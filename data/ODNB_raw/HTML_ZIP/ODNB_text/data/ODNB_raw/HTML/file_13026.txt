<span class="headword">Herbert,  George Augustus</span>, eleventh earl of Pembroke and eighth earl of Montgomery  (1759&#150;1827), <span class="occ">army officer and landowner</span>, was born on 10 September 1759 at Wilton House, Wiltshire, and was baptized there on 29 October, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13034/', "Henry Herbert, tenth earl of Pembroke and seventh earl of Montgomery (1734&#150;1794)")</script>, an army officer, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Spencer (1737&#150;1831) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68361/', "Herbert, Elizabeth, countess of Pembroke and Montgomery")</script>], a lady of the royal household and the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26118/', "Charles Spencer, third duke of Marlborough")</script>. Styled Lord Herbert, he was educated at home and at Harrow School from 1770 to 1775. He was appointed ensign in the 12th foot in 1775 and for the following five years undertook extensive travels to France, Austria, eastern Europe, Russia, and Italy with the Revd William Coxe, later archdeacon of Winchester, and Captain John Floyd. Having been promoted lieutenant in 1777 he became captain in the 75th foot in January 1778 and held the same rank in the 1st (Royal) Dragoons from December that year. He secured a majority in the 22nd light dragoons in 1781 and late the following year was made lieutenant-colonel in the 2nd dragoon guards.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1780, having just come of age, Herbert was returned to parliament for the family borough of Wilton, and in the Commons he sided reluctantly and silently with the whig opposition. He held the seat until November 1784, when he was appointed vice-chamberlain of the household and was sworn of the privy council (17 November), and again from January 1788. On 8 April 1787 he married his first cousin Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1793), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1849/', "Topham Beauclerk")</script> and Lady Diana Spencer [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1848/', "Beauclerk, Lady Diana")</script>]. They had three sons and one daughter. At the start of the French revolutionary wars he showed considerable gallantry in skirmishing actions in Flanders, where he commanded the 2nd and 3rd dragoon guards and liaised with the Prussian and Austrian forces. He played an important part in the siege of Valenciennes in 1793, and at Dunkirk later that year he distinguished himself by capturing an enemy post at Hundssluyt. On his father's death on 26 January 1794 he inherited his titles, as well as Wilton House, the north and west fronts of which were later rebuilt by James Wyatt. His management of the Wilton estates saw the rent roll increase from &pound;35,000 to over &pound;100,000; he also possessed the electoral patronage of the borough. Having relinquished his household position, Pembroke succeeded his father as lord lieutenant of Wiltshire, where he exercised a steady and benign influence in local affairs for the rest of his life. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 February 1794, and thereafter was a staunch, but largely inactive, supporter of the ministry of William Pitt the younger and subsequent tory administrations.<br>
<br>Pembroke was promoted major-general in 1795 and became colonel of the 6th (Inniskilling) dragoons in 1797, after which he held responsibility for the south-western district of England. Having obtained the rank of lieutenant-general in 1802, he was awarded the KG in 1805. In 1807, when he served as plenipotentiary on a special mission to Austria, he was appointed governor of Guernsey. On 25 January 1808 he married Catherine (1783&#150;1856), the daughter of the long-serving Russian ambassador to London, Semyon Romanovich, Count Vorontsov. They had one son and five daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47198/', "Catherine Murray")</script>, promoter of the Harris tweed industry. An honourable and retiring man of amiable disposition, Pembroke, who was made a general in 1812, died at his London residence, Pembroke House, Privy Gardens, Whitehall, on 26 October 1827 and was buried at Wilton on 12 November. As he had quarrelled with Robert Henry, the sole surviving son of his first marriage, who succeeded to his titles, over an unfortunate marriage to an Italian princess, he left the bulk of his unentailed and personal estate, which included personalty sworn under &pound;600,000, to his only son by his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13047/', "Sidney Herbert, later Lord Herbert of Lea")</script>.<br>
