<span class="headword">Perrinchief,  Richard</span>  (1620/21&#150;1673), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Gabriel Perrinchief, a joiner of St Botolph, Aldersgate, London. He entered the school at Christ's Hospital, London, on 15 April 1625, aged four, and matriculated as a sizar at King's College, Cambridge, in the Lent term of 1638. He graduated BA from Magdalene College, Cambridge, early in 1642, proceeded MA in 1645, and was elected to a fellowship at Magdalene at some time thereafter. He was ordained deacon and priest at Lincoln on 3 July 1646 and ejected from his fellowship in 1650. In 1656 he was admitted by the triers to the rectory of Middleton in Hampshire. His first published work was <span class="italic">Nuntius a mortuis</span>, published in Paris in 1657 and in London two years later. Between the two editions he published in 1658 a version in English, <span class="italic">A Messenger from the Dead, or, Conference &hellip; between the Ghosts of Henry the 8. and Charls the First</span>. King Charles, &#145;the most moderate, and the most innocent&#146; of Henry VIII's successors, was seen as the victim of the working out of divine providence punishing the sacrilege and tyranny of the Tudor sovereign to the third and fourth generations  (p. 18); it concluded with Charles resolutely asserting his commitment to the Church of England.<br>
<br>Perrinchief dedicated <span class="italic">The Syracusan Tyrant &hellip; with some Reflexions on the Practices of our Modern Usurpers</span> (1661) to Thomas Wriothesley, earl of Southampton; this book was republished in 1676 as <span class="italic">The Sicilian Tyrant</span>. In both editions an engraving showed &#145;Tyrannus&#146;, in the form of Oliver Cromwell dressed in dubious antique armour, being crowned with a laurel wreath by &#145;Perfidia&#146; and &#145;Crudelitas&#146;. Perrinchief was made rector of St Mildred Poultry, London, in 1661, to which the parish of St Mary Colechurch was annexed in February 1671. He was employed by the bookseller Richard Royston to finalize <span class="italic"><i>Basilika</i>: the Works of Charles I</span> (1662) after the original editor, William Fulham, was incapacitated by smallpox. <span class="italic"><i>Basilika</i></span> contained a biography of Charles I, which Perrinchief wrote with the aid of materials supplied by Silius Titus. This biography was republished as <span class="italic">The Royal Martyr</span> in 1676.<br>
<br>Perrinchief proceeded DD from Cambridge on 2 July 1663; his dissertations were published in <span class="italic">Potestas ecclesiae</span> (1663). In 1664 he published <span class="italic">Samaritanism</span>, an argument against &#145;Comprehending, Compounding, and Tolerating Several Religions in one Church&#146;; a &#145;Revised&#146; and &#145;Enlarged&#146; edition of this title appeared in 1669. On 3 November 1664 he was made a prebendary of St Peter's, Westminster Abbey, and on 2 August 1667 he was installed as a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral. He was also sub-almoner to Charles II. On 7 November 1666 he preached a sermon before the House of Commons which attacked those who denied that the plague was the result of divine punishment. In 1667 he published <span class="italic">A Discourse of Toleration</span> to refute the arguments of John Corbet's <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Religion of England</span>, and in the following year his <span class="italic">Indulgence Not Justified</span> was published. On 29 March 1670 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Huntingdon. In February 1672 John Evelyn heard him preach at Whitehall in the presence of the king on <span class="roman">Acts</span> 17: 31, and in September of the same year he heard him preach to the royal household in Whitehall on <span class="roman">Ephesians</span> 5: 2.<br>
<br>Perrinchief's will, dated 26 August 1673, five days before his death, expressed the desire to be buried as near as possible to his wife, who had been buried in Westminster Abbey two years earlier, on 15 June 1671. Under the terms of this will he bequeathed his divinity books to the library of Westminster Abbey, and gave &pound;100 to Christ Church Hospital. He also made bequests to his &#145;worthy and good Friend&#146; Dr John Dolben and to his &#145;very good friends&#146; Dr William Clarke, dean of Winchester, and Mr Pocock, rector of Long Ditton in Surrey. He appointed Clarke and Pocock as executors of his estate and asked that they should use any money left after his debts had been settled to purchase &#145;some Impropriation or part of some Impropriation in some Great Markett Towne&#146; in Huntingdonshire. If this did not happen within three years he nominated new executors who were to distribute the money to &#145;Prisoners for debt or others That by these Badd tymes have fallen to decay&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/343, fol. 86<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). He died at Westminster on 31 August 1673, and was buried two days later &#145;within the South monument door&#146;  (Chester, 181) of Westminster Abbey.<br>
