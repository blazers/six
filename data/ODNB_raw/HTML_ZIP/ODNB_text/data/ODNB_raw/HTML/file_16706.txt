<span class="headword">Lindsay,  John</span>, seventeenth earl of Crawford and first earl of Lindsay <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>earl of Crawford-Lindsay]</span>  (1596&#150;1678), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Robert, ninth Lord Lindsay of the Byres (<i>d</i>. 1616), and Lady Christian Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1646), eldest daughter of Thomas, first earl of Haddington. He is said to have received &#145;a noble education both at home and in foreign parts&#146;  (Lindsay). He was served heir to his father on 1 October 1616. By 1630 he had married Lady Margaret Hamilton, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12085/', "James Hamilton, second marquess of Hamilton")</script>. Their first daughter was baptized on 1 September 1631; they had four other daughters and five sons.<h2>
<a name="Oppositionpeerandthebishopswars"></a>Opposition peer and the bishops' wars</h2>On 8 May 1633 Lindsay was created earl of Lindsay and Lord Parbroath, but the patent was held back until 1641 due to his opposition to the policies of the Caroline administration of Scotland. He made his objections to the king's ecclesiastical policy clear as early as in the 1633 parliament, and he was prominent in the opposition to the introduction of the Scottish prayer book in 1637, being one of the noblemen who protected the conventicles that had sprung up in Fife. In the 1638 parliament he became a member of the Tables, the provisional government in Edinburgh, and was one of only four nobles appointed to decide on the measures to be taken against the prayer book; at that time he was described as one of the &#145;cheife Covenanter lords&#146;  (Gordon, 1.68) and of the &#145;professed Covenanters&#146;  (ibid., 1.109). On 24 September 1638 he was appointed a commissioner to oversee the subscription in Fife of the 1580 confession and the 1589 general band. On 3 October 1638 he presented a complaint of the presbyterian nobles to James Hamilton, third marquess of Hamilton, which protested against the attempts to force the people to subscribe the king's covenant. His high-profile role at the 1638 general assembly in Glasgow was reflected in his appointment on 27 November to the committee which met beforehand in private with the moderator, Alexander Henderson, to discuss the order of proceedings. He was also involved in an assembly committee which discussed the rivalry between the towns of Ayr and St Andrews for the appointment of Robert Blair as minister.<br>
<br>Lindsay attended the 1639 parliament and on 31 August he was elected to be one of the lords of the articles. On 28 September he was appointed to a subcommittee which was to inquire about the condition of the University of St Andrews and then report back to the articles; four weeks later he was made responsible for drafting an act of visitation. In the June 1640 parliamentary session Lindsay was a member of the session committee for furnishing provisions for the army (3 June) and the committee of estates (8 June). Meanwhile he witnessed military action in the first and second bishops' wars. He raised a regiment in 1639 and his foot regiment of 1000 men took part in the battle of Newburn in August 1640.<br>
<br>Lindsay maintained a high parliamentary profile throughout 1640&#150;41. In April and May 1641 he was a member of the delegation of the committee of estates which was to consider the continuation and prorogation of parliament. He was appointed to several important committees in the session of 15 July &#150; 17 November 1641. On 28 August he was selected to be one of the Scottish diplomatic commissioners to negotiate with representatives of the English parliament concerning the ratification of the articles of the peace treaty following the second bishops' war. On 8 October he was included on the committee to consider the petition of General Major Monro and his regiment, who were seeking approval of their military service. He was also involved in the parliamentary investigation into the &#145;Incident&#146;, the plot by royalists to murder the leading proponents of the new order, Argyll, Hamilton, and Lanark, and was instructed on 30 October to attend the king to hear the reading of a letter from the earl of Montrose concerning these events. On 11 November he was a member of the session committee to consider which acts were to be passed in parliament, while on 13 November he was appointed a treasury commissioner and was included on the new privy council, as well as being appointed as an extraordinary lord of session. He was placed on interval committees for the plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds, for the visitation of St Andrews University, and (the most important for the conduct of covenanting diplomacy) the committee anent the articles referred to consideration by the treaty and the committee for conserving the articles of the treaty (conservators of the peace). It was as part of the king's attempt to conciliate leading covenanters that he received the grant of his earldom from Charles I during the king's visit to Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarynegotiatorandarmyofficer16411644"></a>Parliamentary negotiator and army officer, 1641&#150;1644</h2>At the first meeting of the new privy council on 18 November 1641 Lindsay was commissioned with the earl of Lothian to proceed to London to discuss the recent Irish rising with the English parliament, and the decision of the covenanters to offer 10,000 men to help suppress it. They were also instructed to act as peacemakers between the king and the English parliament. On 11 March 1642 Lindsay was given the command of a regiment in the covenanting army which was being sent to serve in Ulster, although he never took up the commission personally. Early in March 1643 he contributed two sums of &pound;500 Scots (3 March) and &pound;6000 Scots (7 March) for the maintenance of the Scottish army in Ulster. As a privy councillor he was appointed on 5 July 1642 to be a commissioner for Fife for the apprehension of Jesuits, priests, and those undertaking pilgrimages to chapels and wells, and on 8 June 1643 to be one of the commissioners to take depositions concerning the murder of one Alexander Stuart, a former student of St Andrews University.<br>
<br>Lindsay played an important role in the 1643 convention of estates (22 June &#150; 26 August) and the securing of the solemn league and covenant. He was a member of a number of committees, including those concerned with the trial of the earls of Traquair and Carnwath, remedies of the dangers of religion (11 July), and the army (4 August), meeting with the English commissioners (9 and 10 August), and he was at the heart of the negotiations which led to the solemn league and covenant, not only as a parliamentary representative, but also as a ruling elder of the general assembly. Indeed, he was a member of the general assembly's commission of the kirk in 1643, 1644, 1645, and 1647. On 17 August Lindsay produced the solemn league and covenant before the assembled convention. On 26 August he was appointed to the new committee of estates and was a member of the shire committee of war for Fife and Kinross. He signed the treaty of military assistance with the English parliament as one of the Scottish diplomatic representatives on 29 November 1643. On 1 December Lindsay was included in the section of the committee of estates which was to accompany the covenanting army into England in January, although he stayed in Edinburgh to attend the opening diets of the convention between 3 and 11 January.<br>
<br>The presbyteries of Cupar and St Andrews raised ten companies of men for Lindsay in the army. He distinguished himself in action at the battle of Marston Moor on 2 July 1644. According to Robert Baillie, he incurred &#145;the greatest hazard of any&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 2.204) when he charged and dislodged four brigades of royalist troops. In the aftermath of the battle he wrote to the estates suggesting a general thanksgiving for the victory.<br>
<br>On the expiry of the Scottish Treasury commission, Lindsay was on 23 July appointed treasurer by parliament and the next day he was included on the renewed commission for the plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds. Following the forfeiture of Ludovic, earl of Crawford, on 26 July, the titles and dignities of the earl of Crawford were ratified to Lindsay and he became known as the earl of Crawford-Lindsay. That day he was also included on the army section of the committee of estates.<h2>
<a name="Managingwar16451648"></a>Managing war, 1645&#150;1648</h2>Owing to the ill health of the president of parliament, John Maitland, earl of Lauderdale, on 11 January 1645 Crawford-Lindsay was appointed vice-president and then on 20 January, following Lauderdale's death, president. Since as president he had access to and an entitlement to preside over all parliamentary committees, he played a key constitutional and political role; in the event he presided in all the remaining sessions of the first triennial parliament until it concluded its business on 27 March 1647. He was a member of the committee appointed on 10 January for managing the war within and without the country, which dealt with the Montrose rebellion and covenanting military commitments outside Scotland, and of similar committees established in 1645&#150;6, such as those for managing the war (8 July), for the prosecution of the war (29 July), for dispatches (1 December 1645), and for common burdens (10 November 1646). On 8 March 1645 he was included on the section of the committee of estates which was to accompany the covenanting army in Scotland against Montrose and, in the absence of Chancellor Loudoun, he was to preside over it. He was also involved in the ensuing military operations and was a member of the covenanting committee advising General Baillie on strategy. In this capacity he must bear the partial burden of responsibility for the covenanting defeat at Kilsyth on 17 August 1645 when he, and other leading covenanters, persuaded a reluctant General Baillie to abandon his superior position and attack Montrose's forces. Crawford-Lindsay's own regiment suffered heavily at Kilsyth and according to Robert Blair the &#145;whole regiment was cut off almost wholly&#146;  (Lindsay, 2.73). Indeed, it was one of the few regular units of the army of the solemn league and covenant to be destroyed in battle.<br>
<br>In May 1646 Crawford-Lindsay was appointed temporary president of the privy council in the absence of Chancellor Loudoun. On 10 December he received a formal ratification from the king of his previous appointment as treasurer and he was one of the Scottish deputies sent to England following the capture of the king to try and persuade Charles to agree to the Newcastle propositions. He protested against the parliamentary decision of 16 January 1647 to withdraw the covenanting army from England and hand Charles over to the jurisdiction of the English parliament in return for arrears of pay. He did sign the act for the surrender of the king, but he only agreed to do so in the constitutional capacity of president and not of his own personal accord. On 19 January an act was passed in his favour for reimbursement of &pound;23,799 14<i>s</i>. Scots which he had previously lent for the public service.<br>
<br>Crawford-Lindsay was closely involved with the engagement following the king's imprisonment at Carisbrooke. He was present in the Engagement Parliament of 1648, although Chancellor Loudoun was elected as president. He served on committees for the garrisoning of Berwick and Carlisle and for war in Fife and Kinross, as well as those of estates on 11 May and 9 June. In March he became involved in a dispute in parliament with Archibald Campbell, eighth earl of Argyll, over whether or not Crawford-Lindsay had said that he was a &#145;better man&#146; than Argyll, and over the former's response that he &#145;would not make accompt to Argyle what he said; but whatever it was, he would make it good with his sword&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.36). A duel was arranged for seven o'clock on a Sunday morning at Musselburgh Links. Both parties kept the appointment, but the duel did not take place. According to Henry Guthrie this was due to the reluctance of both men to fight, despite being at the scene for over an hour &#145;so that they had leisure enough to have fought if they had been willing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Memoirs</span>, 261), but Baillie's explanation focused on the intervention of outside parties; &#145;by God's providence, before they began their pley, some fell on them, and made them part without a stroke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.36). Furthermore, the privy council, &#145;with much adoe, gott them to a professed coldryse friendship&#146;  (ibid.). Both men faced the wrath of the commission of the kirk and on 22 March they &#145;professed their sorrow for any scandall they had given by the late combat&#146;  (Mitchell and Christie, 1646&#150;7, 405&#150;6). Argyll adhered to repentance before the commission, but Crawford-Lindsay refused to do so and the commission was still urging him to repent for the combat as late as 8 June.<h2>
<a name="InterregnumroyalismandRestorationretirement"></a>Interregnum, royalism, and Restoration retirement</h2>Following the battle of Preston in August 1648 and the installation of a political regime of radical covenanters in Edinburgh, backed by Oliver Cromwell, Crawford-Lindsay was deprived of his offices, including on 13 February 1649 that of treasurer, because of his involvement with the engagement. He also came under the scope of the 1649 <span class="roman">Act of Classes</span>. In December that year he refused to subscribe a band acknowledging the legality of the current parliament and he was apprehended at Elie, Fife, on the point of departure for the Netherlands. He was returned to his own home, although no further action was taken against him. In January 1650, however, he subscribed a band for the peace of the country. As events unfolded in Scotland in 1650&#150;51 he returned to political life, joining the patriotic accommodation against the Cromwellian advance. In December 1650 he was appointed as a colonel of foot in Fife and he carried the sceptre at the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1651. He also entertained the king at his house of the Struthers between 15 and 17 February 1651. He was a member of the committee for managing the affairs of the army of 28 March, playing an important role liaising with the commission of the kirk, and of the committee of estates of 3 June.<br>
<br>When the king marched into England in the summer of 1651, Crawford-Lindsay was appointed lieutenant-general under the earl of Leven. By 18 July 1651 his regiment of foot consisted of 1045 men, and following Charles II's invasion of England by the army of the kingdom Crawford-Lindsay became &#145;the effective commander-in-chief of forces in Scotland&#146;  (Furgol, 367). He was later captured along with other members of the committee of estates at Alyth on 28 August. He was initially imprisoned in the Tower of London and then Sandown Castle, but on 27 November 1656 he was transferred to Windsor Castle, where he was to remain until the end of his captivity. He was excepted from Cromwell's <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span> and he was forfeited at Edinburgh Cross on 5 May 1654.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Crawford-Lindsay was freed from imprisonment and in December 1660 he returned to Scotland. He was present at the parliament in Scotland which met on 1 January 1661, and he was included in the membership of commissions to the lords of articles and processes (8 January), for trade and complaints (8 January), and for plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds (6 March). On 29 January parliament confirmed a patent issued by the king making Crawford-Lindsay treasurer for life and an act of 13 February exonerated his role in the decision of 16 January 1647 to leave Charles I in England. He was appointed on 29 March an excise commissioner for Fife and Kinross and on 5 April an extraordinary lord of session. Nevertheless, he opposed the rescissory act of 28 March and was against the restoration of episcopacy in Scotland. He was a member of the new privy council, over which he was to preside in the absence of Chancellor Glencairn. He did not attend the parliamentary sessions of 1662 and 1663 and he resigned all his offices in 1663 and withdrew from public life rather than accept the revival of episcopacy. As a committed presbyterian, he is often mentioned in the parish register of Ceres. Although on 20 May 1663 he became one of the original members of the Royal Society, he took up residence at his estate of Struthers and died at Tynninghame there in 1678. His wife was living in 1666, but the date of her death is unknown. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16717/', "William Lindsay (1644&#150;1698)")</script>, their eldest surviving son, succeeded to the earldom.<br>
