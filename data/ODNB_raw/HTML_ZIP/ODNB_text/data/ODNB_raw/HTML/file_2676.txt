</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bloomfield,  Robert</span>  (1766&#150;1823), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 3 December 1766 at Honington, a village in Suffolk, the son of George Bloomfield (<i>d</i>. 1767), a village tailor, and Elizabeth Manby (<i>d</i>. 1803), schoolmistress at Honington. His father died of smallpox when Robert was a year old and left the family of three boys and three girls penniless. His mother augmented her earnings from her position as schoolmistress by spinning wool, but the family struggled. It was mainly under his mother's tutelage that Bloomfield learned to read and write at an early age, though he did spend three months in 1772 learning to write from a Mr Rodwell of Ixworth. Bloomfield's early reading included Thomas Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</span> and Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">The Deserted Village</span>, both of which were to influence him greatly in his own poetic compositions.<br>
<br>Before Bloomfield turned seven, his mother married a man named John Glover, and additional children appeared on the scene, crowding even further the already cramped house. In or about 1778 Bloomfield was sent to his mother's brother-in-law, William Austin of Sapiston, who worked a farm in the manor of the duke of Grafton, who would later become Bloomfield's patron. Though assuming the humble position of &#145;farmer's boy&#146; on his uncle's farm, he was treated decently, and details of his uncle's benevolence, as well as nostalgia for this period of his life, in which he experienced his first intimacy with nature, are present in <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span>. It became apparent by the time Bloomfield was fifteen, however, that, owing to his slight build (even in his maturity, Bloomfield was barely 5 feet tall), he was not cut out for the rigours of farm labour, and so Austin advised Bloomfield's mother to find him a situation more suited to his physical capabilities.<h2>
<a name="London"></a>London</h2>Bloomfield's mother turned to her eldest sons, George and Nathaniel (the latter of whom, in a bid to capitalize on his younger brother's notoriety, also tried his hand at poetry, though with little success), then living in London, who offered to take their younger brother into their charge. It was decided that George, a shoemaker, would take in Robert and teach him the trade, while Nathaniel, a tailor, would provide the neophyte cobbler with clothing. Accordingly, on 29 June 1781, Bloomfield and his mother completed the stagecoach trip to London, where he was left in his brothers' keeping. Thus Bloomfield lived for a time with his brother George and four other cobblers in a small, low-rent garret (which also doubled as their workshop) at 7 Pitcher's Court, Bell Alley, Coleman Street. There he began learning to make shoes but earned his keep mainly by running errands and reading the newspaper aloud to the others while they worked. After he complained that he did not understand many of the words he was reading, George bought him a used dictionary, which greatly aided him in his mission to educate himself. He also enthusiastically attended the popular Sunday evening lectures of a dissenting minister, the Revd Mr Fawcet, who held forth weekly to standing room only audiences at a meeting-house in the Old Jewry.<br>
<br>About 1783, apparently unsettled by the epileptic fits of a new lodger at Pitcher's Court, Robert and George decamped and took up residence at Blue Hart Court, Bell Alley. Another lodger there, James Kay generously lent Robert a number of books, among them <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> and James Thomson's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>, the latter of which became his favourite reading material. Over the years Bloomfield developed a prodigious memory for poetry and could recite any passage from <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> or Thomson's <span class="italic">The Castle of Indolence</span>, as well as large swathes of Burns.<br>
<br>In 1784, fearing prosecution by the Committee of the Lawful Crafts for illegally cobbling without having been officially apprenticed, Bloomfield fled back to the sanctuary of his uncle Austin's farm. During this period Bloomfield fell in love with a woman from Broadmere named Nancy Bantock, but the relationship did not work out, and Bantock eventually married a local man.<br>
<br>Despite ongoing legal difficulties Bloomfield returned to London after a two-month retreat and managed to finagle a quasi-legal standing as a cobbler by paying 5<i>s</i>. to John Dudbridge, who acted as his pro forma journey master. By 1786 Bloomfield was a skilled enough shoemaker to make his own way, and his brother George left London.<br>
<br>It was also about this time that the earliest evidence that Bloomfield was composing poetry surfaces. Poems that he had apparently composed in his mind while engaged in cobbling and later copied down were dispatched to the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> for publication in the &#145;Poet's corner&#146;, but his earliest published poem, &#145;A Village Girl&#146;, appeared in Mary Say's <span class="italic">Gazetter</span> for 24 May 1786. Bloomfield also acquired a violin and a taste for music. In an act rich with symbolism for a nature poet living during the Romantic period, he also began hand-crafting aeolian harps, an avocation which eventually afforded him a small income. He actually once sold an aeolian harp of his own manufacture to James Montgomery.<br>
<br>Within four years, however, Bloomfield wrote to his brother George that he &#145;had sold his Fiddle and got a Wife&#146;  (Lofft, xiii). On 12 December 1790 Bloomfield married Mary-Anne Church, the daughter of a shipbuilder from Woolwich. Their first child, Hannah, was born on 25 October 1791. In the following year the Bloomfields took up residence at 14 Bell Alley, Coleman Street, where the growing family lived and struggled to make ends meet for the next seven years.<h2>
<a name="TheFarmersBoy"></a>The Farmer's Boy</h2>In May 1796 Bloomfield began composing a poem that he at first intended only to be a present for his mother, but which eventually grew into <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span>, the poem on which his reputation as a minor poet of the period chiefly rests. Like Thomson's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>, <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span> (nearly 1500 lines in heroic couplets) is divided into four parts, with each part corresponding to one of the seasons. It depicts the experiences of Giles, a young farm boy, as he does his chores and communes with nature. After three publishers in London had rejected the work (even when, after the first rejection, Bloomfield offered to underwrite the publication costs), Bloomfield gave up trying to get the poem published and presented the manuscript to his brother George for his personal enjoyment and that of his friends. In November 1798, however, George showed the manuscript to Capel Lofft, the radical editor and writer and a prominent figure in Suffolk society, who liked it well enough to make grammatical and orthographical amendments to the text and shepherd the poem into print along with his own evaluative preface. The publishers Vernor and Hood agreed to publish <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span>, but it did not begin to appear in shops until March 1800. It was immediately popular and even achieved critical success, such as Bloomfield never managed to achieve with subsequent works. It brought him to the attention of Robert Southey, who gave the book a favourable review and who remained Bloomfield's greatest champion among the Romantics. Given his predominant themes of nature and the common man, it is also understandable that William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge initially reacted with plaudits (in 1802 Coleridge reckoned Bloomfield among the major contemporary poets), but this laudatory reception lapsed over the years into indifference. Other authors of the period, such as Lord Byron and Charles Lamb, were less than charitable in their assessments of his poetic worth. In any event, the success of <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span> thrust the cobbler-poet into a limelight which proved to be simultaneously gratifying and irksome to a man who was by nature modest and retiring. Though he was initially circumspect about the income to be derived from the poem's publication, it was difficult for Bloomfield not to imagine that a better life for him and his family was at hand.<br>
<br>After a brief respite, however, Bloomfield continued to experience financial difficulties, exacerbated by the demands his celebrity placed on his time. Sitting for portraits, visiting in high society, and otherwise satisfying the public's curiosity about his person and poem detracted from the time he spent cobbling, which was still his main source of income. Though he contemplated other occupations, none of these came to fruition and by September 1801 he was forced to apply for an advance from his publishers. Luckily, however, Bloomfield had continued to write during this period, and though he was caught up in a messy quarrel between his then patron Capel Lofft and his publishers, and suffering from rheumatism and the recurrence of a stomach ailment, his financial prospects seemed excellent as his <span class="italic">Rural Tales, Ballads, and Songs</span> went to press in the autumn of 1801 and new editions of <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span> continued to come out. <span class="italic">Rural Tales</span> contains shorter poems in various metres, mostly vignettes and lyrics depicting the joys and vicissitudes of rural life and the folk ways of villagers. The themes may be compared to those in the poems by George Crabbe or even Wordsworth, taking common folk and their lives for their subject matter. This was a trend Bloomfield continued in much of his other poetry.<br>
<br>In addition to his income from his two books, his cobbling, and his manufacture of aeolian harps, Bloomfield also began to receive an annuity of &pound;15 from the duke of Grafton. Characteristically, Bloomfield generously shared his income with his brother George and his mother. Bloomfield's good financial fortunes seemed to wax even further when in late 1802 the duke of Grafton appointed him to the position of undersealer in the king's bench court. But Bloomfield, who always craved more peaceful surroundings, found the hustle and bustle of the court noxious and resolved in the spring of 1803 to resign his post at the seal office.<br>
<br>Bloomfield's mother died at the end of 1803, and Bloomfield's extraordinary generosity to her heirs and his stepfather, as well as expenditures on his mother's care in her decline and her funeral again landed him in financial difficulties. Bloomfield was also coping at this time with the illness of his son Charles, who had issued into the world about the same time as <span class="italic">The Farmer's Boy</span>. Charles had developed a swelling on his knee and suffered from convulsions, a condition that lingered over the following three years and left the boy disabled. His son's illness had a profound impact on Bloomfield and he resolved to do what he could to keep his family healthy. Bloomfield, who had befriended Dr Edward Jenner, had for some time been interested in Jenner's controversial smallpox vaccine. When his brother Nathaniel lost a third child in 1802 to the disease which had also killed their father, Bloomfield decided to have his family inoculated. He even championed Jenner's cause in a poem at once didactic and melodramatic called &#145;Good Tidings&#146;, which was published in 1804, but did not do well.<br>
<br>In 1806 Bloomfield published a new book of poems dedicated to his by then disabled son, entitled <span class="italic">Wild Flowers, or, Pastoral and Local Poetry</span>. Also published in the same year was a book of illustrations of Suffolk by the engravers Storer and Grieg, whose interest in the region was inspired by Bloomfield's poetry. In 1807 Bloomfield went on a rejuvenating ten-day tour along the Wye with Mr and Mrs Thomas J. Baker and others from Gloucestershire. Mightily impressed with the mountainous countryside and delighted with his companions, Bloomfield kept a poetical journal of his experiences during this expedition. He worked in fits and starts over the next three years polishing and expanding what he had begun in the journal and it was finally published in 1811 as <span class="italic">The Banks of the Wye: a Poem</span>.<h2>
<a name="Financialdifficultiesandfinalyears"></a>Financial difficulties and final years</h2>Despite the cheer brought by the publication of <span class="italic">The Banks of the Wye</span> and its initial commercial success, in keeping with the pattern his life had taken on, Bloomfield was beset with other sadnesses and difficulties. First, there was the death of his patron the old duke of Grafton, who was succeeded by his son Lord Charles Fitzroy. The new duke of Grafton did not share his father's enthusiasm for cobbler-poets, and Bloomfield had to enlist the services of Capel Lofft to petition the new duke for his &pound;15 annuity, which Fitzroy eventually granted but was thereafter sometimes desultory in supplying. The second blow came when Mr Hood, the most active member of Bloomfield's publishers, died, and the business passed into the hands of another partner, named, appropriately enough, Sharpe. By 1812 Sharpe had brought the firm near to bankruptcy and decided to bail out. He sold 4500 copies of Bloomfield's books to another bookseller and although he received &pound;509 and a line of credit for himself, he refused to give Bloomfield his due. The Bloomfield family, now consisting of five children, was forced to borrow money, leave the expensive city, and retire to Shefford in Bedfordshire. Bloomfield returned to London in October 1812 to attend to his business matters, and although he was eventually able to secure an advance from Crosby, the bookseller to whom Sharpe had sold Bloomfield's lot, Bloomfield was by this time disgusted with the publishing business; he wrote a letter saying as much to his family, and signed it &#145;Your cheated and bamboozled Father&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selections</span>, 55). Nor was London conducive to the production of poetry, for in another letter he complained, &#145;I can write only as Rabbits <i>S&#151;t</i>, in little bits, for the cart wheels roar, and the waiters are noisy, and there is a chimney on fire within sight, and a brave crowd&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 28268, fols. 330&#150;331).<br>
<br>Despite numerous journeys to London, efforts over the next few years to secure revenues from the sales and copyrights of his books were not very successful, and the Bloomfield family suffered for it. In 1814 Bloomfield's daughter Mary Anne died. In the next year, Bloomfield was forced to find Charles an apprenticeship and also placed Charlotte at a milliner's. The publication of a children's book, <span class="italic">The History of Little Davy's New Hat</span>, did not bring much relief, and the Bloomfields were forced to move to a less expensive house. By 1816 Bloomfield's health, never robust, was failing, and his financial distress so great that it prompted Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges and other supporters to issue a subscription on his behalf. This small income, along with what the duke of Grafton begrudgingly supplied, was augmented when in 1817 Bloomfield found Charles a position as a schoolmaster, and the Bloomfield family were able to pay off some debts. Bloomfield was thereby able to resume with renewed enthusiasm a project that he had begun years before and which culminated in the 1822 publication of <span class="italic">May-Day with the Muses</span>, the last of his books published while he was still alive. Hearing that George Crabbe had been handsomely paid by the publisher Murray for his <span class="italic">Tales</span>, Bloomfield tried in the spring of 1820 to place <span class="italic">May-Day</span> with Murray. Murray, however, declined to publish the book, and Bloomfield was forced to go with the publishers Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy.<br>
<br>Bloomfield was also contending in the last years of his life with attacks on his reputation. He had heard a report from Thomas Baker that rumours concerning his political and religious beliefs and his associates were in circulation&#151;rumours which might estrange the poet's patrons and conservative audience. In short, he was rumoured to be &#145;Deistical and Republican&#146; in outlook  (BL, Add. MS 28268, fols. 415&#150;416). Baker even went so far as to solicit from Bloomfield a direct and public denial of such charges, but Bloomfield's partly indignant, partly whimsical response asserted that although such accusations were groundless, no such denial would be forthcoming. Bloomfield further noted that political liberals had also attempted to besmirch his name; apparently William Cobbett had accused Bloomfield of following a governmental directive to avoid writing about commoners in an ennobling light. Bloomfield's last word on the topic came in the &#145;Preface&#146; to the first edition of <span class="italic">May-Day</span>, where he obliquely denied the rumours about him: &#145;I have been reported to be dead; but I can assure the reader this, like many other reports, is not true&#146;  (p. viii).<br>
<br>Although Bloomfield found some happiness in the final year of his life through a reawakened interest in John Clare's poetry and by attempting to finish some poetical projects he had begun years before, his deteriorating health and financial situation made composition of new material difficult. Still, his chief anxieties were for his children, and for their sake he continued working until the very last months of his life. Bloomfield died on 19 August 1823 in Bloomfield House, Bedford Street, Shefford. Sadly, his family were left so destitute that they had to auction Bloomfield's books and even their household items to pay off debts. Bloomfield was buried in the country churchyard at Campton, Bedfordshire. The epitaph on his headstone read &#145;Let His Wild Native Wood Notes Tell the Rest&#146;.<br>
