<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mason, Sir  Josiah</span>  (1795&#150;1881), <span class="occ">pen-nib manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, was born on 23 February 1795 at Mill Street, Kidderminster, the second son of Josiah Mason, carpet weaver, and his wife Elizabeth Griffiths. At the age of eight he commenced selling cakes in the streets, and afterwards fruit and vegetables, which he carried from door to door on a donkey. He taught himself shoemaking in 1810, and was afterwards a carpenter, a blacksmith, and a house-painter. In 1814 he became a carpet weaver, and from 1817 to 1822 he acted as manager of the imitation-gold jewellery works of his uncle, Richard Griffiths of Birmingham. On 18 August 1817 Mason married the latter's daughter, his cousin Anne Griffiths (<i>d</i>. 24 Feb 1870). They had no children. Mason subsequently became manager of Samuel Harrison's business producing split rings in 1824, and a year later he purchased the business for &pound;500. He then invented a device for making split keyrings by machinery, which proved to be profitable.<br>
<br>Other manufacturers, including John and William Mitchell and Joseph Gillott, had already commenced making steel pens, and in 1829 Mason also began to produce them. He made the acquaintance of James Perry, a stationer, of Red Lion Square, London, and acted as his pen maker for many years. These pens, however, bore the name of the seller, Perry, and not of the manufacturer, Mason. The first order of 100 gross of pens was sent to London on 20 November 1830. About twelve workpeople were employed, and up to 1 hundredweight of steel was rolled in a week. In 1874 one thousand persons were employed, the quantity of steel rolled every week exceeded 3 tons, and on an average one and a half million pens were produced from each ton of steel. By this time Mason had become the owner of the largest pen-nib manufactory in the world.<br>
<br>In 1844 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8640/', "George Elkington (1801&#150;1865)")</script> took out a patent for the use of cyanides of gold and silver in electroplating, and, requiring capital to develop the business, he and his cousin Henry Elkington were joined by Mason. The electroplated spoons, forks, and other articles soon came into use, and their popularity was much increased after the Great Exhibition of 1851. Having made a large sum of money in this connection, Mason retired from the firm in 1856. But, with Elkington, he also established copper-smelting works at Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, and became a nickel smelter. In December 1875 he sold his pen manufactory to a limited liability company. Mason died at Norwood House, Erdington, Warwickshire, on 16 June 1881. His estate was valued at &pound;51,729 5<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Much of Mason's wealth (estimated to be in the order of half a million pounds) had been spent on charitable causes during his own lifetime. In 1858 he founded almshouses in Erdington village for thirty aged women and an orphanage for fifty girls. Between 1860 and 1868 he spent &pound;60,000 on the erection of a new orphanage at Erdington, and then, by a deed executed in August 1868, he transferred the edifice, together with an endowment in land and buildings valued at &pound;200,000, to a body of seven trustees. This orphanage was capable of receiving three hundred girls, one hundred and fifty boys, and fifty infants, and remained in existence until 1960. On 30 November 1872 he was knighted. His most important work, the establishment of a scientific college at Birmingham, which cost him over &pound;200,000, was opened on 1 October 1880, and in 1893 had 556 students. The purpose of the college was originally to provide instruction in science, but by 1881 the trustees were permitted to extend this to all branches of science, art, languages, and literature. Mason College was subsequently absorbed into the University of Birmingham, which was founded and incorporated in 1900. Mason's heraldic crest, representing a mermaid, forms part of the coat of arms of the university.<br>
