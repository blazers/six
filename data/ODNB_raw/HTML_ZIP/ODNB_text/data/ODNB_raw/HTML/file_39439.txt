<span class="headword">Armstrong, Sir  Walter</span>  (1849&#150;1918), <span class="occ">museum director and art historian</span>, was born at Hawick, Roxburghshire, on 7 February 1849, the elder of the two sons and three daughters of Walter Armstrong, a merchant described as &#145;a man of handsome fortune&#146;  (Spielmann), and his wife, Mary Graham, and he was baptized on 18 May that year. He was educated at Harrow School and Exeter College, Oxford, where he is said to have &#145;worked not much&#146;  (Spielmann), obtaining only a pass degree. On 11 June 1873 he married Jane Emily Rose, daughter of Charles Cotton Ferrard of Ascot Place, Berkshire; they had five daughters and at least one son.<br>
<br>Soon after Armstrong's marriage his father was financially ruined by the great fraud committed by Messrs Alexander and William Collie against the London and Westminster Bank and the young Armstrong faced difficulties. Fortunately he was just beginning to establish himself as a perceptive art critic and from 1880 began to work for various papers and journals including the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>, the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>; J. Comyns Carr also employed him on the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span>. During the 1880s he also began to publish studies of recent British artists&#151;the sculptor Alfred Stevens (1818&#150;1875) in 1881, and the painters Peter DeWint (1784&#150;1849) in 1888 and Briton Riviere (1840&#150;1920) in 1891. He also revised the second volume of Bryan's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Painters and Engravers</span> (1889) and both translated and edited Georges Perrot's and Charles Chipiez's <span class="italic">Histoire de l'art dans l'antiquit&eacute;</span> (1885). His growing reputation as an expert in seventeenth-century Dutch painting and eighteenth-century British art meant that his advice was sought by collectors, including Samuel Joseph.<br>
<br>Armstrong had a keen eye for a painting and a sure touch as a critic and by the time of his appointment as successor to Henry Edward Doyle as director of the National Gallery of Ireland, in 1892, his personal and professional standing among contemporary artists and art historians was assured. Armstrong's references for the position came from Lord Leighton, who predicted that Armstrong would act with &#145;zeal and solicitude&#146;  (Potterton, xxii), and Abraham Bredius, director of the Mauritshuis, The Hague, who wrote that Armstrong was &#145;one of the best among the very few real connoisseurs of the old Dutch School in England&#146;  (Potterton, xxii). He was in fact the first scholar&#150;director of the gallery and held the post until 1914. During his time as director Armstrong initiated a number of important changes within the gallery. Modern museum practices were introduced with pictures systematically cleaned, framed, and glazed. He completely revised the gallery's catalogue, largely rewriting it to provide a much more detailed and comprehensive account of the gallery's holdings; in this undertaking he was doubtless aided by his &#145;excellent assistant&#146;  (Sutton, 74) the registrar, K. W. Strickland. His acquisitions policy was broad, adding to the gallery's collection of Irish and British paintings, as well as acquiring a number of significant works by Dutch and Italian masters; major acquisitions included Mantegna's <span class="italic">Judith and Holofernes</span> (from the collection of John Malcolm of Poltalloch) and Goya's <span class="italic">Conde de Tajo</span>. He also secured the collection of Edward Nugent, sixth earl of Milltown, by gift of his widow in 1897. The collection included works by Batoni, C.-J. Vernet, Lorenzo Lippi, Poussin's <span class="italic">Holy Family with Ten Figures</span> (1649), and a number of caricature groups of grand tourists by Sir Joshua Reynolds, probably executed for the first earl or his son. However, disputes arose over the number of works to be acquired by the gallery; Armstrong originally selected seventy-two, but Lady Milltown insisted that a far larger number be accepted. In response to the gift the gallery was considerably extended; Armstrong, who played a role in the new design, described the completed building as &#145;the best Picture Gallery in the United Kingdom&#146;  (Potterton, xxv). Armstrong became a JP, and was elected an honorary member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1899, in which year he was also knighted.<br>
<br>Armstrong is also remembered for his series of massive monographs, with accompanying catalogues, of some of the major British painters of the second half of the eighteenth century and the early nineteenth, <span class="italic">Gainsborough</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Reynolds</span> (1900), <span class="italic">Raeburn</span> (with J. L. Caw and R. A. M. Stevenson; 1901), <span class="italic">Turner</span> (1902), and, on a smaller scale, <span class="italic">Lawrence</span> (1913). These handsome tomes, the earlier ones illustrated with photogravure plates and colour lithographs, are geared for use in a country-house library rather than for the student's limited bookshelf space. The catalogue entries have now been superseded, but Armstrong was a pioneer; without these volumes later scholars would have found their task much more difficult. His texts are always thoughtful and possess a literary quality. He also wrote on Vel&aacute;zquez for the <span class="roman">Portfolio</span> series in 1896. He died of angina pectoris at his home, 63 Carlisle Mansions, Westminster, London, on 8 August 1918, his wife surviving him. As a footnote it is worth recording that his three sisters, Mrs Tennant Dunlop, Mrs Secker, and Mrs Ponsonby Blennerhassett, are the sitters in Sir John Everett Millais's celebrated group <span class="italic">Hearts are Trumps</span>, now in the Tate collection, London.<br>
