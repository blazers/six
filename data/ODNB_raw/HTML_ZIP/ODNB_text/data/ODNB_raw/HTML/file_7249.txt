<span class="headword">Davis,  John  Scarlett</span>  (1804&#150;1845), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 1 September 1804 at 2 High Street, Leominster, Herefordshire, the second of the five children of James Davis (1775&#150;1828), silversmith and watchmaker, and Ann Scarlett, a distant relative of Sir James Scarlett (1769&#150;1844), the attorney-general (later Lord Abinger). His Davis forebears had moved from Neath in Glamorgan, Wales, to Leominster at the end of the sixteenth century. At the age of five he demonstrated enthusiasm and talent for drawing; at eleven he copied an anatomical engraving seen in the surgery of the family physician, for which he received a silver palette (awarded by the Society of Arts) from the duke of Sussex, and was declared by the <span class="italic">Hereford Journal</span> of 5 June 1816 to be &#145;a young self-taught genius&#146;. In presenting the prize, the duke observed that Davis was so much younger than the other candidates that at first the duke could not see him&#151;but that his merit was soon apparent.<br>
<br>While at school in Leominster, Davis made a number of pencil portraits of the town's leading citizens, receiving &pound;1 for each. Possibly he was among the private pupils of the landscape watercolourist David Cox, who then lived in Hereford. From early 1818 until December 1819 he boarded at Paul De La Pierre's academy in Well Street, Hackney, Middlesex, and in July 1820 he entered the Royal Academy Schools; in 1822 he first exhibited at the Royal Academy itself, and undertook a sketching tour in Wales, producing a group of drawings now in the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff.<br>
<br>Of the twenty-seven works exhibited in Davis's lifetime at the major London venues, most were oil paintings; and he enjoyed a successful practice as a portrait painter. Yet his modern reputation rests almost entirely on his watercolours&#151;and above all on his interior views, in which his particular genius was revealed. In his freedom and facility of touch he can be regarded as a worthy follower of Richard Parkes Bonington, and the draughtsmanship in some of his interior scenes owes an apparent debt also to Rembrandt.<br>
<br>In 1824 Davis made a series of copy-drawings of the paintings in the Royal Collection and in the marquess of Stafford's gallery at Cleveland House in London. In October 1825 he went to Yorkshire, where he spent the next three years painting portraits (often through introductions supplied by Sir Thomas Lawrence) and showing his work at the Northern Society exhibitions in Leeds. In the 1830s he gained more and more commissions for his interior views of galleries, churches, and (sometimes) palaces. He now toured the continent regularly, often in the company of his wife, Elizabeth Jane Abbott, whom he married on 12 July 1832. He fulfilled a large commission for Lord Farnborough, which included work in the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. His principal patron, however, was the merchant and naval agent John Hinxman, who at his death in 1846 owned 489 of the artist's works. These included <span class="italic">The Long Gallery of the Uffizi, Florence</span> (oils, 1833; exh. RA, 1834; ex-Sothebys, London, 14 July 1993), and his last and probably largest oil, <span class="italic">The Interior of St Peter's, with Figures</span> (7 ft 2 in. &times; 9 ft 10 in.), painted in Rome in 1842. A version is in the City Museum and Art Gallery, Hereford, which holds a diverse collection of his work.<br>
<br>After several years of illness Davis died of &#145;diseased lungs&#146; at 11 Bedford Street, Bloomsbury, London, on 29 September 1845, aged forty-one; he was buried at All Souls, Kensal Green, Middlesex. According to the 1874 edition of Samuel Redgrave's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Artists of the English School</span>, Davis &#145;became drunken and of demoralised habits, got into prison, and died before the age of 30&#146;  (113)&#151;a characterization entirely at odds with his surviving papers (discovered in 1928), which indicate a man settled in his domestic life and dedicated to his art.<br>
