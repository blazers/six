<span class="headword">Watts,  Henry</span>  (1815&#150;1884), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in London on 20 January 1815, the son of William Watts. He went to a private school, and was articled at the age of fifteen as an architect and surveyor but, finding himself unsuited for this profession, supported himself by teaching, chiefly mathematics. He attended lectures at University College, London, and in 1841 graduated BA (London). He was a competent mathematician and a good classical scholar and also had a sound knowledge of French and German (and later of Italian and Swedish). He was also interested in botany and in the fine arts, becoming skilled in sketching plants in watercolours.<br>
<br>As assistant to University College's professor of practical chemistry, George Fownes, from 1846, Watts directed students' laboratory work in the college's new Birkbeck Chemical Laboratory. After Fownes's death in 1849 he continued these duties (until 1857) under Professor Alexander William Williamson. Owing to an incurable impediment in speech he was unable to obtain a professorship, and instead devoted himself to the literature of chemistry. In 1847 he was elected fellow of the Chemical Society. The following year he was engaged by the Cavendish Society to translate and enlarge Leopold Gmelin's classical <span class="italic">Handbuch der Chemie</span>, a work which occupied much of his time until 1872, when the last of its eighteen volumes appeared.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1849 Watts was elected editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span> and in 1860 he also became librarian to the society, holding both posts until his death. On 1 August 1854 he married Sophie, second daughter of Henri Hanhart, a grocer of Mulhouse, Alsace; the couple had eight sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1858 Watts brought out a revised and enlarged second edition of Thomas Graham's <span class="italic">Chemistry</span> and he was also engaged by Longmans to prepare a new edition of Andrew Ure's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Chemistry and Mineralogy</span>. However, he soon decided that Ure's work was so far out of date that he could not revise it satisfactorily and instead began to compile a new <span class="italic">Dictionary of Chemistry and the Allied Branches of other Sciences</span>, assisted by a team of distinguished contributors. This work in five volumes was completed in 1868, but additions were required to keep up with the rapid advances in chemistry, and three supplementary volumes were issued, in 1872, 1875, and 1879&#150;81. Watts's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> contained sound summaries of the facts and theories of chemistry, and was highly commended by his contemporaries.<br>
<br>With H. Bence Jones Watts brought out two editions of Fownes's <span class="italic">Manual of Chemistry</span> between 1868 and 1872; he completed the twelfth edition in 1877. By his revisions Watts almost entirely rewrote the book. He was engaged on the thirteenth edition with W. A. Tilden at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Early in 1871 the Chemical Society decided to print abstracts in its <span class="italic">Journal</span> of all papers on chemistry appearing in full elsewhere. A committee was appointed to superintend the publication of the <span class="italic">Journal</span> and these summaries, but when the scheme proved unworkable, the revision of the abstracts was left entirely to Watts. The abstracts in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> may be regarded as models, and the success of this scheme must be attributed to Watts alone.<br>
<br>In 1866 Watts was elected FRS; on 19 June 1876 he was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100 a year and in 1879 he was elected fellow of the Physical Society. He was also an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society and a life governor of University College, London. He died of heart failure on 30 June 1884 at his home, 151 King Henry's Road, Primrose Hill, South Hampstead, London, after a short illness.<br>
