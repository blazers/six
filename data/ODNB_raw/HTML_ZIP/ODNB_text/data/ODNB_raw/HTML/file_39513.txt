</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gunn,  Neil Miller</span>  (1891&#150;1973), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 8 November 1891 at Dunbeath, Caithness, the seventh of the nine children of James Gunn (1847&#150;1916), fishing boat skipper, and his second wife, Isabella Miller (1855&#150;1926?).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyyears"></a>Education and early years</h2>He was educated at Dunbeath School, where he excelled in English and mathematics but disappointed in history. In his final term a prose piece, &#145;The Sea Storm&#146;, won particular praise, prophesying Gunn's hallmark powers of description of life in northern Scotland. That year, 1904, he flitted to the other end of Scotland, St John's Town of Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire, where he lived with his married elder sister Mary and her husband, a Dr Keiller. There Gunn received private tuition in Latin from the local headmaster, and tuition in poetry, art, and French from an elderly private tutor, J. G. Carter, once an assistant to John Blackie, the nationalist and classical scholar. Carter imparted to Gunn a love of nineteenth-century poets from Shelley to Tennyson, and of Fitzgerald's <span class="roman">Omar Khayyam</span>, and he encouraged an interest in native flora and fauna. By Gunn's reckoning, Carter could not keep pace with his pupil's self-taught mathematics.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1907 Gunn took an exam in Edinburgh for entrance to the civil service. He passed easily. By the summer he was in London, not yet sixteen, working as a clerk in Shepherd's Bush Post Office Savings Bank. His elder brother James, in his mid-twenties, was already a civil servant in the capital, and though Gunn also made friends with Londoners, he became part of an informal but supportive network of young Scottish &eacute;migr&eacute;s. In London the spirit of intellectual enquiry which had been gently awakened in him in Dalry was found again listening to debate at speaker's-corner, and reading Wells and T. H. Huxley. It was in London that he began to think of himself as a socialist. Intellectual life, though, had its limits. In Scotland Gunn had enjoyed athletics, curling, and shinty, and poaching salmon in his much-loved local river, Dunbeath Water. In England he played football for his civil service team in west London and occasionally visited the music-hall and opera in town.<br>
<br>In 1909 Gunn transferred to Edinburgh where he worked for a further two years as a clerk at a tax office. After another successful exam and six weeks' training, on 21 December 1911 he was appointed an officer of the customs and excise. He was based at Inverness where for the next decade he specialized in pensions. This required his covering long distances across northern Scotland. Though later, when he was about forty, he suffered an injury which left him blind in one eye (the accident's cause is to this day obscure), a photograph of Gunn from these earlier days shows him tall (6 feet 1 inch), cigarette on lip, goggles on forehead, and sitting commandingly astride a 500 cc Rudge Multi motorbike, staring determinedly to camera. His job involved assessing claimants by interview, latent material perhaps for the sinister Questioner in his dystopian novel <span class="italic">The Green Isle of the Great Deep</span> (1944). He was also required to act as a locum for excise officers attached to distilleries. It was through this that in 1914 he met Maurice Walsh, an exciseman at Forres, Moray, and later author of <span class="italic">The Quiet Man</span>. They became close friends and encouraged each other to write.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War Gunn's employers did not pressure him into enlisting. Instead, he was stationed at Kinlochleven in Argyll, where, apart from his customs and excise duties, he assisted the Admiralty in issuing mine-evading instructions to ships. Here he began tentatively to write poetry and short fiction, gaining his first publication in a London magazine, <span class="italic">The Apple-Tree</span>, in May 1918. Gunn's mother, having seen four of her sons sign up, had been keen for him to stay at home. The Home Office also preferred that he remained working for the government in Scotland. Two of Gunn's elder brothers were killed in the war, a third died of heart disease while in the army, and one of Gunn's younger brothers, John, was gassed, though he later recovered. His father died in 1916. Nevertheless, Gunn finally signed up in 1918, days before the armistice. He was not required to serve.<br>
<br>By 1920 Gunn was in love with Jessie (Daisy) Dallas Frew (1887/8&#150;1963), the daughter of John Rose Frew, a jeweller. Daisy then worked at her father's shop in Dingwall. With a precipitate stationing to Lancashire in 1921, Gunn married Daisy on 24 March of that year at Wigan register office, but by the end of 1922 they had been relocated and were back in Scotland, at Lybster, Caithness. Finally, in 1923, Gunn became the distillery officer at Glen Mhor distillery, Inverness, where he worked for the next fourteen years. From 1926 they lived in a bungalow they had had built, Larachan. With the stability the job gave him, with its relatively gentle workload and his new house, Gunn was able to write in earnest.<h2>
<a name="Firstwritings"></a>First writings</h2>In 1923 his short stories had been championed by C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid), who published his work in <span class="italic">Scottish Nation</span> and <span class="italic">Northern Review</span> and encouraged Gunn to see his work as part of the modern &#145;Scottish Renaissance&#146;. Gunn's stories also found publication in the <span class="italic">Cornhill</span>: even at this stage his work appealed both to the intelligentsia and to readers humbly in search of a good yarn. By the end of the decade J. B. Salmond's <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> was Gunn's most consistent publisher of his work, taking short stories, one-act plays, and serializing two novels. His first book, <span class="italic">The Grey Coast</span>, was published by Cape in 1926 and, as a tale of emotional claustrophobia at the edge of an agoraphobic landscape, is typical of his fiction of the 1920s. In these stories (many in the short story form) the fey Celticism of Fiona Macleod is both an influence and a subject of interrogation; key characters are intensely introspective to the extent of self-defeat; highland harbours and crofts are in decline. The only releases are a Lawrentian eroticism and glimpses of a delighting sensuality.<br>
<br>Drama was of perennial interest to Gunn. After Maurice Walsh and his wife, Toshon, returned to Ireland in 1922 he would stay with them at least annually, taking advantage of his visits to see performances at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. He was inspired in his fiction by the outpouring of Irish writing from Pearse to Joyce, and Irish drama was an impetus for his plays. Though never an unqualified success, these were performed over the next twenty-five years at every level of Scottish drama, first on BBC radio in 1929, by the Scottish National Players at Glasgow's Lyric Theatre the same year, by amateur actors in the community theatre movement of the 1930s, on wartime radio, and at the Edinburgh festival in 1952. Through drama Gunn became a close friend of the playwright O. H. Mavor, (James Bridie).<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">The Grey Coast</span> Gunn found it difficult to publish a second novel, though a collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Hidden Doors</span>, was issued in 1929 by the Edinburgh independent Porpoise Press. Cape regarded him as a one-novel novelist. After other rejections and the shelving of the allegedly anti-English <span class="italic">The Lost Glen</span>, eventually published in 1932, Gunn returned to Porpoise for the publication of <span class="italic">Morning Tide</span> (1931). With a trading agreement linking it to Faber, Porpoise now had editorial back-up, an entr&eacute;e to the London reviews, and, through Faber's links with Harcourt Brace, better access to America. <span class="italic">Morning Tide</span>, a Book Society choice, was an expansion of an earlier short story about fishermen avoiding disaster at sea with heroism and panache. As so much of Gunn's fiction reworks earlier ideas with new perspectives, it recalls the subject of his prize-winning school essay, written in the first years of the new century. It seems also to offer an alternative to Synge's tragic play <span class="italic">Riders to the Sea</span> (1904), and introduces another characteristic of much of Gunn's succeeding fiction: at the heart of often elegiac stories there is usually an earned optimism, a confidence in the continuity of human stoicism, of ingenuity and affection.<h2>
<a name="Politicalactivitiesandpersonalrelationships"></a>Political activities and personal relationships</h2>Gunn had joined the National Party of Scotland in 1929, and the next five years were spent as a political activist in nationalist politics. Though on the left, he helped negotiate the merger of the NPS with the more right-wing Scottish Party, forming the Scottish National Party in 1934. Grieve was expelled from the new organization as an extremist. This aggravated a breakdown in their friendship which had begun two years earlier. In letters to Gunn, Grieve had argued for the supremacy of poetry as an art form, dismissing the novel in general and Gunn's novels in particular. After fitful correspondence that lasted until the outbreak of the Second World War meaningful communication between them went dead. Gunn's entry into artistic and political life following the success of <span class="italic">Morning Tide</span> and the emergence of the SNP brought him new friends and influential acquaintances. T. S. Eliot visited him in Inverness three times before the war, and Gunn counted as friends or friendly correspondents the writers Catherine Carswell, Naomi Mitchison, Edwin Muir, Nan Shepherd, and the artist Keith Henderson. In the summer of 1934 he also began a secret, lifelong affair with Margaret MacEwen (<i>b</i>. 1913), daughter of the nationalist Sir Alexander MacEwen, and during the war a communist.<br>
<br>Though both Gunn and Daisy came from large families, they were unable to have children. Daisy had successive miscarriages and, fifty years later, in the delirium of the last hours of his life, Gunn mourned a stillborn son. Despite or because of this, one of his achievements in <span class="italic">Morning Tide</span> and several later novels is the sensitive portrayal of a boy's growing up, a theme to which his spare but well-observed dialogue and acute appreciation of the sensual world seem well suited.<h2>
<a name="Laternovels"></a>Later novels</h2>Perhaps remembering his poor performance in history at school, lessons which he later suggested were obsessed with dates and English heroes, Gunn published two historical novels in succession. <span class="italic">Sun Circle</span> (1933) is a novel about a viking raid, and <span class="italic">Butcher's Broom</span> (1934) describes the highland clearances. The latter, in its mixing of social history, polemic, and the recreation of an isolated &#145;primitive&#146; society, suggests that it is not only for his descriptions of fishing communities that Gunn has been compared to Herman Melville. It was not until <span class="italic">Highland River</span> (1937), however, that a more self-conscious novelist emerged. Reorientating flashbacks, the protagonist in philosophical free fall, a subtly ironic portrayal of an intellectual exiled from his community, and a unique use of the third person with past and present tenses, offer this novel as a case study of a human's development from childhood to mature self-consciousness, and reveal a novel of technical virtuosity engaging with large themes. Add to this the novel's meditation on growing up, on the effects of the First World War, and on the very nature of being itself, and <span class="italic">Highland River</span> stands as a substantial contribution to later modernism.<br>
<br>Other, less assured, novels followed. After <span class="italic">Highland River</span>'s success Gunn had resigned his excise job, had already withdrawn from behind-the-scenes politics, bought a boat to sail round the Hebrides&#151;(recounted in <span class="italic">Off in a Boat</span> (1938))&#151;sold Larachan, and in late 1938 settled with Daisy in rented accommodation, Braefarm House near Dingwall. He was now writing for a living, supplementing his income from fiction by journalism on local and national issues, from the fishing industry to Scottish independence. Porpoise had folded, Gunn had been taken on by Faber, and though <span class="italic">Wild Geese Overhead</span> (1939), a novel based largely in Glasgow, and <span class="italic">Second Sight</span> (1940), set in a hunting lodge, were not failures in terms of sales or contemporary reviews, they seem now awkward responses to the author's sense of a general moral disintegration for which metropolitan life was (he seems to have felt) partly to blame. The defensiveness of these, returned to with equally unsatisfying results in <span class="italic">The Drinking Well</span> (1947), <span class="italic">The Shadow</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">The Lost Chart</span> (1949), is not to be found in <span class="italic">The Silver Darlings</span> (1941). This novel describes an infant, Finn, growing up in a Caithness fishing community immediately after the Napoleonic wars. Its synthesis of folklore, folksong, historical detail, episodes of high adventure, acute psychological observation, and symphonic recurrences of intense, almost supernatural experiences, make it a third high point in Gunn's <i>&#339;uvre</i>.<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">The Silver Darlings</span>, <span class="italic">Young Art and Old Hector</span> (1942) adopts a more prosaic aesthetic: the conversations and experiences of the eponymous child and old man are set out in affectionate homage to the wit and warmth of Highland life. In the Scottish tradition of literature evoking children's views of the world, <span class="italic">Young Art</span> looks back to Stevenson's <span class="italic">A Child's Garden of Verses</span> and forward to the earlier poetry of Ian Hamilton Finlay. It was followed immediately by <span class="italic">The Serpent</span> (1943), the story of an atheist's intense relationship with his family and community, and then by the only sequel Gunn ever wrote, <span class="italic">The Green Isle of the Great Deep</span> (1944). In this dystopia Young Art and Old Hector enter, by way of nearly drowning, a Celtic heaven with a difference: it has been organized on ultra-rationalist lines. Controlled by a bureaucracy armed with sophisticated forms of psychological torture, heaven's people are superficial, dutiful, and humourless (this is five years before <span class="italic">Nineteen Eighty-Four</span>). Art and Hector, with the help of one of the few vibrant citizens in this eerie Tir-nan-Og, Mary, finally manage to bring the government of heaven down and help reinstate a fairer one. The allegory finishes deftly with man and boy safely returned to the riverside in real time.<br>
<br>The novel's spirit of reconstruction is paralleled in Gunn's own work on the post-war hospital committee in Scotland, whose report in 1943 is said to have contributed to the formation of the National Health Service. Gunn would later be called upon for other public duty work including the commission of inquiry into crofting conditions, which resulted in the establishment of the Crofters' Commission. In 1948 he was made an honorary doctor of letters by Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">The Green Isle</span> Gunn returned to <span class="italic">Highland River</span>'s interest in the relationship between academics and intellectuals and the communities they attempt to describe or relate to. <span class="italic">The Key of the Chest</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The Silver Bough</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">The Well at the World's End</span> (1951) gently satirize teacherly romanticism while affirming both the individual's and any given community's ability to survive and even triumph in the face of tragedy. Although these philosophical books were received at the time with some bemusement (Edwin Muir's voice being a notable exception), in the last quarter of the twentieth century they began to have a more positive critical reception. In particular, their playfulness and sophisticated sense of irony found better recognition. Gunn's elegiac optimism is also present in his last novels, the suspenseful <span class="italic">Bloodhunt</span> (1952), and the enigmatic <span class="italic">The Other Landscape</span> (1954), both taking as a starting point a tragic death (respectively, murder and death in childbirth) and then envisaging the painful but certain reconstruction of the lives of the survivors. <span class="italic">The Other Landscape</span> was, however, a substantial departure for Gunn. Its interest in the limits of language and human knowledge and, for example, their analogue in the sea, while recalling his youthful fascination with mathematical systems, has some affinity with W. S. Graham's <span class="italic">The Nightfishing</span> (1955).<br>
<br>Gunn's last book was <span class="italic">The Atom of Delight</span> (1956), an essay recounting and analysing incidents in the first two decades of his life. Its comparisons of Western and Far Eastern ideas of self, familiar to a later generation brought up on <span class="italic">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</span>, and its openness to a hyper-material interpretation of consciousness, found it new readers in the 1980s, when it went through two new editions. At the time, however, it had a puzzled reception and this, as well as Gunn's failing energies and increasing ill health, discouraged him from writing further books.<br>
<br>Daisy died in 1963, and Gunn, of cancer, on 15 January 1973 at the Royal Infirmary, Inverness. They were buried in Dingwall cemetery. On a road on the hills above Dingwall, near Braefarm House, there is a memorial to Gunn.<br>
