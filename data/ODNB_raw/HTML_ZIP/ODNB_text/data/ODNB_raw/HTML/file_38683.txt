<span class="headword">Unwin,  (Emma) Jane Catherine  Cobden</span>  (1851&#150;1947), <span class="occ">suffragist and radical</span>, was born on 28 April 1851 at Westbourne Terrace, London, the fourth of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5741/', "Richard Cobden (1804&#150;1865)")</script>, radical politician and statesman, and his wife, Catherine Anne (1815&#150;1877), the youngest daughter of Hugh Williams, timber merchant, of Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire, and his wife, Elinor. After the death of their elder brother in Germany in 1856, Cobden's daughters formed a remarkable sisterhood in late Victorian and Edwardian Britain. The eldest sister, Kate (1844&#150;1916), married Richard Fisher, a Sussex neighbour, who was to become a valuable recruit to the Cobden Club set up in 1866 in honour of their father. Ellen Millicent Ashburner (1848&#150;1914), having married and then divorced (in 1899) the artist Walter Sickert, was to write several novels redolent of her father's life. Jane's younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56224/', "(Julia Sarah) Anne Cobden-Sanderson (1853&#150;1926)")</script>, the wife of the Arts and Crafts bookbinder and printer Thomas J. Cobden-Sanderson, gravitated towards the Independent Labour Party and was to be imprisoned as a suffragette in 1906. Only the short life of Lucy Elizabeth Margaret (1861&#150;1891) was to prove relatively uneventful.<br>
<br>Having grown up in the shadow of a remarkable politician to whom they had been very close, on Cobden's premature death the sisters, and their mother, were left with a keen desire to protect his memory. Jane, educated intermittently by governesses and at small private schools in London, Southport, and Paris, became the most intimately involved in the family manoeuvres which led to the discontinuance of the edition of Cobden's correspondence which his political friends (also in large part the family's financial benefactors) had wished to publish and to its replacement by John Morley's <span class="italic">Life of Cobden</span>, published in 1881. After the death of their mother, the Cobden sisters, living independently in London, found many friendships among their father's political allies, but expanded into an artistic and literary cultural milieu which included the novelist George MacDonald and William and Jane Morris. Also among Jane's friends were several early advocates of women's suffrage, and in 1875 she decided &#145;No more aimless wanderings abroad for me, I shall enter into the Women's Suffrage Campaign and so have a real interest in life&#146;  (diary, Cobden MS 1071). This resolution took some years to mature, but from 1880, after several more extensive journeys abroad, especially to Algiers, Jane Cobden played an active role in women's Liberal politics, especially promoting women's suffrage within the Women's Liberal Federation. In 1888 she supported the majority of members of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, who favoured continued agitation through the Liberal Party, and as a founder member of the Women's Suffrage League she and Lady Sandhurst were the first women elected to the new London county council in 1889. Prematurely white-haired, quietly dressed, but striking in appearance, Jane sat for Bow and Bromley, where George Lansbury had ably managed her election. However, the legality of her position was questioned in a series of actions brought by Walter de Souza, with the result that, while she continued to serve on the council until 1892, she faced financial penalties and was not able to vote at its meetings; only in 1907 would women acquire full rights in local government.<br>
<br>Jane Cobden remained active in the suffrage cause (she represented the Women's Franchise League at the World Congress of Representative Women in Chicago in 1893), but she was never a single-issue politician. In the 1880s she had also taken up with enthusiasm the cause of Irish home rule. She visited Ireland several times, most prominently in 1887 as part of the English women's mission to Ireland, and she lectured extensively in England for the Home Rule Union. She also took up the claims and supported the families of many prisoners and evicted tenants in Ireland, the &#145;victims&#146; of English misgovernment. Many of her father's friends had become Unionists, but one of them, Thomas Bayley Potter, warmly approved her conduct, for &#145;You are true to the living and just instincts of your father. &hellip; You know your father's heart better than John Bright does&#146;  (Potter to Jane Cobden, 27 Oct 1887, Cobden MS 1065).<br>
<br>Like many women's activists at this period, Jane Cobden had regarded marriage as secondary to a fulfilling career, but on 9 February 1892, at the relatively late age of forty-one, she became the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47454/', "Thomas Fisher Unwin (1848&#150;1935)")</script>, a leading avant-garde publisher (at this time he published Conrad, Ibsen, Somerset Maugham, Nietzsche, and Olive Schreiner) and keen alpinist. Their marriage was one of genuine affection and devotion, even if on occasion The Jane, as she was known at the press, exercised an intrusive interest in its work. With Unwin, too, she was ready to take up a variety of causes, including international arbitration, Congo reform, and the rights of native peoples, and during the South African War she acted as secretary to the women's section of the pro-Boer South African Conciliation Committee. Most notably, ever anxious to advance her father's political principles, in 1903 she took up the defence of free trade against Chamberlain's tariff reform crusade, coining the term the &#145;hungry forties&#146; and vindicating it in an evocative and brilliantly successful tract of that title. This, together with other numerous contributions from the Fisher Unwin press, did much to turn free trade into a progressive Edwardian cause. Fostered by the Fisher Unwins, the cult of Cobden burgeoned in his centenary year (1904), with his old Sussex home, Dunford House, becoming a much-visited &#145;shrine&#146;. Jane Cobden Unwin also took a keen interest in the neighbouring village of Heyshott, especially its working men's Cobden Club, which she had helped found in 1879. In 1913 she published <span class="italic">The Land Hunger: Life under Monopoly</span>, a minor addition to the literature of Edwardian land reform, but one which did not repeat the success of its predecessor; significantly, her sister Anne (there was some jealousy between them) had preferred to enlist their father's memory on the side of land nationalization.<br>
<br>Jane Cobden Unwin was a woman of sentiment and enthusiasm who took up (and sometimes speedily dropped) causes with a fire which brooked no opposition. In the years immediately before the First World War she acted on behalf of the wives and children of strikers in east London and Dublin as well as appealing on behalf of starving Arab women and children in Tripoli. She also acted as secretary of the Emma Cons memorial committee (Cons had also served on the LCC), its funds ultimately going to the Old Vic, originally set up by Cons as a coffee music-hall but turned into a theatre of national repute by Cons's niece, Lilian Baylis. During the First World War, Jane's strong interest in South Africa revived, and within the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society she became an inconveniently outspoken opponent of the segregation policy embodied in the <span class="roman">Native Land Act</span> of 1913. After the war she also took up with great personal generosity the cause of the victims of the Black and Tans, remaining a leading British sympathizer with the cause of Irish freedom.<br>
<br>Jane Cobden Unwin's idealism also led to her presenting Cobden's former home to the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1919, hoping thereby to inspire a new generation with her passions; she was, however, speedily disappointed, Beatrice Webb recording &#145;the poor lady, because she cannot ensure that the use of the place corresponds to her dreams, is regretting the gift&#146;  (B. Webb, diary, 2 May 1923); in 1923 the school sold Dunford back to the Fisher Unwins, although Jane remained a governor of the LSE until 1928. Dunford House instead now became a significant centre for international meetings devoted to the Cobdenite causes of free trade, peace, and goodwill, with a series of conferences and lectures, enlisting the help of valuable recruits such as F. W. Hirst and the American internationalist N. M. Butler. Jane also spent much time obsessively arranging and rearranging Cobden's papers before gradually and selectively depositing them in the British Museum. Following Fisher Unwin's death in 1935, Jane Cobden Unwin, now in her eighties, led an increasingly solitary life at her home, Oatscroft, near Dunford House, but occasionally wrote to the press on Cobdenite points. She died at Whitehanger Nursing Home in Fenhurst, Surrey, on 7 July 1947.<br>
