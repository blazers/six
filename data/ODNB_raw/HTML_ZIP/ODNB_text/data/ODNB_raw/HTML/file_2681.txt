<span class="headword">Blore,  Thomas</span>  (1764&#150;1818), <span class="occ">county historian</span>, was born in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, on 1 December 1764, the son of John Blore and his wife, Elizabeth, and educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Ashbourne. He married Margaret (1761&#150;1791), daughter of John and Martha Blore, also of Ashbourne, on 16 July 1786. A son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2679/', "Edward Blore")</script>, antiquarian artist and architect, was born in Derby on 13 September 1787, but the couple later became estranged. Having first been employed as a solicitor in Derby, Blore went to Hopton Hall, Derbyshire, as agent to the owner, Philip Gell (<i>d</i>. 1795). After Gell's death, Blore married his widow, Dorothy, daughter of William Milnes of Chesterfield, in May 1798, and moved to London. The relationship was acrimonious and the couple separated formally in April 1802. Dorothy Blore died in April 1808. Blore entered the Middle Temple, but was never called to the bar.<br>
<br>From at least 1791 Blore was collecting materials for his intended history of Derbyshire. To encourage subscribers he published in that year his &#145;Proposals&#146; and three examples of his work: histories of South Wingfield Manor and Manor House, Alderwasley, and Breadsall Priory. In the course of his researches he corresponded extensively with other local antiquaries, such as Daniel Dakeyne of Holt House, Darley Dale.<br>
<br>Blore transferred his attention to Hertfordshire while living at Benwick Hall, near Hertford, and collected historical notes which formed the nucleus of Robert Clutterbuck's history of the county, eventually published between 1815 and 1827. He then moved successively to Mansfield Woodhouse in Nottinghamshire; Burr House, near Bakewell, Derbyshire; Manton in Rutland; and Stamford in Lincolnshire. The pattern of ambitious plans partially realized, first seen in Derbyshire, was repeated in Rutland, for which only the second part of the first volume of Blore's projected <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the County of Rutland</span> was published in 1811. For a short period he edited <span class="italic">Drakard's Stamford News</span> and he also produced an account of Stamford's charitable foundations in 1813, and a guide to Burghley House and its collections in 1815.<br>
<br>Thomas Blore died in London on 10 November 1818, and his memorial stone in Paddington church recorded that his &#145;days were embittered and [his] life was shortened by intense application&#146;. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and all his historical writings are characterized by thoroughness and careful detail, a feature recognized by later antiquaries such as Llewellynn Jewitt (1816&#150;1886), who regretted that Blore's projects had met with &#145;a lack of proper encouragement&#146;. The bulk of Blore's papers are now in Cambridge University Library, although some survive in the Dakeyne and Gell collections in Derbyshire Record Office.<br>
