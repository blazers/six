<span class="headword">Giffard,  John</span>  (1745&#150;1819), <span class="occ">politician and newspaper editor</span>, was born on 14 February 1745 in Dublin, the son of John Giffard (<i>d</i>. 1746) of Wotton and Great Torrington, Devon, and his wife, Dorcas, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murphy, of Oulartleigh, co. Wexford, widow of Francis Robinson of Dublin. Though descended on his mother's side from the ancient Irish family the McMorroughs, and connected on his father's to the Giffards of Devon, Giffard's upbringing was decidedly modest. Educated, it was alleged, as a charity pupil at the famous Blue Coat Hospital in Dublin, he qualified as an apothecary in London, and he was made a freeman of the Apothecaries' Guild in Dublin in 1768. A year later, in June 1769, he married Sarah Morton (1750&#150;1827), an heir of Ballynaclash, co. Wexford, and the first of their six children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10646/', "Ambrose Hardinge Giffard")</script>, was born in 1771.<br>
<br>Giffard was elected, as a representative of the Apothecaries' Guild, to the common council of Dublin corporation in 1774. His political orientation in the 1770s was towards opposition; in 1778 the first company of Dublin Volunteers was formed at his house, and in 1779 he joined with Napper Tandy and John Binns in advocating &#145;free trade&#146;. However, political instinct and self-interest pulled him in the opposite direction, and the early 1780s were to witness his transformation into a conservative activist. His role in reporting the proceedings of the Irish parliament that resulted in the publication of the first volume of the <span class="italic">Parliamentary Register</span> (1782) attracted the notice of the Irish administration, and he was already a &#145;Castle scribbler&#146;  (Inglis, 58) when he publicly challenged the legality of an aggregate meeting convened in Dublin on 21 June 1784 to launch a campaign for parliamentary reform. His presence together with the attorney-general, John Fitzgibbon, when he embarked on a similar action three months later, emphasized his usefulness to the Dublin Castle authorities, and he confirmed his value during the mid-1780s by, among other services, reporting debates in the House of Commons in 1787. Already the beneficiary of a position in the customs service and a secret service pension of &pound;300, Giffard's star rose further when Dublin Castle helped him secure the lease on the city's oldest newspaper, <span class="italic">Faulkner's Dublin Journal</span>, in 1788.<br>
<br>Dublin Castle's expectation was that Giffard would turn the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span> into a propaganda mouthpiece, and he did not disappoint. He used the paper and his membership of the growing &#145;castle party&#146; on the common council to promote the administration's position during the late 1780s and early 1790s on such issues as the regency, the lord mayoralty dispute, the French Revolution, and Catholic relief. His egregious manner and assertive conservatism precipitated an unseemly altercation in 1790 with John Philpot Curran, but Giffard was unrepentant. Intolerant of those of opposite views and devoted to the maintenance of the political <i>status quo</i>, he was a member of the corporation committee that drafted the famous clarion call to protestants to rally to maintain &#145;protestant ascendancy&#146; in January 1792. He further demonstrated his ardent conservatism by passing information from Thomas Collins, the United Irish spy, to Dublin Castle and by becoming a captain in the Dublin militia. As sheriff of Dublin in 1793&#150;4 he zealously prosecuted radicals and, among other actions, conducted the raid upon Tailors' Hall in May 1794 that brought the open phase of the United Irishmen to a close. His partiality and arrogant righteousness made him a hate figure in liberal circles and earned him the nickname the Dog in Office. Giffard resorted to the courts to protect his name, but despite his successful prosecution of the editor of the <span class="italic">Dublin Morning Post</span> in 1794 the sobriquet stuck. Indeed, its use by a rival newspaper in 1795 resulted in an assault by Giffard for which he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, though high-level intervention secured his early release.<br>
<br>Just prior to this Giffard's career as a newspaper editor appeared finished when the lord lieutenant, Earl Fitzwilliam, &#145;dismissed&#146; him and the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>  (Inglis, 61). The experience did nothing to temper his ultra-protestant activities, for following his restoration to favour on Fitzwilliam's recall he co-ordinated Dublin corporation's petition against Catholic emancipation and he was among the first members of the Orange order in the capital when a lodge was established there in 1797. Widely perceived in radical circles as a rabid bigot, he featured on several assassination lists in the run-up to the 1798 rising. He survived the rising unscathed but the death of his son William and his nephew Daniel Frederick Ryan left a deep mark. Convinced that protestant ascendancy and the British connection could be maintained only if Britain and Ireland were bound in a legislative union, he defied his colleagues in the Orange order and on Dublin corporation to support the measure. His political life thereafter was devoted to the twin causes of protestant ascendancy and the Union. To this end he sought at every opportunity to promote loyalty to the Hanoverian monarchy in Ireland, to popularize the Union, and, as befitted a deputy grand master of the Orange order, to oppose the enhancement of the position of Catholics. His procrustean commitment to the maintenance of protestant ascendancy meant relations with the Irish executive were often difficult. The earl of Hardwicke dismissed him from his place as accountant-general of the customs in 1805, but he was restored by the duke of Richmond, and successive tory administrations kept him on board until 1816 when he severed his connection with the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>. Unable to accept that his brand of ultra-conservatism was no longer respectable, Giffard remained politically active in the cause he had done so much to promote until his death on 5 May 1819.<br>
