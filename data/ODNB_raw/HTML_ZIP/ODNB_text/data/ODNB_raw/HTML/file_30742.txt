<span class="headword">Abercrombie,  Michael</span>  (1912&#150;1979), <span class="occ">biologist</span>, was born at The Gallows, Ryton, Dymock, Gloucestershire, on 14 August 1912, the third son in the family of three sons and a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30321/', "Lascelles Abercrombie (1881&#150;1938)")</script>, poet and critic, and his wife, Catherine (1881&#150;1968), daughter of Owen Gwatkin, surgeon, of Grange-over-Sands. The Abercrombies were a distinguished family for, in addition to Lascelles, Michael counted among his uncles <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30322/', "Sir (Leslie) Patrick Abercrombie")</script>, a pioneer of town planning, Rudolph (Rody), physician and field naturalist, and Charles, a businessman. Michael's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50766/', "David Abercrombie")</script> became a professor of phonetics in the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Abercrombie attended Liverpool College, and then from 1922 went to Leeds grammar school, proceeding as top Hastings scholar to Queen's College, Oxford, in 1931. At Oxford he read zoology under the tuition of Gavin de Beer. De Beer arranged for him to work for a period at the Strangeways Research Laboratory in Cambridge under C. H. Waddington with whom he began to study the early development of the domestic chicken by experimental methods, giving particular attention to the signals involved in laying down the body plan. He completed this work at the school of pathology in Oxford, where he shared a room with his friend and contemporary Peter Medawar. The work gained him a first-class honours degree in 1934. He could have extended his studies for a PhD but, at the time, it was not fashionable in Oxford to do so. During this period Abercrombie took an active part in the extensive programme of research on the degeneration of peripheral nerves then in progress in the zoology laboratories under the direction of J. Z. Young.<br>
<br>In 1938 Abercrombie lectured in the zoology department at Birmingham University, while concurrently holding a research fellowship at Queen's College, Oxford. Here he met and (on 17 July 1939) married Minnie Louie (Jane) Johnson (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), a fellow zoology lecturer three years his senior. She was the daughter of Stanley Johnson, an electrical engineer. He moved to Birmingham on a Beit memorial fellowship in 1940 and then became a lecturer in 1945. His most important enterprise at this time was to inaugurate a series of biological texts entitled <span class="roman">New Biology</span>, published by Penguin Books, aimed at bringing advanced biology in an intelligible form to sixth formers and first-year biology students. Unfortunately both Abercrombies quarrelled, as had many others, with Lancelot Hogben, Birmingham's head of zoology. Thus in 1946 Abercrombie took a lectureship in the department of anatomy in University College, London, working under his old tutor, Gavin de Beer, the head of the embryology sub-department. He was reader in embryology from 1950 to 1959.<br>
<br>It was here that Abercrombie began the research which made his international reputation, for it was his belief (not shared by de Beer) that embryological problems could be studied in the processes of wound repair, as they might occur in adult animals. His interest in wound healing led him to study cell movement. He was a pioneer in the study of the cellular interactions and cell movement in tissue culture, making particular use of time-lapse cinematography which enabled the visualization of the cells' activities to be greatly speeded up. He juxtaposed two actively growing cultures of fibroblasts&#151;connective tissue cells&#151;which showed that, when the cells migrating outwards from them came into contact with cells from the neighbouring piece of tissue, cell movement ceased. The discovery of this phenomenon, contact inhibition&#151;much less pronounced in cancerous cells than in normal&#151;led to his election to the Royal Society in 1958. It was the basis of his claim to become, first, titular professor of embryology at University College (1959&#150;62) and then Jodrell professor of zoology and comparative anatomy (1962&#150;70). In 1962 he also spent eight months in the Carnegie Institute of Embryology in Washington.<br>
<br>Abercrombie had strongly left-wing opinions. He joined the Communist Party in 1932, but in due course the same humanity and sense of justice that had caused him to join the party caused him to leave it. His last appointment (1970&#150;79) was to succeed Dame Honor B. Fell as the head of the Strangeways Research Laboratory in Cambridge, an appointment whose administrative obligations he coped with as well as a man could who derived no pleasure whatsoever from the exercise of power. He was firm, though, and looked after the interests of his staff. At the same time he was a fellow of Clare Hall.<br>
<br>When the verdict of the market place brought &#145;new biology&#146; to an end Abercrombie and his wife wrote and published a <span class="italic">Dictionary of Biology</span> (with C. J. Hickman, 1950), a fine example of concision and clear writing. Abercrombie's work on contact inhibition continued and provided important insights on the control of cell movement. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Uppsala University and won the Ernst Bertner award for cancer research. He died at his home, 2 Bridge Lane, Little Shelford, Cambridge, on 28 May 1979.<br>
