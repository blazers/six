<span class="headword">MacBrayne,  David</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1817, <em>d.</em> 1907), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was baptized on 25 December 1817 in the Barony parish of Glasgow, the son of David MacBrayne, registrar of births in the Barony parish, and Elizabeth Stevenson Burns, daughter of the Revd Dr John Burns of the Barony Church. After initial training as a typefounder, he joined a shipping firm to train as a clerk. This was probably in the office of his uncles, George and James Burns, who in 1830 had established the City of Glasgow Steam Packet Company, trading between Glasgow, Liverpool, Belfast, and Londonderry. The Burns's partners in this were two Liverpool Scots, David and Charles MacIver; it was George Burns and David MacIver who joined with Samuel Cunard as founding partners of what became the Cunard Line.<br>
<br>In developing their Scottish business G. and J. Burns acquired the Castle Line in 1845, a west highland service. However, in 1848 they sold it to a partnership of their shipping clerk, David Hutcheson, his brother Alexander, and their young nephew David MacBrayne. The new company was operated as David and Alexander Hutcheson &amp; Co., with MacBrayne as a junior partner. This company was early into the competition to open up access to the western highlands and islands, where the advent of the steamer offered the prospect of developing regular services for freight and passengers. Another potential market, in the tourist trade, was simultaneously emerging. Queen Victoria had travelled by track boat through the Crinan Canal in 1847, then onward by steamer via Loch Linnhe to Fort William, and through the Caledonian Canal to Inverness. The &#145;royal route&#146; through the wild splendour of the Western Isles and highlands had been pioneered, and David MacBrayne and his partners were quick to develop it, initially with second-hand tonnage. New purpose-built vessels quickly followed, the first being the <i>Iona</i> in 1855. This introduced Hutchesons' &#145;crack&#146; steamers offering a new style of service combining speed, regularity, comfort, and economy, all under the watchful eye of David MacBrayne, who was responsible for the supervision of the ships and their accommodation. This formula brought them success during thirty years of partnership from 1848 to 1878, during which time the Hutchesons and MacBrayne developed a fleet of fifteen steamers, competing vigorously with the railway ones. The Hutchesons retired between 1876 and 1878 leaving MacBrayne as sole proprietor of his renamed David MacBrayne &amp; Co.<br>
<br>This was the prelude to ten years of vigorous expansion, even though MacBrayne was in his sixties. Ten new vessels were added to make MacBrayne's the pre-eminent service to the islands and highlands. He also skilfully captured a large part of the seasonal tourist trade by developing a variety of daily tours, and longer excursions for which he wrote and published a full-coloured guide in 1878. By the end of the 1880s he operated 28 ships employing 750 men afloat and 700 onshore. This earned the company the famous tag:<blockquote>
<div>The earth it is the Lord's and all that it contains,<br>
</div>
<div>Except the Western Isles and they are all MacBraynes.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Loyalty was a strong feature of the company, most of his men having twenty-five years' or more service with him. His red-funnelled vessels developed a high reputation under his careful and detailed administration.David MacBrayne was totally absorbed by his shipping business, and did not marry until 1860. His wife, Robina Eckford Robertson, was the daughter of an Edinburgh banker, Lawrence Robertson. They had two sons and a daughter. The sons, David Hope MacBrayne and Lawrence MacBrayne, joined their widowed father as partners in 1902, when he was already in ill health. David MacBrayne finally withdrew from active business in 1905, the partnership converting to a limited company with the elder son, David, as chairman and managing director. Even then David MacBrayne kept in constant touch with the affairs of the business, which had been his life for nearly sixty years. He had had little time for, or interest in, other commitments, though he served dutifully on the Clyde Navigation Trust in the 1860s, and as a JP for Glasgow. He died at his home, 11 Park Circus Place, Glasgow, on 26 January 1907. At his death, his name was synonymous with shipping services to the highlands and the western and northern isles. His sons actively developed the business bearing his name, which was subsequently absorbed into a larger conglomerate.<br>
