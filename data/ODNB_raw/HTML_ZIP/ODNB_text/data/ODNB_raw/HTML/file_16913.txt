<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lockwood, Sir  Frank</span>  (1846&#150;1897), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, the second son of Charles Day Lockwood, stone quarrier at Levitt Hagg, near Doncaster, was born at Doncaster on 15 July 1846. In 1860 the family moved to Manchester, and in 1863 Lockwood entered the grammar school (having been previously at a private school at Edenbridge) under Mr Walker, afterwards headmaster of St Paul's School. In October 1865 he proceeded to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took a pass degree in 1869. In 1869, having abandoned the idea of ordination, he entered Lincoln's Inn and he was called to the bar in January 1872. In 1872 he briefly joined the Kendals acting troupe as Daniel Macpherson. He then joined the old midland circuit, and attended sessions at Bradford, Leeds, and other places. During his early days at the bar the habit of drawing he had learned from his father grew upon him, and his rapid sketching in court of judges, witnesses, and litigants gave him occupation and secured him notice. For some of these early sketches he appears to have found a market; but in later life, though he still continued to sketch, he tossed them carelessly away. In September 1874 he married Julia, daughter of Salis Schwabe of Glyn Garth, Anglesey. His practice steadily increased, and from 1879, when, at the request of the presiding judge, he defended the burglar and murderer, Charles Peace, his name was always prominent. He took silk in 1882.<br>
<br>In politics Lockwood was a Liberal. His first attempt to get into parliament, at King's Lynn, was unsuccessful, as also was his first contest at York in November 1883, when, however, he was beaten by twenty-one votes only. In October 1884 he became recorder of Sheffield, and in November 1885 he and his great friend Alfred Pease were elected for York, which city he continued to represent until his death. From 1885 to 1895 Lockwood led a very busy life both professionally and socially.<blockquote>His tall powerful frame, his fine head crowned with picturesque premature white hair, his handsome healthy face, with its sunshine of genial, not vapid good nature, made him notable everywhere. So powerful was this personality that his entrance into a room seemed to change the whole complexion of the company, and I often fancied that he could dispel a London fog by his presence. (Letter of Lord Rosebery, quoted in Birrell, 201)</blockquote>In the Commons, though he took no active part in debate, Lockwood was a great figure, and his sketches depicting the occasional humours of that assembly were in much demand. During the vacation of 1894 Rosebery, to whom Lockwood was warmly attached, preferred Lockwood to R. B. Haldane for the solicitor-generalship when Sir Robert Reid became attorney-general. Lockwood was knighted on 20 November 1894. As solicitor-general, Lockwood played a central part in the prosecution of Oscar Wilde in 1895. The jury failed to reach a verdict in Wilde's first trial, and Lockwood himself led for the prosecution in the second. When Timothy Healy urged Lockwood not to proceed with the prosecution he replied &#145;I would not but for the abominable rumours against Rosebery&#146;  (cited in Ellman, 437). Lockwood was awkwardly placed personally in the affair, for it was his nephew by marriage Maurice Schwabe who had introduced Wilde to Alfred Taylor, the homosexual who procured rent boys for Wilde. Lockwood's final speech of prosecution, on 25 May, was a powerful indictment that helped secure the guilty verdict that imprisoned Wilde and removed the threat of further allegations being made against Rosebery. The election of 1895 restored Lord Salisbury to power, but owing to a difficulty about the scale of his successor's remuneration, Lockwood nominally remained solicitor-general until August 1895, when R. B. Finlay succeeded him. In the vacation of 1896 he accompanied Charles, Lord Russell of Killowen, the lord chief justice of England, to the United States of America. About May 1897 he became depressed, and convinced of his impending death, which exacerbated his depression. He had no other condition diagnosed. He caught influenza and died, aged fifty-one, at his house, 26 Lennox Gardens, Pont Street, Chelsea, on Sunday 19 December 1897. His wife and their two daughters survived him.<br>
<br>Lockwood made no pretensions to be considered a learned lawyer, nor was he a consummate advocate; but his sound sense, ready wit, good feeling, and sympathetic nature, set off as these qualities were by a commanding presence and good voice, placed him in the front ranks of the bar, and easily secured him a large business. Both outside and inside his profession he enjoyed a large and deserved popularity. He drew frequently for <span class="italic">Punch</span> and some of his sketches were published in <span class="italic">The Frank Lockwood Sketch Book</span> (1898); his lecture <span class="italic">The Law and Lawyers of Pickwick</span> was published in 1894. He had the unusual Victorian distinction of giving his name to a British island, Frank Lockwood's Island, off Mull. There are a memorial window and a tablet in York Cathedral.<br>
