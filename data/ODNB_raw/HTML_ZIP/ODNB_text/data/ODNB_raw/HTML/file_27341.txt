<span class="headword">Thornbury,  (George) Walter</span>  (1828&#150;1876), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in London on 13 November 1828, the son of George Thornbury (1795&#150;1873), solicitor, of 16 Chancery Lane, and his wife, Jennet Ann. He was educated at Cheam, Surrey, by the rector, Barton Bouchier, who was the husband of his father's sister, Mary. His parents had hoped that he would enter the church, but Thornbury wanted to be an artist, and spent some time at the academy of James Mathews Leigh. By the age of seventeen he had published topographical and antiquarian papers in Felix Farley's <span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span>, and ultimately decided to be a writer.<br>
<br>Thornbury was living in London by 1851, and became a regular contributor to many other periodicals, including <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, <span class="italic">Ainsworth's</span>, <span class="italic">Welcome Guest</span>, <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>, and <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>. He was a prolific writer, but not meticulous in his habits; one friend spoke fondly of his &#145;disastrously bad hand. The prevailing impression in your mind was that not ink, but a succession of small bomb-shells had been discharged from poor Walter's pen, and that these petards had exploded on the paper&#146;  (Sala, 1.276&#150;7). Thornbury was also a frequent contributor to the later volumes of Dickens's <span class="italic">Household Words</span>, and became one of a group of journalists&#151;including G. A. Sala, Percy Fitzgerald, and Edmund Yates&#151;commonly referred to at the time as Dickens's &#145;young men&#146;  (Sala, 1.77, 94). Many of Thornbury's articles dealt with geographical and topographical themes, and he travelled widely in search of material for the journal&#151;to the United States and Palestine, the Iberian peninsula and Turkey. His articles on Spain printed in <span class="italic">Household Words</span> were later collected and reprinted as <span class="italic">Life in Spain: Past and Present</span> (2 vols., 1859). His contributions to Dickens's second periodical, <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, consisted of two more extended series. &#145;Old stories retold&#146;, fifty-three articles running from 20 October 1866 to 18 July 1868, recounted events in recent history, and often dealt with crimes and criminal proceedings. The content and tone of some of these articles worried Dickens, as he began to feel that Thornbury was &#145;rather given to horrors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 11.371). He rejected one article, feeling that its detailing of criminal acts was &#145;not wholesome for a large audience&#146; and &#145;scarcely justifiable &hellip; as claiming to be a piece of literature&#146;  (ibid., 11.346&#150;7). But Dickens valued Thornbury as a contributor, and interested himself in his reprinted collections as well, cautioning him away from &#145;too many murders&#146;  (ibid., 11.394). Thornbury's later series of thirty-one articles on the safer topic of travel around Britain was instigated at Dickens's suggestion and was printed in <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> between 12 December 1868 and 27 November 1869 under the title &#145;As the crow flies&#146;. When Thornbury reprinted the series in two volumes in 1870 as <span class="italic">A Tour Round England</span>, he dedicated it with permission to Dickens. Throughout their association Dickens demonstrated regard for Thornbury and his writing, remarking in a letter in 1866 that &#145;For some years I have had so much pleasure in reading you, that I can honestly warrant myself &#147;a good audience&#148;&#146;  (ibid., 11.245&#150;6).<br>
<br>All the while Thornbury was engaged in art criticism; he was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>. His first contributions in this vein to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> were reprinted as <span class="italic">The Courts of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park</span> (1851). But his most important publication was his <span class="italic">Life of J. M. W. Turner</span> (2 vols., 1861), based on original letters and papers. It was written under the supervision of John Ruskin, a situation which Thornbury likened to &#145;very much like working bareheaded under a tropical sun!&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In the same year he also produced <span class="italic">British Artists, from Hogarth to Turner: a Series of Biographical Sketches</span> (1861). His other writings were varied in style and subject matter, including translations such as <span class="italic">Pierre Dupont's Legend of the Wandering Jew</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">The Fables of La Fontaine</span> (1867), and historical works such as <span class="italic">Shakespeare's England</span> (1856). His <span class="italic">Haunted London</span> (1865) was &#145;a huge book, full of most curious matter&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 829), where his slightly macabre interests seemed more acceptable than in his purely historical writing. His collections of poetry were generally undistinguished, although one poem from <span class="italic">Songs of the Cavaliers and Roundheads</span> (1857), &#145;The jester's sermon&#146;, is occasionally still anthologized, and sections of its catalogue of follies remain quotable, such as: &#145;The fool that eats till he is sick must fast till he is well&#146;. Thornbury was also a novelist, although his fiction was less highly regarded than his other work. <span class="italic">True as Steel</span> (1863) was based on Goethe's <span class="italic">G&ouml;tz von Berlichingen</span>, and <span class="italic">Wildfire</span> (1864) was an expansion of a sketch by Diderot, and dealt with the French Revolution. His best-known novel at the time was probably <span class="italic">Greatheart</span> (1866), the eponymous hero of which was modelled on John Douglas Cook, the temperamental editor of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, an identification which &#145;got its author into some trouble&#146;  (Escott, 233).<br>
<br>On 7 October 1873 Thornbury married Harriett, the daughter of William Furmedge. They had known each other for some time&#151;Dickens had teased him about their relationship in a letter in 1868 referring to &#145;the specially gentle and beautiful face&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 12.210). Thornbury was afflicted with mental illness during his last years, and he died on 11 June 1876 at the Camberwell House Lunatic Asylum, Peckham Road, London from, as his death certificate records, &#145;exhaustion from acute mania&#146;. He was buried on 13 June at Nunhead cemetery, London, survived by his wife and three young sons. The second volume of his popular descriptive history of London, entitled <span class="italic">Old and New London</span>, had appeared just before his death. The series was completed in four additional volumes by Edward Walford.<br>
