<span class="headword">Tyrrell,  David Arthur John</span>  (1925&#150;2005), <span class="occ">virologist</span>, was born at Kaombe, Salcombe Road, Ashford, Middlesex, on 19 June 1925, the elder son of Sidney Charles Tyrrell, an accountant who had fought in the First World War, and his wife, Agnes Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blewett, a schoolteacher specializing in French and mathematics, who subsequently gave up her career to care for her family. Tyrrell had a gift for languages, later speaking French fluently as well as German. At primary school he was somewhat &#145;dreamy, forgetful and untidy&#146;  (Kerr and Taylor-Robinson, 352) but he excelled at his grammar school in Ashford, where he came top of his class. During the Second World War the family moved to Sheffield, where Tyrrell was a pupil at King Edward VII School, excelling not only at science subjects, but also at German and music. Although he had to drop music this remained a major interest throughout his life.<br>
<br>Tyrrell contemplated teaching but was dissuaded by some aspects of his own school, particularly the attitude of some of his teachers. Stimulated by a family friend who was a general practitioner and an increasing interest in science, he embarked on a career in medicine, starting in the medical school of Sheffield University, where he came under the influence of Charles Stuart-Harris, who subsequently had a major role in Tyrrell's career. After qualifying Tyrrell was encouraged to become involved in clinical research, particularly relating to infectious diseases. He met his wife, (Betty) Moyra Wylie, a general practitioner, while investigating an outbreak of poliomyelitis. She was the daughter of John Wylie, also a medical practitioner. They married at the parish church in Woodlands, Yorkshire, on 15 April 1950, and had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>The defining experience in Tyrrell's career was being appointed as a research assistant at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. There he gained experience in research methodology and an insight into the interaction between viruses, cells, and mechanisms of viral interference. Research departments in the USA were generally less formal than in the UK and this enabled Tyrrell to rub shoulders with eminent basic scientists who were able to fertilize his innate curiosity and inquiring mind. He especially enjoyed the interaction between those trained in clinical medicine, like himself, and those with experience in basic sciences. Throughout his career Tyrrell had the knack of bridging the divide between clinical and basic research. Informality, combined with the highest scientific standards, was of benefit to numerous younger research workers who either trained with him directly or who sought his advice during their careers.<br>
<br>In 1954 Tyrrell returned to Sheffield to work in the Virus Research Laboratory, but three years later Sir Harold Himsworth, secretary of the Medical Research Council (MRC) invited him to join the MRC's Common Cold Unit (CCU) in Salisbury, Wiltshire, to work on the common cold virus that hitherto had not been isolated. The research was carried out in the Harvard Hospital, originally funded by the American Red Cross to deal with war-time epidemics of infectious diseases. Subsequently, the prefabricated buildings were found to be ideal for housing and isolating volunteers for experimental work on the common cold. Tyrrell used the volunteers for studying the transmission and some aspects of the pathogenesis of common cold viruses, growing viruses (later designated rhinoviruses) in cell cultures in test tubes. His success resulted from his unique and ingenious but essentially simple idea that if cultures were not only oxygenated but also incubated, not at the conventional temperature of 35&#150;7&deg;C, but at 33&deg;C, rhinoviruses could be readily cultivated. Indeed, using himself as an experimental model, Tyrrell showed that nasal temperature was a few degrees lower than body temperature.<br>
<br>Tyrrell then extended his work with cell cultures by collaborating with a Swedish ear, nose, and throat specialist, Bertil Hoorn, who had developed an organ culture system which was more physiologically akin to the natural condition than the <i>in vitro</i> cell culture system. Thus when fetal ciliated trachea and nasal epithelium were inoculated, if infected the cilia would stop beating after a few days. This technique resulted in the identification not only of more hitherto uncultivatable rhinoviruses, but also of a new group of human viruses, the corona viruses, which were shown to induce respiratory infections (SARS being an example). To identify these viruses elegant electronmicroscopy was carried out in conjunction with June Almeida at St Thomas's Hospital medical school. The discovery of the rhinoviruses provided Tyrrell with a worldwide reputation. His volunteer studies became renowned and many of his researchers returned to the Harvard Hospital regularly, often during holidays. By the time of his death well over 100 rhinovirus types had been identified but since they all differ from one another antigenically, vaccination against the common cold was considered unrealistic.<br>
<br>In 1967 Tyrrell was appointed to head the division of communicable diseases at the MRC's Clinical Research Centre at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, London. Although by 1970 he was the centre's deputy director he continued to visit and direct research at the CCU, covering such areas as gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in children, as well as identifying as many as possible of the causes of febrile convulsions in infants and children. In 1985, however, the MRC decided to close the Clinical Research Centre and Tyrrell returned to work full-time at the CCU. Together with John Pattison and Mary Anderson, then at University College, London, Tyrrell directed studies on adult volunteers relating to the pathogenesis of parvovirus B19. This virus had been established to be the cause of sickle cell crises in patients with chronic haemolytic anaemia. The virus also caused miscarriages if acquired in pregnancy. These studies showed that some of the features of infection, including rash and joint symptoms, were due to an immunological mechanism.<br>
<br>While at the Clinical Research Centre at Northwick Park, and during his last few years, Tyrrell was involved in research at the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Research Foundation, which he also served as chairman. The reality of chronic fatigue syndrome (otherwise known as ME) as a disease entity was doubted by many medical practitioners, but as a result of Tyrrell's dedication, integrity, and persuasion, together with some of the research conducted by the research foundation, most practitioners became convinced that the syndrome, although not fatal, was debilitating and worthy of investigation.<br>
<br>Tyrrell, with his insatiable curiosity and breadth of knowledge, chaired many committees. Members were not only impressed by Tyrrell's chairmanship and leadership, but also came away having themselves acquired enhanced perception of some of the problems being discussed. Among the committees he chaired were the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (1981&#150;91), the Consultative Committee on Research into Spongiform Encephalopathies (1989&#150;90), the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (1990&#150;95), the Biological Sub-Committee of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (1989&#150;92), and the Task Force on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome / Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome (1993&#150;99). He was also a managing trustee of the Nuffield Foundation (1977&#150;92). Many honours were bestowed on him. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1970 and appointed CBE in 1980. He was also given honorary doctorates by Sheffield and Southampton, the Stuart prize of the British Medical Association (1977), the Ambuj Nath Bose prize (1983), and the Conway Evans prize, awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians (London) and the Royal Society (1986).<br>
<br>Tyrrell was a committed Christian and his musical interests involved acting as organist and choirmaster at All Saints' Church in Whiteparish, Salisbury, where he lived. He was president of the Christian Medical Fellowship and president of the Friends of the Christian Medical College at Ludhiana (Punjab) for almost twenty years. He died at Salisbury District Hospital of prostate cancer on 2 May 2005. He was survived by his wife, Moyra, and two daughters, his son having predeceased him. A symposium on RNA viruses and disease was held in his memory at the Royal Society, London, in October 2006. This was well attended by scientific colleagues, including many he had mentored, and friends.<br>
