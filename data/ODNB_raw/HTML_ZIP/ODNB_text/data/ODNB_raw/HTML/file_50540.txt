<span class="headword">Lollard knights</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>1380&#150;<em>c.</em>1414) <span class="occ"></span>is the name conventionally given to a close-knit group of influential courtiers, accused by contemporary chroniclers of promoting heretical Lollard doctrines during the reigns of Richard II and Henry IV. The Leicester chronicler Henry Knighton (writing during the 1380s) names <a name="cosubject_64916"></a><span class="headword">Sir Reynald Hilton</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1380)<span class="occ"></span>; <a name="cosubject_64917"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Pecche</span>  (<em>c.</em>1360&#150;1386)<span class="occ"></span>; <a name="cosubject_64920"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Trussell</span>  (1349&#150;1424)<span class="occ"></span>; <a name="cosubject_64918"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Stury</span>  (<em>c.</em>1327&#150;1395)<span class="occ"></span>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50259/', "Sir Lewis Clifford (c.1330&#150;1404)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50260/', "Sir Thomas Latimer (1341&#150;1401)")</script> as &#145;the strongest promoters and most powerful protectors&#146; of Lollard preachers  (<span class="italic">Chronicon Henrici Knighton</span>, 295). The St Albans chronicler Walsingham also independently cites Stury, Clifford, and Latimer, along with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19966/', "Sir William Neville (c.1341&#150;1391)")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37286/', "Sir John Clanvow (c.1341&#150;1391)")</script>, and (&#145;above all&#146;) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18995/', "Sir John Montagu (d. 1400)")</script> as Lollard partisans in 1387: the same source names Stury (&#145;the greatest supporter of perfidy&#146;; Walsingham, <span class="italic">Annales</span>, 174), Clifford, Latimer, and Montagu as promulgators of the radical Lollard &#145;twelve conclusions&#146; allegedly presented to parliament in 1395. Walsingham later added <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41195/', "Sir John Cheyne (d. 1414)")</script> to the list as a leading anti-clerical, and made further accusations against Montagu and Clifford.<br>
<br>The careers of these men were investigated by W. T. Waugh (1913), and far more thoroughly by K. B. McFarlane (1972). Of those named only by Knighton, Hilton cannot be satisfactorily identified&#151;it is possible that the chronicler was mistaken in describing him as a knight, and that the Reynold Hilton whom he had in mind was a priest, a servant of Edward, the Black Prince, who was controller of the king's wardrobe (1377&#150;81): but Pecche and Trussell (as well as Latimer) owned lands near the chronicler's Leicester, so that rumours of their activities may well have reached him. Pecche, who died young, was Sir Richard Stury's ward, while Trussell, a violent and lawless man, was associated with Lollard suspects much later, in 1418. The core of the group, however, were those accused either by both chroniclers (Stury, Clifford, and Latimer) or by Walsingham alone (Neville, Clanvow, Montagu, and Cheyne).<br>
<br>Though they were associated neither by area of origin nor blood relationship, these seven came to form a remarkably compact group: their careers were extraordinarily similar, and their public and private interrelationships very close. Again and again they appear together in documents as business partners, co-feoffees, and fellow executors, for each other or for mutual associates. All except Cheyne were career soldiers under Edward III; Clifford and Montagu were fellow knights of the Garter. Clifford, Stury, and perhaps Latimer were trusted retainers of the Black Prince, and by the 1380s all seven had achieved high status at the court of his son Richard II, five becoming knights of the king's chamber. In 1400 Montagu, now earl of Salisbury, was lynched for his share in a rising intended to restore the deposed King Richard. All except Latimer, moreover, served abroad as negotiators and diplomats. They were likewise a notably cultured group. Clifford, Stury, Neville, and Clanvow were all friends of Geoffrey Chaucer; Clifford also knew the French poet Eustace Deschamps, and Stury was an honoured associate of Froissart. Montagu was renowned in his own right for his French verse (now lost), while Clanvow wrote both an English love poem (&#145;The Boke of Cupide&#146;) and a moralizing treatise (known as <span class="italic">The Two Ways</span>).<br>
<br>Whether this highly placed group also shared a real belief in heretical doctrines has been more controversial. Waugh concluded that they were the victims of chroniclers' prejudices, or at worst short-term and superficial supporters of heresy. McFarlane, basing his statements on much more wide-ranging investigation, conversely declared that their notoriety as protectors of Lollards was well founded. Their apparent immunity from persecution, he believed, was due partly to their influence at court and partly to the ambiguous attitude to heresy that prevailed among lay and ecclesiastical authorities before the passing of <span class="italic">De haeretico comburendo</span> under Henry IV in 1401. Subsequent research has confirmed McFarlane's view.<br>
<br>Latimer's support for Lollardy (which even Waugh admitted) is the best documented from non-chronicle sources. A forceful defender of heretical preachers from at least 1388, his Leicestershire and Northamptonshire properties remained important centres of Lollard activity long after his death. Neville clearly protected the leading Lollard Nicholas Hereford, and may even have procured his escape from prison: thereafter (according to Walsingham) Hereford took refuge with the &#145;arch-heretic&#146; (as Walsingham saw him) and iconoclast Montagu. Neville's close friend Clanvow wrote an English pietistic treatise (itself a most unusual activity for a layman and courtier), which admits at least to accusations of heresy having been made against him and his friends. Clanvow's Herefordshire relations and associates, moreover, most probably lent powerful support to the Lollard evangelist William Swinderby. The evidence against Stury, admittedly, comes only from the repeated accusations of the chroniclers, but his association with the group is too close for these to be disregarded.<br>
<br>Clifford, Latimer, and Cheyne (as well as Latimer's widow, Cheyne's son, and Clanvow's heirs) moreover left wills remarkable for extravagant protestations of unworthiness, contempt for the body, and prohibition of funeral pomp&#151;all sentiments compatible with the puritan strain in Lollardy. Among Clifford's executors, indeed, was the future Lollard rebel, Sir John Oldcastle.<br>
<br>By the time of Oldcastle's revolt in 1414 all the original Lollard knights (except the marginal Trussell) were dead. The support this influential group gave to Lollardy had been crucial to its growth, but it had been given in the milder climate of Richard II's reign, when such opinions in high places could be tolerated or tacitly disregarded, despite the chroniclers' fulminations. The new generation of Lollard knights, younger men who supported Oldcastle (five knights and more than twenty esquires and gentlemen, including three of Cheyne's cousins, were implicated in his rising), lived in a different world, where government attitudes to heresy had hardened. By resorting to rebellion, these later and far less influential Lollard knights inextricably entangled Lollardy with treason, and so destroyed it as anything more than a persecuted lost cause.<br>
