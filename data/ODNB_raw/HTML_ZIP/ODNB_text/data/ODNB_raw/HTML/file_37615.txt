<span class="headword">Jones,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1564&#150;1615), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, who employed a variety of aliases, was born in the diocese of St Asaph, either near Chirk or in Oswestry. On 20 August 1581 he arrived at the English College then situated in Rheims. On 3 September 1582 he was sent to the English College in Rome where he was accepted on 6 November. On 26 May 1583 he entered the Jesuit noviciate in Rome. He completed his philosophical and theological training at the Roman College and was ordained at an unknown date in the early 1590s. About the same time he was appointed to the philosophical faculty of the Roman College: copies of student notes from his lectures can be found in various European archives. On 11 October 1594 Claudio Acquaviva, father general of the Society of Jesus, sent Jones to the English mission and by 25 February 1595, Jones was in London. Little is known about his activities in the 1590s save that he laboured in Wales and along the marches with periodic visits to London. Somewhere outside London he was professed of the four vows on 18 October 1603.<br>
<br>By the accession of King James, Jones had established an organization of recusant Welsh gentry, Welsh secular priests, and Jesuits. From a centre in Monmouthshire the network extended along the marches. Official government reports claimed that Jones himself frequented the Lacons and the Draycotts of Painsley (Shropshire), the Morgans of Llantarnam, and the Griffiths of Cwm near Monmouth, and celebrated mass weekly at the Darren on the Herefordshire border. In 1604 he sent students to Valladolid and Douai from Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and Monmouthshire. In 1605 Sir Herbert Croft, high sheriff of Herefordshire, warned London that recusants under Jesuit influence would take up arms against the king, accusing Jones of being the instigator. Despite the increased surveillance and vigilance as a result of the fury unleashed by the Gunpowder Plot, Jones eluded capture. He was considered the most likely candidate to succeed Henry Garnet as superior of the Jesuit mission after the latter's execution on 3 May 1606, but he asked to be excused.<br>
<br>More severe legislation followed the plot. To avoid financial disaster the ex-Jesuit Thomas Wright urged Catholics to attend churches, according to Jones, &#145;not to hear service, but to hear sermons&#146;&#151;which, unfortunately, happened to be commonly held during services  (Foley, 4.372). To stop the spread of such error Jones asked the Jesuit Robert Persons to lobby the Catholic church for a clear, forceful condemnation of these views.<br>
<br>Some time in the early 1600s Jones received into the Roman church Lady Frances Somerset, daughter of Edward Somerset, the fourth earl of Worcester, who, in 1596, had married Jones's patron William Morgan of Llantarnam. Through her Jones gained admission into the Worcester household at Raglan Castle. Eventually Jones reconciled Frances's sisters and her brother Henry Somerset, the earl's son and heir. By January 1609 the Somersets and the Morgans were the principal Catholics under Jones's direction.<br>
<br>Despite Jones's earlier reluctance Acquaviva named him superior of the English Jesuit mission on 28 March 1609. In letters to Jesuits on the mission Jones consistently stressed the importance of prayer, mutual support, and especially poverty, as Jesuits strove to follow a religious life in a hostile environment. He urged Acquaviva to send only &#145;truly discreet, prudent, mortified, humble and patient&#146; Jesuits to the mission  (Foley, 4.385&#150;6).<br>
<br>In 1609 Jones submitted an English translation of an unnamed treatise <i>de potestate papae</i> but Acquaviva denied permission for its publication. It is not clear from the correspondence whether Jones was the translator or simply submitting to censors the translation of another. His Italian account of the execution of Roger Cadualadr at Leominster in 1610 attempted to claim the secular priest as a Jesuit ally in the current tension between Jesuits and secular clergy in England.<br>
<br>Described as tall, broad faced, with a high forehead and large eyes, Jones relinquished not the office itself but its exercise to Michael Walpole on 24 November 1613 presumably for reasons of health. Two successive accidents within a short period as he hastened through the night to baptize a baby resulted in his death on 20 August 1615.<br>
