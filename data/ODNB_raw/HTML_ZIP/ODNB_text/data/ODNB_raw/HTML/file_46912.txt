<span class="headword">More <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Harpur; <em>other married name </em>Middleton]</span>,  Alice</span>, Lady More  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1474, <em>d.</em> in or before 1551), <span class="occ">second wife of Sir Thomas More</span>, was born, probably at Epping, Essex, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or after 1510), coheir of Sir Peter Ardern of Markhall, Essex, and her second husband, Sir Richard Harpur (<i>d</i>. 1492). After her father's death her mother married Sir Andrew Dymoke (<i>d</i>. 1508). Before 1492 Alice married John Middleton, a London mercer, who named her co-executor of his will in 1509 and left his fortune to her and their daughters, Alice (<i>c</i>.1501&#150;1563) and Helen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1510).<br>
<br>In 1511, about a month after his first wife's death, Alice married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19191/', "Thomas More (1478&#150;1535)")</script> and moved to his London home. He forwarded her thanks to Erasmus in 1516 for his wish that she have a long life, for it would enable her, she joked, to plague her husband all the longer. On a tomb at Chelsea, where they moved in 1525, Thomas lauded both wives as &#145;beloved&#146;  (Norrington, 56).<br>
<br>As his career advanced, More frequently left Alice alone to supervise the household; his only extant letter to her concerns their barn that burned down in 1529. Around the end of 1534, although she did not understand the reasons for his imprisonment, she petitioned the government for his relief. After his execution the crown voided the trust he had belatedly established for her but granted her an annuity of &pound;20 in 1537. She became entangled in lawsuits, one of them initiated by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24074/', "William Roper")</script>, her stepson-in-law, who depicted her as an interfering busybody in his account of Thomas's life. Writers have disparaged her role as a martyr's wife, even identifying her as the hook-beaked harpy mentioned in a letter of October 1511 from Ammonio, Henry VIII's Latin secretary, to Erasmus; Holbein's portrait contradicts this claim. She died on or before 25 April 1551 and was probably buried at Chelsea. Her daughter Alice had three children with Thomas Elrington and nine with her second husband, Sir Giles Alington. Through the Alington line Alice was an ancestor of Elizabeth II.<br>
