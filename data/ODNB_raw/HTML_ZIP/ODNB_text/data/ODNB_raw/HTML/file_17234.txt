<span class="headword">Lyall,  Alfred</span>  (1796&#150;1865), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born at Findon, Sussex, on 6 February 1796, the youngest son of John Lyall (1752&#150;1805), of Findon, who was engaged in shipping, and his wife, Jane Camming or Comyn (<i>d</i>. 1867), of Newcastle upon Tyne. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17235/', "George Lyall, MP")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17237/', "William Rowe Lyall, DD")</script>, dean of Canterbury, were his brothers. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated as a pensioner in 1813, and graduated BA in 1818.<br>
<br>After spending some time in Frankfurt and Geneva, Lyall settled in a small house of his own at Findon with his widowed mother, to whom he was devoted. While at Findon he edited the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> from 1822 to about 1827. The winter of 1825&#150;6 he passed with an invalid sister in Madeira, and on his return he published in 1827 an anonymous narrative entitled <span class="italic">Rambles in Madeira and Portugal</span>. The book was accompanied by a folio volume of lithographic sketches by Lyall's friend and fellow-traveller James Bulwer (<i>d</i>. 1879), later rector of Stody, Norfolk.<br>
<br>Subsequently Lyall returned to Findon and applied himself to philosophy. He produced, anonymously, a thin volume entitled <span class="italic">Principles of Necessary and Contingent Truth</span> (1830), which was intended as an introduction to a larger work that was never executed. In 1829 Lyall took holy orders, as curate to his old friend John Hind (<i>c</i>.1757&#150;1832), vicar of Findon.<br>
<br>In December 1830 Lyall married Mary Drummond (<i>c</i>.1812&#150;1878), the daughter of James T. Broadwood. They had eleven children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34641/', "Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall")</script>, lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces of India, and Sir James Broadwood Lyall (1838&#150;1916), lieutenant-governor of the Punjab.<br>
<br>The winter of 1833&#150;4 Lyall passed at Rome, where he kept a journal. In 1837 he was appointed vicar of Godmersham, Kent, and resumed the editorship of the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, at the request of Rivingtons, the proprietors. A serious illness soon forced him to give up the editorship, and, although a careful and charitable pastor and a good neighbour, he became unable to write much. In 1848 he became rector of Harbledown, near Canterbury.<br>
<br>In 1856, under the title <span class="italic">Agonistes, or philosophical strictures, by the author of the &#145;Principles of necessary and contingent truth&#146;</span>, Lyall published his maturer views, which resembled those of Sir William Hamilton. About a third of the book consists of a very close and generally adverse discussion of the philosophical theories of John Stuart Mill. Lyall also contributed to the &#145;History of the mediaeval church&#146; in volume 11 of the <span class="italic">Encyclopedia metropolitana</span>. He died at Llangollen, Denbighshire, on 11 September 1865, and was buried at Harbledown.<br>
