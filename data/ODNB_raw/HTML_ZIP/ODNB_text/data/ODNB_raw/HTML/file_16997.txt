<span class="headword">Longueville,  William</span>  (1639&#150;1721), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the only son of Sir Thomas Longueville, knight, of Bradwell Abbey, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Anne Ashcombe, second daughter and coheir of Sir William Ashcombe of Alvescot, Oxfordshire. He was entered as a student at the Inner Temple in November 1654; he then matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 25 July 1655 and was created MA in special congregation on 28 September 1663. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1660, was called to the bench in 1677, and he became an autumn reader in 1682, a Lent reader in 1685, and treasurer in 1695. He was one of the six clerks in chancery from 1660 to 1678. These were six officers who received and filed bills, answers, replications, and other documents on the equity side of the court. He was a successful conveyancer, and by his practice was able to restore the fortunes of his family, which his father had ruined. He married Elizabeth (1647&#150;1716), third daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Peyton, second baronet, of Knowlton, Kent, and his second wife, Cecilia. They had two sons, Charles and William, who died in the East Indies, and two daughters, Catherine and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Longueville was a close friend of Sir Francis North, the lord keeper, and his brother Roger. The best account of him is given by Roger North in the <span class="italic">Life</span> of his brother; there he is described as one of the lord keeper's most intimate friends, valued for his &#145;fluent, witty, litterate, copious and instructive&#146; conversation and for his knowledge and love of the classics and poetry  (North, <span class="italic">Life of the Lord Keeper</span>, 458). For a time Roger North, who had leased Sir Peter Lely's house in Covent Garden, London, lived near to Longueville, who occupied a house in Bow Street, Covent Garden, but the connection and friendship between the Norths and Longueville may have been closer. The Peytons of Knowlton, the family of Longueville's wife, Elizabeth, were a branch of the Peytons of Isleham; Thomas Peyton of Isleham married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Yelverton, of Rougham, Norfolk, the property that Roger North bought in 1690&#150;91. As early as 1672 Francis North was given a mortgage over this property by Yelverton Peyton, and in the mid-1680s his sister Elizabeth Wiseman also held a mortgage over Rougham.<br>
<br>Longueville was also a close friend of the poet Samuel Butler. Roger North describes him as &#145;the last patron and friend poor old Butler, the author of <span class="roman">Hudibras</span> had, and in his effete old age he supported him, otherwise he might have bin literally starved&#146;. Butler repaid him by making him his heir: &#145;that is gave him his remaines, but in loos papers, and indegested&#146;. Longueville &#145;reduced them to method and order, where they lye out of reach of the tapstering printers&#146;  (ibid.). They are now in the British Library  (Add. MS 32625). An edition with notes was published by Robert Thyer in 1759.<br>
<br>William Longueville has been identified as the Mr Longueville who is referred to by George Farquhar in his preface to <span class="italic">The Twin Rivals</span> (1703), of whom Farquhar says he &#145;must own [him]self obliged &hellip; for some lines in the part of Teague, and something of the lawyer; but above all, for his hint of the twins, upon which I formed my plot&#146;. That this refers to the William Longueville discussed here was questioned by Charles Stonehill in a note to his edition of Farquhar's <span class="italic">Works</span>, who refers to<blockquote>a marginal note in the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span> (ed. 1793, vol. 5) [which] says that Longueville was &#145;as we are told, our author's countryman, and a fencing master, as was also his son, James &hellip;&#146; It does seems unlikely that anyone but an Irishman could have given help in composing the lines of Teague. (1.398)</blockquote>Letters from Longueville are preserved in the Hatton papers in the British Library  (Add. MSS 29550&#150;29586), some of which are printed in the Camden Society edition of the <span class="italic">Correspondence of the Family of Hatton</span>.<br>
<br>Longueville died on 21 March 1721 in London and was buried on 30 March in Edward the Confessor's chapel, Westminster Abbey. Apart from his property, which passed to his son, and mourning for his two daughters, he left &pound;50 each to the school of St Clement Danes and &#145;to the poor of the said parish as my executor shall finde to be objects of pitty&#146;.<br>
