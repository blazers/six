<span class="headword">Marwick, Sir  Brian Allan</span>  (1908&#150;1992), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born in Natal on 18 June 1908, the son of James Walter Marwick and his wife, (Elizabeth) Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Flett. On his father's side his family was of Orcadian descent and had produced a number of outstanding civil servants, linguists, and anthropologists. His uncle, John Sydney Marwick, was a Natal colonial civil servant who led the exodus of Zulu mineworkers from the Witwatersrand on the outbreak of the South African War in 1899, and went on to make a career as a labour recruiter and South African Party politician. Another uncle, Allan Graham Marwick, was an outstanding Swazi linguist and colonial civil servant who served in Swaziland for more than thirty years, ending as resident commissioner in 1935&#150;7, retiring to Swaziland, and dying there in 1966. Allan Marwick had accompanied Prince Malunge and the Swazi deputation to London in 1907 as interpreter, and believed that the Colonial Office broke promises made then by Lord Elgin on land distribution in the protectorate. He was the author of <span class="italic">The Attitude of the Swazi towards Government and its Causes</span> (1955), which must be the most remarkable indictment of a colonial administration ever written by one of its long-serving members. He was highly respected by the Swazi not only as a mentor and trusted adviser to Sobhuza II, but also as one of the founding ideologists of Swazi &#145;traditionalism&#146;.<br>
<br>Brian Marwick joined the Swaziland administrative service as a cadet in 1925. During his first decade in Swaziland he did an external degree by correspondence with the University of South Africa and a master's degree in social anthropology at the University of Cape Town under Isaac Schapera. Cambridge University Press published his dissertation as a substantial book, <span class="italic">The Swazi</span>, in 1940. This was an ethnographic study and was for a time the standard monograph on the Swazi. A good linguist, he had published another book on the Swazi in Zulu, <span class="italic">Abantu Bakwa Ngwane</span>, in the previous year. Meanwhile, he had in 1934 married Riva Lee Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1988), daughter of Major H. C. Cooper. They had two daughters (one of whom became a lecturer at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art).<br>
<br>Wishing to escape from the limited career prospects offered by Swaziland and the high commission territories, Marwick transferred to the colonial service in 1936, did a training course at Cambridge, and was then posted to northern Nigeria where he served from 1937 to 1940. He greatly enjoyed his time in Nigeria, mastered a number of local languages, and regretted his recall to Swaziland. After his return to the protectorate he served as a district commissioner until 1946, and then as first assistant secretary. He was transferred to Basutoland in 1949 and was deputy resident commissioner and government secretary there from 1952 to 1955. After a short period as administrative secretary for the protectorates in the office of the British high commissioner in Pretoria, he was appointed resident commissioner for Swaziland in 1957, from January 1964 becoming commissioner for Swaziland with somewhat enhanced powers. He was made OBE in 1946, CBE in 1954, and CMG in 1958, and was knighted KBE in 1963.<br>
<br>Between 1957 and 1964 Marwick presided over one of the most turbulent periods in Swaziland's history. Economic developments included the establishment of an iron ore mine, the building of a railway to Louren&ccedil;o Marques, and the tarring of the main road through the territory. Political developments began with the demand for a legislative council, and included the formation of political parties, the Swaziland Progressive Party, the Swaziland Democratic Party, and the Ngwane National Liberatory Congress (NNLC), and two years of negotiations over a new constitution, which ended in abortive talks in London in January 1963. The turbulence was also the consequence of the &#145;winds of change&#146; blowing through the sub-continent, the Sharpeville crisis in South Africa in 1960, the subsequent influx into Swaziland of South African political refugees, and the movement towards independence in the rest of Africa.<br>
<br>Although he had had a long-standing and cordial relationship with Sobhuza (he had the siSwati name <i>Musawendvodza</i>, son of a trusted man) Marwick placed himself on a collision course with him and the Swazi National Council&#151;a council of chiefs and elders with powers over Swazi nation land, law, and custom&#151;through his attempt to insist from 1960 onwards that Sobhuza should prepare himself for the role of constitutional monarch and that he and the council should remain above politics. He opposed Sobhuza's attempt to make a power-sharing deal with the European Advisory Council, which was dominated by big business interests. Sobhuza and the settlers, represented by the sugar baron Carl Todd, found common cause in opposition to universal suffrage and sought a constitution that would neutralize the threat of radical nationalism. While Sobhuza also sought to ensure that control over land and minerals was entrusted to the &#145;traditional&#146; authorities, Todd sought to protect the interests of employers against the threat of progressive labour legislation, trade unions, and industrial action. Marwick, by contrast, was determined that there should be movement towards elections with universal suffrage on a common roll. He also pressed for improvements in wages and working conditions. Nevertheless in June 1963 he was compelled by simultaneous strikes at the Havelock asbestos mine and the Ubombo Ranches, a &#145;general strike&#146; in the capital, Mbabane, and the fear of South African intervention, to request the airlift of British troops from Nairobi to augment the over-stretched police force. He also ordered the arrest of leaders of the Ngwane National Liberatory Congress who had been involved in the organization of these strikes.<br>
<br>In January 1964 the British government imposed an interim constitution under which the members of the new legislative council were to be chosen by voters on a common electoral roll, by voters on a &#145;white&#146; roll, and by &#145;traditional&#146; means. Sobhuza was not happy with this compromise, which also failed to give him control over minerals, and organized an unofficial referendum on the constitution. This was widely seen as a contest between himself and Marwick. The voting symbol for those who opposed the constitution was a lion, while the symbol for supporters of the constitution was an alien creature, the reindeer. Not surprisingly it was claimed that the lion obtained an overwhelming majority of the votes cast. Sobhuza, prompted by the decision of the Ngwane National Liberatory Congress to participate in the forthcoming elections, had meanwhile decided to do the same through the establishment of a king's party, the Imbokodvo (&#145;grinding stone&#146;) National Movement. Marwick, who had been due to retire in 1963, and had stayed on for an extra year, left the country in April 1964 before the elections under the new constitution took place. He was, however, determined to make his disapproval of Sobhuza and the Swazi National Council's formal entry into the political arena known. He prepared a critical speech, which he intended to deliver at his farewell meeting with Sobhuza. He was presuaded by Sobhuza not to deliver the speech as written, but its text was published in the <span class="italic">Times of Swaziland</span>. Marwick warned that if the king's party was to win the elections &#145;the King is in a powerful and safe position&#151;for the time being&#151;but if at a later date that group is replaced by a rival the king is likely to find himself cast aside as well&#146;  (Halpern, 361). He also warned that &#145;by misusing your staff and machinery for electioneering purposes as I have no doubt you intend to do, you will do more to put Swazi against Swazi and to bring the kingship into disrepute than by any other act&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>After his retirement from Swaziland Marwick worked on contract for six years in the Bahamas, as permanent secretary at the Ministry of Works and Town Planning from 1965 to 1968 and then at the Ministry of Education from 1968 to 1971. He then retired to the Isle of Man, where he died on 1 April 1992. He was survived by his two daughters.<br>
<br>Marwick was an imposing man who did not suffer fools gladly. He had a greater knowledge and better understanding of Swaziland than any other colonial official and clearly foresaw the dangers which would almost inevitably arise from the concentration of power, including the control of mineral wealth, in the hands of the king and the chiefs. He and his wife returned for the independence celebrations in 1968, but the Westminster-model constitution did not survive for long. In 1973 Sobhuza banned all political parties, including his own, and parliament dissolved itself. Sobhuza and the Swazi National Council believed that Marwick had, through his apparent support for political modernization, betrayed their trust and the ideals of his uncle, A. G. Marwick. But supporters of the banned nationalist parties continued to acknowledge his prescience through more than thirty years of royal autocracy.<br>
