<span class="headword">Topcliffe,  Richard</span>  (1531&#150;1604), <span class="occ">interrogator and torturer</span>, was born on 14 November 1531, the eldest son of Robert Topcliffe of Somerby, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Thomas, third Baron Burgh of Gainsborough. Orphaned at twelve, Topcliffe's wardship was granted to his uncle Sir Anthony Neville. In 1548 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, but he does not seem to have attended university, concentrating instead on administering his inherited estates in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and at Topcliffe in the North Riding of Yorkshire. By his own account Topcliffe entered the queen's service shortly before her accession. This introduction may have been secured through the family of his wife, Jane Willoughby of Wollaton, one of whose nieces was an attendant to Princess Elizabeth at Hatfield; it may also help to explain the royal favour that Topcliffe enjoyed throughout his life and the peculiar political licence, in more than one sense, that he came to exercise.<br>
<br>Through the Willoughbys, Topcliffe also had access to the patronage of the earls of Leicester and Warwick. These connections, added to those derived from the service of his guardian Neville to successive earls of Shrewsbury, laid the basis for a career which was relatively unremarkable until Topcliffe was well into his fifties. In January 1570 he raised a band of thirty horses and men at Kenilworth in response to the northern rising, and was later rewarded with stewardship of the lands confiscated from the rebel leader Richard Norton. In 1572 it was probably Leicester who secured for him the parliamentary seat of Beverley and most of what is known of his activities in the 1570s&#151;in parliament and elsewhere&#151;relates to the aftermath of the rising and the investigation of the rebels. It seems to have been this line of work, secured for him by Shrewsbury in 1578 and made more widely applicable by the arrival of the Jesuit mission to England in 1580, that set Topcliffe on the road to becoming the most notorious of those government servants who sought out and interrogated enemies of the crown. The queen's encouragement was a spur. In 1578 Topcliffe related how, during one of many royal progresses at which he was present, she informed him personally of &#145;sundry lewde Popishe beasts&#146; who were resorting to Buxton  (Nichols, 217). It was a theme to which he returned in parliament nine years later, blaming religious superstition in Derbyshire on &#145;ignorance for lacke of learned ministers&#146;  (Hartley, 391). This strongly protestant tone was echoed on other occasions. He complained that Staffordshire was &#145;backwod&#146; in terms of reformed religion  (Hammer, 174), and in correspondence with Shrewsbury deplored the silencing of &#145;good preachers&#146; in East Anglia merely for &#145;a lytell nycenes&#146; in their theology  (Nichols, 217).<br>
<br>Topcliffe's pursuit of Catholics escalated from the beginning of 1582, and in October of that year he began to be named in Catholic correspondence not just as an interrogator of suspects but also as a torturer. Such work was sanctioned in two ways. Topcliffe was appointed to official commissions, such as those of August 1588 and January 1592, charged with examining imprisoned recusants and priests. Meanwhile, in particular cases he was issued with conciliar warrants authorizing interrogation through the use of torture. In support of these duties Topcliffe was also involved in the search for suspects and in their arrest. This could be as a result of his own initiative, at the behest of the council, or at the request of the House of Commons, as in February 1587, or through official commissions such as that of March 1593.<br>
<br>Evidence directly linking Topcliffe with the use of torture is sparse in the 1580s. He was reported to have racked a prisoner named John Getter in the Tower in 1582  (Caraman, <span class="italic">The Other Face</span>, 243) but it was as an interrogator who cowed and bullied victims &#145;in most railing manner, as is always usual with him&#146; that Topcliffe became widely known in the mid-1580s  (Caraman, <span class="italic">Gerard</span>, 270). By now he was a Lincolnshire justice and MP for Old Sarum, a borough in the patronage of the Shrewsburys. Outside politics he had interests in peat extraction and droving, but at Westminster during the Commons sessions of 1584&#150;5 and 1586&#150;7 he was most active in those committees and debates that discussed the Catholic menace, religious disorders, and state security. His absence from parliament after 1587 seems to have been the result of a rift with Shrewsbury, which may in turn have derived from Topcliffe's developing reputation. From September 1588 privy council records show him regularly employed in torturing government prisoners.<br>
<br>Torture authorized by government had been in steady use in England since the mid-1530s but it seems to have increased markedly in the 1580s as Catholic missionary activity escalated. Many were now involved in its authorization&#151;councillors, legal officers, even bishops&#151;yet it was Topcliffe who in the decade from 1588 came primarily to symbolize this most wretched aspect of the Tudor regime. Catholic correspondents were sickened by the relish with which &#145;the cruellest tyrant of all England&#146; undertook his duties  (Caraman, <span class="italic">Gerard</span>, 230), while in court circles in the mid-1590s the rack and other officially sanctioned instruments of torture were referred to as &#145;our Topcliffian customs&#146;  (Birch, 160). Questions concerning the legality of these customs, their authorization, and the limits to which they could be taken came together in the case of the Jesuit missionary Robert Southwell. In June 1592 Topcliffe graphically sought the queen's permission for the course he intended to take: the prisoner should be manacled at the wrists with &#145;his feett standinge upon the grounde, &amp; his hands But as highe as he can wratche [reach] against the wawle [wall]&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 72). At his trial in February 1595 Southwell stated that he had been tortured on ten occasions, whereupon, according to Catholic reports, Attorney-General Coke commented that &#145;Mr Topcliffe has no need to go about to excuse his proceedings in the manner of his torturing&#146;  (Heath, 143), and Topcliffe himself justified his own actions by reference to a conciliar warrant authorizing Southwell's torture short of death or maiming.<br>
<br>This was Topcliffe's most notorious case. In the last years of Lord Burghley, the harshest rigours of conciliar policy against Catholics diminished, as did Topcliffe's protected position. He was briefly imprisoned in 1595 for maligning privy councillors, and while in the Marshalsea complained to the queen of his treatment in characteristic terms: &#145;by this disgrace &hellip; the freshe deade boanes of Father Southwell at Tyburne and Father Wallpoole at Yorke, executed bothe since Shrovetyde, wyll daunce for joye&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 9889). Once released, Topcliffe was in further trouble, councillors examining him early in 1596 about his arbitrary treatment of prisoners in the Gatehouse. Nevertheless, now in his mid-sixties and in the eyes of his victims &#145;hoary and a veteran in evil&#146;  (Caraman, <span class="italic">Gerard</span>, 68), Topcliffe was employed by the council for a further four years in applying the manacles to various of its prisoners in Bridewell&#151;plotters, thieves, murderers, &#145;Egipcians and wanderers&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1596&#150;7</i>, 325). In August 1597 he was also responsible for initiating a government inquiry into the scandalous play <span class="italic">The Isle of Dogs</span>, during which he was required to interview Thomas Nash and his fellow players in the Fleet prison. In the event Nash made himself scarce, but Topcliffe did interrogate Ben Jonson and two actors.<br>
<br>Topcliffe's last years were clouded by lameness and domestic troubles. His nephew Edmund renounced the now odious family name, and his eldest son, Charles, was twice convicted of felony. Nevertheless Elizabeth continued to receive Topcliffe and seek his views on security matters. He retained his house at Westminster churchyard where he kept a &#145;stronge chamber&#146; and detained suspects in &#145;hande gyves [fetters]&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 72), but increasingly withdrew to his estates at Somerby and Padley Hall, Derbyshire, the latter acquired from the impecunious Catholic Thomas Fitzherbert as part of a contract under which Topcliffe undertook to use persecution as a means of bringing about the early deaths of Fitzherbert's father, uncle, and cousin. Topcliffe died in November or December 1604, leaving most of his possessions to his son Charles. He had three other sons and two daughters.<br>
