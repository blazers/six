<span class="headword">Bowes,  John</span>  (1811&#150;1885), <span class="occ">coal industrialist and art collector</span>, was born at 13 South Street, Chelsea, London, on 19 June 1811, the illegitimate son of John Bowes, tenth earl of Strathmore (1769&#150;1820), and Mary (1787&#150;1860), the daughter of George and Ann Milner of Stainton, co. Durham. His grandmother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3056/', "Mary Eleanor Bowes, countess of Strathmore")</script>. Mary Milner had become Strathmore's mistress about 1809, after his two failed love affairs with members of the Delaval family, and John Bowes was their only child. The earl married Mary on his deathbed with the aim of legitimizing their son by Scots law. Bowes's claim to the title was rejected in 1821, but he succeeded to the estates of Streatlam near Barnard Castle and of Gibside near Newcastle. He was educated at private schools in Ealing and Lincolnshire, and then at Eton College. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1828, where his tutor was William Hutt (1801&#150;1882); Bowes's mother, Mary, married Hutt in 1831.<br>
<br>Bowes and Hutt entered parliament in 1832. Without party affiliation but supporting reform, the anti-slavery movement, and religious liberty and toleration, Bowes was elected for South Durham. He was re-elected in 1835, 1837, and 1841, but he declined to stand in 1847; he never spoke in the house but was regarded as a good lobbyist.<br>
<br>Bowes, his mother, Hutt, and Nicholas Wood (1795&#150;1865) created the Marley Hill Coal Company in 1839, to exploit the coals on the Gibside estate. Bowes had also inherited his father's stud at Streatlam and he bred four Derby winners. Betting on his own winning horse in the 1843 Derby he won &pound;21,000, which enabled him to meet his 1841 election expenses and put &pound;4000 into the temporarily ailing coal company. In 1844 Charles Mark Palmer (1822&#150;1907) joined the business, and in 1847 the company was renamed John Bowes Esq. &amp; Partners. It soon became one of the greatest companies in British coal history and the source of Bowes's wealth.<br>
<br>Since a continental tour in 1830 Bowes had made several visits to Paris and he decided to settle there in 1847. A keen theatre-goer and an amateur actor from his early days, he bought the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s for more than &pound;15,000. There he met Josephine Beno&icirc;te Coffin-Chevallier (1825&#150;1874), an actress and painter, whom he married on 23 August 1852. With a town house in the rue de Berlin, Bowes bought a ch&acirc;teau by the Seine as a country retreat, and stocked it with works of art. It was sold in 1860, and some of the contents were shipped to Streatlam.<br>
<br>Bowes and Josephine had now determined on a museum for their art collections, and in 1869 the Bowes Museum, which was designed in an elaborate French-Renaissance style, was begun at Barnard Castle. Josephine died in February 1874, while the museum was still under construction. Three years later, on 18 August 1877, Bowes married Alphonsine, comtesse de Courten (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1837), who was also French. Bowes's second marriage proved to be troubled, as Alphonsine spoke no English and disliked the north of England. She returned to France, leaving Bowes behind, on more than one occasion. He took divorce proceedings against his wife between 1883 and 1885, but a compromise was reached and they remained married, but separate, for the last few months of Bowes's life. Neither marriage produced any children.<br>
<br>Work continued on the museum, at considerable expense, but Bowes's last years were troubled, and he suffered ill health. He died on 9 October 1885 at Streatlam Castle and was buried at Gibside, on 16 October, alongside the remains of his first wife. With his financial affairs in some disarray, his gross personal estate of &pound;147,874 19<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. was insufficient to meet the very generous bequests of his will. The museum was officially opened in 1892 and remained a major collection of French art at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
