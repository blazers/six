<span class="headword">Lucy, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1583<span class="mult">x</span>6&#150;1640), <span class="occ">magistrate and politician</span>, was the eldest surviving son of Sir Thomas Lucy (1551&#150;1605), of Charlecote, Warwickshire, and his second wife, Constance, daughter and heir of Richard Kingsmill of Highclere, Hampshire. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 8 May 1601, was admitted as a student at Lincoln's Inn on 13 May 1602, and was knighted in 1603.<br>
<br>As a young man Lucy was drawn into the intellectual and literary life of London. He made the acquaintance of John Donne at the London house of his fellow Warwickshire landowner, Sir Henry Goodere, who was also patron to Ben Jonson, he was eulogized by a minor poet, John Davis, as a &#145;Bright spark of wit and courage&#146;  (Fairfax-Lucy, 114n.), and he developed a close friendship with the unconventional polymath Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Lucy spent much of his time in the household maintained by Herbert's mother and the two men had their portraits painted in classical attire by William Larkin. In 1608 Lucy joined Herbert in Paris, where he shared his study of music and also became involved in two abortive duels. On their return to Dover in February 1609 the two men nearly perished in a shipwreck.<br>
<br>With his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66713/', "Alice Lucy (d. 1648)")</script>, daughter of Thomas Spencer of Claverdon, Warwickshire, whom he married about 1610, Sir Thomas appears to have settled down to living at his ancestral home at Charlecote Park, where they had six sons and four daughters. He did not abandon his literary interests but continued to correspond with Donne and Herbert, maintained his acquaintance with Goodere and built up a large library at Charlecote which was later illustrated on his funeral monument. He also developed an interest in antiquarianism which brought him into contact with William Dugdale. He was said to be &#145;so rare and proficient&#146; in either &#145;sacred or secular learning&#146; that &#145;he was accounted a living library&#146;  (Dugard, postscript).<br>
<br>Sir Thomas, however, made his principal mark in local affairs. His family had been a significant presence in Warwickshire since at least the thirteenth century and the marriages of his father and grandfather brought extensive additional estates which made him one of the wealthiest landowners in the shire, with an annual income of over &pound;3500. From the 1610s through to the end of the 1630s he served in the principal county offices of justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant and established a reputation as a conscientious and diligent administrator. He regularly attended quarter sessions, took responsibility for the military affairs of the shire, acted as the arbiter of disputes involving his neighbours and became a principal benefactor of the boroughs of Stratford upon Avon and Warwick. For much of this period he was the most influential landowner in the southern half of the shire and his status was acknowledged in his apparently uncontested election to parliament as knight of the shire in 1614, 1621, 1624, 1625, 1626, 1628, and the Short Parliament of 1640. He was also returned as MP for Warwick borough to the Long Parliament, but it is doubtful that he ever took his seat as he was already ill in the spring of 1640.<br>
<br>In national politics Lucy was a much less significant figure. He is not recorded as having made any major speech in parliament, and his most significant contribution was, perhaps, to present Warwickshire's complaints against patentees in 1621. However, he does provide a good example of the growing disillusionment among county gentry with the political and religious policies of the Caroline regime. He kept himself informed about national politics as part of a network of local gentry corresponding with the London newsletter writer John Pory and he was on good terms with lord keeper Coventry and secretary of state Sir John Coke who shared his moderate views. While in most respects he served the regime loyally, he was also involved in opposition to some of its more contentious policies. There were rumours that he was opposed to the forced loan and when the levy was being collected in Warwickshire in 1627 he was conspicuous by his absence, preferring to pay in London. During the 1630s he was closely associated with the opposition peer Lord Brooke and at dinner parties at Warwick Castle he met with other leading critics of the crown, such as John Pym, Lord Saye and Sele, and his brother-in-law, Richard Knightley. Finally in February 1640, a few months before his death, he was removed from the commission of the peace, probably because he was seen as obstructing the collection of ship money in south Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Lucy's service in local office and his readiness to challenge the crown on sensitive issues helped to establish a reputation as the archetypal &#145;patriot&#146; or &#145;public man&#146;, devoted to the service of the common weal. He was also a moderate puritan and patron of godly ministers, such as Robert Harris of Hanwell, and he was acclaimed for his hospitality towards the poor and for generosity to his tenants. Lucy died at Charlecote Park on 8 December 1640 following a fall from a horse, and was buried, as he requested, among his ancestors in the chancel of the parish church at Charlecote. The tribute paid to him by Harris at his funeral was a classic description of the role to which he had aspired:<blockquote>
<div>A noble lady hath lost not an husband (as she saith) but a father.<br>
</div>
<div>Many children have lost not a father, but a counsellor.<br>
</div>
<div>An houseful of servants have lost not a master but a physician who made (as I am informed) their sickness his, and his physic and cost theirs.<br>
</div>
<div>Townes full of tenants have lost a landlord that could both protect and direct them in their own way.<br>
</div>
<div>The whole neighbourhood have lost a light.<br>
</div>
<div>The countie a leader.<br>
</div>
<div>The countrey a patriot, to whom he was not wanting till he was wanting to himself in his former vigour and health.<br>
</div> (Harris, 25&#150;6)</blockquote>
