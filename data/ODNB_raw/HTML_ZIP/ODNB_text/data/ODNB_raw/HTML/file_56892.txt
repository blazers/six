<span class="headword">Joules,  Horace</span>  (1902&#150;1977), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of Richard Edgar Joules (1872&#150;1949), master grocer, and his wife, Emily Ann Hyatt (<i>b</i>. 1875), was born at Woodseaves, High Offley Road, Newport, Shropshire, on 21 March 1902. He was educated at Newport grammar school before studying medicine at Cardiff and at Middlesex Hospital medical school; he qualified MB, BS, in 1925. In 1928 he was awarded the MD from London University, with gold medal. In 1930 he married Mary Sparrow (<i>b</i>. 1906); they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>After a period as registrar to the Middlesex and Brompton hospitals, and as resident physician to the Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, Joules became the first senior physician at the Central Middlesex Hospital in north-west London in 1935 and was appointed its medical director shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War. He was elected FRCP in 1943. By the start of the National Health Service in 1948, Joules had helped to raise the Central Middlesex to a dominant place among the non-teaching hospitals of the country. His passion for preventive medicine came from his experience with his own patients: young women with pulmonary tuberculosis, older men with chronic bronchitis or lung cancer, miners crippled with silicosis. He was indignant when he saw his patients suffering needlessly from their environment or their own habits. After the black smog of December 1952, which caused 4000 extra deaths in London, Joules, as a member of the Central Health Services Council, pressed for a <span class="roman">Clean Air Act</span>. It became law in 1956 and resulted in the disappearance of this type of smog from London and other cities.<br>
<br>At the end of the war tuberculosis was a serious problem and 11,000 patients were awaiting treatment in British hospitals. The high incidence of tuberculosis and the consequent risk to nurses caused many general hospitals to refuse admission to these patients. In 1945 Joules opened two wards for tuberculosis at the Central Middlesex but he took great care to safeguard nurses' health by insisting on masks and protective clothing. As a result very few nursing staff became infected, far fewer than in the London teaching hospitals or in those of the London county council. Following the work of Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill in 1952, Joules also campaigned strongly against cigarette smoking. A heavy smoker for thirty years, he managed to break himself of the habit.<br>
<br>Joules was inspired by Somerville Hastings and was a founder member of the Socialist Medical Association. During the Spanish Civil War he worked with the Spanish medical aid committee. He visited the Soviet Union and China where some aspects of their health services greatly impressed him. Many students remembered Joules best, however, for his popular Friday afternoon teaching rounds. He towered above all others, wagging his finger for emphasis. There was a dynamic cut and thrust at the bedside, and woe betide the student who did not know the occupation and social background of his patient.<br>
<br>In private life Joules was a keen gardener. He also enjoyed birdwatching in the Essex marshes, accompanied by a volume of the writings of his favourite poet and natural philosopher, John Clare. In 1962 the illness that had first shown itself during the war returned and forced him into early retirement. When his manic depression was at last controlled he lived quietly at home. He died in Colchester on 25 January 1977 and was cremated at Colchester crematorium on 30 January.<br>
