<span class="headword">Pocock,  William Fuller</span>  (1779&#150;1849), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in the City of London, possibly at Fetter Lane, on 26 September 1779, the eldest son of William Pocock (1750&#150;1835), a carpenter and joiner, and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of Major Fuller of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Both of his parents were Methodists. The Pococks moved in the mid-1780s to Leyton, in Essex, where William Pocock the elder traded as a builder, before branching out into the letting of furnished properties and furniture making; stacking tables (then a new concept) were a speciality. Intended for his father's trade, William Fuller Pocock was so impressed by watching the supervision of house building in Moorfields that he resolved to be an architect. He was accordingly articled to Samuel Beazley, and in 1799, while still under his care, sent his first drawing of a mausoleum to the Royal Academy. Pocock was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools in 1801, shortly before he became assistant to Thomas Hardwick. About 1803 he set up in practice as an independent architect and surveyor, and ran his office from 26 Southampton Street, off the Strand.<br>
<br>A freeman of the City of London, Pocock quickly established himself in the world of London property and building. Most of his exhibited early works tended towards the commemorative and sepulchral, including in 1803 a design for an obelisk at Hafod, Wales, in memory of the fifth duke of Bedford, and a design for a Temple of Fame, shown in 1806. His executed work was more prosaic. Pocock designed a number of suburban villas and rural structures: his first book, published in 1807 by John Taylor, was <span class="italic">Architectural designs for rustic cottages, picturesque dwellings, villas, etc. with appropriate scenery</span>. This contained advice on the causes of dry rot alongside aesthetic musings, besides the thirty-three plates of rural designs for villas and &#145;cabannes orn&eacute;es&#146;, mainly in the &#145;antient English character&#146;, some of which had already been built. Pocock had bought land at Camberwell, Surrey, upon which to build his own cottage in 1805: here he lived with his wife, Fanny Willmer, whom he married on 10 February 1809. They subsequently moved to Virginia Water, Surrey, where Pocock built a cottage named Glenridge, on Callow Hill, commenced in 1825.<br>
<br>Pocock was surveyor to a number of estates, including those of the Brewers' Company and of Viscount Dungannon, the ground landlord of the Trevor estate in Knightsbridge. In 1811 Pocock began to build a number of houses on the latter estate, on the site of Powis House: one of these, 10 Trevor Place, was to be his principal London residence. A speculative developer in his own right, he also oversaw the construction on lands across greater London on behalf of a number of institutions. His strong commercial connections led not only to factory commissions but also to designs for the suburban retreats of these industrialists. Pocock balanced his busy professional life with much building activity on behalf of the Methodist church. He designed a wide range of public buildings as well as housing, and in this he was representative of the increasingly complex nature of early nineteenth-century architecture. These included chapels such as the Ranelagh Chapel, George Street, Chelsea, of 1818 (dem.) and the Kensington Wesleyan chapel of 1836, and the Wesleyan centenary hall in Bishopsgate Street (1840; dem.); schools, such as that at Aldenham, Hertfordshire, for the Brewers' Company of 1825, or the Western Grammar School, Kensington, of 1835; a new livery hall for the Leathersellers' Company, off Bishopsgate, in 1820 (dem.); almshouses, such as the Carpenters' Company almshouse at Twickenham of 1841; factories, including Messrs Smith and Baber's floorcloth manufactory in Knightsbridge of 1824 (dem.); and militia depots: Pocock, a zealous volunteer, designed the Bunhill Row headquarters of the London militia in 1828. He also designed a ballroom for a hotel in Montreal, Canada (1817), and a chapel in Antigua (1837). These were executed in a mixture of styles: Pocock was happiest as a classicist, but was adept at designing in a restrained Tudorbethan idiom also. His <span class="italic">Designs for Churches and Chapels</span> of 1819 (3rd edn, 1835) enjoyed wide circulation in its day, but was much criticized by later Gothicists for its lack of authenticity and meanness of detail. His other publications consisted of <span class="italic">Modern Finishings for Rooms: a Series of Designs for Vestibules, Staircases, Libraries, etc.</span> (1811; repr. 1823, 1837) and <span class="italic">Observations on Bond in Brickwork</span> (1839).<br>
<br>Pocock was master of the Carpenters' Company in 1840 and an early member of the Institute of British Architects. His wife died in 1833 and was buried in a tomb designed by Pocock in Egham churchyard in Surrey. A cautious, thorough, and devout man, Pocock himself died, at his home, 10 Trevor Place, Knightsbridge, on 29 October 1849, aged seventy; his last audible words were &#145;Glory, glory, Halleluyah, Halleluyah, Halleluyah&#146;  (Pocock, 58). He was also buried at Egham. His professional practice was continued by his son William Willmer Pocock (1813&#150;1899), who wrote an affectionate account of his father, printed in 1883. An album containing prints and drawings by William Pocock is in the collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects.<br>
