<span class="headword">Hirsch,  Clara  de</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Clara Bischoffsheim]</span>, Baroness de Hirsch  (1833&#150;1899), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born in Brussels on 18 June 1833, the daughter of the Jewish banker Raphael Jonathan Bischoffsheim (1808&#150;1883) and his wife, Henrietta Goldschmidt. In 1855 Clara married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49024/', "Baron Maurice de Hirsch (otherwise Moritz von Hirsch) (1831&#150;1896)")</script>, a distant relative whose family were bankers to the Bavarian royal court, and who in 1850 had entered the Brussels office of her father's business, Bischoffsheim and Goldschmidt, where she acted as secretary and adviser. Her father was deeply immersed in Jewish affairs, becoming in time a member of the central committee of the Alliance Isra&eacute;lite Universelle, formed in Paris in 1860 as an international agency to protect Jewish interests worldwide. Clara de Hirsch was thus able to engage her husband in Jewish philanthropic work while he proceeded to amass a vast fortune as a banker on his own account. In time this wealth secured for him an entr&eacute;e into the circle of Edward, prince of Wales, of whom he became a very close friend and racing companion.<br>
<br>Maurice de Hirsch was antipathetic to territorial Zionism, regarding the notion of the re-establishment of a Jewish state as fantastic. But he was prepared to believe that the Jews had a future as an agricultural people, and, under Clara's influence, became increasingly drawn to the financing of schemes of agricultural resettlement. He made regular large donations to the Alliance in support of its work in the Middle East, and invested heavily in Jewish educational and welfare schemes in Austria. His donations to London hospitals were prodigious. In 1888 the Baron de Hirsch Foundation was established to further educational reforms among Jews living in Galicia and the Bukovina, and in 1891 the Baron de Hirsch Fund was established in New York to facilitate the settlement of immigrants in the USA and later Canada. But these benefactions were dwarfed by his establishment, in 1891, through a donation of &pound;2.4 million, of the Jewish Colonization Association; based in London, the mission of the association was to relieve the plight of oppressed Russian Jewry by promoting the movement of Jews from Russia first to Argentina, but later to Canada, Brazil, Cyprus, Turkey, and&#151;ultimately&#151;Palestine.<br>
<br>Contemporary observers all agreed that it was Clara who provided the stimulus for these charitable works, many of which were her brainchildren, though executed in the name of her husband. But the couple had a tragic domestic life. Their only daughter died in infancy and their only son, Lucien, born in 1856, died of pneumonia in 1887. Clara and Maurice de Hirsch seemed to have turned instinctively to ever greater acts of philanthropy as a way of filling the void thus created in their lives. Clara de Hirsch made many charitable donations in her own right, notably to the Pasteur Institute and Paris University. On Maurice's death in 1896 she became the sole administrator of his estate, making charitable disbursements totalling &pound;3 million; by the terms of her will a further &pound;2 million were donated for the endowment of a variety of philanthropic causes, including the Jewish Board of Guardians in London.<br>
<br>In 1898, by order of the Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, Clara de Hirsch was appointed to the order of Elizabeth. As her death approached, she adopted Maurice's two illegitimate male offspring as her own children, successfully petitioning the emperor to confer Maurice's barony upon the elder of the bastard sons, the Oxford-educated Maurice; on his death in 1912 the title passed to his younger brother, Raymond (<i>d</i>. 1968), a close friend of Winston Churchill and Liberal MP for West Ham North from 1911 to 1918.<br>
<br>Clara died of cancer at her Paris home on 1 April 1899 and was buried, two days later, beside her husband in the family vault in the Montmartre cemetery. The presence of the British, Austrian, Belgian, and Italian ambassadors to France at her funeral reflected the esteem in which she was held in these countries. In London the chief rabbi, Hermann Adler, conducted (at the Jewish convalescent home she had endowed in Hampstead) a special memorial service, a remarkable act of homage to a lady who was never, in fact, a British citizen.<br>
