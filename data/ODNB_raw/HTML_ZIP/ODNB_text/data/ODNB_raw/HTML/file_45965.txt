<span class="headword">Titchener,  Edward Bradford</span>  (1867&#150;1927), <span class="occ">experimental psychologist</span>, was born on 11 January 1867 in Little London, Chichester, Sussex, the son of John Bradford Titchener, railway clerk, and his wife, Alice Field Habin. Titchener obtained successive scholarships to Malvern College (1881) and Brasenose College, Oxford (1885), where he took a first in classical moderations (1887) and a first in classics (1889) before taking a further year's research studentship in physiology. During this period he discovered Wilhelm Wundt, the Leipzig-based German founder of experimental psychology, some of whose work he translated (though did not publish). Oxford being unsupportive of such interests he went to Leipzig in 1890 where he gained his PhD in 1892. Here he met such fellow doctoral students, and subsequently eminent psychologists, as the Americans E. W. Scripture, F. Angell, L. Witmer, and H. C. Warren, and the Germans O. K&uuml;lpe and E. Meumann. Titchener's doctoral research concerned reaction times and perception. In 1892, after a term spent teaching biology at Oxford, he emigrated to Cornell University in the United States, initially as director of the psychology laboratory; he was then Sage professor of psychology from 1895 to 1910. There he remained, returning to Europe only for the 1896 Munich International Congress of Psychology. In 1894 he married Sophie Kellogg Bedlow, of Portland, Maine, who assisted his work in various ways thereafter; they had three daughters and a son. Titchener was professor in charge of music at Cornell (1896&#150;8) and Sage professor of psychology in the graduate school from 1910.<br>
<br>While Wundt's numerous American students usually abandoned both his methods and his concept of psychology, Titchener professed to remain loyal, casting himself as Wundt's leading apostle in the United States. It is, however, now generally agreed that Titchener's position actually diverged profoundly from the German pioneer's, his elementism, empiricism and positivism markedly differing from Wundt's neo-idealism. He did, though, successfully emulate Wundt's academic style. Titchener saw his task as being threefold. The first was to translate key German works, most importantly Wundt's <span class="italic">Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology</span> (1894, with J. E. Creighton) and <span class="italic">Physiological Psychology</span> (1902, the first six chapters of the fifth edition), and K&uuml;lpe's <span class="italic">Outlines of Psychology</span> (1895). Second he produced a laboratory teaching manual, <span class="italic">Experimental Psychology: a Manual of Laboratory Practice</span>, which appeared in 1901&#150;5 (two volumes each on qualitative and quantitative methods, the pairs comprising students' and instructors' manuals). Widely used even among those otherwise unsympathetic to Titchener, these were important in consolidating the scientific character of psychology courses. <span class="italic">A Primer of Psychology</span> (1898), <span class="italic">A Text-Book of Psychology</span> (1910), and <span class="italic">A Beginner's Psychology</span> (1915) were also primarily pedagogic. Third he needed to state his theoretical position, which he termed &#145;structuralism&#146;, expounding this in <span class="italic">An Outline of Psychology</span> (1896), <span class="italic">Lectures on the Elementary Psychology of Feeling and Attention</span> (1908), and <span class="italic">Systematic Psychology: Prolegomena</span> (posthumously published in 1929). Especially influential were two <span class="italic">Philosophical Review</span> papers, &#145;The postulates of structural psychology&#146; (1896) and &#145;Structural and functional psychology&#146; (1899), which were responses to John Dewey's &#145;The reflex arc concept in psychology&#146; (<span class="italic">Psychological Review</span>, 1896). <span class="italic">A Text-Book of Psychology</span> is, however, the only thorough single volume account of his position. Titchener's journal publications, both experimental and theoretical, exceeded 200. An insightful critique of the psychological research of the 1898 Cambridge anthropological expedition to the Torres Strait identified many problems in conducting research beyond the laboratory (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</span>, 1916). He was the American editor of <span class="italic">Mind</span> between 1894 and 1920 and from 1921 to 1925 he edited the <span class="italic">American Journal of Psychology</span> but his productivity, which had been declining since 1909, almost ceased after 1920. He was awarded a DSc Oxford (1906), LLD Wisconsin (1904), DLitt Clark (1909), and DSc Harvard (1909). Always a collector of curious artefacts, he turned in later years to numismatics (in which he became quite expert).<br>
<br>For Titchener, psychology was the science of mind (as opposed to behaviour), the nature of conscious states being its immediate subject matter. Its initial task was to analyse consciousness into constituent elements, rather than study how it operates or how the elements interact. These latter must wait until the elements themselves have been identified. This analysis was a pure scientific endeavour with no immediate practical consequences. It could be undertaken only by rigorously trained introspection, avoiding stimulus error (confusing the properties of the conscious experience with those of the stimulus object itself). Doing this properly was an acquired professional skill. By 1915 German Gestalt psychologists were effectively challenging the clarity of this distinction.<br>
<br>A fine lecturer, and combining independent mindedness with personal charm, Titchener occupied a respected place in American psychology, but his intellectual isolation became acute and relations with the American Psychological Association were chequered. First functionalism, then behaviourism and psychoanalysis overshadowed structuralism. Moreover, the very rationality, even possibility, of scientific introspection was called into doubt. The notion of pure private sensations unmodified by the introspector's concepts and expectations, <i>and</i> capable of being unambiguously verbally reported, grew ever more dubious on numerous philosophical, theoretical, and methodological grounds. Additionally, Titchener's self-conscious combination of traditional English demeanour and autocratic German academic style did not help his cause, however much they reinforced his personal charisma. Perhaps a further factor was that such experiments were, as William James observed in <span class="italic">Principles of Psychology</span> (1890), extremely dull.<br>
<br>Titchener's former student E. G. Boring became psychology's leading historian in the United States. This requires additional comment. His highly influential <span class="italic">History of Experimental Psychology</span> (1929, revised 1950) cast Wundt and Titchener in central heroic roles, and Titchener's canonical eminence is in part due to Boring's advocacy. From the late 1960s historians also argued that Boring's version of Wundt's original position reflected distortions of it made by Titchener. A major figure among those who created scientific academic psychology in the United States during the 1890s and early 1900s, Titchener's own version was always anomalous there, despite his indefatigable and sophisticated expositions and defences of it. In Britain his textbooks initially enjoyed a certain popularity, some early British psychologists not entirely lacking sympathy, but such influence rapidly waned after about 1920. Titchener's home was at Ithaca, New York state; he died suddenly on 3 August 1927.<br>
