<span class="headword">Wilford, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1610), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the third son of Thomas Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1553) of Hartridge, Kent, merchant and landowner, and his second wife, Rose, daughter of William Whetenhall of Peckham. His elder half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29406/', "Sir James Wilford (b. in or before 1517, d. 1550)")</script>, had a distinguished military career. Like him, Wilford was brought up as a soldier, but nothing is known of his education. He was a beneficiary of his brother's will.<br>
<br>Wilford was a committed protestant and went into exile with his brother James Wilford during Mary I's reign. They both signed the &#145;new discipline&#146; at Frankfurt am Main in 1557. Wilford was appointed captain of Camber Castle, Sussex, in 1566 and was much involved in politics and administration in Winchelsea, Sussex, between 1566 and 1572. He was MP for the borough in 1571 and 1572. In 1573, already an experienced soldier, he acted as the marshal for the expedition undertaken by Walter Devereaux, first earl of Essex, during the ill-fated attempt to establish a plantation in co. Antrim. The expedition was strongly opposed by the local Irish chief, Brian mac Phelim O'Neill, and it was largely due to the experience and courage of Wilford that it survived the winter. His outstanding service to the force was acknowledged by Essex.<br>
<br>Wilford was a strong advocate of English intervention in the Low Countries, and wrote to his protestant patrons, Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, and Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, on the subject. He was captain of a cavalry company at Ostend in 1585, one of many English officers and men serving in the Low Countries before Leicester's &#145;official&#146; expedition was sanctioned by the treaty of Nonsuch in August 1585. Leicester reorganized the structure of the English troops, removed Wilford from the official payroll, and transferred him to the payroll of the states general. This caused him acute financial hardship, from which he had not recovered five years later. He was garrison sergeant-major of Ostend in 1586. On Leicester's departure, he served his successor, Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby, was made sergeant-major of the entire English force in the Netherlands in 1587, and was appointed a member of the council of war in December 1587 and sergeant-major of the field in February 1588. Willoughby frequently followed his advice. He played a prominent part in the successful defence of Bergen op Zoom, which was attacked in September 1588. Willoughby knighted Wilford for his distinguished service during the siege.<br>
<br>Early in 1589 Wilford was sent to England to report to the privy council on the problems that Willoughby was facing. Sir John Norris bemoaned his absence because he felt that Wilford would be more able to persuade Willoughby to release soldiers for the Portuguese expedition. In September 1589 Wilford was appointed high marshal of the expedition to support Henri of Navarre in Normandy, with Willoughby as commander. He was also colonel of the Kent regiment. The force landed at Dieppe and marched to support Henri at Paris. It supported Henri throughout November and December and played a key part in the capture of Vend&ocirc;me, Le Mans, and Alen&ccedil;on. During the siege of Alen&ccedil;on on 5 December 1589, Wilford devised an engine that utilized an iron hook to pull down the drawbridge of one of the defensive ravelins defending the town. He then led the assault force into the work and slaughtered the garrison of thirty-four men. The town surrendered the next day, claiming they feared the English behind them more than the French in front of them.<br>
<br>Wilford joined the debate about the correct strategy for opposing a Spanish invasion force, and rejected the notion proposed by Thomas Digges that every landing site should be held and defended with fieldworks and troops. He favoured concentrating forces for an effective counter-attack, and rebutted Digges's work line by line in <span class="italic">A military discourse whether it be better for England to give an invader present battle or to temporise and defer the same</span>.<br>
<br>After Wilford's return from Normandy his finances appear to have been gradually restored and he became heavily involved in the military administration of Kent. He was appointed the deputy lieutenant of the county in October 1589 and, in addition to taking responsibility for the county musters, he superintended the admiralty works at Dover harbour in 1590&#150;91. He was JP for Kent from about 1592. He became the governor of Camber Castle in 1593. In July 1595 he was commissioned to exercise martial law in the county, with the draconian power to arrest and summarily execute vagrants and others. In 1597 Wilford was commissioned to survey the castles of the downs, which guarded the sheltered anchorage behind the Goodwin Sands, Kent, following an invasion scare, and in August 1599 was appointed one of the sergeant-majors of the force planned to meet a further invasion threat.<br>
<br>On 17 March 1595 Wilford was admitted as a member of Lincoln's Inn. He died intestate at his manor of Hedding, Kent, on 10 November 1610 and was probably buried there. He had married Mary, the only daughter of Edward Poynings, who had been killed during the defence of Boulogne in January 1546. They had three sons, including Sir Thomas Wilford (who succeeded him and married Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Sir Edwin Sandys), and a daughter.<br>
