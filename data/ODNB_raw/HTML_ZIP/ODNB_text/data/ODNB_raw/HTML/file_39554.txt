<span class="headword">Stuart,  Janet Erskine</span>  (1857&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun</span>, was born at the rectory, Cottesmore, Rutland, on 11 November 1857, the last of six children born to Godfrey Andrew Stuart (<i>d</i>. 1889), rector of Cottesmore and canon of Peterborough, and his second wife, Mary Penelope Noel (<i>d</i>. 1859). When she was just over a year old her mother died, and Stuart found a substitute mother in her half-sister, Theodosia, who died of tuberculosis nineteen years later.<br>
<br>Stuart was educated at home by a succession of Swiss and German governesses. One of these, the daughter of Rinz von B&uuml;rger, a prominent theologian, introduced Stuart to contemporary German philosophy and theology. Such reading led her to religious scepticism, but she nevertheless played the part of the rector's daughter. She taught Sunday school and took a keen interest in the local tenantry, acquiring a thorough knowledge of livestock and botany.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty Stuart made the acquaintance of her Noel relatives, who had inherited the Gainsborough title and moved to nearby Exton Manor. This family had recently converted to Roman Catholicism and Stuart developed a strong attraction to the dogma and liturgy of the Catholic church. Through the Noels she met Elizabeth Ross, who in turn introduced her to the Jesuit Peter Gallwey. On 6 March 1879 she was received into the Roman Catholic church at the Jesuit Church of the Immaculate Conception (Farm Street) in London. For the next three years she made her home in London with Elizabeth Ross, travelling often and enjoying hunting and fishing. A turning point came in July 1882 when Stuart made a retreat under Father Gallwey at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Roehampton. Two months later she entered the Society of the Sacred Heart, receiving the habit on 13 November 1882 and pronouncing vows two years later.<br>
<br>Stuart's ability singled her out from the start, and while still a novice she was called upon to act as secretary to Mother Mabel Digby, vicaress of the English houses. Though still engaged in her own spiritual and intellectual formation Stuart began to teach in the school and soon gave classes to her fellow sisters in the juniorate. She was also sent to the mother house in Paris to make her probation and profession two years before the customary time. On her return to Roehampton in February 1889 Stuart was appointed councillor, and was given charge of the noviciate in 1892. In August 1894, when Mother Digby was elected assistant-general (and nine months later superior-general of the Society), Stuart replaced her as vicaress and superior at Roehampton. In 1898 she accompanied Mother Digby on a visitation of the North American houses of the society and three years later was sent as visitor to the Latin American houses.<br>
<br>Concern for the individual characterized both Mother Stuart's educational philosophy and her exercise of religious authority. As novice mistress she impressed upon her charges the necessity of personal development. In an age which favoured cutting novices to a pattern she abhorred copies, even of the best models. To a novice who was modelling herself rather too self-consciously on a canonized Jesuit, Stuart said &#145;Drop John Berchmans, sister, and be yourself&#146;  (Monahan, 81). Eager to further the educational values of the Society, Mother Stuart devoted much effort to developing Sacred Heart schools and colleges in England. She summed up her educational philosophy in <span class="italic">The Education of Catholic Girls</span>, published by Longman in 1911, and in her study <span class="italic">The Society of the Sacred Heart</span>, which went to press just after her death. Two volumes of essays and one of poetry were also published posthumously, and her <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, edited by Mother Maud Monahan, went through sixteen impressions.<br>
<br>Following Mother Digby's death in May 1911, Stuart was elected mother-general. During the four years which remained to her she visited almost every house of the Sacred Heart Society, not only those in Europe and the Americas but also houses in Australia and New Zealand, as well as those more recently established in China and Japan. Reports of her visits make it clear that she was greeted with enthusiasm by her sisters. Her journeyings produced a voluminous travel correspondence. Keenly observant, nothing escaped her pen: astronomical and climatic changes, exotic flora and fauna, local customs and peoples are all described with verve and wit.<br>
<br>Stuart's generalate was all too short; arriving back at the mother house at Ixelles in July 1914 it was apparent that she was seriously ill. Soon after the start of the First World War the general administration of the society left Belgium for Roehampton, and it was there, after unsuccessful surgery for cancer, that she died on 21 October 1914 and was buried on 30 October.<br>
