<span class="headword">Peart,  Charles</span>  (1759&#150;1798), <span class="occ">sculptor and wax modeller</span>, was born on 22 December 1759 at English Newton, Monmouth. In 1778 he exhibited three wax models at the Royal Academy, from Mr Abington's, Paulin Street, Hanover Square, and showed portraits, made exclusively in this medium until 1782. In 1781 he entered the Royal Academy Schools as a sculptor, where the following year he was awarded a gold medal for a model, <span class="italic">Hercules and Omphale</span>.<br>
<br>Some time after leaving the RA Schools, Peart went to work as an assistant to the sculptor John Charles Lochee (<i>b</i>. 1751), who was employed by Wedgwood. The great manufacturer employed Lochee to model plaques from the collection of gems at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, in 1787. Peart too was at Stowe in 1788, where he seems to have been employed, independent of his former master, by Wedgwood. In a letter written directly to Wedgwood's agent, Mr Bierly, Peart apologized for the delay in completing the modelling he had been commissioned to carry out, apparently in conjunction with the history and decorative painter Vincenzo Valdr&eacute; (<i>c</i>.1742&#150;1814), as an earlier assignment and the &#145;marquis's&#146; desire to take Valdr&eacute; to Ireland with him in August, necessitated that they &#145;work 14 Hours in a Day and which Sir, at present puts it quite out of my power to attend to anything else&#146;  (2 June 1788, Trustees of the Wedgwood Museum, Barlaston, Staffordshire). Peart, like Lochee, modelled a number of portraits for Wedgwood, including those of Lord Hillsborough and William Chambers.<br>
<br>Peart showed regularly at the Royal Academy throughout his life, from 1793 from a studio in New Road, close to the chief stoneyards. His exhibits from the late 1780s demonstrate a move towards larger scale, more monumental work and included designs for monuments, allegorical and classical friezes, and portrait busts. One of his first large commissions may have been obtained through the influence of his wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1770/71), whose sister's husband, Mr Woodcock, worked for the East India Company. The monument to Lieutenant-Colonel John Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1784), erected in St Thomas's Cathedral, Bombay, is conventional in its design, with life-size figures of death and hope either side of an urn on a tall pedestal; the monument is signed, although the date and circumstances of the commission have yet to be established. In 1791 Peart received what was probably his most important commission, that of the monument to Joseph Moorhouse, a colonel in the company's coast artillery, who was killed at the storming of the Pettah Gate of Bangalore; his death was also commemorated in a painting by Robert Home of 1793. Commissioned by the court of directors of the East India Company, following a general order of the Madras government in 1791, the monument in St Mary's Church, Madras, comprises a sarcophagus set on lion's feet (signed and dated by the sculptor, 7 March 1791) above which a relief portrait bust of Moorhouse, set in a medallion, is raised up by a cherub to the figure of Britannia to be crowned with a laurel.<br>
<br>The only other recorded monument by Peart is that to John Finch at Dudley, Worcestershire. In 1792 he carved a statue of Henry V for his home town of Monmouth (above the shire hall) and in 1793 carved a marble chimney-piece for the marquess of Buckingham's house in Pall Mall. In spite of these larger scale commissions, Peart appears to have continued to work for Wedgwood. A letter dated 14 July 1794, again to Bierly, asks the agent to remit &pound;20 on account, as &#145;at this time I have been laying in a large stock of stone to save the duty, which I am called on to pay of course immediately&#146;  (Trustees of the Wedgwood Museum, Barlaston, Staffordshire).<br>
<br>Peart died in 1798, leaving his widow with a young child. Farington records that in September 1799 Peart's affairs were not yet settled, but that Mrs Peart expected to receive little as he was &#145;much in arrears to the parish of St Pancrass having rec'd. money as Parish Officer&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.1281, 24 Sept 1799). She remarried in 1804.<br>
