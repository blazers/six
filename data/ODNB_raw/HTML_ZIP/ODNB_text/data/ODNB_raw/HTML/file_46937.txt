<span class="headword">Compton,  James</span>, third earl of Northampton  (1622&#150;1681), <span class="occ">playwright and translator</span>, was born on 19 August 1622, the eldest of the six sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6035/', "Spencer Compton, the second earl (1601&#150;1643)")</script>, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1654), daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6040/', "William Compton")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6032/', "Henry Compton")</script> were his brothers. In 1633 James entered Eton College, and in February 1636, while visiting Cambridge in the train of the young elector palatine, received the MA as <i>filius nobilis</i>. A year later he was admitted at Queens', where in 1615 his father had played before James I in Ruggles's comedy <span class="italic">Ignoramus</span>. His name appears below the only verse contribution from the college to the university's celebration of the birth of Princess Anne in 1637  (<span class="italic">Synodia</span>, sig. A3).<br>
<br>In September 1640 Compton was recalled from travel or military service in the Low Countries to stand as knight of the shire for Warwickshire. In April 1641 he voted against Strafford's attainder and the next year served as messenger between the parliament and Charles at York. Deprived of his seat after Edgehill, he fought at Hopton Heath (19 March 1643), where his father died, Cropredy Bridge (June 1644), and Banbury (October 1644), and in April 1645 was routed by Cromwell at Islip. He was present at Naseby in June, and after commanding 1500 horse in Wales retired to Oxford. In February 1646 he began the process of compounding, and his fine of &pound;21,455, reduced on appeal by one third  (BL, Add. MS 34253, fols. 42, 44), was discharged by December 1651. He later claimed to have lost &pound;50,000 in the wars, an early sacrifice being his library of some 250 books, confiscated in 1643 from Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate, and sold for &pound;57 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.  (TNA: PRO, SP 20/7, fols. 17&#150;20). In July 1647 he married Isabella (1622&#150;1661), younger daughter of Richard Sackville, third earl of Dorset (<i>d</i>. 1624), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5641/', "Lady Anne Clifford, then countess of Pembroke")</script>, who was active in promoting the match. They had six children, only one of whom, Alethea, survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>During the interregnum, when he was several times imprisoned, Northampton occupied his leisure by writing or translating plays and other works that lay unidentified in manuscript at his Northamptonshire seat of Castle Ashby until 1978 (BL, Add. MSS 60276&#150;60282). He was modest about his own literary talents, describing himself to his neighbour Lord Hatton in 1645 as one who had studied &#145;but slightly and truantlyke&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29570, fol. 30). Rugged translations of Seneca's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> and <span class="italic">Hercules furens</span>, which omit the choruses, may be early work (Add. MSS 60276, 60277). A taste for Italian literature, evident in his confiscated library, produced his best effort in this field, a racy adaptation of Machiavelli's comedy <span class="italic">La Mandragola</span>, relocated from Renaissance Florence to Commonwealth London (Add. MS 60278). His rendering of three scenes from <span class="italic">Don Sancho d'Aragon</span> (1649) into heroic verse makes him one of the earliest English translators of Corneille also (ibid.). The same impulse that moved him to translate the story of the martyred Christian convert Hermenegildus from the Latin (1620) of the Jesuit Nicholas Caussin led him to compose an original piece on the much handled subject of Mariamne, wife of Herod the Great (Add. MSS 60276, 60280). Altogether accomplished is his blank-verse drama on Leontias, king of Cyprus, in which a close acquaintance with Shakespeare is apparent. A five-act play on the usurper Caracalla and an unfinished draft of a drama about Strafford (Add. MS 60281) form a link with his few directly political writings which include a brief prose account of Charles I and two unfinished verse satires (Add. MSS 60282, 60276). In the 1650s and early 1660s Northampton acted as patron to actors and dramatists, and was the dedicatee of printed works by Samuel Holland, Henry Glapthorne, and William Heminges, as well as the recipient of three manuscript plays by his particular prot&eacute;g&eacute; Cosmo Manuche (Add. MSS 60273&#150;60275).<br>
<br>At the Restoration Northampton became lord lieutenant of Warwickshire and recorder of Coventry. Within three years of his first wife's death in 1661 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1719), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20230/', "Baptist Noel, third Viscount Campden")</script>, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. In May 1663 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society. He attended the House of Lords punctiliously until 1669, and sporadically thereafter, his most notable action there being the introduction in December 1667 of a bill calling for the perpetual banishment of Clarendon, which Pepys called &#145;mighty poor I think, and so doth everybody else&#146;. The last decade of his life saw a burst of public activity as privy councillor (1673&#150;9), constable of the Tower (1675&#150;9), and a lord of trade (1677). Northampton died at Castle Ashby on 15 December 1681 and was buried on 29 December at Compton Wynyates. Lely's portrait of him in armour was bequeathed as an heirloom to Ashby by his widow in 1719.<br>
