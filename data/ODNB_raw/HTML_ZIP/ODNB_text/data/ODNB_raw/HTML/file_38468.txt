<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Glasier,  John  Bruce</span>  (1859&#150;1920), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born (according to his accounts) on 25 March 1859 in Glasgow. He was the second of eight children of John Bruce of Irvine, a farmer and cattle dealer, and Isabella McNicoll of Shiskine, Arran, daughter of Alexander McNicoll, fisherman, crofter, and Gaelic poet. Bruce had left his wife and family to live with the much younger Isabella, so John Bruce Glasier, his brother, and six sisters were all born out of wedlock.<br>
<br>John Bruce Glasier grew up in the Ayrshire countryside, herding sheep and reading Burns's poetry, when not attending the parish school of Newton Ayr. After his father's death in December 1870, his mother adopted the surname Glasier (for reasons unknown). When Glasier was thirteen, she moved the family to Glasgow (where some of her relatives lived). This could have been to improve the employment prospects of her children. Glasier was soon apprenticed as an architectural draughtsman and his sisters entered office work. The family lived for several years at 250 Crown Street, near the Gorbals.<br>
<br>In Glasgow, Glasier initially came under the influence of his mother's uncle Neil Robertson. Robertson, a cabinet-maker, a strict Calvinist, and owner of a good collection of books, imbued his great-nephew with religious zeal: so much so, that Glasier at fourteen pledged himself to become a minister. However, Glasier's avid reading of Huxley and Darwin, as well as Burns, Byron, and Shelley, led him first to a crisis of faith and then to radical ideas.<br>
<br>Glasier was artistic by temperament. Like so many of his generation of socialist pioneers, he aspired to be a poet and long wrote verse. His architectural work gave way to work as a designer in ornamental ironwork. Like William Morris, he often spoke of the rights of men and women under socialism to enjoy and express themselves through art.<br>
<br>By the early 1880s Glasier was a notable advocate in Glasgow of land nationalization and socialism. He spoke at numerous radical and literary meetings as well as on soapboxes on Glasgow Green. His early socialism was fiery, even revolutionary. It drew on his experiences of being unemployed and on his reading. He and his friend Shaw Maxwell joined the Land League after hearing Michael Davitt speak in Glasgow in December 1879. Maxwell edited, and Glasier wrote for, a Glasgow Land League newspaper. Later, they both joined the Scottish Land Restoration League, and attended the inaugural meeting held by Henry George in Glasgow in February 1884. In the summer of 1884 Glasier was a founder member of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF).<br>
<br>Throughout his life Glasier was influenced by hero-figures. After Davitt came William Morris, and then Keir Hardie. Glasier was entranced when he heard Morris speak in Edinburgh and Glasgow in November 1884. When Morris and his associates left the SDF and founded the Socialist League, Glasier became secretary of its Glasgow branch, a post he held until 1889, when he moved to Alloa to work in a foundry. Glasier preached an ethical and Utopian socialism, and about this time, like Morris, was influenced by the anarchist ideas of Prince Kropotkin. He wrote much for Morris's newspaper <span class="italic">Commonweal</span>. In these years and later Glasier looked the part of the romantic politician, the vagabond poet, or the Pre-Raphaelite aesthete. After the disintegration of the Socialist League, Glasier remained a nominal member of Morris's Hammersmith Socialist Society, but otherwise resumed his role of lone socialist propagandist until he joined the Independent Labour Party in late 1893. On 21 June 1893 he married Katharine St John Conway [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42338/', "Glasier, Katharine St John Bruce (1867&#150;1950)")</script>]. The Glasiers were to be an effective socialist partnership. Unlike the Webbs, the Glasiers had children: Jeannie, Malcolm, and John Glendower.<br>
<br>For much of the Independent Labour Party's first twenty-five years Glasier was one of its &#145;Big Four&#146; leaders, along with Keir Hardie, James Ramsay MacDonald, and Philip Snowden. He served on the party's national administrative council from 1897 to 1909, when the Big Four resigned over the annual conference's failure to back them fully in a dispute concerning Victor Grayson, and again from 1910 to 1919. Glasier succeeded Hardie as party chairman (1900&#150;03). After editing <span class="italic">ILP News</span> for several years, he took on editing the <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span> (January 1905 &#150; April 1909) after Hardie sold the paper to the Independent Labour Party. Although sales rose from 13,000 to a peak of 43,000 in 1908, Glasier's editorship came under growing criticism, particularly for his proneness to defend the increasing pragmatism of the party's leadership. Stanley Pierson has commented that after 1900 Glasier's socialism &#145;lost much of its inspirational quality and became apologetic&#146;  (Pierson, <span class="italic">British Socialists</span>, 197).<br>
<br>Glasier was at his best as the socialist evangelist. He and his wife, Katharine, made very great financial and physical sacrifices for the socialist cause. The Glasiers' finances were rescued in 1909 by a trust fund of $15,000 set up for them by a wealthy Boston widow, Elizabeth Glendower Evans. Glasier rarely put himself forward for public office. He served as a Chapel-en-le-Frith parish councillor for a period from 1903, having, to his surprise, topped the poll. He stood unsuccessfully for Birmingham, Bordesley Green, in the 1906 general election. Otherwise, he stood aside and supported Hardie and, for a period, MacDonald. He attended the Second International's congresses from 1896 and delighted in opposing Marxists, both British and continental European. Like Hardie, Glasier condemned both the South African War and the First World War.<br>
<br>John Bruce Glasier suffered cancer of the bowel from 1915. After brave attempts to contain the disease by diet and by Christian Science, he became housebound in 1919. In his last months he wrote <span class="italic">The Meaning of Socialism</span> (1919) and <span class="italic">William Morris and the Early Days of the Socialist Movement</span> (1921) and compiled a collection of his verse, <span class="italic">On the Road to Liberty</span>. He died at 37 Windsor Road, Levenshulme, Lancashire, on 4 June 1920.<br>
