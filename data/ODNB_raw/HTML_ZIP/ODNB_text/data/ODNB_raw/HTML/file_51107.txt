<span class="headword">Joseph,  Morris David</span>  (1848&#150;1930), <span class="occ">Jewish minister and theologian</span>, was born on 28 May 1848 at 17 Green Street, Long Acre, London, one of the seven children (four girls and three boys) of David Joseph and his wife, Amelia Levi. The son of a schoolmaster who was also the minister of Maiden Lane Synagogue in central London, Morris Joseph spent his professional life as a member of the Jewish clergy, following a path which travelled from Orthodox to Progressive Judaism.<br>
<br>Joseph was educated at the Westminster Jews' Free School, a co-educational school located in the heart of London's Soho district. From there he graduated to Jews' College, a seminary which was established in 1855 following a proposal by the chief rabbi, Nathan Adler, for the setting up of a college where aspiring rabbis in Britain could receive the &#145;requisite theological and scholastic education and the necessary preparation for their future offices&#146;  (Lipman, 24). It was during his time at Jews' College, under the tutelage of the principal, Dr Michael Friedlander, that the young Joseph developed his love of learning. Following his period at the college Joseph&#151;who did not receive <i>semichah</i> (the ordination of rabbi)&#151;was appointed minister&#150;secretary to the newly established Orthodox North London Synagogue, situated in the comfortable working- and middle-class area of Barnsbury.<br>
<br>On 30 October 1872, while still at North London, Joseph married Frances Amelia Henry (1851&#150;1914), daughter of Michael Henry, a merchant, the marriage ceremony being performed by Chief Rabbi Adler. Two years later Joseph took up the post of minister to the Orthodox, though progressive, Old Hebrew Congregation of Liverpool, which had just moved to its newly opened synagogue in the city's Princes Road. A previous incumbent of the post had been David Woolf Marks, who in 1841 left Liverpool to become first minister of the newly created West London Synagogue of British Jews. Joseph was to follow in Professor Marks's footsteps yet again when, in 1893, he was appointed senior minister of west London when Marks stepped down. It was while at Liverpool that Joseph developed the oratorical and intellectual skills for which he became renowned. Sadly his term in office in Liverpool was cut short. In 1881 he was forced to return to London and enter into semi-retirement due to ill health. But these were no years in the wilderness: he wrote regularly for the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> and taught homiletics at Jews' College, while freedom from the demands of clerical office enabled him to sit back and examine his beliefs and determine his future direction.<br>
<br>By 1890, fully restored to good health, Joseph was eager to re-enter his chosen profession. He began by arranging religious services for those Jews who had moved to the rarefied and intellectual middle-class pastures of Hampstead in north-west London, an area at that time void of synagogues. He organized a series of sabbath afternoon services which began at 3 p.m. at the Town Hall, Broadhurst Gardens, West Hampstead; these attracted Jews of all shades of opinion. Joseph tried to combat the growth of religious apathy within the Jewish community, many members of which perceived Orthodox Judaism as medieval and the cause of gradual intellectual alienation. He recognized that there was a need to inject spiritual uplift into the services while at the same time bowing to progress, although he stopped short of accepting the suggestion of a shared Christian&#150;Jewish service.<br>
<br>It was Joseph's modernism, his concern about the &#145;melting away&#146;  (Joseph, ix), and his support for the use of instrumental music at sabbath services that determined his future and the appointment which was to be his for the remainder of his active life. In 1892 an Orthodox synagogue was opened in Hampstead. It was a foregone conclusion that Joseph would apply for, and be appointed to, the position of minister. However, his published views, which were at variance with traditional Judaism, resulted in the new chief rabbi, Hermann Adler, refusing to sanction the appointment. The rejection coincided with the semi-retirement of David Woolf Marks, now senior minister of the West London Synagogue of British Jews. Joseph was encouraged to apply for the post at the same time as a collection of his Saturday afternoon service sermons was published under the title <span class="italic">The Ideal in Judaism</span> (1893). In the volume Joseph's beliefs in a return to Israel without the restoration of the sacrifices and that the &#145;Messiah is always moving amongst us&#146; received a public airing, as did his conviction that &#145;True religion is reason&#146;. While the collection of sermons was favourably reviewed by the national press and an article in the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> pronounced the sermons to be powerful aids to devotional faith and practical Judaism, the members of the West London Synagogue reacted to the publication with mixed feelings. Some were approving but others were sceptical, stating that the sermons were &#145;interesting but not Jewish&#146;  (Kershen and Romain, 112&#150;13). However, when the other contender for the position, the Revd Simeon Singer, dropped out of the running these concerns were overruled and Joseph was appointed senior minister to the West London Synagogue of British Jews.<br>
<br>In his inaugural sermon Joseph called upon his congregants to &#145;be devoted to the principles of enlightened religion&#146;. He also stated his intention to narrow the rift between Reform and Orthodox Jewry which had been a distressing facet of the Jewish community's life for the past fifty years (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 15 September 1893). That he achieved this latter aim was manifest when, in 1911, he was given the honour of delivering the <i>hesped</i> (memorial sermon) at Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler's funeral.<br>
<br>Joseph served west London as senior minister until 1925, during which time he earned a reputation as a &#145;forceful and lucid preacher&#146; who was &#145;no orator in the ordinary sense&#146; but a man whose sermons were &#145;literary gems&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 25 April 1930). These sermons were published in a series of volumes: <span class="italic">The Ideal in Judaism</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Judaism as a Creed</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Message of Judaism</span> (1907), and <span class="italic">The Spirit of Judaism</span> (1930). In addition to the published volumes of sermons Joseph wrote articles for the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, and the <span class="italic">Hastings Encyclopaedia of Religion</span>, and translated the introduction to the <span class="italic">Rokeach</span> (a collection of medieval religious writings). Joseph also took a concerned interest in current affairs and to this end, in 1895, established the West London Synagogue Association as a &#145;religious and philanthropic Centre and as a forum for debate of topical issues&#146;  (Kershen and Romain, 124).<br>
<br>Joseph personified the Englishman who followed the Mosaic religion. He was determined that immigrant eastern European Jews should become part of the mainstream as rapidly as possible; indeed he saw it as their duty to do so. In the same way he was totally opposed to the concept of political Zionism, and &#145;abhorred the notion of a nationalist Jewish state&#146;  (Kershen and Romain, 116). Anti-Zionism created strange bedfellows: Chief Rabbi Adler and the Revd Morris Joseph joined forces to attack pro-Zionists at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London. In addition to his anti-Zionist beliefs Joseph was a pacifist and chairman of the Jewish Peace Society. He was also a member of the executive committee of the League of Religions and sat on the council of the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund.<br>
<br>Joseph retired from the West London Synagogue in 1925, aged seventy-seven. He lived for a further five years and though denied the pleasure of grandchildren, as he and his wife were childless, he was cared for by devoted nieces and nephews, his wife having died in 1914. He died at his home, 11 Gloucester Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 17 April 1930 from carcinoma of the bladder, and was buried on 21 April at the Golders Green Jewish cemetery, Middlesex. He was remembered as &#145;a scholar in the finest sense of the word&#146;, as a &#145;lover of peace&#146;, and &#145;a man of optimism whose oratory was most outstanding&#146;. In his eulogy at the burial the Revd Vivian Simmons recalled how Joseph &#145;spoke often with the insight of a prophet &hellip; fired with the spirit of the greatest rabbis of old&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 23 April 1930).<br>
