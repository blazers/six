<span class="headword">Comyn,  Alexander</span>, sixth earl of Buchan  (<em>d.</em> 1289), <span class="occ">baron and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of William Comyn, earl of Buchan (<i>d</i>. 1233), and his second wife, Marjory, in her own right countess of Buchan. Alexander, who became earl of Buchan after his mother's death about 1244, was a member of a large family, with two brothers, William and Fergus, and three sisters: Elizabeth, who married William, earl of Mar; Idonea, who married Gilbert de la Hay; and Agnes, who married Philip Meldrum. He was also half-brother to: Richard; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6049/', "Walter Comyn, lord of Badenoch")</script>, who became earl of Menteith on his marriage to Isabella, daughter and heir of Maurice, earl of Menteith, in 1233 or 1234; William, a clerk; David, who married Isabel de Valognes, lady of East Kilbride; and Jean, who married William, earl of Ross.<br>
<br>Alexander Comyn's control over the earldom of Buchan was exercised through key castles at Kingedward, Dundarg (Aberdour), Cairnbulg (Philorth), Rattray, Slains, and Ellon. Ellon was the legal centre of the earldom; Deer Abbey (founded by his father <i>c</i>.1219) the religious centre; Kelly, with its enclosed park for hunting, the domestic centre; and Newburgh the main burgh. He also had considerable landed power outside Buchan, including a manor house on the banks of the River Tay, near Scone, lands in Fife, and Mortlach, which with its important castle of Balvenie, Banffshire, formed an important link with the lands of the Badenoch branch of the family. In addition, his marriage to Elizabeth, one of three daughters and coheirs of the great Anglo-Scottish magnate Roger de Quincy (<i>d</i>. 1264), brought him estates in Fife, Galloway, Dumfriesshire, and Lothian, as well as much land in England, especially in the midlands. Having bought the office of constable in 1274 or 1275, Earl Alexander also added the constable lands in Perth, Clackmannan, Inverness, and Cowie, near Stonehaven, to his landholding. He was thus one of the great Anglo-Scottish barons. He was not entirely an absentee landlord in England and appeared at Shepshed, his important administrative centre in the midlands, in 1282, but he conducted his English business chiefly through attorneys and increasingly through his sons John (in Leicestershire and Warwickshire) and Roger (in Northamptonshire). Earl Alexander's interests were essentially Scottish (and especially northern Scottish)&#151;his religious patronage included the foundation of two almshouses in Buchan (at Newburgh and Turriff) and benefactions to Deer Abbey, Arbroath, Lindores, Inchcolm, Scone, and St Andrews.<br>
<br>Alexander Comyn had appeared in the Scottish royal circle by 1240, and he was prominent in Comyn party activities under the leadership of his half-brother Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith, in the disturbed years 1242&#150;58, participating in the hounding of the Bissets, potential rivals in the north, between 1242 and 1244. Alexander II sought to curb the power which the Comyn party thus displayed by appointing Alan Durward to be justiciar of Scotia, an increasingly important office of state. The Durwards, too, were rivals of the Comyns in northern Scotland, and Alan's attempt to strengthen his political position during the minority of Alexander III after 1249 was regarded by the Comyns as a threat to their political leadership. However, the Comyns gained control of Scottish government in 1251 following the intervention of Henry III, and Earl Alexander's prominence in the Comyn party was shown by his appointment as justiciar of Scotia from 1253. He thus followed his father, who had held this office from <i>c</i>.1205 to 1233. After his removal from office, with the rest of the Comyn government, following an anti-Comyn coup in 1255, Earl Alexander participated in the Comyn counter-coup of 1257 and appeared again as justiciar of Scotia in the treaty made by Comyn supporters with the Welsh princes in 1258. He retained this office when a compromise government, made up of both Comyn and opposing elements, was established in 1258, and he remained one of the crown's leading advisers until his death in 1289. He also became the political leader of the Comyn party after Earl Walter of Menteith's death in 1258. Earl Alexander contributed greatly to the strengthening of royal authority in the south-west and north of the Scottish kingdom. He had a military role in 1263 against the Norwegian threat and contributed to the reorganization of royal control in the south-west and north, taking the offices of sheriff of Wigtown, sheriff of Dingwall, and baillie of Inverie (Knoydart) between 1263 and 1266, while in 1282 he was dispatched by Alexander III on important (though unspecified) business to the remote parts of the Scottish isles.<br>
<br>After 1258 Earl Alexander, who dominates witness lists to Alexander III's acts, was the leader of a responsible aristocratic community in effective support of the crown. In 1281 he participated in negotiations for the marriage between Alexander III's daughter, Margaret, and Erik, king of Norway, and in 1284 affirmed the recognition of the child of this marriage, the Maid of Norway, as Alexander III's heir presumptive. Following Alexander III's death in 1286, the earl, who had been involved in the minority of Alexander III and was behind plans for an emergency council in 1260&#150;61 when Queen Margaret went to England for her confinement, was the most experienced of the six guardians elected to govern the country on behalf of the absent Maid of Norway. Earl Alexander died in 1289, after 10 July. He had a large family, four sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6047/', "John Comyn (d. 1308)")</script>, his successor, who married Isabel, daughter of Colban, earl of Fife; Roger; Alexander, who married Joan Latimer; and Master William, provost of St Mary's, St Andrews&#151;and five daughters: Marjory (or Marjorie), who was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62217/', "Patrick Dunbar, seventh earl of Dunbar")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8206/', "Dunbar, Patrick, eighth earl of Dunbar or of March (1285&#150;1369)")</script>]; Emma, who was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26650/', "Malise Strathearn, earl of Strathearn")</script>; Elizabeth, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27988/', "Gilbert de Umfraville, earl of Angus")</script>; Elena, who was married to William Brechin; and another, married to Nicholas de Soulis.<br>
