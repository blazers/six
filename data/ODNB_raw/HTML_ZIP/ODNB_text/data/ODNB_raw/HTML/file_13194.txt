<span class="headword">Hibbert,  George</span>  (1757&#150;1837), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on 13 January 1757 in Manchester, the fifth son of Robert Hibbert, merchant, of Manchester, and his wife, Abigail, daughter of William Scholey of Leeds. His grandfather and father were prominent merchants in Manchester, and his uncle Thomas Hibbert was one of the leading planters and merchants in Jamaica. He was educated in Liverpool and at the Revd Booth's school in Woolton, Lancashire. With &pound;1500 from his father on coming of age, he moved to London in 1780 and became a junior partner in the West Indies house of Hibbert, Purrier, and Horton, at 9 Mincing Lane, which was headed by his elder brothers Thomas and Robert. On inheriting &pound;1000 at the death of his father, he married Elizabeth Margaret Fonnereau, daughter of Philip Fonnereau, on 30 August 1784. Together they raised five sons and nine daughters. During the 1780s and 1790s Hibbert pursued the work of his firm, by 1800 known as Hibberts, Fuhr, and Purrier and highly regarded in the Jamaica trade. In the 1790s he assumed direction of the firm. At the same time he and two brothers formed a separate partnership, which operated from the same address, but appears to have been more involved in finance. The former firm was concluded in 1815, but the latter survived his death.<br>
<br>At the age of forty Hibbert entered public service. He was elected an alderman of London in 1798 and served until 1803; most notably, he sided with the government by successfully backing a resolution in favour of a tax on property in 1798. The following year, he began his lifelong tenure as a director of the West India Dock Company. Several times chairman, he became the leading proponent, alongside Robert Milligan, of completing the new dock scheme. He manoeuvred for a seat in parliament in 1802, but to no avail; he was luckier in 1806, when he was selected without opposition for Seaford, Sussex. In the Commons, he took strong stands as a member of the opposition. He was most noted for his opposition to the abolition of the slave trade, which was memorialized in <span class="italic">The Substance of Three Speeches on the Abolition of the Slave Trade</span> (1807). By 1810 he had accepted the demise of the trade, and was calling for measures to end it in a more effective manner. In 1806, and again from 1807 to his retirement in 1812, he was parliament's principal West Indies supporter: he backed the continuation of the tax exemption on dividends for foreigners in 1808; he backed a ban on grain distillation in 1809; and he supported the provision of free labour from the East Indies to the West Indies in 1811. After his retirement from parliament in 1812, Hibbert acted as the agent for Jamaica until 1830, and headed the West India Committee as its chairman. In both capacities, he ardently argued the case of Caribbean planters and merchants.<br>
<br>Hibbert was also a renowned collector of paintings, sculpture, and books, and at his house in Clapham he brought together a unique collection of botanical exotica. In 1805 he helped to found the London Institution. In 1811 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and, the following year, a fellow of the Society of Arts. In 1819, as a member of the Roxburgh Club, he edited Caxton's translation of Ovid, <span class="italic">Six Books of Metamorphoses</span>. Later he edited the anonymous <span class="italic">Narrative of a Journey from Santiago de Chile to Buenos Ayres</span> (1824), and supported the publication of <span class="italic">Correspondence between George Hibbert, esq., and the Rev. T. Cooper, relative to the condition of the negro slaves in Jamaica</span> (1824). When his wife's uncle Rogers Parker died in 1828, he succeeded to Parker's Munden estate near Watford, to which he removed after auctioning off most of his art and library. He died there on 8 October 1837 and was buried at Aldenham.<br>
