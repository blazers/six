<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ridding <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Palmer]</span>, Lady  Laura Elizabeth</span>  (1849&#150;1939), <span class="occ">suffragist and philanthropist</span>, was born on 26 March 1849 at Harley Street, London, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21210/', "Roundell Palmer (1812&#150;1895)")</script>, later the first earl of Selborne, and his wife, Lady Laura Waldegrave (1821&#150;1885), the second daughter of William Waldegrave, eighth Earl Waldegrave. On 26 October 1876 she married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35750/', "Revd Dr George Ridding (1828&#150;1904)")</script>, who had been a widower for seventeen years. At that time he was headmaster of Winchester College; in 1884 he became the first bishop of Southwell. Their marriage was childless.<br>
<br>Laura Ridding was an advocate of women's suffrage for many years and was also involved in rescue work, temperance work, and nursing. In 1885 she and her husband founded Southwell House, a temporary rescue home for young women. She was also a member of a variety of committees and organizations: from 1895 to 1904 she was a poor-law guardian and rural district councillor for the Southwell union. In 1902 she was a member of the Nottinghamshire county education committee and in 1913 she joined the Hampshire county insurance committee. During the First World War she was active in a number of organizations: the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association; the Women's War Agricultural Committee; the YWCA Girls' Patriotic Club; and the Winchester Patrols.<br>
<br>One of Lady Laura's greatest achievements, however, was to establish, with Louise Creighton (1850&#150;1936) and Emily Janes (1846&#150;1928), among others, the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW) in 1895. This was an essentially conservative organization designed to co-ordinate women's philanthropic and charitable efforts throughout the country. From 1899 to 1910 Lady Laura was chair of the NUWW legislative committee. She also served on the executive committee and was vice-president before taking over as president in 1910. Her commitment to the NUWW was lifelong: although she did not attend London meetings after the First World War she was involved in her local Winchester branch up to her death in 1939.<br>
<br>All commentators on Lady Laura stress her intellectual ability: the writer of her obituary in <span class="italic">Women in Council</span>, who had worked with her on the NUWW legislative committee, felt that she &#145;had inherited her father's legal mind and brought a sound judgement to bear on all the problems that came before us. She had a delightful sense of humour and guided the Council with great skill, yet without imposing her will upon it&#146;. In addition, &#145;No point was too small to be of interest and her thoroughness was realised by all who worked with her&#146;. According to a piece in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, published the day after her funeral, she had &#145;a quick and ardent mind, full of interest and enthusiasm&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 May 1939). Lady Laura clearly had a lighter side&#151;<span class="italic">The Times</span> described her as &#145;a charming companion, an adoring wife, and a source of perpetual amusement&#146; to her husband. She had an artistic ability, which was demonstrated by her skill in painting and &#145;the taste with which she arranged and adorned her three homes&#146;. Despite a keen mind, she was decidedly emotional: her obituarist recalls &#145;her sympathy, her spontaneous gaiety, her affection for people and animals, her ready tears, her exaggerated apprehensions&#146;. She was also held to have &#145;exhibited unaccountable foibles, which seemed to enhance rather than disfigure an essentially kind and really interesting and powerful personality, as occasional grotesqueness enhances some of the greatest classical art&#146;. All her activities and characteristics were underpinned by a strong religious faith.<br>
<br>Lady Laura listed her recreations as gardening, the microscope, painting, the study of birds, and writing, and she was a member of the Ladies' Club in Winchester. Her publications included three biographies: of her husband, <span class="italic">George Ridding, schoolmaster and bishop, 43rd head of Winchester, 1866&#150;1884, first bishop of Southwell, 1884&#150;1904</span> (1908); of her nephew, Robert Palmer, who died in Mesopotamia in 1916, <span class="italic">The Life of Robert Palmer, 1888&#150;1916</span> (1921); and of her sister, Lady Sophia Palmer, who married the comte de Franqueville in 1903 and died in 1915. She was also an occasional contributor to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. After her husband's death in 1904, she bought the Old Rectory at Wonston, Sutton Scotney, Hampshire. It was there that she died on 22 May 1939 at the age of ninety. Although troubled by deafness, &#145;she retained her powers of mind unimpaired to the end&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 May 1939). She was buried in Southwell Minster on 26 May.<br>
