<span class="headword">Plott,  John</span>  (1732&#150;1803), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born at Winchester. He may have been the John Plot who was baptized on 11 November 1735 at the church of St Maurice, Winchester, the son of William Plot. In early life he was employed by an attorney, and in 1756 he acted as clerk of the accounts for the maintenance of French prisoners quartered near Winchester. Later that year he turned to art, and, after receiving some instruction in landscape from Richard Wilson, he became a pupil of Nathaniel Hone, whom he assisted in his miniatures and enamels. Plott practised miniature painting with success both in London and in Winchester, exhibiting with the Incorporated Society of Artists (of which he was a director in 1774) from 1764 to 1775, and at the Royal Academy from 1772 to the end of his life.<br>
<br>Plott painted miniatures on ivory and enamel and also executed larger portraits in oil. According to Foskett &#145;many of his miniatures are of a very high quality, and his work deserves more recognition than has hitherto been the case&#146;  (Foskett, 620). Plott's miniature of Miss Anne Locke, noted by Foskett as a fine example of his work, was exhibited in Edinburgh and is illustrated in Foskett's catalogue of the exhibition <span class="italic">British Portrait Miniatures</span> (1963). The Victoria and Albert Museum holds a miniature portrait by Plott of his aunt <span class="italic">Mrs Lydia Butt</span> (1776). A miniature of the Hon. Revd Shute Barrington, bishop of Llandaff, Salisbury, and Durham, attributed to Plott, was at Christies on 26 June 1980 (lot 54).<br>
<br>Having a taste for natural history Plott also executed a number of beautiful watercolour drawings of that kind, including a series for a projected work on land snails, which remained unfinished at his death. He was an intimate friend of the poet George Keate, and some of their correspondence was formerly in the possession of G. B. Henderson of Bloomsbury Place, London; it appears from one of the letters that Plott was twice a candidate for a librarianship in the British Museum, where engraved portraits after Plott's miniatures may be found. Plott painted a miniature of Keate, which was engraved by J. K. Sherwin as a frontispiece to <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of George Keate</span> (1781).<br>
<br>Four years before his death Plott became a member of the corporation of Winchester. He died at his sister's house at Stoke, Winchester, on 27 October 1803, aged seventy-one. A portrait of Plott, scraped in mezzotint by himself, is mentioned by Sir William Henry Bromley in his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Engraved British Portraits from Egbert the Great, to the Present Time</span> (1793) and in Musgrave's <span class="italic">Catalogue &hellip; of a collection of English portraits &hellip; which will be sold by auction by Mr Richardson</span> ([1800]), but is not otherwise known.<br>
