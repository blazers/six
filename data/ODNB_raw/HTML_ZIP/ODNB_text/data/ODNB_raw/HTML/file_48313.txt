<span class="headword">Eynsham,  Adam  of</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1155, <em>d.</em> in or after 1233), <span class="occ">abbot of Eynsham and hagiographer</span>, came from a middle-class Oxford family, and became a monk and then in due course first prior, and then abbot, of the Benedictine monastery at Eynsham. His father, Edmund, was a doctor who owned properties in Oxford (probably in the Osney district), but went to the Holy Land and died there <i>c</i>.1187. One of Adam's brothers, William of Oxford, is mentioned as the abbot's brother in Eynsham charters, and a younger brother, also called Edmund, had studied at Oxford and in 1196 experienced a vision of the next world. Adam wrote an account of this, <span class="italic">The Vision of the Monk of Eynsham</span>, which survives in several manuscripts and printed editions.<br>
<br>Eynsham is a rare English example of an abbey founded by the local bishop (Lincoln), who had the right of patronage. This right deeply affected Adam three times in his life. Hugh (bishop of Lincoln, 1186&#150;1200) successfully claimed it against the king in 1197, and Adam, prior or sub-prior during the vacancy caused by Abbot Godfrey's death in 1195, probably compiled the Eynsham cartulary for this lawsuit. In 1197 Robert, prior of Dover, became abbot and Hugh shrewdly chose Adam as his chaplain. From then until Hugh's death Adam was his companion and confidant, travelling with him in England, Anjou, and the Dauphin&eacute;. This experience enabled Adam to write the life of Hugh, one of the fullest and most trustworthy saints' lives of the middle ages. This work is Adam's principal title to fame. It is mainly through his portrait, although both idealized and selective, that Hugh can be known in such great detail today.<br>
<br>Adam completed this life after Hugh's death. Like many of the English clergy he went abroad during the interdict (1208&#150;13) under King John. He was certainly in Paris for some of this time. Hugh of Wells, bishop of Lincoln (1209&#150;35) returned to England in 1213 and exercised his right to preside over the election at Eynsham of a successor to Abbot Robert, who had died in 1208. Adam, whose research had earlier established the bishop of Lincoln's rights, was elected abbot and ruled for fifteen years.<br>
<br>Eynsham was never a very large monastery, but it was important for the many visitors who stayed there on the way to the west and to Wales, and it was frequently chosen by kings as the place for episcopal elections, which were held there while the king stayed in the palace at Woodstock. Such events were inevitably expensive for the monastery. While Adam was abbot, the monks incurred another expense, that of providing 52<i>s</i>., as well as a meal, for 200 poor (clerical) students each year. This had been imposed on the town of Oxford, in reparation for the townspeople's having killed some student clerics in a riot in 1209, by the papal legate Nicol&ograve; of Tusculum. The town, it seems, persuaded Eynsham to provide this annual sum in return for a cash or property payment. Although Eynsham owned considerable estates (including woodlands, which Adam had cut wastefully), the abbey had fallen into debt under Abbot Godfrey, and by 1227 it owed &pound;152 15<i>s</i>. to David the Jew of Lincoln. This they managed to repay on 29 June of that year, but in 1228 Adam, now an old man, was deposed by the bishop of Lincoln, Hugh of Wells (again exercising his powers over a &#145;bishop's monastery&#146;), as a &#145;manifest dilapidator&#146; of monastic property. This needs to be considered in the context of widespread monastic financial problems at this time, and of the claims of communities to exercise more control over spending, not to mention the interdict and royal exactions. On the other hand, it may be that Adam, although a good scholar in the monastic tradition, was a poor administrator. His abbatial seal survives.<br>
<br>After his retirement he lived in the manor of Little Rollright and witnessed charters. In 1233 he was exempted from doing suit for the manor, and presumably died soon afterwards. From his writings, composed just when Oxford schools were developing into a university, Adam emerges as one well read in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the fathers who was also a keen and articulate observer of events, people (including three Angevin kings), and even animals (such as the swan of St Hugh of Lincoln), and as one who tellingly depicted the weak and the strong aspects of twelfth-century church life.<br>
