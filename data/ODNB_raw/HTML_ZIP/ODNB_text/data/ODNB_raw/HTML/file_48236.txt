<span class="headword">Pilling,  Richard</span>  (1799&#150;1874), <span class="occ">hand-loom weaver and Chartist</span>, was born on 15 December 1799 in Bolton, Lancashire, the son of a cotton weaver. He started work around ten years of age during the boom of the French wars. He was then, he claimed, able to earn 16<i>s</i>. a week. In the post-war depression and with the decline of hand-loom weaving, however, his wages dropped sharply. By the early 1830s, although a married man with young children, he was earning only 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for a full working week. In 1833 he took work in a cotton mill as a power-loom weaver.<br>
<br>Like many of his contemporaries Pilling took part in the post-war movement for parliamentary reform; he later claimed that he missed the Peterloo massacre by a shade, since his contingent was warned of the trouble before they arrived at the meeting-place. He was among the agitators for the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, and soon after his entry into the factory became a leading member of the power-loom weavers' trade society. He was already by then an organizer and speaker for the Ten Hours Movement, which advocated a ten-hour day in the factories. The aim was ostensibly to protect the child and female workers, but also, as was generally admitted, to put a legal restraint on the hours of factory work for all employees.<br>
<br>In the years immediately following the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, Pilling lived and worked in Stockport. With fellow trade unionists he organized resistance to wage reductions and to the dismissal of trade society organizers and members. He was concerned with local and national agitation, both among Stockport ratepayers and in the national movement of protest against the sentence of transportation passed on the committee of the Glasgow Cotton Spinners' Union early in 1838. He was a founder member of the Stockport Chartist Working Men's Association in 1838 and from that time onwards appeared regularly on the platform at public meetings of the radicals and Chartists. He was arrested for his activities in the summer of 1839. After his arrest Pilling showed a good understanding of the judicial system. Although unable to find the high sureties demanded, he was still able to exercise his right to traverse and to be released on his own recognizances until the next assizes. The conditions of his release do not seem to have prevented him from taking an active part in Chartist activities during the winter of 1839&#150;40. At the Chester assizes in April 1840 he was discharged; the terms of his discharge do not seem to have inhibited him in the least, as he was soon engaged in organizing an eight-week strike of Stockport power-loom weavers against a wage reduction.<br>
<br>As the result of his part in the strike Pilling and his family were blacklisted by Stockport employers and moved to Ashton under Lyne in search of work. By this time Pilling and his wife, Elizabeth (whom he had married in the early 1820s), had seven children, of whom the three oldest were able to get factory work. Wages continued to be reduced, and early in 1842 the second son, James, had to leave his work as he was suffering from tuberculosis, from which he died shortly afterwards. In the summer of 1842 a threatened general reduction of wages led to a series of strikes in the cotton districts, which escalated into the general turnout which became known as the &#145;plug&#146; riots. Pilling and other local Chartists took the lead in widening the strike throughout Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. They demanded not only the return to the wage levels of 1840, but the adoption of the <span class="roman">Charter</span> as the law of the land. Pilling believed, in common with most Chartists, that &#145;a fair day's pay for a fair day's work&#146; could be achieved only when working men had access to the machinery of law-making, and their trade societies were given legal recognition.<br>
<br>Pilling was arrested and brought to trial with Feargus O'Connor and fifty-seven other Chartists at the Lancaster assizes of April 1843. He made a famous speech from the dock, in which he described the tragedy of his own and his family's life; this was said to have reduced members of the jury and court officials to tears, and rendered his virtual acquittal inevitable. His speech was undoubtedly a masterpiece of controlled forensic rhetoric. However, by the time of the trial the intensity of the previous year had subsided, and Feargus O'Connor also made a strong defence of the strikers by emphasizing the industrial grievances which provoked their actions. This emphasis was encouraged by the judge in charge of the case, Baron Rolfe. It is in this context that Pilling's famous defence speech has to be read. In the assizes of the previous year more Chartist offenders had been sentenced to transportation and to heavy sentences than at any other time in the movement's history, and those in the dock in 1843 had good reason to expect heavy sentences. In fact, however, many, including Pilling, were acquitted on all counts and those against whom guilty verdicts were found were not called up for judgment and were in effect acquitted.<br>
<br>Pilling continued to be prominent in activities of the Chartists and of the weavers in Ashton and Stockport during the rest of the decade. He was delegate to the Chartist convention in 1844 and in 1846; at the 1844 convention he proposed a petition to parliament against the <span class="roman">Master and Servant Bill</span> and also urged Chartists to take part in local government activities of all kinds. He became a member and active supporter of the Chartist Land Plan when it was established in 1845. In March 1848 he chaired a meeting at Oldham Edge in which Chartists and Irish repealers welcomed the February revolution in France. In that year the tensions in the cotton districts were again extremely high, and on 14 August a clash in the streets of Ashton resulted in the death of a policeman. Pilling was not among the local Chartists who were rounded up after this event because he had on the same day left the town on his way to the United States of America. He found wages in the USA low and the working day in cotton mills excessively long; moreover, the trade there was overcrowded and dominated by cheap female and child labour. He returned in 1850, although some of his sons seem to have stayed on in the USA.<br>
<br>Back in Ashton, Pilling seems to have made a living, as did many former Chartists, from small trading and retailing activities. On his death certificate he was described as a tea dealer. He retained his loyalty to Chartism until the movement faded, and like many others, transferred his loyalties to popular Liberalism. He died at 211 Fleet Street, Ashton under Lyne, on 29 November 1874.<br>
