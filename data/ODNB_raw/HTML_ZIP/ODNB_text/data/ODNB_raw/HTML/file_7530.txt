<span class="headword">Dering,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1576), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and evangelical preacher</span>, was the third son of John Dering of Surrenden Dering, Kent, and of Margaret, daughter of John Brent of Charing in the same county.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>The Derings were an ancient family, predating the conquest. The seventeenth-century MP and antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7531/', "Sir Edward Dering, first baronet (1598&#150;1644)")</script>, was a great-nephew of Dering, and named for him. Dering entered Christ's College, Cambridge, and commenced BA in 1560, and MA in 1563. He took his BTh in 1568 and was expected to proceed to the doctorate. He was a fellow of Christ's from 1560 to 1570, and ordained deacon by Bishop Cox of Ely in 1561. There is no record of his ordination to the priesthood.<br>
<br>Dering laid the foundations for a notable ecclesiastical career. He gained a reputation as a Greek scholar&#151;&#145;the greatest learned man (so thought) in England&#146;, Archbishop Parker later caustically recalled  (Bruce and Perowne, 410)&#151;and he was chosen to make the Greek oration on the occasion of Queen Elizabeth's visit to the university in 1564. In 1566 he was proctor, and in 1567 Lady Margaret preacher. Dering spent time in Archbishop Parker's household, perhaps as a chaplain, and in 1567 Parker collated him to the rectory of Pluckley, which included his family seat of Surrenden Dering. He was non-resident, and it is not clear that his curate was licensed to preach. Later a different and perhaps converted Dering would condemn the life which he himself had led: &#145;While they are clothed in scarlet, ther flockes perishe for colde; and while they fare deliciouslie, ther people are faint with a most miserable hunger&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 12, fols. 190&#150;191<i>v</i>). Meanwhile, Dering was chaplain to England's premier nobleman, Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, and held another chaplaincy in the Tower of London. The greater preferments which might have followed were not altogether absent from his mind. He told Burghley that he was well known in Cambridge, in London, and at court. He was disappointed when Parker passed him over for the profitable peculiar of Bocking in Essex: &#145;If my necessarie wants were supplyed, I wold not desire great things &hellip;; if that had byn bestowed upon me, it should not have bene unwillinglie accepted&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 743/1, fols. 1&#150;2).<h2>
<a name="Administeringreproofs"></a>Administering reproofs</h2>That was in 1570, a year which seems to have been marked by a moral climacteric, which may have been connected with the radical presbyterian lectures delivered by Thomas Cartwright in the spring of that year, or with some deterioration in his own health, or with the downfall of his master, the duke of Norfolk. In 1572 Dering would write to the duke as he awaited execution, regretting that his &#145;high calling&#146; had caused him to bridle his words in taking him to task for his wicked servants, popish friends, and &#145;your adulterous woman&#146;. (Was this Mary, queen of Scots?) &#145;Why should I have tarried in your Lordship's house except these things had bin amended?&#146;  (Dering, &#145;Certaine godly and comfortable letters&#146;, <span class="italic">Workes</span>, 1597, sigs. D3&#150;E2<i>v</i>). At the very end, Dering wrote to Norfolk as to his &#145;Christian brother&#146;. Dering's tongue was not bridled when he read the book to the Kentish magnate Henry Neville, sixth Lord Abergavenny, whom he described as &#145;a lothesome example &hellip; an evell man&#146;; &#145;I love you in the Lorde and therfore I speak so playne&#146;  (Kent Archives Office, MS Dering C1/2). In March 1570 he resigned Pluckley and decided to unbridle his tongue to none other than William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and to Archbishop Parker. Burghley was charged with maladministration of the university of which he was chancellor. Parker was reprimanded for the lax administration of his province and for the religious condition of Kent, in which only two parishes out of six hundred enjoyed adequate instruction. He was also rebuked for swearing, and for allowing his sons and retainers to wear &#145;monstrous great breeches&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 743/1, fols. 1&#150;2).<br>
<br>As if this was not to burn bridges enough, Dering took the queen herself to task in the most outspoken Lenten sermon she ever heard. This should have presented a decisive career opportunity. Instead, Dering held Elizabeth personally responsible for the deplorable state of the ministry of her church:<blockquote>And yet you in the meane while that all these whordoms are committed, you at whose hands God will require it, you sit still and are carelesse, let men doe as they list. It toucheth not belike your common wealth, and therfore you are so well contented to let all alone. (<span class="italic">Derings Workes</span>, 27)</blockquote>No Elizabethan sermon was more often reprinted, with sixteen editions by the year of Elizabeth's death, 1603, sponsored, it appears, by John Field. As for its repercussions, Dering later told the queen that it was &#145;a great many yeeres &hellip;, and they have passed exceeding slowlie&#146; since he first heard how much she misliked him  (<span class="italic">Derings Workes</span>, sigs. *1&#150;3). What did he expect?<h2>
<a name="Puritanspokesman"></a>Puritan spokesman</h2>Clearly Dering was now some kind of puritan, if he had not been one before, and Christ's was a college which bred puritans, but it may be asked, what kind of puritan? In 1568, in a book written in defence of Bishop John Jewel and against the Catholic Thomas Harding, he wrote: &#145;Our service is good and godly, everie tittle grounded on holie scriptures&#146;  (Dering, <span class="italic">A Sparing Restraint</span>, pt 1.5). He claimed to have always been a conformist, and he told Burghley: &#145;I have never broken the peace of the Churche, nether for cappe nor surplesse, for archbyshop nor byshop.&#146; He was critical of Cartwright for standing &#145;so stiffly&#146; on indifferent matters. But he defended the nonconformist conscience. There was a proverb that the man who had been struck with the sword was afraid of the scabbard. Burghley was told: &#145;I would yow had seene the horror of sinne; I am sure yow woold also be afrayde of the shadow&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 12, fols. 190&#150;191<i>v</i>). Ceremonies and ecclesiastical dignities were shadows of the sin and corruption which were eating out the heart of the church. But Dering's own puritanism was a limitless concern with the substance of sin and with its remedy, preaching of the gospel. He was unique in insisting, in an unpublished treatise, &#145;Of the viseble Church, how it may be known&#146; (CKS, MS Dering U 350, C1/2), written by Archbishop Parker's commission against Nicholas Sander's <span class="italic">De visibili monarchia ecclesiae</span>, that preaching was an essential mark of the church. The preacher was nothing less than &#145;the minister by whom the people doe beleeve&#146;  (Edward Dering and John More, &#145;A briefe and necessarie catechisme&#146;, <span class="italic">Derings Workes</span>, sig. A3). This conviction enforced the jettisoning of worldly learning, and Dering condemned so-called preachers who &#145;use the pulpit like a philosopher's chaire&#146;  (Dering, &#145;XXVII lectures or readinges upon part of the epistle written to the Hebrues&#146;, ibid., sig. T5<i>v</i>). Parker thought that such sentiments contained &#145;too much childishness&#146;  (Bruce and Perowne, 409&#150;10).<br>
<br>Dering might have defined himself as a mere Christian, but he could not escape the ecclesiastical storm which struck in the early 1570s, with Cartwrightian presbyterianism popularized in the <span class="italic">Admonition to the Parliament</span> published by John Field and Thomas Wilcox. Dering was compromised when he visited Field and Wilcox in prison. But Bishop Edwin Sandys of London either still approved of Dering or found it expedient to seem to, and in 1572, the year of the <span class="italic">Admonition</span>, he appointed him reader of the divinity lecture in St Paul's Cathedral. At about the same time Dering secured (nominally from the crown) the prebend of Chardstock in Salisbury Cathedral. At St Paul's he delivered a celebrated course of lectures on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> and enjoyed a huge reputation; not only with those whom in a dedicatory epistle he called &#145;the godly in London&#146; but also with such patrons as Henry Killigrew and Catherine his wife, Burghley's sister-in-law, and the earl of Leicester. But the most popular preacher of the day was not popular with the queen. There followed a curious series of judicial charades, one of them conducted in Star Chamber, in which bishops and privy councillors vied with each other in trying not to seem to be Dering's accusers. Burghley and Sandys fell out over Dering. On 28 June 1573 the privy council ruled that Dering could continue his lectures, but a month later ordered him to &#145;surcease&#146;. Eventually, according to Dering himself, he was &#145;forbidden to preach any more openly&#146; in her majesty's dominions  (Dering, &#145;A sermon preached before the queenes maiestie&#146;, <span class="italic">Derings Workes</span>, sig. *). Yet a full year later Archbishop Parker was told that the queen &#145;disliked Deering's reading&#146;  (Bruce and Perowne, 476). In February 1575 there was a plan for Dering to succeed Thomas Sampson as the Clothworkers' lecturer at Whittington College, but it seems to have failed.<br>
<br>Through all these almost comic proceedings, Dering dealt with the burning issue of hierarchy like a vegetarian who occasionally eats meat. Jocular words spoken at a dinner party about Parker being the last archbishop of Canterbury were uttered &#145;merrily&#146;, although much was made of them. Dering declared that he loved the bishops as brethren and honoured them as elders, but confessed that he would not have chosen to be a bishop himself. His chequered, but for the most part protected, career is striking evidence of the powerlessness of the bishops, and even of the queen, to suppress a preacher who enjoyed the support of the great and the good in court, country, and city.<h2>
<a name="Marriagedeathandafterlife"></a>Marriage, death, and afterlife</h2>In 1572 Dering married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69054/', "Anne Locke (n&#233;e Vaughan, later Prowse)")</script>, a wealthy city widow who, of all the many female friends of the Scottish reformer John Knox, had most equally matched the latter in intellect. Dering's letter of proposal to this &#145;good possession&#146;  (Dering to Mrs Locke, n.d., Kent Archives Office, MS Dering C1/2) is surely the earliest surviving document of its kind to have been penned by a clergyman of the Church of England. To Mrs Locke, Dering must have seemed to be Knox reborn, a point which also occurred to John Field, who later stretched propriety in obtaining from Dering's widow and sending to the printer works by both Knox and Dering. But Anne Dering had to share her husband with many other ladies who depended on him for spiritual sustenance, among them Mrs Killigrew and the formidable Kentish matriarch and religious depressive Mrs Mary Honywood. Fourteen spiritual letters from Dering to women friends survive, notable examples of a distinct literary and religious genre, and about 1590 most of them were printed by Richard Schilders in Middelburg as <span class="italic">Certaine Godly and Verie Comfortable Letters, Full of Christian Consolation</span>. The women responded with reciprocal ministrations to a man who was by now in the late stages of pulmonary tuberculosis. He told Mrs Killigrew:<blockquote>I weigh not all the world a feather, and with as glad a minde I spit blood (I trust) as cleare spittle. To those that love God all things are for the best. He hath a hard hart that beleeveth not this. (Dering, &#145;Certaine godly and comfortable letters&#146;, <span class="italic">Derings Workes</span>, sig. C4)</blockquote>Dering died on 26 June 1576 at Thobie Priory in Essex, in a stylized deathbed scene, surrounded by preachers and others who recorded his last words.<br>
<br>Dering's affecting and early death helped to make him a living legend, a mirror of exemplary godliness and evangelical ardour. He was one of the first godly divines to have his collected works posthumously published. It is possible to infer from a letter to his widow that John Field was primarily responsible. The works consisted of set-piece sermons, including the sermon before the queen, the lectures on <span class="roman">Hebrews</span>, collections of prayers and of letters, and a catechism, jointly written with his Christ's contemporary John More, the &#145;apostle&#146; of Norwich, which achieved as a separate publication and in two versions at least forty-two editions. The almost clandestine 1590 Schilders edition of the <span class="italic">Workes</span> was succeeded by the more respectable and enlarged London editions of 1597 and 1614, an indication of how far the religious spirit of Elizabethan puritanism came to be accommodated within the Jacobean church. Dering's engraved portrait appeared in Henry Holland's <span class="italic">Her&#333;ologia Anglica</span> (1620) and Thomas Fuller included his deathbed speeches in <span class="italic">Abel redevivus</span> (1652).<br>
