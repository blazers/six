<span class="headword">Brunner <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Irving]</span>,  (Dorothea) Elizabeth</span>, Lady Brunner  (1904&#150;2003), <span class="occ">voluntary worker</span>, was born on 14 April 1904 at 1 Upper Woburn Place, London, the daughter of Henry Brodribb Irving (1870&#150;1919), actor&#150;manager, and his wife, Dorothea Forster, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baird (1873&#150;1933), the actress who created the part of Trilby in George Du Maurier's play of that name (1895) and later that of Mrs Darling in <span class="italic">Peter Pan</span> (1904). Her paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34116/', "Sir Henry Irving")</script>, the famous actor&#150;manager. She made her own stage d&eacute;but at the age of twelve, in <span class="italic">The Bells</span> (in which her father had a leading role), and many years later wrote a memoir, <span class="italic">Child of the Theatre</span> (published posthumously in 2010). She told the story of how much she enjoyed dressing up for the lord mayor's ball:<blockquote>My final outfit, and the best of all, was Brunhilde. Again the string and knitting needles provided my splendid armour, a Wagnerian crown adorned my head and lengths of chiffon draped my armour. I remember (as Brunhilde) falling dreadfully in love with a medieval knight. (<span class="italic">Child of the Theatre</span>, 25&#150;6)</blockquote>Elizabeth Irving was educated at home and then at South Hampstead high school, London, Oxford high school, and Wycombe Abbey. She left at sixteen to train as an actress in Oxford (under Rosina Filippi) and in London (under Komisarjevsky), and was herself a gifted actress. In the early 1920s she acted in both classical plays, including as Titania in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, and in the silent film of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s novel <span class="italic">Shirley</span> (1922). On 8 July 1926 she married Felix John Morgan Brunner (1897&#150;1982), businessman, son of Sir John Fowler Brunner, second baronet, and grandson of Sir John Tomlinson Brunner, first baronet, the co-founder of Brunner Mond, which became part of Imperial Chemical Industries in 1926. Her husband (who inherited the baronetcy in 1929) was a director of Brunner Mond and subsequently chairman of the Brunner Investment Trust until 1972. He was also active in Liberal politics, and served as president of the Liberal Party in 1962&#150;3. His family was of Swiss descent, and he and his young wife spent their honeymoon in Switzerland and walked extensively in the mountains of the Valais; they returned regularly to that area. They lived in London until 1937 and had five sons between 1927 and 1935. In 1937 they bought Greys Court near Henley-on-Thames.<br>
<br>While bringing up her family in the beautiful surroundings of Greys Court, Elizabeth Brunner over the years created a lovely garden among the ancient buildings. She also became increasingly involved in local life and especially in her local Women's Institute (WI). She was soon elected local president and in 1944 was elected a member of the national federation. In 1945 she proposed the successful resolution at the annual general meeting &#145;That this meeting welcomes the suggestion of a Women's Institute College &hellip; and instructs the Executive Committee to make the necessary arrangements&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). She subsequently became a member of the subcommittee set up to explore the idea further. It was realized in 1948 with the foundation of Denman College, Marcham. According to the historian of Denman College &#145;It was largely due to [Elizabeth Brunner's] drive and determination to overcome all obstacles that the idea became reality&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). She served as an energetic chairman of the National Federation of Women's Institutes from 1951 to 1956, and remained active in the WI both locally and nationally thereafter. She never forgot that the WI itself (and Denman College in particular) was committed to providing opportunities for adult education for women, not at that time readily available in rural areas.<br>
<br>The need to act and campaign both locally and nationally on litter and waste was a major concern by the 1950s. In 1955 the Keep Britain Tidy group was formed as a result of a resolution passed at the Women's Institutes' AGM the previous year, under the presidency of Elizabeth Brunner. She was the founding chairman of the new group in 1955&#150;6, remained president for many years, and was senior vice-president until the end of her life. For this work she was appointed OBE in 1964. She was also a JP for a great many years, chairman of the Women's Group on Public Welfare for ten years from 1960, and chairman of the Henley and District Housing Trust. From 1968 to 1971 she was a member of the general advisory council of the BBC.<br>
<br>In 1969 Greys Court was given by the Brunners to the National Trust, but Elizabeth and her husband continued to live there until their deaths. She would welcome members of the public as they went through the ground floor, including the large kitchen where she was often to be seen enjoying preparing food for her friends and guests. She had much admiration for Richard Wheeler of the National Trust, describing herself as &#145;much fortified by his presence&#146;  (private information). Her religious faith and her friendship with Archbishop Robert Runcie enabled her to go joyfully into old age. She subsequently added the Maze of Life to the Greys Court garden. Her husband (who had suffered much as a result of his experiences as an artillery officer in the First World War) died in 1982.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Brunner had a great sense of humour, and to be with her was always fun. She was also an excellent and prolific letter writer. Strangely (perhaps deliberately, perhaps not) she never included in the dates of her letters the year in which she was writing. This was even so in 1995 in letters describing the accident that befell her in St Luc, Switzerland, when she was badly injured, and as a result of which she suffered great pain. Few of her friends thought that she would ever return to Switzerland, but the next year she was back, to be received by the mayor with a speech of welcome and to the sound of fifes and drums. She returned every year until she was ninety-seven. She died at Greys Court on 9 January 2003, of heart failure, and was survived by three of her five sons. At her memorial service on 12 April her granddaughter, Isabel, gave an address in which she stressed her grandmother's &#145;readiness to talk about love&#146;, and her perhaps unusual grandmotherly advice that &#145;the way in love wasn't a kind of proper good sense but an instinctive feel for whether or not it was nice or not to be kissed by a certain person in a taxi&#146;  (private information). She was widely loved and much admired.<br>
