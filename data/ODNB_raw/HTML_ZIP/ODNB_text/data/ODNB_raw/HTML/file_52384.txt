<span class="headword">Roe,  Charles</span>  (1715&#150;1781), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, the youngest of the eight children of Thomas Roe (1670&#150;1723), vicar of Castleton, Derbyshire, and his wife, Mary Turner, was born on 7 May 1715 at Castleton and baptized there on 2 June 1715. When he was eight, on the death of his father, Roe moved to Stockport with his family. At some time after his mother's death in November 1724 he appears to have settled in Macclesfield with his sister Mary and elder brother William, who was appointed curate of the parochial chapel there from that year. An education at Macclesfield Free Grammar School is suggested by his strong ties and later governorship of the school.<br>
<br>At an early age financial circumstances forced Roe to enter the local button and twist trade, dependent on mohair, horsehair, oxhair, and silk and linen thread. His interest in silk increased, and, having become a freeman of Macclesfield in 1742, he built a small throwing mill on Park Green (1743&#150;4), followed by the large silk mill, in partnership with Messrs Glover &amp; Co., on Waters Green (1748). Both mills, modelled on Sir Thomas Lombe's original silk mill in Derby, were water-powered.<br>
<br>Roe held the office of mayor of Macclesfield in 1747&#150;8 and became an important merchant operating from his fine residence at 62&#150;64 Chestergate. In 1764 he withdrew from the silk trade because of his increasing involvement with the copper trade. In 1756 he had begun mining at Coniston in the Lake District and about the same time at Alderley Edge, near Macclesfield, trading as Charles Roe and Copper Company. Permission was obtained to build a copper smelter on Macclesfield Common in 1758, after which Roe entered into a lifelong partnership with Brian Hodgson, innkeeper of the Old Hall, Buxton, who held coal-mining interests at Disley. The company was a great success, building rolling mills for copper sheets and a brass-wire mill at Havannah, in Eaton, near Congleton, in 1763, followed by brass battery and rolling mills at Bosley, south of Macclesfield, in 1766. Large quantities of copper ores were initially bought from the duke of Devonshire's mine at Ecton Hill in Staffordshire, but mining operations were extended to Penrhyn-Du in north Wales during 1763 and Parys Mountain on Anglesey in 1764. Purchases of Cornish ore began in 1765, but Roe's vigorous petitioning for a canal scheme linking Macclesfield to the Mersey estuary was in vain. Undaunted, Roe, supported by John Walker of Liverpool, built a copper smelter on Liverpool's south shore in 1767. However, due to pressures from an unknown source claiming pollution, Roe &amp; Co. were fined and operations were moved further along the Mersey estuary to Toxteth Park. Roe received permission from Lord Molyneaux for this in 1770 (although the indenture was not completed until 1 May 1772).<br>
<br>A remarkably large find of copper ore at Parys Mountain by Roe's Derbyshire mining agent, Jonathan Roose, on 2 March 1768 ensured the continuing success of the company. Welsh miners celebrated the discovery annually for many years thereafter.<br>
<br>Together with other major brass and copper concerns, Roe &amp; Co. successfully petitioned parliament in 1767 against a royal charter to the Warmley Brass Company, run by William Champion. In 1774 a new partnership with the additional name the Macclesfield Copper Company was created, comprising Roe, Brian Hodgson, and thirteen other partners. This became one of the three greatest brass concerns of the late eighteenth century, using calamine from Shropshire, Somerset, Yorkshire, and north Wales.<br>
<br>Roe died intestate on 3 May 1781 at his home in Macclesfield after a winter in Bath. He was buried with great pomp and ceremony on 8 May in the family vault at Christ Church, Macclesfield, the church he had built at his own expense, costing &#145;upwards of six thousand pounds&#146; in the years 1775&#150;6. The officiating minister was Revd David Simpson, chosen by Roe as the first incumbent of Christ Church because of his more evangelical stance.<br>
<br>The first of Roe's three marriages was on 26 May 1743, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1750), the daughter of Samuel Lankford, a button merchant of Leek and later Roe's silk mill partner. The eldest son of their three surviving children, William (1747&#150;1827), took on responsibility for the business after his father's death, at the same time serving as a bailiff for Liverpool and commissioner of customs. On 25 April 1752 Roe married Mary Stockdale of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, who died in 1763, having had eight children. His third wife, whom he married on 23 October 1766 at Prestbury, Cheshire, was Rachel, whose father, John Harriott, owned an estate in Jamaica. Their only child, John Harriott Roe (1767&#150;1833), was recorder of Macclesfield (1804&#150;33).<br>
<br>Roe was a high-principled and hard-working man prone to an occasional outburst of temper. His fine portrait, painted in Liverpool in 1769 by Wright of Derby, depicts an apparently kindly and shrewd man.<br>
