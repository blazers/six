<span class="headword">Barclay,  Joseph</span>  (1831&#150;1881), <span class="occ">bishop of Jerusalem</span>, was born on 12 August 1831 near Strabane in co. Tyrone, Ireland, the son of John Barclay (<i>d</i>. 1845), gentleman, and his wife, Rebecca Brandon (<i>d</i>. 1874). His parents were of Scottish extraction, and he had two sisters. He was educated at a school in Strabane kept by a Presbyterian minister. Barclay went on to Trinity College, Dublin, and proceeded BA in 1854 and MA in 1857, but showed no particular powers of application or study. He was ordained deacon in the Church of Ireland in 1854 (and priest the following year), taking up a curacy at Bagnelstown, co. Carlow.<br>
<br>During this period Barclay began to take a great interest in the work of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. The question of Jewish conversion was then agitating the religious world in England, and Barclay energetically supported the cause in his own neighbourhood, until in 1858 his enthusiasm led him to offer himself to the London Society as a missionary. He left Ireland, much regretted by his parishioners and friends, and after a few months' study in London was appointed to Constantinople. The mission there had been established in 1835, but no impression had been made on the 60,000 Jews calculated to inhabit the town. Barclay stayed in Constantinople until 1861, making missionary journeys to the Danubian provinces, Rhodes, and other nearer districts. He acquired a thorough knowledge of the Spanish dialect spoken by the Sephardic Jews, and diligently prosecuted his studies in Hebrew. In 1861 he was nominated incumbent of Christ Church, Jerusalem, a position requiring energy and tact to avoid getting entangled in local quarrels; these rivalries Barclay described as a &#145;fretting leprosy&#146;, neutralizing his best efforts.<br>
<br>In 1865 Barclay visited England and Ireland on private matters, received the degree of LLD from his university, and married on 21 December. His wife was Lucy Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1882), the third daughter of the Revd W. W. Andrew of Ketteringham, Norfolk. The couple had a large family. On his return he found it impossible, as a married man, to continue in his post unless his salary was increased, and the London Society's refusal compelled his resignation in 1870. He returned to England and filled for a time the curacies of Howe in Lincolnshire and St Margaret's, Westminster, until in 1873 he was presented to the living of Stapleford in the St Albans diocese. The comparative leisure thus afforded him enabled him to publish in 1878 a book containing his translations of extracts from the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>. He had worked on it for sixteen years and, according to his biographer, it faithfully reproduced &#145;the sententious interrogative and involved style of the Rabbis&#146;  (Courtenay, 403). Unfortunately, critical opinion was divided over its importance; and Jewish readers regarded it as marked by an animus against their nation and literature. In 1880 Barclay received the degree of DD from Dublin University.<br>
<br>In 1879 the see of Jerusalem became vacant, and Dr Barclay's experience and attainments marked him out as the only man likely to fill the post successfully. He was consecrated at St Paul's Cathedral in London on 25 July 1879. He was most enthusiastically welcomed to Jerusalem, and entered on his duties with his usual vigour, but his sudden death there, after a short illness, on 23 October 1881 put an end to the hopes of those who believed that at last some aims of the bishopric's founders were to be realized. Bishop Barclay's attainments were considerable. He preached in Spanish, French, and German; he was intimately acquainted with biblical and rabbinical Hebrew; he was diligently engaged at his death in perfecting his knowledge of Arabic; and he had acquired some knowledge of Turkish during his residence in Constantinople. The bishop's widow returned to England, but she died on 5 March 1882 when giving birth to their eighth child.<br>
