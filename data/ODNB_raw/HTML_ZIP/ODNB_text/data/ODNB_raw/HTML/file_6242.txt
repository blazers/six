<span class="headword">Coote,  Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1609), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author</span>, was the son of Thomas Coote of Steeple Bumstead, Essex, and his wife, Anne Cole. Admitted pensioner at Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 24 March 1576, he graduated BA in 1580 and proceeded MA in 1583. On 8 October 1592 he married Barbara Cooke in the church of St Mary-the-Less which adjoined his college. The couple had a daughter, Hester, baptized there in 1594.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1596 Coote was appointed master of the King Edward VI Free School in Bury St Edmunds, but on 18 May the following year he resigned, for reasons which the governors' register does not reveal. During his brief tenure he published his pedagogical manual <span class="italic">The Englishe Scholemaister</span> (1596), whose thoroughly practical approach to the teaching of English explains its ensuing popularity. Coote's elaborate title-page summarizes his purpose&#151;to assist the teacher of the elementary literacy skills in &#145;the distinct reading and true writing of our English tongue&#146;. The text opens with a fourteen-point statement of &#145;The Schoole-maister his profession&#146;, followed by a &#145;Preface for the direction of the reader&#146;, among whom he included &#145;men and women of trades (as tailors, weavers, shopkeepers, seamsters and such other) as have undertaken the charge of teaching others&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>). Coote then proceeds via the letters of the alphabet, syllables, and two- and three-syllable words to offer a mode of spelling lesson, with an older pupil &#145;opposing&#146; a younger. The importance of pronunciation is emphasized by objecting to such habits as pronouncing &#145;my naunt for mine aunt and thy nuncle for thine uncle&#146;, together with the injunction &#145;Take heed also you put not id for ed as unitid for united&#146; and &#145;ignorantly writing a cup a wine for a cup of wine, and other like absurdities&#146;  (ibid., 31). A seven-page catechism with proof texts in the margin is followed by &#145;Sundry Necessarie Observations for a Christian&#146; in the form of a series of moral maxims, a set of prayers for use at various times of the day, and a group of versified psalms. A half-page introduction to numbers is cut short in order to leave space for a 22-page list of &#145;hard words (especially from the Latin and French)&#146;  (ibid., 72&#150;94). Coote's was not the first such book to be published. It was, however, by far the most popular, and continued to be printed throughout the seventeenth century, reaching a fifty-fourth edition in 1737.<br>
<br>After leaving Bury St Edmunds, Coote taught at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, although the circumstances of his appointment are unknown. A son, Samuel, was baptized there in 1607. Coote died in 1609, and was buried on the same day as his wife, 13 February 1609, at St Mary's Church in the adjacent parish of Sawbridgeworth.<br>
