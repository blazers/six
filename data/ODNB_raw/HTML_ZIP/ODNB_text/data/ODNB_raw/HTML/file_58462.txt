<span class="headword">Sheldon,  Helen Maud</span>  (1859&#150;1945), <span class="occ">headmistress and educationist</span>, was born in Handsworth, Birmingham, on 15 October 1859, the second daughter of John Sheldon (1822?&#150;1903), at that time vicar of St James's, Handsworth, and his wife, Anne <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharp (1830?&#150;1907). The family consisted of five daughters and two surviving sons. When at an early age Maud, as she was known in the family, decided that she wanted above everything to teach, her father undertook to give her the best education obtainable. The daughters attended Handsworth Ladies' College and three went on to Cambridge: Sheldon herself read mathematics at Girton, and one younger sister read science at Newnham, while another read classics, again at Girton. This was a considerable sibling achievement at a time when university education for women had barely begun: Sheldon actually took the tripos in 1881&#151;the year before women were formally admitted to the final examination. She was unofficially ranked two-thirds of the way down the tripos list in mathematics (which contained six women and more than ninety men). Not until 1906 was she able to obtain the MA degree she had earned, from Trinity College, Dublin. After preliminary experience (1881&#150;4) at a school run by the Girls' Public Day School Trust (GPDST) at Kensington, west London, Sheldon returned to Girton as resident lecturer in mathematics (1884&#150;7). However, a contemporary reports her assertion that she &#145;did not know enough mathematics&#146;  (Smith), and her final career choice led to a working life spent entirely at GPDST schools. In 1888 she became a mathematics mistress at Blackheath high school in south-east London, under the headship of the remarkable Miss Gadesden, until her talent for leadership was acknowledged by an appointment as headmistress at Dover high school, Kent (1898&#150;1901). Then she was rapidly promoted to headmistress of Sydenham high school, south-east London, where she had the opportunity to realize her wider potential. This school had been founded in 1887, and Sheldon was its second headmistress. She was responsible for introducing to GPDST schools the organization into houses and the prefect system (of proven success in boys' independent schools). Her generosity was legendary and occasionally inspired: it often took the form of supplying much-needed equipment&#151;notably a retired tram for use as a sports pavilion. Having inherited money from her mother, she was able to indulge her munificent impulses by lending money interest-free in order to buy adjoining properties to enable the school to expand. The school orchestra was practically her creation.<br>
<br>A. H. H. Maclean, a long-serving secretary to the GPDST, apparently amused himself by inventing anonymous rhymes about some headmistresses he encountered. (The collection was privately printed as <span class="italic">H.M.'S.: Some of them</span> in 1932.) There is common consent that he was referring to Sheldon when he wrote:<blockquote>
<div>She had at times a grumpy way<br>
</div>
<div>Of saying what she had to say.<br>
</div>
<div>We didn't mind, because, behind,<br>
</div>
<div>We knew that she was wise and kind.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The first couplet may have represented reaction to the abruptness of manner typical of a forthright woman. It is perhaps of greater significance that a former pupil&#151;with hindsight of eighty years&#151;remembers &#145;a lesson in integrity &hellip; even more important than learning&#146;  (private information). Another, from the Blackheath days, has mentioned the aptness of her initials' reinforcing her aura of authority, while recalling that &#145;she had an awfully nice face and a humorous twinkle&#146;  (Friends of the GPDST, 43).<br>
<br>Sheldon was headmistress at Sydenham from 1901 to 1917, and her retirement (aged fifty-seven) in the middle of the disruption due to the war was somewhat unexpected. She continued to live in the area, and was elected to the borough council of Lewisham, which included Sydenham. Her service as treasurer of the Association of Headmistresses from 1905 to 1909 was recognized by her being made an honorary life member. She retained her interest in mathematical education, having contributed to the ground-breaking 1916 report of the Mathematical Association, <span class="italic">Elementary Mathematics in Girls' Schools</span>. She served as a member of the council of Girton College in 1910&#150;19. In the early 1920s she moved to central London and in 1931 to Richmond. She died on 16 May 1945 at the Royal Northern Hospital, Holloway, London.<br>
