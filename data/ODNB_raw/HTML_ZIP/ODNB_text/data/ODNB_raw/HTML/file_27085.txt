<span class="headword">Taylor,  Thomas</span>  (1738&#150;1816), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, son of Thomas Taylor, a tanner, was born on 11 November 1738 at Rothwell, Yorkshire, and raised as a Presbyterian. His parents died before he was six years old, and he proved careless and headstrong as a youth. At seventeen he was impressed by George Whitefield's preaching, but soon reverted to his old lifestyle. Three years later he was &#145;convinced of sin&#146;, joined the Methodists, and began to preach. Wesley met him at Birstall in 1761 and invited him to attend that year's conference in London, where he was appointed the first itinerant preacher of the connexion in Wales. During his fifty-five years as a travelling preacher he saw hard service, with privations and persecution in Wales, England, Ireland, and Scotland (where he pioneered Methodist work in Glasgow). He was one of the inner circle of preachers on whom Wesley relied in the last decade of his life. He was president of the conference in 1796, when Alexander Kilham, founder of the Methodist New Connexion, was expelled from the society, and again in 1809.<br>
<br>In 1767 Taylor had married, at Chester, Nancy, the granddaughter of a Huguenot refugee. James Everett described him as:<blockquote>Large in person; ordinary features. Good understanding; a useful preacher; matter, manner, and style homely, though not coarse &hellip; voice a little husky, and natural temper short and peevish, but subdued by divine grace &hellip; with few drawbacks, a fine specimen of the old school. (Everett, 1.345&#150;6)</blockquote>A man of little formal education, Taylor had by hard study mastered Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He published numerous sermons, controversial tracts, including <span class="italic">An Answer to Paine's &#145;Age of Reason&#146;</span> (1796), and a detailed <span class="italic">History of the Waldenses and Albigenses</span> (1793). He died at Birch House, near Bolton, Lancashire, on 13 October 1816. His desire, expressed in his last sermon shortly before his death, &#145;to die, like an old soldier, sword in hand&#146;, was granted, and James Montgomery's poem (&#145;The Christian Soldier's Death&#146;) conveys his indomitable spirit:<blockquote>
<div>Servant of God! well done,<br>
</div>
<div>Rest from thy lov'd employ.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Methodist Magazine</span>, 474)</blockquote>
