<span class="headword">Hodgson,  Brian Houghton</span>  (1801?&#150;1894), <span class="occ">diplomatist and Nepalese scholar</span>, was born on 1 February 1801, or (less probably) 1800, at Lower Beech, Prestbury, Cheshire, the second of the seven children of Brian Hodgson (1766&#150;1858), country gentleman, and his wife, Catherine (1775/6&#150;1851), daughter of William Houghton of Manchester and Newton Park, Lancashire. The name Brian had also been borne by his grandfather and great-grandfather, landowners in the midlands and north-west England. Following failure in a banking venture, his father sold their home at Lower Beech but family connections, including a great-aunt married to Beilby Porteus, bishop of London, helped to offset financial difficulties. He remained in Cheshire until 1814 when he moved to Clacton, Essex, on appointment as warden of the Martello towers. In 1820 he became barrack-master at Canterbury.<br>
<br>Hodgson was educated at Macclesfield grammar school until 1814 and from 1814 to 1816 under Daniel Delafosse at Richmond, Surrey. In 1816 he was nominated for the Bengal civil service by James Pattison, a director of the East India Company. From February 1816 to December 1817 he attended the company's training college at Haileybury, where the influence of Thomas R. Malthus, professor of history and political economy, turned him into &#145;an advanced liberal&#146;  (Hunter, 23). He excelled in economics, classics, and Bengali and graduated head of his year.<br>
<br>After arriving in Calcutta early in 1818, Hodgson led a full social life while continuing the study of Sanskrit and Persian at Fort William College. He was particularly successful with Persian, then still an official language within British India and the medium of formal communication with independent Indian states; but a near-fatal attack of fever interrupted his course, making an immediate hill posting essential. In late 1819 he was appointed assistant commissioner of Kumaon, a territory annexed from Nepal in 1815 during the war which ended the country's expansion and deprived it of a third of its pre-war territory. Hodgson worked on the revenue settlement under the commissioner, George Traill, a strong believer in a paternalist administrative style and in detailed study of the land and its people. In 1820 he was promoted to the assistant residentship at the Nepalese capital, Katmandu, but he moved to Calcutta in 1822 as acting deputy secretary in the Persian department of the Foreign Office. Renewed ill health necessitated his return to Katmandu in early 1824 as residency postmaster until his reappointment as assistant resident in 1825. He was to be plagued by illness throughout his time in Nepal and India. He gave up meat and alcohol after recurrence of a liver complaint in 1837.<br>
<br>Continuing studies begun in 1820&#150;21, he investigated Nepalese institutions and commerce and became proficient in Nepali and Newari, the language of the Katmandu valley's indigenous inhabitants. Despite family obligations which kept him in debt until 1837, he retained at his own expense a group of local research assistants, training himself and some of his staff as naturalists, specializing particularly in ornithology. He described 39 new mammalian and 150 bird species and published 127 zoological papers. He was also an avid collector of Buddhist scriptures in Sanskrit and Tibetan and was the first to reveal to the West the Sanskrit literature of northern, or Mahayana, Buddhism, which had been preserved only in Nepal. Texts he sent to Paris enabled the Sanskritist Eug&egrave;ne Burnouf to produce his seminal studies. In his own interpretation of his Buddhist Sanskrit materials, guided by his Nepalese friend and pandit Amritananda, Hodgson adopted a misconceived division of Buddhist doctrine into four &#145;schools&#146; and, as he later admitted, wrongly argued that his Sanskrit texts were older than the Pali scriptures of Hinyana Buddhism. Nevertheless, much of his analysis still holds good.<br>
<br>Hodgson finally became resident in his own right on 21 January 1833, having been acting resident between 1829 and 1831. He was already convinced that Nepal's continuing resentment of defeat, her isolationist policy, and the maintenance of a large standing army were a threat to peace which could be removed by encouraging the growth of commerce with British India and Tibet and by employing the country's military manpower in the East India Company's forces. Like previous residents he initially favoured co-operation with Bhimsen Thapa, the minister who had long dominated Nepalese politics but relied heavily on the support of the army. However, he soon decided that relations with the British would improve if managed directly by the young King Rajendra. He began pressing for direct access to the king and for concessions on trade but was restrained by the Indian government.<br>
<br>Hodgson sympathized with Bhimsen's prominent opponent, Ranjang Pande, and was particularly influenced by Ranjang's Brahman ally, Krishna Ram Mishra. When Bhimsen sought British support for his weakening position, Hodgson strengthened the opposition by ensuring no substantive negotiations took place during a visit to Calcutta in 1835&#150;6 by Bhimsen's nephew. In July 1837 Bhimsen was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the death of King Rajendra's infant son, and when the king asked for his advice Hodgson recommended that Bhimsen be kept in custody during investigations. The following summer, finding that both the king and Ranjang's faction were in fact ready to capitalize on anti-British feeling both at home and among other independent Indian states, Hodgson transferred his sympathies to the Poudyal brothers. This Brahman family had long been rivals with the Mishras for influence with the royal family. He formed a particularly close relationship with the second brother, Krishna Ram Poudyal, frequently reporting and seconding his opinions in letters to the governor-general.<br>
<br>During 1839 much of the nobility felt threatened by Ranjang's faction and began looking to the residency for political support. In July Bhimsen Thapa committed suicide in prison. According to the Nepalese officials who brought Hodgson the news, he wept on hearing it; he had at first refused Bhimsen's smuggled plea to intervene on his behalf and his later request to the governor-general for permission to speak out was sent too late. Instability continued into 1840 with an armed Nepalese incursion into British territory and a brief army mutiny that seemed at one point to threaten the residency itself. As well as successfully demanding a Nepalese withdrawal, the governor-general, Lord Auckland, now authorized Hodgson to press the king to appoint new advisers friendly to the British. With an army embroiled in Afghanistan, Auckland was not ready for a full-scale campaign against Nepal, but Hodgson's negotiations and the movement of troops closer to the border secured the appointment at the beginning of 1841 of a &#145;British ministry&#146; including both Krishna Ram Poudyal and his more prominent brother, Ranganath.<br>
<br>In April 1842 Hodgson was involved in a public clash with King Rajendra over an Indian merchant who had taken refuge at the residency. He subsequently decided not to deliver to the king a letter concerning the incident from the new governor-general, Lord Ellenborough, believing it would weaken the position of the pro-British ministers. Ellenborough ordered his instant dismissal but subsequently relented and left him in post with instructions to disengage gradually from internal politics. He complied, but still sought to influence events through policy advice. Hodgson wanted to remain in Nepal until 1844, ostensibly to complete a general study of the country but, according to oral tradition in Katmandu, also because of the birth of a third child to his Nepalese Muslim lover, Begum Meharunnisha. Despite an appeal from King Rajendra for his retention, Ellenborough insisted on his departure from Katmandu in December 1843. Offered only a minor post at Simla, he resigned from the civil service and returned to England in 1844.<br>
<br>The portrait of Hodgson as the complete master of events in Katmandu presented by his friend and biographer, William Hunter, is no longer accepted, and even Lord Auckland, who allowed him a free hand in late 1840, sensed that his sudden enthusiasms could leave him open to manipulation. Nevertheless, Hodgson did succeed in keeping the peace, and the war with Nepal which Auckland had thought likely to come was avoided. The regret expressed in Katmandu at his departure reflected a belief that he had prevented a clash with British India which would have ended Nepalese independence.<br>
<br>After time with his parents in Canterbury and with his sister Fanny, who was educating his two elder children in Holland, Hodgson returned to India in 1845. Barred by the British authorities from returning in a private capacity to Katmandu, he settled at Darjeeling, a hill station just east of the Nepal border. He kept somewhat aloof from the local European community and his correspondence shows unhappiness at his countrymen's increasing racism towards Indians. The botanist Joseph Hooker stayed with him from 1848 to 1850 and he was also joined by his own son Henry, who died at Darjeeling in 1856. He was for a time entrusted with the education of a son-in-law of Jang Bahadur Rana, who had become master of Nepal in 1846. In October 1857 he helped persuade the governor-general, Lord Canning, to accept Jang Bahadur's offer of Nepalese help in suppressing the mutiny.<br>
<br>Hodgson continued work on zoology and the physical geology of the Himalayas, but concentrated in particular on the ethnology of the peoples of northern India, relying extensively on linguistic comparisons. Though taking the part of aboriginal peoples against later, Hindu settlers, he also advocated mass European settlement in the hills. His belief that all the &#145;non-Aryan&#146; peoples of India belonged to one great &#145;Tamulian&#146; family was misconceived, but he successfully demonstrated the relationship of many languages of Nepal and north-east India to Tibetan and Chinese. He had opposed William Bentinck's 1835 decision to accept Macaulay's arguments and make English the medium of both education and administration in India. He now continued his advocacy of mother-tongue education, arguing from analogy with the replacement of Latin for scholarly purposes by the modern languages of Europe. In 1854 he saw the principle of mass vernacular education accepted by the Indian government.<br>
<br>During a visit to Europe in 1853 Hodgson met and married Anne Scott (1815/16&#150;1868), daughter of General Henry Alexander Scott, probably shortly after the death of his Nepalese partner, who had remained throughout in Katmandu. His wife returned with him to Darjeeling, but because of her ill health and that of his father, Hodgson left India in 1858. He retired to Gloucestershire, living first at Dursley and then at Alderley Grange, near Wotton under Edge, and, after 1883, wintering at Menton on the French riviera. His wife died in January 1868 and in 1869 he married Susan Townshend, daughter of the Revd Chambr&eacute; Townshend of Derry, co. Cork. His children born in Nepal all died early and there were none from either of his marriages. He himself enjoyed a vigorous old age, riding to hounds until the age of sixty-eight, keeping up his academic interests, and holding a candle for Gladstone and Irish home rule among the largely tory local gentry. He died peacefully at 48 Dover Street, London, on 23 May 1894 and was buried in Alderley churchyard; his second wife survived him.<br>
<br>The most important of Hodgson's non-zoological writings were reissued as <span class="italic">Essays on the languages, literature and religion of Nepal and Tibet together with further papers on the geography, ethnology and commerce of those countries</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Essays Relating to Indian Subjects</span> (2 vols., 1880), which are regularly reprinted in India and Nepal. He donated some 400 Sanskrit manuscripts, two sets of the Tibetan Kahgyur and Stangyur encyclopaedias (the Tibetan Buddhist canon, and commentaries on the scriptures and other treatises, respectively), 10,000 zoological specimens, and 1800 drawings to libraries and museums. Materials that he gave to the India Office Library in 1864 remain a key source for Nepalese history. Recognition in his lifetime included his being made a member of the Royal Asiatic Society (1828), elected a fellow of the Linnean Society (1835) and of the Royal Society (1877), made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1838), and awarded the honorary degree of DCL at Oxford University (1889).<br>
<br>Surviving photographs and the bust by T. E. Thornycroft confirm references to Hodgson's finely cut features and dignified bearing. Brought up in the Church of England he remained a theist but was unwilling to discuss his religious beliefs. He could show rash judgement and over-sensitivity to affronts. To a modern reader his writings sometimes show signs of pomposity and, less frequently, of a patronizing attitude towards Indians and Nepalese. His virtues included a marked ability to inspire affection and loyalty, prodigious intellectual energy and enthusiasm, and a strong belief in the human potential of all races.<br>
