<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Elton,  Charles Sutherland</span>  (1900&#150;1991), <span class="occ">animal ecologist</span>, was born on 29 March 1900 at Withington, Manchester, the youngest of the three children, all sons, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33016/', "Oliver Elton (1861&#150;1945)")</script>, literary scholar and translator, and his wife, Letitia Maynard (1865&#150;1948), writer, daughter of the Revd Dugald MacColl of Glasgow and his wife, Janet Mathieson. The Elton forebears were from Cheshire, and later from near Ledbury, Herefordshire. His maternal great-grandmother, Janet Sutherland, from the east coast of Sutherland, was the source (via his uncle, Dugald Sutherland MacColl, the watercolour artist) of his middle name.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyecologicalresearch"></a>Education and early ecological research</h2>Elton's youthful zest for natural history was actively encouraged and directed by his eldest brother, Geoffrey, seven years his senior, who was to die suddenly in 1927, aged thirty-four, and to whom he dedicated his first and most famous book, <span class="italic">Animal Ecology</span> (1927). Eight long summer family holidays spent on the Eastnor estate in the Malvern hills also had a huge influence on his outlook.<br>
<br>Military training dominated Elton's schooldays at Liverpool College (1913&#150;18), but he immersed himself in Darwin's <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span> and in the complete works of Alfred Russel Wallace. On leaving school he was called up briefly into the Royal Engineers, signal training service, before going up to New College, Oxford, in 1919, to read zoology under E. S. Goodrich. Elton and others rebelled against the continuing emphasis, in zoology then, on comparative anatomy and descriptive embryology. In any spare time he studied the behaviour and life histories of living animals in a large number of ponds near his Liverpool home and also in the Lake District and near Oxford. He used his windowsill in New College for early experiments on the warning colours of water mites.<br>
<br>Fired with enthusiasm for polar exploration after the reports and films of Scott's and Shackleton's pre- and mid-war expeditions, a group of young biologists and geologists, most of them from Oxford University, set up the Oxford University expedition to Spitsbergen (Svalbard) in 1921. Invited by his tutor, Julian Huxley, to join it as his assistant, Elton, then a second-year undergraduate, was in fact given a free hand to do his own work. This expedition, followed by two more in 1923 and 1924, was to have the most profound influence on Elton's thinking and ideas about animal communities and interactions within them, in this high latitude, isolated land that was &#145;heavily glaciated, ice-bound for most of the year and some parts even in summer&#146;  (Elton MSS, A47, 1). He worked closely with V. S. Summerhayes, a botanist from University College, London, and veteran of the battle of the Somme. Summerhayes and Elton, publishing in the <span class="italic">Journal of Ecology</span> in 1923 and 1928, found that the effect on climate of the Gulf Stream meeting the polar ice-pack in Spitsbergen was reflected in four life zones for both the plant and animal communities. In 1927 Elton was a founding member of the Oxford University Exploration Club. In 1929 he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Murchison grant for his three seasons' study of the distribution of life in Spitsbergen.<br>
<br>After taking first-class honours in zoology in 1922 Elton was appointed departmental demonstrator in 1923, university demonstrator in 1929, and finally university reader in animal ecology and senior research fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1936, posts he held until his retirement in 1967. In his statutory lectures to undergraduates his scholarly teaching was, much later, considered to be<blockquote>marked by a complete lack of dogmatism. &hellip; One felt that to tell his audience what to think would have appeared to him to be insulting. &hellip; He always gave a carefully researched and balanced treatment of a subject with copious references to both sides of an argument. (Macfadyen, 500)</blockquote>&#145;It was when he dropped his voice and became least audible that he made his most profound and original remarks&#146;  (Crowcroft, 142).<br>
<br>Soon after the last Spitsbergen expedition, Elton produced his first book, <span class="italic">Animal Ecology</span> (1927), about general principles regulating animal communities. &#145;Elton &hellip; set out to turn natural history into science, and that, of course, is what ecology is: the quantitative and experimental study of living organisms in relation to their environments&#146;  (Hardy, &#145;Influence&#146;, 3). Great clarity and deceptive simplicity of language and style mark out this classic work, which had a major influence on generations of young biologists the world over. Reprinted nine times (and republished with a new preface and &#145;selected later reading&#146; in 1966) it was still in print more than fifty years later, and was translated into Russian, Polish, Spanish, and Japanese. It was republished in North America in 2001.<h2>
<a name="Investigatingpopulationfluctuations"></a>Investigating population fluctuations</h2>The second main line of research which engaged Elton and colleagues for many years was into fluctuations in numbers, and at times plagues, of animals and the importance of movements of their populations. His participation in the 1930 Oxford University expedition to Lapland fuelled his interest in this problem. These fluctuations can be of serious economic and epidemiological importance, so Elton and his colleagues carried out intensive investigations into the population dynamics of mice and voles in Bagley Wood, near Oxford, from 1923 to 1931. About the same time he had begun extensive research into the roughly ten yearly and three to four yearly cycles of Canadian wildlife, notably those of the fur bearing mammals. They all hit the bottom of their cycles in 1931. Elton, in his broad survey <span class="italic">Voles, Mice and Lemmings: Problems in Population Dynamics</span> (1942), described the poverty this caused in northern Labrador. Added to the trough of the worldwide depression, this hit projects like the Oxford work. Elton had been the Hudson Bay Company's biological consultant since 1925, and now took part in an international conference on biological cycles called at the remote fishing village of Matamek, on the north shore of the Gulf of St Lawrence. One result was that the New York Zoological Society gave financial support to the Oxford work. To this the Royal Society added a large sum for research on vole populations, and in 1932 Elton, as director, was able to start his Bureau of Animal Population; it was primarily to act as a clearing house for information on population changes in Canadian wildlife, but also to be a centre for the study of mammalian populations (mainly rodents at first). However, despite many decades of research on both sides of the Atlantic on the problems of cycling / fluctuating mammalian populations, the mechanism was still not satisfactorily resolved within Elton's lifetime.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the bureau (with its expertise in the study of mice and voles) was switched to research, under the Agricultural Research Council, into effective control of rodents and rabbits to protect the nation's foodstuffs. &#145;The Bureau team, under Elton's low-key but powerful leadership, introduced some novel ideas into British rodent control&#146;  (Crowcroft, 29). A most generous anonymous donor (much later revealed, by Crowcroft, as Sir John Ellerman, second baronet) enabled the results of the bureau's war work to be published in 1954 as <span class="italic">The Control of Rats and Mice</span>, in three volumes (the first two, on <span class="italic">Rats</span>, edited by D. H. Chitty, and the third, on <span class="italic">House Mice</span>, edited by H. N. Southern). Elton provided a masterly introduction and overview to this work.<br>
<br>During the war Elton and other ecologists were also looking forward to the post-war reconstruction period and planning the practical aspects of future national nature reserves. With A. G. Tansley and Captain C. Diver he played a major part in the report of the Wildlife Conservation Special Committee (1947), chaired by J. S. Huxley. Much of its advice was accepted by the government, and the Nature Conservancy was established in 1949, under the privy council. Elton was a member of its scientific policy committee from 1949 to 1956, and was closely involved with the Nature Conservancy throughout its sixteen-year existence.<br>
<br>In the light of his long-standing interest in zoogeography (on which he lectured to undergraduates, as well as on animal ecology), Elton outlined his own ideas on conservation and invasion biology in <span class="italic">The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants</span> (1958, republished in North America in 2000). He showed how Wallace's realms had been broken down over the previous 200 years following the huge increase in, and speed of, man's mobility all over the world, with many animal and plant species becoming pests in their new homes and new food chains replacing old ones. He maintained that ecological principles had to be applied to practical conservation (and gave three BBC broadcasts about this in 1957): &#145;Conservation&#146;, he believed, &#145;should mean the keeping or putting in the landscape of the greatest possible ecological variety&#151;in the world, in every continent or island, and so far as practicable in every district &hellip; provided the native species have their place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ecology of Invasions</span>, 155).<h2>
<a name="Studyingcomplexcommunities"></a>Studying complex communities</h2>Fresh opportunities arose after the war for Elton to develop research into more complex animal communities, since Oxford University had just acquired the nearby Wytham estate, with roughly 1000 acres of deciduous woodland and grassland and small freshwater bodies. In 1949 Elton, as president of the British Ecological Society, gave an inspired address, &#145;Population interspersion: an essay on animal community patterns&#146; (published in the <span class="italic">Journal of Ecology</span> in 1949), in which he envisaged a continuing ecological survey which was to study all groups of animals and all kinds of habitat, involving plant ecologists as well. He thought that the newly founded Nature Conservancy might set up active research centres where ecologists' data and notes on communities and species could be accumulated and used scientifically. The computerized Biological Records Centre at Monks Wood, near Huntingdon, later did just that, though its primary task was the mapping of species' distribution.<br>
<br>At first Elton's ecological survey covered Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Buckinghamshire, but later it concentrated on the Wytham area, contributions to the whole picture being made by some of his staff, visiting scientists, and graduate students. With R. S. Miller, an American postgraduate from Colorado, Elton developed for ecological survey a practical system of habitat classification by structural characters (published in the <span class="italic">Journal of Ecology</span> in 1954). In his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The Pattern of Animal Communities</span> (1966), Elton set out to assess all that had been revealed using these methods over the previous twenty years. Besides bird and mammal populations (using the whole wood), communities in many kinds of minor habitats had thrown light on the larger canvas of interactions, which he referred to as a &#145;girder system&#146; of partly interlocking community units which might show &#145;ecological resistance&#146;.<br>
<br>Just before and after retirement Elton went on several expeditions to tropical South America and to Montserrat in the West Indies to experience and study, though very briefly, the complexity and diversity of tropical rain forest&#151;at the opposite extreme from his Spitsbergen tundra communities. The results of his studies were published in articles in the <span class="italic">Journal of Animal Ecology</span> in 1973, and in <span class="italic">Biological Conservation</span> in 1975.<br>
<br>Elton had founded the <span class="italic">Journal of Animal Ecology</span> in 1932, continuing as editor until 1951. In his honour, after his retirement, the British Ecological Society published the February 1968 issue of the journal as a Festschrift, consisting entirely of papers (all, as usual, rigorously refereed) by members and ex-members of the Bureau of Animal Population. The bureau had become a world centre for research in terrestrial animal ecology, attracting younger research workers &#145;who carried the Elton tradition to distant places&#146;  (Hardy, &#145;Elton, Charles&#146;). It had been properly established in 1947 as part of the administrative department of zoological field studies, under the sympathetic chairmanship of the newly appointed Linacre professor of zoology and comparative anatomy, Alister Clavering Hardy (of plankton recorder fame). The essence of the bureau was bound up with Elton's genius as a field naturalist and observer, with his breadth of scholarship, his worldwide appreciation of the nature of learning, and with his insight as a scientist, and it ceased to exist when he retired. (An insect physiologist, J. W. S. Pringle, was by then the Linacre professor.)<br>
<br>Besides the books already noted, Elton published <span class="italic">Animal Ecology and Evolution</span> (1930, from three lectures at University College, London), <span class="italic">Ecology of Animals</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Exploring the Animal World</span> (1933, BBC talks for amateur naturalists), and some book reviews which were, at times, hard hitting. All but one of his books were translated into several languages. He also wrote ninety-eight articles (most published in scientific journals), of which twenty-eight were either co-authored or edited by him. There are thirty-four unpublished natural history notebooks in the Bodleian Library. He was honoured by eight American scientific bodies, including the New York Zoological Society, of which he became an honorary member in 1931, and the Ecological Society of America (life member and eminent ecologist award, 1961); he also received the John and Alice Tyler ecology award (1976) and the Edward W. Browning award (1977) for conserving the environment. Honours from British scientific societies included honorary membership of the British Ecological Society (1960), fellowship of the Royal Society (1953) and its Darwin medal (1970), and the Linnean Society's gold medal (1967).<br>
<br>Elton's first marriage, in 1928, was to Rose Montague (1906&#150;1997); this marriage, without issue, was dissolved amicably in 1937. On 1 December of the same year he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73092/', "(Edith) Joy Scovell (1907&#150;1999)")</script>, the poet, and daughter of the Revd Frederick George Scovell, vicar of St Andrew's Church, Sharrow, Sheffield. They had a daughter, Catherine Ingrid (<i>b</i>. 1940), a nurse, and a son, Robert Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1943), a medical statistician.<h2>
<a name="Characterandmemorials"></a>Character and memorials</h2>Of medium height and build Elton had, by middle age, lost much of the hair from &#145;his heavy thoughtful head&#146;&#151;as his wife put it in her poem <span class="italic">A Naturalist</span>  (E. J. Scovell, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 1988, 87). Fair skinned, blue-eyed, and clean-shaven, and usually a very serious man, he &#145;was never an easy person to know&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 May 1991). His mild manner and quiet voice belied his underlying toughness, and he came to be known, in a friendly way, as &#145;The Boss&#146; by staff and students in the post-war bureau. He could not abide crowds and, even in his fifties, refused to attend meetings with more than thirty people present, so in 1976 had to receive the munificent Tyler award in Los Angeles by proxy. He hated unauthorized photography and in the early 1970s refused to sit for his portrait to be painted with three other eminent former colleagues for a set piece commissioned for the new zoology building&#151;&#145;I don't intend to adorn the walls of the Sistine Chapel!&#146;  (private information). However, Denys Kempson's portrait photographs of him were hung in Oxford University's department of zoology and Corpus Christi College.<br>
<br>Having lived all his adult life in Oxford, Elton died at St Luke's Nursing Home, Latimer Road, Oxford, on 1 May 1991, following a stroke. His funeral service took place at Oxford crematorium on 4 May 1991. He was survived by his wife and two children.<br>
<br>Four animals bear Elton's name: <i>Camptocladius eltoni</i>, a small chironomid fly (with aquatic larvae), collected by Elton on Bear Island in 1921 and described by Edwards in 1922; <i>Micaria eltoni</i>, a male spider, collected by Elton at Klaas Billen Bay, Spitsbergen, in 1921 and described by Jackson in 1922; <i>Enchytraeus eltoni</i>, a small, white enchytraeid worm, collected by Elton at Liefde Bay, Spitsbergen, in 1923 and described by Stephenson in 1924; and <i>Eutrombicula</i> (S. G. <i>Eltonella</i>) <i>eltoni</i>, a tropical forest trombiculid mite (ectoparasitic on a scorpion in Malaya), described by Audy in 1956. The last was<blockquote>named for Charles Elton F.R.S. to whom ecologists and epidemiologists must be grateful for ideas and guiding principles in the sphere of animal ecology, and to whom the present writer is indebted in many ways, not the least being the example set of lucidity in writing on ecological subjects without a trace of the jargon and monstrous Greek derivatives which have ministered by cryptology and neologism to an esoteric obfuscation of ecological neoconcepts. (Audy, <span class="italic">Bulletin of the Raffles Museum</span>, 28, 1956, 36)</blockquote>Two ecological concepts, from Elton's first book, have also had his name appended to them by later writers: the &#145;Eltonian Pyramid of Numbers&#146;, and the &#145;Eltonian concept of Niche&#146; (as an animal's role in a community, contrasting with the habitat-niche used by the American ecologist J. Grinnell and others). The Elton Library, situated in the Bodleian's zoology library, houses the Bureau of Animal Population library, its research photographs and archives, and Elton's and the bureau's publications. Elton's Spitsbergen material and Wytham ecological survey material are now in the Hope collections in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.<br>
