<span class="headword">Robertson,  Eileen Arbuthnot</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>E. Arnot Robertson; <em>married name </em>Eileen Arbuthnot Turner, Lady Turner]</span>  (1903&#150;1961), <span class="occ">novelist and film critic</span>, was born on 20 January 1903 at Moor Cottage, South Holmwood, near Dorking, Surrey, the daughter of George Arbuthnot Robertson, a surgeon, and his wife, Elsie Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Binns; she had one sister, Maye (later Mrs Ernest Herbert Leslie White). Uprooted from an idyllic country childhood at Templeton, The Holmwood, Dorking, in 1917 she regretfully moved with her family to London, first to 27 Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, and then to 8 Kensington Park Road, Notting Hill. In order to distance herself from &#145;the stultifying atmosphere of a household resolved to escape all mental effort by way of laughter and/or water-sports&#146;  (Robertson, <span class="italic">Titles to Fame</span>, 186), she turned early to writing and became a precocious reader; by the age of eight she was able to recite R. M. Ballantyne's &#145;The Gorilla Hunters&#146; to her sister. After Greenwood School, Eastbourne, Eileen went to Sherborne School from January 1918 to July 1919, commenting in 1934, &#145;it is nice to feel that no misfortune that happens to me &hellip; can possibly make me quite as unhappy as I was there&#146;  (Robertson, <span class="italic">The Old School</span>, 153). For the following two years she was educated in France and in Switzerland.<br>
<br>By the age of nineteen Eileen Robertson was on the staff of the magazine <span class="italic">Answers</span> and years later &#145;still wonders uneasily whether any of the advice she handed out, on marriage, politics, investments and self-control was ever followed by readers who wrote in for it&#146;  (Norrie and Norrie, 167). At this time she was &#145;long limbed, needle thin with red-gold hair, anonymously famous as the model for a much reproduced painting <span class="italic">The Red Haired Girl</span> by James MacBey&#146;  (Devlin, introduction, <span class="italic">Ordinary Families</span>). On 26 February 1927, at Kensington register office, she married Henry Ernest Turner (1891&#150;1961), general secretary of the Empire (later Commonwealth) Press Union, who was the son of John George Turner, journalist. It was a successful marriage, &#145;very largely by his efforts. Emotionally she liked an audience and he provided it unstintingly &hellip; he was her mate in every sense and he was very happy&#146;  (ibid., quoting Gordon Turner). The Turners shared a passion for sailing and owned their own yacht. In the late 1920s they adopted a son, whom they called Gordon Hugh Clement Turner.<br>
<br>E. Arnot Robertson published her first novel, <span class="italic">Cullum</span>, about unrequited love for a &#145;philandering and unscrupulous male charmer and egotist&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Sept 1961), in 1928. Her second, <span class="italic">Three Came Unarmed</span>, published in the following year, described three orphans from Borneo, living with their aunt in West Mersea, Essex, who come up against &#145;the desire of the majority to see, to hear, to tolerate, no new thing&#146;  (E. A. Robertson, <span class="italic">Three Came Unarmed</span>, 1929, 300). These novels were successful but her next two, each of them a best-seller, were her masterpieces; both caused some consternation by their sexual explicitness. <span class="italic">Four Frightened People</span> (1931) is a brilliant adventure story, full of &#145;ruthless psychological dissection&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Sept 1961), &#145;with a clear-eyed objectivity which ranks it with Buchan or Haggard&#146;  (Ackroyd), set in the Malayan jungle; its author had not been there and backed &#145;the British Museum Reading Room against travel&#146;  (Devlin, introduction, <span class="italic">Four Frightened People</span>, x). (In fact she travelled widely, partly because of her husband's job.) She found her true voice in <span class="italic">Ordinary Families</span> (1933) with a &#145;rich, lightly malicious comedy of family affections&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Sept 1961) set in a Suffolk sailing village; after its publication critics such as Harold Nicolson placed her at the forefront of modern British novelists.<br>
<br>From 1936 to 1946 the Turners lived in London at 96 Heath Street, Hampstead, thereafter next door in the larger 98. It was Arnot, as she was known, who allegedly remarked that Hampstead is not just a place but a way of life. She worked for the Ministry of Information during the Second World War, was a frequent broadcaster, and after the war lectured to British forces in central Europe and north Africa. In 1947 she began a battle with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who found her reviews &#145;unnecessarily harmful to the film industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Sept 1961). Although the House of Lords found against her, the moral victory was hers: passionately individualistic, she was in part fighting &#145;sentimentality, over-statement, tradition, patriotism, cruelty, the self-regarding eye&#146; as well as frivolity, considered by her to be &#145;the worst thing about current English novels&#146;  (Robertson, <span class="italic">Titles to Fame</span>, 173, 186).<br>
<br>E. Arnot Robertson's last five novels (one of which was published posthumously) did not add to her reputation, for although she was &#145;at her best a writer of witty and ironical accomplishment, pointedly unromantic in temper&#146; and &#145;seemed at one time likely to develop into a novelist of considerable comic substance and power&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Sept 1961), this did not, alas, happen. By now rather eccentric, Arnot would walk about Hampstead in the &#145;old pair of trousers which was her usual garb&#146;  (private information, Ianthe Carswell), &#145;looking as though she had just stepped out of bed &hellip; resembling an elderly actor-manageress playing Ophelia&#146;  (private information, Ian Norrie). But she had many devoted friends and according to one was &#145;memorable to meet and unforgettable to know&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span> 28 Sept 1961). After her husband's accidental death untangling weeds round the propeller of their boat &#145;in the River Thames off Powells Wharf, Bermondsey&#146;  (probate declaration), Lady Turner, as she had become in 1951, &#145;simply felt that life wasn't worth living&#146;  (Gordon Turner, in Devlin, introduction, <span class="italic">Ordinary Families</span>) and on 21 September 1961, at her house in Hampstead, took an overdose of sleeping pills. Her body was cremated.<br>
