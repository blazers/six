<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maturin,  Charles Robert</span>  (1780&#150;1824), <span class="occ">writer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Dublin on 25 September 1780 (not 1782 as asserted by many previous sources), the last of the six children of William Maturin and his wife, Fidelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. On his father's side Maturin came from a long line of protestant clergymen, beginning with Gabriel Maturin, a Huguenot pastor who emigrated to Ireland in the seventeenth century. Pierre Maturin, Gabriel's son, had been dean of Killala, while Gabriel James Maturin, Charles Robert's grandfather, succeeded Swift in the deanery of St Patrick's. William Maturin departed from family tradition by entering government service where he enjoyed a lucrative career in the Post Office until November 1809 when he was dismissed on a false charge of malversation. Charles Robert Maturin entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1795. An active member of the Historical Society, he was awarded a scholarship before graduating with a BA in 1800. On 7 October 1803 Maturin married Henrietta Kingsbury, a society beauty famous for her musical accomplishments, who was also from a clerical family. According to one memoir, Maturin was &#145;the most uxorious man living&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, 11, 1819, 167). The Maturins had four children. The eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18352/', "William Maturin (1806&#150;1887)")</script>, was also a clergyman, while the second son, Edward (1812&#150;1881), emigrated to the USA where he was a professor of Greek and an author.<br>
<br>Maturin was ordained and appointed to the curacy of Loughrea, co. Galway, in 1803, returning to Dublin in 1804 as the curate of St Peter's. Although it was a highly fashionable church, the curacy carried a meagre stipend of &pound;80 to &pound;90 per annum. At his own expense Maturin published a Gothic romance, <span class="italic">The Fatal Revenge</span> (1807), under the &#145;vulgar and <i>merely</i> Irish sounding&#146; pseudonym of Dennis Jasper Murphy  (<span class="italic">Dublin and London Magazine</span>, 2, 1826, 248), followed by <span class="italic">The Wild Irish Boy</span> (1808). His father's dismissal from the Post Office in 1809 increased the financial pressure on Maturin. In that year he rented a house in York Street where he remained until his death, supplementing his income by tutoring students for entrance to Trinity. Maturin sold the copyright of his next romance, <span class="italic">The Milesian Chief</span> (1812), to Colburn for &pound;80. In 1810 Sir Walter Scott momentously reviewed <span class="italic">The Fatal Revenge</span> in the May issue of the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span>. Scott singled out Maturin's work from the &#145;flat imitations&#146; of Radcliffe, remarking that the evidently youthful author was talented, though wayward. He advised him to seek professional advice, which Maturin did by writing to Scott himself in 1812. Thereafter Scott guided Maturin, doing him innumerable favours, frequently interceding on his behalf, and, on at least one occasion, sending him money (&pound;50 in 1813). The resulting correspondence is the single best source of information about Maturin, with the bulk of it about <span class="italic">Bertram</span>. Maturin wrote his play in 1814, inspired by Richard Lalor Sheil's <span class="italic">Adelaide</span>, which had enjoyed a great success at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin. Worried that a Dublin production would injure his clerical reputation, Maturin turned to Scott for advice. Scott judiciously excised a scene in which the devil appears bodily on stage, and, after first trying John Kemble, sent the play to Byron, then on the newly formed management committee for Drury Lane. Byron was entranced by the text, and gave it to George Lamb, who also could not put it down. The play opened on 9 May 1816, and was a sensation, running to over forty performances. Murray published the amended version of the play, and even at the exorbitant price of 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. it went through at least seven editions within the year. Maturin received &pound;350 from Murray, and &pound;500 for his share of the box office. He visited London for a week in late May 1816 after the committee invited him to the capital to be lionized, but was intensely disappointed by his reception. It was Maturin's only trip outside Ireland.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Bertram</span>'s brilliant success brought out the flamboyant side of Maturin's character: &#145;tradesmen of all hues and callings were ordered to York-Street, to paint, furnish, and decorate, with suitable taste and splendour, the mansion of the great new-born tragic poet of Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Quarterly Review</span>, 2, 1852, 161). According to the memoirs he was extremely fond of dancing, especially the quadrille, which he prided himself in doing &#145;certainly better than any other divine of the Established Church&#146;  (ibid., 162). He would even darken &#145;his drawing-room window&#146;, and indulge his passion &#145;in the day-time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>, 46, 1855, 448). He was a notorious dandy:<blockquote>tall, slender, but well proportioned, and on the whole, a good figure, which he took care to display in a well made slack coat, tight buttoned, and some odd light-coloured stocking-web pantaloons, surmounted in winter by a coat of prodigious dimensions, gracefully thrown on, so as not to obscure the symmetry it affected to protect. (<span class="italic">Irish Quarterly Review</span>, 2, 1852, 160)</blockquote>Among other eccentricities, he was renowned for pasting &#145;a wafer on his forehead, whenever he felt the <i>estro</i> of composition coming on him&#146; as a sign to his family that he was not to be interrupted  (<span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>, 46, 1855, 448).<br>
<br>Maturin's next two plays flopped. <span class="italic">Manuel</span> (1817) was written for Kean, who wanted the opportunity to act the part of &#145;aged distress&#146;, given that <span class="italic">King Lear</span> was off-limits owing to sensitivities regarding George III's mental condition. Unfortunately, Kean lost interest after the first night, and sabotaged the play by walking through his part. <span class="italic">Fredolfo</span> (1819) also failed, while Maturin's final play, <span class="italic">Osmyn</span>, was mislaid by Kean. Maturin could not sustain these failures as after 1810 he was in terrible debt having stood security for a &#145;friend&#146; whose affairs collapsed. Meanwhile his clerical career had also stalled, owing, Maturin thought, to his novel-writing. After he had broken cover with <span class="italic">Bertram</span>, an article appeared in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> alleging his job was at risk, but enough fuss was caused to force Maturin's superiors into denying the rumours. Subsequent evidence suggests that the true reason for Maturin's lack of preferment was the eccentricity of his character and religious views. Maturin styled himself a &#145;high Calvinist&#146;, in opposition to the low Calvinism of nonconformist Methodism that was then popular in Dublin, but it was a stance which irritated the church hierarchy who largely held Arminian views.<br>
<br>One memoir claims that as a writer Maturin was apt unconsciously to adopt &#145;something of the last book he read&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal</span>, 19, 1827, 404); the reviews commented on his undisciplined originality. Both views have substance. <span class="italic">The Fatal Revenge</span> reveals Maturin's early love of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis while adding a new complexity to the genre through its exuberant proliferation of plot. <span class="italic">The Wild Irish Boy</span> and <span class="italic">The Milesian Chief</span>, though inspired by the examples of Maria Edgeworth and Lady Morgan, make significant contributions to the emerging genre of the Irish national tale. The early works up to and including <span class="italic">Bertram</span> reflect their Irish obsessions in often coded references to usurpation and dispossession. <span class="italic">Women, or, Pour and contre</span> (1818) marks a departure: the plot is once again based upon the story of a dispossessed and scattered family, but its main theme is salvation through faith. A satire on Methodism and depictions of Dublin undergraduate life are among its novelties.<br>
<br>In 1820 Maturin published his masterpiece, <span class="italic">Melmoth the Wanderer</span>, the book for which he is chiefly remembered. On the surface it is a return to the Gothic mode of his first romance, where he initially displayed his talent for &#145;darkening the gloomy, and of deepening the sad; of painting life in the extremes, and representing those struggles of passion when the soul trembles on the verge of the unlawful and the unhallowed&#146;  (preface, <span class="italic">The Milesian Chief</span>, 1812, iv&#150;v). However, it too carries on the religious preoccupations of his last phase. With its Chinese box structure of tales within tales, and its obsessive elaboration of its Faustian theme, it constitutes a high-water mark in the Gothic genre. On the surface its most salient quality is its anti-Catholic paranoia, but its real achievement is to invest the form with a new, poetic intensity. On the whole <span class="italic">Melmoth</span> was given a hostile reception on the grounds that Maturin impersonated his wicked characters with immoral eloquence. Maturin's last novel, <span class="italic">The Albigenses</span> (1824), was modelled on <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>, and is a historical romance based on the Cathar rebellion, a pre-Reformation setting apparently chosen for its uncontroversial nature. Maturin received &pound;510 for the copyright, &pound;10 more than for <span class="italic">Melmoth</span>. In 1819 Constable published Maturin's sermons which were a reasonable success, going into a second edition in 1821. His final work was <span class="italic">Five Sermons on the Errours of the Roman Catholic Church</span> (1824). Despite its title, it was equally aimed at the errors of nonconformity. Preached at St Peter's, the sermons were a sensation.<br>
<br>Maturin died on 30 October 1824 at his home, 37 York Street, Dublin, and was buried in the churchyard of St Peter's. The <span class="italic">Morning Register</span> reported that the &#145;immediate cause of Mr. Maturin's death was &hellip; his having taken a lotion, containing a large quantity of laudanum, in mistake for medicine intended for the stomach&#146;  (Henderson, 215). Although it has been much repeated, there is no evidence to substantiate the claim. This is typical of Maturin's biographical record; the numerous memoirs that appeared after his death had a tendency to recycle anecdotes and rumours, a situation worsened by the destruction of the Irish Public Record Office in 1922, and by Maturin's own mythopoeic tendencies. He had been particularly fond of relating different versions of the family history, and was notoriously evasive and inconsistent about his own financial difficulties in the early years of the nineteenth century. However, according to his widow, at his death he left his family &#145;totally unprovided for&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Scott and &hellip; Maturin</span>, 103). Scott agreed to publish Maturin's collected works, with a biography, but was prevented by his own financial difficulties. There was a rumour that William Maturin was so humiliated by his father's authorial reputation that he burnt all his papers, although this is contradicted by William's assiduity in promoting <span class="italic">Osmyn</span> after its discovery in 1825. The play was produced in Dublin for the benefit of the Maturin family by R. L. Sheil and W. C. Macready in 1830. Maturin was widely known throughout Europe, but especially in France, where all the major works were quickly translated. Balzac thought <span class="italic">Melmoth</span> &#145;the greatest creation of one of the greatest geniuses of Europe&#146;. Maturin's descendant Oscar Wilde honoured Maturin by adopting the sobriquet Sebastian Melmoth on his release from Reading gaol.<br>
