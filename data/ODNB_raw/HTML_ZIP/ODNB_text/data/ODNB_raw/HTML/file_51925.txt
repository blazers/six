<span class="headword">Overall,  Douglas</span>  (1892&#150;1978), <span class="occ">chartered surveyor and commercial property developer</span>, was born on 9 May 1892 at 18 Clifton Street, Brighton, the son of Frank Harry Overall, furniture salesman, and his wife, Sarah Jane Millard. He attended Brighton College for a time, where he studied engineering, but in 1913 he joined the commercial estate agents Hillier and Parker, becoming right-hand man to one of its founders, Tom Parker. During the First World War he was commissioned in the Royal Garrison Artillery. Mentioned in dispatches, he retired with the rank of captain. In 1919 he was made a partner with Hillier and Parker, and played an important role in the firm's merger with another prominent shops agency, May and Rowden, in 1921.<br>
<br>Together with Walter Stanley Edgson, Overall developed the merged practice, Hillier, Parker, May, and Rowden, as one of Britain's most important commercial chartered surveyors. While Edgson specialized in the London property market, Overall concentrated on the provinces. He played an important part in the establishment of a national commercial property market, developing a system for assembling information on shopping centres throughout Britain in order to meet the property needs of rapidly expanding multiple retailers such as Marks and Spencer, Boots, and Woolworths. In 1937 Overall, together with Edgson, became joint senior partner of Hillier Parker.<br>
<br>In addition to his work for the firm, Overall was engaged in the commercial property market as principal, as well as agent. In 1927 he established the property company Sterling Estates, which built up a portfolio of high street shop properties. Sterling was acquired by Royal Insurance in 1973, though Overall remained chairman until his death, by which time Sterling's portfolio was worth at least &pound;50 million. Overall also perceived the growing market for factories and built speculatively for letting on the industrial estates which mushroomed along London's arterial roads during the 1930s. He set up Industrial Estates, an offshoot of Sterling Estates, to develop and hold such factories.<br>
<br>Overall was also active in public life. During the war he was involved in the management of the air raid patrol, coordinating 1000 warden staff. He raised &pound;100,000 for the pilots and crews funds of the RAF, served as a justice of the peace, an additional commissioner for taxes, a governor of Putney Hospital, a member of the boards of many charities, and as a member of Westminster city council. He also became chairman of the Association of London Property Owners and the London Auction Mart. Overall married Dorothy Grace Waters (1890&#150;1978) about 1918. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Overall was a keen golfer. When he became a president of the Chartered Auctioneers and Estate Agents' Institute he was asked to open its golfing society. In front of a crowd of spectators he failed to hit an opening shot which was designed to mark the occasion. After he missed the ball a second time the crowd fell silent: Overall turned to his caddy and, with stiff upper lip, calmly remarked: &#145;That's a damn long course isn't it?&#146;  (private information). He retired from Hillier Parker in 1953, after which he devoted more of his time to running Sterling Estates. He died at his home, 102 Rivermead Court, Fulham, on 13 October 1978 at the age of eighty-six. His wife survived him by only five days. His son, Tony, also served as a director of Sterling Estates for fifteen years, before establishing his own property company.<br>
