<span class="headword">Allhusen,  Christian Augustus Henry</span>  (1806&#150;1890), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born on 2 December 1806 in Kiel, Germany, the fourth son in the family of five sons and two daughters of Carl Christian Allhusen, merchant of Kiel, and his wife, Anna Margaretha Schroder. The French occupation of Schleswig-Holstein caused the family to break up.<br>
<br>Allhusen's education is obscure; he worked in the grain trade, first at Rostock, then from 1825 at Newcastle upon Tyne with two older brothers. In 1827 his brothers left Newcastle and he invited Henry Bolckow, a Rostock friend, to join him in the grain trade; he was also involved in ship and insurance broking.<br>
<br>Allhusen married Anne, daughter of John Shield of Broomhaugh, in 1835; they had four sons and two daughters. His daughter Annie married twice, her second husband being Lord D'Arcy Godolphin Osborne, brother of the duke of Leeds.<br>
<br>Allhusen entered the Tyneside chemical industry at Gateshead in 1840 when he purchased the soap works of Charles Attwood &amp; Co. He was not a chemist but adopted innovatory methods and used commercial skill to promote his products. In 1862 he began drilling for salt on Teesside for manufacturing alkali by the Leblanc process on Tyneside. However, this benefited the rival Solvay process, then expanding on the Tees, and so in practice hastened the decline of the Tyneside industry.<br>
<br>Allhusen was a member of Gateshead town council from 1849 to 1853, an early president of the Newcastle chamber of commerce, and a Tyne commissioner from 1852 to 1855. An Anglican and liberal (later Liberal Unionist), he amassed a large fortune and his influence in the north-east was considerable. As an advocate of free trade, he supported Richard Cobden in his scheme for a commercial treaty with France in 1860, and represented local chemical manufacturers at the Paris conferences. To celebrate the treaty he invited W. E. Gladstone, chancellor of the exchequer, to visit Newcastle in 1862. Allhusen's business interests were varied; he was a director of the Marine Insurance Company, the Northfleet Coal and Ballast Company, the Brazil Great Southern Railway, the British Land and Mortgage Company of America, the International Bank of London, the New Oriental Bank Corporation, the Metropole Hotel Company, and the Newcastle and Gateshead Water Company. A major shareholder in the Northumberland and Durham District Bank, which failed in 1857, he managed to avert the closure of the Derwent Ironworks Company, which owed the bank &pound;1 million. In 1864 it was registered as the Consett Iron Company.<br>
<br>From 1842 Allhusen lived at Elswick Hall, Newcastle, but moved to Stoke Court, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, in 1873 and died there on 13 January 1890, not long after his wife. Soon after Allhusen's death his Tyneside factory was amalgamated in the United Alkali Company.<br>
