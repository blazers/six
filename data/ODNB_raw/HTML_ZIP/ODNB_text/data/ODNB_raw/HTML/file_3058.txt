<span class="headword">Bowes, Sir  Robert</span>  (1493?&#150;1555), <span class="occ">soldier, lawyer, and rebel</span>, was the second surviving son of Sir Ralph Bowes of Streatlam, co. Durham (<i>d</i>. 1512), and Marjorie (<i>d</i>. 1524), daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Conyers of South Cowton, North Riding of Yorkshire. He married Alice, a daughter of Sir James Metcalfe of Nappa, in Richmondshire; they had several children, all of whom died young. He became head of the Streatlam family following the death of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3049/', "Sir George Bowes (1517&#150;1545)")</script>. His background and experience in border defence and administrative affairs made Robert Bowes an ideal candidate for royal service in the north, a region where Tudor monarchs struggled to impose their authority. Like other members of his family Bowes had a natural aptitude for border warfare and gained early experience in this sphere during the Anglo-Scottish war of 1522&#150;3. Moreover, he gained wide-ranging expertise and an understanding of the wider political nation as a result of his education at Lincoln's Inn (admitted on 4 May 1511) and his pursuit of a legal career. In 1528 he was noted as a master of the court of requests.<br>
<br>The close connections between royal personnel and the Durham administrative &eacute;lite provided the channel by which Bowes was first able to enter royal service. He seems to have been a member of the episcopal council of Thomas Wolsey, bishop of Durham from 1523 to 1529, and was appointed escheator for the bishopric in 1529. His appointment to the council in the north in 1525, resurrected under Wolsey's auspices as the duke of Richmond's council, provided Bowes with the initial vehicle for his advancement in royal service. However, his career was undoubtedly furthered as a result of his participation, on the rebel side, in the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536. In joining the rebellion Bowes was motivated by political considerations: it appears that he, in company with other members of the northern gentry, had become increasingly alienated by the intrusions of central government in the affairs of the region. There is nothing to suggest that he rose in defence of the old religion. Bowes's role in the pilgrimage propelled him into the political limelight and to the notice of the crown, which quickly came to recognize his abilities in the spheres of both law and border defence. Following the breakdown of the rebellion Bowes was quickly reconciled with the Henrician regime, and thereafter began his rise as a faithful servant of the royal administration.<br>
<br>Bowes's legal and administrative expertise ensured his presence on the council in the north after its revitalization in 1537. He retained his seat on that body, serving in his later years as vice-president, until his death in 1555. He was knighted in 1539 and in the same year entered parliament as a knight of the shire for Yorkshire. His growing prominence in the political arena ensured his subsequent return as a member of parliament for Yorkshire in 1542 and for Newcastle upon Tyne in 1545, Westmorland in 1547, and Middlesex in 1553. At the same time his experience of border warfare ensured that he played a prominent role in the Anglo-Scottish hostilities of the 1540s. In 1545 he was appointed warden of the middle marches, and in 1548 his remit was extended to the east marches. In terms of border affairs, he became the acknowledged expert of his generation. His detailed survey of the state of the borders, drawn up in late 1550 or early 1551, is still highly regarded by historians for the insight it gives into the nature of frontier society in the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>By this time Bowes, whose family had become closely associated with the charismatic Scottish reformer John Knox, had become part of the reformist administration of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland. In terms of his legal career this connection enabled Bowes to reach the top of his profession with his appointment as master of the rolls in 1551. In the same year he became a member of the privy council, thus signalling his rise to the highest echelons of political society. Border service, however, remained the recurring theme throughout his career. In the closing years of his life when, following his support for the doomed attempt to settle the crown on the protestant Lady Jane Grey, Bowes was forced to resign his higher offices, the new Marian regime still had need of his expertise in Anglo-Scottish affairs. He died at Berwick on 28 February 1555 while reviewing the defences of the garrison there.<br>
