<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Venn,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1586, <em>d.</em> 1650), <span class="occ">parliamentarian activist and regicide</span>, was baptized at Lydiard St Lawrence in Somerset on 8 April 1586, the second son of Simon Venn, of yeoman stock, and his wife, Maud Lawrence. He was bound apprentice to the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1602, gained his freedom in 1610, and entered the livery in 1621. He became an assistant of the company in 1638, and warden in 1641&#150;3, but was to be excused service as master in 1648 because of his commitments as an MP. In 1619 at Chelsea, Middlesex, Venn married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1625), daughter of Henry Wood, a London merchant, with whom he had a son. His second marriage, by licence dated 13 February 1626, at West Ham, Essex, was to Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1594), daughter of Geoffrey Langley of Colchester, Essex, widow of John Elliot and of John Scarborough (salter and haberdasher of London respectively); they had a son and a daughter. Five other children from the two marriages died in infancy.<br>
<br>From at least 1621 Venn had a silk shop in Bread Street and was busy establishing himself as a substantial trader in wool and silk with the west of England and Ireland. Like several future leading parliamentarians he also developed an interest in America without, in his case, ever becoming actively involved in colonial trade. He was one of the original members of the Massachusetts Bay Company, joining its governing body in 1629 and attending its meetings in England, and he was still holding company stock in 1644. He corresponded with John Winthrop in Massachusetts and had apparently considered emigrating himself. Although far from being the impoverished merchant of later royalist propaganda, he was not a member of the City's mercantile &eacute;lite, only managing third rank in his ward in the 1640 listing of citizens according to their wealth.<br>
<br>Venn made an early impact in the civic arena. Having become a member of the Honourable Artillery Company in 1614, he gained prominence in City politics for the first time in 1631 when he was an unsuccessful anti-establishment candidate in a disputed artillery company election for the position of captain-leader. Nevertheless in subsequent years further promotion in the company followed&#151;from an assistant in 1632 to captain-sergeant-major in 1636 and deputy president under Alderman Thomas Soames in 1639. Around the same time Venn was securing officer rank in the London trained bands; he was a captain in 1616 and by 1642 had become a lieutenant-colonel in the Yellow regiment under Sir John Wollaston. His early military interests and experience stood him in good stead during the war years of the 1640s. In 1631 Venn was chosen as churchwarden of All Hallows, Bread Street, a London parish renowned for its puritanism, and throughout the 1630s he and his second wife regularly attended puritan religious meetings, where they made the close acquaintance of the zealous divine Christopher Love. From at least 1638 Venn was also a leading member of common council, serving during the next four years on seven committees including two terms on the highly influential City lands committee.<br>
<br>Exceptionally active in radical politics in the early 1640s, Venn apparently enjoyed close links with William Fiennes, Viscount Saye and Sele. He also developed a highly effective political partnership with Isaac Penington, a fellow City militant, which gave them considerable powers of co-ordination and direction over radical action in the capital, and he seems to have had close links with the Scottish commissioners sent to London. Venn was a key figure in the organization of the London petition to the king of September 1640, calling for a parliament and outlining grievances, and in spring 1641 he was at the forefront of the City campaign for the trial and execution of the earl of Strafford. His popularity at this time was such that when Matthew Cradock (one of the London MPs) died Venn replaced him at a by-election on 1 June and thereby joined Penington in the Commons. He was to prove a most active MP, being nominated to 300 committees during his time in parliament. The campaign for godly reformation of the Church also drew his enthusiastic support. In October 1641, for example, he gave his support in the Commons to parish zealots in St Giles Cripplegate who had denounced their curate and one of the churchwardens for blocking the implementation of reforms sanctioned by the Commons. He presented a petition of London ministers on 20 December opposing the use of prayers that ran counter to their consciences and calling for the setting up of a national synod to initiate reform. Venn was later to lead the zealots in his own parish of All Hallows, Bread Street, in their endeavour to gain the presbyterian Lazarus Seaman as their minister, and he was reported to have joined Penington in a Commons attack on the rector of St Matthew's Friday Street, designed to help restore the puritan dissident Henry Burton to the living.<br>
<br>In the turbulent closing weeks of 1641 Venn found himself in the political spotlight. This period opened with a reminder of the limits of his influence among his fellow citizens when he failed to dissuade common council from entertaining the king on his return from Scotland. Yet Venn soon attracted from two fellow MPs the not entirely unfounded accusation that he, and possibly Penington too, had been guilty of orchestrating mass demonstrations outside parliament, aimed at intimidating MPs, during the debate on the grand remonstrance. In addition he had something of a following among London apprentices. Again, like Penington, Venn acted as an intermediary and informant between the City and parliament&#151;most notably during the change of control over the London militia. Venn was also active in the campaign of July 1642 to remove the royalist Sir Richard Gurney from the mayoralty, thus clearing the way for Penington's promotion to that office. Both men later shared with two other citizens the distinction of being identified as traitors by the king for their role in disaffecting London from him.<br>
<br>Venn became a leading supporter of parliament's war effort. He helped to raise subscriptions of money, plate, and horse and provide the capital with gunpowder. On the outbreak of hostilities he became a colonel of foot in parliament's army and fought at Worcester on 23 September 1642. Appointed governor of Windsor Castle on the following 28 October, he successfully withstood an early attack by Prince Rupert and remained a constant threat to the royalists. Christopher Love, who had been appointed chaplain to Venn's regiment, joined Venn and his family in Windsor where he continued to exercise a strong influence over them. Venn also ensured that St George's Chapel was subjected to a godly purge. Removed from the governorship in June 1645 under the self-denying ordinance, he returned to London to continue his support for the war effort and became a prominent member of the army committee.<br>
<br>Despite his admiration for the presbyterian Love, Venn became a leading London Independent and, after the attempted presbyterian counter-revolution of 1647, he was appointed to the Independent-dominated London militia committee of September 1647. After the second civil war he was appointed to the high court of justice for the king's trial and was present at all but two of its sittings; he signed the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. He was a busy committeeman in the Rump Parliament with army and financial matters claiming much of his attention. Venn's sudden and unexpected death during the night of 27&#150;28 June 1650 gave rise to groundless rumours of suicide. His widow, Margaret, was the main beneficiary of his will, proved on 1 July, in which he left property in London, Somerset, and three other counties, and a debt of &pound;4000 still due to him for his expenses at Windsor and a further &pound;140 owed by the trustees for bishops' lands. Not long after his death his widow married Thomas Weld, an Independent divine. After the Restoration Venn's estates were said to have been forfeited for regicide. A diary kept by his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69139/', "Anne (or Hannah) Venn")</script> was published posthumously in 1658 while his son Thomas wrote <span class="italic">Military and maritine [<i>sic</i>] discipline</span> in 1672 and later became mayor of Bridgwater.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28187"></a><span class="headword">John Venn</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1647, <em>d.</em> 1687), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Venn's cousin Simon Venn of Lydiard St Lawrence, and his wife, Jane. Baptized at Combe Florey, Somerset, on 17 August 1647, he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 10 May 1662, graduated BA in 1666, and proceeded MA in 1669; he was created BD and DD in 1685. He married Catherine Lowe, sister of Sir Edward Lowe, one of the masters in chancery. A fellow of Balliol, Venn was master of the college from 1678 to 1687 and vice-chancellor of the university in 1686&#150;7. He also enjoyed clerical livings in Lincolnshire and Oxfordshire and, unlike his namesake, was a fervent upholder of church orthodoxy. He died on 8 October 1687 and was buried in Lydiard St Lawrence where he left an estate in his will, which was proved on 4 May 1688.<br>
