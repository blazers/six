<span class="headword">Bevan,  John Henry</span>  (1894&#150;1978), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and stockbroker</span>, was born on 5 April 1894, at 4 Lower Berkeley Street, London, the younger son of David Augustus Bevan (1856&#150;1937), stockbroker, and his wife, the Hon. Dame Maude Elizabeth Bevan (1856&#150;1944). Educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, Bevan was commissioned as a territorial in the Hertfordshire regiment in October 1913 and served on the western front during the First World War, being twice mentioned in dispatches and winning the MC as a captain in 1917. In January 1918 he joined the specially selected staff of Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson at the supreme war council as a GSO2; his speciality was writing strategic appreciations from the enemy's point of view during the great German offensives in spring 1918. After the war he spent three years with Hambros bank in Copenhagen before returning to the City to join the stockbroking firm founded by his father. In 1927 he married Lady Barbara Bingham (1902&#150;1963), daughter of the fifth earl of Lucan; they had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>A Territorial Army reservist, Bevan was recalled in 1939, working first in MI5 before joining as a major the staff of <i>Mauriceforce</i> for the ill-starred campaign in Norway. His career in strategic deception did not begin until his appointment as controlling officer by the chiefs of staff on 21 May 1942. Systematic, organized deception, as practised on an unheard-of scale during the Second World War, had its origins in the Middle East in 1940 under the sponsorship of General Sir Archibald Wavell and Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke of A force. Yet it was only in the early 1970s that their achievements and those subsequently of Bevan's London controlling section began to receive the historiographical acknowledgement they deserved, thanks to the release of official sources following the <span class="roman">Public Records Act</span> of 1967 and the publication of Sir John Masterman's <span class="italic">The Double-Cross System in the War of 1939 to 1945</span> in 1972.<br>
<br>In appointing Johnny Bevan, the chiefs of staff found an officer with the necessary combination of imagination, initiative, resilience, and sound military instincts, to say nothing of personal charm and persuasiveness. &#145;His most remarkable feature was a very fine forehead, both broad and deep; and one of his greatest assets an extraordinarily attractive smile&#146;, according to the novelist Dennis Wheatley, a member of the London controlling section  (Wheatley, 59). The new controlling officer had to start from scratch&#151;almost singlehandedly planning the cover and deception for operation Torch (the invasion of north Africa), winning the confidence of the prime minister and the chiefs of staff, and developing as wide a range of contacts as possible so as to &#145;sell&#146; deception. Ever present was the strain of playing with dynamite, intensified for Bevan by recurrent insomnia. The main UK-based deception in 1943 misfired but the system was preserved, a system based on an unprecedented combination of watertight security and superb intelligence. MI5 had decided in June 1942 that they did indeed control all <i>Abwehr</i> agents in the country and from then on the latter were used with growing confidence for deception purposes; moreover, ULTRA intelligence made it possible to monitor the credibility of the agents with their controllers and to identify those strategic presuppositions of Hitler's that could most profitably be played up to mystify and mislead him. For no operation was it more urgent to induce Hitler to make &#145;a calculated false move&#146;  (Wingate, &#145;Narrative&#146;, 1.4) than the cross-channel invasion in 1944.<br>
<br>Bevan and the London controlling section made a decisive contribution to the success of operation Overlord. Their primary function was to co-ordinate deception between theatres of operation and to formulate overall deception policy. This they fulfilled for the invasion by drawing up plan Bodyguard, the grand strategic deception for 1944, as well as implementing a number of supporting schemes involving liaison with a wide range of authorities from the Foreign Office to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Bevan himself flew to Moscow, barely surviving a defective oxygen mask, to arrange Soviet co-operation with Bodyguard. The tactical cover plan for the cross-channel assault was, as always, planned and executed by the operational headquarters concerned, in this case the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). By this stage of the war large-scale visual deception had been reduced to a form of insurance against chance sightings by sporadic German aerial reconnaissance. To an extent totally unforeseen in 1942, reliance was now put upon the XX (or double-cross) agents, in particular Garbo and Brutus, backed up by bogus wireless traffic to &#145;validate&#146; an inflated order of battle in the UK. Bevan was one of a handful of officers representing SHAEF, MI5, and the London controlling section, who worked quickly and at times off the record to preserve surprise for the assault and to put across Major Roger Hesketh's brilliant &#145;story&#146; that the D-day landings were mere preliminaries to a more powerful invasion of the Pas-de-Calais, thereby pinning German reserves north of the Seine while the battle for Normandy was decided.<br>
<br>Appointed CB in 1945, Bevan returned to stockbroking; he also became chairman of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. His recreations remained those of the countryman, particularly gardening and ornithology. Once a year he hosted a dinner at Brooks's Club for his wartime associates, mostly majors and colonels, whose conventional background and appearance concealed such a rich talent for ingenuity and guile. Bevan died at the age of eighty-four of lung cancer on 3 December 1978 at 232 Cranmer Court, Sloane Avenue, London, and his body was cremated.<br>
