<span class="headword">Topham,  Edward</span>  (1751&#150;1820), <span class="occ">journalist and playwright</span>, was born in York in 1751 and baptized there on 17 June 1751, probably the sixth of at least eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66942/', "Francis Topham LLD (c.1713&#150;1770)")</script>, master of faculties and commissar of the exchequer and prerogative court of the York diocese. When Topham was seven his father, an ambitious and powerful church lawyer, tried to procure, and believed he had obtained, for him the promise of the reversion of his lucrative commissaryship. Dean Fountayne, supported by Archbishop Hutton, flatly denied any such undertaking, and Dr Topham's self-righteous anger at being forsworn erupted into a pamphlet war, initiated by his <span class="italic">Letter address'd to the dean of York; in which is given a full detail of some very extraordinary behaviour</span> (1758). Employed by the dean to reply was the vicar of Coxwold, Laurence Sterne, who launched into his own literary career with <span class="italic">A Political Romance, Addressed to &#151;&#151;, Esq., of York</span> (1759; reissued 1769, reprinted as <span class="italic">The History of a Good Warm Watchcoat</span>), an extended lampoon, in which Dr Topham was cast as Trim, a village sexton.<br>
<br>Edward Topham was sent to Eton College in 1756 or 1757 and remained there eleven years. There is some doubt over his reported involvement in the boys' mass protest against Dr Foster's rule in November 1768. Frederick Reynolds, who became a close friend through Topham's interest in the theatre, recounts Topham's story of participation in a subordinate role, but the claims that he was a leader of the rebellion (including in his own over-embellished account in &#145;The schools&#146;, <span class="italic">World</span>, 15 November 1787) are not substantiated in other sources. Moreover, the Cambridge University records state that he was enrolled as a pensioner at Trinity College (22 April 1767), over a year before the revolt took place, though Topham may not have taken up residence until his admission as fellow-commoner on 23 October 1769. Topham did not study very seriously at Cambridge, where he became known for his ability as an engraver of humorous subjects: his reputation was sufficient for Horace Walpole to want to add examples of his work to his growing collection. He left without taking a degree.<br>
<br>After a period travelling on the continent Topham spent six months in Scotland, mainly in Edinburgh, and then published <span class="italic">Letters from Edinburgh, 1774 and 1775</span> (1776), containing &#145;Observations on the diversions, customs, manners, and laws of the Scotch nation&#146;. In 1777 he published the tory pamphlet &#145;Address to Edmund Burke on affairs in America&#146;. In the same year he purchased an army commission, as cornet in the King's 2nd Horse Guards, of which regiment he served for about seven years as adjutant. Having earned the gratitude of George III for his efficiency in bringing his soldiers up to scratch, he was caricatured in print shops as &#145;the tip-top adjutant&#146;.<br>
<br>Topham was a leader of fashion of the day. Reynolds describes his &#145;short scarlet coat, with large cut steel buttons; a very short white waistcoat, top-boots, and leather breeches, so long in their upper quarters, as almost to reach his chin&#146;, in contrast to the long coats and waistcoats and short breeches normally worn at this period  (Reynolds, 2.39). Conspicuous as a man of fashion even at a period when singularity of dress or manner was not unusual, Topham featured in several of Reynolds's comedies and the playwright later commented that his &#145;profits on Topham alone &hellip; must have amounted to upwards of one thousand pounds&#146;  (ibid., 2.46).<br>
<br>During the Gordon riots in London in June 1780 Topham distinguished himself in command of a small detachment of cavalry, though accounts vary as to whether he acted in defence of Parliament Square or Buckingham House. He was promoted to captain in 1782. In 1783 he acted as second to Captain George Riddell of the Horse Grenadiers in his (illegal) duel with Captain Cunningham of the Scots Greys. Seriously wounded, Riddell was conveyed to Topham's house in Bryanstone Street, where he shortly afterwards died. On his retirement Topham acquired the rank of major.<br>
<br>Topham was well acquainted with many prominent political and theatrical personalities, including Wilkes, Pitt, the Colmans, and Sheridan. His direct association with the theatre began in the summer of 1779, when he contributed a prologue to <span class="italic">A Widow and No Widow</span> by his friend R. P. Jodrell, the first of many prologues and epilogues for plays by Miles Peter Andrews, Mrs Inchbald, Reynolds, Thomas Morton, and others, which (apart from a break between 1786 and 1791) he continued to write on a fairly regular basis until 1795. For his efforts in this vein he became known as Captain Epilogue. Topham turned to playwriting in 1780. He wrote several farces, the earliest of which, <span class="italic">Deaf Indeed</span> (1780), was damned on the first night and never performed again. More successful were <span class="italic">The Fool</span> (1785), <span class="italic">Small Talk, or, The Westminster Boy</span> (1786), and <span class="italic">Bonds without Judgement</span> (1787). In all three pieces there were roles for the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29016/', "Mary Stephens (Becky) Wells (1762&#150;1829)")</script>, with whom Topham began a liaison during the mid-1780s. The dedicatee of the published text of his second play, <span class="italic">The Fool</span>, in which she had a big success as Laura, Mrs Wells also spoke a specially written &#145;Epilogue-Prologue&#146; in the character of Macheath, her principal role in the main piece of the evening, <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. In Topham's third play, chosen for a benefit performance, her appearance in the second act dressed as a Westminster scholar caused uproar from the claque of Westminster boys, purposely present, and the remainder of the play could not be heard.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1787 Topham began a daily newspaper entitled the <span class="italic">World and Fashionable Advertiser</span>. Originally it was designed to puff Mrs Wells, but according to James Winston, she took over a large part of its conduct over several years, including sending reports from the Hastings trials. Other associates on the paper included Miles Peter Andrews, the Revd Charles Este, and the publisher John Bell (1745&#150;1831), who had a share in the management. Hannah More, referring to its emphasis on &#145;elopements, divorces, and suicides&#146;, described the paper as full of &#145;elegant periods and sublimated nonsense&#146;  (Walpole, 31.265). The first productions of the mainly Florentine-based band of English poets noted for their flamboyant sentimental verse, known as the Della Cruscans, made their first appearance in the <span class="italic">World</span>. Among Topham's own contributions were his sometimes unreliable recollections of Eton and the earliest version of his <span class="italic">Life of the Late John Elwes</span> (first published 1790 in book form; 12th edn, 1805), the memoir of a notorious miser who lived at Stoke in Suffolk, close to Topham's villa Cowslip Hall (so-called after the nickname Mrs Wells acquired as heroine of O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">The Agreeable Surprise</span>, 1781). Topham was proud of his achievement in having persuaded Elwes to settle his money on his children. In Reynolds's opinion this biography exhibited &#145;so perfect a picture of character and eccentricity, as ever to render any other account of its subject wholly supererogatory&#146;  (Reynolds, 2.36).<br>
<br>The proclivities of Topham's newspaper the <span class="italic">World</span> for scandal and gossip eventually and inevitably landed him in trouble with the courts. He was accused of libelling the memory of the late George Nassau Clavering, third Earl Cowper (<i>d</i>. Florence, 22 December 1789). When a guilty verdict was returned, Topham appealed, on grounds of misdirection of the jury. After protracted legal wrangling it was allowed (<i>King v. Topham</i>, 1791) on the grounds that there had been no intention &#145;to create any ill blood, or to throw any scandal on the family and posterity of Lord Cowper, or to induce them to break the peace in vindicating the honour of the family&#146;  (Pollock, 347), a judgment still applied as precedent. Meanwhile, by autumn 1790, the partnership between Topham and Este had broken up after a quarrel over the financial arrangements, Este having allegedly surrendered his quarter share in the paper in 1788 in return for an annuity. A dispute ensued through Topham's refusal to pay, largely conducted through the columns of <span class="italic">The Oracle</span>, and, in January 1793, by reference to the courts. The British Library copy of Este's <span class="italic">My Own Life</span> (1787) includes cuttings of <span class="italic">The Oracle</span> letters, headed in manuscript &#145;The Rev. Mr Este's appeal to the publick&#146;.<br>
<br>Topham disposed of the encumbrance of the <span class="italic">World</span> in 1792, at about the same time abandoning Mrs Wells for another actress. He retreated with their three children (Maria Cowslip, Harriet, and Juliet)&#151;a fourth died at birth&#151;to his native Yorkshire, to Wold Cottage, a substantial dwelling near Thwing, where he took to farming several hundred acres of land and breeding greyhounds, among them the pre-eminently swift black greyhound called Snowball. A product of this period of semi-retirement was his publication of a new annotated edition of Somerville's poem <span class="italic">The Chase</span> (1804), with a sketch of the author's life.<br>
<br>An event of major astronomical significance took place on Topham's property at Wold Cottage about 3 p.m. on Sunday 13 December 1795, when a large meteorite weighing 56 lb fell to earth two fields from the house, the noise of impact being heard as far away as Bridlington. Topham was absent in London at the time but his estate workers retrieved the object and Topham soon realized its significance both as a phenomenon worthy of exhibition and as a money-making enterprise. The circumstances of the fall were recounted in Topham's letter to James Boaden's newspaper <span class="italic">The Oracle</span> (12 February 1796; later reprinted in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, 1797, with additional testimonials and an engraving). Handbills were distributed and advertisements taken out in newspapers advising of the stone's public exhibition &#145;for the inspection of the curious&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 July 1796). It was transported to London, where, opposite the Gloucester Coffee House, at 2 Piccadilly, it was shown to visitors on payment of a shilling fee, for which they received as a souvenir &#145;an exact Engraving of the Stone&#146; and copies of authenticating testimonials by witnesses  (ibid.). A quarto pamphlet entitled &#145;An account of a remarkable stone which fell from the clouds&#146; was published by Topham in 1798 and in 1799 he erected a brick column on the spot, within sight of Wold Cottage, where the meteor had landed. Several years later, in 1804, Topham sold what was left of the stone&#151;substantial pieces having already been given away&#151;to James Sowerby for his private museum in London. After 1837 it eventually passed, via the British Museum and former South Kensington Museum, to the Natural History Museum, London, where it is still exhibited as the &#145;Wold Cottage meteorite&#146;. In the collections are contemporary illustrations of the meteor, including the tinted engraving originally done by Topham's daughter Harriet for Sowerby's museum. The event's continuing importance lies in the fact that it is &#145;the oldest recorded fall on the British mainland for which a sample remains&#146; and because it played a significant part in the acceptance of meteorites as stones from the sky  (Pillinger and Pillinger, 589).<br>
<br>A self-described wit and noted conversationalist, Topham was active in the exclusive Lion Club (of which there were only thirteen members, including Reynolds, Miles Peter Andrews, and Robert Merry). He was known to a very wide circle and was described as in temper &#145;easy and companionable&#146; and &#145;a warm and zealous friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1820, 469). In physical appearance he was distinguished by a set of &#145;immense whiskers&#146;, often referred to by the future George IV as &#145;his great bird's nests&#146;  (Reynolds, 2.29). Politically prominent, man of fashion and womanizer, Topham was in youth a continual subject of caricature. He was, for instance, depicted in James Gillray's &#145;Thunderer&#146; (20 August 1782) as a windmill, together with the prince of Wales and the actress Mrs Perdita Robinson, with whom he had a short relationship in the early 1780s, after she was cast off by her royal lover; and Rowlandson shows him (5 October 1785) as &#145;Captain Epilogue to the [Mrs] Wells&#146;.<br>
<br>A more sober side to Topham's personality made him active in the magistracy in Suffolk and in the north and east ridings of Yorkshire, where he was also deputy lieutenant. A devoted father to his daughters and a liberal landowner, he was a keen promoter of the science of agricultural improvement. Topham died unmarried in his sixty-ninth year at Doncaster on 26 April 1820. He was survived by two daughters, Maria and Juliet, who, like their deceased sister Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1810), were renowned Yorkshire beauties and accomplished horsewomen.<br>
