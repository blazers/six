<span class="headword">Ashby,  Arthur Wilfred</span>  (1886&#150;1953), <span class="occ">agricultural economist</span>, was born in the Warwickshire village of Tysoe on 19 August 1886, the eldest of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73036/', "Joseph Ashby (1859&#150;1919)")</script>, farmer and surveyor, and his wife and cousin, Hannah Ashby (<i>b</i>. 1861/2). His father was a remarkable man whose life, as told by his daughter, is the classic story of the articulate village leader of the second half of the nineteenth century for whom religion, farming, and politics were the stuff of life. Having left the village school a little before his twelfth birthday, young Ashby spent the next eleven years helping his father in the multifarious duties of small farmer, self-taught surveyor, Methodist lay preacher, poor-law guardian, organizer of village clubs, and local agent for the Liberal Party. This apprenticeship to a robust heritage laid the foundation for his lifelong study of rural society.<br>
<br>Ashby's orderly studies started in 1909 when he went to Ruskin College, Oxford, with a Charles Buxton scholarship. There he took the diploma (with distinction) in economics and political science (1911) and wrote his contribution on the administration of the poor law (1912) for <span class="italic">Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History</span> edited by Paul Vinogradoff. In 1912 the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries awarded him the first of its scholarships in agricultural economics. This took him in turn to the newly founded Institute for Research in Agricultural Economics at Oxford and to the University of Wisconsin, where he was honorary fellow in political science.<br>
<br>In 1915 Ashby returned to the Oxford institute to study the history of allotments and smallholdings; his book (1917) on this topic has not been superseded. From 1917 to 1919 he was seconded to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, where he had a big share in shaping the first Agricultural Wages Board and in the work of the food production department. Back at the institute he was senior research assistant, and in 1922 he married Rhoda, daughter of John Dean Bland. They had one son, who also became an agricultural economist.<br>
<br>In 1924 Ashby went to Aberystwyth as head of the new department of agricultural economics in the University College of Wales. His work there was recognized by his elevation in 1929 to the first professorship in agricultural economics in the UK. In 1946 it was entirely fitting that he should return to the institute at Oxford to succeed C. S. Orwin as director; he held the post until his retirement in 1952.<br>
<br>Ashby was a prominent member of the small group who were pioneers in the study of agricultural economics as a subject in its own right. It was his efforts which led, in the face of considerable opposition, to the formation in 1926 of the Agricultural Economics Society, of which he was twice president. He was also a founder member and, from 1949 to 1952, a vice-president of the International Conference of Agricultural Economists. Through his contributions to teaching, to research, and to policy over a period of forty years he made a decisive and enduring impact on the development of his chosen subject.<br>
<br>Ashby's undoubted greatness as a teacher was given full scope with his translation to Aberystwyth. His deliberate manner of speaking coupled with his tall and dignified presence was always calculated to command full attention, but it needed the encouragement of sympathetic Welsh farmer audiences to mould the halting lecturer of earlier years into the familiar platform figure who spoke with such confidence and authority. On returning to Oxford in 1946 he used his twenty years' experience in Wales to give a new emphasis to the teaching side of the work of the institute. Both at Aberystwyth and at Oxford he attracted students from all over the world. Having himself been denied the educational advantages that usually lead to an academic career, he was particularly sympathetic to overseas students; when he visited India in 1949 to advise on the development of agricultural economics it gave him great pleasure to be greeted by old pupils.<br>
<br>Ashby was equally gifted as a director of research, for he was indefatigable both as instigator of original work and as supervisor of advanced studies. He was himself a prolific contributor to the literature of his subject. His writings are scattered in many journals: a selected list representative of their wide range is given in the <span class="italic">Journal of Agricultural Economics</span> (vol. 12, 1956). Many of his most stimulating contributions were made, however, in extempore discussions at conferences and meetings. Some of the best of these contributions will be found fully indexed in the <span class="italic">Journal of Proceedings</span> of the Agricultural Economics Society and in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the International Conference of Agricultural Economists, which also contain some of his more important papers.<br>
<br>Ashby's background meant that to him agricultural economics could never be an arid exercise. Hence his untiring work on the many official and voluntary bodies on which he served from 1919 onwards. Three of these are worth special mention because they concerned causes in which he had a special interest. First, his membership of several important marketing committees in the inter-war years gave him the chance to propagate his profound belief in the efficacy of co-operation. His knowledge of milk marketing was probably unequalled, and, in the background, he played a big part in designing the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales. Second, as an appointed member of the Agricultural Wages Board from 1924 onwards he was able to use his influence in the furtherance of good relations between master and man on the farm. Finally, he welcomed the opportunity, which service on the awarding committee for scholarships to the sons and daughters of rural workers gave him, to express his lifelong interest in the education of country children.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Ashby remained true to his radical-reformist upbringing. In politics he was a supporter of the Labour Party, yet successive Labour governments failed to utilize effectively his unrivalled knowledge of the problems facing British agriculture.<br>
<br>Ashby was a shy, reserved person with a touch of the suspicious caution of the typical countryman. In academic circles he was never entirely at ease and he never rid himself completely of a certain nervous tension in public, characteristics which led him, on occasion, to do less than justice to himself. But he was essentially a kind and friendly man, always generous with his help to those, especially young people, who sought it. His sense of humour was of the quiet kind; he loved to hear a good story and to chuckle loudly at one of his own.<br>
<br>In 1923 Ashby received the honorary degree of MA from the University of Oxford (and MA by decree in 1946), and he was elected a fellow of Lincoln College in 1947. He was appointed CBE in 1946. A justice of the peace, he sat on the bench both in Cardiganshire (1940&#150;46) and in Oxfordshire (1946&#150;53). He became a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture (1951) and a member of the Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland (1953). Ashby died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 9 September 1953.<br>
