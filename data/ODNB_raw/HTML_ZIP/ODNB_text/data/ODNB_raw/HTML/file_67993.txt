<span class="headword">Sidney <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gamage]</span>,  Barbara</span>, countess of Leicester  (<em>c.</em>1559&#150;1621), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the only child of John Gamage (<i>d</i>. 1584), lord of the manor of Coety in Glamorgan, and his wife, Gwenllian, daughter of Sir Thomas ap Jenkin Powell of Glynogwr and widow of Watkin Thomas. On her father's death in September 1584 Barbara's marriage became an important bargaining counter in Welsh political infighting. She was courted by her cousins Thomas Jones of Abermarlais, Sir James Whitney of Whitney, and Herbert Croft of Croft Castle; the privy council and Lord Burghley (acting in his capacity as master of the wards) and her influential uncles Sir Walter Ralegh and Lord Howard of Effingham sent contradictory instructions. But her guardian, Sir Edward Stradling, succumbed to even more powerful persuasions and accepted the suit of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25524/', "Robert Sidney (1563&#150;1626)")</script>, younger brother of Sir Philip Sidney. Robert's father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25520/', "Sir Henry Sidney")</script>, was lord president of the council in the marches (and the leading opponent of the Croft faction on the council) and the family was connected by marriage with the earl of Leicester, Sir Francis Walsingham, and the earl of Pembroke. According to one tradition, it was Barbara who was attracted to young Sidney and persuaded her guardian to approve him. More conventional accounts emphasize that Barbara was married within weeks of her father's death to a man she had probably never met before, and one whose family connections were diametrically opposed to her own.<br>
<br>Whichever version of events is nearer the truth, it was apparently a happy and successful marriage. Barbara Sidney's local influence provided Robert with the county seat for Glamorgan in the parliaments of 1584&#150;5 and 1593, and her estates helped to restore the Sidneys' overstretched finances. She may have accompanied him on the campaign of 1585&#150;6 in which his elder brother, Philip, was killed. She certainly went with him to Flushing, where he was governor, in 1590 and 1592 and again in 1597&#150;8. Her early experiences may have left her vulnerable and insecure: on the rare occasions when they were apart, Robert's letters to her are full of anxious reassurance. Unfortunately, none of her letters to him has survived, though there are references to them in letters from others. It is even possible that she was unable to write and dictated her letters to an amanuensis, though the personal tone of Robert's letters to her suggests they were written for her own eyes.<br>
<br>As both her confidence and their family grew (she and Robert had eleven children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25525/', "Robert Sidney")</script> and the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30082/', "Lady Mary Wroth")</script>), Barbara Sidney spent more time at Penshurst, with occasional and reluctant visits to London. At Penshurst she kept house in the traditional Welsh manner with a household that was unfashionably large by English standards. She seems to have been equally unfashionable in her devotion to her children. She was unwilling to leave them in England when she visited the Netherlands, and she kept her eldest son at home long after her husband considered he should have been sent to a tutor. While Sidney was absent in Flushing she was his representative at court and with the influential members of their family connection, especially with his sister, the gifted and distinguished Mary Herbert, countess of Pembroke. Barbara appears never to have returned to Wales after her marriage, though she maintained her connections there and Sidney planned to send her there for safety during the Armada crisis. She died in 1621, and was buried at Penshurst on 26 May 1621.<br>
