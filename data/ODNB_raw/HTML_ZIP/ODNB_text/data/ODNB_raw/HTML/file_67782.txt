<span class="headword">Richardson,  Charlotte Caroline</span>  (1796&#150;1854), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born on 15 May 1796 in Lambeth, London, the youngest of the three daughters of Robert Richardson (<i>d</i>. 1804), clerk, and Elizabeth Smales (<i>c</i>.1759&#150;1841). When Charlotte's father died in 1804, her mother opened a boarding-school in Vauxhall, in order to combine a source of income with supervision of the education of her older daughters, but she sent the youngest to live with an aunt in Hinderwell, Yorkshire. What had begun as a temporary measure was prolonged for more than ten years, apparently contrary to the wishes of both mother and daughter.<br>
<br>Charlotte Richardson's parents had become acquainted through the pages of the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span>, an almanac that featured verse enigmas, charades, and rebuses, along with prose mathematical puzzles, and offered prizes for verse answers. The mode of question and reply fostered a degree of courtly flirtation between the various contributors, and Robert Richardson, who had been contributing since the 1780s, was so taken with the contributions of Miss Smales that he tracked her down and after a short correspondence they were married. Charlotte Caroline in turn seems to have regained contact with her mother by publishing a poem in the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span> in 1815, identifying herself as the youngest daughter of Mrs Richardson, &#145;formerly Betty Smales&#146;. Mrs Richardson, who was familiar to readers by both names, replied in a poem the following year, greeting her &#145;long-lost child&#146;, and in the meantime arrangements were made for Charlotte to visit her family in London. The two generations of Richardsons were steady contributors to the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span> (and its successor the <span class="italic">Lady's and Gentleman's Diary</span>) for over seventy years, Charlotte's sisters Elizabeth Anne (later Mrs Baker) and Eleanor (later Mrs Long) playing their part, and in 1846 Charlotte and Elizabeth Anne edited a volume of their mother's <span class="italic">Poems</span>, drawn from her contributions, and provided a memoir of her life.<br>
<br>Charlotte, however, was the most successful writer in the family. Her brief volume <span class="italic">Waterloo, a Poem on the Late Victory</span> (1817) and her book of verse for children, <span class="italic">Isaac and Rebecca</span>, of the same year, were followed by the more ambitious <span class="italic">Harvest, a Poem, in Two Parts: with other Poetical Pieces</span> (1818), which was dedicated to the mathematician Charles Hutton, editor of the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span>. Charlotte's last substantial work was a complicated &#145;legendary tale&#146;, <span class="italic">Ludolph, or, The Light of Nature, a Poem</span> (1823). Her sentimental-gothic novel, <span class="italic">The Soldier's Child, or, Virtue Triumphant</span> (1823) was not well received, but it contains a minor character called Clara Roberts whose childhood closely parallels Charlotte's and may reflect her feelings about having been separated from her family. Charlotte continued to write for the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span> until the year of her death, and contributed occasional verse to other periodicals such as <span class="italic">Pawsey's Ladies Fashionable Repository</span>.<br>
<br>On 5 November 1827 Charlotte married John Richardson, a wharfinger; they do not seem to have had any children. Thereafter she styled herself variously Mrs Charlotte Caroline Richardson, Mrs C. C. Richardson, and, after her mother's death in 1841, Mrs Richardson of Vauxhall. As a consequence she has been regularly confused in library catalogues and elsewhere with her mother and with Mrs Charlotte Richardson of York and Mrs C. E. Richardson of Dumfries. She died after an attack of paralysis on 29 March 1854 at her home, 25 Vauxhall Street, Vauxhall, Surrey.<br>
