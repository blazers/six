<span class="headword">Watson,  James</span>  (1799&#150;1874), <span class="occ">radical and publisher</span>, was born at Malton, Yorkshire, on 21 September 1799. His father died when he was barely a year old. His mother, &#145;a Sunday school teacher&#146;, taught him to read and write. About 1811 she returned to domestic service in the family of a clergyman who had paid for James's schooling for a period. The boy became under-gardener, stable-help, and house servant, and acquired a strong taste for reading over the kitchen fire in winter evenings. About 1817 the parson's household was broken up, and Watson accompanied his mother to Leeds, where he became a warehouseman. Two years later he was converted to free thought and radicalism by public readings from Cobbett and Richard Carlile. For the next few years he took an active part in disseminating advanced literature and in getting up a subscription on behalf of Carlile.<br>
<br>After Carlile was sentenced in 1821 to three years' imprisonment for blasphemy, Watson went to London in September 1822 to serve as a volunteer assistant in his Water Lane bookshop. In January 1823 Carlile's wife, having completed her term of imprisonment, took a new shop at 210 Strand. Watson moved there, still in the capacity of salesman. The occupation was a perilous one, and, despite all the precautions taken, salesman after salesman was arrested. This fate overtook Watson at the end of February 1823. He was charged with &#145;maliciously&#146; selling a copy of Palmer's <span class="italic">Principles of Nature</span> to a police agent, and, having made an eloquent speech in his own defence, was sent to Coldbath Fields prison for a year. There he read Hume, Gibbon, and Mosheim's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span>, and was strongly confirmed in his anti-Christian and republican opinions. During 1825 he became a compositor, and was employed in printing Carlile's <span class="italic">Republican</span>, and for some time in conducting his business. In the intervals of work he suffered privation, and in 1826 was struck down by cholera. When he recovered, he became a convert to the co-operative schemes of Robert Owen, and in 1828 he was storekeeper of the First Co-operative Trading Association in London in Red Lion Square and was a member of the British Association for the Promotion of Co-operation (1829&#150;35) and the National Union of the Working Classes (1831&#150;8). He became a bookseller in 1830 and worked with Hetherington, Cleave, and Lovett in the production and the distribution of the <span class="italic">Poor Man's Guardian</span>. In December 1832 he launched the <span class="italic">Working Man's Friend and Political Magazine</span>, an influential journal advocating factory legislation, universal suffrage, and repeal of both the newspaper duty and the union with Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1831 Watson set up as a printer and publisher, and the following year he was arrested and narrowly escaped imprisonment for organizing a procession and a feast on the day the government had ordained &#145;a general fast&#146; on account of the ravages of the cholera. In February 1833 he was summoned at Bow Street for selling Hetherington's <span class="italic">Poor Man's Guardian</span>, and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment at Clerkenwell. His championship of the right to free expression of opinion had won him admirers, and one of these, Julian Hibbert, on his death in January 1834, left Watson 450 guineas, with which sum he promptly enlarged his printing plant. He made a bold start by printing the life and works of Tom Paine, and these volumes were followed by Mirabaud's <span class="italic">System of Nature</span> and Volney's <span class="italic">Ruins of Empires</span>. Later he printed Byron's <span class="italic">Cain</span> and <span class="italic">Vision of Judgment</span>, Shelley's <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span> and <span class="italic">Masque of Anarchy</span>, and Clark on the miracles of Christ. All these were printed, corrected, folded, and sewn by Watson himself, and issued at 1<i>s</i>. or less per volume. His shop near Bunhill Fields (from where he removed first to the City Road, and in 1843 to 5 Paul's Alley) was well known to all the leading radicals of the day, and he had &#145;pleasant and informing words for all who sought his wares&#146;.<br>
<br>Watson married Eleanor Byerley on 3 June 1834, and two months later was arrested and imprisoned for six months for having circulated Hetherington's unstamped paper, the ironically entitled <span class="italic">Conservative</span>. He had a little earlier come under government surveillance as a leader in the great April meeting of trade unions in support of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. He bore imprisonment with resignation: &#145;I love privacy&#146;, he wrote to his wife. This was his last imprisonment, though he continued without intermission to issue books upon the government &#145;index&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1836 Watson helped to found the Working Men's Association, and in June 1837 he was on the committee appointed to draw up the <span class="roman">People's Charter</span>. He opposed both physical force and the overtures made to whig partisans, whom he consistently denounced for their selfishness. He remained constant in his demands for &#145;the charter, the whole charter, and nothing but the charter&#146;. In 1848 he was one of the conveners of the first public meeting to celebrate the French revolution of that year. In 1847 he had given his adherence to the People's International League founded by his friend and correspondent Mazzini.<br>
<br>Frugal, severe, and self-denying in his habits, Watson was a thin, haggard, thoughtful man, with an intellectual face and a grave yet gentle manner. He was a publicist and organizer rather than an editor or leader. He lost money through his publishing, his object being profitable reading for uneducated people rather than personal gain. Yet he cared for the correctness and decent appearance of his books, even the cheapest. &#145;They were his children, he had none other.&#146; An unstamped and absolutely free press became the practical object of his later years, and he led the Newspaper Stamp Abolition Committee in 1849.<br>
<br>About 1870 anxiety about the health of his wife induced a serious decline of Watson's own powers. He died at his home, Burns Cottage, Hamilton Road, Lower Norwood, London, on 29 November 1874, and was buried in Norwood cemetery, where a grey granite obelisk erected by friends commemorated his &#145;brave efforts to secure the rights of free speech&#146;.<br>
