<span class="headword">Pinder,  John Hothersall</span>  (1794&#150;1868), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 27 April 1794 in Barbados, the eldest son of Francis Ford Pinder (1767&#150;1843) and his first wife, Elizabeth Christian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maynard (1769&#150;1799). He was educated at Charterhouse and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1816 and MA in 1824. Ordained deacon in 1818 and priest in 1819 in London, he returned to Barbados and served as chaplain of Codrington plantation. There he married, on 16 August 1819, Anne Brathwaite (1795/6&#150;1892), daughter of Scawen Kenrick Gibbons. They had a son who died in infancy in Barbados.<br>
<br>In 1830 Pinder became first principal of Codrington College, Barbados, founded to train clergy for the diocese of Barbados and the Leeward Islands. In 1834 Pinder appointed Hurrell Froude, a close associate of Keble and Newman, as mathematics tutor. Froude subsequently reported to Newman, &#145;I have secured the Principal of Codrington College as an ally and he will be able to prejudice several of the clergy who have been through his hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Diaries of J. H. Newman</span>, ed. T. Gornall, 5, 1981, 12). However, in 1835 Pinder relinquished his post through ill health and returned to England as curate of St Mary's, Lambeth, where George D'Oyly (1778&#150;1846) was rector. Pinder was subsequently principal of Partis College, Bath.<br>
<br>Froude's claim to have converted Pinder to the views of the Oxford Movement may have been an exaggeration. In lectures delivered at Codrington in 1830 Pinder emphasized that bishops were the successors of the apostles and stressed the mystical nature of the church. All his publications stress the apostolic origins of the three-fold ministry, and the pre-Reformation and primitive origins of the liturgies of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. In his view, because the English church had existed for nearly 600 years before the time of Augustine &#145;without interference from Rome&#146; it was not bound by papal supremacy. At the Reformation he believed it had rejected the &#145;errors with which human wickedness or craft had disfigured the work of God&#146;. Such views identify him with the older generation of high-churchmen such as Archbishop Howley of Canterbury and Bishop Kaye of Lincoln.<br>
<br>In 1839 Pinder was appointed the first principal of Wells Theological College. The college at Wells was established by a small group of mainly high-church clergy and laymen, who included F. H. Dickinson (1812&#150;1890), J. T. Law (1790&#150;1876), W. T. P. Brymer (<i>d</i>. 1852), and Lord John Thynne (1798&#150;1881), acting at the suggestion of Henry Manning, archdeacon of Chichester, where a similar institution had been founded. One of the few men in England with experience of training candidates for the clergy, Pinder immediately proved a capable and energetic principal. He restricted recruitment to graduates, and established a one-year course in doctrine, polity, liturgy, and pastoral theology, which included visiting, teaching, and preaching under the supervision of parish clergy. The college had no &#145;common life&#146;. Students lived in approved lodgings and were required to attend daily morning and evening prayer in the Vicars' Close Chapel. By 1842 there were seventeen students and a vice-principal was appointed. By 1844 there were twenty-eight students. In 1846 Pinder became a residentiary canon and precentor of Wells Cathedral. Despite some suspicions of Tractarianism the college flourished under Pinder and provided an example for Samuel Wilberforce when founding his diocesan college at Cuddesdon in 1854 and for Walter Hamilton in founding his college at Salisbury in 1864. Pinder's success lay in retaining a small but able group of staff, and avoiding extremes of churchmanship.<br>
<br>Increasingly hindered by deafness, Pinder retired to West Malvern in 1865, and died there on 16 April 1868. On his retirement former students had contributed the then considerable sum from clergy stipends of &pound;2500 to endow the college.<br>
