<span class="headword">Ua Briain,  Domnall M&oacute;r</span> <span class="st"> [Donal O'Brien]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1194), <span class="occ">king of Thomond</span>, was the son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (<i>d</i>. 1167), king of Thomond. He became king in 1168, blinding his brother, Brian, in the same year. His marriage to &Oacute;rlaith, daughter of Diarmait Mac Murchada (<i>d</i>. 1171), king of Leinster, may be presumed to have taken place following his accession and Mac Murchada's return from exile with Anglo-Norman mercenaries. In 1170 Mac Murchada sent Anglo-Norman forces to assist Ua Briain in repelling an invasion by Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht, and contender for the high-kingship. The following year Ruaidr&iacute; took hostages from Domnall and they besieged the Anglo-Norman garrison in Dublin together; but subsequently Ua Briain campaigned in Osraige with his brother-in-law, Richard fitz Gilbert, earl of Pembroke and lord of Striguil, known as Strongbow. On Henry II's arrival, Ua Briain submitted to him, thereby rejecting the high-kingship of Ruaidri Ua Conchobair.<br>
<br>In 1173 Ua Briain destroyed the castle of Kilkenny following the retreat to Waterford by the Anglo-Norman garrison in advance of his forces and the next year he overcame an Anglo-Norman raiding party at Thurles, which suffered heavy casualties. In 1175 he treacherously slew a son of Mac Gilla P&aacute;traic, king of Osraige, and blinded dynastic rivals, Diarmait and Mathgamain Ua Briain, in his residence at Caisl&eacute;n U&iacute; Chonaing (Castleconnell, Limerick). Ruaidri Ua Conchobair took retaliatory action for this deed by attempting to remove Ua Briain from the kingship of Thomond. Ruaidr&iacute; may have sought to use the treaty of Windsor, negotiated with Henry II in 1175, to wrest control of the city of Limerick from Domnall; but the Anglo-Norman garrison (which installed itself in Limerick in 1175) abandoned the city to Ua Briain in 1176 and Limerick was not retaken by Anglo-Normans until after his death. The importance of his control of Limerick is evidenced by his use of the title king of Limerick in his charters; he was described likewise by Gerald of Wales and in the so-called <span class="italic">Song of Dermot and the Earl</span>. During the expedition to Ireland of John, son of Henry II, in 1185, the Anglo-Norman garrison of Ardfinnan was twice attacked and suffered fatalities at Ua Briain's hands, although he himself incurred casualties inflicted by the Anglo-Norman garrison of Tibberaghny. In 1192 he won a significant military victory over an Anglo-Norman force at Thurles and in 1193 the castle of Briginis (Breckinish Island in the Shannon estuary) was built by Anglo-Normans &#145;with the consent of Ua Briain&#146; as a check on Domnall Mac Carthaig, king of Desmond.<br>
<br>An original charter in favour of the Cistercian abbey of Holycross, which Ua Briain founded, survives, as well as a charter-text in favour of Brictius, bishop of Limerick. He was responsible for embellishing St Mary's Cathedral in Limerick as well as the cathedral church of St Flannan, Killaloe, of which his brother, Consaid&iacute;n, was bishop from 1179 to 1194. Ua Briain successfully reconstituted the kingship of Thomond, which had been seriously weakened following the defeat incurred by his father, Toirdelbach, at the battle of M&oacute;in M&oacute;r in 1151. In 1177 Henry II made a speculative grant of the &#145;kingdom of Limerick&#146; to Philip de Briouze but it remained unrealized during Domnall's lifetime. He retained his kingdom intact against incursions by the Meic Carthaig of Desmond, the Meic Gilla P&aacute;traic of Osraige, and the U&iacute; Conchobair of Connacht, as well as by Anglo-Normans. Some annals style him king of Munster at his death in 1194. Domnall's death was followed by bitter disputes between his three sons. It was ultimately the second of these, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20451/', "Donnchad Cairprech &#211; Briain")</script>, who established himself as king of Thomond, while his elder brother, Muirchertach Finn, became king of Limerick.<br>
