<span class="headword">Raphael,  Ralph Alexander</span>  (1921&#150;1998), <span class="occ">organic chemist</span>, was born on 1 January 1921 in Croydon, Surrey, the only son and eldest of four children of Jacob (Jack) Raphael (1889&#150;1978), a master tailor, and his wife, Lily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woolf (1892&#150;1956). His father, whose family moved to Britain from Poland towards the end of the nineteenth century, was a moderately Orthodox Jew who found it difficult to stay in steady work during the depression, so Raphael's early schooling was disjointed, and included spells at schools in Leeds, Sunderland, and Dublin, as well as in London. His talent for science and mathematics having been discovered and nurtured at Tottenham county school (1936&#150;9), he studied chemistry at Imperial College, graduating from the wartime two-year course in 1941 with first class honours and the Hofmann prize for practical chemistry. Under E. R. H. (Ewart) Jones's supervision he completed a brilliantly successful two-year PhD thesis, which fired his lifelong enthusiasm for the chemistry of acetylenes. In 1943 he was sent to May and Baker Ltd under wartime government direction to work on the newly discovered antibiotic penicillin. On 23 May 1944 he married Prudence Marguerite Anne Gaffikin (<i>b</i>. 1922), a violinist, and daughter of Colonel Dr P. J. Gaffikin, medical officer of health for Maidstone; they remained happily together for the rest of his life and had two children, Richard Anthony 
    (Tony; <i>b</i>. 1945)
  , later a research chemist, and Sonia Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1952), later a schoolteacher. Raphael turned away from religion entirely in 1941.<br>
<br>Raphael returned to Imperial College in 1946 as an ICI research fellow. His imaginative research on the applications of acetylenes in organic synthesis was recognized in 1948 by the award of the Meldola medal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry. He was appointed lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 1949, and then moved in 1954 to become the first professor of organic chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast, where he built up a successful new department and published an influential monograph, <span class="italic">Acetylenic Compounds in Organic Synthesis</span> (1955). He was called back to Glasgow in 1957 to be regius professor of chemistry, a post he held until moving to Cambridge in 1972.<br>
<br>Raphael's tenure in Glasgow saw the greatest blossoming of his scientific work, including pioneering syntheses of shikimic acid (an important intermediate in amino acid biosynthesis), queen bee substance (a key insect pheromone), and chrysanthemic acid (a component of natural insecticides). In recognition of his contributions he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1958 and of the Royal Society in 1962, and was awarded the Chemical Society's Tilden medal in 1960. He was a popular teacher and an inspiring research supervisor, his period at Glasgow producing a generation of outstanding organic chemists including both academics (including J. R. Maxwell FRS, R. Ramage FRS, A. I. Scott FRS, and W. Parker, who died prematurely) and pharmaceutical company executives (including P. Doyle and T. McKillop, both of ICI/Zeneca). He was also a highly effective collaborator, notably with Geoffrey Eglinton in devising applications for gas-liquid chromatography.<br>
<br>In 1972 Raphael was elected 1702 professor of organic chemistry at Cambridge, as successor to Lord Todd. This position carried with it the headship of the department of organic, inorganic, and theoretical chemistry; the separate department of physical chemistry shared the same building and facilities, an arrangement which did not always lead to comfortable relationships between the two departments. At Cambridge, Raphael continued to produce a stream of innovative and elegant natural product syntheses, including virantmycin (an antiviral compound), aaptamine (an &#945;-adrenoceptor blocker), and steganacin (an anti-leukaemic). He received the Pedler medal of the Chemical Society in 1973, its Ciba-Geigy award in 1975, and the Davy medal of the Royal Society in 1981, and was appointed CBE in 1982. He also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Stirling and East Anglia (both 1982), and from Queen's University, Belfast (1989). He became a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1972, and was elected an honorary fellow on his retirement in 1988. Above all he valued his fellowship of Imperial College, awarded in 1991.<br>
<br>As head of department Raphael encouraged his younger staff to explore new and unconventional areas of science. He defined his success not in selfish terms of his own scientific or monetary triumphs, but through the collective achievements of his department, and he took great pleasure in the success of some of those he had appointed, particularly A. B. Holmes FRS, J. K. M. Sanders FRS, and C. Abell. His style did not sit easily with the accountancy-led world of the 1980s: he saw the university as publicly funded for the benefit of the country, and he gave his scientific advice freely. Within the department and elsewhere he was a popular and avuncular figure, always available for constructive advice or an amusing but relevant anecdote.<br>
<br>Although most of his research fell within the conventional boundaries of organic chemistry, Raphael's broader interests, particularly in music, were displayed in some of his more unusual research papers, and he collaborated with David Rubio (a Cambridge violin maker) to produce modern preparations that replicated some of the warm tones of the instruments of Stradivarius and the Cremona school. He retired in 1988, but retained a lively interest in chemistry, reading the latest papers enthusiastically until a few weeks before his death from ischaemic heart disease at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 27 April 1998. His body was donated to the university's department of anatomy and then cremated, on 1 June 1999. He was survived by his wife and two children.<br>
