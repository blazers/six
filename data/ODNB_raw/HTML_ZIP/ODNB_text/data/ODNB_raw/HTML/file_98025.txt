<span class="headword">Haden,  George</span>  (1788&#150;1856), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born in Handsworth, Birmingham, on 23 July 1788, the second son and third of five children of George Haden (1756&#150;1822), foreman of the copying machine shop at Boulton Watt &amp; Co., and his wife, Sarah Ann Shakespeare (1754&#150;1792). He was apprenticed at the age of fifteen for a period of five years to Boulton Watt &amp; Co. at their Soho, Birmingham, manufactory, working on the construction of steam engines and boilers. When he was about twenty-one he was sent out on the road by the firm as a travelling agent and engineer assembling, erecting, and commissioning Boulton and Watt steam engines manufactured at the Soho works.<br>
<br>Haden's first job, in December 1809, took him to the north of England erecting an engine for Birley and Hornby in Manchester. He then worked on the construction of the Leeds gasworks before moving to Scotland, where he spent five years in the construction of the Cranston Hill waterworks in Glasgow. He also erected numerous steam engines elsewhere in Scotland. After living in lodging houses away from his home for so long, and missing the close family ties with his father and siblings, he became disenchanted and wrote of his disgruntlement with his way of life and his earnings. In 1814 he was sent by Boulton and Watt as their agent to the west of England, where there was an increasing demand for steam engines to power the machinery in the woollen mills being built in Somerset, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire. Among the clients for whom Haden erected steam engines was the woollen firm, at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, of J. and T. Clark. Haden was much taken with the town of Trowbridge, reporting in a letter to his father dated March 1815 that it was a thriving place for business. Several mill owners offered to subscribe to pay him to look after their engines, which he reckoned would take less than half his time, leaving the remainder free to undertake other business. He set up home in Trowbridge with his wife, Ann Nelson (1790&#150;1819), whom he had married at Harborne, Staffordshire, on 1 May 1816. Their first child, George Nelson Haden, was born in the following year; his wife died shortly after the birth of their second child, Benjamin.<br>
<br>Haden was joined in Trowbridge by his brother James Haden (1790&#150;1871), who had also served an apprenticeship at the Soho works, and they rapidly expanded their activities to include millwrighting work, repairing and maintaining the machinery of the woollen mills. In 1816 they set up the firm of G. and J. Haden, which as well as erecting steam engines and undertaking millwright work entered the newly emerging industry of heating and ventilating, by the manufacture of warm air stoves. Being a bachelor James was able to become the partner in the firm who travelled the country erecting, supervising, and taking orders for the installation of warm air stoves and expanding the firm's business. Their early clients included landed gentry, and in 1826 they installed warm air stoves at Windsor Castle for George IV. During the 1830s and 1840s the firm undertook increasing amounts of business for public buildings, notably lunatic asylums and prisons (including Parkhurst and Pentonville); in the following decades, much of their work involved installing warm air ventilation systems in churches, using air ducts covered by gratings in the aisles. Their stoves were also installed at Lambeth Palace, Bowood House, Hillsborough Castle, Gosford House, Penrhyn Castle, and many other places. The four patents taken out between 1829 and 1842 by George Haden included improvements to the effectiveness of warm air stoves (patent no. 5773 of 1829, 6561 of 1834, 7927 of 1842, 9259 of 1842). James retired from the firm in 1855, and the partnership was renamed George Haden &amp; Son.<br>
<br>George Haden was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1834, and was often selected as an umpire in professional arbitrations. He was an active member of the Tabernacle Congregational church in Trowbridge, was for thirty years superintendent of the Sunday school, and was also a supporter of the Mechanics' Institute in the town, where his firm employed large numbers of local people. He married, second, on 12 December 1844, a widow, Christiana Hicks (1785/6&#150;1854) of Trowbridge, daughter of John Wilson, grocer. After a short illness he died at his home in Polebarn Lane, Trowbridge, from kidney failure, on 29 October 1856, and was buried in the family grave in Trowbridge.<br>
<br>The firm continued to be managed by George Haden's surviving son, George Nelson Haden (1817&#150;1892), whose warm air installations included the British Museum and the hotel at St Pancras station; he also designed a hard labour crank that was widely used in prisons. His two sons William Nelson Haden (1859&#150;1946) and Charles Ingham Haden (1863&#150;1947) became chairman and managing director and ran the company until the late 1930s. William Nelson Haden's son, George Nelson Haden (1900&#150;1960), chairman from 1938 to 1958 and the last link between the firm and the Haden family, installed the hypocaust system of heating in Liverpool's Anglican cathedral, and in 1933 the air conditioning system for the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.<br>
