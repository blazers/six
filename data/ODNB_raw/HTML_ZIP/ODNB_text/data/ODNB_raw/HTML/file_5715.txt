<span class="headword">Clowes,  John</span>  (1743&#150;1831), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Swedenborgian preacher</span>, was born at Manchester on 20 October 1743 and baptized at St Ann's Church there on 17 November, the fourth son of Joseph Clowes, barrister, and Catherine, daughter of the Revd Edward Edwards, possibly curate of Llanbedr, near Ruthin. Clowes was only seven or eight years old when his mother died but she laid the foundation of his religious education, which was continued by his equally devout father. He was subsequently schooled at the Revd John Clayton's academy at Salford, and possibly also at the grammar school there. At the age of eighteen, in 1761, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where his tutor was Dr Richard Watson, future bishop of Llandaff, with whom he remained on friendly terms in later life. In January 1766 he graduated BA. During the next three years, while working as a private tutor, he took two prizes for Latin essays and was elected fellow of Trinity; he proceeded MA in 1769. Having abandoned his original idea of entering his father's profession he had prepared for holy orders and was ordained in 1767 by Bishop Richard Terrick. Illness meant that he could no longer continue tutoring, and when on 13 August 1769 he was offered the rectorship of St John's, Manchester, a position he had previously rejected, he accepted. St John's Church had only recently been built by his relative Edward Byrom, son of the poet John Byrom.<br>
<br>Still in delicate health Clowes felt himself unprepared for his vocation in other ways. In this diffident state of mind he one day came across a copy of William Law's <span class="italic">Christian Perfection</span>. The book had a profound effect on him and led him to study Law's other works as well as the writings of sundry English, French, and German mystics. In 1773 he was introduced to the writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg by Richard Houghton of Liverpool, who advised him to purchase a copy of Swedenborg's <span class="italic">True Christian Religion</span>. Through Houghton, Clowes became acquainted with the Revd Thomas Hartley, rector of Winwick, Northamptonshire, and the earliest translator into English of any of Swedenborg's works. The study of Swedenborg's writings proved a lifelong commitment for Clowes and he spent many years translating them. His first published translation was the <span class="italic">Vera Christiana religio</span> (1781), which was followed by four other works.<br>
<br>Soon after his conversion Clowes consulted with Hartley in London as to the propriety of remaining an Anglican clergyman. This was the only meeting in person between the two men and Hartley urged him to remain in the Church of England. Clowes followed his advice and remained rector of St John's, in spite of occasional opposition from his own curate, among others. Several pamphlets were published against him, and finally an appeal was made in 1783 to his bishop, Dr Beilby Porteus. The bishop dealt very gently with Clowes and dismissed him with a friendly caution to be on his guard against adversaries. However, Clowes remained involved in controversies over his Swedenborgian doctrines throughout his life. As well as preaching these doctrines from his pulpit he organized twice-weekly meetings, from which there sprang up in the manufacturing towns and villages around Manchester many popular Swedenborgian societies. In 1782 he founded a Society of Gentlemen, renamed the Manchester Printing Society in 1801 (which still exists as part of the North of England New Church House), for the purpose of printing and circulating the writings of Swedenborg and tracts on his teaching.<br>
<br>In 1787 at a meeting in London the followers of Swedenborg resolved to separate from what they called the old church and in 1792 the New Jerusalem Church in Peter Street, Manchester, was opened. This action was taken against Clowes's wishes and he made several trips to London to speak against it, but it did not prevent him from continuing to hold communion with his fellow believers. He became closely associated with the meeting at Hawkstone Park, Shropshire, held from 1806 by those who chose not to separate from the established church. He was a firm monarchist, who believed that &#145;governors should derive their rank and authority, not from the people whom they govern, but from the Head under which they govern&#146;  (Compton, 167). He was thus indignant when Abbe Barruel identified Swedenborgianism with Jacobinism; Clowes wrote his <span class="italic">Letters to a Member of Parliament</span> (1799) specifically to refute this claim. In 1804 he declined a bishopric offered to him by William Pitt on the recommendation of Baron Graham, although he did accept the chaplaincy of the Manchester Volunteers. The fiftieth anniversary of his induction to St John's was commemorated by the erection in the church of a bas-relief tablet, sculptured by John Flaxman, himself a Swedenborgian and a personal friend of Clowes, and by the painting of a portrait by John Allen, which was placed in the vestry.<br>
<br>Clowes was taken ill in 1823 while visiting Birmingham and was unable to return to Manchester. He died at Leamington on 29 May 1831 in his eighty-eighth year, and was buried at St John's, Manchester, on 9 June. The records of the Manchester Printing Society in 1828 showed that nearly 200,000 copies of sermons, pamphlets, and tracts by Clowes had been published. Among them were many reflecting his early interest in the Sunday schools movement. Many of his tracts for children were collected together as <span class="italic">Religious Instruction for Youth</span> (1812).<br>
