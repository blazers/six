<span class="headword">Baring,  Edward Charles</span>, first Baron Revelstoke  (1828&#150;1897), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 13 April 1828, the fifth son of Henry Baring (1776&#150;1848), a merchant banker, and the second son of his second marriage, to Cecilia Anne (<i>d</i>. 1874), the daughter of Admiral Windham of Felbrigg in Norfolk. His grandfather was the merchant and founder of the house of Barings, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1382/', "Sir Francis Baring (1740&#150;1810)")</script>, his father was a junior partner of Baring Brothers, and his brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30583/', "Evelyn Baring, first earl of Cromer (1841&#150;1917)")</script>. He was educated at Rugby School. On 30 April 1861 he married Louisa Emily Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1892), the daughter of John Crocker Bulteel, of Flete and Lyneham, Devon, from a Devon banking family. Of their seven sons and three daughters, the eldest surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37152/', "John Baring (1863&#150;1929)")</script>, became Barings' senior partner while another son was the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30584/', "Maurice Baring (1874&#150;1945)")</script>; two others died in infancy.<br>
<br>About 1850 Edward entered Barings as a clerk, and a year later he was sent &#145;with procuration&#146;  (Bates, diary, vol. 4, 16 Dec 1850) to their Liverpool house. On his return to London in 1854 he received power of signature with annual remuneration of &pound;1000. Admission as a full partner followed two years later. &#145;He is sharp at a bargain&#146;, reckoned Joshua Bates, a senior partner who had little good to say of any of his juniors, &#145;but slovenly in keeping his accounts, inexact in his calculations and I doubt his judgements, expensive in habits but he likes business&#146;  (ibid., vol. 6, 1 Jan 1856). The other senior partner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1385/', "Thomas Baring (1799&#150;1873)")</script>, eventually agreed, but failed to curb Baring's influence, along with that of another junior, Russell Sturgis.<br>
<br>After Thomas Baring's death in 1873, Baring and Sturgis led Barings, and from 1883 Baring was undisputed leader. His share of the profits (and, if need be, the losses) rose steadily from 18/144ths in 1870 to 26/120ths in 1887, yet his capital contribution was modest. It stood at &pound;50,000 in 1885, when total capital exceeded &pound;2 million, but recovered to &pound;220,000 by 1889. Barings, in most years, was highly profitable, but Baring did not plough back his profits; instead he withdrew them to fund an extravagant life&#151;not least his acquisition of a 4000 acre estate and house at Membland, Noss Mayo, south Devon, and an opulent London house at 37 Charles Street, Mayfair. Everything was done with generosity and style; niggardliness was not in his character.<br>
<br>At Barings, Baring managed rapid growth in bond issuing, at a time when London's role as a supplier of international capital grew dramatically. Between 1873 and 1890 about eighty issues were handled, mostly for governments and railway companies in the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Russia, but also in many other countries besides. His management of trade finance, an important source of regular income, was at arm's length, while under his leadership Barings' work as merchants withered. He initiated issues for home businesses such as Whitbreads, the Manchester Ship Canal, and, not least, Guinness, which he floated with great profit but corresponding controversy. His other achievements included funding the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, after which the town of Revelstoke was named in his honour. In the same year his elevation as Baron Revelstoke recognized his importance as an international banker. The Bank of England appointed him a director from 1879 to 1891 and he was Lloyds' chairman from 1887 to 1892.<br>
<br>In the 1880s many of Barings' transactions were high risk and unprofitable. Bad debts written off in 1883 exceeded &pound;150,000, and those the following year were more than &pound;260,000. A huge bond issue for the Italian government almost brought ruin in 1882. Then in 1888 a &pound;10 million issue for the Buenos Aires Water Supply and Drainage Company was inadequately underwritten and poorly taken up, causing a liquidity crisis at Barings in November 1890. In what was known as the Baring crisis, Barings' collapse and a major financial panic were avoided only by a Bank of England loan.<br>
<br>Revelstoke's judgement was held responsible. &#145;There is really no excuse for Ned&#146;, wrote his brother, &#145;he has been reckless &hellip; loosing his head from success, departing from all the old rules and traditions of the firm and doing things inconceivably foolish&#146;  (ING Barings, DEP 84). The price Revelstoke now paid was enormous. He retired disgraced, his wife died prematurely, and his assets were sold to meet his firm's debts. But his integrity and honour were never doubted. He died at 37 Charles Street on 17 July 1897, a broken man in straitened circumstances, but gratified that, under his son's leadership, Barings had paid its debts and was regaining much of its prestige.<br>
