<span class="headword">Lewis,  Paul</span>  (1739<span class="mult">x</span>41&#150;1763), <span class="occ">highwayman</span>, was born either in Ireland or at Herstmonceux, Sussex. He was one of ten children of an Anglican clergyman and appears to have come from a respectable family: Lewis himself drew attention to the good character of his ancestry in a plea against his death sentence, identifying a family line related to Archbishop William Laud and grandfathers who had served as chaplains at the Tower of London and to Lord Scarbrough.<br>
<br>When aged about six Lewis was sent to a &#145;good Foundation-school&#146; where he remained for six or seven years but made no progress, &#145;such was his Incapacity, so impenetrable his Head to the Rudiments of Learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 4.271). On his removal from the school, Lewis fell among &#145;gay, idle young fellows&#146;  (ibid.) before he entered the army as a matross based at Woolwich. Rather than rescue him from his dissipation, military life heightened Lewis's sense of social ambition and love of sartorial display, resulting in substantial indebtedness to a tailor which &#145;obliged him to decamp and quit this genteel Support&#146;  (ibid.). Lewis next joined the navy, in which he became a lieutenant and saw action at the reduction of Cherbourg, the battle of St Cast (1758), and the capture of Guadeloupe (1759). Though commended for his bravery, in the West Indies he also gained a reputation for deception and robbery, having tricked fellow sailors out of money, for which he was forced to desert his ship.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Lewis took up as a highwayman, his first recorded crime being the robbery from a carriage travelling between Newington and Vauxhall, Surrey, in 1761. During the following year he was tried four times, and on each occasion acquitted, once at the county assizes and three times at the Old Bailey. On the evening of 12 March 1762 Lewis performed what proved to be his final assault when he attempted to rob, and then shot at, Joseph Brown, a farmer from Willesden, Middlesex. Lewis was subsequently apprehended by a witness and held captive by the more powerful Brown until, after protesting his gentlemanly status, he was released. Lewis then prepared to fire on Brown for a second time before he was once more overpowered and detained by a constable. Tried at the Old Bailey, Lewis was on this occasion found guilty of robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to death.<br>
<br>In the final days before his execution (4 May 1763) Lewis scandalized the Newgate authorities with his blasphemy and high living (funded by his father, whom he tricked out of money during a visit). Once more he assumed the character and habits of a young gentleman for which he was honoured with the title of Captain in a reference to a former fictional inmate of the gaol, the swaggering highwayman Captain Macheath from John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> (1728). &#145;His Behaviour was such, as shocked every one who were Witnessed of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 4.273). To the young James Boswell, however, Lewis's conduct proved less clear-cut. On 3 May Boswell, denied a sight of John Wilkes at the Tower of London, had decided to visit the prisoners at Newgate where he met Lewis, to whom the impressionable young Scot was drawn by a display of gentlemanly bravado and fine dressing:<blockquote>Paul &hellip; was a genteel, spirited young fellow. He was just a Macheath &hellip; dressed in a white coat and blue silk vest and silver, with his hair neatly queued and a silver-laced hat, smartly cocked. Poor fellow! I really took a great concern for him, and wished to relieve him. (<span class="italic">Boswell's London Journal</span>, 251&#150;2)</blockquote>Lewis, together with the forger John Rice and the house burglar Hannah Dagoe, were led to Tyburn to be hanged on the following day. Despite his earlier contempt for the notion of redemption, Lewis now addressed the crowd from the scaffold, warning others not to follow his example and lamenting his untimely death at &#145;not twenty-three&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 4.271). One spectator who took Lewis's conduct to heart was Boswell, then attending the first of what became frequent visits to spectate at the gallows. As he wrote in his journal for 4 May, he had long been fascinated with the idea of Tyburn and the opportunity to witness the death of so beguiling an individual as Lewis proved irresistible. Historians now see Boswell's somewhat macabre interest as one example of a wider late eighteenth-century culture of sympathy or sensibility which prompted spectators to test their capacity for emotional sensitivity when faced with the plight of the condemned prisoner.<br>
<br>Deeply moved by what he saw at Tyburn, Boswell's desire to be thought a man of feeling instead plunged him into an intense period of melancholy and nightmares which continued to plague him, on and off, throughout his life. On the one hand Lewis's impact demonstrates the ease with which fashionable manners could degenerate to a debilitating pathology in the mind of hypochondriacs like Boswell. Equally, that it was the fate of a gentlemanly and gallant highwayman that proved so moving highlights the inherent snobbery of eighteenth-century sentimental culture; significantly Boswell felt no need to comment on, nor experienced lingering horrors for, Lewis's fellow victims, the sober John Rice and the plebeian Hannah Dagoe.<br>
