<span class="headword">Heywood, Sir  Benjamin</span>, first baronet  (1793&#150;1865), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born at St Ann's Square, Manchester, on 12 December 1793, the eldest son of Nathaniel Heywood (1759&#150;1815), a banker, and his wife, Ann, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21921/', "Thomas Percival")</script> MD FRS. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13191/', "Thomas Heywood (1797&#150;1866)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56315/', "James Heywood (1810&#150;1897)")</script> were his younger brothers. After attending Glasgow University (1809&#150;11) he entered his father's bank. He was admitted a partner in 1814 and eventually became head of the firm and, from 1828, its sole proprietor. In 1816 he married Sophia Ann (<i>d</i>. 1852), the daughter of Thomas Robinson of The Woodlands, Manchester; they had numerous children, of whom several died young. A man of considerable piety, Heywood took a keen interest in the welfare and education of the working classes. He was one of the founders of the Manchester mechanics' institution and served as president from its inception in 1825 until 1840; on his retirement from this office, the various addresses which he had delivered were published (1843).<br>
<br>Heywood was elected MP for Lancashire in 1831 as a whig, to support the government measure for reform, but he felt that his health was suffering, and when parliament dissolved after passing the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> in 1832 he retired from this aspect of public life. He was, however, active in the Manchester Statistical Society, and conducted an inquiry into the condition of the working classes in Manchester which was made public in 1834. He was created a baronet on the occasion of Queen Victoria's coronation in 1838, and in 1843 he was elected FRS. In 1860 Heywood left the bank and passed the business to four of his sons. After several years in declining health he died at his home, Claremont, near Manchester, on 11 August 1865, and was buried, alongside his wife and deceased children, at St John's Church, Pendlebury, Manchester. His eldest son, Thomas Percival Heywood, succeeded as second baronet.<br>
