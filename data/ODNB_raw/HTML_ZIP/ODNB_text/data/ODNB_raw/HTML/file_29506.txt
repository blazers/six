<span class="headword">Williams,  George James <span class="st"> [Gilly]</span></span>  (1719&#150;1805), <span class="occ">wit and letter writer</span>, was born at Denton, Lincolnshire, the youngest of the four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29564/', "William Peere Williams (1664/5&#150;1736)")</script>, law reporter, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1724), the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14278/', "Sir George Hutchins")</script>, a king's sergeant and commissioner of the great seal. He was educated at Westminster School from June 1727, and was elected king's scholar in 1733. He was elected from Westminster to Trinity College, Cambridge, but chose instead to go to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 13 June 1737, aged seventeen. He never took a degree. On 13 June 1751, at Northolt, Middlesex, he married Diana Bertie, formerly Poltney (<i>bap</i>. 1708, <i>d</i>. 1754), elder of the two known daughters of Peregrine Bertie (<i>c</i>.1663&#150;1711), politician, and his mistress Elizabeth Allen (<i>d</i>. 1738), known as Mrs Poltney during her relationship with Bertie. Elizabeth Allen subsequently married William, fifth earl of Coventry. Williams and his wife had no children. Williams embarked on a career holding administrative office, becoming inspector-general of inland excise duties in 1751, and deputy cofferer of the king's household in 1754. However, by the time of his marriage Williams appears already to have established himself as a fixture in the so-called &#145;out-of-town party&#146;, consisting of, among others, the wit and politician George Selwyn, the poet and politician Richard (Dick), second Baron Edgcumbe, and the author Horace Walpole, who met regularly at Walpole's residence at Strawberry Hill, Twickenham.<br>
<br>In this society Williams, known to his friends as Gilly Williams, enjoyed a reputation as a wit, though he was personally suspicious of his claim to, or the merit of, such a title. Writing to Selwyn in November 1751, for example, Williams mentioned that Lord Robert Bertie (his wife's cousin) was to propose him for White's Club, but asked that no member &#145;shake his head at me for a wit, for God knows he may as well reject me for being a giant&#146;  (Parnell Kerr, 73). Three years later Williams was duly elected to White's, where during the parliamentary sessions he met members of his circle for &#145;wit and whist&#146; before retiring to Selwyn's Thursday club at the Star and Garter tavern in Pall Mall during recess. From the early 1750s until 1770 Williams was one of Selwyn's most regular correspondents, his writing displaying a sharpness and humour if not the fineness of Walpole's letters. It was at Selwyn's house at Matson, near Gloucester, that Williams's wife Diana died on 16 September 1754. The friendship was commemorated by Sir Joshua Reynolds in a rare conversation piece depicting Williams (seated to the right of the group in a mauve coat) with Selwyn and Lord Edgcumbe. Painted between 1759 and 1761, the portrait was presented to Horace Walpole, who thought it &#145;charming &hellip; being one of the best things he has executed&#146;  (30 Dec 1761, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.41). From 1770 Williams appears to have played a less active role in Selwyn's circle, though later correspondence reveals him to have remained a lingering presence at the card and dinner table. Perhaps he chose now to focus on the third component of his motto derived from that of Sir William Temple: <i>Old wood to burn, old friends to converse with, and old books to read</i>. Alternatively, perhaps his office-holding had become more onerous after the appointment of his niece's husband Frederick North, Lord North, as first lord of the Treasury in 1770. In 1772 he was appointed joint receiver of revenue in Virginia, and in 1774 receiver-general of the excise, a post he still held at his death. Following North's resignation in March 1782 he was described by Walpole as one of &#145;Lord North's confidants&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 29.206) and his support for the former minister as &#145;setting up with the corpse&#146; by Selwyn  (ibid.). He may have effectively retired from the excise by 1792, as in that year a deputy is listed for the first time. Williams died at his house in Cleveland Court, St James's, Westminster, on 28 November 1805. In his will he directed that his body be buried in the Williams family vault at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.<br>
