<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Farquhar,  John</span>  (1751&#150;1826), <span class="occ">merchant and entrepreneur</span>, the son of John Farquhar, was born at Bilbo, in the parish of Crimond, Aberdeenshire. Born of humble parents, at the age of fifteen he was awarded a bursary to attend the Marischal College of Aberdeen. After four years of study, he was entitled to the award of MA, and he soon moved on to London. From there he secured the post of surgeon's mate on an East Indiaman bound for China, but he jumped ship and became surgeon on a vessel making for Calcutta instead. On arrival in Bengal, he became a writer employed in a merchant's office near Barrackpore and he began to dabble in his own private commercial activity. In his spare time he amused himself with chemical experiments, and this led to the eventual acquisition of a large personal fortune. The gunpowder manufactured at Pultah in the interior having been found unsatisfactory, Farquhar was selected by Lord Cornwallis, governor-general of Bengal, to conduct researches and render his assistance. This proved so valuable that he was made superintendent of the factory, and ultimately became sole contractor to the government. His energy and ability soon acquired for him both wealth and influence, and he won the special confidence and favour of Warren Hastings.<br>
<br>In 1814 Farquhar returned to England, in possession of about &pound;500,000 which was invested in the government fund set up to cover the national debt. Farquhar took up residence in Upper Baker Street, Portman Square. He was a bachelor whose sole attendant was an old woman, and his house soon became conspicuous for its neglected appearance. He himself was often mistaken for a beggar in the street. An eccentric figure, Farquhar nevertheless retained a sharp sense of business acumen. He became a partner in the great agency house of Basset, Farquhar &amp; Co. in the City, and purchased a share in the Whitbread brewery. His wealth, as it accumulated, was invested in the government funds and was devoted partly to the purchase of estates. In 1822 he purchased Fonthill Abbey from William Beckford for &pound;330,000, and he occasionally lived there until the fall of the tower in December 1825, shortly after which he sold the estate. Though penurious in his personal habits he was fond of attending sales, and was a keen bidder for any object that struck his fancy. Notwithstanding his idiosyncrasies, contemporaries commented on his personal warmth, generosity, and devotion to charitable works.<br>
<br>Besides having a special knowledge of chemistry Farquhar was an accomplished classical scholar, and also excelled in mathematics and mechanics. His religious beliefs were modified by his strong admiration of the moral system of the Brahmans. He wished to expend &pound;100,000 for the foundation of a college in Aberdeen, with a reservation in regard to religion, but on account of a difficulty about parliamentary sanction the scheme was not carried out. He died suddenly of &#145;apoplexy&#146; at his home in New Road, Regent's Park, on 6 July 1826 and was buried on 13 July at St John's Wood Chapel. At the time of his death, his wealth amounted to well over a million pounds, and there was much public interest in the distribution of his estate. This interest was heightened by the disappearance of a will that Farquhar was believed to have made in Calcutta in 1814. The will was thought to have contained a large bequest to be used for educational purposes in Scotland, but when the prerogative court of chancery considered the case in 1829 Sir John Nicholls decreed that Farquhar had in fact died intestate. Accordingly the estate was divided between Farquhar's seven nephews and nieces, and the administration was on 20 December 1838 at under &pound;500,000.<br>
