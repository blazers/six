<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Firmin,  Thomas</span>  (1632&#150;1697), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born in Ipswich in June 1632. His father, Henry Firmin, a butcher, and his wife, Prudence, were both puritans and parishioners of the like-minded Samuel Ward, who, as town preacher, preached at St Mary-le-Tower three times weekly from 1605 to 1635, when he was silenced by Archbishop William Laud and Bishop Matthew Wren. In 1635 Henry Firmin appeared before the high commission court accused of erroneous beliefs and was interrogated by Laud. A posthumous vindication of his son was to note that Thomas Firmin &#145;looked on liberty of conscience to be the birth right of every Christian&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Charitable Samaritan</span>, 9), and the memory of his father's tribulations may well have been the root cause of such a conviction.<h2>
<a name="Earlybusinesscareer"></a>Early business career</h2>Firmin was an intelligent boy and was apprenticed to a London mercer. His noticeable speed and easy disposition in serving customers earned him the nickname Spirit, and both characteristics were precursors of the abilities in commerce and welfare he showed in later years. His honesty was proven when another apprentice who had accused Firmin of stealing &pound;5 later confessed his guilt. Firmin mastered shorthand and used it to transcribe sermons; from this activity he gained his knowledge and understanding of theological matters. With his master he regularly attended the services of John Goodwin, the Independent Arminian, then at St Stephen's, Coleman Street, and as a result lost the strict Calvinism of his early upbringing. A story that tells of Firmin interceding with Cromwell on behalf of John Biddle, &#145;the father of English Unitarians&#146;, during his apprenticeship seems apocryphal. Firmin certainly knew Biddle before the latter's banishment to the Scilly Isles in 1655, and looked after him in his later illness. Biddle was to have a great influence on Firmin, convincing him of the unscriptural nature of the doctrine of the Trinity, and of the need for investigation into the state of the poor as a necessary concomitant to almsgiving.<br>
<br>At some time during the later years of the Commonwealth Firmin set up his own business as girdler and mercer with an initial capital of &pound;100. He opened a shop at 3 King's Court in Lombard Street. During this period he also began to make the acquaintance of several key religious and lay figures. Well before 1660 Firmin was entertaining those who were to have a powerful influence on shaping the post-Restoration Church of England. Men such as Benjamin Whichcote, John Worthington, Christopher Fowler, and John Tillotson were regularly to be found at his table. His largess was helped considerably by his first marriage, to a citizen's daughter, in 1660, which brought with it a dowry of &pound;500.<h2>
<a name="Philanthropicprojects"></a>Philanthropic projects</h2>Firmin had been convinced by Biddle that in dealing with the poor remote almsgiving alone was insufficient. The poor also needed to be visited and the true nature and cause of their condition understood. These visits helped Firmin to see the problem of poverty in a more enlightened way. He realized, unlike many of his contemporaries, that many of the poor suffered their miserable condition not through idleness or choice but because of forces outside their control. He also became firmly convinced that providing work for the poor was a better way to deal with their plight than providing doles which left them dependent, despondent, and prone to begging. His consistent exertions on behalf of the poor were to earn him the epithet of &#145;almoner-general&#146; among his contemporaries.<br>
<br>Firmin's first wife, with whom he had a son and a daughter, died in 1662 while he was away on business in Cambridge. On 23 February 1664 he married Margaret (1641/2&#150;1719), daughter of Giles Dent of Newport, Essex. A year later Firmin and his family had to flee London in wake of the great plague. On his return he began his first major experiment in philanthropy. The plague had caused great disruption to trade, and Firmin sought to provide work in clothing manufacture for those affected by the consequent unemployment. It was the only one of his philanthropic ventures which did not make a loss, although, as he himself argued in his only known pamphlet, profitability was to be considered of secondary importance when compared with eradicating the evils of idleness and begging, and subsidized loss was to be preferred to alternatives which provided no return at all.<br>
<br>In the great fire of 1666 Firmin lost his Lombard Street premises to the flames, but he was able to operate out of temporary premises in Leadenhall Street until they were rebuilt. He seems to have suffered no long-term damage to his business, and the 1670s saw him expand his philanthropic ventures considerably. Having realized that poverty resulted in the deprivation of both food and warmth, about 1670 he began a project to stockpile coal and corn to be sold to the poor at a reasonable price in times of need. It is not clear how long this venture was maintained, nor what success, if any, it experienced. More is known about the other philanthropic activities which were to occupy him for the last three decades of his life.<br>
<br>The noted Bristol philanthropist Thomas Gouge was a frequent visitor to Firmin's house, and the two men worked together on a number of projects including financing the publication of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Welsh and arranging for the printing and distribution of 10,000 copies of a simple scripture catechism. With the example and encouragement of Gouge, Firmin developed several schemes aimed at providing work for the poor. In 1676 he started a workhouse in Little Britain to give employment in the linen trade. The employees were well treated, their wages complemented by doles of coal, and their children given a basic education. Firmin was however opposed to any curriculum aimed at bringing the liberal arts to his charges: the children of the poor, especially those who came to the workhouse, were to receive an education that was to be purely vocational and geared to fitting them for their station in life. Firmin was firmly convinced that home working was to be encouraged wherever possible, and his <span class="italic">Some Proposals for the Imploying of the Poor</span> (1678), based on his experience, is in part a refutation of those who questioned the wisdom and practicalities of such a proposal. The project in Little Britain was never a financial success, and Firmin seems to have lost over &pound;200 per annum during its period of operation. An attempt at woollen manufacture, a more profitable enterprise than linen manufacture, was abandoned because of a shortage of skills among his workforce. Attempts to widen these ventures through a London-wide Corporation of the Poor eventually failed, but a clear indication of Firmin's standing and recognized expertise is given in the fact that in 1696 the Board of Trade was keen to solicit his advice on various employment projects.<br>
<br>From the time of his visits to John Biddle and John Knowles (<i>fl</i>. 1646&#150;1668) during their periods of incarceration, Firmin had become very aware of the conditions prevailing in prisons and the unscrupulous and rapacious demands of warders. He was keen that the rights of prisoners should be upheld and on more than one occasion initiated prosecutions against gaolers for extortion. He also helped sponsor parliamentary bills for the relief of prisoners held because of minor debts.<br>
<br>Firmin was an original member of the Society for the Reformation of Manners. His biographer notes that he could not abide swearing or foul language and would &#145;fine&#146; those who uttered such words in his presence, using the money for his various ventures to alleviate the sufferings of the poor. His skills were recognized in his appointment as one of the governors of Christ's Hospital in 1675 and his election as a common councilman about the same time. Firmin was an indefatigable worker for Christ's Hospital, and in conjunction with his friend Sir Robert Clayton inaugurated several improvements in the fabric of the building, as well as providing some of the finance for these changes. His Sunday evenings were frequently spent in the company of the scholars of the foundation. Further recognition of Firmin's merits came with his appointment as a governor of St Thomas's Hospital in 1693. His business acumen and shrewdness also led to him being named several times as a collector of taxes.<br>
<br>Firmin seems to have been a whig in politics, and it was almost certainly this identification that cost him his governorship of Christ's Hospital in 1683, although he was reinstated in 1688. At the time of the exclusion crisis Firmin was well known for his opposition to the duke of York. He was held briefly on suspicion of having taken part in a plot to oust James II but was quickly released without charge. He greeted the accession of William and Mary with relief and enthusiasm.<br>
<br>If Firmin was happy to see charity begin at home he was certainly not content that it should end there. Throughout his life he was constantly engaged in collecting money for refugees fleeing from religious persecution. Interestingly, in the light of later events examined below, the first recipients of such charity were the Polish Socinians driven from their homeland in 1662. (Socinianism was a radical anti-trinitarian form of protestantism.) When their erstwhile persecutors, the Polish Calvinists, suffered the same fate at the hands of their Catholic countrymen in 1681, Firmin organized a collection for them too, despite their previous intolerance. In the same year the French Huguenot refugees were the object of his attentions. Firmin collected over &pound;4000 for their relief and attempted to set them up in the linen business in his native Ipswich. When Irish protestants fled in the wake of James II in 1688&#150;9, Firmin was one of the principal commissioners charged with raising funds for them. Over &pound;56,000 was raised, and eight of the protestant bishops wrote a joint letter of thanks. Firmin's firm belief in the liberty of conscience in matters religious is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that in 1695 he was prevented from raising similar funds for the relief of the nonjurors. According to Wallace, &#145;he was of the opinion, that, of all objects of charity, those who suffered for conscience sake had the strongest claim upon the sympathy of their Christian brethren&#146;  (Wallace, 1.176&#150;7). His views on toleration led John Locke, who stayed with Firmin on several occasions, to have his third letter on toleration sent to Firmin.<h2>
<a name="Religiousbeliefs"></a>Religious beliefs</h2>These radical views on religious liberty would have been enough for many of Firmin's contemporaries to label him a Socinian. The powerful influence exerted by John Biddle has been noted above, and according to Nye it was Biddle who convinced Firmin that God was as much a unity of person as of nature. The exact nature of his own anti-trinitarianism is, however, more difficult to concern. His heterodoxy in regard to the doctrine was well known, and he seems to have made little effort to disguise it. Queen Mary herself apparently urged Tillotson, a long-standing friend of Firmin and by then archbishop of Canterbury, to convert him to orthodoxy, and Tillotson's celebrated sermons on the Trinity, originally preached over the winter of 1679&#150;80, were republished to that end in 1693. Even one of Firmin's posthumous defenders freely admitted that &#145;he was not so orthodox, as I cou'd have wished he had been, in his opinion about the holy Trinity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Charitable Samaritan</span>, 15). Many during his lifetime and after have been content, with varying degrees of opprobium, to label Firmin a Socinian, while others have been more measured in their verdicts. Bishop Burnet commented that &#145;he was called a Socinian, but was really an Arian&#146;  (Wallace, 3.380). Firmin's posthumous biographer, Stephen Nye, was at pains to show that Firmin was opposed to crude tritheism and inopportune terms, which &#145;heathenizes all the common people&#146;  (Nye, <span class="italic">An Account of Mr Firmin's Religion</span>, 63). While this caveat may well reflect Nye's opinions more than Firmin's, the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> happily acceded to this verdict and judged him a Sabellian.<br>
<br>Whatever the exact nature of his own opinions, Firmin was instrumental in causing at least four anti-trinitarian tracts to be written, published, and disseminated and in financing these. His industry in this regard was not unknown, and he was attacked in 1692 for being &#145;the bold spreader of Socinian papers&#146;  (Milbourne, preface). The controversies surrounding the doctrine of the Trinity which exploded in the established church in the closing decade or so of the seventeenth century were detonated by the first of these tracts. <span class="italic">A Brief History of the Unitarians, also called Socinians</span>, written anonymously by Stephen Nye, was published first in 1687 and again in 1690. <span class="italic">Brief Notes on the Creed of St. Athanasius</span>, possibly by Nye, appeared in 1689, the year in which the use of this creed was to be debated in convocation. In 1693 Nye's <span class="italic">Considerations on the Explications of the Doctrine of the Trinity</span> was a response to Tillotson's lectures noted above. A more eirenic work, <span class="italic">The Agreement of the Unitarians with the Catholick Church</span>, also by Nye, was published in 1697.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Firmin died in London of typhoid fever on 20 December 1697, attended in his last hours by his friend Edward Fowler, by then bishop of Gloucester. Firmin died worth about &pound;3000 but had given away that amount many times over during all the years of his philanthropy. He was buried, as he requested in his will, in the cloisters of his beloved Christ's Hospital. But even in death his role in the controversies surrounding the doctrine of the Trinity were a matter of acrimonious exchange. Within weeks of his demise his memory was maligned and his financial rectitude questioned in a poisonous sermon preached by Luke Milbourne. Samuel Pepys noted the disgust felt in society by such low behaviour, especially in regard to one held in high esteem for his charitable works. Three works defending Firmin appeared in 1698, <span class="italic">The Life of Mr Thomas Firmin</span>, <span class="italic">The Charitable Samaritan</span>, and <span class="italic">An Account of Mr Firmin's Religion</span>. Only the last made much effort to defend Firmin against the charge of unorthodoxy, while the other two laid stress on his good works as a sign of his sincere Christian faith despite his views on the Trinity. This was also the line taken by Fowler, who composed Firmin's epitaph. The original memorial however had to be quickly removed so that a phrase which seem to suggest such a justification could be altered. Firmin's biographer sums up his life in a nutshell: &#145;a person of middle extraction and slender beginnings, who raised himself to the honour of a very great number of illustrious friendships &hellip; like our Saviour he went around doing good&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life of Mr Thomas Firmin</span>, 77&#150;8).<br>
<br>A portrait of Firmin given to Christ's Hospital by John Cary was unfortunately destroyed in the Second World War, but the frontispiece to <span class="italic">The Life of Mr Thomas Firmin</span> may well be a likeness. His only known publication, <span class="italic">Some Proposals for the Imploying of the Poor</span>, was revised and expanded in 1681. His amended memorial may still be seen in Newgate Street.<br>
<br>All Firmin's children by both marriages died in infancy except for his son <a name="cosubject_46723"></a><span class="headword">Giles Firmin</span>  (1665&#150;1694), born on 22 May 1665. He married Rachel (<i>d</i>. 1724), daughter of Perient Trott, and became a successful <span class="occ">merchant</span>, but he too predeceased his father, dying at Porto on 22 January 1694, and was buried at Newport on 13 April.<br>
