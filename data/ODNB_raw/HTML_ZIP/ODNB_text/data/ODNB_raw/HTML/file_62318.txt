<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gower <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Fahie]</span>,  Pauline Mary de Peauly</span>  (1910&#150;1947), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born on 22 July 1910 at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, the younger of two daughters of Sir Robert Vaughan Gower (1880&#150;1953), solicitor and Conservative MP, and his first wife, Dorothy Susie Elenor (1882&#150;1936), the only daughter of Herbert McClellan Wills JP. As her father had considerable financial resources the family lived comfortably in a large house close to Tunbridge Wells. Pauline and her sister were educated at the Sacred Heart Convent in Tunbridge Wells, initially as day students and then later as boarders, although their home, Sandown Court, Pembury, was only 3 miles away. The family was not Roman Catholic but the school's principal, Mother Ashton Case, was a cousin of Pauline's mother, which, along with the school's excellent reputation, may have influenced the parents' choice. Pauline fitted into school life easily and well. She was talented and able, which, combined with her sunny personality, made her popular with both staff and her fellow students. By the time she was in her mid-teens she had developed an abiding affection for both the institution and the religion. On 16 July 1926, just before her sixteenth birthday, she was received into the Catholic church.<br>
<br>After leaving school at eighteen Pauline Gower went through a London season as a d&eacute;butante and was presented at court. Unsure what to do with her life, she played with ideas of furthering her interests in such things as music, Greek mythology, photography, horse riding, and politics, but she soon settled on the notion of becoming a pilot. Her interest in aviation was kindled when she went for a joyride during her last year at school. When she was nineteen her decision had been made: she would do all she could to make a career in aviation and, in the face of her father's vehement disapproval, she proceeded to arrange flying lessons. Her parents refused all financial help so she raised the necessary money by giving violin lessons. After only seven hours of instruction she made her first solo flight and by 4 August 1930, after fifteen hours and fifteen minutes flying time, was granted an A (private pilot's) licence. She was the first woman to obtain a flying certificate from Phillips and Powis School of Aviation and the first woman to fly solo after such a short period of instruction. So as to fulfil her ambition of earning a living from flying she enrolled at the London aeroplane club, Stag Lane, in order to train for a B (commercial) licence. It was here that she became friends with Amy Johnson, recently returned from a record-breaking solo trip to Australia, and met Dorothy Spicer, who was to become her partner in various aviation ventures. On 13 July, having successfully completed the night-flying test, she was awarded a B licence, becoming the third woman in the world to do so.<br>
<br>While training, Pauline Gower and Dorothy Spicer had decided to establish a joyriding business, with Pauline as the pilot and Dorothy as the engineer. This they did, initially with a hired Gipsy Moth and later with a secondhand Simmonds Spartan two-seater, a twenty-first birthday present given to Pauline by her father, who had by this time become supportive of her activities. With Wallingford, Berkshire, as their headquarters they flew to various parts of the country to provide joyrides and air-taxi trips. Initially they took a light-hearted approach to flying, but their attitude changed when one day Pauline discovered that she had carelessly taken off without adequately bolting the aircraft's folding wings in position. They both settled down and studied their respective areas with great diligence and considerable aptitude. Pauline eventually obtained every flying certificate possible and Dorothy every one in aeronautical engineering.<br>
<br>In 1932 the pair joined the Crimson Fleet air circus of Modern Airways Ltd and, later, British Hospitals Air Pageant. At the time Britain had gone &#145;air mad&#146; and several air circuses were operating around the country, which, much like traditional circuses, would travel from town to town. After the rigours of air-circus life the partners decided to establish Air Trips Ltd, an aerial-taxi and joyriding business operating from the holiday town of Hunstanton, Norfolk. It was the first aviation company to be wholly owned and staffed by women. By 1936 they were touring again, this time with Tom Campbell Black's British Empire Air Display. Pauline was appointed the chief pilot and Dorothy the senior engineer.<br>
<br>While she was with the circus in Scotland, Pauline learned of her mother's sudden and tragic death. Feeling that she should support her father she gave up touring. Air Trips Ltd moved into its final phase when the partners established an aerial garage at an airfield on Hayling Island in Hampshire. They found the work dissatisfying and as both had many other irons in the fire they decided to end the business. Their final task was to write a book, <span class="italic">Women with Wings</span>, published in 1938. Amy Johnson wrote the foreword, Pauline the body of the text, and Dorothy the prologue and epilogue.<br>
<br>In the second half of 1938 Pauline's many and varied activities were recognized with a variety of honours and appointments, including her election as a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society and the conferment of the dignity of officer of the venerable order of St John of Jerusalem. She became sought after as a speaker and was asked to serve on various committees, among them the Gorrell committee, set up to look into the matter of air safety, upon which she was not only the youngest member but also the only woman. In 1939 she was appointed a commissioner of the Civil Air Guard.<br>
<br>War seemed inevitable and Britain was particularly vulnerable as the Royal Air Force was small with an insufficient number of pilots. So that RAF pilots could concentrate on combat duties, such tasks as ferrying new aircraft from the factories to the squadrons and returning with damaged ones were delegated to the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). On 1 December 1939 Pauline was appointed as an ATA second officer and given the job of forming a women's section. At the beginning there were only nine women pilots flying light trainers; as the war progressed more were appointed until the number of women serving in the auxiliary exceeded 150. The women pilots eventually flew all types of aircraft, from light trainers to four-engined bombers. The value of their contribution was finally recognized when Pauline obtained the same pay for her women pilots as the men received for doing the same work. Pauline herself achieved the rank of commandant, and in 1942 she was appointed MBE. Pauline Gower's leadership abilities, organizational skill, and contribution to aviation were further recognized when she was appointed a director of British Overseas Airways on 26 May 1943, thereby becoming the first woman to obtain such a position in any national airline. Her workload increased enormously as she was still responsible for the women's section of the ATA. However, she was able to find the time for a personal life: during Easter 1945 she became engaged to Wing Commander William Cusack Fahie (1918&#150;1972) and they were married on 2 June 1945 at the Brompton Oratory, London. Her life suddenly and unexpectedly ended on 2 March 1947, at her home, 2 The Vale, Chelsea, when she died of a heart attack, having just given birth to twin boys, Paul and Michael. She was buried on 7 March at the new cemetery, Tunbridge Wells.<br>
