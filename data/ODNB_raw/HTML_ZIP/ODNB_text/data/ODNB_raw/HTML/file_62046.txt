<span class="headword">Graefer,  John Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1802), <span class="occ">horticulturist and landscape gardener</span>, was born in Vienna but at an early age came to England, where he became a pupil of the gardener Philip Miller. He was subsequently employed as a gardener by the earl of Coventry, and then by James Vere at Kensington Gore. About 1776 he established a nursery at Mile End, London, in partnership with another gardener and a seedsman. According to W. Aiton, in the <span class="italic">Hortus Kewensis</span> of 1810, between 1783 and 1784 Graefer introduced in England, possibly with seeds provided by the Swedish botanist and medical doctor Carl Peter Thunberg (one of the few foreigners who had been allowed to visit Japan), the <i>Aucuba japonica</i>, the <i>Ophiopogon japonica</i>, the <i>Orontium japonica</i>, and the <i>Eucomis punctata</i>. He also reintroduced in England the <i>Eleagnus angustifolius orientalis</i>.<br>
<br>In 1786 Sir William Hamilton had persuaded the queen of Naples, Maria Carolina, to have an English garden laid out at the royal palace at Caserta. Graefer, whose name had been suggested by Sir Joseph Banks, thus entered the service of the queen, and moved to Naples with his three sons, John, Charles, and George. On his journey, while his ship was obliged to halt in the harbour of Ponza, Graefer had the opportunity to spend some time on the island, and drew up a detailed <span class="italic">Flora insulae Ponza</span>. In Caserta, Graefer laid out a charming (although rather small) English garden and stocked it with a large variety of plants. As Loudon says: &#145;Every exotic, which at that time could be furnished by the Hammersmith nursery, was planted &hellip;. Among these the Camellias, Banksias, Proteas, Magnolias, Pines, etc.&#146;  (Loudon, 19). At the same time Graefer, according to Loudon, also laid out several other gardens in Naples, including one for the duca di San Gallo. In Caserta, however, he met with many unforeseen difficulties; the Neapolitans did not seem to appreciate his work and his subordinates cheated him shamelessly. In 1788 the queen became tired of the project and the English garden was taken over by the king, Ferdinando IV. As a result Graefer had to accept a drastic cut in salary and was obliged to work under the supervision of the architect Carlo Vanvitelli.<br>
<br>In 1789 Graefer published <span class="italic">A descriptive catalogue of upwards of eleven hundred species and variations herbaceous and perennial plants</span>, which was reprinted at least four times (4th edn, 1804). In its foreword the &#145;Editor&#146; informed the reader, among other things, that &#145;the Author of the following Catalogue is publicly celebrated, in the Annals of the Admiralty, for his <span class="italic">Invention of Prepared Vegetables</span>&#146;. This consisted of the preparation of dried vegetables, which permitted ships' provisions of greens, such as broccoli, to be preserved for over a year. According to a 1793 work by N. Hadrawa, Graefer also drew up a <span class="italic">Flora dell'isola di Capri</span> and sent it for publication to a natural history society in Berlin. The book apparently was not published and the manuscript was lost (Norman Douglas made an extensive, but unsuccessful, search for it in 1930).<br>
<br>In 1791 Graefer (who by then must have been a widower), married Elizabeth Dodsworth, a young woman from Chester. In 1792 she gave birth to a son, Ferdinando, who died shortly afterwards; a second child, Maria Carolina, was born in 1794. In December 1798, when the French invasion became imminent, the royal family and the Neapolitan court escaped to Sicily. Graefer was taken along with them and became employed by Lord Nelson as steward of his estate, Bronte. Unfortunately Graefer's competence as an administrator did not match his skill as a gardener. After complaining about the squandering and prodigality of his steward (&#145;Graefer thought that I approved giving to the poor&#146;), Nelson, in 1802, felt somehow relieved by Graefer's death: &#145;I have lost Graeffer [<i>sic</i>], my Governor of Bronte: he died August 7. It embarrasses me a little, but I endeavour to make the best of things, and it may possibly turn out to my pecuniary advantage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters</span>, 30).<br>
