<span class="headword">Collins,  William</span>  (1721&#150;1793), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, served as a hand in the workshops of Henry and John Cheere until he was about thirty-eight years old. It is likely that he produced charming panels on light-hearted arcadian subjects for chimney-pieces. J. T. Smith recalled that he gained a reputation for carving &#145;pastoral scenes that were understood by the most common observer&#146;  (Gunnis, 111). About 1759&#150;60 he opted to become independent of his main employer, Henry Cheere, who had begun to reduce the productivity of his Westminster workshops. Setting up a business in Channel Row, close to his master's former shop in St Margaret's Lane, Collins was immediately successful. By 1760 he had received a major commission to carve a series of relief medallions, allegories of Liberty, Britannia, Commerce, and Agriculture, for the adornment of Harewood House in Yorkshire. A year later he was working on medallions on the fa&ccedil;ade of Kedleston House, Derbyshire.<br>
<br>With a number of other sculptors Collins was associated with the St Martin's Lane Academy and was a subscriber to James Paine's <span class="italic">Plans, Elevations and Sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Houses</span> (1767&#150;83). In this book Collins was fulsomely praised as &#145;the ingenious Mr William Collins&#146;  (1.14). Paine singled out for particular commendation the &#145;very fine alto relievo&#146; carving on the pediment of Sandbeck Park, west Yorkshire (<i>c</i>.1763&#150;1768), the country seat of the earl of Scarbrough  (ibid.). It was at one of the architectural schemes where Paine was employed, the extension of Merly House, Dorset, where Collins executed his masterpiece, an ambitious cycle of stucco reliefs on themes including the history of the ancient religions of the world. This adorned the library, commissioned by Ralph Willett and built and decorated in the mid-1760s, but subsequently destroyed. An indication of the excellent design and workmanship of Collins's stucco panels is evident in a set of privately printed engravings commissioned by Willett. These include an image of an allegory of <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Britannia</span> that contains a self-portrait of Collins.<br>
<br>Collins was among the artists at the St Martin's Lane Academy who supported the scheme to set up the Incorporated Society of Artists of Great Britain. Together with Paine he devoted considerable energy to the establishment of the society, and he became one of its first directors. As a means to further his career, at the society's annual exhibitions between 1760 and 1768 he showed works of relief carving and modelling in a range of materials, including freestone, marble, and stucco. His first exhibits, such as <span class="italic">A Clown and Country Girl</span> recorded in the catalogue of 1761, were of his early pastoral type. He abandoned the cheerful rocaille style of these reliefs when commissions demanded more gravitas. An example of his more sober style may be seen at Bath Abbey in the monument to Jacob Bousanquet (<i>d</i>. 1767), which includes a signed relief of <span class="italic">The Good Samaritan</span>. His fine plaster relief of <span class="italic">The Resurrection</span> (completed before 1764) formerly above the altar of Magdalene College chapel, Cambridge, and now in the college library, similarly reveals a greater profundity of theme. Here, as in the altarpiece of St Mary's Church, Warwick, he invested the rocaille Gothic design of the architect, Timothy Lightoler, with a dignified solemnity. Collins also adapted himself to work in the restrained classical style that became fashionable in Britain during the early 1760s. His mastery in this milieu recommended him to Robert Adam, who employed him in 1767 to make chimney-pieces at Nostell Priory, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Like that of the Society of Artists, however, Collins's reputation did not long survive the foundation of the Royal Academy in 1768. He seems to have received no further large commissions after 1770 (when he was forty-nine), and the last twenty-three years of his life remain obscure. Collins died on 31 May 1793 at his home in Tothill Fields in the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster, where he had made his will on 23 May that year, and was buried in the old cemetery in King's Road, Chelsea. He left his freehold house to his only daughter, Elizabeth, and small sums of money to his four nieces, the daughters of his brother John.<br>
