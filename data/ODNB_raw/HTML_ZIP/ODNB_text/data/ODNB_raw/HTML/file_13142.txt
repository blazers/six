<span class="headword">Heveningham,  William</span>  (1604&#150;1678), <span class="occ">regicide</span>, was the eldest son of Sir John Heveningham (1578&#150;1633) of Ketteringham, Norfolk, and his second wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter of Christopher Paston of Paston, Norfolk. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1621. During the 1620s his father was a justice of the peace for Norfolk; Heveningham was a captain in the Norfolk militia and in the 1630s served as a deputy lieutenant, justice of the peace, and sheriff (1633&#150;4). He inherited at least fifteen manors on his father's death. On 23 November 1629 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1648), daughter of Sir Henry Wallop, an extremely wealthy resident of Hampshire and Wiltshire, and MP in numerous parliaments. Following Catherine's death Heveningham married in 1650 Mary (<i>d</i>. 1696), daughter of John Carey, fifth Baron Hunsdon and second earl of Dover; they had one son, Sir William Heveningham (<i>d</i>. 1674), who married Barbara, daughter of George Villiers, third Viscount Graham, and a daughter, Abigail, who married John Newton.<br>
<br>Heveningham, along with his father, refused to pay the forced loan of 1627 but, unlike his father, avoided imprisonment. Later he showed more discretion when in 1637 he admitted royal agents on his lands to obtain saltpetre, and when he paid the ship money assessment for 1640. In the elections for the Long Parliament he backed a moderate candidate, John Potts, for one of the county seats against Sir John Holland. Thanks to his father-in-law's influence, Heveningham himself was elected MP for Stockbridge, Hampshire, in the Short Parliament (1640) and again in the Long Parliament (1640), but rarely attended sessions. After the civil war began he served on the county committees for Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. With Sir Edmund Moundeford, MP for Norfolk, Heveningham supervised seven Norfolk hundreds on behalf of parliament in 1642. He advanced &pound;250 for the support of the parliamentarian garrison at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>In the 1640s Heveningham may have leant towards a presbyterian religious position and was an elder in a church of the Dunwich classis. Politically, however, he was an &#145;independent&#146;, favouring the claims and programme of the New Model Army in 1648. As an army sympathizer, he survived Pride's Purge (December 1648) and, with his brother-in-law, Robert Wallop, was named a judge for Charles I's treason trial. He attended thirteen sessions and, like Wallop, refused to sign the royal death warrant, though he later swore approval of the king's trial and execution [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. An anxiety to curb military rule appears to have prompted his greater involvement in politics at Westminster in 1649. He was elected to the first two councils of state under the Commonwealth in 1649 and 1650, though he expressed doubts about the engagement, a 1650 loyalty oath required of officeholders and clergy. He was named vice-admiral of Suffolk in 1651.<br>
<br>A heavy speculator in buying army debentures, Heveningham also bought several confiscated episcopal properties (the manors of Dalston, Rose Castle, and Linstock in the diocese of Carlisle), and purchased or leased various confiscated royalist properties, including Stainton Manor, Norfolk (1653), and the duke of Hamilton's Chelsea mansion. However, some of these purchases of royalist lands did not benefit him personally since they were bought on behalf of Norfolk's county committee to cover debts. He maintained a London residence at St Martin-in-the-Fields during the 1650s and became quite wealthy, probably realizing an annual income of at least &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Heveningham was perhaps the first regicide to surrender to the crown at the restoration of Charles II in June 1660, was tried in October as a regicide at the Old Bailey, and sentenced to death. His four petitions for mercy during 1660&#150;62, supported by his wife's family connections, claimed that despite serving as a judge he had opposed the execution of Charles I. Admitting that he deserved death, Heveningham's petitions also noted his appeals before the committee for compounding on behalf of his royalist brother, Sir Arthur Heveningham, in 1656 during the interregnum. Heveningham also claimed to have contributed &pound;500 to support Sir George Booth's royalist rising in 1659. Though Heveningham was spared execution, his wife's appeals that he be removed to her house in Suffolk failed and he remained a prisoner at Windsor Castle until his death there on 21 February 1678. His property, however, though initially confiscated, was eventually held in trust for his wife. He was buried at Ketteringham church on 25 February 1678.<br>
