<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  Vere Brabazon</span>, ninth earl of Bessborough in the peerage of Ireland and first earl of Bessborough in the peerage of the United Kingdom  (1880&#150;1956), <span class="occ">governor-general of Canada</span>, was born in London on 27 October 1880, the eldest son of Edward Ponsonby, eighth earl of Bessborough (1851&#150;1920), and his wife, Blanche Vere (<i>d</i>. 1919), daughter of Sir Josiah John Guest and his wife, Lady Charlotte Guest (later Schreiber). He went to Harrow School in the family tradition, then in 1898 to Trinity College, Cambridge, and after taking his degree in 1901 was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1903. Bessborough, co. Kilkenny, still remained the family home; there his father, who succeeded to the title in 1906, established a pack of hounds to hunt the neighbouring country, and Viscount Duncannon, as he then became, carried the horn.<br>
<br>Duncannon held a commission in the Buckinghamshire hussars and in 1906 stood for parliament unsuccessfully at Carmarthen as a Unionist. During these years, he might well have been spoilt in the role of an eligible and good-looking <i>parti</i>, but he was level-headed and industrious: after failing for parliament, he put in three useful years (1907&#150;10) representing Marylebone East on the London county council. In January 1910 he was returned to parliament for Cheltenham, but he lost his seat in the election of December. On 25 June 1912 he made the happiest of marriages with Roberte (<i>d</i>. 1979), only daughter of Baron de Neuflize, banker, of Paris, and in June of the next year, at a by-election, he was returned unopposed to parliament for Dover.<br>
<br>In the First World War Duncannon served in Gallipoli as GSO3 and afterwards held a staff post in France under his close friend Sir Henry Wilson. He was appointed CMG in 1919. He held his Dover seat at the general election of 1918, but relinquished it on his father's death in December 1920, when he succeeded as ninth earl of Bessborough.<br>
<br>After the war Bessborough went into the City and became chairman of the S&atilde;o Paulo Railway, deputy chairman of De Beers, and chairman of the Margarine Union until its merger in 1929 into Unilever, of which he became a joint chairman with D'Arcy Cooper.<br>
<br>In 1923 the family home in Ireland was burnt down in the political troubles there, but prudence had earlier dictated that pictures and other treasures should gradually be removed to England, and thus a number of them were saved. Bessborough spent a year or so looking round for another home and settled on Stansted Park, Rowland's Castle, on the Hampshire border of Sussex. A fine Queen Anne replica in a wide and classic setting, it possessed a 400-year-old chapel, with literary and historic associations, which he restored. Inheriting also the family flair for acting, he built a theatre, and soon enough performances of a high order were annually given before the neighbourhood. He encouraged cricket and maintained an excellent shoot.<br>
<br>Before all these matters were completed, Bessborough accepted in 1931 the post of governor-general of Canada. The appointment caused surprise in some quarters, not least in the dominion itself, where he was virtually unknown, but he could offer as qualifications his service on the London county council and in parliament, his business experience, an innate dignity, proven thoroughness, and industry. In his wife, a French protestant, he had a specially attractive consort, while his own command of French commended him also to the important French-Canadian community. He was sworn of the privy council and advanced to GCMG in 1931 and remained in Canada until 1935.<br>
<br>During his time there Bessborough was fortunate in not being called on to deal with constitutional problems of the gravity which had faced his predecessors. Throughout his term he proved a valuable cultural influence all over Canada, encouraging the arts generally and drama in particular; he promoted a revival of the National Drama Festival, which became an annual event. His monthly &#145;duty&#146; letters to the sovereign were well written, full, and lucid, and received the king's careful attention, and he conducted the office with great dignity. He did however have to adapt himself to the manners and customs of a new world with which he was unfamiliar. A habitual shyness, compounded by a quickness of temper, lent a certain reserve to his governor-generalship in its early days, and his insistence upon the detail of ceremonial etiquette contrasted unfavourably with the more relaxed regimes of his immediate predecessors. On one occasion in 1934 he rebuked the mayor of Toronto after arriving in the city for a public function and finding no official welcoming party there to greet him. Bessborough was discomfited by the outspoken press criticism that this incident attracted, and he afterwards made greater efforts to secure public acceptance. In June 1937 his Irish earldom was raised to an earldom of the United Kingdom in recognition of his services as governor-general.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Bessborough resumed many of his City interests and in 1936 became president of the Council of Foreign Bondholders and director (he was later chairman) of the Rio Tinto Company. Among his voluntary activities he was chairman of the board of governors of Cheltenham Ladies' College and president and chairman of the council of the British Hotels and Restaurants Association. He found time, too, to edit some of the family archives, and in <span class="italic">Lady Bessborough and her Family Circle</span> (1940) he presented with considerable literary skill the first authentic portrait of his great-grandmother Henrietta and dismissed some of the inaccuracies which malice and gossip had piled up round her and her daughter Caroline Lamb. He also edited (1950&#150;52) two volumes of diaries and papers of his grandmother Lady Charlotte Schreiber.<br>
<br>With the influx into Britain from France of refugees and the Resistance after 1939 Bessborough was an obvious choice to organize a department at the Foreign Office to co-ordinate all activities concerned with the welfare of the French in Great Britain. This he did very well (1940&#150;45), and he later became chairman of the Franco-British Society, serving this cause with constant interest until his death. Among other foreign decorations, Bessborough received the grand cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1950.<br>
<br>As he grew old, Bessborough's activities did not lessen but became more local. He was instrumental in the foundation of both the regency exhibitions in the Brighton Pavilion and the Regency Society. In the diocese of Chichester he was for years chairman of the board of finance and did a great deal of more general work for the church in Sussex and in the empire, to which his friend and bishop, G. K. A. Bell, paid unqualified tribute after his death. He was a conscientious landlord, knowing the family details of his tenants and neighbours and taking a deep interest in their affairs.<br>
<br>Bessborough and his wife suffered two separate and grievous tragedies in the accidental deaths of their two younger sons; that of his youngest in 1951 was a blow which must have shortened Bessborough's life. Yet he never surrendered to grief and continued his activities to the end. Nor did his own tragedies ever reduce his interest in the children of others or the sympathy he showed them. He died on 10 March 1956 at Stansted Park and was succeeded by his eldest and surviving son, Frederick Edward Neuflize (1913&#150;1993). His daughter, Moyra Blanche Madeleine (Lady Moyra Browne), was created DBE in 1977.<br>
