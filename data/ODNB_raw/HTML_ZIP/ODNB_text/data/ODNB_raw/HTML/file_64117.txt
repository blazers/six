<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Grantham, Sir  Alexander William George Herder</span>  (1899&#150;1978), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 15 March 1899 at Chippenham, The Avenue, Surbiton, the son of Frederick William Grantham, barrister, and his wife, Alexandra Ethelred Marie Sylvie Emilie von Herder. He was educated at Wellington College, the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and Pembroke College, Cambridge. He served in the First World War after being commissioned to the 18th hussars in 1917.<br>
<br>Grantham joined the colonial administrative service as a Hong Kong cadet in 1922, learned Cantonese, and served mainly in the colonial secretariat for about ten years. Ambitious and determined to rise to a colonial governorship, he requested a transfer in 1934 in order to advance his promotion prospect, accepting in the process a drop of about one-third in salary. In that year he attended the Imperial Defence College and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. He subsequently served as colonial secretary in Bermuda from 1935 to 1938 and in Jamaica from 1938 to 1941, and as chief secretary in Nigeria from 1941 to 1944, before being appointed governor of Fiji and high commissioner for the Western Pacific in 1945. He was knighted in that year. He assumed the governorship of Hong Kong on 25 July 1947 and retired on 31 December 1957, having been the colony's longest serving governor. Tall, handsome, charming, and intelligent, he was well liked by his subordinates and the non-official leaders of Hong Kong.<br>
<br>When the Second World War began Grantham was colonial secretary in Jamaica where his main contribution was to promote Anglo-American co-operation, as Jamaica was one of the colonies whose facilities Britain made available to the United States Navy in exchange for fifty old destroyers. He became more involved with the war after he became chief secretary in Nigeria, which was one of the four west African colonies that raised two divisions for operations in south-east Asia and an important source for groundnut oil, rubber, and tin. At the end of the war he was promoted to his first governorship: from 1945 to 1947 he presided over the rehabilitation of Fiji and played a positive role in establishing organs of international co-operation for the development and welfare of the south Pacific.<br>
<br>It was, however, during his final decade in Hong Kong that Grantham made his most decisive contribution as a colonial governor. When he assumed the governorship Hong Kong was already on its way to economic recovery but it faced the danger of the spilling over of the Chinese civil war (between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party) into the colony. The threat from China to Hong Kong's survival as a British colony appeared to have reached a near crisis point when the communists won control of the Chinese mainland and marched towards the Sino-British border in 1949. Grantham took the lead in working out a policy to defuse the threat from communist China. He rightly assessed that the communists would not invade Hong Kong provided the latter acknowledged its existence as a borrowed place on borrowed time, and made itself valuable to China.<br>
<br>At the same time Grantham took the lead to devise a policy of non-provocative firmness in dealing with Hong Kong's communist neighbour and in maintaining strict neutrality in the as yet unfinished Chinese civil war, which turned into a stalemate across the Taiwan Strait after the United States Navy started to patrol the straits when the Korean War broke out in 1950. By a combination of pragmatism, realism, and the ability to remain firm against any unreasonable demands, he played a crucial role in establishing a <i>modus operandi</i> between the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing, which allowed the latter to sidetrack domestic irredentist pressure. It was under his governorship that the Chinese government's demand, raised since 1942, for the return of the leased part of Hong Kong, was put aside. This continued for over three decades and allowed Hong Kong to transform itself from a colonial outpost into a cosmopolitan modern metropolis.<br>
<br>Grantham played an even more important, indeed a pivotal, role in the shelving of democratic reforms which were strongly advocated by his predecessor, Sir Mark Young. Although both men related the issue of democratization to the future of Hong Kong, Grantham, unlike Young, believed Hong Kong had no other future apart from being either a British colony or part of China's Guangdong (Kwangtung) province, given that 90 per cent of its territories were leased from China until 30 June 1997. Confident in his knowledge of the Chinese people and their politics, Grantham thought Young was misguided in attempting to turn Hong Kong's Chinese residents into loyal British subjects. He did not believe the Chinese of Hong Kong could become either loyal British subjects or good democrats. He was convinced that giving them the vote could only lead to their voting to end British colonial rule and to rejoin mother China, even though they actually preferred the stability and good order offered by the colonial government. Hence, he delayed the implementation of Young's reform plan for almost two years, and then substituted it with a set of more conservative proposals when the Chinese civil war was reaching its climax and distracting public attention in 1949. He remained sceptical about the wisdom of democratic changes in Hong Kong, and did not push hard for his proposals when various officials in the Colonial Office doubted the wisdom of his alternative. After Hong Kong started to suffer from its first recession, which threatened the livelihood of the overwhelming majority of its people and diverted their attention from the reform issue, Grantham adroitly manoeuvred to abandon democratization in 1952 on the ground that it would be &#145;inopportune&#146;, and skilfully sidetracked all subsequent demands to reopen the issue during the remainder of his governorship.<br>
<br>Grantham was married twice. His first marriage, to Maurine Samson (<i>d</i>. 1970) of San Francisco, took place in Hong Kong in 1925. After her death he married on 21 November 1972 Mrs Margaret Eileen Lumley (<i>b</i>. 1921/2), daughter of Charles S. Wright, a corn merchant. They had no children. He was appointed CMG in 1941, KCMG in 1945, and GCMG in 1951. In retirement Grantham lived in London, where he kept an interest in the welfare of Hong Kong and spoke and wrote occasionally to discourage others from &#145;rocking the boat&#146;. He also wrote an autobiography of his colonial service, <span class="italic">Via ports: from Hong Kong to Hong Kong</span>, which was published by the Hong Kong University Press in 1965. It was his second wife who nursed him through illness before he died on 4 October 1978.<br>
