<span class="headword">Stafford,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1663, <em>d.</em> 1703), <span class="occ">Jacobite pamphleteer</span>, was born at Marlwood Park, in the parish of Thornbury, Gloucestershire. Baptized there on 15 September 1663, he was the second son of John (<i>d</i>. 1705) and Catherine Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1710), and the grandson of the pamphleteer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26218/', "William Stafford (1593&#150;1684)")</script>. Educated at the free school at Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire, he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 15 February 1678. He spent six years at Magdalen Hall, graduating BA in 1681 and twice taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to Charles II and, therefore, to his heirs. From there he went to the Middle Temple in London, where he studied law for six years, though according to Wood he applied himself more to divinity. His 711-page book, <span class="italic">Of happiness, wherein it is fully and particularly manifested that the great happiness of this life consisteth in the fear of God and keeping his commandments</span>, appeared in 1689.<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688 Stafford devoted his attention to promoting the Jacobite cause. On 4 January 1690, &#145;out of burning zeal&#146;, he presented to parliament his <span class="italic">A Supplemental Tract of Government</span>  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.1124). In this he laid out Christ's laws of government and argued that the revolutionaries had departed &#145;from the established and fixed order of things he hath set up&#146;  (Stafford, <span class="italic">Supplemental Tract</span>, 1). England, therefore, stood under divine judgment. This action led to his imprisonment at Newgate for four weeks. On 25 March 1690 he sent a one-page broadside to the House of Commons entitled <span class="italic">His Case Humbley Offer'd to the Consideration of both Houses of Parliament</span>. This act led the Commons to order the sergeant-at-arms to arrest Stafford and search his quarters at the Temple. He remained in custody until the end of April, when he was discharged and sent to the care of his father in Gloucestershire. A second tract, published at the same time as the broadside, was entitled <span class="italic">A Clear Apology and Just Defence for Himself</span> (1690). There he claimed that he was using his study of the statutes and common law of England at the Middle Temple to defend the &#145;cause of the oppressed king&#146;. However, he not only claimed to speak from his legal training but also claimed that the spirit of God had raised him up to speak the truth of God and warn England that they were a rebellious people  (Stafford, <span class="italic">Clear Apology</span>, 11&#150;12).<br>
<br>On 3 November 1691 Stafford went to Kensington, the location of the queen's royal court, and distributed pamphlets. This led to his arrest and committal to the Bethlem Hospital. After the speaker of the House of Commons received a packet from him, he ordered the governor of Bedlam to prevent Stafford from obtaining pen, ink, or paper. Despite this order, Stafford continued to publish Jacobite tracts. He remained at the hospital until some time before his death on 2 July 1703 at Thornbury, Gloucestershire, where he was buried.<br>
