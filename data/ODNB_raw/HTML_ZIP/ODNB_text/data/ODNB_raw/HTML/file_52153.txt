<span class="headword">Penn <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Arthur; <em>other married name </em>Hicks]</span>,  Julian</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1592), <span class="occ">moneylender</span>, was apparently a daughter of William Arthur of &#145;Clapham&#146; (Clapton in Gordano), Somerset, but nothing is known of her early life. She married Robert Hicks, whose family lived near her, in the Bristol area, but the date and place of the marriage are unknown.<br>
<br>After their marriage, Robert Hicks went on to keep the White Bear mercer's shop, on the southern side of Cheapside, London; he was assessed for subsidy in St Pancras parish in 1541. Robert and Julian Hicks had six sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13215/', "Sir Michael Hickes")</script>, who became prominent as secretary to Lord Burghley and a personal and political friend to Burghley's youngest son, Robert Cecil. By his will, made on 21 November 1557, Robert Hicks, by then an ironmonger, left lands in Bristol and elsewhere in Gloucestershire to his wife, who was to pay his mother &pound;10 per annum; his property in St Katharine Coleman, London, was to go to his brother Richard, then to Julian.<br>
<br>Julian continued to manage her late husband's shop with the help of their sons, dealing with John and Gregory Isham, mercers; and she also became a prominent moneylender. Although her writing and spelling remained poor, even by the standards of the day, important clients usually treated her with respect. A letter written by William Cecil requests a loan of &pound;50, for &#145;a great occasion I have to use it&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 103, fol. 268): this was written after she had married Anthony Penn (probably in 1559) but perhaps was never sent.<br>
<br>By his will of 12 December 1570, Anthony Penn also bequeathed his goods to his wife. He was buried at St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, on 16 July 1572, and probate was granted on the following day. In August 1573 Julian's prospective third marriage, to a Mr Twitty, did not materialize.<br>
<br>In an undated letter to a Mr Hardwick, Julian explained her financial situation: she was &#145;daily driven to pawn my plate to supply ordinary charges&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 108, fol. 31<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>), but the debt remained unpaid. During 1576&#150;7 Mrs Penn listed her assets: &#145;I have in writings I think be good debts the sum of xviijC <i>li</i>[<i>bri</i>].&#146; As well, she had plate, jewels, tapestry, linen, furniture, and:<blockquote>my lease of the White Bear in Cheapside and my house that I now dwell in [on St Peter's Hill, in the parish of St Peter, Paul's Wharf: purchased in 1559] &hellip; I have lost since that time by &hellip; ill debts and furniture of the White Bear &hellip; vjC <i>li</i>[<i>bri</i>] &hellip; I [ac]knowledge myself from the first day of my birth I never deserved penny or piece of bread &hellip; God hath done it all, giving and taking. (BL, Lansdowne MS 108, fol. 30)</blockquote>In 1591 Edward de Vere, earl of Oxford, rented rooms in Mrs Penn's house at &pound;100 per annum, but flitted without paying. Thomas Churchyard, who had stood surety for him, wrote to Mrs Penn that &#145;for fear of [ar]resting I lie in the sanctuary&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 68, fol. 257). To Henry Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare, she wrote that &#145;But for the love I bear to my Lord Admiral [Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham] and my lady your wife [Effingham's daughter] I had ended my suit[,] for &hellip; the queen &hellip; hath promised me that I shall take no wrong at man's hand&#146;. Kildare replied, on 23 June 1591, &#145;I desire you now to bear with me but till my man return with money out of Ireland which will be within this fortnight at which time I will pay you with great thanks&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 68, fols. 207, 209).<br>
<br>Julian Penn died on 14 November 1592, and administration of her goods was granted to her son Michael on 22 December.<br>
