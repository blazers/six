<span class="headword">Tilt,  Edward John</span>  (1815&#150;1893), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Brighton on 30 January 1815, the son of John Tilt and his wife, Elizabeth. He received his medical education first at St George's Hospital, London, and then at Paris, where he graduated MD on 15 May 1839. He does not appear to have held any English qualification until he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1859. During his time in Paris, Tilt learned from R&eacute;camier about the use of the speculum as an aid to diagnosis and he later encouraged its use in Britain. He acted as travelling physician in the family of Count Shuvalov during 1848&#150;50, before settling in London about 1850, specializing in midwifery and the diseases of women. He was then appointed physician-accoucheur to the Farringdon General Dispensary and Lying-in Charity. He was one of the original fellows of the Obstetrical Society of London, which was formed in 1859, where, after filling various offices, he was elected president for 1874&#150;5. The title of cavaliere of the Crown of Italy was conferred upon him in 1875, and at the time of his death he was a corresponding fellow of the academies of medicine of Turin, Athens, and New York. He married, at the British embassy, Florence, on 22 May 1847, Dorothy Emma (1823/4&#150;1869), daughter of J. G. Sparrow of Gosfield Place, Essex; they had a daughter, Emaline (<i>b</i>. 1849), who later entered the Lanherne Carmelite convent in Cornwall. After his first wife's death he married, in 1877, Georgiana Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 1832/3), daughter of Thomas Hibbert, landowner, of Birtles Hall, Cheshire. Latterly he suffered from pulmonary disease, and lived mainly on the French riviera, where he formed a friendship with the physician James Henry Bennet (1816&#150;1891), who shared his interest in gynaecology and obstetrics. He died at 16 Robertson Terrace, Hastings, on 17 December 1893.<br>
<br>Tilt's works include <span class="italic">On Diseases of Menstruation and Ovarian Inflammation</span> (1850), <span class="italic">On the Elements of Health and Principles of Female Hygiene</span> (1852, German translation published in 1854), and <span class="italic">A Handbook of Uterine Therapeutics and of Diseases of Women</span> (1863), translated into German (1864) and into Flemish (1866).<br>
