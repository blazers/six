<span class="headword">Inman,  William Howard Wallace <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1929&#150;2005), <span class="occ">medical researcher and pharmaco-epidemiologist</span>, was born on 1 August 1929 at Braehead, Higher Drive, Cuddington, near Epsom, Surrey, the eldest of three sons of Wallace Mills Inman, industrial chemist, and later chairman of ICI's alkali division, and his wife, Maude Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Andrews. He was educated at Ampleforth College, where he excelled at sports and broke the school junior mile cross-country record. He went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, to read medicine, but at the age of twenty-one, just as he was about to start his clinical training, he contracted poliomyelitis, which left him in hospital for three years and in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Cambridge had no medical clinical school at that time, the usual arrangement being to move to a London hospital for clinical training. Sensitive to Inman's disability, the university arranged for him to have individual tuition and training at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, and so he became the first Cambridge medical graduate. After qualifying he spent three years as a junior hospital doctor at Addenbrooke's, before moving to his father's old company, ICI, but in the pharmaceutical division as a medical adviser. On 21 July 1962 he married June Evelyn Halfpenny, a 35-year-old shorthand typist, daughter of Stewart Arthur Maggs, electrical engineer, and widow of Douglas Halfpenny. Friends carried him in his wheelchair up the steps to the registry office in style. They had four daughters, one of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1964, in the wake of the thalidomide disaster in which many thousands of children were born deformed as a result of their mothers taking thalidomide in pregnancy, Inman joined the Department of Health, to work with the newly formed committee on safety of drugs, chaired by Sir Derrick Dunlop. Inman's remit was to develop an early warning system to recognize adverse reactions to medicines. His solution was what came to be known as the &#145;yellow card scheme&#146;, so called because of the yellow forms on which doctors reported any problem experienced by patients suspected to be caused by taking a drug. This scheme stood the test of time as a means of generating signals of drug safety, and Inman used its database to investigate, among other problems, the relationship between oral contraceptives and venous thromboses, and that between the anaesthetic halothane and liver damage. But the yellow card system also suffered drawbacks, the main one being under-reporting. One of the most important examples of this was with the &#145;beta blocker&#146; practolol, which caused severe eye complications, including blindness, in several hundred patients, but there was no signal of this from yellow cards.<br>
<br>Inman believed that a second drug safety alert system was needed to supplement the yellow card scheme, but he found little support for his proposals in the Department of Health. So in 1980 he left the department to set up the Drug Safety Research Unit in Southampton, affiliated to the university there, with Inman as its first professor of pharmaco-epidemiology. He established a new monitoring system for recently introduced drugs, known as prescription event monitoring, in which general practitioners' prescriptions were used to generate a questionnaire to be completed by doctors on some 10,000 or more patients prescribed a new drug, thus providing information on adverse effects. This scheme proved to be complementary to the yellow card scheme, as Inman had hoped, and both formed important parts of the UK's programme to monitor drug safety. His concern for drug safety had an international dimension too. With collaborators he was influential in persuading the World Health Organization to set up its own drug safety monitoring programme.<br>
<br>Perhaps predictably, Inman did not have a comfortable relationship with the industry whose products he was monitoring. He regarded many of its post-marketing safety schemes as being no more than promotional exercises, and he was very critical of the involvement of industry with post-graduate medical education. Equally, his contacts with the Department of Health were not always easy, as he saw the relationship between government and the pharmaceutical industry as being too close. Thus he frequently had problems raising funds for his projects, since both the usual sources were unhelpful.<br>
<br>Inman's immobility from his poliomyelitis did not interfere with a range of physical activities that would have been daunting to an able-bodied person. He learned to fly gliders, continued his earlier passion for fowling, and drove motor cars both in the UK and abroad. He travelled extensively and was in great demand both nationally and internationally on lecture platforms, where he commanded great respect and affection. He retired from the Drug Safety Research Unit in 1994, and became medical vice-president of Remap, a charity run by engineers and physiotherapists that supplied free customized equipment to disabled people. In later years he developed post-polio syndrome, an affliction resembling motor neurone disease, and this led to his death at Southampton General Hospital on 20 October 2005. He was survived by his wife and three daughters.<br>
