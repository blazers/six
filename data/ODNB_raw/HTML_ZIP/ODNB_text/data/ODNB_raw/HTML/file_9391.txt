<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Field,  Nathan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1587, <em>d.</em> 1619/20), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was baptized on 17 October 1587 in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, London, the seventh of seven children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9248/', "Revd John Field (1544/5?&#150;1588)")</script>, a leading puritan, and his wife, Joan. He had two sisters, Dorcas and Elizabeth, and four brothers, John, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9395/', "Theophilus Field")</script>, Jonathan, and Nathaniel. Much of John Field's writing shows his fierce opposition to both bishops and public entertainment. It is a nice irony then that his son Theophilus became bishop of Llandaff, of St David's, and finally of Hereford, while his son Nathan was a renowned player and a playwright. John Field's fourth son, Nathaniel, was a stationer, apprenticed to that profession in 1596. On 20 February 1633 he was buried at St Anne's, Blackfriars, and in March his widow, Anne, was granted letters of administration for his estate. Despite incontrovertible evidence presented by Roberta Brinkley in the 1920s that the unmarried player and playwright Nathan was not the same man as the married stationer Nathaniel, there is still some confusion over the actor's name and history. Fortunately we know what he looked like. There is a portrait of him in Dulwich Picture Gallery  (G. Waterfield and others, <span class="italic">Mr Cartwright's Pictures</span>, 1988).<br>
<br>Nathan Field's professional career began in 1600 while he was a pupil at St Paul's School. He, along with several other children, was &#145;impressed&#146; for a theatre company in Blackfriars, the Children of the Chapel Royal. The master of the Chapel Royal was licensed to take up boy choristers for service in the queen's chapel, but also used this privilege to obtain boy actors for his stage. Field played many parts for this children's company. Humphrey in Beaumont's <span class="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</span> was probably one of his roles, and his name appears on the actor lists for Jonson's <span class="italic">Poetaster</span> and <span class="italic">Epicoene</span>. Field and Jonson seem to have been friends. They read Latin together and Field wrote commendatory verses for two of Jonson's plays, <span class="italic">Volpone</span> and <span class="italic">Catiline</span>. During his time at Blackfriars Field also took part in a number of entertainments in the city, in great houses and at court.<br>
<br>For some thirteen years the boys' company was popular and successful despite its frequent changes of name, organization, and management. However, on at least two occasions Field may have spent time in prison when plays in their repertoire offended the king. Less contentious was Field's own comedy <span class="italic">A Woman is a Weather-Cocke</span> (1612), which was performed at court. His second comedy, <span class="italic">Amends for Ladies</span> (1618), written and performed some time before October 1611, was later revived at the short-lived Porter's Hall theatre in Blackfriars. There are, as one may expect, good roles he might have played in both plays, though we have little evidence about their casting. A merger of the Children of the Queen's Revels with Henslowe's Lady Elizabeth's Men took place in 1613 and Field became their court payee and representative. In 1614 he appeared with the new company in Jonson's <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span>. One scene from the play suggests he played the puppet-master, Littlewit. As he is demonstrating his puppets he is asked, &#145;Which is your Burbage now &hellip; Your best actor, your Field?&#146;  (Brinkley, 19). Littlewit replies by showing the puppet for the romantic lead, Leander, perhaps indicating the type of role for which Field was best-known.<br>
<br>Though the dealings of the Lady Elizabeth's Men with Henslowe were often strained, Field's own relationship with the financier seems to have been friendly. Letters asking for money are signed &#145;yor louing and obedient son&#146; or &#145;yor louing son&#146;. Another letter, written by Field but with postscripts by Daborne and Massinger, shows that they, with Fletcher, were all working on plays for Henslowe  (Greg). It was during his time with the Lady Elizabeth's Men that Field wrote and acted in his tragicomedy <span class="italic">The Honest Man's Fortune</span>. His regular collaborators Massinger and Fletcher also made some small contribution to this play. Like several other Field collaborations, it was not published until 1647 in a folio collection of plays attributed to Beaumont and Fletcher. Another of the works in this 1647 collection is <span class="italic">Four Plays or Moral Representations in One</span> (1612&times;15?), written by Field and Fletcher. &#145;The Triumph of Honour&#146;, &#145;The Triumph of Love&#146;, the &#145;Induction&#146;, and the connecting scenes of this entertainment are all by Field. Earlier he had written a commendatory verse for Fletcher's pastoral <span class="italic">The Faithful Shepherdess</span> (1609?).<br>
<br>Some time before 4 November 1616 Field left the combined companies to join the King's Men. By 28 April 1619 he was a company shareholder. He is listed on the King's Men's licence of 27 March 1619 and on the livery grant of 19 May 1619. In the great folio collection of Shakespeare's plays published in 1623 Field is listed as one of the principal actors. Though we do not know which Shakespearian roles he played, his parts in two Jonsonian revivals by the company are known: Face in <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span> and Voltore in <span class="italic">Volpone</span>. During his time with King's Field continued to write plays with both Massinger and Fletcher and he acted in at least two of their collaborations, <span class="italic">The Queen of Corinth</span> and <span class="italic">The Knight of Malta</span>. All three collaborated on the non-extant &#145;The Jeweller of Amsterdam&#146;, while the tragedy <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span> (first performed 1616 or 1617, published 1632), again with some strong acting roles, was the work of Field and Massinger alone. While with King's Field also appeared in <span class="italic">Thierry and Theodoret</span>, <span class="italic">The Mad Lover</span>, and <span class="italic">The Loyal Subject</span>.<br>
<br>It was about this time that Field wrote <span class="italic">Field the Players Letter to Mr Sutton, Preacher att St Mary Overs</span>. From the pulpit of St Mary Overie, the church that preceded Southwark Cathedral, Thomas Sutton had attacked plays and playing. In his letter Field produced a well-argued, elegantly phrased defence of his profession. In the seventeenth century he was sufficiently well known to be the subject of contemporary gossip. In June 1619, for example, the earl of Argyll was said to be &#145;privy to [a] paiment &hellip; for the noursing of a childe which the worlde sayes is daughter to my lady [Argyll] and N Field the player&#146;  (Brinkley, 42).<br>
<br>Field died some time before 2 August 1620. The letters of administration for his estate granted to his sister Dorcas Rice on that date show that at the time of his death he was living in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Middlesex, and that he was a bachelor. His reputation as an actor lasted well beyond his death. In 1635 the audience at <span class="italic">Wits Triumvirate</span> was expected to recognize differences between Field's acting style and those of Burbage and Alleyn. The prologue to the 1641 edition of <span class="italic">Bussy D'Ambois</span> assumed that an audience would be familiar with his performance in the title role. Even after the Restoration he was still being discussed in the same terms as Burbage. In 1664, for example, Richard Flecknoe placed Field alongside Burbage as &#145;Actors in their greatest flourish&#146;  (Brinkley, 37).<br>
<br>The frequently reproduced Dulwich portrait and the appearance of Field's name on the Shakespeare actor list have ensured that he is remembered as an actor. He must also be recognized as a playwright who, either wholly or in part, wrote at least eight plays. As he says himself, &#145;I haue been vexed with vile plays my selfe, a great while &hellip; nowe &hellip; they shoulde heare mine too&#146;  (&#145;To the Reader&#146;, <span class="italic">Weather-Cocke</span>, 1612).<br>
