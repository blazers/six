<span class="headword">Ferguson,  James</span>  (1621&#150;1667), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was one of the Ferguson family of Kilkerran. After graduating from Glasgow University in 1638 he &#145;preached his first preaching in Kilwinning, March 19 1643&#146; and was ordained its minister in June the same year  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Analecta</span>, 3.44). In August 1648 Ferguson was one of six men called by the general assembly to vacant places in Edinburgh, but his patron, Alexander, earl of Eglintoun, petitioned against his removal. On 10 July 1649 the assembly's committee agreed &#145;that for the special good service that my Lord hath done in this cause, that his lordship shall enjoy his minister, Mr James Fergusin&#146;  (Fraser, 2.312&#150;13).<br>
<br>During the 1650s Ferguson's predecessor at Kilwinning, Robert Baillie, was a close associate and both supported the resolutioners. On 10 March 1651 Baillie wrote to Robert Douglass, moderator of the general assembly at Dundee: &#145;I have sent yow herewith a paper, called Mr James Ferguson's, which hes done good here&#146;, urging in May that Ferguson's opinions be published  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.134). In July 1651 Robert Blair wrote to Douglass that &#145;Mr Ja. Ferguson is a wyss and grave man: I wiss he wer joyned in attendance upon the King&#146;  (ibid., 3.559). In 1655 Ferguson was temporarily drawn towards proposals for unity which Baillie opposed, but the collaboration quickly resumed. Ferguson's practice of praying for the king made him vulnerable:<blockquote>Mr James Fergusone and Mr Alexander Nisbet, by the malevolence of some of their neighbours, were sorely persecute, and chased some weeks from their flocks, and with very much adoe obtained some forbearance of the Generall. How long we shall be spared we cannot tell. (ibid., 3.281&#150;2)</blockquote>At Edinburgh on 9 August 1655 Ferguson married Jean Inglis (<i>d</i>. 1687). They had two sons, James and Hew, and a daughter, Mary. Robert Wodrow's father reported that according to Jean, &#145;ordinarily on the Friday at twelve of the clock, Mr Ferguson took his leave of her, and shutt himself up, and none had access to him till after the sabbath was over&#146;  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Analecta</span>, 1.66).<br>
<br>On 11 November 1658 Baillie reported from Glasgow that Ferguson &#145;was earnestly desired by the town&#146;; he had been offered &#145;both a new church and a new stipend, as good as any other &hellip; most of the session was readie to have accepted it&#146;; but Patrick Gillespie had blocked the proposal  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.383). Again in April 1659, &#145;Mr George Young's congregation did unanimously draw a petition to the session for a call to Mr James Fergusson&#146;  (ibid., 3.394) as Young's replacement, but a politically hostile session rejected the petition as disorderly. In 1660 Earl Alexander and his son wrote to the synod of Glasgow and Ayr to complain against its decision of 3 October summoning Ferguson to take up the chair of divinity at Glasgow; the appointment was delayed until new political conditions made it impossible. Lord Eglintoun was able to keep his minister at Kilwinning, but his power over his dependant had its limits. Ferguson was not afraid to rebuke the members and friends of his patron's family for ungodly speeches or actions, but complained also of their hard dealings: &#145;Ah! for unfaithfulness! Great folk are hard to deal with&#146;  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Analecta</span>, 1.66). When the Second Anglo-Dutch War began a proclamation from London of 3 May 1665 ordered a fast; the presbyterian ministers observed the day on their own terms. For Ferguson in his sermon at Kilwinning, the need for a fast stemmed from &#145;threatened judgements&#146; provoked by the &#145;contempt of the gospel&#146;, displayed in &#145;rough handling of the messengers of Christ, laying desolate multitudes of congregations, contempt of the sabbath, atheistical contempt of ordinances, gross profanity of all kinds&#146;; God had already shown his disapproval, in signs which included the plague then afflicting England  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Sufferings</span>, 1.421).<br>
<br>According to Wodrow, Ferguson was &#145;deeply afflicted with the fall of that worthy company at Pentland&#146;; when visited by Chancellor Cunningham he was openly critical of the &#145;turning out so many minsters, by the act of Glasgow, for nonconformity&#146;  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Analecta</span>, 3.43). His work <span class="italic">A Brief Refutation of the Doctrine of Erastianism</span> maintained that &#145;there is a government appointed by Christ in his Church distinct from the civil Government&#146; which was &#145;in the hands of Christ's own officers&#146;  (p. 3), who had exclusive jurisdiction in matters spiritual. It is reported that just before his death Ferguson renounced his earlier political activism on the side of the resolutioners. He died on 13 March 1667. His widow, Jean, died on 4 January 1687.<br>
