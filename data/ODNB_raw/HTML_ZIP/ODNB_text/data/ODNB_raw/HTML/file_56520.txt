<span class="headword">Colville family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1861&#150;1916), <span class="occ">iron- and steelmasters</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_37305"></a><span class="headword">David [i] Colville</span>  (1811/12&#150;1898)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized in Campbeltown, Argyll, on 17 February 1813, the eleventh and last child of Robert Colvill [<i>sic</i>] and his wife, Janet Mitchell. In early manhood he participated in the family business of owning and controlling a number of coasting vessels and managing several local enterprises, the most important of which was whisky distilling. In the late 1840s he decided to strike out on his own, most probably because his temperance convictions made the family interest in strong drink abhorrent to him. Provided with some capital by his father, he migrated to Glasgow and set up as a provisions merchant in the Trongate. In June 1845 he married Janet (known as Jessie), daughter of the Revd John Barr; they had a family of four sons and seven daughters.<br>
<br>Within a few years Colville had resolved to abandon dealing in tea and coffee, his principal activity, and to enter the buoyant iron trade. Being completely ignorant of iron making, he required a partner possessing the necessary expertise. Such a partner he found in Thomas Gray, the manager of a small malleable-iron works at Coatbridge. The firm of Colville and Gray was established in June 1861 with a capital of &pound;6500, of which Colville provided &pound;5000. Although the Clifton ironworks was successful, relations between the two men began to deteriorate when Gray's drinking habits became intolerable to Colville. It was resolved to dissolve the partnership in 1870 and to sell the going concern to the partner submitting the higher bid. Colville put in a most generous offer and was mortified to lose out to Gray, who had gained the backing of a Mr Wylie, a licensed grocer and former provost of Hamilton, who saw the Clifton works as both a sound investment and a thriving business in which his sons could become interested.<br>
<br>It was a bitter disappointment to Colville but, unexpectedly provided with ample funds from the sale of his three-fourths share in the firm, he decided to set up another ironworks entirely under his own control, in the management of which he would be assisted by two of his sons, <a name="cosubject_56520"></a><span class="headword">John Colville</span>  (1852&#150;1901)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_51856"></a><span class="headword">Archibald Colville</span>  (1853&#150;1916)<span class="occ"></span>. John Colville was born on 3 July 1852 at Glasgow, and acquired a knowledge of iron manufacture at the Clifton works. He married, first, Janet, daughter of Dr Joseph Brown of Glasgow, and then Christian, the daughter of Provost Downie of Kirkintillock, with whom he had one son and one daughter. Archibald Colville was born in 1853 in Glasgow, and received a commercial training at the famous East India trading house of James Finlay &amp; Co. He married Jeannie Miller, and they had two sons and five daughters. The search for a possible location led to David [i] Colville's accepting the offer of a suitable site on highly favourable terms by the agents of the Hamiltons of Dalzell, who were anxious to develop their estates around the small burgh. Construction began in February 1871 and in just over a year the first of the twenty furnaces was commissioned. Rolling began two weeks later in April 1872.<br>
<br>While Colville was laying down the Dalzell works, the Steel Company of Scotland was established. Within a few years it had become apparent that steel would displace malleable iron as the basic raw material in the heavy industries of the west of Scotland. Keenly aware of this possibility, David [i] Colville sent his youngest son to the Steel Company's Hallside works to be fully trained in the new technology. This was <a name="cosubject_56521"></a><span class="headword">David [ii] Colville</span>  (1860&#150;1916)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 10 March 1860 at Coatbridge, Lanarkshire; and who married Katherine Harvey, daughter of Robert Greenlees, distiller, on 18 August 1887. They had one son and one daughter. The consequence of David [ii] Colville's training was that, having successfully established himself in iron making, his father, David [i] Colville, at an age when the majority of wealthy businessmen had retired to their country estates, decided to go into steel.<br>
<br>A licence was obtained from William Siemens, the firm's capital (already enhanced by the retention of the profits resulting from the supply of iron bars for the rebuilding of the Tay Bridge) being doubled by a loan of &pound;33,000 from J. S. Napier, a Glasgow iron merchant. Under the direction of David [ii] Colville five 10 ton open-hearth furnaces, a rolling mill, and ancilliary plant were erected at Dalzell. The first melt of steel was made in 1881. On this occasion the timing could not have been more auspicious: it was during the 1880s, when mild steel drove wrought iron from the Clydeside shipyards. The works prospered and were further extended (again partially with Napier's help), and net profits, which fuelled the expansion, rose to reach &pound;50,000 in the second half of 1889.<br>
<br>Not until the early 1890s did David [i] Colville allow control of his firm to pass to his sons; and not until the redemption of the loans from Napier and the election of his eldest son, John, to parliament as Liberal member for North-East Lanarkshire in 1895 would he countenance the conversion of the partnership into a private limited company. Three years later he died at Glasgow, on 29 October 1898, aged eighty-six. His wife predeceased him. A quiet, abstemious man, David [i] Colville devoted himself almost entirely to his business, taking little part in public life. A paternalistic figure, all the evidence confirms the accuracy of contemporary, eulogistic accounts of his high moral character. He was deeply religious, an ardent temperance reformer, and universally trusted. &#145;His manner&#146;, observed an anonymous obituarist in <span class="italic">Engineering</span>, &#145;was that of the old school&#151;courteous and gentle, and guileless to a degree, nevertheless he possessed great strength of purpose&#146;  (<span class="italic">Engineering</span>, 4 Nov 1898, 581).<br>
<br>David [i] Colville left his sons a thriving business and they pushed it forward. David [ii] Colville was the driving force behind the policy of expansion and continuous modernization which by the eve of the First World War made the firm the largest in the Scottish steel industry and second only to Dorman Longs in Great Britain. While his older brother John&#151;the first chairman of the limited company&#151;became increasingly absorbed by public works, serving the community by promoting the causes of religion, temperance, and social reform, and Archibald grappled with the commercial and financial implications of his brother's plans, David [ii] scoured Europe and America to investigate and adopt the latest steelmaking practices, dealt ruthlessly with the growing and increasingly well organized labour forces either personally or, with somewhat greater tact, through the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration of the Manufactured Steel Trade of the West of Scotland, and secured the loyalty of the senior managers by offering them shares in the company.<br>
<br>David [ii] captured the imagination by his flamboyance and his grand manner. He was the master of the firm. His ambitions were constrained only by his older brother Archibald, chairman of the company after John's sudden death at Cleland House, Motherwell, Lanarkshire, on 22 August 1901. John's wife survived him. Archibald was shrewd and calculating&#151;reputed, as the labour leader John Hodge put it, &#145;to have an absolute knowledge of how many beans make five&#146;  (Hodge, 34). But the exigencies of the war gave David his chance to break free from the constraints imposed by his brother. He willingly agreed to meet the government's request for a massive increase of steel output and, with the backing of the Ministry of Munitions, took over the Clydebridge and Glengarnock works, gained control of Fullwood foundry, and purchased the ordinary shares of a major colliery company, Archibald Russell Ltd, in order to safeguard his fuel supplies. The physical and mental strain of such rapid growth proved too much. David Colville collapsed and died on 16 October 1916 at Jerviston House, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. His wife survived him. He was fifty-six. Two months later Archibald, utterly exhausted with the effort of implementing his brother's schemes, succumbed to a brief illness at the age of sixty-three and died on 11 December 1916 at The Moorings, Clyde Street, Motherwell. He also left a widow.<br>
<br>The third generation of Colvilles were all either serving in the army or too inexperienced to assume the leadership of the company and the task fell upon one of the very managers whom David had admitted to the firm, John Craig (1874&#150;1957). Not until <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63309/', "Ronald John Bilsland Colville, second Baron Clydesmuir (1917&#150;1996)")</script>, John Colville's grandson, became a member of the board in 1958 was a member of the Colville family again to play a major role in running the concern, but within a decade Colvilles had passed into the hands of the state, becoming a major constituent of the British Steel Corporation.<br>
