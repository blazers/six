<span class="headword">Barton,  Richard</span>  (1706&#150;1759), <span class="occ">topographer and religious writer</span>, was born in Painstown, co. Meath, Ireland, the third son of the Revd John Barton (<i>fl</i>. 1675&#150;1735), dean of Ardagh, and Elinor Jenney, daughter of the Revd Henry Jenney, archdeacon of Dromore diocese, and granddaughter of Sir William Brownlow, a leading protestant in co. Armagh in the 1620s. He was first educated privately by the leading pedagogue Dr Thomas Sheridan, and he matriculated on 9 February 1722 at Trinity College, Dublin. There he became a scholar in 1724 and graduated BA in the spring of 1726, proceeding MA in 1731. Like his two elder brothers, he followed his father into the Church of Ireland; he became a deacon in 1728 and was ordained the following year. He never married, and followed his clerical career with great dedication. He was curate of Donaghcloney, co. Down, in the diocese of Dromore, between 1728 and 1742 and then rector of Shankhill, near Lurgan, co. Armagh, between 1742 and 1759.<br>
<br>Barton's duties as a Church of Ireland clergyman were taken seriously by him and went hand in hand with his topographical and natural history work. He later recorded his work, in his first curacy in Donaghcloney, of evangelizing among Catholics in the area, though he eschewed the use of the Irish language as it was a sign of barbarity and preferred to use English to erode the &#145;lairs of the wild beasts&#146;. He also interested himself in the theological controversies of the time and in 1751 published <span class="italic">The Analogy of Divine Wisdom</span>, an attack on those Arian ideas on the Trinity held not only in England but in the Irish episcopacy by Bishop Clayton of Clogher. He was praised by John Wesley on his tour through co. Armagh in 1756 as a clergyman who had forgone likely preferment to concentrate on his mission around Lurgan and his evangelical preaching in a town described earlier by Jonathan Swift as a pleasant place in which to live &#145;if it had not been for the Quakers, Presbyterians and Papists then beginning to inhabit it&#146;  (Lodge MS, G. IV. 5, fol. 82).<br>
<br>Wesley also recorded something of Barton's eccentricity on his visit in 1756, pointing out that he lived in a house near Lough Neagh with no doors and few windows. Barton's other source of fame was his concentration for nearly twenty years from the early 1730s on the topography and natural history of Lough Neagh and its hinterland. In 1738 he was already in touch with the noted historian and topographer Walter Harris, who later founded the Physico-Historical Society and recorded Barton's name as the natural history &#145;inquirer&#146; or collector of information for co. Armagh for the society. Barton joined Harris's society, and there are several letters from him in 1745 recording his work on a dictionary of place names for the county (which has been lost) and his continuing experiments on the petrifying qualities of Lough Neagh, a topic which fascinated many eighteenth-century natural historians.<br>
<br>In connection with this work Barton published in 1751 <span class="italic">Lectures in Natural Philosophy</span>, which looked at current knowledge in that field and added findings from his local lough on geology and both medicinal and mechanical properties of the waters, and <span class="italic">A Dialogue Concerning Something of Importance to Ireland, Particularly to the County of Armagh</span>, which was intended to encourage funding and support for a full civil and topographical survey of that county in the wake of the Physico-Historical Society's collapse. Although these appeals proved unsuccessful all of Barton's books were well subscribed, particularly the first, which had more than 550 subscriptions. Barton remained in Lurgan throughout these years; he died and was buried there on 6 August 1759.<br>
