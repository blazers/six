<span class="headword">Beck,  Adolf</span>  (1841&#150;1909), <span class="occ">businessman and victim of two miscarriages of justice</span>, was born in Christiansund, Norway, on 14 June 1841, the son of a trader and ship's captain. Leaving school at sixteen, he led a restless, wandering, and varied life. He was a clerk in merchants' offices, studied industrial chemistry privately, and went to sea, before reaching Britain in 1865 or 1866, where he worked in shipping offices in six ports between Cardiff and Aberdeen. Beck also attempted to become a professional singer. In 1868 he went to South America, where he stayed until 1884, spending time in almost every country of the subcontinent, and making enough money to buy an unprofitable Norwegian copper mine. He arrived in London in 1885, but did not prosper, falling into debt, borrowing money from, and courting&#151;but not marrying&#151;several women. In his later years he was often seen in the company of prostitutes (which may explain the number of women later claiming to identify him in court).<br>
<br>In 1896, and again in 1904, Beck was convicted&#151;wrongly as it subsequently appeared&#151;at the Old Bailey of defrauding numerous women of doubtful character of their jewellery. Seventeen women&#151;eleven in 1896 and six in 1904&#151;mistakenly identified him as the man who, masquerading as Lord Willoughby or Lord Wilton, had deceived them. This was, however, fewer than half the total number of complainants, none of whose property was traced to him. The swindler was in fact an Austrian or German Jew known at different times in England and Australia (where for several years he practised medicine successfully) by a variety of names, both German and English, who had first been convicted (as Thomas Smith) of seventeen very similar frauds in 1877, and sentenced to five years' penal servitude.<br>
<br>The frauds resumed in 1895 and Beck was arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to seven years' penal servitude, after the women's identifications had been confirmed by the police constable, now retired, who had arrested &#145;Smith&#146; in 1877. These mistakes were compounded by the judge, Sir Forrest Fulton, the common serjeant, wrongly refusing to admit the evidence of a handwriting expert, which would have established that the 1877 and the 1895 swindler was, as indeed the prosecution believed, the same person. This would have exonerated Beck, since he could have proved that in 1877 he was in Peru. In addition, the prison authorities soon became aware that Beck, being uncircumcised, and having blue, not brown eyes, was not &#145;Smith&#146;, and accordingly allotted him a new prison number. But the Home Office officials who reported this discovery to Fulton did not recognize its crucial significance, and nor did he.<br>
<br>Released in 1901 after serving five years, Beck was re-arrested in 1904 on similar charges and was again convicted. As the law in 1896 stood, Beck could not himself have given evidence; in 1904 he could have given it but, with the 1896 conviction still standing, was advised not to. This time the judge, Sir William Grantham, doubted the jury's verdict, and while further inquiries were being made &#145;Smith&#146; was arrested for trying to pawn a stolen ring and confessed to all the frauds. Beck was at once pardoned for the crimes he had not committed and received &pound;2000 (later increased to &pound;5000) compensation. The subsequent inquiry (chaired by Sir Richard Henn Collins, master of the rolls) placed, absurdly, all the blame on the absence of legally trained civil servants in the Home Office, and did not recommend the establishment of a criminal appeal court. But the case for it was overwhelming. Had it existed in 1896, Fulton's erroneous ruling at Beck's first trial might have been successfully challenged.<br>
<br>The egregious injustice to Beck made irresistible the sixty-year long, and thirty-parliamentary bill, campaign for a court of criminal appeal empowered to quash convictions for errors of fact as of law, which the judiciary and successive home secretaries had persistently opposed. The <span class="roman">Court of Criminal Appeal Act</span> of 1907 followed. The new court's judges adopted, however, an exceedingly narrow view of its powers, and devoted most of their attention to reducing scandalous disparities in sentencing. Responsibility for investigating and referring claimed miscarriages of justice to the court of appeal criminal division (as the court of criminal appeal became in 1968) was transferred from the Home Office to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 1996. Not until then did England begin to have anything approaching a satisfactory system for remedying them. Beck, who soon spent the compensation money, died of pleurisy and bronchitis on 7 December 1909 in the Middlesex Hospital, London.<br>
