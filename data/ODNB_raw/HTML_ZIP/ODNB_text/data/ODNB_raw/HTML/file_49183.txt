<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blunt,  Alfred Walter Frank</span>  (1879&#150;1957), <span class="occ">bishop of Bradford</span>, was born in St Malo, France, on 24 September 1879, son of Francis Theophilus Blunt (1837&#150;1881) of the colonial service and his wife, Emily Ellen Hobart Rainsford (<i>d</i>. 1911). The second of two sons, with three older half-siblings from a previous marriage, he was educated by his mother after his father's death in 1881, and then at Church Hill preparatory school at Crondall, near Farnham. In 1893 he went to Marlborough College, and then studied classics at Exeter College, Oxford (1897&#150;1901). He studied education for a term before teaching at Wellington College (1902) and taking up a classical fellowship and tutorship at Exeter College. He attended Cuddesdon Theological College, where he was ordained in 1904, and took up a curacy at St John the Evangelist, Carrington, Nottingham, in 1907. Here he ministered energetically to an industrial parish, distinguished himself as an accomplished preacher, and arrived at the conviction, which he held for the rest of his life, that &#145;The Gospel is intended both for individual redemption and for social amelioration&#146;  (Peart-Binns, 50), a statement which explains both his Christian socialism and his willingness to support controversial causes such as women's suffrage. At Carrington, too, under the influence of his bishop, Edwyn Hoskyns, he acquired an enduring sense of the catholicity of the church, and of its relevance to every aspect of individual and social life, and began to publish his first books on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. On 20 October 1909 he married Margaret (Maggie) Catherine Duke, the daughter of a doctor in the Indian Medical Service.<br>
<br>In 1917 Blunt was appointed vicar of St Werburgh's, Derby, another industrial slum parish. He was offered the bishopric of Worcester in 1930, and after a lively correspondence with the then prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, about the episcopal residence, Hartlebury Castle, which he regarded as &#145;a white elephant&#146;  (Binns, 83), he refused the offer for private reasons and was appointed bishop of Bradford in 1931. As bishop he appealed to a broad Anglicanism which was both traditionalist and progressive, even-handedly encouraging the Anglo-Catholics in the diocese and reversing some of the strictness of his evangelical predecessor, acting as president of an Anglo-Catholic congress in Bradford in 1934. He continued to prefer ministry in the slums and youth work to convocation or church assembly meetings. A member of the Christian Social Union since 1907, and a member of the Labour Party since the general strike (1926), Blunt paid unofficial visits to factories and preached widely on unemployment, presiding over clergy conferences on the subject in 1933. He told the diocesan conference in 1936 that &#145;The Church must preach to the rich of the &#147;deceitfulness of riches&#148;&#146;  (Peart-Binns, 178&#150;9), arousing a chorus of protests from tory MPs. Blunt was the author of a number of books. Works such as <span class="italic">The Faith of the Catholic Church</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Our Need of God</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">What the Church Teaches</span> (1942) embodied his social and religious concerns.<br>
<br>The rejection of the 1928 prayer book affected him deeply, confirming his belief in the spiritual autonomy of the church and convincing him of the virtues of disestablishment. It was this conviction which made him the centre of controversy, when, on 1 December 1936, he addressed the Bradford diocesan conference on the coronation of Edward VIII. Bishop Barnes of Birmingham had suggested that there should be no communion service at the coronation in order to allow nonconformists to participate; Blunt argued<blockquote>To allow such another measure of covert piecemeal disestablishment is to make the worst of both worlds&#151;to retain the invidiousness, such as it is, of the name of establishment, while losing one by one every item of reality which the term connotes, and abandoning without defence any claim which we may make to have a contribution of spiritual grace to offer to the acts of the State. (Peart-Binns, 275)</blockquote>He added that the sacramental effectiveness of the coronation depended, among other things,<blockquote>on the faith, prayer and self-dedication of the King himself; and on that it would be improper for me to say anything except to commend him &hellip; to God's grace &hellip; We hope that he is aware of his need. Some of us wish that he gave more positive signs of such awareness. (ibid., 277)</blockquote>Blunt's speech was a plea for the church to accept the spiritual responsibilities, rather than merely the privileges, conferred upon it by establishment at a time when &#145;Our civilization is in a tottering and unstable condition&#146;  (ibid., 278), but his statement unfortunately coincided with revelations in the press about the king's affair with Mrs Simpson, and was widely interpreted as a veiled allusion to it. The king himself regarded Blunt's statement as &#145;the spark that caused the explosion&#146;  (duke of Windsor, 349).<br>
<br>When Sir Richard Acland proposed to the Malvern conference (which brought together 400 Anglican priests and laity in 1941) that the church should condemn &#145;the present form of private ownership as a stumbling block to the Christian way of life&#146;, Blunt was vocal in his support, and when the Beveridge report was published in 1943, he urged the convocation of York to welcome it as a positive solution to problems of poverty and unemployment. In answer to those who accused him of meddling in politics, he responded<blockquote>that in the last two centuries the churches in England (and elsewhere) have largely been content to preach only part of the gospel of Christ. They have preached conversion to individuals; they have not preached the Kingdom of God to society. Christ preached both. (Peart-Binns, 187)</blockquote>He had continued to move to the left politically, advocating communism in wartime, while being deeply critical of the Russian variety of it, leading the <span class="italic">Church Times</span> editor, Sydney Dark, to praise him as the &#145;most courageous Churchman of our time&#146;, while arousing the indignation of Lord Vansittart. A firm opponent of appeasement and an advocate of British rearmament during the late 1930s, Blunt rejected pacifism, but was also rigidly opposed to the hate campaigns of Vansittartism. In response to a series of broadcasts by Vansittart, later published as <span class="italic">Black Record</span>, he remarked, &#145;It would be easy to write a similar Black Record of Britain which would prove that our policy had been sympathetically one of economic grab and exploitation, and that, if the Germans are &#147;butcher birds&#148;, the British are harpies&#146;  (ibid., 204).<br>
<br>From 1931 onwards Blunt suffered from a series of nervous illnesses which led him to proclaim that &#145;Life is crucifixion&#146;  (Peart-Binns, 242). The perfectionism with which he regarded preaching and liturgy, combined with the constant controversy engendered by his political activism, both took their toll. In 1955 he was compelled to retire after a stroke. His health continued to decline and he died in York on 2 June 1957 and was buried at Calverley. He was survived by his wife. His ministry had been marked by a sincerity which at times made his surname seem singularly appropriate, and while this may have cost him ecclesiastical preferment, it was also true that his faith was thoroughly in keeping with his rebellious nature: &#145;It is not supreme law which we worship, but God. It is not the Christian character which we imitate, but Christ. And it is in relation to this fact that Christianity justifies itself&#146;  (ibid., 66).<br>
