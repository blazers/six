<span class="headword">Roos <span class="st"> [Ros]</span>, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1410&#150;1482), <span class="occ">courtier and poet</span>, was the fifth son in the family of five sons and four daughters of William, seventh Baron Ros of Helmsley (<i>c</i>.1369&#150;1414), and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1438), daughter of Sir John Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1379), naval commander. His kneeling figure appears in the St William window (<i>c</i>.1423) in York Minster, which commemorates his father. In 1435&#150;9 he is heard of lodging in the &#145;cornertowre&#146; at a property in Penshurst, Kent. He was serving in France in December 1436 under John Talbot, first earl of Shrewsbury (<i>d</i>. 1453), at Gisors, and was by then a knight. In November 1444 he was among the knights in the English party that went to France to witness the proxy wedding of Henry VI with Margaret of Anjou, and is mentioned as a participant in the dress rehearsal of her royal entry into Rouen in 1445. Later in that year, after the queen had been escorted to England, Roos was appointed constable of St Briavels Castle, Gloucestershire, for life, and, in December, received a grant from the king of 1500 livres tournois for the defraying of the expenses of his French journey. His name appears among the &#145;promoters of the establishment&#146; at the foundation of Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1448.<br>
<br>Early in the 1450s Roos married Margaret, daughter of Sir Richard Vernon of Haddon (<i>d</i>. 1451). She may have been the widow of Richard Longueville. In 1454 he was aulnager for Northamptonshire and Rutland, charged with examining the measurement and quality of woollen goods in those counties. There are records of various annuities and grants, and of the burglary of his house in Baynard's Castle ward, London, in November 1445. The events of the last part of his life remain obscure, but his will, drawn up on 8 March 1482 and proved on 1 April 1482, implies that he held some post at the court of Edward IV. It shows him to be a man of sufficient moveable property but with hardly any land. There are benefactions to the church of St Peter Paul's Wharf in Thames Street and to the Carmelites in Fleet Street, in whose church, the Whitefriars', he directs that his body be interred. He bequeaths a number of books: a &#145;little booke of praiers&#146; and service books belonging to his chapel, &#145;my saulter clasped with silver&#146;, and &#145;my grete booke called saint Grall&#146;  (Seaton, 547&#150;50). The last volume survives in the British Library as Royal MS 14 E.iii. His wife, Margaret, survived him; they had a daughter, Mary, who married Sir Giles Capel.<br>
<br>Roos is usually taken to be the author of a polished English version of Alain Chartier's poem of <i>c</i>.1424, &#145;La belle dame sans mercy&#146;, a fashionable contribution to the courtly debate about love provoked by the <span class="italic">Roman de la rose</span>. It was printed in Pynson's edition of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Boke of Fame</span>, and in other early editions of Chaucer, but Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax 16, in which it appears, was produced <i>c</i>.1450 (a contemporary hand has written <i>anno 1450</i> on folio i <i>recto</i>). This manuscript belonged to the Stanley family: the Stanley coat of arms which it contains has been identified as that of the elder branch of the Stanleys of Hooton. The manuscript was possibly commissioned by Sir John Stanley, who was Roos's wife's brother-in-law; Sir John's death <i>c</i>.1469 would provide a <i>terminus ad quem</i>. In BL, Harley MS 372, the work is ascribed to Sir Richard Roos, and this has been generally accepted. If it is not, a claim could be made for his nephew, Richard Roos, esquire (1429&#150;1493?), a correspondent of the Pastons, who seems to have been a respected figure, but was never knighted. An erudite attempt by Ethel Seaton to prove (by the use of anagrams and hidden word play) that Sir Richard was the author of a number of other fifteenth-century poems has not won acceptance.<br>
