<span class="headword">Turner,  Thomas</span>  (1729&#150;1793), <span class="occ">diarist and shopkeeper</span>, was born on 9 June 1729 at Groombridge in the parish of Speldhurst, Kent, the eldest of the four children of John Turner (1689&#150;1752), a shopkeeper, and his second wife, Elizabeth Ovenden (1697&#150;1759), of Rotherfield, Sussex. In 1735 the family moved to Framfield, Sussex, where John Turner took a shop and from where Thomas's two brothers, Moses and Richard, were apprenticed to their father's trade. Nothing is known of Thomas's schooling and apprenticeship, but by the time that he was twenty-one (in 1750) he had leased a shop in East Hoathly, Sussex, and had acquired the ability to reckon and cast accounts and to write a bold, clear hand.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1753 Turner married Margaret (Peggy) Slater (1733&#150;1761) in Lewes. She was the daughter of a Hartfield farming couple, Samuel and Ann Slater. The marriage was not always happy; Margaret's health was not good, she was frequently not as helpful in the shop as Turner would have liked, and her mother proved a thorn in Turner's side. Their only child, Peter, who was born on 19 August 1754, lived for less than five months, and Margaret herself died, after a long illness, on 23 June 1761.<br>
<br>Early in his married life Turner began keeping a diary, the first surviving entry in which is dated 21 February 1754. The diary chronicles in detail the next eleven years not only of the life of a busy, worried, and frequently unhappy supplier of virtually every retail commodity to a rural community, but also of the life of the community itself. East Hoathly, on the edge of the Sussex Weald, was an agricultural village with a population of some 350 people. Turner recorded its activities at a time when the Seven Years' War brought constant rumours of a threat to invade from across the channel, and when, within the parish's western boundary, stood Halland House (since demolished), the Sussex mansion of the duke of Newcastle, first lord of the Treasury for almost eight of the diary years.<br>
<br>Within this community Turner played an essential role. His shop was a centre for the gathering and dissemination of information, he was the local expert in money matters, he was the village undertaker, he wrote wills, kept accounts, collected taxes, served in one parish office after another, aided successive excisemen, surveyed fields, conducted auctions, and at one stage kept the village school. All these activities he chronicled in detail, embellishing his narrative with vivid thumbnail word sketches of his contemporaries, whether friends or enemies. In addition the diary gives details of his extensive reading and of his activities as drinking companion, party-goer, and cricketer.<br>
<br>The diary has never been published in full and until 1984 the only publicly available extracts were those first given in the article in the <span class="italic">Sussex Archaeological Collections</span> for 1859 by R. W. Blencowe and M. A. Lower, whose purpose was to contrast fashionable mid-nineteenth-century Sussex with the &#145;secluded and uncivilized&#146; county of one hundred years before. These extracts, re-edited by F. M. Turner in 1925 and again by G. H. Jennings in 1979, did Turner no service, and it was as something of a figure of fun that he was noted by subsequent writers on diarists from Charles Dickens  (<span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, 13 April 1861) onwards. Vaisey's edition of 1984 reproduces about one third of the whole and shows Turner to have been an important observer of eighteenth-century life.<br>
<br>The surviving 111 volumes of the diary end with an entry written on 31 July 1765 recording Turner's marriage on 19 June to Mary (Molly) Hicks (1735&#150;1807), daughter of Thomas and Mary Hicks of Chiddingly, Sussex. Turner lived on in East Hoathly for twenty-eight years after he stopped writing his diary, and during those years he prospered. He acquired land, and bought both his shop and the principal public house in the village. Seven children (two of whom died in infancy) were born of his second marriage, and at least two of his sons carried on the trade. He died on 6 February 1793 at East Hoathly and was buried in the churchyard there on 11 February. A table-tomb marks his grave. His house in the village bears a plaque recording his residence. His widow survived him by fourteen years and was buried at East Hoathly on 1 December 1807.<br>
