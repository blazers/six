<span class="headword">Skelton,  Kenneth John Fraser</span>  (1918&#150;2003), <span class="occ">bishop of Lichfield</span>, was born on 16 May 1918 at 21 Lynton Road, Hornsey, London, the eldest son of Henry Edmund Skelton and his wife, Kate Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mann. At the time of his birth his father was serving as a gunner in the 128th heavy battery. Skelton's father had an inherent disposition for minutiae, method, calculation, and seriousness befitting his peacetime occupation as a watchmaker and jeweller. These traits were later evident in his son, who was a small, somewhat dapper, figure, shy, self-effacing, and straightforward.<br>
<br>Skelton won a scholarship to Dulwich College in 1929, thence to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he achieved a double first. Following his vocation he trained at Wells Theological College and was ordained in 1941, serving curacies in three Derbyshire parishes, in one of which he met Phyllis Barbara Emerton, daughter of James Emerton; during the Second World War she served as a WAAF officer. They married at St Giles' Church, Normanton-by-Derby, on 17 July 1945, and later had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>After returning to Wells as lecturer and priest-vicar of the cathedral in 1946, Skelton developed a thoughtful radical theology. In 1950 he moved to Manchester as vicar of Howe Bridge, a small mining village. This bespectacled, hesitant, and donnish vicar did not at first appeal to Lancashire parishioners, but they soon realized that behind his unassuming presence was a very determined person who had the steel and drive to ensure that his goals were achieved. Thus proven, Skelton left in 1955 for seven years as rector of the ancient parish of Walton-on-the-Hill, Liverpool. There he was dynamic, propelling people to think and act on contemporary social and moral issues.<br>
<br>The diocese of Matabeleland in Rhodesia elected Skelton as its bishop in 1962. Two years later Ian Smith took over the Rhodesian Front and began actively pressing for independence. From the outset Skelton was fearless, tapping away on his typewriter, turning blank sheets of paper into missiles aimed at government policies. He was rarely out of the newspapers and was dubbed &#145;a political bishop&#146; by government ministers, who referred to him as Red Skelton. He deliberately embarked on a collision course with the government, an episcopal thorn in its side, as it inexorably moved towards the unilateral declaration of independence on 11 November 1965. Skelton was a hero to the black African community, with whom he spent extended time on pastoral visits, while many Europeans opposed his views. Skelton sent confidential reports to the prime minister, Harold Wilson, whose Labour Party had come to power in 1964, and wrote controversial (though anonymous) articles for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. He &#145;spied&#146; for MI6 after meetings with Maurice Oldfield. To thwart the police bugging of his telephone he spoke to Cecil Alderson of Mashonaland, the other Anglican bishop in Rhodesia, in Latin. He was in touch with many supporters of Joshua Nkomo, leader of the Zimbabwean African People's Union. By 1969 it was clear that the Rhodesian government would find grounds for removing him, and there were death threats. Skelton had the moral fibre to face any consequence of his actions but he was also married&#151;with three children being educated in England&#151;and pressures on his family prompted a return to England. He was appointed CBE in 1972.<br>
<br>On Skelton's return to England, Ian Ramsey, bishop of Durham, invited him to be rector of Bishopwearmouth and assistant bishop in the diocese. Then in April 1974 there came an invitation from Harold Wilson to accept nomination to the see of Lichfield, one of the largest dioceses in England. There he succeeded the respected and conservative Stretton Reeve. To the existing suffragan bishoprics of Shrewsbury and Stafford, Skelton added Wolverhampton in 1979, inaugurating a full area system. He had the ability to delegate without abrogating responsibility, although he could be insensitive to those who disagreed with him, and disliked outside interference. Anglo-Catholics were uneasy with a liberal bishop, the &#145;county set&#146; was shunned, and relations with successive deans in a rather Trollopian close were strained. The Bishop's House may have been a palace but the Skeltons lived simply, almost frugally, in an upstairs flat; yet their hospitality was warm and genuine.<br>
<br>Skelton was an indefatigable worker, never in bed before midnight. He had an inner strength and spiritual integrity which enabled him to be decisive and imperturbable in all situations, and he relied on intuition and his own inquiries when making senior appointments. His relaxed style of leadership was rewarded by two celebrations in Stafford at the county showground, attended by huge crowds. His addresses to the diocesan synod arrested attention with their clarity of thought and pellucid expression. Yet he was never a churchy figure. His blood pressure shot up when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister, although his declarations about contemporary social and moral issues affecting ordinary people came from a Christian, not from a party-political, stance. He chaired a commission which produced <span class="italic">Marriage and the Church's Task</span> (1978). The report was not unanimous on the crucial proposal that divorcees should be allowed to remarry in church. When Skelton presented the commission's findings to the general synod, the archbishop of Canterbury made an ex cathedra pronouncement condemning it, but it was only narrowly defeated.<br>
<br>Skelton retired in 1984 to Sheffield, and was made an assistant bishop in the dioceses of Sheffield and Derby. He was never happier than when playing the organ. He could have been a professional musician had he not been ordained. He also retained a good tenor voice to the end, singing oratorios and masses. His last years were clouded by illness. His wife died in 2002 and he followed her, at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey, on 30 July 2003, after a stroke. He was survived by his three children.<br>
