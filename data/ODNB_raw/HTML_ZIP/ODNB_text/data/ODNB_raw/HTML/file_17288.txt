<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lyons,  Edmund</span>, first Baron Lyons  (1790&#150;1858), <span class="occ">naval officer and diplomatist</span>, the fourth son of John Lyons of Antigua and St Austen's, Lymington, in Hampshire, was born on 29 November 1790 at Burton, Christchurch, Hampshire. Vice Admiral John Lyons (<i>d</i>. 1872), for many years in the Egyptian service, was his elder brother. Lyons went to sea with his godfather, a friend of his father's, Admiral Sir Richard Hussey Bickerton, in the <i>Terrible</i> in 1798; after this he attended Hyde Abbey School near Winchester until 1803, when he joined the frigate <i>Active</i>, commanded by Bickerton's cousin, Captain Richard Hussey Moubray. He remained in her for four years, serving at the passage of the Dardanelles by Sir John Duckworth in February 1807. Shortly afterwards Lyons went to the East Indies; he was appointed acting lieutenant in the following year, and commissioned on 22 November 1809. On 9 August 1810 he took a notable part in the capture of Banda Neira, principal island in the Banda group, west of New Guinea. Lyons then served as flag lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Drury aboard the <i>Minden</i> (74 guns). In 1811 the fleet was preparing to capture the heavily fortified port of Marrack, south west of Batavia, but a boat attack was postponed on receipt of intelligence that additional Dutch troops had arrived. On 25 July 1811 Lyons was sent to land Dutch prisoners; on his way back to the fleet, having had a clear sight of the defences, he decided to attack the fort by surprise. On 30 July, shortly before midnight, he landed with only thirty-four men under the embrasures of the fort. This small force stormed and captured the battery, and then Lyons led a charge that dispersed the garrison. When the Dutch troops returned they were driven off by two heavy guns. Lyons then dismantled the fort, spiked the guns and withdrew his men. His actions were highly praised, and although <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3593/', "Commodore Broughton's")</script> dispatch did not lead to a promotion he was noted at the Admiralty for early elevation to the rank of commander. This action was widely regarded as the most outstanding example of individual bravery in the wars which followed the French Revolution, and lived in the memory of the service for decades.<br>
<br>Lyons continued off Java, commanding captured gunboats and serving ashore until his health broke down and he returned to Britain. He was promoted commander on 21 March 1812. In 1813 he commanded the brig <i>Rinaldo</i> in the channel, and on 7 June 1814 he was posted captain. In the same year he married Augusta Louisa, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23990/', "Captain Josias Rogers RN")</script>; they had two sons and two daughters. He remained unemployed until 1828, when he commanded the frigate <i>Blonde</i> in the Mediterranean, during the closing stages of the Greek war of independence, co-operating with French troops at the capture of Kastro Morea, in the Peloponnese, for which he was awarded French and Greek orders. In 1829, while attending the British ambassador in Constantinople, the <i>Blonde</i> cruised around the Black Sea, and became the first British warship to visit Sevastopol, the Caucasus, and Odessa. Twenty-five years later Lyons was to be the only senior officer with experience of this sea. In 1831 Lyons moved into the <i>Madagascar</i>, and in 1833 he escorted the new King Otho from Trieste to Athens. On paying off in January 1835 he was made KCH and appointed minister and plenipotentiary at Athens, where he remained for almost fifteen years. He proved less satisfactory as an ambassador than as a naval officer, lacking subtlety and often resorting to hectoring and overbearing methods. On 29 July 1840 he was created baronet, and in July 1844 he was made a civil GCB. Between 1849 and 1851 he was minister to the Swiss confederation; he then moved to Stockholm, where his wife died. Lyons, who remained on the navy list, had reached the rank of rear-admiral on 14 January 1850. In November 1853 he was appointed second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet, with his flag aboard the new screw steam battleship <i>Agamemnon</i> (91 guns).<br>
<br>Lyons's appointment was well calculated for coalition warfare, particularly where the command was shared by four senior officers. His linguistic skills and diplomatic experience added a new dimension to the planning of the allied forces. In addition Lyons's character and energy were in marked contrast to the calm, measured approach of the commander-in-chief, Vice-Admiral Sir James Dundas. Lyons was in direct personal correspondence with the first lord of the Admiralty, Sir James Graham, who relied on him to push through his plans for an amphibious assault on Sevastopol. This he did at a series of allied councils of war in July and August 1854, in opposition to the views of Dundas. Lyons relished his position, and soon began to differ from his admiral, allowing his asides to be recorded by a party from <span class="italic">The Times</span>, including John Delane, Austen Henry Layard, and William Howard Russell, who relayed his views to the public, and cabinet ministers. The correspondence with Graham was improper and indiscreet, and Dundas recognized the want of trust in him it implied.<br>
<br>Lyons, with his white hair and slight physique, always fancied that he resembled Nelson, and consciously attempted to model his conduct accordingly. However, he lacked the sustained intellectual power that was such a feature of Nelson's approach to warfare. Lyons was aggressive, dynamic and forceful, but he did not originate a single major operational or strategic movement, being the executor of other men's plans. Dundas, recognizing his subordinate's talents, delegated to him the organization of the transports for the invasion of the Crimea, and Lyons promptly handed the task on to his flag captain William Mends. Mends's plan proved highly successful, much to Lyons's credit. Lyons quickly struck up a rapport with Lord Raglan which greatly assisted inter-service co-operation in the subsequent campaign. Dundas left inshore operations and liaison to Lyons, remaining afloat with the main fleet.<br>
<br>Lyons captured Balaklava, and advised Lord Raglan to adopt it as the base of the British army, a decision that was to have unfortunate consequences when the army had to winter in the Crimea. Lyons led the inshore squadron in the diversionary attack on Sevastopol on 17 October 1854, and ignoring Dundas's orders closed in to engage the fortifications. While this demonstrated his personal bravery, the ships were damaged and unnecessary casualties were sustained. Afterwards Lyons accepted that Dundas had been correct. The failure of the raid on Sevastopol led the government to seek a scapegoat, and Dundas was chosen. Lyons succeeded to the command in January 1855. Working closely with Lord Raglan he improved supply arrangements in the Bosphorus, where Rear-Admiral Frederick Grey took command, and at Balaklava. His most important contribution to the war lay in securing French consent to the capture of Kerch and occupation of the Sea of Azov in May. This operation, long urged by Graham, destroyed the logistic support of the Russian army in the Crimea, determining the outcome of the campaign. As the direction of the Crimean campaign increasingly fell under French control, reflecting the relative sizes of the two armies, Lyons found that opportunities for wide-ranging operations declined. In June 1855 he suffered a double blow, losing his son, Captain Edmund Lyons RN (1819&#150;1855), who had been severely wounded in a night attack on Sevastopol, and his close friend and colleague Raglan. After the fall of Sevastopol he led an expedition to capture Kinburn on 17 October 1855, an enterprise notable for the first operational use of armoured warships. This opened up the Bug and Dnieper rivers for allied operations. In July 1855 he was nominated a military GCB.<br>
<br>In January 1856 Lyons attended the allied council of war in Paris, where he pressed for a more energetic prosecution of the war. After the treaty of Paris he completed his term as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. He was promoted to the peerage as Baron Lyons of Christchurch on 23 June 1856. On 19 March 1857 he became a vice-admiral, and from December he held the temporary rank of admiral. Already a sick man, Lyons returned to Britain in early 1858 and, after commanding the squadron that escorted the queen to Cherbourg in August, he went ashore. He died on 23 November 1858 at Arundel Castle, the seat of his son-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13916/', "Henry Granville Fitzalan Howard, fourteenth duke of Norfolk")</script>. He was buried in the vault of Arundel Castle. Lyons's elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17292/', "Richard Bickerton Pemell Lyons")</script>, followed his father into the diplomatic service, where he had a distinguished career.<br>
<br>Lyons was distinguished for his bravery, spirit and commitment. His service as a diplomat in the minor European posts was a worthwhile alternative to long periods on half pay, and provided him with skills and insights that he put to good use in the Crimea. Like his inspiration, Nelson, he was as lavish with his praise of others as he was anxious to be praised by his superiors, and his energy and determination earned him the commitment of those under his command. Nevertheless he was limited by his character and intellect. A balanced assessment of him was provided by Lord Clarendon, the foreign secretary, in 1856: &#145;tho' he has some ability &amp; considerable firmness I think him singularly deficient in judgement, he is moreover irritable &amp; one of the vainest men I ever knew&#146;  (Lambert, 329).<br>
<br>Lyons's contribution to the Crimean campaign was immense, from the allied council of war that decided to attempt the operation, through the transport of the British army, the provision of naval support afloat and ashore, providing advice and support for Lord Raglan, and carrying out the critical Kerch operation. Without him the operation might never have been attempted. His enthusiasm, energy, and leadership made him an outstanding fleet commander, but his limited grasp of strategic issues denied him true greatness.<br>
