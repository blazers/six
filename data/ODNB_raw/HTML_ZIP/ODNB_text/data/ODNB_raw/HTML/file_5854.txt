<span class="headword">Cole,  John</span>  (1792&#150;1848), <span class="occ">bookseller and antiquary</span>, was born on 3 October 1792 in Weston Favell, Northamptonshire. He was of unknown parentage, and was apprenticed to William Birdsall, a bookseller in Northampton. In 1809 he began compiling material for a history of Northampton; the work was published by Birdsall (who failed to credit Cole's authorship) in 1815. By this date Cole had also written a history of Ecton (compiled during the winter of 1813&#150;14), which was published in 1825. In 1817 he purchased the stock and goodwill of a bookseller in Lincoln and produced his first catalogue. He married Susannah Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1832), fourth daughter of James Marshall of Northampton, on 26 August 1817. <span class="italic">The History of Lincoln and Guide to its Curiosities and Antiquities</span> appeared in 1818.<br>
<br>After leaving Lincoln, Cole settled in Hull, before moving in 1821 to Scarborough, where he opened a bookshop and circulating library. Cole's most successful publishing activity was in Scarborough. He published over 100 small books on topographical and antiquarian subjects, especially on Northamptonshire and the area surrounding Scarborough. Most of the books were slender, in limited editions of between twenty-five and sixty copies. Joseph Brogden Baker in <span class="italic">The History of Scarborough from the Earliest Date</span> (1882) provided William Bean's recollection of Cole's versatility as a lecturer<blockquote>on astronomy, the anatomy of costume, architecture and natural history. These several subjects are discussed in a scientific and pleasing manner. The drawings are well executed, elegant and appropriate and the specimens in natural history are interesting and costly. Mr Cole's lectures always afforded me the highest gratification.</blockquote>In 1825 Cole won a share of a lottery prize and travelled to London to receive it, and while there he was able to acquire some scarce views of Scarborough by Francis Place. In 1828 he was encouraged to edit a book on household cookery as a result of purchasing a library. &#145;Thus have I quite unexpectedly become the editor of a cookery book, an honour to which I had not thought to aspire&#146;  (J. Cole, preface to <span class="italic">The Oldfieldian Cookery Book</span>, 1828). His one attempt at a periodical in 1824, the <span class="italic">Scarborough Repository</span>, survived for only eight issues. His wife returned to the home of her parents in Northampton, where she died on 30 July 1832. Shortly afterwards, Cole returned to Northampton with his six children. He continued publishing, writing, and lecturing on philosophy and natural history, and in June 1833 organized a commemoration in honour of the Revd James Hervey at Weston Favell, at which he lectured. Following the failure of his bookshop in Northampton's Market Square, he moved to Wellingborough in 1834 where he initially opened a shop selling hams and bacon, and then converted the premises to <blockquote>a small school, and placed geological specimens, &amp;c. [as well as such incongruous wares as apples, bacon, and ham] in his window for sale. He was a quiet man and regarded as very eccentric because he and his sons would go out all day and return laden with wild plants, &amp;c. &hellip; His industrious curiosity was never appreciated in Northamptonshire, where he dragged out a miserable existence. (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>)</blockquote>Cole's <span class="italic">History of Wellingborough</span> was published in 1837 and was followed a year later by the <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Higham Ferrers</span> and his <span class="italic">Annals of Rushden, Irthlingborough and Knuston</span>. He tried his luck as a schoolmaster in Rushden in 1837, after which he taught and lived in Polebrook (from 1840) and took the post of master of the national school at Huntingdon in 1842.<br>
<br>In 1845 Cole opened his last school in Woodford, near Thrapston, Northamptonshire, where he lived in greatly reduced circumstances. &#145;I was informed that he was in great want and distress in the retreat I alluded to&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>). A few titles appeared in his remaining years, including a <span class="italic">Calendar of Every Day Reference for the County of Huntingdon</span> in 1845, but to all intents and purposes his publishing days were over. He moved to The Academy, Club Lane, where he lived until his death on 12 April 1848. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Woodford.<br>
<br>Cole's main achievement is in over 100 publications which contain carefully observed descriptions of village life and houses in both Scarborough and Northamptonshire. His detailed observations are often the only description of buildings which have been demolished, and his accounts of everyday village life provide excellent source material for local historians. His tireless pertinacity in searching out the minutiae of antiquarian detail was recognized, although his publications were criticized for not being very scholarly. His topographical works are collectors' items and much sought after because of their limited editions. However, his work was repetitive, and varied in quality. He was clearly industrious and enthusiastic in his antiquarian research but he lacked business acumen and was unsuited to running a bookshop.<br>
