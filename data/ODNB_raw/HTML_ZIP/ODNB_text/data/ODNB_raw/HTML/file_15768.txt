<span class="headword">Knowles,  Herbert</span>  (1798&#150;1817), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Gomersal, near Leeds, Yorkshire. His parentage is said to have been very humble, but it is also stated that he was the brother of J. C. Knowles, subsequently QC. He was early orphaned and was about to enter a merchant's office at Liverpool when his talents came to the notice of three benevolent clergymen, who raised &pound;20 a year towards his education on the condition that his friends contributed another &pound;30, and sent him to Richmond grammar school, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Lacking funds to obtain a sizarship at St John's College, Cambridge, Knowles wrote to Southey, sending him the poem entitled &#145;The Three Tabernacles&#146;, better known as &#145;Stanzas in Richmond Churchyard&#146;, which he had composed on 7 October 1816. Southey, with his usual generosity, promised &pound;10 a year, and obtained a further &pound;20 from Earl Spencer and Samuel Rogers. Knowles's letter to Southey, dated 28 December 1816, shows his modesty, candour, and good sense. He puts aside excessive expectations, but undertakes to &#145;strive that my passage through the university, if not splendid, shall be respectable&#146;. His verses were printed in the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> for 1819 and 1824, and the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span> for 1825 (reprinted in the <span class="italic">Saturday Magazine</span>, vol. 16); and a correspondent of <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> possessed several unpublished pieces.<br>
<br>Knowles was elected a sizar on 31 January 1817, but was already fatally ill, and died on 17 February 1817 at Gomersal. His precocious talents and early death invite the inevitable comparison with Chatterton.<br>
