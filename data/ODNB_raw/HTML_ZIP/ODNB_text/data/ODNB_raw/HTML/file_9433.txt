<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finch,  Heneage</span>, first earl of Nottingham  (1621&#150;1682), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, born on 23 December 1621, probably at Eastwell, Kent, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9432/', "Sir Heneage Finch (1580&#150;1631)")</script>, recorder of London and speaker of the House of Commons in 1626, and Frances (<i>d</i>. 1627), daughter of Sir Edmund Bell, of Beaupr&eacute; Hall, Outwell, Norfolk. Finch came of an old Kentish family from which had come many persons prominent in the legal profession. His great-uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9436/', "Sir Henry Finch")</script>, serjeant-at-law and legal author, whose son, Heneage's cousin, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9438/', "John Finch, Baron Finch of Fordwich")</script>, who had held the great seal prior to the civil war. Heneage's father died when his son was under ten years of age, but this did not hinder his early career. After Westminster School he was at Christ Church, Oxford, from 1635, was then admitted to the Inner Temple, on 26 November 1638, and was called to the bar in 1645. For the next fifteen years he was in private practice and acquired a high reputation as lawyer and advocate, but being a convinced royalist he abstained during the Commonwealth from taking any part in public affairs. In 1646 he married Elizabeth Harvey (1627&#150;1676), daughter of Daniel Harvey, a Levant merchant of London, and kinswoman of the physician William Harvey. They had fourteen children, some of whom had distinguished careers: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9427/', "Daniel Finch")</script>, their eldest son, held high office under the later Stuarts; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9435/', "Heneage Finch")</script>, their second son, became solicitor-general and was created earl of Aylesford; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9429/', "Edward Finch")</script> was a clergyman and musician. The family lived in Kensington House, later sold by Daniel to William III.<br>
<br>The Restoration of 1660 was a tide of good fortune for Heneage Finch. He became solicitor-general on 7 June (and acquired a baronetcy the same day, probably procured by his kinsman, the earl of Winchilsea). He was elected member of the Convention Parliament for Canterbury, and since the attorney-general, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, was not a member of the House of Commons this cast on Finch much of the management of legal business in parliament for the next dozen years. In the legal profession he became treasurer of his inn of court in 1661, and the king was present at his reader's feast.<br>
<br>Having entered the Convention Parliament as member for Canterbury, Finch was immediately active in the promotion of the restoration of the monarchy and established church. He was chairman of the committee to consider the <span class="roman">Bill of Indemnity</span> and of the committee which made exceptions from the amnesty. In the election of 1661 he was returned with Laurence Hyde as member for Oxford University, and kept this seat until his removal to the House of Lords. As solicitor-general he prosecuted the regicides. Finch was particularly vigorous in the re-establishment of the church and was generally opposed to the toleration of dissenters; in February 1663 he chaired the committee which drew up the address requesting the withdrawal of the declaration of indulgence, though in February 1673 he did concede in the debate on the declaration of 1672 the prerogative of dispensation. His concerns with church and state did not exhaust his political interests. Thus he was extremely active in the vexed question of the Irish cattle trade and made numerous speeches against the protectionist bills (<span class="roman">Cattle Acts</span> of 1663 and 1667) since they sought to prevent the king from exercising his dispensing power to exempt individuals from the operation of the legislation. The strain of this work caused him to collapse with nervous exhaustion. Towards the end of the Cavalier Parliament his activities had somewhat declined, but it has been computed that in that parliament he had served on 245 committees and had made 47 reports, and that since 1666 (when regular reporting of debates began) he had made about 130 speeches.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most difficult of his political positions was that brought about by the impeachment of Clarendon in 1667. To Clarendon he owed his parliamentary seat and he was doubtless resentful of being drawn in to the proceedings against the fallen minister. He did attempt to restrain the fury of the impeachment, though he had to concede that his speech on that occasion was capable of a double interpretation; in the event the crisis was resolved by Clarendon's flight and banishment. In February 1668 he was able to defeat Temple's bill for triennial parliaments, as he had earlier been instrumental in securing in 1664 the repeal of the 1641 act on the subject. In the same month he appeared as counsel to defeat the attempt to confer original instance jurisdiction in civil cases on the House of Lords in the case of Skinner and the East India Company, and after the House of Commons had voted that such proceedings were illegal, the Lords abandoned their claim to hear such cases. Finch was also hostile to the appellate powers of the Lords, but though he was successful in this regard as to ecclesiastical appeals, the House of Lords did establish its right over chancery appeals. In December 1668 he opposed the impeachment of Lord Orrery, saying &#145;No man knows, when a spirit of accusation is up, when it will rest again, and he never knew much good done in Parliaments where many impeachments were&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 2.320). In 1670 Finch became attorney-general in succession to Sir Geoffrey Palmer, but his parliamentary activity continued unabated, particularly in the management of money bills and the dispute with the Lords in 1671 over the practice of tacking. The House of Commons voted him their thanks for maintaining their monopoly over supply. In 1673 he was much involved in the controversy over the king's declaration of indulgence, in which debate he defended the prerogative of dispensation, though ultimately advising a petition that the declaration be withdrawn and chairing a committee formed for the purpose. He resisted a bill for the naturalization of protestant immigrants, though generally favouring a bill of ease for protestant dissenters. His Commons career terminated abruptly when on the dismissal of Shaftesbury as lord chancellor he was made lord keeper on 9 November 1673. The following January he received a peerage as Baron Finch of Daventry. He was appointed lord chancellor in 1675.<br>
<br>While in the House of Lords, Finch was less involved in controversial politics, though with rising faction he could not avoid such conflicts altogether. On the issue of exclusion of the duke of York from succession he favoured rather a scheme of limitation, though he argued at length in council against the dissolution of the first Exclusion Parliament. He was dangerously exposed to faction politics for his role in the projected impeachment of his old Commons colleague, the earl of Danby, who was sent to the Tower in 1679. Finch was appointed high steward to preside over the impending impeachment, but the distasteful duty was avoided by an arrangement whereby the great seal was temporarily placed in the king's hands and Danby's pardon sealed by an under-officer. A committee of the House of Commons seems to have accepted Finch's explanation for this technical evasion of responsibility. (As a result of this episode he composed a learned treatise on the royal prerogative of pardon, especially in relation to impeachments.) Some trials over which he did preside as high steward were of ordinary crime, as that in 1678 of the earl of Pembroke for a duelling manslaughter.<br>
<br>A more serious political event was the impeachment for high treason of Lord Stafford in 1680. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen wrote of this trial:<blockquote>I do not think that even in our own times a prisoner could be treated with greater tenderness, consideration and courtesy &hellip; yet this most courteous and humane proceeding ended in what I think must be regarded as by far the most inexcusable of all the verdicts given in connection with the Popish plot. (Stephen, 1.396)</blockquote>Finch voted as high steward with the majority for conviction (fifty-five votes to thirty-one, so the peers were not a panic-stricken jury), but it does appear from his speech upon judgment that he was a believer in the plot at large. (Among his private papers there is an elaborate analysis of the general evidences for and against the plot; he seems to have relied too far on the dangerous maxim that there is no smoke without fire.) Nevertheless his speech on this melancholy occasion was generally regarded as one of his best public utterances. The final episode of his political career was the dramatic dissolution of the Oxford Parliament in March 1681. During that very brief parliament he had become involved with the attempt by the House of Commons to impeach Edward Fitzharris for high treason. Under his advice the House of Lords decided that they could not receive the impeachment of a commoner on a capital charge. This raised a storm in the House of Commons, but the dissolution two days later blew the whigs away. Finch did not meet another parliament; created earl of Nottingham on 12 May 1681, he was now increasingly affected by ill health, and he confined his remaining energies to his chancery work, up to his death on 18 December 1682. He was buried at All Saints' Church, Ravenstone, Buckinghamshire. His son Daniel succeeded him as second earl.<br>
<br>Finch was not at home in the world of party politics nor was he a maker of political policy. It has been said of him that &#145;during 22 years of continuous ministerial office it is hard to trace any serious deviation from his principles of loyalty to the Church and respect for the prerogative&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 2.322). For the long-term effects of his public career his judicial work as lord chancellor was of much further consequence. As Holdsworth has remarked, &#145;it is his work as a great equity judge that has given him his distinguished position in our legal history&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 6.541). The development of equity as administered in the court of chancery was by the seventeenth century moving towards a regular system of principles and rules designed to supplement the common law by emphasizing requirements of honesty and good faith in legal transactions and relations. Finch began the task of organizing and systematizing these principles; he was particularly concerned to rationalize with a view to the future. Numerous instances of this pervade the law of trusts, mortgages, and contracts, and when legislative assistance was required, he managed that, for example, in organizing the content and carriage of the <span class="roman">Statute of Frauds</span> in 1677. Perhaps his best-known decision was that in the <i>Duke of Norfolk's case</i> (1681) in which he cut through a mass of confused and confusing precedents to originate the basis of a general rule against perpetuities in trust settlements, and enunciated a principle limiting an owner's power to create future interests in trust property by the imposition of the &#145;dead man's hand&#146;.<br>
<br>Apart from some scattered contemporary reports Finch's work was not published until a collection entitled <span class="italic">Reports of cases decreed in the high court of chancery during the time Sir Heneage Finch, afterwards earl of Nottingham, was lord chancellor</span> was made by William Nelson in 1725. But these cases were drawn from the books of decretal orders and thus do not supply the judicial reasons for the decisions. But Lord Nottingham had fortunately penned his own private collection of his cases which circulated in manuscript in the eighteenth century and some few selected cases were published in Swanston's <span class="italic">Chancery Reports</span> (1821&#150;7). The full publication of Nottingham's reports was not achieved until they were edited and published by the Selden Society in two volumes (73, 79) in 1957 and 1961, and other treatises by him on chancery law and practice were during this period edited and printed after long obscurity. Nevertheless his status as the &#145;Father of Modern Equity&#146; was recognized in the legal profession long before modern academic retrieval of the texts. Thus Blackstone wrote that he &#145;was endued with a pervading genius, that enabled him to discover and pursue the true spirit of justice&#146; and that he was enabled &#145;in the course of nine years to build a system of jurisprudence upon wide and rational foundations&#146;  (Blackstone, 3.55).<br>
