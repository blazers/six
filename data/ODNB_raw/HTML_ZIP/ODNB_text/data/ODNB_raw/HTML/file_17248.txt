<span class="headword">Lyle,  David</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1755&#150;1762), <span class="occ">maker of mathematical instruments and stenographer</span>, was the author of a treatise entitled <span class="italic">The art of short hand improved, being an universal character adapted to the English language, whereby every kind of subject may be expressed or taken down in a very easy, compendious, and legible manner</span> (1762). He describes himself on the title-page as a master of arts, having graduated at Glasgow in 1755. Nothing is known of the circumstances of his birth, or of his death.<br>
<br>In the dedication of the work to the earl of Bute, Lyle states that it was by his lordship's good offices that he was enabled to bring his new mathematical instruments to great perfection, and that, at his desire, he had completed a set of them for the king. This set comprises four silver volute compasses, now in the King George III collection in the Science Museum, London, all similar in design and, according to the inscription on the largest and most complex, made in 1760. The compasses were designed to draw spirals of different types according to a changeable drum attached to the instrument. Few examples of this style of compass survive because they were not widely used owing to their limited field of application and the difficulty in manipulating them, and Lyle's has been described as one of the less successful bids to gain royal patronage. Other instruments by him are not known, and none was in the large collection of his patron, the earl of Bute, when it was sold in 1793.<br>
<br>The introduction to Lyle's method of stenography, which he calls the other production of his younger days, contains a detailed essay on the theory of the art and criticism of the systems of Weston, Macaulay, and Annet. He was not successful, however, in reducing his theory to practice, for although his beautifully engraved tables of words and sentences are elegant and concise, a close examination reveals that their shortness is produced, in the majority of instances, by omitting words or syllables necessary to the sense. His vowel scheme, on a phonetic basis, was more extensive than any previously attempted, but the merits of the system are purely theoretical.<br>
