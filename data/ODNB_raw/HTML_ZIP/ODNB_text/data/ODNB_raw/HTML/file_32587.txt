<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Courtauld,  Samuel</span>  (1876&#150;1947), <span class="occ">industrialist and patron of the arts</span>, was born at Bocking, Essex, on 7 May 1876, the second son of Sydney Courtauld, a silk manufacturer, and his wife, Sarah Lucy, the daughter of William Sharp. The Courtaulds had arrived in England as Huguenot refugees at the end of the seventeenth century. Three generations of the family worked as London silversmiths. The silk firm was effectively founded in 1816 by Sydney's uncle, Samuel Courtauld (1793&#150;1881). Samuel, the great-nephew of the founder, followed precedent and in 1898 joined the company. He had meanwhile been educated at Rugby School (1890&#150;94) and was then sent to Krefeld and Lyons to learn the techniques of textile manufacture. In 1901&#151;the year in which, on 20 June, he married Elizabeth Theresa Frances (<i>d</i>. 1931), the only daughter of Edward Kelsey&#151;he became manager of the company's weaving mill at Halstead, and in 1908 he was appointed general manager of all the firm's textile mills. This promotion was not mere nepotism. He was the only member of the family in the business to have earned the approbation of H. G. Tetley, an outsider to the family but then the dominant power in the company and the architect of its move from silk into rayon. Courtauld, who proved himself an able and vigorous manager, joined the board of Courtaulds Ltd in 1915 and succeeded Tetley as joint managing director in 1917, when Tetley became chairman. On Tetley's death in 1921 the way was open for Courtauld to succeed as chairman of what had become a &pound;12 million international concern. For the next quarter of a century he filled two roles in British public life: he was chairman of what was for most of that time the world's largest firm of rayon manufacturers, and he was one of Britain's best-known patrons of the arts.<br>
<br>The highly profitable company which Courtauld took over was just beginning to face competition as a big rayon boom got under way. His response to that boom exhibited certain central facets of his character. Clear, knowledgeable, and authoritative in his statements, he strove for conciliation and compromise, limits on competition, and ordered growth. Bold, aggressive, and risky business ventures of the sort which his great-uncle or Tetley had pursued were anathema to him. Many of the new rayon companies founded in the 1920s came crashing down in the 1930s depression. In 1931 Courtauld voiced his disapproval of what he called &#145;the senseless increase in production resulting from the orgy of company-promoting and speculation&#146; and observed loftily that it was &#145;a discreditable chapter in industrial history&#146;  (Coleman, 2.219). Under his leadership the company which bore his family name became a highly respected industrial giant, a blue-chip security. It pursued a policy of financial conservatism, with large reserves and a cautious dividend policy.<br>
<br>Courtauld's own lengthy and forthright speeches at annual general meetings were something of an event in the business calendar. He became a public figure, yet he characteristically turned down the offer of a barony in 1937. His ideas on a variety of subjects were disseminated in numerous letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and, especially during the Second World War, by sundry pronouncements on industry and the state and on capital&#150;labour relations. He sat on numerous committees concerned with such issues and was a visiting fellow and trustee of Nuffield College, Oxford. Some of his views&#151;for example, his dislike of advertising and his advocacy of more government control of the economy and of a more sympathetic regard for the claims of labour to a share in management&#151;did not go down well with some of his fellow businessmen. His dignified and respected leadership had costs as well as benefits for the company. It became complacent. Not until the end of 1938 did Courtauld tell his colleagues on the board that it had rested too much on its laurels, neglecting research. There was also a failure to understand the need for changes in organization, management, and personnel as the firm expanded. Too much power was left in the hands of unimaginative bosses whose rough and ready methods had worked in the past but who remained contemptuous of change. Again, it was not until the later 1930s, and then after the Second World War, that many necessary changes were brought about.<br>
<br>The fact that Courtauld was in many ways the antithesis of the adventurous entrepreneur owed much to his serious-minded upbringing. His parents retained longer than others of their generation a profound regard for the family Unitarianism. He inherited from his father both an interest in the technical side of the business and a regard for music; from his mother came an appreciation of art and literature. The latter found its outlet in his picture collecting and in his acquaintanceship with many prominent figures of the literary and artistic world, such as the Sitwells, Roger Fry, and Charles Morgan, as well as with Lydia Lopokova and John Maynard Keynes, who provided links between Bloomsbury and business. His collecting started before he became a very rich man and showed an adventurousness not evident in his business career, for it resulted in the building up of what became the finest collection of French Impressionist paintings in the country. It contained many works by Degas, Renoir, Manet (including the famous <span class="italic">Bar at the Folies-Berg&egrave;re</span>, for which he paid some &pound;23,000 in 1926), Seurat, and especially C&eacute;zanne, whose cause he particularly championed. By far the greater part of the collecting was done in the 1920s; it virtually ended with the death of his wife on 25 December 1931. In 1923 he had given &pound;50,000 to the Tate Gallery for the purchase of similar works.<br>
<br>On his wife's death Courtauld established and handsomely endowed the Courtauld Institute of Art in the University of London (which conferred on him an honorary DLitt), providing the new institute with the lease of his splendid Adam house, Home House, in Portman Square, and a substantial part of his own collection. He had strong emotional reactions to what these paintings revealed to him; and a sense of duty to make available to the public the civilizing influence of art. He was a trustee of the Tate Gallery from 1927 to 1937 and of the National Gallery from 1931 to 1947. He and his wife also gave financial support to music and concert-going in London. In the 1930s he became much enamoured of Christabel, Lady Aberconway; and his self-doubt and private quest for truth and beauty can be seen in many letters to her, letters often charged with a rather heavy sententiousness. It is perhaps hardly surprising that Edith Sitwell should have recorded, after conversation at a lunch party, that he made her feel &#145;unpardonably flippant&#146;  (Glendinning, 172).<br>
<br>In May 1946 Courtauld suffered a severe illness and in October resigned from the chairmanship. He remained on the board, but died on 1 December 1947, at his home, 12 North Audley Street, London. His will was proved at &pound;1,030,126. After various legacies much of his property went to his only daughter, Sydney Elizabeth, and to her husband, Richard Austen Butler (later Lord Butler of Saffron Walden), whom she had married in 1926.<br>
