<span class="headword">Evans,  Arthur Benoni</span>  (1781&#150;1854), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Compton-Beauchamp, Berkshire, on 25 March 1781, son of the Revd Lewis Evans (1755&#150;1827) of Basaleg, Monmouthshire, vicar of Froxfield, Wiltshire, and his wife, Ann, eldest daughter of Thomas Norman. Lewis Evans was a well-known astronomer, and held for many years the professorship of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Arthur Evans was educated at the college school, Gloucester, of which his uncle and namesake was headmaster; his courageous character earned him the nickname the Bold Arthur. He went up to St John's College, Oxford, in October 1800, and graduated BA on 21 February 1804, MA in 1820, and BD and DD in 1828. In addition to Greek and Latin, he learned Hebrew, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Icelandic. His other interests included music&#151;he played several instruments&#151;and art; he sketched in pencil, crayon, and sepia. He also studied geology and botany, and his knowledge of Greek, Roman, and English coins, of which he had a large collection, was considerable.<br>
<br>Evans was ordained to the curacy of Hartpury, Gloucester, in August 1804, and after receiving priest's orders in September 1805 was in the following month appointed professor of classics and history in the Royal Military College, then just established at Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire. He moved with the college to Sandhurst in October 1812. In June 1819 he married Anne (1791&#150;1883), third daughter of Captain Thomas Dickinson RN of Bramblebury, near Woolwich, with whom he had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Evans resigned his chair at the Royal Military College in 1822, and went to Britwell, near Burnham, where he prepared pupils for the universities and served the curacy of Burnham until 1829. In that year he accepted the headmastership of the free grammar school at Market Bosworth, Leicestershire. He also held successively the curacies of Bosworth, Carlton, and Cadeby between 1829 and 1841. Clerical appointments never brought Evans more than &pound;100 a year, but as a schoolmaster he was very successful and prosperous. His publications included sermons, poems, and pastoral and polemical works, as well as <span class="italic">Leicestershire Words, Phrases, and Proverbs</span> (1848), which was reprinted by the English Dialect Society in 1881. He died at the free grammar school, Market Bosworth, on 8 November 1854.<br>
<br>One of Evans's sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33040/', "John Evans (1823&#150;1908)")</script>, became a leading archaeologist and numismatist, serving as treasurer of the Royal Society (1878&#150;98) and president of the Society of Antiquaries (1885&#150;92). Another, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33044/', "Sebastian Evans")</script>, was a designer for glass work and a poet; he also edited the <span class="italic">Birmingham Daily Gazette</span> from 1867 to 1870, and was for some time the editor of <span class="italic">The People</span>, a Conservative Sunday journal. Evans's daughter, <a name="cosubject_8940"></a><span class="headword">Anne Evans</span>  (1820&#150;1870), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 4 June 1820, probably at Britwell Court, near Burnham. She never married, and after the death of her father she moved to Kensington. Her health broke down in 1867, and she was an invalid until her death on 19 February 1870. Anne Evans wrote poetry and music, which were edited and published with a memoir after her death by Anne Thackeray Ritchie (1880). Lady Ritchie described her as a &#145;diffident woman, who &hellip; unconsciously touched and influenced us all by her intense sincerity of heart and purpose&#146;  (Ritchie, viii).<br>
