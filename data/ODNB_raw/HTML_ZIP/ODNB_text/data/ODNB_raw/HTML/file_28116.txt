<span class="headword">Varley,  John</span>  (1778&#150;1842), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and art teacher</span>, was born on 17 August 1778 in a converted inn, the Blue Post, Mare Street, Hackney, Middlesex. He was the eldest of five children of Richard Varley (<i>d</i>. 1791) of Epworth, Lincolnshire, and his second wife, Hannah Fleetwood. By family tradition his mother was descended from Oliver Cromwell's daughter Bridget. Richard Varley's profession is unknown, but his brother Samuel Varley was a manufacturer of scientific instruments. In spite of parental disapproval, Richard Varley's three sons, John Varley, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28113/', "Cornelius Varley (1781&#150;1873)")</script>, and <a href="#cosubject_28116">William Fleetwood Varley [<i>see below</i>]</a>, became artists, as did his daughter Elizabeth, who married the painter William Mulready.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer17911805"></a>Early career, 1791&#150;1805</h2>At the age of thirteen John Varley was apprenticed to a silversmith, but his father's death in 1791 left the family in poverty, and forced a move to lodgings opposite St Luke's Hospital in Old Street, Hoxton. Varley was next placed with a law stationer but his heart was in sketching and his mother was persuaded to support him. After a brief time with a portrait painter in Holborn, at fifteen or sixteen he became a pupil and assistant to Joseph Charles Barrow, who held an evening drawing school at 12 Furnival's Inn Court, Holborn; Fran&ccedil;ois Louis Francia was his fellow assistant. In 1796, while out sketching, Varley made the acquaintance of John Preston Neale. The two men formed a lasting friendship and frequently &#145;sallied forth in search of the picturesque&#146;  (Roget, 1.169) in the villages around north-east London. Barrow took him on a sketching tour to Peterborough and in 1798 Varley exhibited a drawing of Peterborough Cathedral at the Royal Academy, before becoming a regular exhibitor there until 1804.<br>
<br>Varley's first tour to Wales in 1798 or 1799 laid the foundation of his art, providing him with inspiration and subject matter for the rest of his life. At this time Varley became acquainted with Dr Thomas Monro, taking part in the drawing sessions at the &#145;Monro academy&#146; in the Adelphi Terrace from 1800 and visiting Monro at his country home, Fetcham Cottage, near Leatherhead. On Monro's advice Varley left Hoxton and moved to the West End, to live first with his brother Cornelius in Charles Street, Covent Garden, and then from 1801 at 2 Harris Place, Pantheon, Oxford Street. It was at this time that he is first recorded taking pupils. In 1802 he visited north Wales again and also became a member of the Sketching Society, chaired by John Sell Cotman, to draw subjects of literary inspiration. His marriage to Esther Gisborne (<i>d</i>. 1824) in the following year produced five sons and three daughters but was not, according to the painter John Linnell and other friends, a happy one. Linnell provides a picture of Varley's heavy build and imposing physique, describing him as &#145;bull like in strength and figure&#146;. Varley was a keen pugilist, though his skill was said to be marred by his ungainliness. He was also &#145;a man of the most generous impulses &hellip; but deficient in sagacity and most easily imposed upon by the crafty&#146;  (Linnell, autobiography, 10).<br>
<br>Varley's early work may be divided into three groups: topographical views of English and Welsh towns, Welsh landscapes, and more informal studies from nature. The topographical views, mostly of Hereford (many in Hereford Art Gallery), Leominster, Chester, and Conwy (examples in the V&amp;A), tend to conform to a pattern of rows of houses on a central receding street, reminiscent of the work of Thomas Hearne, with the addition of the picturesque irregularity of half-timbered houses, peeling paintwork, and crumbling masonry. The second group, of Welsh mountain views, form the bulk of his output throughout his career, though it is the earlier examples that most convincingly portray the awe-inspiring character of mountain scenery. Both in technique and composition they owe a prime debt to Thomas Girtin, and ultimately to Richard Wilson, whose <span class="italic">Snowdon from Llyn Nantle</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) was the progenitor of such Welsh views. These early watercolours are more naturalistic than later examples, with the views represented showing a regard for topographical accuracy. Nevertheless, Varley followed William Gilpin's advice in adapting nature to the requirements of composition. Distant mountains, for example, are brought nearer the picture plane to form a focal point. Indeed, as early as 1804, in his views of Bala Lake and Moel Hebog (V&amp;A), the tonality follows in detail the rules Varley published later in his own <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Principles of Landscape Design</span> of 1816&#150;17: shadow in the foreground, succeeded by a mass of light contrasting with a middle tone in the further distance. In selecting his viewpoints Varley, like his contemporaries, followed the numerous pictorial models which had been called into being by the rapid increase of tourism and travel books in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>The third category of Varley's early watercolours were informal studies of the English landscape, several of them inscribed with the rubric &#145;Studies from nature&#146;. They were usually panoramic views clearly based on direct observation but with the addition of the Claudean framing device of trees if the composition demanded, for example <span class="italic">Polesden</span> (1800; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne). At this time Varley developed his landscape compositions to produce works dominated by unbroken, unmodulated layers of wash with sharply defined edges, for example <span class="italic">Harlech Castle and Tygwyn Ferry</span> (1804; Yale U. CBA), which are closely comparable to Cotman's work of the same period.<h2>
<a name="Yearsofsuccess18051812teacherandastrologer"></a>Years of success, 1805&#150;1812: teacher and astrologer</h2>Varley played a prominent role in the establishment of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96320', "Society of Painters in Water Colours")</script> in November 1804, which marked a significant rise in the status of that art form. He took a leading part in the society's early years and enjoyed a considerable personal success at its exhibitions. To the first, in 1805, he contributed forty-two watercolours out of a total of 275, of which thirty were sold for a total of &pound;139 13<i>s</i>. He continued to be the society's most prolific exhibitor, with an average of forty-four works in the exhibitions between 1805 and 1812. His ability to produce numerous fresh drawings for an opening earned them the sobriquet of &#145;Varley's hot rolls&#146;. His principal buyers were members of the aristocracy and landed gentry: Sir Henry Englefield, Lord Essex, Thomas Hope, Lord Ossulston, William Ord, Sir John Swinburne, Walter Fawkes, and Edward Lascelles, later earl of Harewood.<br>
<br>Varley was equally well known as a teacher of both professional artists and well-born amateurs. By about 1805&#150;6 many of the rising generation of artists were his pupils. Mulready, Linnell, W. H. Hunt, William Turner of Oxford, and Copley Fielding, all in their teens, lived at his house for a sum of about &pound;100 a year. David Cox and Peter DeWint, both in their early twenties, also took some lessons at this period. Varley was a firm believer in principles of composition which he published in very dogmatic terms. Paradoxically, however, he was praised by contemporaries for encouraging his pupils to draw from nature and offering only the most general supervision. According to Linnell, &#145;Copying drawings formed no part of the pupils' employment; they were constantly drawing from nature or trying to compose&#146;  (Linnell, autobiography, 7), and it is from the evidence of his pupils more than from his own work that Varley has been accorded recognition as a father figure of <i>plein-air</i> painting in early nineteenth-century Britain. Yet it was as a teacher of well-born ladies at a guinea an hour that Varley enhanced his earnings and cemented his relationship with his patrons, and it was here that he applied his principles of composition which his pupils imbibed by copying his drawings.<br>
<br>One of Varley's pupils, Elizabeth Turner, daughter of the Yarmouth banker Dawson Turner, who took lessons from him in 1822, described another aspect of his character: &#145;With all his nobility of mind he unites a more childish simplicity and credulity, and he entirely believes in astrology, palmistry, raising of ghosts and seeing of visions&#146;  (Kauffmann, 39). Astrology, in which Varley fervently believed, had long ceased to command respect in such sophisticated circles. Nevertheless, there were many who admired his prognostications, of which there are countless stories, not least that he foretold the fire that burnt down his house in 1825. It was his belief in visions that cemented his friendship with William Blake, whom he encouraged to envision and draw portraits of historical and imaginary figures during their evening sessions at Varley's house in Great Titchfield Street between 1819 and 1825. Many of Blake's figures were drawn into two of Varley's sketchbooks. Varley also shared Blake's interest in J. C. Lavater's theories of physiognomy, which sought to demonstrate that a man's innate qualities determine his outward appearance. In his own <span class="italic">Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy</span>, of which the first and only part was published in 1828, Varley located the mainspring of human physiognomy in the basic astrological belief that the influence of the heavens at the moment of birth accounts for the differing physical characteristics, abilities, and temperaments of mankind. However, apart from the profile heads which illustrate the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> (preparatory drawings in the Tate collection), there is no discernible influence of his astrological interest on his work as a painter.<br>
<br>In 1808 Varley made a tour of Northumberland, sketching the coastal castles, and henceforth Northumberland, like Wales, provided a reservoir of motifs and locations upon which he drew for the rest of his career. His work continued to be dominated by a simple flat wash style until about 1812, when he introduced more strictly classical motifs derived from seventeenth-century epic and pastoral landscape, for example, <span class="italic">Suburbs of an Ancient City</span> (1808; Tate collection).<h2>
<a name="Teachingmanualsleanyearsandrevival18131842"></a>Teaching manuals, lean years and revival, 1813&#150;1842</h2>In 1812 declining sales, owing partly to monotony of output, forced the Society of Painters in Water Colours to admit oil painters, and from 1813&#150;1820 its name was changed to the Society of Painters in Oil and Water Colours. In the years 1816&#150;21 the average number of works Varley exhibited dwindled to a mere eight; this decline in exhibited work mirrors a general reduction in his output. However, his name was kept before the public's eye with the publication of his <span class="italic">Treatise on the Principles of Landscape Design</span> in 1816&#150;17. This was in the tradition of illustrated teaching manuals which had proliferated since the 1790s. The works of Claude and Gaspard Poussin served as his main models, and were combined with picturesque theories of variety and intricacy. The basic theme of the <span class="italic">Treatise</span>, that &#145;emphasis must always be on the principal subject&#146;, also appears in several other such manuals, but Varley's publication is distinguished by its extreme formalism. His other publications in this field include <span class="italic">Treatise on the Art of Drawing in Perspective</span> (1815&#150;20), and three shorter manuals: <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on the Art of Drawing</span> (<i>c</i>.1815&#150;20), <span class="italic">Precepts of Landscape Drawing</span> (<i>c</i>.1818), and <span class="italic">Studies of Trees</span> (1818&#150;19), as well as the more interesting <span class="italic">John Varley's List of Colours</span> (1816), which gives nineteen colour samples, with brief advice on their use.<br>
<br>At this time Varley produced formulaic paintings by applying Claudean compositional arrangements to Welsh scenery, as for example in <span class="italic">Landscape with Harlech Castle</span> of <i>c</i>.1815&#150;25 (V&amp;A) and also, in strong contrast, several of his more direct, informal views of the Thames at Millbank and Lambeth (<span class="italic">Millbank Penitentiary</span>, 1816; Museum of London). Thames views had formed part of his repertory since 1806, but these sketches of Millbank, several inscribed &#145;study from nature&#146;, are less finished and lighter in tonality than his more formal compositions of the villages of Chiswick and Chelsea. In the 1820s he tried to fall in with the prevailing taste for works of moral or literary content, exhibiting illustrations to the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, or to Milton, Byron, and Scott at the Society of Painters, but such subjects remain relatively rare in his <i>&#339;uvre</i>.<br>
<br>These were lean years for Varley, with eight children to support, few watercolours to exhibit, and little financial sense. From 1819 Linnell was inundated with requests for loans and in 1820 Varley was declared bankrupt and gaoled. Indeed, although there was a temporary revival in the number of works he exhibited at the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1823&#150;6, and also a display of his work at his house in Great Titchfield Street, Varley appears to have remained insolvent throughout the 1820s and early 1830s. His wife, Esther, died in 1824 and he married Delvalle (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1800), daughter of his friend the engraver Wilson Lowry, in the following year; this union proved to be happier and produced two more children. With the increasing importance of middle-class patronage during the 1830s dealers began to compete with the annual exhibitions for sales of works; in commercial dealings Varley depended first on Samuel Woodburn and then on William Vokins, who became a personal friend.<br>
<br>The last years of his life saw a revival of Varley's fortunes based on a complete change of style. From the later 1830s he moved away from topographical subjects to concentrate on imaginary landscape compositions. Many of these were small, postcard-size sketches characterized by bold, rapid brushstrokes in dark brown wash. A more fundamental change of palette, inspired by the glowing, mystical landscapes of Samuel Palmer, followed in 1839&#150;40. The sketchy brown wash technique was amplified by the introduction of dark red and purple colours and the use of coarse wove paper. In the final phase, 1841&#150;2, he extended the use of hot tonalities with contrasting pink, purple, and orange areas and experimented with an increasing use of gum. These late works have an expressive intensity not seen in Varley's art since his early years, and in 1841 he once again exhibited thirty watercolours and sold twenty-four. Sadly, this revival of fortunes came too late to save him from the financial difficulties that had dogged him, and he died on 17 November 1842 at the house of William Vokins, 5 John Street, Oxford Street, London. His second wife survived him.<br>
<br>Varley's reputation was summarized in his obituaries and in the early histories (Redgrave and Redgrave, 201; Kauffmann, 65). He was accorded the recognition due to one of the leading watercolourists of his day, but there was also an awareness of the monotony of his vast output. In his best work he rivals Girtin and Cotman, but he exhibited over 700 watercolours at the watercolour societies, a relatively small proportion of his total output (there are also a few oils), and his reputation never survived the ensuing glut of his work.<h2>
<a name="Varleysfamily"></a>Varley's family</h2>
<a name="cosubject_28116"></a><span class="headword">William Fleetwood Varley</span>  (1785&#150;1856)<span class="occ"></span> appears to have been taught by his brother John, with whom he was still living at 2 Harris Place, Oxford Street, London, in 1804. His watercolours, of which fifteen are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, reflect different aspects of John's style. He lived in London and exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1804 and 1818, but his principal reputation was as a drawing master in Cornwall, Bath, and Oxford. A brief publication, <span class="italic">A Few Observations on Art</span> (1816), was followed by his fuller treatise <span class="italic">Observations on Colouring and Sketching from Nature</span> (1820), a teaching manual of more practical use than many of its peers. While living in Oxford he was nearly burnt to death in a fire caused by undergraduates, an event from which he never fully recovered, and after which he apparently gave up working. This must have been after 1825, the date of his latest watercolour in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He died in Ramsgate in 1856.<br>
<br>Of John Varley's ten children, two became professional painters: Albert Fleetwood (1804&#150;1876) and Charles Smith (1811&#150;1887). <a name="cosubject_75635"></a><span class="headword">John Varley</span>  (1850&#150;1933)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Albert Fleetwood and his wife, Caroline Roper, was born on 26 January 1850, at New Road, Fulham, London. He achieved a considerable reputation for his views, in watercolour and oil, of Egypt, particularly street scenes of Cairo, and views of the Nile, and also of India and Japan, France and Italy, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1876 and 1895, and which were the subject of one-person shows in London in 1904 and 1913. Like his grandfather, he was interested in astrology and the occult. He and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pollexfen, aunt of the poet W. B. Yeats, whom he married in 1876, were drawn to theosophy and were members of the inner circle gathered round Madame Blavatsky in 1883&#150;4. He died of cancer at the Imperial Nursing Home, Montpellier Parade, Cheltenham, on 20 May 1933, leaving at least one daughter.<br>
