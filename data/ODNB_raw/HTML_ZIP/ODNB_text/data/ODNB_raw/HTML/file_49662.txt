<span class="headword">Yudenitch <span class="st"> [Yudenich]</span>,  Flora  Sandes-</span>  (1876&#150;1956), <span class="occ">nurse and soldier in the Serbian service</span>, was born on 22 January 1876 at Nether Poppleton, near York, the youngest daughter of the Revd Samuel Dickson Sandes (1822&#150;1914) and his wife, Sophia Julia Besnard (<i>d</i>. 1911). She came from a large family, was educated by governesses, and trained as a secretary. She also received first-aid training with the Ladies' Nursing Yeomanry. When war broke out in August 1914 Sandes's immediate offer of service to the War Office as a Volunteer Aid Detachment nurse was rejected. But if Britain did not want her, Serbia did. On 12 August she left London with Madame Mabel Grouitch's Red Cross nursing unit bound for Salonika in Greece. Her first journey to Serbia was fraught with difficulties: France was still mobilizing, trains were disrupted, platforms choked with soldiers on their way to the front, and boats were often scarce. But the nurses arrived after a memorable thirty-six hour voyage from Piraeus to Salonika on the deck of a Greek cattle ship in a raging thunderstorm. From there they travelled by train through the Vardar valley to Kragujevac. A telegram was waiting when Sandes arrived, stating that her father, with whom she had lived until her abrupt departure, had died on 23 August.<br>
<br>Sandes plunged into work at the First Reserve Hospital, where seven English nurses worked with Serbian doctors to tend more than 1000 sick and wounded soldiers. They were casualties of the Serbs' efforts to repel the Austrian invasion across the Danube. After exhausting hours on duty the nurses took turns sleeping on straw mattresses, sharing a single blanket, and eating, all in the same room. The hospital was desperately short of medicine and other supplies, and only the worst cases could be treated with anaesthetic. After the first three months Sandes became deeply committed to the Serbian cause. When she returned to London it was to raise funds for medical supplies, and after only six weeks Sandes's country-wide tour had yielded more than &pound;2000. She returned to Serbia accompanied by an American nurse, Emily Simmonds, literally sitting on packing cases containing 120 tons of cotton, gauze, and other much needed materials.<br>
<br>By this time, the British nurses and doctors in Serbia had assumed political significance. Sandes visited the English consul before leaving Nish and was handed a letter from Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign secretary. Whatever assistance the nurses gave Serbia, he said, was helping Britain and the allies and was of inestimable benefit to the common cause. The British nurses were a highly visible sign of allied concern. The door was thus opened for British women to set their own course of action in Serbia. Flora Sandes became indispensable as a nurse, surgeon, and hospital administrator in Valjevo, where the death rate of typhus victims soared to 70 per cent and more than 200 died each day. Although qualified only as a nurse, Sandes was soon performing minor surgery. The loss of medical staff to typhus was enormous. At the end of the month only one Serbian doctor, an orderly, and the nurses remained. &#145;Looking back&#146;, Sandes wrote in 1927, &#145;I have just naturally drifted by successive stages from nurse to soldier&#146;  (Sandes, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 12). But it was actually only fifteen days after joining the Serbian army's 2nd regiment's ambulance unit that she was asked to stay on. When the regiment pulled back to within a few miles of Monastir, the regimental commander, Colonel Milic, required Sandes to make a decision. Unequivocally, she chose to remain with the regiment, overjoyed that &#145;I represented England!&#146;  (ibid., 14). From the Serbs' perspective, it was entirely reasonable since there were other women in the army; enlistment was often haphazard and Sandes's ability to shoot and ride were highly prized. At home on leave the following year she undertook major fund-raising throughout England.<br>
<br>Whatever reservations were expressed about women in the ranks at home, however, Sandes's experience and position demanded the same respect shown to any official representative of an allied army. She had returned home wearing the Kara George star&#151;the highest medal awarded to non-commissioned officers&#151;for her bravery during the Serbian retreat into Albania. She had lived in the trenches with her comrades, shared their food, slept underneath their overcoats, divided her last cigarettes and crusts of bread with them, and was severely wounded in November 1915 by a Bulgarian bomb. Promoted to sergeant she was wounded again in July 1917 and returned to her unit the following October. She participated in the final offensive against the Austrian and Bulgarian forces and was demobilized on 31 October 1922. She also acted for the Serbs as a fund-raiser and unofficial ambassador, conducting speaking tours in Australia and Britain and along the western front.<br>
<br>After more than six years serving in the Serbian army, and having reached the rank of captain, Flora Sandes settled in Belgrade and found that demobilization made it necessary to relinquish her hard-won honorary male status. On 14 May 1927 she married a fellow officer, a Russian named Yuri Vladimovich Yudenich, and though they both retired to civilian life, she felt a permanent incapacity to settle down to anything. She tried her hand at driving Belgrade's first taxi cab, wrote an autobiography, acquired a speed-boat licence, taught English, and acted as a matron to a dancing troupe in Paris. She was called up for service again in 1941 but after the bombing of Belgrade, both she and Yuri were interned by the Germans. They were released but Yuri died in September 1941 and Flora returned to England via South Africa.<br>
<br>Flora Sandes-Yudenitch died from obstructive jaundice at the Ipswich and East Suffolk Hospital, Anglesea Road, Ipswich, on 24 November 1956. She was cremated on 27 November at the Ipswich crematorium and her ashes were placed in the garden of remembrance.<br>
