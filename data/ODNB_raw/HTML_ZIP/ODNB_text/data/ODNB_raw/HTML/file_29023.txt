<span class="headword">Welwood,  James</span>  (1652&#150;1727), <span class="occ">physician and writer on politics</span>, was born in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, the third son of John Welwood (<i>c</i>.1603&#150;<i>c</i>.1680) and Margaret Dury (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;1659). Formerly a teacher, the elder Welwood began preaching on a rota basis at Leuchars in 1643, and by 1659 had procured a parish near Annandale, Dumfriesshire. Mrs Welwood died that same year. In 1663 the Revd John Welwood, an ardent Presbyterian, was dismissed for refusing to accept episcopacy in Scotland. Both of James Welwood's older brothers, John and Andrew, became irreconcilable covenanters. In 1668 Welwood enrolled at St Andrews University (St Salvator's College), receiving his BA and MA degrees by 25 July 1671. He probably taught at a school in Fife for a few years. Welwood later acknowledged that his brother John's sermons against Archbishop James Sharp implicated the Welwood family in Sharp's murder in 1679, forcing him to flee Scotland  (appendix to <span class="italic">Mercurius Reformatus</span>, 1692).<br>
<br>Welwood studied medicine on the continent, apparently at Leiden and Paris, and spent some time at the court of William of Orange in the Hague before graduating MD from Rheims in 1684. His experience in France during the years when the government of Louis XIV eroded the policy of religious toleration and persecuted Huguenots instilled in him a desire for religious accommodation under a protestant king. On his return to Scotland that year Welwood was arrested for corresponding with Scottish exiles in the Netherlands, but he was released and practised medicine for a time in Edinburgh. In 1685 he married Barbara Armor (<i>c</i>.1665&#150;<i>c</i>.1700), who in 1686 gave birth to Mary Welwood Maxwell, the first of their three daughters.<br>
<br>Welwood moved across the border to Newcastle upon Tyne in 1687 and after the arrival in England of William of Orange the following year, engaged in a published war of words with John March, vicar of Newcastle. Their letters appeared in March's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Present Great Revolution in England</span> (1689). Welwood strongly supported the revolution of 1688, mainly because he viewed the Dutch prince as a champion of protestantism against the twin dangers of the Roman church and Catholic France. In the first weeks of 1689 Welwood migrated to London and began publication of the twice-weekly Williamite journal <span class="italic">Mercurius Reformatus</span>. He caught the attention of Bishop Gilbert Burnet, who admired his writing style and political views; Welwood proved useful in the campaign to deflect Jacobite propaganda emanating from the continent. Welwood was appointed an extra-physician to William and Mary in March 1690, and elevated to physician to the person by warrant from the lord chamberlain in April of that year. Accordingly the Royal College of Physicians welcomed him as a royal doctor when he became a fellow in 1690  (annals, RCP Lond.). In January 1691 he was named superintendent of surgeons in the fleet, the first of many government medical appointments. From the spring of 1691 he also functioned as a reformist commissioner for the sick and wounded, and as principal physician to the forts along the Thames.<br>
<br>Despite the favour shown him by William and Mary, Welwood and his printer, Richard Baldwin, were castigated by the House of Commons in November 1691 for criticizing in <span class="italic">Mercurius Reformatus</span> the parliamentary management of war appropriations. Welwood ceased publication of the paper immediately thereafter, and, at the request of Queen Mary, started to write a history of the reign of Charles I. Disturbed by a number of critical works on her grandfather's life, the queen charged Welwood with writing for her private edification an honest account, which he expanded to a hundred-year survey after her death, and published in 1700. <span class="italic">Memoirs of the most Material Transactions</span>, generally sympathetic to Charles I, went through multiple editions and influenced later whig historians.<br>
<br>Welwood's first wife died about the turn of the century and in 1703 he married Elizabeth Tregonwell Seymour (<i>c</i>.1670&#150;1732), daughter of John Tregonwell, and widow of Henry Seymour. The Welwoods lived in the York Buildings just off the Strand. During the next two decades he wrote an almanac (1705); authenticated Bulstrode Whitelocke's manuscript on early English history (1709); translated Xenophon's <span class="italic">Symposium</span> as <span class="italic">The Banquet</span> (1710); and wrote a lengthy preface to an English verse rendition of Lucan by Nicholas Rowe (1718). Welwood was also active in the Royal College of Physicians, becoming a censor and an elector in 1722. In 1726 he acted as a go-between in the tumultuous triangle that included Prince George, his mistress and friend of the Welwood family Henrietta Howard, and her husband Charles. Before a settlement was reached Welwood died, on 2 April 1727 at his home in York Buildings, and was buried in the vault of his parish church, St Martin-in-the-Fields. He was preceded in death by his daughter Barbara Welwood Molesworth, but nominated his unmarried daughter Jane Welwood as executor of the estate. Most of Welwood's wealth was distributed to family and friends. His wife's dowry was returned to her as part of a pre-nuptial agreement; she died in 1732.<br>
<br>The James Welwood of this article should not be confused with the <a name="cosubject_56303"></a><span class="headword">James Welwood</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1652&#150;1727)<span class="occ"></span> who was the son of Robert Wellwood, of Touch, and his wife, Jean Livingstone, and who has often been wrongly credited with Welwood's works.<br>
