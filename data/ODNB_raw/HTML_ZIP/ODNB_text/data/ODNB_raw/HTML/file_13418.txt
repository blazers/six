<span class="headword">Hoddesdon,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1632&#150;1659), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the second son of John Hoddesdon (<i>bap</i>. 1594) and Isabel Rymell, daughter of Anthony Rymell. Probably born in London, he was descended from Nicholas, elder brother of Sir Christopher Hoddesdon, merchant adventurer. His father died young and a lawyer great-uncle, Christopher Hoddesdon of the Inner Temple, befriended him and was the dedicatee of his first two books. Hoddesdon's first publication, religious epigrams entitled <span class="italic">Sion and Parnassus</span> (1650), contains as frontispiece a lively engraved portrait, once keenly collected, of Hoddesdon aged eighteen, but is now mainly noteworthy for the young Dryden's prefatory verses commending the author. The future poet laureate here credited &#145;my friend&#146; Hoddesdon with having &#145;inspired&#146; in him some poetic proficiency. Dryden had then only recently left Westminster School for Cambridge, and it is reasonably inferred that Hoddesdon too had attended Westminster (his father had certainly been there, and at Oxford in 1612 had contributed to verses lamenting the death of Prince Henry). No later association between Hoddesdon and Dryden is known. Hoddesdon's own verse sits within a broadly puritan tradition but is infected by a relentless punning, even on sacred subjects, that grated on successive commentators. In 1652 he compiled a life of Thomas More. It was later compared unfavourably with other early lives&#151;typically, Hoddesdon devotes a section to More's &#145;Wit and Wisdome&#146;&#151;and a previous owner has annotated the copy in the London Guildhall Library &#145;a ridiculous author&#146;. His last literary endeavour, the rare <span class="italic">Holy Lives of God's Prophets</span> (1654), attracted little notice.<br>
<br>Hoddesdon turned to trade, becoming in 1658 the East India Company's third-ranking factor in Persia, with an annual salary of &pound;30. He soon moved to the company's base at Surat, north of Bombay, and explored trading opportunities along the coast southwards to Ceylon. He died suddenly at Surat on 28 January 1659, leaving privately contracted debts of 62,775 mahmudis. A year later contention persisted between creditors in India and consignees of his goods in England. Letters of administration were granted to his elder brother, Christopher, on 28 March 1660. The 1662 reissue of Hoddesdon's life of More (essentially unaltered, though the dedicatee had died in 1660) was perhaps to help clear remaining debt. He was unmarried.<br>
