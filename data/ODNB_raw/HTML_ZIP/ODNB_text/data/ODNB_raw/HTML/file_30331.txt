<span class="headword">Adam,  James</span>  (1860&#150;1907), <span class="occ">classical scholar and philosopher</span>, born on 7 April 1860 at Kinmuck in the parish of Keithhall near Inverurie in Aberdeenshire, was second child and only son of James Adam and his wife, Barbara Anderson. The father owned the general store and tailor's shop which served the neighbouring countryside; he died of typhoid fever when his son was only eight. His mother by her own energy carried on the business, and brought up her six children. He made rapid progress at the parish school of Keithhall under George Kemp MA, and having spent some months at the grammar school of Old Aberdeen won the third bursary at Aberdeen University in October 1876. Though chiefly interested in Greek, Adam took a good place in most of the classes of the arts course. His devotion to Greek was fostered by the professor, William Geddes. In 1880 he graduated with first-class honours in classics and carried off the chief classical prizes and the Ferguson scholarship. Meanwhile in spring 1880 he had been elected classical scholar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. In summer 1882 he was placed in division one of the first class in the classical tripos, part one. In 1883 he just missed the Craven scholarship, but in 1884 was awarded the first chancellor's medal and obtained a specially brilliant first class (only once equalled) in part two of the classical tripos with distinction in classics, ancient philosophy, and comparative philology.<br>
<br>In December 1884 Adam was elected a junior fellow and was soon appointed classical lecturer of Emmanuel College, where he settled down at once to his life's work as a teacher. During his undergraduate career at Cambridge he had concentrated with increasing enthusiasm on the study of Plato, and for the rest of his life some work of Plato (most frequently the <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> or some books of the <span class="italic">Republic</span>) was usually the subject for one of the two courses of intercollegiate lectures. Aristotle's <span class="italic">Ethics</span>, Lucretius, Cicero's <span class="italic">De finibus</span>, and above all the Greek lyric poets were also frequent subjects. His lectures were full of wit as well as learning, and however mystical some might consider his philosophical views, there was no lack of precision in his scholarship.<br>
<br>Throughout his teaching career Adam took classes with rare intermissions at Girton College, and was a keen supporter of the claims of women to degrees, when the question came before the senate of the university in 1897. He married, on 22 July 1890, one of his Girton pupils, Adela Marion (1866&#150;1944), youngest daughter of Arthur Kensington, formerly fellow and tutor of Trinity College, Oxford. They had two sons and a daughter. Adela Adam taught classics at Girton and Newnham colleges and became a research fellow of Girton (1920&#150;23).<br>
<br>Adam regarded a knowledge of Greek as an essential part of university education, and he resolutely opposed all attempts to make Greek an optional subject of study. At Easter 1890 he visited Greece. In the same year he was appointed joint tutor of his college with William Napier Shaw, and in 1900, the number of tutors having been mean time increased, he succeeded Shaw as senior tutor. His relations with pupils and colleagues were kindly and affectionate, while his efficiency as a lecturer proved of great benefit to the college. The changes in the classical tripos, which came into force in 1903, emphasized the importance of ancient philosophy, and the college hall was barely able to hold the numbers that flocked to Adam's lectures on Plato and Aristotle.<br>
<br>In 1887, inspired probably by his closest friend, Robert Alexander Neil, Adam published his first edition of a Platonic dialogue, the <span class="italic">Apology</span>. This was followed by the <span class="italic">Crito</span> in 1888, the <span class="italic">Euthyphro</span> in 1890, and (in conjunction with his wife) the <span class="italic">Protagoras</span> in 1893. In 1890 he had announced an intention of preparing an edition of the <span class="italic">Republic</span>. In 1897 he published a revised text. This, however, differed in many passages from the large edition in two volumes which appeared after many years of labour in 1902, and immediately took its place as the standard edition. Adam's notes and excursuses, which are very concise considering the difficulty of the subject, represent a judgement based upon a thorough knowledge of the vast work of his many predecessors. The outstanding quality of his translations and notes is reflected in the longevity of his scholarly work: a second edition of his <span class="italic">Republic</span> was published in 1962 and of his <span class="italic">Protagoras</span> in 1971.<br>
<br>In textual matters Adam became steadily more conservative, believing that the tradition of the Platonic text was in the main quite sound. An investigation preliminary to his edition of the <span class="italic">Republic</span> was a discussion in his <span class="italic">Platonic Number</span> (1891). His interpretation was confirmed by Professor Hilprecht's discovery of the Babylonian perfect number. At Christmas 1902 he was nominated Gifford lecturer at Aberdeen, choosing for his subject &#145;The religious teachers of Greece&#146;, and delivering the lectures in 1904 and 1905.<br>
<br>In spring 1907, Adam, who, amid his unceasing work, retained his youthful appearance in middle age, was attacked by illness. He died on 30 August 1907 at 5 Albyn Place, Aberdeen, after an operation, and was buried at Woking.<br>
<br>The Gifford lectures, which were left complete but not finally revised for publication, were edited with a short memoir by Adam's widow and published in 1908 (2nd edn, 1909). A collection of his essays and lectures, <span class="italic">The Vitality of Platonism, and other Essays</span>, was edited by his widow in 1911. These collected papers best illustrate the bent of Adam's mind in later life. For many years he had been deeply interested in the relationship between Greek philosophy and the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Though he would not have said with Westcott that &#145;the final cause of Greek was the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>&#146;, he certainly tended to regard Greek philosophy pre-eminently as a &#145;Praeparatio evangelica&#146;, and his occasional lectures on such semi-religious topics at summer meetings in Cambridge found large and appreciative audiences. Witty and paradoxical in conversation, though with a vein of melancholy in his nature, Adam found fullest scope for his abilities as a teacher, and to education in the highest sense all his work as lecturer and writer was devoted.<br>
