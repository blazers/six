<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morris,  Edward Patrick</span>, first Baron Morris  (1859&#150;1935), <span class="occ">politician in Newfoundland</span>, was born at St John's on 8 May 1859, the third son of Edward Morris, originally of Waterford, Ireland, and his wife, Catherine Fitzgerald. His father was a cooper and later keeper of the St John's poorhouse. Morris received as good an education as the colony could offer, at St Bonaventure's College. He taught at Oderin, Placentia Bay, from 1874 to 1878, and then spent a year at the high school attached to the University of Ottawa. On his return he studied law, and was called to the bar in 1885. He started a law firm with his brother soon afterwards.<br>
<br>In 1885 Morris was also elected to the house of assembly as an independent member for the largely working-class and Roman Catholic district of St John's West. He promoted himself as a champion of working people, and adopted the then novel tactic of door-to-door canvassing. He proved to be a consummate local politician, and became enormously popular among his constituents. Re-elected nine times, he represented the district to the end of his political career in 1917. He became so influential in the town of St John's as a whole that by 1890 some newspapers were referring to him as &#145;Boss Morris&#146;.<br>
<br>In the assembly Morris championed social legislation such as workmen's compensation and safety standards on fishing vessels. He also supported electoral and local government reform, particularly in St John's. In 1889 he joined the Liberal Party, led by Sir William Whiteway, who appointed him to the cabinet (without portfolio) after his election victory that year. Morris's appointment recognized his influence in St John's and bolstered Roman Catholic representation in the government. He deputized for Whiteway in the attorney-general's office and handled a significant number of law bills, besides steering important legislation dealing with higher education. He was not closely involved in the major controversies with which the government had to deal, however, and did not achieve real prominence until the late 1890s, in which decade he also edited the <span class="italic">Newfoundland Law Reports</span>.<br>
<br>In December 1894 the two local banks suspended payment, creating financial chaos and a real possibility of colonial bankruptcy. Morris was a member of a delegation, led by Robert Bond, which went to Ottawa in 1895 to discuss confederation. The draft terms were ungenerous, depended on British financial aid (which was refused), and, had they been accepted, would almost certainly have pitted Morris against his constituency, since most Newfoundland Roman Catholics were committed anti-confederates. In the end the colony survived by floating a loan.<br>
<br>In 1898 Morris dramatically broke away from the Liberal Party, then in opposition and led by Bond, over the tory government's decision to transfer the operation and ownership of the colony's railway and telegraph systems, as well as other franchises and much land, to Robert G. Reid of Montreal (who had built most of the railway). Morris, who was close to the Reid family, thought the deal promised economic development at little risk to the colony, while Bond considered it an immoral sell-out. As it also envisaged a considerable number of jobs in St John's West, Morris and a small number of supporters voted in favour of the deal, and sat thereafter as independent Liberals. In 1901 Morris married Isobel Langrishe (<i>d</i>. 1934), the daughter of the Revd William Le Gallais and the widow of James P. Fox.<br>
<br>By early 1900 the tory government was on the verge of collapse. Morris saw that if the fiercely anti-contract Bond became premier, the Reid deal and its supporters might well be sent into oblivion. Morris therefore astutely joined Bond in defeating the government, thereby safeguarding his political future, and enabling him to salvage the essence of the Reid contract. He joined the cabinet, becoming minister of justice in 1902, and pressured Bond into modifying rather than repealing the contract. He was knighted in 1904.<br>
<br>Morris remained in the Bond government until 1907, when he suddenly resigned his portfolio and from the party. It was the first step in a carefully planned strategy. Bond had made himself unpopular with the imperial government by his anti-American fisheries policy, with the Canadian government by raising the question of American fishing rights at all, and with the Reid family by continued hostility to their ambitions. Since the tory party was weak, Morris was seen as the only politician who could challenge Bond's dominance. With substantial financial backing from the Reids, and winks and nods from other influential allies, he launched the People's Party in 1908. The election that autumn resulted in a tie. Bond mishandled the crisis, giving Morris (who had the sympathetic ear of the governor) the opportunity to form a government in March 1909. He was speedily granted a dissolution and confirmed in office with a comfortable majority.<br>
<br>The record of the Morris government was mixed. It was relatively free-spending, it launched into an overly expensive and arguably unwise programme of building branch railways, and there is evidence that some of its members were involved in speculation in timber lands. Against this must be set the competent handling of the arbitration at the Hague tribunal on American fishing rights under the 1818 convention (Morris appeared for the colony), the introduction of old-age pensions, and needed investment in education and agricultural development. Aided by a buoyant economy and a disorganized opposition, the government was re-elected in 1913, but by this time it was under sustained criticism from the Fishermen's Protective Union, which had elected eight members to the assembly. Morris's attempts to respond to some Union demands upset his mercantile and Roman Catholic supporters, and for the first time cracks in the party began to appear. They were temporarily papered over, however, by the outbreak of war.<br>
<br>The government's unusual method of handling the colony's war effort was in part the result of energetic intervention by the governor, Sir Walter Davidson. Without convening the legislature, the government expanded the local Royal Naval Reserve and created a 500 man regiment. Morris and Davidson organized the Newfoundland Patriotic Association, a politically neutral body involving both citizens and politicians, to supervise the war effort. This unique arrangement lasted until 1917. Morris represented the colony in the imperial war cabinet (1916&#150;17) and attended the imperial war conference in 1917. By this time his government was becoming unpopular, mainly because it seemed incapable of curbing profiteering and controlling inflation. The regiment had suffered heavy losses, and conscription seemed a real and much-resented possibility. Morris proposed a coalition government, making it clear that he would postpone the election scheduled for the autumn of 1917. The resultant National Government, nominally headed by Morris, took office in July. A legislative session soon afterwards wound up the Patriotic Association, which had outlived its usefulness, created a department of militia, and increased direct taxation.<br>
<br>Morris had agreed, before the formation of the National Government, that he would resign as prime minister before the end of the year if appointed Newfoundland's high commissioner in London, but on the recommendation of Davidson, who was ending his term as governor, he received a peerage for his services to the war effort (1 January 1918). It was a rare honour for any colonial politician, and the only case in Newfoundland's history. Morris moved to London and spent the rest of his life in England, and, though he returned to Newfoundland infrequently, championed the colony's interests whenever possible. He held a number of directorships, and served as vice-chairman of the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau. He was also on the governing bodies of the Royal Empire Society, Imperial College, Cardinal Vaughan's School, and the Hospital for Diseases of the Skin. He died of bronchopneumonia at his home, 4 Onslow Square, London, on 24 October 1935, and was succeeded as second baron by his only child, Michael William Morris.<br>
<br>Eloquent, witty, and politically shrewd, Morris climbed the greasy pole without difficulty and remained at or near the top for some thirty years. Though a man of real abilities, he never became a truly dominant figure, relying on alliances with, for example, Robert Reid and Governor Davidson, who did much to influence his policies. He was a survivor and compromiser rather than a visionary, but his premiership nevertheless made a permanent mark on Newfoundland's history, largely as a result of his controversial (and expensive) handling of the war effort.<br>
