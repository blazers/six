<span class="headword">Penny,  John</span>  (1803&#150;1885), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, born at Sherborne, Dorset, on 16 February 1803, was the third son of Elias Penny, bookseller and publisher of Sherborne, and was educated at the King's School there. In 1828 he became proprietor and editor of the old <span class="italic">Sherborne Journal</span>. In the columns of the paper he championed the cause of reform, and thus earned the gratitude of the whigs. In 1832 he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Dorsetshire Emancipated from Tory Dominion</span>, and was rewarded by Lord John Russell with the stamp-distributorship of Dorset. He then moved to Dorchester, but soon afterwards was promoted to a similar but more important post at Leeds. While there he wrote a drama, <span class="italic">Stephen, King of England</span> (1851), which was produced at the Leeds Theatre and favourably received. In 1858 he gave up the <span class="italic">Sherborne Journal</span>, and subsequently retired from official life. For a while he enjoyed his superannuation at the house he had built for himself at Harrogate, but in the early 1870s he developed acute asthma, for the relief of which he had to travel between Bath (for the beneficial waters of its pump room), Bournemouth (for its warm weather and sea air), and, occasionally, a villa in Chetnole, Dorset, which provided him with opportunities for regular walks and physical exercise. Penny died at Bath on 7 February 1885, and was buried on 12 February at Exeter with his wife and only son, who had predeceased him.<br>
<br>Penny's eldest brother, William Webb Penny (1799&#150;1888), was proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Sherborne Mercury</span>, one of the oldest papers in the west of England, from 1829 until 1842. His youngest brother, Charles Penny (1809&#150;1875), of Pembroke College, Oxford, was headmaster of Crewkerne grammar school from 1838 until 1875, and for many years rector of Chaffcombe, Somerset.<br>
