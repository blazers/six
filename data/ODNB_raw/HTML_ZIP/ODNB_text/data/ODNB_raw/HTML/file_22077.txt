<span class="headword">Peyton, Sir  Edward</span>, second baronet  (1587/8&#150;1652?), <span class="occ">parliamentarian political writer</span>, was the eldest of the five sons (there were also six daughters) of Sir John Peyton (<i>d</i>. 1616) of Isleham, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Alice (1563&#150;1626), daughter of Sir Edward Osborne, lord mayor of London in 1565. A nephew of Robert, Lord Rich, the future second earl of Warwick, Sir John held various political offices in Cambridgeshire, was knighted in 1596, and created a baronet on 22 May 1611. Edward studied at the grammar school in Bury St Edmunds and then, according to Anthony Wood, at Cambridge. He also pursued legal studies at Gray's Inn, where he was admitted on 16 August 1611. Although he had no bachelor's degree, he was allowed to proceed MA at Cambridge in 1618.<br>
<br>At Streatham, Surrey, on 24 April 1604 Peyton married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1613), daughter of Robert Livesay of Tooting, Surrey, on which occasion Peyton's father gave him the manor of Great Bradley, Suffolk. Peyton and his first wife had five children, John (1607&#150;1693), Edward, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1611), Thomas (<i>bur</i>. 1 Jan 1614), and Amy (<i>b</i>. 1605), who in October 1623 married Henry Lawrence, politician and lord president of the council from 1653. James I knighted Peyton at Whitehall on 18 March 1611, and he succeeded to the baronetcy and the family estate at Isleham when his father died in December 1616. Following his wife's death in October 1613, Peyton married on 6 June 1614 Jane, daughter of Sir James Calthorpe of Crockthorpe, Norfolk, and widow of Sir Edmond Thimelthorpe (or Sir Henry Thomelthorpe); they had three children, James (<i>d</i>. November 1620), Thomas (1617&#150;1683), and Jane (<i>d</i>. February 1633). Peyton was briefly custos rotulorum of the Cambridge bench between 23 December 1617 and 5 February 1618, when the previous incumbent, Sir John Cotton, was restored. Peyton fully expected to regain the post on Cotton's death in March 1621, but the duke of Buckingham instead granted it to Sir John Cutts.<br>
<br>In 1621 Peyton represented Cambridgeshire in parliament, reporting to the house for the recess subcommittee on petitions, including those dealing with patents. In later speeches he argued that bishops should not try capital cases in the Lords, and he opposed a bill for enclosing more commons, which he did not think &#145;fitt now when Christendom is a garboile&#146;  (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 3.186). Peyton served as sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1622&#150;3. In January 1624 he defeated Sir John Cutts in a hotly contested election to represent Cambridgeshire in parliament. Responding to a petition from Cutts and Toby Palavicini, who had been defeated by Peyton's electoral partner, Sir Simeon Steward, the House of Commons invalidated the election, but Peyton prevailed in a second election on 18 March.<br>
<br>As MP for Cambridgeshire in Charles I's first parliament Peyton served on various committees, including those that dealt with privileges, fraudulently held estates, inebriety, and petty larceny. Sitting again for Cambridgeshire in the parliament of 1626, he was appointed to numerous committees, including those for religion, recusancy, and purveyance, and those that considered Lords' bills regarding adultery and fornication, the export of ordnance, and outlaws. In the Commons he spoke against the bill to drain 360,000 acres of fens, a third of which would have gone to the crown, and he presented a petition against William Gyles, vicar of Elm, Cambridgeshire, for drunkenness, recourse to prostitutes, and slandering Martin Luther, Theodore Beza, and William Perkins. About 1627 Buckingham dismissed Peyton as <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Cambridgeshire, replacing him with Cuts. For instigating a fight with neighbours Peyton was summoned before Star Chamber on 10 October 1632. Despite these difficulties he was not yet a staunch critic of the royal court, for his unpublished manuscript, &#145;A discourse of court and courtiers&#146; (1633), acknowledges that favourites have served the crown by commanding military forces, undertaking embassies, and raising revenue, and are thus entitled to advance their families and augment their estates. However, Peyton was again in trouble in 1638, when Archbishop William Laud and the high commission ordered him to appear before them, presumably for his puritan views. By this time Peyton's second wife had died, and in December 1638 he married the spinster Dorothy Minshawe (<i>c</i>.1617&#150;1681) at St James's, Clerkenwell, Middlesex (according to Burke, his new wife was Dorothy, daughter of Edward Ball of Stockwell).<br>
<br>Although Peyton did not serve in the Short or Long parliaments, his sympathies were clearly with the country, as reflected in his book, <span class="italic">The King's Violation of the Rights of Parliament</span> (1641), criticizing Charles I's attempt to arrest the five MPs. Yet Peyton also insisted that the people had no right to destroy the monarchy. The following year he published <span class="italic">A discourse concerning the fitnesse of the posture necessary to be used in taking the bread and wine at the sacrament</span>, in which he defended his right to partake standing or sitting. To buttress his argument he cited Augustine, Tertullian, Calvin, Bullinger, Beza, Perkins, and others. Roger Cocks responded in <span class="italic">An Answer to a Book Set Forth by Sir Edward Peyton</span> (1642). Peyton would subsequently write prefatory verse for Humphrey Mill's <span class="italic">The Second Part of the Nights Search</span>.<br>
<br>During the first civil war Peyton fought with the parliamentary forces at Edgehill, serving as a captain in the earl of Peterborough's regiment of foot. Captured, he was incarcerated in Banbury Castle. He claimed to have fought against the royalists at Newbury and Naseby, but Joshua Sprigge does not include his name in the list of officers who served under Sir Thomas Fairfax. Beginning in 1644 Peyton's second son, Edward, served under the earl of Denbigh as a lieutenant-colonel of horse in the parliamentary army. Sir Edward offered suggestions to resolve the disputes between Charles, parliament, and the army in <span class="italic">The High-Way to Peace</span> (1647). Peyton's family had suffered financially during the war. Royalist troops had seized household goods worth &pound;400 from Peyton at Broad Chalk, Wiltshire, where his brother Robert was vicar, and because Peyton's son Thomas had fought for the royalists in Wales, he was fined &pound;338 in December 1646. Convinced Sir Edward had conveyed his estates to Thomas during the war, the committee for compounding sequestered them, an action that prompted Sir Edward to protest that his son only had a reversionary interest in the property. The committee reduced Thomas's fine to &pound;169 in February 1649, but the fine to reclaim Rougham Manor, Norfolk, which his wife had inherited from her father, Sir William Yelverton, was set at &pound;1500 in November 1650, though reduced by a third in June 1651. Thomas paid the fine two months later, having raised the money by selling Greenhall Manor, Norfolk.<br>
<br>The bitterness Peyton now felt toward the Stuarts is evident in <span class="italic">The Divine Catastrophe of the Kingly Family of the House of Stuarts</span>, issued by the radical printer Giles Calvert in 1652. In it Peyton defended the regicide and the abolition of monarchy as actions that conformed to the divine will. Underlying this work are Peyton's millenarian convictions and belief in the role of divine providence in ordering human affairs. Peyton even thought God might destroy all the monarchs in Christendom. The precise date of his death is unknown, but he was described by his son Thomas as &#145;late deceased&#146; in a petition of 3 December 1652  (TNA: PRO, C 5/15/81). Peyton died intestate, and his widow, Dorothy, was empowered to settle his estate. His eldest son, John, succeeded him as baronet. Dorothy subsequently married Edward Lowe, vicar of Brighton; she was buried at Brighton on 10 April 1681.<br>
