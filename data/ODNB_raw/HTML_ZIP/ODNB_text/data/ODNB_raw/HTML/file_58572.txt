<span class="headword">Dacres,  James Richard</span>  (1749&#150;1810), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Richard Dacres, one-time secretary to the garrison at Gibraltar, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bateman). He entered the navy in 1762 on the frigate <i>Active</i>, commanded by Captain Herbert Sawyer. On 21 May 1762 the <i>Active</i>, in company with the sloop <i>Favourite</i> cruising off the Algarve, captured the Spanish register ship <i>Hermione</i>, which had sailed from the Caribbean before Britain had declared war on Spain and was thus unaware of the state of hostilities. The <i>Hermione</i> was carrying an enormously rich cargo of dollars, gold coin, ingots of gold and silver, cocoa, and blocks of tin, to the total of &pound;519,705 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. This was sufficient to make every man on the two British ships relatively wealthy, and even the able seamen received the equivalent of approximately thirty-five years' pay. On arrival at Portsmouth the treasure was conveyed to London in twenty wagons, each decorated with flags and accompanied by a party of sailors.<br>
<br>From the frigate <i>Active</i> Dacres was transferred to the frigate <i>Aeolus</i>, commanded by Captain William Hotham. Cruising in the channel, the <i>Aeolus</i> captured a number of privateers and other enemy vessels. The <i>Aeolus</i> also recaptured a British merchantman from Jamaica which was said to be of considerable value. Subsequently Dacres served in the frigate <i>Thames</i>, commanded by Captain John Eliot and, after 1766, the <i>Jersey</i> (60 guns), carrying the pendant of Commodore Sir Richard Spry, commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. Shortly afterwards Spry appointed Dacres lieutenant of the frigate <i>Montreal</i> (32 guns), commanded by Captain Phillips Cosby. He continued in the <i>Montreal</i> until 1774, when Cosby returned to England.<br>
<br>At the commencement of the American War of Independence Dacres was appointed second lieutenant of the frigate <i>Blonde</i>, commanded by Captain Philemon Pownoll. The <i>Blonde</i> was ordered to escort troop transports carrying General Burgoyne's army to Canada. Upon arrival in Quebec in June 1776 Pownoll received a request from Commodore Douglas, commanding British naval forces on the Great Lakes, for the loan of officers and men to assist with the fitting out and manning of ships for service there. Dacres appears to have been selected to lead this party, and upon arrival was given command of the schooner <i>Carleton</i> armed with twelve 6-pounder guns.<br>
<br>Dacres distinguished himself in two actions against American naval forces on Lake Champlain. Of these, the more notable was an attack on 11 October 1776 commanded by Captain Pringle on an American force drawn up to defend the passage between the island of Valicour and the mainland. Because the enemy were to windward only the <i>Carleton</i> and twenty gunboats were able to engage them, which they did for several hours, destroying the largest American schooner and a gondola. At nightfall Pringle recalled the <i>Carleton</i> and the gunboats, and during the hours of darkness the American force withdrew. On the following morning Pringle set off in pursuit and at noon on 13 October he came up with the American force near Crown Point.<br>
<br>After an engagement lasting two hours the American force broke up in disarray. The galley <i>Washington</i>, with General Waterburgh on board, was captured and several other vessels destroyed. Dacres was sent home with dispatches and a recommendation for promotion. Upon arrival he was promoted commander (25 November 1776) and given the sloop <i>Sylph</i> (14 guns). Soon after he was given command of the slightly larger sloop <i>Ceres</i>, serving on the Leeward Islands station. On 1 August 1777 he married Eleanor Blandford Pearce at Totnes, Devon. In March 1778 the <i>Ceres</i>, accompanied by the <i>Ariadne</i> (20 guns), chased two American frigates off Barbados, catching one, the <i>Alfred</i>, on 9 March.<br>
<br>At the end of 1778 the <i>Ceres</i> was captured by the French frigate <i>Iphigenie</i> (36 guns), after a chase of 48 hours, during which Dacres successfully drew the enemy frigate away from the convoy of troop transports which he was escorting. Dacres's commander-in-chief wrote to the Admiralty: &#145;I cannot help regretting the loss of this sloop, not only as she sailed remarkably well, but as Captain Dacres is an officer of infinite merit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, 26.273). On his being exchanged by the French, Dacres was appointed briefly acting captain of the <i>Sultan</i> (74 guns) before being given command of the frigate <i>Maidstone</i> (28 guns). His promotion to post captain does not seem to have been confirmed by the Admiralty until November 1780 when he was given the frigate <i>Perseus</i> stationed at the Downs. Towards the end of the war he commanded the frigates <i>Orpheus</i> and <i>Aurora</i> before being paid off in 1783.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war against revolutionary France in 1793 Dacres was given command of the <i>Sceptre</i> (64 guns) and, as part of Admiral Howe's fleet, was employed blockading Brest and the Bay of Biscay. In July the fleet was sent to engage a French force under the command of Vice-Admiral Morard de Galles off Belle &Icirc;le; however, owing to unreliable winds, the French ships successfully avoided an action.<br>
<br>In the following year the <i>Sceptre</i> was sent to join Commodore Ford's squadron in the West Indies and on 1 June was actively involved in the bombardment and capture of Fort Bizothen at Port-au-Prince. In the West Indies the crew of the <i>Sceptre</i> suffered heavily from yellow fever and the ship was subsequently ordered home as escort to a convoy. On his return to England Dacres was transferred to command of the <i>Barfleur</i> (98 guns) attached to Lord Bridport's fleet in the channel, and he was present when Bridport defeated a French fleet off the southern coast of Brittany in June 1795, though the <i>Barfleur</i> was not involved in the action. At the end of the year the <i>Barfleur</i> became the flagship of Vice-Admiral Waldegrave and was sent to the Mediterranean. In spring 1796 Waldegrave was sent with five sail of the line to recover the British frigate <i>Nemesis</i> which had been captured by the French and was being held at Tunis. On the night of 9 March the boats of the squadron successfully cut out the <i>Nemesis</i> and one of her captors, the French corvette <i>Sardine</i>. The <i>Barfleur</i> was present at the battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797, where she suffered relatively few casualties, before in April Dacres returned to England in the frigate <i>Flora</i>. He was next given command of the new <i>Foudroyant</i> (80 guns) which he retained until February 1799 when he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue.<br>
<br>During the peace of Amiens, Dacres served as commander-in-chief at Plymouth and, on the resumption of war in 1803 he hoisted his flag in the frigate <i>Franchise</i>. He then became second-in-command of the Jamaica station, under Sir John Duckworth, which proved a very lucrative position as some eighty vessels were taken as prizes during this period.<br>
<br>On 23 April 1804 Dacres was raised to rear-admiral of the red, and a year later he succeeded Duckworth as commander-in-chief at Jamaica. He remained at Jamaica until 1809 when, his health having deteriorated, he asked to be recalled. He returned to England, where he died on 6 January 1810.<br>
