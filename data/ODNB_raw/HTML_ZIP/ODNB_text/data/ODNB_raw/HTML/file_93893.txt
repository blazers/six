<span class="headword">Farmer,  Frank Taylor</span>  (1912&#150;2004), <span class="occ">medical physicist</span>, was born on 18 September 1912 at Warbrick, Mount Road, Bexleyheath, Kent, the younger son and youngest of three children of Robert Crosbie Farmer (1877&#150;1960), research chemist, and his wife, Maud Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharpe. After education at Eltham College he read electrical engineering at King's College, London, graduating with first-class honours in 1933. He then spent four years at Clare College, Cambridge, where his research, under the supervision of J. A. Radcliffe, on radio-wave propagation in the ionosphere, led to a PhD in 1937. He was continuing this line of work as a research engineer at the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company in Chelmsford at the outbreak of the Second World War. By this time, always testing the Christian faith imbued in him by his evangelical parents, he had become a convinced pacifist. In 1940 he applied for exemption from military service and resigned from his position with Marconi to take up a post as assistant physicist in the radiotherapy department at the Middlesex Hospital. In doing so he became one of the few physicists appointed to hospitals at that time to deal with the many problems associated with using X-rays and radium for the treatment of cancer. He began working on the measurement of X-rays which culminated in the design of the Farmer dosemeter. This rapidly became the standard instrument for calibrating X-ray machines and measuring X-ray doses in radiotherapy departments across the world.<br>
<br>In 1945 Farmer was appointed physicist to the radium centre based in the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. The rapport he established there with C. J. L. Thurgar, the chief radiotherapist, resulted in both radiotherapy and hospital physics flourishing over the following years in the northern region. With his experience in radio wave propagation and in the practical problems of radiotherapy he helped in the design of a linear accelerator for cancer treatment. As a result, in 1953 Mullard installed the first such gantry-mounted machine in the world in the Newcastle department. Its highly penetrating X-rays could treat deep-seated tumours while avoiding the severe skin damage of earlier X-ray treatments. Farmer's way of enabling the patient to be observed (before the days of closed circuit television) from outside the treatment room with its protective concrete walls up to three feet thick was to install a periscope bought at bargain price from a naval scrapyard.<br>
<br>Farmer was a self-effacing, reserved man, but with drive and energy and remarkable technical skills and creativity. He enjoyed fixing things and relished prolonging the useful life of apparatus. The Mullard accelerator treated patients for over twenty years. The throwaway society was anathema to him. Despite this he was acutely aware of new technical or scientific developments and keen to explore any that would help clinicians with investigation and treatment of patients. He was quick to start research into the clinical uses of the radioisotopes that became available after the Second World War from the nuclear reactors at Harwell and Amersham. The radioisotope tracer technique offered research and diagnostic opportunities in almost every branch of medicine. As a result he introduced a radioisotope service based in the medical physics department that won strong and enduring support from the senior medical staff of all specialities. A happy consequence of his interaction with medical staff was his marriage on 15 September 1960 to Marion Bowie Bethune, a 45-year-old paediatric cardiologist, and daughter of James Bethune, civil servant. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>From the start of his appointment at Newcastle, Farmer thought in terms of providing medical physics services to the whole northern region, either on a peripatetic basis, as with radiation physics, or by inviting referral of patients. He built up an expert centre, attracting and leading a team of specialists in radiation physics, radioisotopes, electronics, ultrasonics, cardiology physics, audiology, and computing, making what were then scarce resources available across the whole northern region. A multidisciplinary approach to problems was his hallmark, as was his insistence that the research he encouraged in his department be clinically relevant. Its academic standing was recognized by his appointment as professor of medical physics at Newcastle University in 1966. He encouraged his staff to be active in the wider medical physics world, as he was. Over the years he served on the International Commission on Radiological Units and numerous other radiological and research committees. He was president of the Hospital Physicists' Association in 1959&#150;60, and of the British Institute of Radiology in 1973&#150;4. In 1974 he was appointed OBE for services to physics applied to medicine, and in 1977 he was awarded the Barclay medal for his outstanding contributions to the <span class="italic">British Journal of Radiology</span>. Even his hobby gained international recognition. Ever since his university years he had been a keen radio &#145;ham&#146;, making friends across the world via his short-wave radio, and in 1977 the Wireless Institute of Australia awarded him its Cook bicentenary award for his contacts that year.<br>
<br>Farmer retired in 1978. His pioneering work in the application of physics to medicine, particularly the practical aspects of radiotherapy, had won international renown and, from being the sole hospital physicist in the northern region, he had established the northern regional medical physics department with a staff of seventy as a centre of excellence. Throughout, his Christian convictions, in particular his pacifism, remained central to his life. Happily he found a soulmate in his wife, Marion. For many years he served on the central committee of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an ecumenical body promoting non-violence and international peace, and the local group met regularly at the Farmers' home. He involved himself wholeheartedly in the controversies of nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and strongly supported the United Nations Association. In his retirement he carried on his ten-year chairmanship of the Newcastle Hospitals' Ethical Committee. He joined the Society of Friends and in addition to his peace work he devoted time to helping the underprivileged in Newcastle, becoming involved in a scheme called Baseline helping young people who were struggling to escape their past and re-establish themselves, and acting as handyman and helper in the People's Kitchen, which provided shelter and food for the lonely and homeless. All this he continued after his wife died in 1991. He moved into a small upstairs flat, 41 Goldspink Lane, in the Sandyford area of Newcastle. Passionately concerned about the exploitation of the earth's resources, he set an example by installing a solar panel in the roof, living frugally, using a bicycle for local journeys (elastic bands serving as clips), and delighting in repairing clocks, bicycles, and all manner of domestic goods. He remained as active as ever until only a few weeks before his death, from pancreatic cancer, on 16 July 2004 at St Oswald's Hospice, Regent Avenue, Newcastle. He was cremated at West Road cemetery and crematorium, Newcastle, on 23 July.<br>
