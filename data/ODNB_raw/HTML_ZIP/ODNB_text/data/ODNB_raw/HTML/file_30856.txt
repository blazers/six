<span class="headword">Brock,  Russell Claude</span>, Baron Brock  (1903&#150;1980), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 24 October 1903 at 840 Old Kent Road, London, the second of six sons and fourth of eight children of Herbert Brock, a master photographer, and his wife, Elvina, daughter of James Carman, of Hinderclay, Walsham-le-Willows, Suffolk. He was educated at Haselridge Road School, Clapham, and at Christ's Hospital, Horsham. An accident in the school laboratory, resulting in severe burns to his face and hands, may well have inspired his interest in medicine and he entered Guy's Hospital medical school in 1921 with an arts scholarship. After an outstanding undergraduate career he qualified LRCP and MRCS in 1926, and graduated MB, BS (London), with honours and distinction in medicine, surgery, and anatomy in 1927. In the same year he married Germaine Louise (<i>d</i>. 1978), daughter of L&eacute;on Jacques Ladav&egrave;ze, of Paris, a gentleman of independent means. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>Following resident appointments at Guy's Brock was appointed demonstrator in anatomy and in pathology, and passed the final FRCS examination in 1929. Elected to a Rockefeller travelling fellowship in 1929&#150;30, he worked in the surgical department of Evarts Graham at St Louis, Missouri, and there developed a lifelong interest in thoracic surgery. On returning to Guy's he became surgical registrar and tutor in 1932 and was appointed research fellow of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. He won the Jacksonian prize of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1935 and was elected a Hunterian professor in 1938.<br>
<br>Brock's more senior posts began with appointment as consultant thoracic surgeon to the London county council (1935&#150;46) and surgeon to the Ministry of Pensions at Roehampton Hospital (1936&#150;45). From 1936 to 1968 he was appointed surgeon to Guy's and the Brompton hospitals. During the Second World War he was also thoracic surgeon and regional adviser in thoracic surgery to the Emergency Medical Service in the Guy's region. Following the war cardiac surgery, and especially operations on the open heart, was developing apace. Brock played a major part in pioneering the surgical relief of mitral stenosis and of other valvular lesions of the heart. His introduction of the technique to correct pulmonary artery stenosis and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in the beating heart was inspired by exchange professorships between himself and Dr Alfred Blalock of Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore. Thereafter Brock, when not the initiator, was ever to the fore of new developments in this fast-expanding field of surgery. This came to overshadow some of his earlier contributions to lung surgery, the basis for which had been described in his own classical publication on the anatomy of the bronchial tree in 1946.<br>
<br>Brock was an outstanding diagnostician, a conscientious teacher, and meticulous in the care of his patients. He gave great service to the Royal College of Surgeons, serving on its council from 1949 to 1967 and being an active member or chairman of many of its standing committees. He was vice-president in 1956&#150;8 and president in 1963&#150;6. He gave the Bradshaw lecture in 1957 and the Hunterian oration in 1961. He was knighted in 1954 and elevated to a life peerage in 1965. On retirement from his hospital appointments in 1968 he continued in private practice for a while, and he also became director of a newly formed department of surgical sciences at the Royal College of Surgeons which had been set up during his presidency. Subsequent alterations to this department caused him much upset and disappointment.<br>
<br>Brock's medical awards and honours were numerous. He was president of the Thoracic Society of Great Britain and Ireland in 1952; and of the Society of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, and also of the Medical Society of London in 1958. An elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1965, he had become an honorary fellow of the American College of Surgeons in 1949; the Brazilian College in 1952; the Australasian College in 1958; the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1965; and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1966. He was honorary fellow or member of a number of surgical societies abroad, as well as the recipient of many foreign and domestic prizes and gold medals. He received the highly prestigious international Gardiner award for 1960&#150;61, and was appointed Lister medallist and orator in 1967. He also received honorary degrees from the universities of Hamburg (1962), Leeds (1965), Cambridge (1968), and Guelph and Munich (both 1972).<br>
<br>Having been appointed assistant editor of the Guy's Hospital reports before his election to the senior staff, Brock was editor from 1939 to 1960. Thenceforward he contributed a stream of important papers on cardiac and thoracic surgery to medical and surgical journals and textbooks. He was the author of several important books: <span class="italic">The Anatomy of the Bronchial Tree</span> (1946), <span class="italic">Lung Abscess</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The Life and Work of Astley Cooper</span> (1952), and <span class="italic">The Anatomy of Congenital Pulmonary Stenosis</span> (1957).<br>
<br>Brock could be a difficult person to get to know and to some he seemed excessively fussy and meticulous. But he was a man of total dedication and integrity who gave unswerving support to those of his juniors who shared his own very high standards. His students were taught with firmness and courtesy. He was a shy, kindly man who could often seem brusque, particularly in the operating theatre. Outside his professional work he had considerable knowledge of old furniture and prints, and of history, including medical history. Less well known was his interest in private medicine: he served on the governing body of Private Patients Plan and was chairman (1967&#150;77) before becoming its president. He was responsible for the discovery and restoration at Guy's of an eighteenth-century operating theatre on the site of the old St Thomas's Hospital.<br>
<br>After his first wife's death in 1978, Brock married in 1979 Chrissie Palmer Jones, his secretary, daughter of John Alfred Jones, secretary to a colliery. Brock died in Guy's Hospital on 3 September 1980.<br>
