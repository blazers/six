<span class="headword">Bankes, Sir  John Eldon</span>  (1854&#150;1946), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 17 April 1854 in London, the eldest son of John Scott Bankes (1826&#150;1896) of Soughton Hall, Flintshire, and his first wife, Annie (1829&#150;1876), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14795/', "Sir John Jervis")</script>, chief justice of the common pleas. He was directly descended from Sir John Bankes, chief justice of the common pleas in 1641. His father's mother was the daughter of the lord chancellor, John Scott, first earl of Eldon.<br>
<br>Bankes was educated at Eton College, where he was president of the rowing club, and rowed for the school at Henley in 1872. From Eton he went on to University College, Oxford (1872), where he was secretary of the Oxford University boat club and president of Vincent's Club, having rowed for Oxford in 1875 when, after five successive defeats, they won the boat race by 10 lengths. After graduating with a second class in jurisprudence in 1876, he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1878 and was a pupil of Richard Webster (later Viscount Alverstone). On 10 August 1882 he married Edith (1856&#150;1931), daughter of Robert Peel Ethelston of Hinton Hall, Shropshire; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Modest, unassuming, and courteous, good-looking and with a dry sense of humour, Bankes had a good practice on the common-law side and took silk in 1901, having become a bencher of his inn in 1899. He was unsuccessful as Unionist candidate for Flint in 1906, although a profile in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> stated that had the women and children of the constituency enjoyed the suffrage, he would have won easily. In 1910 Lord Chancellor Loreburn appointed him a puisne judge and he was knighted; in 1915 he was promoted to the Court of Appeal and became a privy councillor.<br>
<br>As judge and lord justice, Bankes won a high reputation as a careful, clear-headed, and able lawyer. During his latter years in the Court of Appeal, he acted as chairman of one of its branches, and in this capacity, often sitting with Sir T. E. Scrutton and Sir J. R. Atkin, he gave the first judgment in many important cases that illustrated his grasp of common-law principles. The prestige of this branch of the Court of Appeal under his chairmanship is evidenced by the small number of appeals made to the House of Lords from its unanimous decisions. Bankes retired in 1927 and was made a GCB in 1928.<br>
<br>Throughout his long life Bankes was a devoted churchman. He was at one time treasurer and later chairman of the London Diocesan Fund, served as chancellor of St Asaph diocese (1908&#150;10), and with John Sankey and Atkin drafted the constitution of the disestablished Church in Wales. He was chairman of the representative body of the Church in Wales (1928&#150;43). At the age of eighty-one he was appointed chairman of the royal commission on traffic in arms. He was chairman of Flintshire quarter sessions for thirty-three years, and was an alderman and chairman of Flintshire county council.<br>
<br>Treasurer of the Inner Temple in 1923, Bankes was an honorary LLD of Wales (1921) and Manchester (1923), an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, and a fellow of Eton. A countryman at heart, he enjoyed managing the home farm and family estate of Soughton Hall, Northop, Flintshire, which he inherited from his father in 1894. Tall and athletic, he walked daily from his home in Eaton Square to the Temple, and at weekends during term was wont to take a train into the home counties and walk his preferred distance of 21 miles, carefully measured on a pedometer.<br>
<br>Bankes died aged ninety-two on 31 December 1946 at Soughton Hall. He was cremated on 4 January 1947, and his ashes were interred in the family vault at St Peter and St Eurgain, Northop, on the 7th. His son, Robert Wynne Bankes, was private secretary to successive lord chancellors (1919&#150;29) and before his retirement in 1950 successively assistant secretary and secretary to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The younger daughter, Margaret Annie, married Sir W. H. P. Lewis, her father's former pupil.<br>
