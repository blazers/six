<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deakin,  Alfred</span>  (1856&#150;1919), <span class="occ">prime minister of Australia</span>, was born on 3 August 1856 at 90 George Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne, the younger child of William Deakin (1819&#150;1892), business manager, of Towcester, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bill (1822&#150;1908), of Llannarth, Cardiganshire. Deakin's parents were married in October 1849 and left England for Australia two months later, disembarking at Adelaide, where their daughter, Catherine Sarah, was born in July 1850. When gold was discovered in 1851, William Deakin briefly tried his luck on the Victorian goldfields, but by 1853 the family was living in Melbourne, where Deakin senior became the manager of a coaching business.<h2>
<a name="Educationandentryintopolitics"></a>Education and entry into politics</h2>Deakin was brought up in a small, close-knit family in which he was the centre of attention. His sister, Catherine, was his nurse and mentor, and in later years his confidante and admirer. At the age of four he joined Catherine at a boarding-school in the country, before attending Melbourne Church of England grammar school from 1864 to 1871. A precocious child with a passion for books, he preferred to indulge his own elaborate fantasies rather than pursue his studies, but his talents were recognized and he did well enough to matriculate. At Melbourne University, between 1872 and 1877, he studied law and seized such opportunities as the small academic community offered for intellectual discussion and debate. He also became involved in the spiritualist movement, playing a leading part in its Sunday school, the Progressive Lyceum, and becoming president of the Victorian Association of Progressive Spiritualists in 1878. In 1877 he published an extraordinary spiritualist allegory, <span class="italic">A New Pilgrim's Progress</span>, which was the product of his s&eacute;ance experiments with automatic writing and which he believed, at the time, to have been inspired by the spirit of John Bunyan.<br>
<br>Deakin was admitted to the bar in 1877, but an introduction in 1878 to David Syme, owner of the Melbourne <span class="italic">Age</span>, deflected him into the much more appealing practice of journalism. Syme persuaded Deakin to forsake the free-trade beliefs he had absorbed at university for the protectionist programme espoused by the <span class="italic">Age</span>; he also helped Deakin's nomination in the liberal interest for a by-election in 1879 for the Victorian legislative assembly, which he won by a narrow margin. Deakin's d&eacute;but in parliament at the age of twenty-two proved dramatic when he concluded his maiden speech by resigning because of controversy surrounding the conduct of the poll. He lost the second by-election by fifteen votes, but finally won the seat at a general election in 1880.<br>
<br>Deakin was a striking, even handsome, young man, 6 feet tall and slim with dark hair and a trim beard. Always fluent and articulate, he was an eloquent speaker whose versatile, light baritone voice was reinforced by his graceful presence. Many recalled that his dark, glowing eyes contributed to the effect. A bachelor when he entered politics, on 3 April 1882 Deakin married the nineteen-year-old Elizabeth Martha Anne 
    (Pattie; 1862/3&#150;1934)
  , daughter of Hugh Junor Browne, a wealthy distiller, and his wife, Elizabeth. He had met her through the spiritualist movement, but the Brownes, conscious of Deakin's lack of means and uncertain prospects, agreed to the marriage only reluctantly, and there was no dowry. With the beginning of his political career Deakin distanced himself from spiritualist organizations, but he retained an investigative interest in spiritualist phenomena.<br>
<br>Deakin's arrival in parliament coincided with the end of a period of divisive politics involving constitutional conflict between the legislative council, elected on a restricted property franchise, and the popular assembly. At a time when Victoria was entering a phase of heady prosperity, the mood encouraged political compromise, and when a coalition government of conservatives and liberals, led by James Service and Graham Berry, took office in 1883, Deakin, a supporter of Berry, became minister for public works and water supply. In 1885 his rapid rise was confirmed when, with Berry's retirement, he became the leader of the liberals and chief secretary in the government now headed by Duncan Gillies. He and the coalition government remained in office until 1890.<br>
<br>The government's legislative programme was largely uncontroversial, but in 1885 Deakin introduced a <span class="roman">Factories and Shops Bill</span>, a basic regulatory measure which drew opposition from the legislative council and was passed only in modified form. Much less contentious was his enthusiasm for irrigation: having chaired a royal commission on water supply in 1884 he led a mission to California to investigate irrigation schemes. Although the state-aided schemes introduced in Victoria were not without their problems, Deakin played a significant part in developing public awareness. In 1885 he published <span class="italic">Irrigation in Western America</span>, and a later visit to India, sponsored by <span class="italic">The Age</span>, resulted in <span class="italic">Irrigated India</span> in 1893.<h2>
<a name="Relationswiththeimperialgovernment"></a>Relations with the imperial government</h2>In 1887 Deakin represented Victoria at the colonial conference which was timed to coincide with Queen Victoria's golden jubilee, and which was seen by the imperial government as an opportunity for coaxing the colonies into making a greater contribution to imperial defence. Deakin attracted attention when, responding to prime minister Salisbury's opening speech, he asserted that Victorians knew no distinction between &#145;colonial&#146; and &#145;imperial&#146; interests, and made it clear that Victoria would press its case concerning the empire's role in the Pacific. Deakin was not the only Australasian representative to urge the imperial government to be firm in its negotiations with France over the New Hebrides, but as a native-born colonist he was regarded with particular interest. He returned home to a hero's welcome.<br>
<br>By 1890 Victoria's economic boom had burst, and the national maritime strike of that year ushered in a period of industrial dislocation and depression. Deakin's own financial speculations had been disastrous and he had been associated as chairman or director with several dubious companies. With the defeat of the coalition government he retreated to the back bench for a decade, devoting himself, as a kind of creative penance, to the cause of federation. He emerged through the 1890s as the acknowledged leader of the federal movement in Victoria. Practical concerns about the depression, defence, and Asian immigration all contributed to the growing interest in federation, but Deakin, a member of the Australian Natives' Association (which only native-born colonists were eligible to join), sought to give the movement a higher, national focus. At the conventions of 1891 and 1897&#150;8 he advocated a democratic constitution and sought to limit the powers of the senate as a states' house, but he also played a major role in negotiating the essential compromises between divergent colonial interests. When in 1898 the Victorian government and <span class="italic">The Age</span> hesitated to endorse the proposed <span class="roman">Constitution Bill</span>, Deakin, in a celebrated speech at Bendigo, helped turn the tide, and Victoria voted overwhelmingly for the bill at referendums in 1898 and 1899.<br>
<br>In 1900 Deakin journeyed to England, together with representatives of the other colonies, to negotiate with colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain points at issue with the imperial government concerning the constitution. Most in contention was a clause preventing appeals to the privy council in matters involving interpretation of the constitution, which Chamberlain proposed to delete. Deakin, together with Edmund Barton of New South Wales and Charles Kingston of South Australia, campaigned vigorously against Chamberlain: a compromise preserved the right of appeal, but by leave of the Australian high court, and left the power further to limit such appeals with the parliament of the Australian commonwealth. Learning of Chamberlain's capitulation, the three leaders joined hands and danced in a gleeful circle. The incident entered political folklore after Deakin recorded it in his history of the federal cause, <span class="italic">The Federal Story</span> (1944).<br>
<br>In London, Deakin was introduced to the proprietor and the editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> and was afterwards invited to act as the newspaper's Australian correspondent. Remarkably, he was to retain this position through the rest of his political career, often commenting on his own successes and failures. As a journalist of old, he probably gained some satisfaction from this well-kept secret, but the &pound;500 a year it earned him also helped the family's finances.<h2>
<a name="Primeminister"></a>Prime minister</h2>When Barton, his colleague and fellow Protectionist, formed the first commonwealth government in 1901, Deakin joined it as attorney-general, and, on Barton's appointment to the high court in 1903, succeeded him as prime minister, holding that office in 1903&#150;4, 1905&#150;8, and 1909&#150;10. During his first two periods of government, when no party commanded a majority in the house of representatives, Deakin and his Protectionists governed with the support of the infant Labor Party. In Victoria the labour movement had been committed to protection, and Labor members in the 1890s had often been regarded as the left wing of the liberal Protectionist Party. Like a number of middle-class liberals and radicals, Deakin had responded to the onset of the depression and mass unemployment by seeking legislative means of addressing &#145;the social question&#146;. Thus the Protectionists and the Labor Party had found common ground in advancing factory legislation, direct taxation, and old age pensions. In the new commonwealth parliament, however, not all Labor members were supporters of tariff protection, and Deakin had to find new means of cementing the alliance. In promoting what was called the &#145;new protection&#146;, he sought to ensure that protection for the manufacturer was matched by regulated wages and conditions for the worker. Although high court decisions impeded its implementation, the new protection became the slogan of the liberal&#150;Labor alliance.<br>
<br>Deakin is usually seen as the key figure in the first decade of the Australian commonwealth when the nation's institutional structure was created and its founding policies were enshrined in legislation. The establishment of the high court and the commonwealth arbitration court, the introduction of the restrictive immigration policy (commonly known as the white Australia policy), the commitment to defence (including compulsory military training), could, along with tariff protection, all be seen as part of the programme of nation building. If politics were becoming more polarized, there nevertheless appeared to be a degree of consensus underpinning the Deakinite project.<br>
<br>Although the alliance with the Labor Party was productive, Deakin complained of the unsatisfactory state of federal politics with &#145;three elevens&#146; in the field. In 1908, when Labor withdrew its support from the Protectionists and itself formed a government, Deakin negotiated a fusion with his former enemies, the conservative Free-Traders, and returned to office in 1909. With protection now secure as the national policy, Deakin believed he had won good terms for the merger, but many saw the fusion as a betrayal of his liberal principles, and at the 1910 election the Labor Party was swept into office with majorities in both houses. He had the satisfaction of leading the successful 1911 campaign against Labor's proposed amendments to the constitution extending commonwealth power, but in 1913, his health seriously impaired, he retired from politics.<h2>
<a name="Assessmentanddeath"></a>Assessment and death</h2>Deakin was both a nationalist and an imperialist. He had no qualms about supporting Britain in the South African War, and during the &#145;Dreadnought scare&#146; of 1909, when he was briefly in opposition, he was in the forefront of the agitation for Australia to offer Britain a dreadnought. He was also aware of Australia's own defence priorities, and invited the American &#145;great white fleet&#146; to visit Australian ports in 1908. While attending the Imperial Conference of 1907, Deakin, a supporter in principle of imperial federation, sought a more active role for the self-governing dominions, but his advocacy of imperial preference fell on deaf ears. It was perhaps unfortunate that his views were more appealing to British Conservatives than to the dominant Liberals, so that the publicity he attracted in England cast him as an oppositional figure. While Deakin was not beyond enjoying the attention accorded him, both he and his wife were critical of the social outlook and morality of the Edwardian society which f&ecirc;ted the colonial representatives, and, like many Australian visitors, they were disturbed by the prevalence of urban poverty. Throughout his career his democratic instincts prevented him from accepting any imperial honours.<br>
<br>As a liberal leader at a time when the party system was taking shape, Deakin occupied a strategic position, and his alliance with the emergent Labor Party helped lay the political foundations of the new nation. Deakin was as sincere in his commitment to social reform as he was to federation, yet he was also a consummate politician who was more artful than he cared to admit. He was a man of wide cultural and intellectual interests, whose circle of acquaintances included poets, painters, and musicians. While his public image is suggested by the nickname Affable Alfred, he was an intensely private man who valued the inner life. Some years after his involvement with spiritualism he became interested in theosophy, but for the most part his undogmatic Christianity found expression within the home, which he once described as &#145;the city of refuge&#146;.<br>
<br>Deakin had been conscious of his declining mental powers as early as 1907. He died on 7 October 1919, at his home, Llanarth, Walsh Street, South Yarra, Melbourne, of meningo-encephalitis. He was given a state funeral and buried on 9 October at St Kilda cemetery, Melbourne, with Anglican rites. He was survived by his wife, Pattie, his three daughters, Ivy, Stella, and Vera, and his sister, Catherine.<br>
