<span class="headword">Clowes,  William</span>  (1780&#150;1851), <span class="occ">a founder of the Primitive Methodist Connexion</span>, the son of Samuel Clowes, potter, and Ann, daughter of Aaron Wedgwood (a member of the illustrious ceramics family), was born at Burslem, Staffordshire, on 12 March 1780, and employed during his early years as a potter. He was considered one of the finest dancers in his neighbourhood and for many years led a dissipated life, but on 20 January 1805 he was converted during a prayer meeting. He soon established a prayer meeting in his own house, became the leader of a Wesleyan Methodist class, and joined a society which endeavoured to promote the keeping of the sabbath. He was one of the attendants at the first camp meeting ever held in England, at Mow Cop, near Harriseahead, on 31 May 1807, and was joined in this meeting by Hugh and James Bourne and others. In October 1808 he preached his trial sermon near Ramsor on the Staffordshire&#150;Derbyshire border and was duly appointed a local preacher with the Wesleyan Methodists, but, continuing to associate with the Bournes and to attend camp meetings, his name was omitted from the preachers' plan in June 1810. In September his quarterly ticket as a member of the society was withheld from him by the Burslem Wesleyan authorities, who were angered by his &#145;irregular&#146; methods of evangelism.<br>
<br>After this Clowes made common cause with the Bournes and James Crawfoot, and with them was one of the founders of the Primitive Methodist Connexion, which dates its commencement from 14 March 1810. From this time he became one of the best-known, most forceful, and confident preachers of the new society, and his vigorous labours in most of the northern counties of England, as well as in London and Cornwall, were most successful in adding members to the church. In 1819 he visited Hull, where Primitive Methodism was as yet unknown, and such was the impact of his preaching that within six months 300 people had joined the society. Hull became one of the major centres of Primitive Methodism. On 10 June 1842 he was placed on the superannuation fund, but still continued his ministry as before, and was at his work until a day or two before his death, from paralysis, which took place at Hull on 2 March 1851. He was buried at Hull. Clowes, who was twice married (he left his first wife after an argument with his mother-in-law), was a man of strong common sense and of great persuasive powers.<br>
