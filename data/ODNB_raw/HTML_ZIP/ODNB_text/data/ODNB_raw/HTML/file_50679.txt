<span class="headword">Chambers,  William</span>  (1724?&#150;1777), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was probably born at Derby. He was the son of John Chambers of Derby (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1693, <i>d</i>. 1751), who is variously described as &#145;Esq&#146; and &#145;Gent.&#146; (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>, 1.319; Glover, 2.469), and of his wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1700, <i>d</i>. 1785). He was educated at Derby School and, aged eighteen, matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 5 March 1743; he graduated BA in 1747 and MA three years later. At Cambridge he formed a friendship with his fellow collegian Theophilus Lindsey, whose latitudinarian, and subsequently anti-trinitarian, theological opinions Chambers came to share. He was ordained deacon in the diocese of Ely on 5 June 1748 and priest in the diocese of Peterborough on 5 November of the same year. According to Lindsey he undertook a grand tour of the Netherlands, France, and Italy. His family was both wealthy and well connected. His aunt Hannah Sophia Chambers had married Brownlow Cecil, eighth earl of Exeter, in 1724 and their son Brownlow, from 1754 the ninth earl, was a contemporary of Chambers at St John's College. The earls of Exeter owned the advowson of the rectory of the church of St John the Baptist, Achurch, Northamptonshire, and it was through their patronage that Chambers was appointed rector of Achurch in 1748.<br>
<br>Chambers married Dorothy Rolleston (<i>d</i>. 1809) probably soon after his institution at Achurch; they had two sons and a daughter. Lindsey asserts that Chambers &#145;was endowed with a peculiar turn for medical knowledge, which he diligently cultivated by the preliminary studies of anatomy, chemistry &amp;c&#146;  (Ditchfield, &#145;The Revd William Chambers&#146;, 9) and that he ministered diligently to the health of the poor of his parish. Though he appears to have published nothing he was awarded a DD by Cambridge in 1762. The endorsements that he wrote on his surviving manuscript sermons suggest that he was a conscientious priest. He developed a close sympathy with those clergymen, among them Lindsey's father-in-law, Francis Blackburne, who objected in principle to compulsory clerical subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. At Achurch, according to Lindsey, he experimented with the liturgy on lines previously suggested by Samuel Clarke: &#145;he never repeated any part of the service, where Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit were addressed and invoked, being persuaded that the God and Father of all, was the only true God and object of worship&#146;  (ibid., 4). That no disciplinary action was taken against him is a mark of the variety of liturgical practice that the eighteenth-century church tacitly accepted, as well as of the latitudinarian principles of Chambers's diocesan, John Hinchliffe, bishop of Peterborough.<br>
<br>In 1771&#150;2 Chambers gave Lindsey full support in the organization of the Feathers tavern petition for the abolition of compulsory subscription to the articles [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93823', "Feathers tavern petitioners")</script>]. The petition was rejected by the House of Commons on 6 February 1772 and, more summarily, on 5 May 1774. On the latter occasion Chambers was present in the Commons gallery with Lindsey, Richard Price, and Joseph Priestley. By then Lindsey had resigned from the church and founded his own Unitarian chapel in London. On his way to London from his former parish of Catterick he resided with Chambers at Achurch. Only a very small number of clergymen followed Lindsey out of the church. For all his identification with Unitarianism Chambers was not among them, although his death from an apoplectic stroke shortly afterwards, at Achurch on 4 September 1777, leaves open the possibility that he might have seceded at a subsequent stage. On his death Lindsey wrote a eulogistic obituary. Chambers was buried at All Saints' Church, Derby.<br>
<br>Chambers bequeathed extensive real and personal estate and it is clear that his private fortune meant that he had no need to compromise his theological principles in a quest for ecclesiastical preferment. His historical significance lies in his association with a group of liberal Anglican clergymen, mostly Cambridge-educated, who helped to stimulate heterodox thought within the church and who contributed indirectly to the development of English Unitarianism.<br>
