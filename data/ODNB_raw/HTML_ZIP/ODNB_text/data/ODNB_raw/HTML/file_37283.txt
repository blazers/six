<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Churchill,  Randolph Frederick Edward Spencer</span>  (1911&#150;1968), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, was born at Bolton Street, Mayfair, London, on 28 May 1911, the only son and second of four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32413/', "Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill (1874&#150;1965)")</script>, later prime minister, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30929/', "Clementine Ogilvy Churchill, n&#233;e Hozier (later Baroness Spencer-Churchill) (1885&#150;1977)")</script>. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford. He was a loquacious and precocious boy, drinking double brandies at the age of eighteen&#151;a habit which did not change over the years. His father disapproved, but told a visitor: &#145;Modern young people will do what they like. The only time parents really control their children is before they are born. After that their nature unfolds remorselessly petal by petal.&#146; Relations between Winston and Randolph were always uneasy, the father alternately spoiling and being infuriated by the son. They accompanied each other in reasonable harmony on Winston's visit to Canada and the USA in 1929, but Randolph displeased his father soon afterwards by leaving Oxford without a degree in order to become a journalist. He was at an early age a fluent writer and speaker, and a vigorous, if at times embarrassing, supporter of his father's cause.<br>
<br>In February 1935, without consulting his father, Churchill stood at a by-election in Liverpool Wavertree as an Independent Conservative against the <span class="roman">India Bill</span>, thus splitting the party vote and letting in Labour. In the general election that autumn he stood, this time as official Conservative candidate, for West Toxteth. He lost, and lost again at a by-election in February 1936 in Ross and Cromarty against Malcolm MacDonald, the National Government candidate and dominions secretary&#151;another embarrassment for his father, who was then angling for a cabinet post. In 1940, thanks to the party truce, he was elected for Preston, but lost in the election of 1945.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Churchill was a major in the 4th Queen's Own hussars, serving on the general staff (intelligence) at general headquarters, Middle East. In January 1944 he was parachuted into Yugoslavia as a member of the Fitzroy Maclean mission to support General Tito. He was joined by Evelyn Waugh and F. W. F. Smith, second earl of Birkenhead. His loquacity maddened his colleagues. There is a story that they bet him a substantial sum that he could not read a certain number of books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> without talking. Well before the end of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> he exclaimed &#145;Christ! This is exciting&#146;, and lost his bet, but never paid  (private information).<br>
<br>After two more unsuccessful attempts to get into parliament in 1950 and 1951 Churchill took to authorship, though continuing as a lecturer, journalist, and broadcaster. His ambition was to write the life of his father. The trustees who owned the papers were not too sure. He decided to show that he was a serious biographer by writing the life of E. G. V. Stanley, seventeenth earl of Derby. It is a reputable if rather dull book; Lord Derby was a dull man. It was published in 1959 and the trustees gave their consent. Churchill assembled a team of ever-changing research assistants&#151;their position was neither easy nor well paid&#151;at his house, Stour, in East Bergholt, Suffolk. In 1964 he wrote <span class="italic">The Fight for the Tory Leadership</span>, a very pro-Macmillan account of the accession of Alec Douglas-Home to the premiership. He was blown out of the water on 17 January 1964 by Iain Macleod, who had just become editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, in one of the most famous and devastating articles that has ever appeared in that journal. For once Randolph Churchill had no comeback. The first volume of his father's biography appeared in 1966, <span class="italic">Youth, 1874&#150;1900</span>; the second, <span class="italic">The Young Statesman, 1901&#150;1914</span>, a year later, along with five companion volumes of documentation (1967&#150;9). He had set the pattern for a major biographical achievement but he died prematurely. The work was carried to completion by one of his leading research assistants, Martin Gilbert. The eighth and final volume appeared in 1988. Churchill was twice married: on 4 October 1939 to Pamela Beryl Hayward (1920&#150;1997), daughter of Edward Kenelm Digby, eleventh Baron Digby [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65682/', "Harriman, Pamela Beryl")</script>]; they had one son, <a href="#cosubject_102597">Winston Spencer Churchill [<i>see below</i>]</a>. The marriage was dissolved in 1946. In 1948 Churchill married June, daughter of Colonel Rex Hamilton Osborne, of Little Ingleburn, Malmesbury, Wiltshire; they had one daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99277/', "Arabella Spencer Churchill")</script>, festival and charity founder. The marriage was dissolved in 1961.<br>
<br>Slim, blond, and good-looking in his youth, Churchill became somewhat bloated in middle age, and his potations did not improve his appearance. Conversation with him could be exciting and enjoyable, but one was uneasily aware of potential explosions. He was not liked in his father's wartime entourage: &#145;I thought Randolph was one of the most objectionable people I had ever met&#146;  (Colville, 177), wrote Sir John Colville, one of Winston Churchill's private secretaries. The shadow of a famous father can often damage a competitive son. Churchill died at his home, Stour, East Bergholt, Suffolk, on 6 June 1968.<br>
<br>His only son, <a name="cosubject_102597"></a><span class="headword">Winston Spencer Churchill</span>  (1940&#150;2010), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, was born on 10 October 1940 at Chequers. After his parents separated he was educated at Le Rosey in Switzerland, Eton College (where he was bullied), and Christ Church, Oxford, where he read modern history and achieved the distinction of a fourth-class degree in 1962. Consciously imitating his grandfather, he then became a war correspondent, covering the Yemen, the Congo, and Angola for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. With his father he wrote a (pro-Israeli) book on the <span class="italic">Six Day War</span> (1967). Adopted as a Conservative candidate, in 1967 he fought a by-election at Manchester Gorton, normally a safe Labour seat, coming within 557 votes of winning it. Having meanwhile covered Nigeria, Biafra, and the Middle East for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in 1970 he was elected as Conservative MP for Stretford, holding the seat through three subsequent general elections; after boundary changes he represented Davyhulme from 1983 to 1997.<br>
<br>For some years a darling of the grassroots of the party, Churchill was a parliamentary private secretary at the Ministry of Housing and Construction and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office under Edward Heath, and a Conservative front-bench spokesman on defence during the early years of Margaret Thatcher's leadership, but he was too outspoken in his generally right-wing views (but perhaps also too mercurial) to progress up the party's hierarchy. He was sacked by Thatcher in 1978 for opposing the renewal of sanctions against Rhodesia, which was by then party policy. He was a staunch supporter of apartheid South Africa, and known also for his hawkish views on the Soviet Union, his support for the re-introduction of capital punishment, and his outspoken opposition to &#145;coloured&#146; immigration; in 1993 his attack on what he described as &#145;the relentless flow&#146; of immigration from the Indian sub-continent  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 May 1993) resulted in much embarrassment for his party, and a stinging rebuke from the prime minister, John Major. In 1996 he was much criticized for brokering the sale of his grandfather's wartime papers to the National Heritage Memorial Fund for &pound;12.5 million (of which he was the chief beneficiary); many contended that the papers already belonged to the nation, and it subsequently emerged that they could have been bought for considerably less. He used some of this money to buy a house in Belgravia. Boundary changes in 1997 abolished his Davyhulme seat, and he decided not to seek another.<br>
<br>Churchill's private life was as colourful as his political career. On 15 July 1964 he married Mary Caroline (Minnie) d'Erlanger (<i>b</i>. 1940), daughter of Sir Gerard d'Erlanger, businessman; they had two sons and two daughters. The marriage survived revelations of his affair with Soraya Khashoggi, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sandra Daly (<i>b. c</i>.1942), wife of the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi (Churchill's identity being revealed during a court case involving three policemen charged with blackmail), but ended in divorce in 1997. On 15 June 1999 he married, secondly, Angele Monique Lucienne (Luce) Danielson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Engelen, a Belgian jewellery maker and designer, and daughter of Guillaume Engelen, businessman. He published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Memories and Adventures</span>, in 1989; among his other books was one on his father, <span class="italic">His Father's Son</span> (1996), and a selection of his grandfather's speeches, <span class="italic">Never Give In</span> (2003). He died in London on 2 March 2010 of cancer; his funeral was held on the 9th at St Martin's Church, Bladon, Oxfordshire.<br>
