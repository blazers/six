<span class="headword">Cope, Sir  Alfred William</span>  (1877&#150;1954), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in Kennington, London, on 14 January 1877, the eldest of eleven children of Alfred Cope, bottle merchant, and his wife, Margaret Elizabeth Dallimore. He joined the civil service as a boy clerk in the customs and excise, the lowest possible rung of the Whitehall ladder in one of its least prestigious departments. In 1896 he became a customs detective, in 1908 he was made a preventive inspector, and soon afterwards he was placed in charge of investigations throughout the London area, pursuing smugglers and illicit distillers. Contemporaries said there was always something of the sleuth about him. Cope was, however, also a gifted administrator and organizer, and it was these attributes rather than his talent for clandestine work which saw his translation from the arcane world of customs and excise enforcement into the Whitehall mainstream. In 1919 he was appointed second secretary in the Ministry of Pensions, with the task of bringing order to a department on the verge of collapse. In itself this promotion was a remarkable achievement for a man of modest origins and limited education who had entered the civil service at the humblest rank. The magnitude of his Whitehall success was, however, destined largely to be forgotten because of the dramatic course of the last two years of his public service career, in which he became a key figure in the framing of the Anglo-Irish settlement of 1921&#150;2.<br>
<br>Cope's ability and his unconventional background appealed to the powerful head of the civil service, Sir Warren Fisher. In May 1920 Fisher brought Cope as one of two assistants on an inspection of the Irish administration, which was showing signs of collapse under the pressures of the Anglo-Irish War. Fisher then advised Lloyd George to transfer a number of high-calibre Whitehall officials to Dublin, led by Sir John Anderson, in order to effect fundamental reform. Cope became an assistant under-secretary in Dublin Castle. His main task was to develop lines of communication to the Irish separatist leadership in order to explore possibilities for a settlement. He, Anderson, and other officials soon became convinced that the existing policy of thoroughgoing coercion of the separatist movement was futile, and that efforts should be made to reach an accommodation with Irish nationalism based on dominion home rule and protections for Unionist Ulster: they made their views plain to a meeting of cabinet ministers on 23 July 1920, although strains within the coalition government meant that their arguments were discounted.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, supported by Anderson, by Fisher, and by Lloyd George, Cope persisted in probing the possibilities for compromise even as the Anglo-Irish War intensified. He did this with zest, courage, and initiative, on occasion having to shake off British intelligence agents as he travelled to clandestine meetings. His Dublin Castle colleague Mark Sturgis kept a diary in which he paints a vivid picture of &#145;Andy&#146; Cope's relentless hunt for a means of ending the Anglo-Irish conflict, sometimes infuriating the police and army in the process. Cope won the respect and confidence of the separatist leaders, and after playing a key role in the negotiation of the July 1921 truce he became the main point of liaison between the British government and the emerging twenty-six-county state. He also established, organized, and staffed the new Northern Ireland administration, and at one point in 1921 was believed to be London's choice for the crucial post of permanent secretary of the ministry of finance in Belfast. However, his views on policing sectarian conflict made him suspect in Ulster Unionist eyes, and the idea was dropped. An intense and excitable man, he worked tirelessly to bring the Anglo-Irish treaty of December 1921 to fruition, and in the tense days leading up to the outbreak of civil war in Dublin in June 1922 he ensured that the pro-treaty provisional government got the resources necessary to confront anti-treaty forces, and oversaw the arrangements for the final transfer of civil authority to the government of the Irish Free State.<br>
<br>Despite his high standing as a result of his achievements in Ireland, Cope chose not to return to the more sedate world of pensions administration in Whitehall. Instead he retired towards the end of 1922. He was appointed KCB, having been created CB in 1920. Cope then became general secretary of the National Liberal Party, but he found his hero Lloyd George a difficult employer and in 1924 he resigned. He played one further part in Anglo-Irish relations, giving private advice to the Irish government during the 1925 boundary commission crisis. He went into business as managing director of a group of collieries, where he experienced modest success before retiring in 1935. When war came in 1939 he briefly returned to Whitehall as a volunteer worker under his old chief Sir John Anderson, but soon stood aside. He died on 13 May 1954 at his home, 11 Westdown Road, Seaford, Sussex.<br>
