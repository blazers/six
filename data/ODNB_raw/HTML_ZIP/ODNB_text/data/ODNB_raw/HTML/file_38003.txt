<span class="headword">Stanley,  Simon Carl <span class="st"> [Charles]</span></span>  (1703&#150;1761), <span class="occ">sculptor and stuccoist</span>, was born in Copenhagen on 12 January 1703, the son of a British father and a Danish mother. He was apprenticed in 1718 to a Danish sculptor&#150;stuccoist, J. C. Sturmberg, and assisted his master at Fredensborg Castle and with a monument in Roskilde Cathedral. Following a period in Amsterdam with Jan van Logteren, Stanley came to London in 1727 and entered the studio of Peter Scheemakers, a former assistant of Sturmberg. Only three well-executed monuments have been identified as by Stanley, all of them of the 1740s and obviously reminiscent of those by Scheemakers. Two are large, with lifesize figures, and are to members of the Maynard family at Little Easton, Essex, and at Hoxne, Suffolk. The third, in Ely Cathedral, is a simpler mural monument, with a bust of Humphry Smith (<i>d</i>. 1743), and was designed by the architect John Sanderson.<br>
<br>Stanley was also an able stuccoist, but, as with his sculptural works, little can as yet be assigned to him with certainty until the 1740s. Ceilings decorated by him are at Compton Place, Sussex, <i>c</i>.1728, with mythological subjects in high relief, as well as a plaster medallion with a portrait of an architect, who might be Colen Campbell. Among other houses in which Stanley was engaged on decoration are Ditchley, Oxfordshire (<i>c</i>.1739), Langley Park, Norfolk (<i>c</i>.1740), and perhaps Kirtlington Park, Oxfordshire (<i>c</i>.1745). For a time Stanley worked in collaboration with an Oxford plasterer, Thomas Roberts, at the Radcliffe Camera (<i>c</i>.1744). In 1738 he took John Dawson, a plasterer, as his apprentice.<br>
<br>While working at Okeover, Staffordshire (<i>c</i>.1745), on decorative plasterwork, chimney pieces, and picture frames, Stanley left England suddenly in October 1746, on being offered the post of court sculptor to Christian VI of Denmark. As the king had died before Stanley's departure, he landed to find an uncertain future, until the appointment was confirmed by Frederick V. He spent the remainder of his life in Denmark, was appointed professor of sculpture at the Danish Royal Academy, and besides continuing to produce monuments, ceilings, garden sculpture, and other decorative artefacts, he was a musician, composed an oratorio, and translated books into Danish, including <span class="italic">Joseph Andrews</span> (1753) by Henry Fielding.<br>
<br>Stanley married twice. On 21 May 1730 he married Anna Allen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1735), in Eastbourne, Sussex; they had three daughters. On 2 August 1737 he married Magdalen Margrethe Lindemann (<i>d</i>. 1763), half-sister to Dr Butjeman, German chaplain to the court of St James. They had two sons, one of whom, Carl Frederick (<i>b</i>. 1738), was also a sculptor. Stanley died on 17 February 1761 in Denmark.<br>
