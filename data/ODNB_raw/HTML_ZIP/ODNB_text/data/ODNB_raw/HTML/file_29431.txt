<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1551&#150;1613), <span class="occ">religious writer and ecclesiastical lawyer</span>, was a Yorkshireman by birth. His precise origins are unclear, though it is known that his family held land in Bradford. His university education began when he matriculated as a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1571. He took his BA degree in 1575. Shortly afterwards, Wilkinson began to make intensive investigations of the Family of Love, a mystical religious fellowship; he would become one of its principal opponents.<br>
<br>Wilkinson became a fellow of St John's in 1577, by which time he was also working as a schoolmaster in Cambridge. His plans to publish a book criticizing the Family of Love were already well advanced, and he sought and received encouragement from Richard Cox, bishop of Ely. In 1578 he took his MA degree and busied himself with his research. He knew several members of the Family of Love personally, and responded to their request for written articles setting out his objections to their theology. In 1579 this document, accompanied by the Family's responses, was published in Wilkinson's <span class="italic">Confutation of Certain Articles Delivered unto the Family of Love</span>. The work was dedicated to Bishop Cox, who added a short commendation on the cover, and it also included notes written against the Family by John Young, bishop of Rochester. The <span class="italic">Confutation</span> drew attention to what Wilkinson regarded as the Family's gross doctrinal and moral errors. These included a belief in human perfectibility, a penchant for allegorizing scriptural facts, and a collective lifestyle characterized by extreme secrecy. Wilkinson warned that the Church of England was in terrible danger, and rebuked its ministers for the general laxity of their religious attitudes.<br>
<br>Wilkinson's sympathy with puritanism in this phase of his life was demonstrated again in 1580, when he wrote the dedicatory epistle in <span class="italic">A Very Godly and Learned Treatise, of the Exercise of Fastyng</span>, which was almost certainly by Thomas Cartwright. Wilkinson's dedication was addressed to the Lady Paget and to Mr Edward Carie, a member of the queen's privy chamber, and was written &#145;at my Poore house&#146; in St Botolph, Aldersgate, London.<br>
<br>From 1588 Wilkinson held the prebend of Fridaythorpe in York Cathedral, receiving a dispensation so that he could do so despite being a layman. His future, however, lay in the southern province. Early in 1589 he was awarded a doctorate in law at Cambridge. Wilkinson was then elected, with Lord Burghley's support, to the chancellorship of the diocese of Salisbury. He took up the post in 1590 and held it until the end of his life. Throughout this period he discharged his functions with admirable skill and sensitivity. It was also in 1590 that Wilkinson became an advocate in the court of arches, and received a warrant from the archbishop of Canterbury for admission to Doctors' Commons. His academic allegiance subsequently shifted from Cambridge to Oxford, where in 1593 he took a doctorate in civil law (by incorporation). Wilkinson was probably the W. W. who, at some point before 1594, translated and published passages from Luther in <span class="italic">A Methodicall Preface Prefixed before the Epistle to the Romanes</span>. Between 1608 and 1613 he also served as a justice of the peace for the county of Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Wilkinson died in October 1613, and his will was granted probate by the prerogative court of Canterbury. He bequeathed his lands in the parish of West Wellowe, Wiltshire, to Mary, his &#145;loving and welbeloved wife&#146;, during her lifetime. The date of his marriage has not been established. Mary was also granted the right to occupy his dwelling house, held by lease from the vicars-choral of Salisbury Cathedral. There were no surviving children, and Wilkinson consequently made cash bequests totalling &pound;216 to a number of siblings, nephews, nieces, and servants.<br>
