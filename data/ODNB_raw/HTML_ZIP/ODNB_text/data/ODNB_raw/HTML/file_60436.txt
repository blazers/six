<span class="headword">MacLeod,  Murdo Allan</span>  (1926&#150;1996), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 5 September 1926 at Glendale, Skye, the second of four children of John MacLeod (1893&#150;1971), then a postman, and his wife, Christina MacLeod (1897&#150;1972).<br>
<br>Some of MacLeod's earliest years (1930&#150;39) were spent in Glasgow, where the family was then resident. In 1939 they moved to Inverness, where the parents owned and managed the Kingsmills House Hotel. MacLeod was educated at the Dingwall Academy (1939&#150;42), and then at the Inverness Royal Academy on leaving which in 1945 he began to train for a career in accountancy. Being persuaded of a call to the Christian ministry, however, he entered the University of Edinburgh and undertook an arts degree (1948&#150;52). He then studied theology in the Free Church of Scotland college (1952&#150;5). While in Edinburgh he met and on 11 September 1954 married Nancie Margaret Johnstone (<i>b</i>. 1930), a science graduate of the University of Edinburgh and a school teacher. There were four children of this marriage, two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1955 MacLeod was ordained to the Christian ministry and inducted as Free Church of Scotland minister in Tarbert, Argyll. This ministry lasted until 1963, when he transferred to Crouch End, London, as minister of the Free Church congregation there. Having had a long interest in Christian missionary work directed to the Jews, in London MacLeod became a member of the council of management of the International Society for Jewish Evangelism (IJS). When in 1970 the directorship of the society became vacant he was appointed to that position and so began what became his most significant life's work, extending over the next twenty-two years.<br>
<br>As director and general secretary of the IJS, MacLeod negotiated a union with the Barbican Mission to the Jews; the new society adopted the name Christian Witness to Israel. For a few years he was a joint director of the new society, but upon the death of the other joint director, the Revd Stephen Levinson, he assumed sole responsibility. Under his leadership the society adopted a reformed basis of belief and formed significant alliances with other groups worldwide, notably Jews for Jesus, whose board MacLeod joined, as also that of the German Evangeliumdienst f&uuml;r Israel. This involved almost constant journeys to Europe, the USA, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and, of course, Israel. The work in Israel had a special place in his interest and effort. One of his colleagues there later noted that:<blockquote>Murdo transformed the Society into a purpose orientated Society in which direct evangelism was a clear goal. He guided the work of the Society in Israel away from an emphasis on social and medical work toward a Society that had as its goal the strengthening of the local Churches in Israel in the work of evangelism. He made room for local leadership and supported local initiatives. (private information)</blockquote>A significant part of local initiative was in the founding of a publishing house to supply Christian literature in Hebrew. A bookshop had earlier been instituted and handed over to the local church.Murdo MacLeod became well known in the international scene as a leader in planning missionary strategy. From 1983 to 1991 he was international president of the Lausanne Consultation on Jewish Evangelism. He was a signatory of the Willowbank declaration on the Christian gospel and the Jewish people, a document drawn up by an international group after, as they declared, &#145;several days of intense consultation&#146; and commended to the churches.<br>
<br>Over the years MacLeod contributed articles to many books and journals. In 1984 he was elected moderator of the general assembly of the Free Church of Scotland. He retired from the leadership of Christian Witness to Israel in 1992, suffering from heart disease which had necessitated bypass surgery. Heart failure caused his death on 26 April 1996 at his home, 11 St Martins Drive, Eynsford, Dartford, Kent. He was buried in Union Church cemetery, Crockenhill, Kent, on 2 May.<br>
