<span class="headword">Osburh <span class="st"> [Osburga]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>839), <span class="occ">consort of &AElig;thelwulf, king of the West Saxons</span>, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8921/', "&#198;thelwulf (d. 858)")</script>, who was son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8581/', "Ecgberht, king of Wessex")</script> (<i>r</i>. 802&#150;39), while he was sub-king of Kent (825&#150;39). The marriage probably occurred well before 839, for, on &AElig;thelwulf's succession to Wessex, their eldest son became sub-king of Kent, while their second son was attesting charters from <i>c</i>.840. Osburh's father, Oslac, according to Asser, the late ninth-century biographer of her youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/183/', "Alfred (d. 899)")</script>, was:<blockquote>King &AElig;thelwulf's famous butler, &hellip; a Goth by nation, for he was sprung from Goths and Jutes, namely from the seed of Stuf and Wihtgar, two brothers who received control over the Isle of Wight from their uncle King Cerdic and Cynric his son. (<span class="italic">Life of Alfred</span>, chap. 2)</blockquote>This story identified the roots of Osburh's family, her Scandinavian ancestors, and also their relationship to the Cerdicings. Osburh, as far as is known, was the mother of all &AElig;thelwulf's offspring: a daughter, &AElig;thelswith, and five sons: &AElig;thelstan, who seems to have died <i>c</i>.851, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8901/', "&#198;thelbald (d. 860)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8904/', "&#198;thelberht (d. 865)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8913/', "&#198;thelred (d. 871)")</script>, and Alfred, all four of whom were successively kings of Wessex. That Alfred bequeathed two of his three daughters (perhaps only a life-interest in) estates in the Isle of Wight may lend some colour to the story of Osburh's ancestral Wight-ish connections.<br>
<br>Osburh is not mentioned in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. No charter attestations of hers are known, though an &#145;Osric <i>princeps</i>&#146;, perhaps her brother, attested from the 840s to 860. According to the contemporary Frankish annals of St Bertin, s.a. 856, it was &#145;not customary for the West Saxon king or his people to confer [on the king's wife] the title of queen&#146;. In 856, when &AElig;thelwulf married the Carolingian princess Judith, and broke with custom by naming her queen, Osburh may already have been dead, or else she was repudiated.<br>
<br>Asser, apparently relying on Alfred's reminiscences, says &#145;[Osburh was] an extremely pious woman, noble in character and by birth&#146;. She is best known through Asser's story about the book of &#145;Saxon songs&#146; (<i>carmina Saxonica</i>) which &#145;she showed to Alfred and his brothers, saying: &#147;I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn [that is, memorize] it the fastest&#148;&#146;; and when Alfred:<blockquote>attracted by the beauty of the book's initial letter, &hellip; asked, &#145;Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?&#146;, she smiled with pleasure and, reassuring him, said, &#145;Yes, I will&#146;. (<span class="italic">Life of Alfred</span>, chap. 23)</blockquote>Asser's point was to highlight the special qualities of Osburh's youngest son, Alfred, who learned and recited the book first and presumably won the prize, and whose enthusiasm for &#145;Saxon songs&#146;, and for translations into the vernacular, was later to characterize his reign. The story finds a wider context in ninth-century manuscript evidence for the interest of high-status women in books, and for their role in educating their children.<br>
