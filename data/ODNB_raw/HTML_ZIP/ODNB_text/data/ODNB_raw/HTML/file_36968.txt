<span class="headword">Wilson,  Samuel Alexander Kinnier</span>  (1874&#150;1937), <span class="occ">neurologist</span>, was born at Cedarville, New Jersey, USA, on 6 December 1874, the only son of the Revd James Kinnier Wilson, of co. Monaghan, Ireland, and his first wife, Agnes Legerwood Hately. At an early age he was taken to live in Great Britain and was educated in Edinburgh at George Watson's College and the university. He graduated MA in 1897, MB in 1902, and BSc (with first-class honours in physiology) in 1903. After serving (1902&#150;3) as house physician to Byrom Bramwell at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary he obtained a Carnegie fellowship and studied at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re in Paris, then regarded as the Mecca of neurology, under Pierre Marie and J. F. F. Babinski. After a few months in Leipzig in 1904 he became a resident medical officer at the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, Queen Square, London. Thus began a thirty-three years' association which was ended only by death, for in turn he was house officer, registrar, pathologist, and honorary physician. At this period Wilson formed a friendship with the elderly J. Hughlings Jackson, and he also came under the influence of Sir William Gowers, C. E. Beevor, Henry Charlton Bastian, and other great figures in neurology.<br>
<br>Wilson's monograph on what he termed progressive lenticular degeneration, a genetically inherited copper toxic disease, which damaged the liver, was contributed to <span class="italic">Brain</span> (1912). It gained him not only the degree of MD with gold medal of Edinburgh University, but also international repute. The term Wilson's disease became&#151;and still often is&#151;applied to what came later to be generally known as hepato-lenticular degeneration.<br>
<br>Elected in 1912 to the honorary staff of the Westminster Hospital, Wilson left in 1919 in order to join King's College Hospital as junior neurologist; he became senior neurologist in 1928. He married, in 1913, Annie Louisa, daughter of Alexander Bruce MD of Edinburgh, and had two sons and a daughter. In 1920 Wilson founded the <span class="italic">Journal of Neurology and Psychopathology</span> and became its first editor. He delivered the Croonian lectures of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1925 on disorders of motility and muscle tone, and in 1930 the Morrison lecture of the sister college in Edinburgh. He was president of the neurological section of the Royal Society of Medicine for the two years 1933&#150;5, and was secretary-general of the second International Congress of Neurology (1935).<br>
<br>Wilson's neurological studies were diverse but particularly concerned with epilepsy, narcolepsy, affections of speech, and apraxia. He published a concise account of aphasia (1926) and a collection of papers in his <span class="italic">Modern Problems in Neurology</span> (1928). His <span class="italic">Neurology</span>, edited by Alexander Ninian Bruce, appeared posthumously in two volumes in 1940.<br>
<br>Wilson's strength as a neurologist lay in his philosophical clinical approach to a vexed problem, and in his brilliance as a teacher and writer. He had an unusual capacity for pointing out concepts and ideas which were always stimulating and arresting, and often provocative. In this way he appealed to the imagination of a great number of pupils, and fired in them the zeal for original investigation. His mind was of a highly speculative order and he was not interested in mere descriptive approaches to neurology, although himself a keen observer. He had little opportunity for experimental and laboratory research, but his scientific training enabled him to assess and to criticize the work of others.<br>
<br>Unusually fluent in speech and with his pen, Wilson was in demand as a lecturer and speaker, and as a medical writer, critic, and contributor to periodicals. His clinics at Queen Square were popular with students from all over the world, and abroad his name was probably the best known among British neurologists. Worldwide academic honours were accorded him. He was made <i>officier de l'instruction publique</i> (France), an honorary fellow of the medical academies of Italy and Belgium, and an honorary member of the neurological societies of most European countries as well as of the United States of America and of Japan. Wilson died at his home, 14 Harley Street, London, after a short illness, on 12 May 1937. He was survived by his wife.<br>
