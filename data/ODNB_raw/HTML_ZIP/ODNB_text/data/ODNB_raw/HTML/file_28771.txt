<span class="headword">Warre, Sir  William</span>  (1784&#150;1853), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Porto, Portugal, on 15 April 1784, the eldest son of James Warre and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Greg of Coles Park, Hertfordshire. He was educated at Harrow School and on 5 November 1803 commissioned ensign in the 52nd foot, which he joined at Hythe. Promoted lieutenant by purchase on 2 June 1804, he purchased his company in the 98th foot on 25 April 1806. On 7 August he exchanged into the 23rd light dragoons, and joined them at Clonmel, co. Tipperary, in October 1806.<br>
<br>In the following summer Warre attended the recently established Royal Military College at High Wycombe. In May 1808 he became aide-de-camp to Major-General Sir Ronald Crauford Ferguson, who was serving in an expedition assembled at Cork to attack the Spanish colonies in America. However, the expedition sailed instead for Portugal under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley. Warre took part in the battles of Roli&ccedil;a (17 August) and Vimeiro (21 August), after which he fell ill with dysentery. He was sent to Lisbon, where Major-General William Carr Beresford took him into his house, and on his recovery attached him to his staff. Warre served with Beresford throughout Sir John Moore's campaign, ending with the battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809. Warre remained with his division to cover the overnight evacuation of the army, embarking himself the following afternoon, along with Beresford and the rear guard.<br>
<br>Beresford accepted the chief command of the Portuguese army in March 1809 and took Warre with him, making him a major in the Portuguese service and his senior aide-de-camp. Warre was with Beresford at Lamego and the passage of the Douro on 12 May. After the capture of Porto, Warre destroyed the bridges in the rear of the retreating French army, despite inadequate means and violent opposition from local peasants. As a consequence of Warre's work Wellington was able to overtake Marshal Soult at Salamonde, from where on 16 May Soult managed to escape only by abandoning his guns and baggage. Warre took part in all the operations of Beresford's division 1809&#150;10, but during the withdrawal to the lines of Torres Vedras in September 1810 he fell ill with rheumatic fever and had eventually to return to England.<br>
<br>Warre rejoined Beresford in May 1811 after the battle of Albuera, and took part in the second siege of Badajoz in May and June. He was promoted brevet major in the British army on 30 May 1811, and lieutenant-colonel in the Portuguese service on 3 July. He was at the siege and capture of Ciudad Rodrigo on 19 January 1812, at the third siege and capture of Badajoz on 6 April, where with Lord FitzRoy Somerset he played a prominent part in Wellington's success, and at the battle of Salamanca, where Beresford was wounded, on 22 July. Warre accompanied him to Lisbon and then returned to England.<br>
<br>For his services Warre was made a knight of the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword, and a commander of the Portuguese order of St Bento d'Avis (1816). He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel in the British army on 13 May 1813. His <span class="italic">Letters from the Peninsula, 1808&#150;1812</span> was edited by his nephew the Revd Edmond Warre in 1909.<br>
<br>Warre married on 19 November 1812 Selina Anna (<i>d</i>. 3 Feb 1821), youngest daughter of Christopher Thomson Maling of West Herrington, Durham, and sister of the first countess of Mulgrave. They had seven children, three of whom died in South Africa. The third son, General Sir Henry James Warre (1819&#150;1898), colonel of the Wiltshire regiment, served in the Crimean and New Zealand wars.<br>
<br>On Beresford's advice Warre accepted the appointment of deputy quartermaster-general at the Cape in 1813, returning from there in 1821. Two years later he was appointed one of the permanent assistant quartermasters-general, and for the following fourteen years served in middle-ranking staff appointments, mostly in England and Ireland. In December 1826 he was appointed assistant quartermaster-general of the force hastily assembled under Lieutenant-General Sir William Henry Clinton to aid the Portuguese who were threatened by Spain. The troops did not have to fight, and Warre returned to England in 1828. In 1837 he was made commander of Chatham garrison. He was made CB on 19 July 1838 and knighted in 1839. On promotion to major-general on 23 November 1841 he relinquished the command in Chatham and became colonel of the 94th foot (Connaught Rangers). He was promoted lieutenant-general in November 1851 when he retired. He died at York on 26 July 1853 and was buried at Bishopthorpe.<br>
