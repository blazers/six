<span class="headword">Brundrett, Sir  Frederick</span>  (1894&#150;1974), <span class="occ">government scientist</span>, was born on 25 November 1894 at Sunny Bank, Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire, the eldest in the family of seven sons and three daughters of Walter Brundrett, of Hinxhill, Kent, general secretary and accountant with the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron, and Coal Company, and his wife, Ada, daughter of James Richardson, of Chorlton-cum-Hardy. He was educated at Rossall School, Fleetwood, Lancashire, and at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He obtained a first class in part one of the mathematical tripos (1914) and was a wrangler in part two (1916). He then served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, joining the wireless branch in 1916. After demobilization in 1919 he joined the scientific staff of the Admiralty and was appointed to the Royal Naval Signal School. In 1920 Brundrett married Enid, daughter of George Richard James, schoolmaster, of Chesterton, Cambridgeshire. Their only child, a son, was killed in Italy in 1944. He remained at the signal school until 1937, when he was transferred to the headquarters of the Royal Naval Scientific Service in London and promoted to principal scientific officer. He became a superintending scientist in 1939, assistant director of scientific research in 1940, deputy director in 1942, and in 1946 succeeded Sir Charles Wright as chief of the Royal Naval Scientific Service. In 1950 he was appointed deputy scientific adviser to the minister of defence, serving first under Sir Henry Tizard and then under Sir John Cockcroft, whom he succeeded in 1954 as scientific adviser and chairman of the defence research policy committee.<br>
<br>During his service in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Brundrett became engaged in research work on underwater communications with submarines. At the signal school he played a leading part in the development of short-wave radio. He would not, however, have claimed to have made a great contribution to fundamental scientific knowledge, and he once described himself as the worst circuit engineer who ever joined the Royal Naval Scientific Service. His great strength lay in his ability to apply scientific principles to the practical development of new types of equipment. He also showed a great talent for administrative work in the field of science and it was this that enabled him to play such an effective role, first as chief of the Royal Naval Scientific Service and later during his time at the Ministry of Defence. Before he became scientific adviser himself, he had taken an increasing share of the workload, especially after Tizard's retirement, when Cockcroft combined the position of scientific adviser with that of head of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment. He was thus well prepared and established when he himself succeeded in 1954.<br>
<br>In those days, before the absorption of the separate service departments and the Ministry of Supply into the Ministry of Defence, the scientific adviser's function lay in the co-ordination of policy towards scientific research and the development of new equipment for the armed forces. Brundrett fulfilled this with great skill. He won the confidence not only of successive ministers, but also of successive members of the chiefs of staff committee, who came to rely more and more upon his practical approach and valued his advice on problems ranging well beyond the strictly scientific. Much of the co-ordinating work was done in the defence research policy committee or in specially appointed working groups. Brundrett, being a shrewd judge of people, proved a masterly chairman.<br>
<br>In 1954 Brundrett became an honorary fellow of Sidney Sussex College. He was appointed CB in 1946, KBE in 1950, and KCB in 1956. He received an honorary DSc from Manchester in 1956. After his retirement from the Ministry of Defence in 1959, Brundrett undertook many other tasks in the public service. He was a civil service commissioner for seven years (1960&#150;67), chairman of the Air Traffic Control Board, and chairman of the naval aircraft research committee of the Aeronautical Research Council (1960&#150;66).<br>
<br>In appearance Brundrett was small and spare, with bright blue eyes and the air of an inquisitive bird. His approach was direct, his personality warm and outgoing, his interests wide, and, despite the controversies in which he inevitably became involved, he made no enemies. Throughout his life he was keenly interested in agriculture, and he was himself a very successful farmer. He was chairman of the council of the Red and White Friesian Cattle Society, and an authority on the management of contagious abortion in cattle. He became president of the Agricultural Co-operative Association and devoted much energy to the development of co-operative marketing for poultry and eggs. He was an enthusiastic and skilful player of ball games, excelling particularly in hockey, where he was captain of the Hampshire county and civil service teams. He also played cricket for the civil service, and was an eminent stamp collector. He lived latterly at Fieldside, Prinsted, Southbourne, Sussex. Brundrett died at Fieldside on 1 August 1974.<br>
