<span class="headword">Skeffington,  Johanna Mary <span class="st"> [Hanna]</span>  Sheehy-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Johanna Mary Sheehy]</span>  (1877&#150;1946), <span class="occ">suffragist and Irish nationalist</span>, was born on 24 May 1877 in the Millhouse, Kanturk, co. Cork, the eldest of four daughters and two sons of David Sheehy (1844&#150;1932), mill owner, and his wife, Bessie McCoy (1851&#150;1918), daughter of Richard McCoy of Curraghmore, co. Limerick. In 1887 the family moved to Dublin where Hanna (as she was always known) attended the Dominican nuns' convent school in Eccles Street. From 1896 to 1899 she studied modern languages in Dublin at the Catholic St Mary's University College for women, receiving a BA with second-class honours. In 1902, after further study in Paris and Bonn, she returned to Dublin and was awarded an MA in modern languages with first-class honours. She then became a part-time teacher of literature and languages, always handicapped by the fact that in Ireland all positions of educational authority in relation to Catholic girls were open only to nuns.<br>
<br>The Sheehy family had a long tradition of nationalist politics. Hanna Sheehy's father had originally been a Fenian but then became a constitutional nationalist and MP for South Galway and later for County Meath. He was imprisoned six times for his opposition to British rule and landlordism. Hanna Sheehy's beloved uncle Eugene, known as &#145;the Land League priest&#146;, was a lifelong Fenian and member of the secret Irish Republican Brotherhood. The Sheehys appear as the Daniel family in James Joyce's <span class="italic">Stephen Hero</span>. In Hanna's case her Irish nationalism soon became complicated by a feminism influenced not only by the injustice of her own precarious professional position, but also by her friendship with the ardent radical Francis Skeffington (1878&#150;1916) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46539/', "Skeffington, Francis Sheehy-")</script>], Joyce's &#145;hairy jaysus&#146;. Skeffington was a socialist, pacifist, feminist, anti-vivisectionist, vegetarian teetotaller whose many principles did not prevent him from also being an endearing companion, warm-hearted, and capable of fun.<br>
<br>The Sheehy-Skeffingtons, as they were known ever after, were married on 27 June 1903; their union was to be a passionately political as well as emotional partnership for thirteen years. In 1909 Hanna definitively broke with her religious background, refusing to have her newborn son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54751/', "Owen Lancelot Sheehy-Skeffington")</script>, baptized; thereafter she could not teach in convent schools and was to be an outsider in Catholic Ireland. Having founded the militant Irish Women's Franchise League together with Margaret Cousins in 1908, Hanna suffered her first prison sentence as a suffragist in June 1912 for &#145;wilful damage&#146; to nineteen panes of glass, property of the War Office. She was sentenced to two months' imprisonment&#151;a heavier sentence than that imposed on a wife-beater that same day. Meanwhile in London, her father, the Irish MP, voted in favour of forcible feeding of suffragettes on hunger strike. Hanna herself later embarked on a hunger strike in sympathy with English women prisoners but was released after five days without having been subjected to forcible feeding. It was also in 1912 that Francis Sheehy-Skeffington co-founded the radical paper the <span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span> for which Hanna wrote numerous articles in support of Irish women's right to vote. In November 1913 Hanna was arrested while attempting to leaflet the Conservative leader Bonar Law in Dublin. She was charged with assaulting the police officer who had in fact seized and shaken her. Refusing bail, she went to prison and, in protest against the magistrate's refusal to hear her counter-charge, went on hunger strike until freed after five days.<br>
<br>The watershed of Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington's life was the Easter rising of 1916. Francis Sheehy-Skeffington was an Irish nationalist but also a pacifist who had written many passionate advocacies of passive resistance as the way to win Irish independence. He was opposed not only to the First World War but also to the attempt by the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army to overthrow British rule by force. Nevertheless he was arrested, unarmed and unresisting, while trying to prevent mob looting, and was shot without trial on Wednesday of Easter week by a firing party under a British officer. Thereafter Hanna, always more of an Irish nationalist and less of a pacifist than her husband, became deeply involved with Sinn F&eacute;in. In July 1917 she returned secretly to Ireland after a lecture tour of the United States that had raised significant funds for Michael Collins. She was arrested by the British government and imprisoned first in the notorious Dublin Bridewell and then moved to Holloway, London, only to be released after hunger striking. In 1920 she was elected Sinn F&eacute;in councillor on Dublin corporation and later, in 1925, on Dublin city council. After the establishment of the Irish Free State, Hanna continued to be a republican gadfly, supporting Maud Gonne and Charlotte Despard in the Women's Prisoners Defence League. Hanna was also a feminist gadfly among the nationalists, whether in Sinn F&eacute;in or in de Valera's Fianna F&aacute;il&#151;which she decided to join in 1926, only to resign in 1927 in protest against de Valera's agreement to take the oath of loyalty to the Irish Free State. However her feminism could hardly flourish in a Catholic Ireland that forbade women the basic freedoms of access to sex education, contraception, and divorce. She died in Dublin on 20 April 1946 and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery. Many tributes were paid to her warm, even gentle, private personality. She was judged &#145;the ablest of the women&#146; in Irish public life by the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> of 23 April 1946. She had been a militant nationalist among the pacifist internationalist feminists, a republican among the free staters, a feminist among the nationalists, and an atheist in holy Ireland.<br>
