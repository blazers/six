<span class="headword">Comber,  Thomas</span>  (1645&#150;1699), <span class="occ">dean of Durham and liturgist</span>, was born on 19 March 1645 at Westerham, Kent, and baptized at the parish church on 23 March, the fourth of the five children of James Comber (<i>bap</i>. 1615, <i>d</i>. 1671), a member of the Cutlers' Company of London, and his wife, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1617, <i>d</i>. 1672), daughter of Brian Burton, yeoman of Westerham. Apart from Thomas, only his older brother James survived to adulthood, although Mary, a daughter by their mother's first marriage, to Edward Hamden (<i>d</i>. 1639), also survived to maturity. Comber later made great play of the fact that he was the last child to be baptized at Westerham according to the prayer book rite before it was outlawed. His family were royalists: his maternal grandfather had had his property sequestered and his father found it necessary to flee to Flanders, only returning in 1649. These experiences no doubt cast a shadow over the life of the sickly Thomas as he grew up, lending a vividness to the many references to the horrors of the civil war which punctuate his later writings.<br>
<br>At four, when he could barely walk, Comber was sent to a local elementary school, before moving on at six to the Revd Thomas Walter's school in Westerham, where he learned Latin and Greek. From 1653 he alternated between attendance at Sevenoaks grammar school and a school kept by John Evans on Tower Hill, his life being threatened by bouts of severe illness. From 1656 Comber found himself back in the much more congenial care of Walter, with whom he remained until the latter's death in February 1658. He was by then ready to go to university but his admission, to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, was delayed by a year until 18 April 1659, on the advice of William Holland, vicar of Westerham. With the encouragement of his tutor, Edmund Matthews, the senior fellow of the college, Comber's studies at Sidney Sussex were wide ranging, covering scientific subjects as well as music, painting, and oriental languages. But his time at Cambridge was only sustained with the help of a variety of charitable benefactions and, perhaps prematurely discounting his chances of a fellowship, he left in 1663, having graduated BA in January that year.<br>
<br>Comber's academic career may have foundered but his clerical one took off shortly afterwards and continued at a precocious pace. He was ordained deacon on 18 August 1663, aged only eighteen, in order to help out William Holland, who had moved on from Westerham to be rector of All Hallows, Staining, but after barely six weeks, he was on his way to Stonegrave in the North Riding of Yorkshire to serve as curate there, at the behest of the absentee incumbent Gilbert Bennett. The archbishop of York, Richard Sterne, completed Comber's whirlwind induction to the ministry by ordaining him priest on 25 September 1664, an uncanonical move, given his youth, which Sterne, on his own account, never regretted. Even at this early age, Comber was a ready, almost extempore preacher, although his fame was to come from his formidable output as a liturgical writer and Church of England polemicist. Physically Comber was of medium stature, with light brown curly hair and blue eyes.<br>
<br>In March 1665 Comber moved to nearby East Newton Hall, the seat of the Thorntons, a local gentry family to whom he acted as chaplain alongside his parochial duties at Stonegrave. At the end of 1666 he became domestic chaplain to Lord Freschville, a relation of Mrs Thornton, who proved a loyal patron to Comber. He maintained his close relationship with the Thornton family, courting and marrying Alice Thornton (1654&#150;1721) on 17 November 1668, in a secret ceremony at East Newton Hall, in the face of opposition from some members of her wider family; they had four sons and two daughters. In 1669, thanks to his recently acquired patrons, Comber succeeded to the living of Stonegrave on the king's presentation in place of the incumbent, who had been persuaded to resign.<br>
<br>From this secure base Comber now embarked upon his writing career. In the summer of 1672 he published the first part of what was undoubtedly his greatest work, <span class="italic">A Companion to the Temple and the Closet</span>, a detailed commentary on the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> designed to promote its public and private devotional use. It was to prove a massive and enduring monument: the 1841 edition ran to seven volumes, the shortest of which is 366 pages long, and it had a wide readership and influence among clergy and laity within Comber's own lifetime. It was hardly a work of detached scholarship, beginning to appear as it did while Charles II's declaration of indulgence was in force and peppered as it was with polemical asides against both Rome and protestant dissent. Nevertheless, Comber felt it necessary to indulge in more directly polemical works against these twin threats. In 1674 he published anonymously the somewhat inaptly named <span class="italic">Friendly and Seasonable Advice to the Roman Catholics of England</span>, which had its origins in conversations with Lord Fauconberg, whom certain Roman Catholics had been seeking to convert. In 1677 Comber attacked the Quakers in <span class="italic">The Right of Tithes Asserted and Proved from Divine Institution</span> (1677), following this up with a wider attack on Quaker views, as advocated by Thomas Ellwood in <span class="italic">Christianity No Enthusiasm</span> (1678); both were published anonymously.<br>
<br>Partly through his writings and partly through his family connections (Mrs Thornton was a cousin of Lord Treasurer Danby), Comber was looked on with growing favour at court, becoming a prebendary of York in 1677 and a doctor of divinity at Archbishop Sancroft's behest in June 1678. On 11 February 1679 the combined efforts of Danby and lords Freschville and Fauconberg finally secured for Comber the living of Thornton-le-Dale, some 10 miles from Stonegrave, which Sancroft granted him a dispensation to hold in plurality. In April Comber was elected proctor in convocation for the archdeaconry of Cleveland. Finally, in May 1679, he was received at court by Princess Anne, who had read the third part of his <span class="italic">A Companion to the Temple and the Closet</span> in preparation for her first communion (in 1682 she would make him one of her chaplains).<br>
<br>With his court connections and his polemical bent, it is not surprising that Comber should go into print for the tory cause in the exclusion crisis, publishing in the summer of 1681, again anonymously, <span class="italic">Religion and Loyalty Supporting each other</span>, a tract which defended the loyal addresses then flooding into Whitehall and bitterly attacked whig constitutional and historical arguments. Next Comber turned his attention to &#145;the enemy within&#146;&#151;those churchmen who failed to give the Church of England their full support&#151;clashing angrily with Gilbert Burnet on the subject of tithes, both in print and in private correspondence. John Tillotson, a long-standing friend of Comber, was among those who sought to mediate and at least when Comber published the second part of his <span class="italic">Historical Vindication of the Divine Right of Tithes</span> in 1685 it contained no personal references to Burnet, though this owed as much to Dr George Hickes and Dr William Cave as to Tillotson.<br>
<br>In October 1683 Comber was made precentor of York at the behest of John Dolben, the new archbishop, and for the next two and a half years he worked hand in glove with him to reform the minster. According to Dr Henry Watkinson, the chancellor of York diocese, Comber was as good as an extra archdeacon in the place. Dolben's early death in April 1686 and the two-and-a-half year vacancy that followed were blows to Comber, compounding the crisis of James II's abandonment of the tories and promotion of Catholicism. He had a prominent role in the opposition to the king's policies in and around York, in 1688 being ejected from the commission of the peace for his pains. He rallied to the revolution, taking the opportunity to renew his connection with Danby, who acted as godfather to his second son, Thomas, while in York following the seizure of the city. If Comber would have preferred a different constitutional settlement from the one that emerged, he gave no hint of it and very soon set to work defending the new regime in print. Former friends such as Dean Granville of Durham became nonjurors but Comber showed no sign of following them. In fact, Granville's departure gave him a long-looked-for promotion when he succeeded him as dean in 1691, in part thanks to the patronage of Danby (now Carmarthen). Comber was also made chaplain-in-ordinary to William and Mary in 1692.<br>
<br>His twentieth-century editor, Whiting, designates Comber a whig on the basis of his post-1688 career  (Whiting, 2.xii). In his writings Comber certainly moved a long way from his uncompromising toryism of the early 1680s. For example, although he probably did not write <span class="italic">A Letter to a Bishop Concerning the Present Settlement and the New Oaths</span> (1689), in subsequent correspondence he did defend the work, which stated that the crown was one of the three estates in England, a position Comber had roundly rejected in <span class="italic">Religion and Loyalty Supporting each other</span> as leading to rebellion. Nevertheless, many of his former attitudes&#151;his extreme deference for Charles I, his bitter hatred of parliamentarianism, his regard for Charles II, and his suspicion of protestant dissent&#151;survived his change of allegiance intact (as in <span class="italic">A Discourse on the Offices for the Vth November, XXXth January and XXIXth May</span>, 1696; Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 27, fol. 93). Whiting also notes Comber's &#145;diligent search for preferment&#146; throughout his career  (Whiting, 2.x). He was certainly a long-term pluralist (and a self-righteous one at that), who never seemed to be satisfied with what he had and whose cures were not necessarily well served in his absence. Whether he was untypical of the aspiring churchmen of his generation, however, seems open to doubt. Comber died of consumption on 25 November 1699 at East Newton and was buried at Stonegrave parish church, on 30 November.<br>
