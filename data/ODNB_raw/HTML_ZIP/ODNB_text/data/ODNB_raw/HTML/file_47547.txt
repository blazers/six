<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brant,  Joseph</span> <span class="st"> [Thayendanegea]</span>  (1743&#150;1807), <span class="occ">leader of the Mohawk Indians</span>, was born in 1743, probably in March, in or near Cuyahoga (near present-day Akron, Ohio). His parents, Peter Tehowaghwengaraghkwin and Margaret (<i>fl</i>. 1735&#150;1780), were ordinary Mohawks with limited links to the tribe's leading families.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Widowed, Margaret returned to her home at the Canajoharie Mohawk village in New York between 1746 and 1750. She had Joseph baptized there, his Mohawk name translating as &#145;two sticks of wood bound together&#146;. She also remarried, but her new husband died fighting the Catawbas, and in 1753 she married a prominent Mohawk hereditary chief, Brant Canagaraduncka, from whom Joseph took his surname. Through his stepfather, Joseph and his elder sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67083/', "Molly Brant")</script>, came to the attention of the powerful superintendent-general of Indian affairs, Sir William Johnson. Molly became Johnson's common-law wife and an important figure in Mohawk politics.<br>
<br>As a young warrior, Brant fought as one of the British-allied Mohawks in the Seven Years' War. Afterwards, Johnson sent him in 1761 to Moor's Indian Charity School in Lebanon, Connecticut, where he studied under the Revd Eleazar Wheelock. He learned to speak, read, and write English well, and studied such subjects as Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and agriculture, impressing Wheelock as a considerate and modest youth in the process. Both Brant and his patrons assumed that he would undertake further studies and become a missionary, but instead he returned to Canajoharie after only two years at school. As one of Johnson's extended network of Mohawk connections, Brant joined fellow tribesmen during the early stages of the Pontiac War (1763&#150;7) to help the crown suppress the Native nations that had risen against the British.<br>
<br>In 1765 Brant married Neggen Aoghyatonghsera, or Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1771), a young Oneida woman from a prominent family. They had two children, Isaac and Christiana, and enjoyed a comfortable life at Canajoharie. As a product of the colonial middle ground, Joseph supported his family through hunting and fishing as well as by both traditional and European-style farming, and by trading, guiding, and translating for the British Indian department. After Margaret's death, in 1773 Brant, following Mohawk custom, married her half-sister, whose name may have been Susanna. The local Anglican priest thought such a marriage was inappropriate, so a German minister officiated at the wedding. Despite this incident and exposure to dissenting protestantism at school Brant remained a conscientious Anglican; he translated parts of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and other religious texts into Mohawk, although, like many aboriginal Christians, he did not abandon traditional beliefs entirely.<h2>
<a name="TheAmericanWarofIndependence"></a>The American War of Independence</h2>Even though his origins were humble, Brant emerged as a leader among the Mohawks in the late 1760s and early 1770s (with some influence among the Oneidas as well). He advanced because of his own intelligence and energy, his prosperity which attracted a following, his marriages to prominent women, and his ability to serve both his people and the British as a cultural broker.<br>
<br>During this period he struggled to prevent the loss of tribal independence and the unwanted alienation of Mohawk land to settlers who regularly used deceit to acquire coveted aboriginal farms and hunting territories. At one point, unable to gain redress through official channels, a frustrated Brant led twenty warriors to assault one of the most aggressive speculators, George Klock, who, like many of the worst exploiters of Native land rights, supported the revolutionary cause as the thirteen colonies slid towards rebellion.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of hostilities, Brant joined a loyalist and Native force that marched north in May 1775 to guard the approaches to Montreal. During this time, the governor of Quebec, Guy Carleton, promised the Mohawks that they would keep their lands and offered them compensation for any losses they might sustain in fighting for the crown. Carleton's declarations promised to resolve many of Brant's concerns and helped to affirm his loyalty. Nevertheless, his earlier experiences had made him so wary of white ways that he decided to travel to London in late 1775 to seek confirmation and redress for earlier encroachments. Imperial officials offered to fulfil the commitments made in Montreal, providing that the Mohawks remained faithful during the rebellion. While in London Brant became something of a celebrity before leaving for America in June 1776. <i>En route</i>, he fought as a marksman when his ship came under attack from a privateer. He landed on crown-held Staten Island, participated in military operations in that region, and then journeyed back to the Mohawk valley through enemy lines.<br>
<br>There Brant recruited Natives, as well as members of the white and black communities to fight for the crown. Headquartered primarily near Fort Niagara on Lake Ontario &#145;Captain&#146; Brant spent the rest of the war leading his volunteers in operations against the rebels. His objectives were to rescue loyalists and Iroquois (Cayugas, Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Senecas, and Tuscaroras) from rebel-controlled regions, defend Six Nations territory, and deny the revolutionaries the abundant foodstuffs produced on the frontier. Brant's followers, particularly his Natives, also wanted to win the honours and rewards that Iroquois men could earn through combat in a society that valued the warrior spirit.<br>
<br>Despite extensive propaganda to the contrary, Brant was a comparatively humane combatant in the bitter conflict that pitted former neighbours against each other. That propaganda contributed many myths about Brant: claims that he exercised far more control over Iroquois affairs than was possible in Six Nations politics and that he was descended from Mohawk nobility, and claims that portrayed him in pejorative terms, such as &#145;the Monster Brant&#146; of Thomas Campbell's popular 1809 poem <span class="italic">Gertrude of Wyoming</span>.<br>
<br>Some of Brant's many actions included the siege of Fort Stanwix and the battle of Oriskany, as well as raids against numerous settlements, such as Cobbleskill and Cherry Valley. Because the loyalist and Iroquois attacks were so effective, George Washington dispatched a large army in 1779 to destroy Iroquois villages and farms. Brant participated in the failed defence of Iroquoia (modern upstate New York), most notably at the battle of Newtown. The success of the rebel assault forced the majority of Six Nations people to flee west to Fort Niagara, to spend the rest of the war in squalid refugee camps. However, the expedition did not force the pro-crown Iroquois out of the conflict, and war parties, often headed by Brant, continued to inflict death and destruction upon their enemies until 1781.<br>
<br>Brant's second wife died in 1778 or 1779. His third marriage, in 1779, was to Catharine Adonwentishon (<i>d</i>. 1837). The couple were to have seven children: Joseph, Jacob, Margaret, Catharine, Mary, John, and Elizabeth. Catharine's father was the important fur trader and Indian agent George Croghan. Her mother came from a prominent Mohawk family, which allowed Catharine to rise to the status of matron of the Turtle clan, while her half-brother, Henry, succeeded to the important civil and hereditary chieftainship of Tekarihoga at about the time of her marriage. (Joseph belonged to the Wolf clan.) Both Catharine and Henry used their influence to help advance Joseph's ambitions for leadership.<br>
<br>During these years Brant had a farm (at present-day Lewiston, New York), near the Iroquois refugee camps at Niagara, where he kept black slaves and built an Anglican chapel. However, the war took its toll on him, as was shown in 1781 by the first of a growing series of accounts of drunken, brawling behaviour.<h2>
<a name="CanadaandtheOhiocountry"></a>Canada and the Ohio country</h2>The treaty of Paris that ended the American War of Independence left Brant feeling betrayed: Britain failed to address Native objectives, and the border with the new republic was located too far north to protect most aboriginal territory on the frontier&#151;territory that the tribes and loyalists largely controlled at the end of hostilities. Brant declared angrily, &#145;England had Sold the Indians to Congress&#146;  (Allan Maclean, quoting Brant to Frederick Haldimand, 13 May 1783, Haldimand MSS, BL, Add. MS 21763, 2.108). In light of the disaster of 1783, Brant and some other Iroquois leaders decided to resettle in British territory along the Grand River on the north shore of Lake Erie. They chose the Grand because of its proximity to both the predominantly Algonkian nations of the Ohio country and the Senecas of western New York (the most numerous of the Iroquois tribes). Thus, the site held out the promise of fulfilling Brant's new dream, that of forming a confederation of all of the tribes of the lower Great Lakes to defend their lands and interests in the face of anticipated white expansion. In 1784 the British agreed to the move and granted a tract to the Six Nations. By 1785, 1850 people, roughly one-third of the Iroquois in New York, had moved to the Grand. They comprised members of all the Iroquois tribes, along with Delawares and others who had lived among them before the revolution. This was a significant event in Iroquois history, heralding the birth of what would become the largest Six Nations community in the Great Lakes region. It also marked the rise of Brant from being primarily a Mohawk leader to being one with much broader influence among all the Iroquois.<br>
<br>Brant used his personal resources and his influence with crown officials to construct a chapel on the Grand (still extant at the beginning of the twenty-first century), open a school, recruit a physician, and establish a masonic lodge. He also promoted European agricultural practices to improve his people's material well-being and to help them adapt to the erosion of older subsistence patterns. Like some other Six Nations leaders, Brant believed that agricultural prosperity would enable Native society to resist unwanted aspects of white culture and foreign administrative control. Change, however, came slowly because most Iroquois preferred their ancestral ways of living.<br>
<br>Shortly after moving to the Grand, Brant began to worry about the exact nature of the British government's land grant. He had assumed that the large tract had been given in fee simple, thus allowing the tribes to lease or sell superfluous parts of it to generate capital to provide investment income to benefit the Iroquois. However, crown officials argued that the Six Nations only had the right to occupy the land, and therefore were limited to selling their right of occupancy to surplus territory. Furthermore, sales could be made solely to the government, which paid much less for occupancy rights than private speculators might offer for the land itself. Frustrated with the government's attitude and wanting to obtain the compensation promised in Montreal and London in 1775 and 1776, as well as hoping for promises of British military support should the Great Lakes tribes again go to war with the United States, Brant journeyed to England in 1785&#150;6. He obtained the compensation he sought, but failed to resolve the land issue or secure any meaningful military commitment.<br>
<br>Undaunted by his set-backs in London, Brant spent the rest of his life working to change government policies. Many within the Iroquois world mistrusted his motives or did not want to sell land because they hoped to maintain traditional ways of life. Others preferred to have chiefs other than Brant lead the alienation process. Internal Iroquois divisions were aggravated by the aggressive political and diplomatic actions of colonial officials who exploited government restrictions and their personal links to Iroquois leaders to advance the interests of the crown&#151;and sometimes themselves&#151;at the expense of the Six Nations. In desperation, Brant used whatever weapons he could find to achieve his goals. While participating in negotiations with the Americans to address Iroquois concerns within the United States, he made sure that the British knew about his efforts in order to raise doubts about his loyalty and thereby gain concessions. During the mid-1790s, when British officials in Canada were worrying about foreign invasion, he spread rumours that he might join the king's enemies or lead an uprising within British territory. At one point, he took a large war party with him to a meeting with colonial officials in order to intimidate them. While a violent breach was unlikely, Brant correctly thought that threats might prompt officials to make concessions in meeting his wishes to sell and lease land. Rumours and threats were consistent with traditional Iroquois diplomatic practices, and were intended to force other powers to respond to their demands. Nevertheless, they represented a departure for Brant, whose support for the crown had been comparatively forthright until the end of the American War of Independence. The change demonstrated his growing political maturity and his recognition of British willingness to sacrifice the interests of the Six Nations.<br>
<br>South-west of the Grand, the Ohio nations fought the Americans between 1787 and 1794 to preserve their territory against American settlement. Brant and other Six Nations chiefs feared losing their land in New York (and perhaps Canada) if they joined the western tribes in what they assumed would be a doomed struggle without British support. Although deeply distrustful of the United States and willing to fight if necessary, the Iroquois leaders tried to persuade the western tribes to negotiate a boundary acceptable to the Americans. Instead, the western tribes rejected the advice of the Six Nations, were defeated, and lost most of their lands in the disputed region. In the process, Brant's efforts to establish a pan-tribal confederacy collapsed, as did his efforts to reunite the Six Nations, now split by the international border, with the result that Iroquois resident in Canada and America gradually went their separate ways.<br>
<br>In 1795, during the frontier tensions and controversies over land rights, Brant and his son Isaac (who was something of a rogue) got into a fight. Joseph inflicted a knife wound that later became infected. Isaac died and Joseph was plunged into deep, self-recriminating grief. Although the circumstances surrounding the attack are unclear, Joseph's opponents within the Six Nations may have urged Isaac to murder his father. Political assassination by a family member was a traditional way of getting rid of someone, especially a person who had become &#145;too great&#146; in Iroquois minds, and such threats had been made before in Brant's career. Another son, John (Ahyonwaeghs), rose to leadership after 1815, but he was only a little boy at the end of the eighteenth century. Casting about for an able assistant, Brant adopted a mixed Scottish&#150;Cherokee individual, John Norton (Teyoninhokarawen), into the Mohawk tribe in 1798 or 1799 to become a chief and ultimately his successor.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>In 1802 or 1803 Brant left his Grand River home to take up residence at Burlington Bay, Upper Canada, on Lake Ontario, where he lived comfortably in the European style. (While he derived some of his wealth from farming and other enterprises, much of it came from government pensions and land grants as well as presents offered to help maintain the British&#150;Iroquois alliance.) However, he continued to play an active role in Iroquois affairs. On his deathbed in his Burlington home on 24 November 1807, Brant's last words, directed at Norton, were supposedly, &#145;Have pity on the poor Indians: if you can get any influence with the great, endeavor to do them all the good you can&#146;  (Stone, 2.499).<br>
<br>The cause of Brant's death is uncertain, although his health had become frail, partly because of heavy drinking and recurring malaria. He was buried near his Burlington home. His family inherited his two houses, hundreds of acres of land, a government pension, and other assets totalling a substantial legacy by the frontier standards of the time. In 1850, with much ceremony, his remains were reinterred in the graveyard beside the little chapel he had built at Brantford on the Grand River in 1787.<br>
<br>The fundamental challenge faced by the Iroquois in Brant's time was how to resist the ever-constricting limitations on their independence and subsistence patterns as they dropped to a numerically insignificant status in a growing sea of European and American settlers. Earlier in his career Brant strove to address the challenge by earning favour through a vigorous loyalty to the crown in its struggles on the frontier. After the disaster of the American War of Independence, he tried to create new political and economic structures so that his people could exercise as much independence as possible and live comfortably within their changing environment. He also worked to force white officials to live up to the promises and obligations they had made to the Iroquois over the years. Ultimately, he enjoyed only modest successes in holding back unwanted control of Iroquois affairs. Internally, Native politics were too fragmented for one person to muster majority opinion behind any particular political and economic programme, and his modernizing tendencies put him in a minority position in relation to most Six Nations people. Externally, white officials had gained so much power over the Iroquois by the time Brant emerged as a leader that they were well placed to thwart most of the challenges he might pose to them.<br>
