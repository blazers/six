<span class="headword">Macmurray,  John</span>  (1891&#150;1976), <span class="occ">moral philosopher</span>, was born on 16 February 1891 in Maxwellton, near Dumfries, Kirkcudbrightshire, the son of James Macmurray (1854&#150;1933), an excise agent in the civil service, and his wife, Mary Anna Grierson (1867&#150;1973). Following a family move to the north-east of Scotland, Macmurray was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and Robert Gordon College&#151;also in Aberdeen&#151;before proceeding to Glasgow University (1909&#150;13) to read classics. In 1913 he secured a Snell exhibition to study at Balliol College, Oxford, but his philosophical studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of war Macmurray joined the medical corps in October 1914. Two years later, however, concluding that he was part of the British war machine, he enlisted as an officer in the Cameron Highlanders. In 1918 he was wounded in the defence of Arras and awarded the MC. He returned to Oxford as the John Locke scholar and completed his degree course in 1919. He had married, in 1916, Elizabeth Hyde Campbell (1891&#150;1982), an artist from Banchory. As a result of an ectopic pregnancy their marriage was childless.<br>
<br>Macmurray held teaching posts in philosophy at Manchester University (1919&#150;21), Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (1921&#150;2), and Balliol College, Oxford (1923&#150;8) before his appointment in 1928 to the Grote chair of the philosophy of mind and logic at London University. He remained there until 1944, when he returned to Scotland to the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh University, the post from which he retired in 1958.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1930s Macmurray established a reputation as a popular, if controversial, BBC radio broadcaster on cultural, political, and ethical topics. He was regarded as an inspirational teacher, particularly in Edinburgh, where philosophy remained a compulsory subject for all arts students. Although his thought was deeply religious he remained outside institutional Christianity, until in 1958 he and his wife took up residence in the Quaker community at Jordans, Buckinghamshire. They were subsequently received into membership of the Society of Friends, whose pacifism and lack of doctrinal definition attracted Macmurray. They lived and worked in the community at Jordans for ten years before returning to Edinburgh. Macmurray died at his Edinburgh home, 8 Mansionhouse Road, on 21 June 1976 and was survived by his wife. He was cremated at Mortonhall crematorium, Edinburgh, on 25 June, and his remains were interred at the Quaker burial-ground in Jordans.<br>
<br>Several publications arose out of Macmurray's 1930s radio broadcasts, including <span class="italic">Freedom in the Modern World</span> (1932); but his most significant philosophical work were his Gifford lectures, delivered in Glasgow in 1953&#150;4. The two published volumes comprise <span class="italic">The Self as Agent</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">Persons in Relation</span> (1961). He was awarded an LLD degree by Glasgow University in 1954.<br>
<br>Macmurray's sympathy for Marxism, particularly in his writings for the Christian left in the 1930s, derives from the view that material and organic processes must be used for the sake of personal freedom. A just socio-economic order and a classless society are necessary conditions of genuine human community. None the less, Macmurray's early affinity with Marxism did not extend to its radical criticism of religion. While hostile to other-worldly forms of Christianity he insisted that religion can enhance personal life. It exercises a vital social function in uniting persons across national and racial boundaries. It enables people to overcome fear of death and of one another. Fear, not hatred, is the antithesis of love. In this respect, ritual and fellowship are primary in religion; belief and doctrine are secondary. Macmurray was here strongly influenced by Hebraic thought forms over against Roman and Greek traditions. For the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, religion is not a compartment of life. It shapes all of personal, social, and national life. The significance of Jesus resides in his transforming Judaism from a national to a universal religion. His central vision is of the kingdom of God on earth. This regard for Hebrew religion led Macmurray into sharp public criticism of the antisemitism integral to national socialism in the 1930s.<br>
<br>In his Gifford lectures Macmurray's philosophical vision is presented with greater precision. The egocentric and disembodied self of Cartesian thought is roundly attacked. Macmurray substitutes the &#145;I do&#146; for the &#145;I think&#146;. The self is more adequately described in terms of agency than thought. The agent is rooted in a material and social world in which identity is determined relationally. In his analysis of the mother&#150;child relation, Macmurray argues that the child's identity is shaped by the intentions of its mother. Skills are acquired through linguistic communication rather than mere instinct. All experience is thus shared experience, and all existence irreducibly social. The child's well-being is dependent both on the mother's continual love and on her willingness to enable her child to become a free agent. A family is maintained by bonds of mutual affection and friendship between all possible pairs of its members. In this respect it is a model for every society. The task of politics is to apply this model under the conditions of economic and social life.<br>
<br>Macmurray's influence continues to grow, as is evident in the recent reissue of his major publications. His philosophical work can now be seen as one of several twentieth-century protests against the distorting effects of Cartesianism. Although his work was largely ignored by the professional guild of philosophers, the relational and holistic description of the self he presents has attracted the attention of social scientists and theologians. A John Macmurray Society was formed in Canada in 1971 and later superseded by the International John Macmurray Association. In the UK, the John Macmurray Fellowship was formed in 1993. His influence upon a generation of students has been significant, if harder to quantify. Macmurray's relational vision of human society now resonates with late twentieth-century communitarian trends in political thought, while the acknowledged influence on Prime Minister Tony Blair's early political development has brought renewed public attention.<br>
