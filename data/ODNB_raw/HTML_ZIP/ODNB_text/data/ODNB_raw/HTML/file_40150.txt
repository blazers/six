<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rous, Sir  Stanley Ford</span>  (1895&#150;1986), <span class="occ">football referee and administrator</span>, was born on 25 April 1895 in Mutford, Suffolk, the eldest son and third child in the family of two sons and five daughters of Samuel George Rous, provision merchant, and his wife, Alice Coldham. He was educated at the Sir John Leman School, Beccles, and, after opting for a teaching career, at the town's teacher training centre. His passion for football was early apparent when, aged fifteen, he organized a village team. Tall and strongly built, he was an imposing figure in goal and showed considerable ability in local leagues. Watching Norwich play league football he also developed an interest in refereeing.<br>
<br>In the First World War Rous served in France, Palestine, Egypt, and Lebanon, as a non-commissioned officer in the 272nd brigade of the Royal Field Artillery (East Anglian). He acted as a referee in wartime Egypt, after a wrist broken by a shell impaired his playing ability. When demobilized he was attending an officer training centre.<br>
<br>After the war Rous returned to complete his education, going to St Luke's College, Exeter. His football and sporting interests were furthered by his appointment in 1921 as an assistant master at Watford grammar school, where he was in charge of all sport. During his thirteen years at Watford he also became a leading football referee. In 1924 he married Adrienne (<i>d</i>. 1950), daughter of Victor Louis Gacon, silk merchant, originally of Lyons, France, who had a small silk-weaving factory in Hemel Hempstead. She was half German and half French. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1927 Rous was appointed a Football League referee. On 13 March that year he officiated at an international match in Antwerp, the first of thirty-four such games he refereed. In the week in which he submitted his application to succeed Sir Frederick Wall as Football Association secretary he refereed the Welsh cup final on Thursday, the Football Association cup final, in which he used the diagonal refereeing system he had invented, on Saturday, and an international in Antwerp on Sunday.<br>
<br>As secretary of the Football Association from 1934 to 1961 Rous made an immediate impact with his emphasis on training, coaching, and youth football. Firm but charismatic, he was a forceful character, who got his way more by humour and persuasion than reliance on authority. During the Second World War he was released as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery from an anti-aircraft battery to organize sport and raise funds for the Red Cross. He proved an outstanding Football Association secretary, methodical, clear, and well reasoned in his judgements. Always open-minded and progressive, he was conservative only in preserving the essential simplicity of the game and its laws, which he believed to be its main attraction. Indeed, he wrote <span class="italic">A History of the Laws of Association Football</span> (1974). He was responsible for the codification of the laws of the game, redrafting the red and yellow card system for cautions and the linesman's signals. Otherwise he encouraged innovations and improvements, particularly in coaching and refereeing, in a variety of national courses, and in the introduction of floodlighting and of televised football. His close co-operation with the England team manager and director of coaching, Walter Winterbottom, gave both men a worldwide reputation.<br>
<br>Rous's international interest was much in contrast to previous officials' insular outlook. He played a constructive part in England's entry into world cup football in 1950 and in the formation of the European football confederation (UEFA), of which he became a vice-president. He also helped Germany back into international football after the war. His international outlook led to his election in 1961 as president of the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Football Associations (FIFA). Travelling the world and working tirelessly for the game, he made a particular impact on the technical and educational side, which represented his special interest. He wrote a football coaching manual and a book of physical exercises (both 1942). His popularity also played a part in the world cup being awarded to England in 1966. He was defeated when he stood for re-election as president of FIFA in 1974.<br>
<br>Rous's many other contributions to sport in general include being a founder member in 1935 of the Central Council of Physical Recreation, of which he was chairman of the executive committee from 1945 to 1973. Work for the King George's Jubilee Trust, the 1948 Olympic games, the 1951 Festival of Britain, and the duke of Edinburgh's award scheme typified his dedication to his prime concept of &#145;work that others may play&#146;. From 1943 to 1947 he was a member of Paddington borough council and he was a JP in 1950. He held many foreign awards, was appointed CBE in 1943, and was knighted in 1949.<br>
<br>Rous was 6 feet 3 inches tall, with a straight back and distinguished presence that commanded respect, although his clear eyes and husky voice showed a warm-hearted and jovial personality. He died on 18 July 1986 in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, of chronic myelomonocyclic leukaemia. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 25 September 1986.<br>
