<span class="headword">Priestley, Sir  William Overend</span>  (1829&#150;1900), <span class="occ">obstetric physician</span>, was born at Morley Hall, near Leeds, on 24 June 1829, the eldest son of Joseph Priestley and Mary, daughter of James Overend of Morley. He was a great-nephew of Joseph Priestley. Priestley was educated at Leeds, King's College, London, Paris, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1852 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and in 1853 he graduated MD from Edinburgh with a thesis entitled &#145;The development of the gravid uterus&#146;, which was awarded Professor Simpson's gold medal and the senate gold medal for excellence in original work. After graduating Priestley acted as private assistant of Sir James Young Simpson, then went to London and lectured at the Grosvenor Place school of medicine, where he was one of the pioneers of the new science of gynaecology. Following his master, Simpson, he was among the first to convert midwifery into obstetric medicine by attempting to use scientific methods. On 17 April 1856 Priestley married Eliza, the fourth daughter of publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5079/', "Robert Chambers (1802&#150;1871)")</script>; they had two sons and two daughters. Through his wife Priestley came into connection with the Edinburgh intelligentsia and made many influential contacts. His close friends included Louis Pasteur and Oliver Wendell Holmes.<br>
<br>In 1858 Priestley was appointed lecturer in midwifery at the Middlesex Hospital, and in 1862 he was elected professor of midwifery at King's College, London, and obstetric physician to King's College Hospital in the place of Arthur Farre. Priestley suffered a severe attack of diphtheria soon after his election and was absent from his posts for some months. Despite this set-back his future appeared to be brilliant and Priestley's reputation and connections enabled him to build up the largest maternity and gynaecological practice in London. This prevented him from giving sufficient time to his scientific work and in 1872 he resigned from his hospital appointments. As a result, he fell into the background in the London medical establishment. He was appointed consulting obstetric physician to King's College Hospital and became an honorary fellow of King's College and a member of the council but this did not compensate for his loss of clinical status. Though personally respected and liked, Priestley came to be regarded as somewhat reactionary and out-of-date in his own subject. In 1896 he gave evidence in the famous libel case in which his successor at King's, William Playfair, was sued by a patient for breaching medical confidence. Priestley, like other medical witnesses, thought it was in order for a doctor to breach a patient's confidence to protect his own family from contact with an &#145;immoral&#146; woman.<br>
<br>Priestley became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1859 and a fellow in 1864. He was a member of the council from 1878 to 1880, Lumleian lecturer in 1887, and censor in 1891&#150;2. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1858, and from 1866 to 1876 he was an examiner in midwifery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He was also at different times an examiner at the Royal College of Physicians of London and at the universities of Cambridge, London, and Victoria. He was president of the Obstetrical Society of London in 1875&#150;6 and was a vice-president of the Medical Society of Paris. Priestley was a physician accoucheur to Princess Louis of Hesse (Alice of England), and to Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. He received the honorary degree of LLD at the University of Edinburgh in 1884 and was knighted in 1893.<br>
<br>In 1895, in an address to the British Medical Association, Priestley deplored the current craze for &#145;over-operating&#146; in gynaecology. A Conservative and Unionist, in 1896 he was elected to parliament, where he represented the universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews for the rest of his life. He had long been interested in politics but entered parliament too late in his life to have much influence there. He was especially interested in the remodelling of London University from an examining to a teaching body. He also wished to restore the library of the University of Edinburgh but the government refused to give a grant for this. Priestley was taken in ill in December 1899 and in January was moved from his country house in Sussex to London. He died at his home at 17 Hertford Street, Mayfair, London, on 11 April 1900 and was buried on 14 April at St Margaret's, Warnham, near Westbrook Hall, his estate in Sussex. He was survived by his wife.<br>
