<span class="headword">Palairet,  Elias</span>  (1713&#150;1765), <span class="occ">classical and biblical philologist</span>, was born in Rotterdam, of a French family which had taken refuge in the Netherlands following the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. He studied at Leiden, where his first published work, the <span class="italic">Histoire du patriarche Joseph mise en vers h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques</span>, appeared in 1738. After ordination he became in turn preacher at Aardenburg (1741), Doornik (1749), and Tournai (by 1752), before moving to England where he became pastor of the French church at Greenwich (1755) and later of St John's Church, Spitalfields. His first philological work, <span class="italic">Observationes philologico-criticae in sacros Novi Foederis libros</span>, was published in 1752, with the addition of a four-part index for ease of reference, first to the location of scriptural passages, and then in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. Its advertisement hailed the author as a man of rare industry and judgement as well as erudition. Palairet followed this, in 1754, with an eight-page specimen of critical thesaurus of the Greek language and, in 1755, a twenty-four-page pamphlet of philological exercises based on the books of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, intended to precede a revised edition of his <span class="italic">Observationes</span>. In 1756 his <span class="italic">Notes on the New Testament</span> appeared, while his correction of the <span class="italic">Ajax</span> and <span class="italic">Electra</span> of Sophocles, prepared in the same year, was published in 1758. On 8 April 1756 Palairet married Margaret Lefebure at Christ Church, Spitalfields.<br>
<br>Palairet's work rapidly entered mainstream philological debate; several of his arguments from 1752 were refuted in the 1757 <span class="italic">Acta eruditorum Lipsiensium</span>, 451&#150;8, and by Charles-Louis Bauer in his <span class="italic">Stricturarum Periculum</span> (1760), but Palairet returned to the task in 1760 with a study of Latin ellipses based on clear principles of linguistic structure, <span class="italic">Thesaurus ellipsium Latinarum</span>, a work accompanied by a dual index of authors and phrases and regarded as his most useful publication  (<span class="italic">Nouvelle biographie g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</span>). In his preface Palairet promised a second edition, corrected and augmented, of Lambert Bos's <span class="italic">Ellipses Graecae</span> to complement his own work, but this was never completed.<br>
<br>Palairet dedicated the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> to John Egerton, bishop of Bangor and, subsequently, of Durham, whose chaplain he had become after attracting notice with his preaching and pastoral work in London; this is said latterly to have included serving as preacher to the Dutch Chapel at St James's Palace, but there is no formal record of such an appointment in the memorials or admissions entries for the St James's Chapels Royal (TNA: PRO, RG4-4574 and 4575). None the less it is not unlikely that, given his ancestry, linguistic background, and continental experience, which remained defining influences throughout his career in England, he may have preached at the Dutch Chapel or had some connection with it.<br>
<br>Palairet died at Marylebone on 2 January 1765; his philological reputation subsequently declined although Edmund Henry Barker, in the preface to his 1829 new edition of the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>, claimed that Palairet's work, as meritorious and useful as that of other philologists, deserved rescue from scholarly oblivion&#151;an aspiration never wholly fulfilled.<br>
