<span class="headword">Denny, Sir  Maurice Edward</span>, second baronet  (1886&#150;1955), <span class="occ">engineer and shipbuilder</span>, was born at Braehead, Dumbarton, on 11 February 1886, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32785/', "Archibald Denny (1860&#150;1936)")</script> and Margaret Tulloch. Maurice Denny was the third generation of the family in control of shipbuilding at Dumbarton, but, unlike his father and grandfather, did not go to the local school. He was educated first at Tonbridge School, Kent, and then spent two years in Switzerland and one in Germany at the universities of Lausanne and Heidelberg. He then embarked upon an apprenticeship in the firm, combining it in a sandwich course with four years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied naval architecture under Professor C. H. Peabody, graduating with first-class honours as BSc in 1909. This was followed by a further year in the drawing office of Wm Doxford &amp; Sons Ltd, Sunderland, learning about the new diesel engine. On his return to the Leven shipyard in 1911 he became a partner in the business at the age of twenty-four. In 1916 Denny married Marjorie, daughter of William Royse Lysaght, steelmaker, of Castleford, Chepstow, Monmouthshire; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>When the family firm became a limited company in 1918, the two sides of the business, the Leven shipyard of William Denny &amp; Brothers and the marine engineering works of Denny &amp; Co., were united in the single business of Wm Denny &amp; Co.; Maurice Denny was appointed a director. He was elected vice-chairman in 1920, and in 1922 succeeded his uncle, Colonel John M. Denny, as chairman. He was then thirty-six years old and held that office for the next, troubled, thirty years until 1952, when he retired and became president.<br>
<br>Naval architecture, especially in areas of the design, stability, and propulsion of ships, was the consuming interest of the young and technically expert Denny. He co-operated with Charles Parsons in 1911 to produce Dennys' first set of geared turbines, to engine the destroyers <i>Badger</i> and <i>Beaver</i>, the first to be fitted with this type of engine. His experimentation was cut short by the First World War, during which Denny rose to the rank of major in the machine-gun corps in France. However, on account of the pressure on shipbuilding, and his experience, he was recalled to take up the post of deputy director of designs under the controller-general for merchant shipbuilding at the Admiralty, and was appointed CBE in 1918.<br>
<br>After the war Denny was keen to apply his scientific brain and well-trained mind to the many shipbuilding problems, but there was a deep depression in world trade, and the need for rigid economies had to have priority. But even in these very difficult years he enhanced his company's reputation, particularly in the construction of fast cross-channel ships with turbine propulsion. He also developed a &#145;vane-wheel&#146; system for powering flat-bottomed riverboats, and produced two types of torsion meters, the Denny-Johnstone and the Denny-Edgecumbe. His company also built the first all-welded ship in Scotland in 1934, the <i>Robert the Bruce</i>, which was in addition the first diesel&#150;electric paddler constructed in Britain. Even more significant was his collaboration with William Wallace (1881&#150;1963) of Brown Brothers to produce the Denny-Brown stabilizer. This was first fitted extensively during the Second World War to give greater stability for gunnery. After the war it was widely used in ships all over the world.<br>
<br>Denny made a lasting contribution to the progress of the industry, particularly in promoting research. He became chairman of the Shipbuilding Conference in 1940, and also served on the advisory committee on merchant shipbuilding, working closely with Sir Henry Lithgow in co-ordinating the shipbuilders' work during the war. In spite of heavy demands on his time he was instrumental in the foundation of the British Shipbuilding Research Association in 1944; and he was a member of its research council and served as chairman of its research board from its inception until his death. It was largely due to his driving force that the <i>Lucy Ashton</i> trials to measure the power and speed of ships were carried out. The modification of this old Clyde paddle-steamer, fitted with four jet engines, permitted full-scale self-propelled experiments, delivering valuable hydrodynamic data. His services in administration during the war earned him the KBE in 1946.<br>
<br>Among many appointments, Denny was chairman of the technical committee of the British Corporation Register of Shipping and Aircraft, the Glasgow-based registration company, which was eventually amalgamated with Lloyd's Register. He also played a prominent role in the Air Registration Board, being chairman for many years. On Clydeside he was president of the Clyde Shipbuilders' Association, and nationally the president of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation. He was a valued supporter of many of the professional institutions and notably president in 1935 of the Institute of Marine Engineers, as his father and grandfather had been. He received an honorary LLD from Glasgow in 1949. Denny's business interests also involved him in many directorships, notably of shipping companies, mainly the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, the India General Navigation and Railway Company, and the British and Burmese Steam Navigation Company. He was also a director of the Union Bank of Scotland, of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, and of Lloyds British Testing Company.<br>
<br>In his approach to his business Denny was driven by a meticulous integrity, which was the outstanding quality of his character. He was a man of wide interests, and a witty and genial personality. He found his recreation in country life&#151;he was a golfer, a keen gardener, and an ornithologist of wide knowledge with an almost complete egg collection of birds of the British Isles. In ship model-making he was a skilled craftsman and he presented to the Science Museum his handmade model of the <i>Cutty Sark</i>, a famous clipper ship completed by Denny Brothers. Following a coronary thrombosis, Denny died at Drymen, Stirlingshire, on 2 February 1955. His eldest son, Alistair Maurice Archibald Denny, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
