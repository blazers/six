<span class="headword">Kennedy,  John</span>, fifth earl of Cassillis  (1574/5&#150;1615), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born in Ayrshire between October 1574 and April 1575, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15369/', "Gilbert Kennedy, fourth earl of Cassillis (c.1541&#150;1576)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1545&#150;1626), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17277/', "John Lyon, seventh Lord Glamis (b. c.1521, d. in or before 1559)")</script>. His father dying while he was still a small child, he was placed under the tutorship first of his uncle, John Lyon, eighth Lord Glamis (<i>c</i>.1544&#150;1579), and then of his paternal uncle, Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean. In 1597 he married (by contract dated 4 November 1597) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69902/', "Lady Jean Fleming (1553/4&#150;1609)")</script>, daughter and heir of James Fleming, fourth Lord Fleming, and widow of John Maitland of Thirlestane, former chancellor. Almost immediately, probably because of her influence at court, he became involved in national politics, being recorded on a sederunt of the privy council in January 1598 and attending conventions of the estates in June and December. In April 1599 he was appointed, through his wife's influence, lord high treasurer to James VI. He was reluctant to accept this office, the privy council charging him on 11 April to come to Edinburgh to take up his duties. Six days later, Kennedy of Culzean appeared before the council in his stead to accept the office formally on the demission of its former holder. Within a few weeks he resigned, already 40,000 merks (&pound;26,666 Scots) out of pocket.<br>
<br>Cassillis was party to the murder in Ayrshire in December 1601 of Gilbert Kennedy of Bargany, in revenge for Bargany's attempt on Cassillis's life in an ambush. In the following May, Kennedy of Culzean was murdered by Bargany's brother and, in 1603, while the earl was in England with James VI, his wife and brother were seized by Bargany's kinsmen because his killer was in their company. Although Cassillis returned on hearing of this outrage, he had little affection for his wife. On 1 November 1604, he was charged to enter Blackness Castle &#145;for preissing, in presens of the Counsall, to have violentlie tane his wife furth of the counsalhous&#146; during a meeting of the privy council  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 7.16). They were in dispute over the laird of Clerkington's lease of the &#145;place of Lethington&#146; (now Lennoxlove), Haddingtonshire, which belonged to the countess and which Cassillis was accused of &#145;violentlie takking and deteaning&#146;. A few weeks later, the king having commended the countess to the care of the privy council, Cassillis had to enter surety of &pound;5000 Scots and was ordered to remain west of Linlithgow  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 7.580). On 23 June 1609 the countess died, aged fifty-five, the marriage having produced no children.<br>
<br>Cassillis remained active, attending conventions of the estates in 1608 and 1609 and regularly appearing on the privy council. In November 1610 he was made a justice of the peace in Wigtownshire and Kirkcudbright, and in Ayrshire. He was also involved in ecclesiastical affairs, attending the general assembly at Linlithgow in December 1606 and being appointed to the court of high commission under the archbishop of Glasgow in March 1610. His last recorded attendance on the privy council was in March 1615 and he died in October 1615. His nephew John Kennedy (1595&#150;1668) succeeded as sixth earl of Cassillis.<br>
