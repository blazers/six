<span class="headword">Murchison <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hugonin]</span>,  Charlotte</span>, Lady Murchison  (1788&#150;1869), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born, according to the inscription on her tombstone, on 18 April 1788, probably in the family's home, Nursted House, near Petersfield, Hampshire, one of at least three children of General Francis Hugonin (<i>d</i>. 1836) and his wife, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1838), daughter of Mileson and Elizabeth Edgar. Nothing is known of her childhood or youth.<br>
<br>In early summer 1815 Charlotte Hugonin met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19555/', "Roderick Impey Murchison (1792&#150;1871)")</script>; she married him on 29 August 1815 in the church of Buriton in Hampshire. They had no children, but a daughter of Roderick's brother lived with them for some years. From 1816 to 1818 the Murchisons toured the continent. It is likely the tour was Charlotte's idea, an attempt to curb her husband's spending and to interest him in intellectual pursuits. They travelled through Italy, visiting Genoa, Naples, and Rome, where they became acquainted with Mary Somerville (1780&#150;1872), the scientific writer, who became a lifelong friend. It was also in Rome that Charlotte caught a malarian fever that nearly caused her death, and whose symptoms returned at intervals all through her life. After returning to England in 1818 the Murchisons lived at Barnard Castle, co. Durham, at the house of Charlotte's late grandfather. In 1820 or 1821 they moved to Melton Mowbray where Roderick Murchison dedicated himself to fox-hunting. Charlotte constantly tried to interest him in more intellectual pursuits, and finally succeeded in 1824, aided by Humphry Davy (1778&#150;1829) and by financial problems. The couple moved to London, and Roderick Murchison began to attend lectures on geology and chemistry.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1825 the Murchisons undertook geological fieldwork along the south coast of England, with Charlotte collecting fossils and sketching the outcrops along the coast. In Lyme Regis she went fossil-hunting with the palaeontologist Mary Anning (1799&#150;1847); the two women became good friends and soon established a frequent correspondence. The following year the Murchisons undertook fieldwork in Yorkshire and the Hebrides. Charlotte carried out the actual fossil-hunting, and collected many specimens which Sowerby (1788&#150;1871) later described in the <span class="italic">Mineral Conchology of Great Britain</span> (1812&#150;34). She also made many sketches of outcrops and fossils. Sowerby named one of the cephalopods <i>Ammonites murchisonae</i> &#145;as a just tribute for the ardour with which [Mrs Murchison] has pursued the study of fossil conchology, the pleasing effects of which those who are so happy as to be acquainted with her know how to appreciate&#146;  (Sowerby, 6.96). Other palaeontologists including William Buckland (1784&#150;1856) used Charlotte's collection of fossils for their work. In 1828 Charlotte accompanied her husband and Charles Lyell (1797&#150;1875) to the Auvergne region of France and to northern Italy. Again she participated actively in the expedition, and Lyell esteemed her as &#145;an invaluable assistant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life, Letters, and Journals</span>, 184). Two years later the Murchisons were exploring Germany and the Alps. From the early 1830s until 1838, Roderick Murchison worked on greywacke deposits in Wales, and again Charlotte was frequently at his side. A number of her sketches are reproduced in her husband's <span class="italic">The Silurian System</span> (1839).<br>
<br>On her mother's death in 1838 Charlotte Murchison inherited a fortune, and this enabled the couple to move in 1840 to fashionable Belgrave Square. Their soir&eacute;es there became an important meeting place for scientists and politicians, and their success was mainly due to Charlotte's social abilities. However, as the years passed, her health became steadily worse. She was unable to accompany her husband to Russia, although in 1847 they both travelled in the Alps and Italy, combining science and the therapeutic benefits of a better climate. In time Charlotte was confined to her home, although it appears she still participated mentally in her husband's work and advised him in his scientific activities, and was probably able to visit people in the locality. After a prolonged phase of feeble health, Charlotte Murchison died from bronchitis at her home, 16 Belgrave Square, on 9 February 1869; she was buried at Brompton cemetery, London, on 13 February.<br>
<br>Whereas contemporaries knew and cherished her influence and abilities, she later became considered a mere appendage to her husband. However, without her Roderick Murchison would have never been a geologist. As Mary Somerville said:<blockquote>Mrs Murchison was an amiable accomplished woman, drew prettily and what was rare at the time she had studied science, especially geology and it was chiefly owing to her example that her husband turned his mind to those pursuits in which he afterwards obtained such distinction. (Patterson, 29)</blockquote>It was she who introduced him into the geological world, and it was her money and social position which helped him achieve such extraordinary prominence within it (he was knighted in 1846 and made baronet in 1866). She took an active part in the scientific pursuits which she had initiated, and her views are intimately connected with Roderick Murchison's work. Charlotte Murchison also played a role in making higher education accessible to women: in 1831 it was her wish to attend Lyell's geological lectures at King's College that caused them to be opened to both sexes.<br>
