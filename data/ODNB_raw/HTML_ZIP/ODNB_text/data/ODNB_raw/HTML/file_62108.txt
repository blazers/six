<span class="headword">Butler,  Kathleen Teresa Blake</span>  (1883&#150;1950), <span class="occ">Italian scholar</span>, was born at Bayview, Bardsea, Urwick, Lancashire, on 26 September 1883, the eldest of the four daughters and three sons of Theobald Fitzwalter Butler (1845&#150;1914), iron merchant, deputy lieutenant for Lancashire, and mayor of Barrow in Furness (1906&#150;11), and his wife, Catherine Elizabeth Barraclough (<i>d</i>. 1946). She was proud of her descent from a Norman baron in Ireland in the twelfth century and revelled in stories of her ancestors' wild exploits. Her father took an enthusiastic interest in the languages and cultures of the countries he visited, both for business and on family holidays. Most of his children were educated abroad. Kathleen began with a Norwegian governess. At the age of fourteen she moved on to schools in Hanover, Saxony, and Paris. In 1907 she entered Cambridge Training College for Women and taught at Stamford high school for a year. She then became a student at Newnham College, Cambridge (1909&#150;13), following her younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40924/', "Eliza Marian Butler")</script>. Here her exceptional intellectual qualities were quickly recognized by her dons, but she made her friends among the less intellectual students, who are said to have envied greatly her green silk tartan stockings from Paris.<br>
<br>From Newnham, where she gained a first in the medieval and modern languages tripos (French and German) in 1911 and a second in 1913 (Italian and Romance philology), Butler went straight to a lectureship in French at Royal Holloway College and again made her mark with her red hair, emerald green jacket, and small scholarly handwriting. It was said of her that she had no time for students who would not think but much patience with those who could not. Girton College, Cambridge, claimed her in 1915 as director of studies in modern languages, a post she held for twenty-three years. She soon became known among her new colleagues as Blazing Butler, the redhead whose impatience with bureaucracy and rigid rules was liable to boil over at staff meetings: a tendency which her professionalism and sense of duty tamed over the years, making her an excellent and restrained chairman. Her prodigious capacity for work was boosted by her ability to catnap. She created a fellows' garden at Girton and for many years served with her friend Lady Stephen on the curators' committee of the college, where her flair for flower arranging and interior decorating contributed much to the new fellows' rooms built in 1932.<br>
<br>From 1926, when Cambridge opened its lectureships to women, until 1948 Butler was university lecturer in Italian. In 1919 and 1935 she organized a summer school for Italian studies. She helped to found the journal <span class="italic">Italian Studies</span> (1937) and chaired the Italian committee of the Modern Languages Association for many years. Her scholarly works included <span class="italic">A History of French Literature</span> (2 vols., 1923) and, jointly with her Girton colleague Henriette Bibas, <span class="italic">Les premi&egrave;res lettres de Guez de Balzac, 1618&#150;27</span> (2 vols., 1933&#150;4). She was joint editor with Barbara Reynolds of <span class="italic">Tredici novelle moderne</span> (1947).<br>
<br>In 1942 Butler was elected mistress of Girton. At the vice-chancellor's request, she postponed her retirement to pilot through the measure by which, in 1948, Cambridge finally conceded to women full membership of the university. KTB, as she was affectionately known, took great and deserved delight in representing the college at this time, particularly when the queen, later the queen mother, the college visitor, came up in October 1948 to receive an honorary doctorate, the first woman to be so honoured by Cambridge. Kathleen Butler died from renal failure in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 2 May 1950. Between bouts of pain she had worked for months to complete her final work: <span class="italic">&#145;The Gentlest Art&#146; in Renaissance Italy: an Anthology of Italian Letters, 1459&#150;1600</span> (published posthumously in 1954). She was buried in Girton churchyard, Cambridgeshire, on 8 May.<br>
