<span class="headword">Boyle <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gordon]</span>,  Eleanor Vere Crombie</span>  (1825&#150;1916), <span class="occ">illustrator and author</span>, was born on 1 May 1825 at Auchlunies, Kincardineshire, the youngest of the nine children of Alexander Gordon (1783&#150;1873) of Auchlunies and his wife, Albinia Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cumberland. Her father was the illegitimate son of George Gordon, third earl of Aberdeen, and his mistress Penelope Dering. Her mother's parents were Richard Cumberland, army officer, and Lady Albinia, daughter of George Hobart, third earl of Buckinghamshire. Her mother was an amateur painter. Her early childhood was spent at Auchlunies and she was educated at home. She often visited Maryculter, the seat of her father's cousin William Gordon, in the nearby valley, and even after the family moved to Hampton Wick in 1833 they frequently travelled north, particularly to Ellon Castle, Aberdeenshire, which her father inherited in 1840. She also went regularly to Hampton Court, where her grandmother, Lady Albinia Cumberland (formerly maid of honour to Queen Charlotte, wife of George III), occupied grace-and-favour apartments.<br>
<br>On 23 September 1845, at a ceremony in St George's Hanover Square, Eleanor Gordon married the Hon. and Revd Richard Cavendish Townshend Boyle (1812&#150;1886), the youngest son of Edmund, eighth earl of Cork and Orrery. Her husband was rector of Marston Bigot, Somerset, and in 1847 became chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria. They lived at Marston rectory, Marston Bigot, at that time a remote and old-fashioned area, spending their holidays in Switzerland, the south of France, and Italy. The first of their five children was born in 1846, the fifth and last in 1854.<br>
<br>Although Boyle undoubtedly received art instruction as a child, it was not until the birth of her own children that she developed her talent&#151;under the influence of the works of Albrecht D&uuml;rer, the Pre-Raphaelites, and John Ruskin's <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span>, and with the benefit of informal advice from William Boxall, Charles Eastlake, and Thomas Landseer; Landseer taught her to etch. Boyle was known professionally as E. V. B. or the Hon. Mrs Richard Boyle, only rarely acknowledging her third forename, or signing as Eleanor Vere Boyle. Between 1852 and 1877 she illustrated fourteen books, the majority fairy tales or nursery rhymes. <span class="italic">Child's Play</span> (1852) with seventeen drawings (the first time nursery rhymes had been illustrated) and <span class="italic">A Children's Summer</span> (1853) with eleven etchings on steel by the artist (illustrating prose by her husband's cousin, Mary Boyle, and verse by W. M. Call) won praise from John Ruskin, Thomas Landseer, Tom Taylor, and Francis Turner Palgrave, and led to the suggestion that she should be included, with Lady Waterford, in John Millais's sketching club project of 1854. There followed <span class="italic">Waifs and Strays from a Scrap-Book</span> (1862), <span class="italic">Woodland Gossip</span> (1864), <span class="italic">A Leaflet from a German Christmas Tree</span> (1865), <span class="italic">In the Fir Wood</span> (1866), <span class="italic">The Story without an End</span> (1868), <span class="italic">A Dream Book</span> (1870), a new translation of Hans Christian Andersen's <span class="italic">Fairy Tales</span> (1872), <span class="italic">Beauty and the Beast</span> (1875), <span class="italic">The Magic Valley, or, Patient Antoine</span> by Eliza Keary (1877), and <span class="italic">A New Child's Play</span> (1877). She also illustrated Thomas Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</span> (for <span class="italic">Favourite English Poems</span> published by Sampson Low in 1859) and Lord Tennyson's <span class="italic">May Queen</span> (1861). Idealized children, often in mysterious natural surroundings with meticulously rendered plants and animals, predominate in her illustrations, most of which, from the 1860s, were reproduced photographically and some subsequently printed in colour. Boyle also exhibited fourteen designs for illustrations and independent works at the Society of Female Artists (Society of Lady Artists from 1869) (1859&#150;79), five at watercolour exhibitions of the Dudley Gallery (1872&#150;80), thirteen at the latter's black and white exhibitions (1877&#150;80), and three at the Grosvenor Gallery (1880, 1881). Constantly involved with charitable work in her husband's parish, Eleanor Boyle often used the proceeds from her sales and publications for good causes: she financed the provision of fresh drinking water in Lower Marston and refurbished her husband's church.<br>
<br>About 1871, on Richard Boyle's retirement, the family moved to Huntercombe Manor, near Burnham in Buckinghamshire, where Boyle re-created the extensive garden, planting roses on a large scale and 20,000 snowdrops. From 1878, when her husband suffered a stroke, Boyle's artistic output lessened considerably and she devoted herself to writing. Nature, gardens, and what she called &#145;the day of small things, of Nature's delicate masterpieces&#146;  (E. V. Boyle, <span class="italic">The Peacock's Pleasaunce</span>, 1908, 92) were her main subjects in ten books published between 1884 and 1908, many illustrated with small black and white vignettes. <span class="italic">Days and Hours in a Garden</span>, dedicated to her husband, who died in 1886, was her most popular work, ten editions appearing between 1884 and 1898. Also successful were <span class="italic">Ros rosarum ex horta poetarum</span> (1885), an anthology of poetry about roses to which Tennyson and Bulwer-Lytton contributed verses, and <span class="italic">Seven Gardens and a Palace</span> (3rd edn, 1900)&#151;a collection of essays by Eleanor Boyle reprinted from the <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Review</span>, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</span>&#151;describing gardens she had known since her childhood. She presented a copy of this last work to her friend Queen Alexandra.<br>
<br>Boyle's views on art were also published. A patroness of the Frome School of Art since its foundation in 1868, she twice addressed its students (in 1870 and 1899), encouraging a &#145;patient following of Nature for love of Nature's truth&#146; and education of &#145;the perception of beauty&#146; while decrying impressionism and the &#145;profoundly joyless&#146; art inspired by Burne-Jones  (E. V. Boyle, <span class="italic">The Peacock's Pleasaunce</span>, 1908, 249, 258, 253). She herself continued to sketch; in 1902 an exhibition was held of her work entitled &#145;Sketches, dreams and drawings&#146; at Leighton House, Kensington, London. Her last work, drawn for Tennyson in 1911, was <span class="italic">Love hath us in the Net</span>.<br>
<br>Much of Eleanor Boyle's considerable wealth having been lost as a result of unwise investments by her son-in-law, a banker (to whom her fortune was entrusted after the death of her husband), her old age was spent in comparative poverty. She died at Prestwood Dyke Road, Brighton, on 29 July 1916 and was buried in Marston Bigot churchyard.<br>
