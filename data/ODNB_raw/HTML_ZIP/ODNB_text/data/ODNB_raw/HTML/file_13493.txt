<span class="headword">Holden,  Lawrence</span>  (1710&#150;1778), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and author</span>, was born at Bolton-le-Moors, Lancashire, probably the son of John Holden, and might have been baptized at Bolton-le-Moors on 14 January 1711. He was educated for the ministry at Warrington under Charles Owen and commenced his ministerial career about 1732 at Whitworth, Lancashire, moving to Doncaster in 1735 and finally to Maldon, Essex, in 1740, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Holden was a rational dissenter whose beliefs evolved through Arianism into the adoption of unitarian principles, and &#145;he had not the smallest tincture of Calvinistic divinity about him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 1806, 561&#150;3). His theological views were considered advanced in Maldon, and there was opposition from the parish church to the school which he ran. &#145;He was possessed of learning but his style was remarkably diffuse &hellip; he appears to have been a very amiable man though not a popular preacher&#146;  (Burls, 22). His amiability did not prevent a split in the congregation arising over his theology, the seceders opening a separate place of worship in 1765. At his death the original congregation disappeared, and the seceders moved back into the old building the following year. Holden's chief works were paraphrases of books of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. <span class="italic">A Paraphrase of the Books of Job, Psalms, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes</span>, published in 1763, was widely quoted among dissenters, with <span class="italic">A Paraphrase on Isaiah</span> following in 1776.<br>
<br>Holden married, first, a daughter of Mr A. Whitworth in the 1720s and, second, between 1736 and 1740, a daughter of John Slack of Long Elmsel, West Riding; she died on 7 January 1808 aged eighty-five. He died on 5 August 1778 at Maldon of a bladder disorder. His son by his second marriage, <a name="cosubject_13493"></a><span class="headword">Lawrence Holden</span>  (1752&#150;1844), also a <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister but later a Unitarian minister</span>, was born at Maldon on 17 December 1752. He took over his father's theological position and developed it over a long life. In 1766 he entered Hoxton Academy, which while orthodox in foundation provided the basis for his future thinking: &#145;almost all the students were against me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, 780&#150;83). He was much influenced while at the academy by Caleb Fleming, whose biography he later edited.<br>
<br>Holden was appointed assistant minister at the Presbyterian meeting-house at Tenterden, Kent, in July 1772 at the age of nineteen (&#145;the laying on of hands I considered an absurdity&#146;; <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, 782), and was still the nominal minister when he died aged ninety-one. A ministry of nearly seventy-two years is a remarkable feat of endurance, though he played only a very limited part in preaching after the appointment of Edward Talbot as a co-minister in 1827. In January 1777 he married Mary, a daughter of James Blackmore; she died in 1809. Longevity and his strong views made him a well-known figure among dissenters, and he was rightly considered by Edward Talbot as &#145;the father and apostle of Unitarianism in Kent&#146;  (ibid., 780). He died at Tenterden on 19 March 1844 and was buried in the burial-ground of the meeting-house he had served for so long on 26 March.<br>
