<span class="headword">Urquhart,  Mary Sinclair <span class="st"> [Molly]</span></span>  (1906&#150;1977), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Glasgow on 21 January 1906, the eldest of the family of three daughters and a son of William Urquhart (1875&#150;1956), ship's engineer, and his wife, Ann McCallum (<i>b</i>. 1874), a Post Office clerk. Both parents had moved from the highlands to work in Glasgow, where they married. The family lived at 27 Caird Drive, Dowanhill, and attended Gardner Street Presbyterian Church.<br>
<br>Mary was a lively child who took delight in singing round the piano and learning highland dancing to her father's chanter. Her party piece was &#145;Cockles and mussels&#146;, telling the sad tale of Molly Malone, and she became known as Molly from then on. She attended Dowanhill primary school and Church Street School, leaving at fourteen to work in the civil service in the telephone exchange. Her abiding passion was still acting and she saved her money to pay for elocution lessons from a renowned teacher, Percival Steeds at the Athenaeum in Glasgow. At sixteen she joined a local drama club and by her twenties she had become an accomplished amateur. Her work attracted the attention of R. F. Pollock, a Glasgow businessman with a real passion for theatre. Inspired by Theodore Komisarjevsky's Chekhov season in London in 1926, he chose a group of players, gave each actor a meticulously annotated script of <span class="italic">The Three Sisters</span>, and rehearsed them for ten weeks. Urquhart played the part of Irena. The play was presented for a week's private performances and received admiring reviews.<br>
<br>In 1934 Urquhart made her professional d&eacute;but in Glasgow's Theatre Royal, playing Effie Deans in a roistering stage version of Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Heart of Midlothian</span>, directed by Millard Shevlin. She used her full name, Mary S. Urquhart. During this time she became engaged to William McIntosh (1900&#150;1959) from Inverness-shire, a member of the Glasgow police force. He totally understood that acting was essential to her happiness, and they married on 1 August 1934. In 1935&#150;6 Molly worked with the Cambridge Festival Theatre, then in 1936&#150;7 with the Sheldon-Browne company in Gourock. She gained valuable experience from these engagements but realized that in order to work in Scotland she would have to find a theatre space and form her own company.<br>
<br>Urquhart found a suitable building in Rutherglen, a small royal burgh outside Glasgow. A disused church, it had a square interior with pews seating about 250 people. John Paterson, founder of a famous oatcake firm, was the owner. Impressed that Urquhart had saved &pound;300 towards the venture, more than he had when he started, he rented the building to her for a nominal figure. The theatre was to be called the MSU (after her initials). She saw this as a place where young amateur actors who wanted to become professional could gain experience. She planned a season of weekly repertory, and all of her company rehearsed in the evenings after their day's work was done. Her family and friends helped in every way, adapting the building and making scenery and costumes. One day, as she took off her overalls and put on some make-up to meet the press, someone quipped, &#145;Star by night, char by day&#146;  (Murdoch, 65). The play chosen for the opening was Merton Hodge's <span class="italic">The Wind and the Rain</span>, an entertaining story of student life. The leading roles were played by Eileen Herlie, Andrew Crawford, and Archie Duncan, with Molly directing and playing the landlady.<br>
<br>The people of Rutherglen rallied round the theatre and after a successful opening night on 2 May 1939, audiences grew steadily. Her husband took the accounts in hand, and with the support of the company on stage, backstage, and in the box office, Urquhart ran the theatre until 1944, in spite of the war, the black-out, and the lack of any public subsidy. However, she did allow herself a few weeks off in September 1943 for the birth of her son, James Urquhart McIntosh. Over 100 plays were presented in the theatre, from G. B. Shaw to James Bridie, and with several modern comedies, pantomimes, and new plays by Scottish dramatists. Actors who gained experience on that little stage included Duncan Macrae, Gordon Jackson, and the young Nicholas Parsons, who said of Molly: &#145;She gave us real experience of walking the boards, learning one's job the hard, the only way&#146;  (Murdoch, 122&#150;3).<br>
<br>In 1944 when the Paterson family decided to sell the building for &pound;2000 Molly had to accept that the price was beyond her means. The little theatre in its five brief years had been an important chapter in Scottish dramatic history. However, Molly Urquhart was invited to join a new venture, the Citizens' Theatre, established in Glasgow by James Bridie. Her first part was the lead in J. B. Priestley's <span class="italic">Bull Market</span>, a comedy about a chambermaid who became a millionaire. Translating the dialogue from Yorkshire to Scots she gave a triumphant performance, in the central role, described by the author as &#145;truly magnificent and vital&#146;  (Murdoch, 130). Urquhart became a permanent member of the Citizens' Company and worked there, on and off, from 1944 to 1957. She was supremely happy, especially when she got parts that allowed her to give full rein to her very Scottish style of acting. These included Mrs Grant in Bridie's <span class="italic">The Forrigan Reel</span>, Mary Paterson in <span class="italic">The Anatomist</span> (also by Bridie), and Dame Sensualitie in David Lindsay's <span class="italic">The Thrie Estaitis</span> at the Edinburgh festival. In this last she was magnificent: beautifully gowned, she advanced into the assembly halls and made the old Scots words ring out with warmth and humour. In Bridie's pantomime <span class="italic">The Tintock Cup</span> she played a redoubtable principal boy, stopping the show with a song written by Stanley Baxter, &#145;Tatty Bacchante&#151;I'm everyone's auntie&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1945 Molly Urquhart's first London appearance was in James Bridie's <span class="italic">The Forrigan Reel</span> in Sadler's Wells. The company was headed by Alistair Sim, with whom she again appeared in Bridie's <span class="italic">Dr. Angelus</span> (Phoenix Theatre, 1947) and <span class="italic">The Anatomist</span> (Westminster Theatre, 1948). Her inclusion in <span class="italic">Who's Who in the Theatre</span> followed in 1951.<br>
<br>In 1957 Molly Urquhart appeared in <span class="italic">The Nun's Story</span>, a film by Fred Zinnemann; she also had roles in several of his later films, including <span class="italic">A Man for All Seasons</span> (1966). She had made the acquaintance of Dame Peggy Ashcroft in <span class="italic">The Nun's Story</span> and she was invited to join her in a play called <span class="italic">The Coast of Coromandel</span>. During rehearsals she got word, on 9 January 1959, that her husband had suffered an aneurism while at the wheel of his car and had died instantly. Now a widow with a sixteen-year-old son, Molly Urquhart subsequently undertook television and film work whenever possible. She played in <span class="italic">The Flying Swan</span>, a television series with Margaret Lockwood, and <span class="italic">The Very Merry Widow</span> with Moira Lister, taking the part of a Scottish housekeeper in both series. In 1962 she appeared in the Sean O'Casey season at the Mermaid Theatre and also worked in a series of Scottish comedies with Jimmy Logan in his New Metropole Theatre in Glasgow.<br>
<br>In her latter years Molly Urquhart continued her lifelong residence in Glasgow, and spent as much time as possible with her family in Wester Ross and on Loch Lomondside. Shortly after she made her final appearance in Fred Zinnemann's film of <span class="italic">Julia</span> in 1977, she became ill and, following an operation for cancer, died in the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, on 5 October 1977. She was buried in Arrochar churchyard, Loch Long. She was a lady at the heart of Scottish theatre and an inspiration to many young actors. Perhaps Dame Peggy Ashcroft summed up her essential spirit: &#145;She was like the sun coming into the room&#146;  (Murdoch, 243).<br>
