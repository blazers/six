<span class="headword">Vere <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tracy; <em>other married name </em>Hoby]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Vere  (1581&#150;1671), <span class="occ">gentlewoman and patron of ministers</span>, was born on 18 May 1581, the youngest daughter of Sir John Tracy (<i>d</i>. 1591) of Toddington, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Ann Throckmorton. Her mother died three days later. When she was nineteen Mary married William Hoby (<i>d</i>. 1602?) of Hailes, Gloucestershire; during a brief marriage they had two sons, Philip (<i>d</i>. 1617) and William (<i>d</i>. 1623). In November 1607 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28211/', "Sir Horace Vere")</script>, from 1625 Baron Vere of Tilbury (1565&#150;1635). Vere had already established his military reputation in the Dutch wars against Spain and later served as governor of the cautionary town of Brill between 1609 and 1616. In the early 1620s he commanded the English volunteer force in the palatinate. The couple became strongly associated with the international Calvinist cause. While he was on campaign Vere supplied his wife with continental news about the wars, which she circulated to other members of her family. Lady Vere's interest in news continued after his death in 1635, and in 1637 she informed Sir Ferdinando Fairfax of a Swedish victory against imperial forces, which she observed &#145;will hinder the Emperor's design to send forces against the Low Countries&#146;  (Johnson, 1.313). Vere's death left her &#145;indebted&#146;, although she was the main beneficiary as well as the executor of his will. Nevertheless, in 1635 Lady Vere still hoped to raise dowries of between &pound;3000 and &pound;4000 for two of her daughters.<br>
<br>Vere employed a number of puritan clergy as his personal chaplains and Lady Vere shared his religious tastes. In 1649 the presbyterian cleric, John Geree, described her as &#145;an ancient mother in our Israel&#146;  (Geree, A2<i>v</i>). In particular Lady Vere celebrated the protestant credentials of the Tracy family, which were firmly rooted in the early days of the Reformation. William Gurnall recorded that Lady Vere &#145;took much delight&#146; in the story of her ancestor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27653/', "William Tracy (d. 1530)")</script>, who was mentioned in Foxe's book of martyrs and whose remains were burnt after Archbishop Warham declared his will to be heretical in 1532  (Gurnall, 126&#150;7). This incident was also recalled by Henry Hexham in the dedication to Lady Vere of his translation of Polyander's <span class="italic">A Disputation Against the Adoration of the Reliques of Saints Departed</span> (1611).<br>
<br>After her marriage to Sir Horace, Lady Vere developed a reputation as a patron of godly ministers and she corresponded with William Ames, John Burgess, John Davenport, John Dod, John Preston, Peter Senthill, Obadiah Sedgewick, and James Ussher. Ames, one of the Veres' chaplains, thanked her for &#145;your kindness toward me and mine [and] your respect unto my poor ministry&#146; and Dod, vicar of Fawsley, wrote &#145;I make mention of you daily in my prayers&#146;. Dod also noted in 1642 that Lady Vere was &#145;naturally addicted unto melancholy&#146;. In 1624 Lady Vere used her influence with her sister Dorothy's husband, secretary of state Sir Edward Conway, to promote James Ussher as bishop of Meath. Ussher subsequently thanked Lady Vere for the &#145;effectual means&#146;, which she had used and asked her to thank Conway for his &#145;extraordinary kindness&#146;, although the two men had never met  (BL, Add. MS 4275, fols. 8<i>r</i>, 182<i>v</i>, 184<i>r</i>, 32<i>r</i>). Lady Vere also successfully lobbied Conway to have John Davenport appointed vicar of St Stephen, Coleman Street, London, despite accusations that Davenport's support came only from a puritan faction. Nicholas Byfield, Thomas Gataker, and Richard Sibbes all dedicated religious works to Lady Vere and Sir Horace. In his <span class="italic">Directions for the Private Reading of the Scriptures</span> (1618) Byfield particularly thanked them for the &#145;many favours I have received, but especially for all the incouragements wherewith I have been refreshed in observing your love to my ministerie&#146;  (A2<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Lady Vere spent some time accompanying her husband in the Netherlands and two of their five daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, were born at The Hague and were naturalized by act of parliament in 1624. Through the marriages of her daughters and of her niece, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12334/', "Brilliana Conway (Brilliana Harley)")</script>, Lady Vere was brought into close contact with the puritan opposition to the crown. Her eldest daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1683), married, in 1626, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13555/', "John Holles")</script>, from 1637 second earl of Clare; Mary (<i>c</i>.1611&#150;1669) married Sir Roger Townshend and then <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9139/', "Mildmay Fane")</script>, from 1638 second earl of Westmorland; Catharine (<i>b</i>. 1612/13) married, in 1634, Oliver St John of Lidiard Tregose, and then, in 1641, John Poulett, from 1649 Lord Paulet; Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66848/', "Fairfax, Anne (1617/&#150;1665)")</script>] married, in 1637, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9092/', "Thomas Fairfax")</script> (from 1648 Lord Fairfax); and Dorothy married John Wolstenholme. Lady Vere also acted as matchmaker in the marriage between Brilliana Conway and the Herefordshire puritan gentleman, Sir Robert Harley. Lady Vere acquainted Secretary Conway with Sir Robert's affection for his daughter and outlined his &#145;parentage, the abilities of his mind, his ripe discretion, his well-grounded religion&#146;, and last but not least the value of the Harley estates  (BL, Add. MS 61989, fol. 81<i>r</i>). In 1642 the Harleys sent their eldest daughter, Brilliana, to live with Lady Vere at her home in Hackney and Lady Harley reminded her daughter of the respect in which they held Lady Vere&#151;&#145;believe it, there is not a wiser and better woman&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70003, fol. 260<i>r</i>). In 1643 Lady Vere was briefly entrusted by parliament with the care of two of the king's children and in 1645 parliament granted her &pound;1000 as part of the arrears of the sum of &pound;2500 owed to her husband from the state. In January 1649 John Geree addressed the dedication of his <span class="italic">Might Overcoming Right</span> to Lady Vere and her daughter Anne Fairfax in the hope that they could persuade Sir Thomas Fairfax to save the king.<br>
<br>William Gurnall's funeral sermon for Lady Vere shows her life as an aged and pious widow. Twice daily she and her household worshipped God and on Sundays, after public worship, the sermon was repeated to her family. The servants were then called before her to give an account of the morning service and after supper she would join them in singing psalms. Twice a day Lady Vere would spend some hours alone in her closet reading the scriptures and other works of practical divinity, and every night she prayed with her female servants before retiring. She was renowned for her charity to the poor and sick, and Gurnall described her as &#145;a Protestant Dorcas, full of good works, and alms-deeds&#146;. &#145;Few ever exceeded her, in loving and honouring&#146; the &#145;faithful ministers of Christ&#146; and he described her zeal in finding &#145;able and faithful ministers for those livings she had in her dispose&#146;. On her deathbed in her &#145;acutest pains and greatest agonies&#146; she continued in &#145;admiring and blessing God for his mercies&#146;  (Gurnall, 130, 138, 141, 145). She died on 25 December 1671 and was buried on 10 January 1672. Her funeral sermon was published with a series of epitaphs by Charles Darby, rector of Kediton in Suffolk, Edward Thomas, Simon Ford, Anthony Withers, and Richard Howlett.<br>
