<span class="headword">Serres,  John Thomas</span>  (1759&#150;1825), <span class="occ">marine painter</span>, was born in December 1759, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25103/', "Dominic Serres (1722&#150;1793)")</script>, also a marine painter. Serres was trained by his father, a founding Royal Academician, and himself taught painting and marine draughtsmanship all his life. At the age of seventeen he was sufficiently accomplished to exhibit at the Royal Academy; his first teaching post was at the short-lived (1779&#150;87) Maritime School in Paradise Row, Chelsea, London. Though it has not been established whether Serres was patronized by the second earl of Warwick, it is certain that Serres met a house painter in Warwick's employ, Robert Wilmot, whose artistically precocious daughter, Olivia, became his pupil, and with whom he fell in love [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25106/', "Serres, Olivia")</script>]. Serres made a continental expedition, to France (where he witnessed the fall of the Bastille in Paris in July 1789) and Italy where, perhaps through his father, he had been afforded certain introductions by Sir Joshua Reynolds. If the date 1790 on the most distinguished of Serres's paintings <span class="italic">The Thames at Limehouse</span> (Royal Collection) is accepted, he returned to England before the end of that year. After some delay he married Olivia Wilmot (1772&#150;1835) on 1 September 1791 at Barton on the Heath, Warwickshire, where her uncle was the incumbent. The bride's unstable temperament gave rise to some misgivings about the match among the families of both parties.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in 1793 Serres succeeded him as marine painter to George III and to the duke of Clarence. His marriage was under strain but nevertheless produced various offspring, of which perhaps only two children, both daughters, survived infancy. As an official draughtsman to the Admiralty Serres was frequently absent from home, for as much as six months in 1800 when he was actually on sea service. He made &#145;drawings in the form of elevations&#146; of the coasts of France and Spain, a selection of which were published in <span class="italic">The Little Sea Torch</span> (1801)  (Archibald, 197). He taught drawing at the Chelsea Naval School and in 1805 published, under joint authorship with his father, <span class="italic">Liber nauticus, and Instructor in the Art of Marine Drawing</span>, a work intended to assist his students which contained plates after his own work and that of his father. In his absence, his wife committed numerous infidelities, and several frauds, which included forging her husband's name on bank drafts to the extent that Serres became a declared bankrupt. In 1802 a separation was mutually agreed, trusteeship for the daughters being invested, <i>inter alia</i>, in Olivia's current lover. In 1804 Serres abducted one of the daughters, for which he was charged by the trustees with breaching the trust and consigned to prison. Olivia evidently pursued her artist's career, since in 1806, two years before Serres's release from prison, she was appointed landscape painter to the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>On his release, Serres sought better fortune in Edinburgh, but his wife pursued him there and he was again committed. On release Serres ventured into theatre investment, becoming, in 1817, one of the proprietors of the Coburg Theatre and later its scenic director. This project lost him what money he had made during the closing years of the war. The collection of old master and contemporary drawings Serres had inherited from his father were dispersed at about this time. His financial adversities were further compounded by the refusal in 1822 of George IV (who as prince of Wales had patronized his wife) to continue the patronage his father had shown Serres. Though refused permission to act as the king's official draughtsman on his royal visit to Scotland in 1822, Serres nevertheless produced &#145;a set of large and well-crafted watercolours recording the event&#146;  (Deuchar, 482) (National Maritime Museum, London). Again imprisoned for debt, the artist was released on grounds of health in December 1825, but required to live within the rules of the king's bench. Serres died on 28 December 1825.<br>
<br>Serres worked skilfully in various media but, while his accuracy in ship depiction was akin to that of his father, John Thomas Serres was inclined to overdramatize weather conditions, as in, for example, his painting of George III's yacht <i>Royal Sovereign</i> (1804; National Maritime Museum, London). He is, however, more extensively represented at the National Maritime Museum than his father. Though his early triumph with <span class="italic">The Thames at Limehouse</span> (which gained the approbation of George III) was perhaps unequalled by his later work, despite his disastrous marriage, Serres continued to produce work of sensitivity in its depiction of Thames-side life.<br>
