<span class="headword">Powell,  John Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1753, <em>d.</em> 1801), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was baptized on 9 April 1753 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, the only son of James Powell of Queen Street, Westminster, and his wife, Ann. Admitted to the Middle Temple on 25 April 1775 he became a pupil of the conveyancer Charles Fearne, and was called to the bar on 5 May 1780. While in practice as a conveyancer Powell became one of the most prolific writers of legal treatises at a time when, following the publication of Sir William Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span>, a number of writers were attempting to portray the common law as a science based on reason and principle. Powell wrote several works on aspects of property law, including <span class="italic">A Treatise upon the Law of Mortgages</span> (1785), <span class="italic">An Essay on the Learning Respecting the Creation and Execution of Powers</span> (1787), and <span class="italic">An Essay upon the Learning of Devises</span> (1788). In addition he brought out new editions of Edward Wood's <span class="italic">A Complete Body of Conveyancing</span> (1790&#150;93) and of Fearne's <span class="italic">An Essay on the Learning of Contingent Remainders</span> (1795).<br>
<br>Powell's most important work was his <span class="italic">Essay upon the Law of Contracts and Agreements</span> (1790), which was the first comprehensive treatise on its subject. Beginning with the premise that &#145;all reasoning must be founded on first principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essay upon the Law of Contracts</span>, iii), Powell defined his notion of contract, laying particular stress on the importance of agreement, and then structured his book in such a way as to analyse the component parts of his definition. Although Powell used civilian sources for his work, and was influenced by the work of the French jurist R. J. Pothier, he limited his citations in general to English case law. He took the view that the fundamental principles of English law should be regarded with a &#145;sacred veneration&#146;  (ibid., vii), and held that the good administration of private law was essential for the preservation of the constitution. At the same time he felt free to criticize the decisions in cited cases where he felt the judges had erred in their principles. For instance, he attacked Lord Mansfield's decision in <i>Corbett v. Poelnitz</i> (1785), in which it was held that a <i>feme covert</i> who lived separately from her husband and had her separate maintenance could be sued on a contract made by her. Powell strongly criticized the judgment, dismissing Mansfield's notion that modern times required new developments, and concluded that it &#145;would be endless to pursue this idea through all its legal ABSURDITIES&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essay upon the Law of Contracts</span>, 98). The case was overruled in 1800.<br>
<br>Although Powell believed that legal rules could be modelled and adapted by the process of construction, he was very hostile to the blending of legal and equitable rights, which he associated especially with Mansfield. Commenting on Mansfield's decision in <i>Corbett</i>, he wrote, &#145;when a court of equity furnishes ample relief, there seems no <i>reason</i> why a court of law should <i>extend</i> its power, by overthrowing both the <i>soundest principles</i> and <i>clearest precedents</i>, merely because the parties have mistaken the remedy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essay upon the Law of Contracts</span>, 108). Powell's work on contract was popular on both sides of the Atlantic, and reached a sixth edition in America in 1825. However, despite its early importance the work was too rooted in eighteenth-century property law, and devoted too little attention to modern commercial transactions, to have an enduring success, and it was superseded in the early nineteenth century by the work of others, notably Joseph Chitty the younger and Charles Greenstreet Addison.<br>
<br>Powell died on 21 June 1801 at his home in Guildford Place, St Pancras, London, and was survived by his wife, Mary. She was a beneficiary of his will, but no more is known about her.<br>
