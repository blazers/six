<span class="headword">Clarke,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Edward the Grave, Standard Clarke]</span>  (1649<span class="mult">x</span>51&#150;1710), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only son of Edward Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1679), gentleman, of Chipley, near Taunton, Somerset, and his first wife, Ann, daughter of Mark Knight of Buckinghamshire. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 30 March 1667 (when his age was given as sixteen), moved to the Inner Temple in 1670, and was called to the bar in 1673. He became involved in whig politics and in 1680 was appointed trustee of the estate of Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury. He marked his arrival in county society by rebuilding Chipley in the 1680s, and engaging in rivalry with the nearby tory, John Sanford of Nynehead. He was an agricultural improver, introducing Friesland sheep and turnips to his estates.<br>
<br>In 1675 Clarke married Mary [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66720/', "Clarke, Mary (d. 1705)")</script>], daughter of Samuel Jepp and Elizabeth Buckland of Sutton Court, Chew Magna, distant kin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16885/', "John Locke")</script>. The <span class="italic">Correspondence of John Locke</span> contains nearly 400 letters to and from the Clarke family, from 1682 to 1704. One series (1684&#150;91), for the benefit of Edward junior, formed the basis of Locke's <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</span> (1693). Locke sent Clarke drafts of <span class="italic">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>, and left papers with him when he fled to the Netherlands in 1683. He was devoted to Clarke's children, nicknaming Betty &#145;his wife&#146; and minutely advising on their upbringing.<br>
<br>Locke called his west-country friends &#145;the Row&#146;: Clarke, Sir Walter Yonge, third baronet, of Escott, and Richard Duke of Otterton. They shared whig politics and were arrested on suspicion during the Monmouth rebellion. They were tempted to make peace with James II when offered revenge against toryism: Clarke secured the backing of James's electoral agents. Consequently he suffered at the polls in the revolution elections of 1689 and did not enter parliament until 1690. He had been defeated at his first attempt in 1685, and in 1689 petitioned the Commons against tory violence at the hustings. His seat throughout was Taunton, and once successful he sat until his death. Although an Anglican, his sympathies lay with his dissenting, textile-artisan constituents. In 1689, through Locke, he was appointed auditor-general to Mary II; her death in 1694 was a great blow. He remained a court whig, becoming an excise commissioner in 1694, and serving the junto leader, John Somers, Baron Somers. He resisted Locke's urging that he become a director of the Bank of England.<br>
<br>Clarke mainly lodged in London, directed the education of a brood of children, and left Chipley and the nursing of his constituency to the redoubtable Mary. He became Locke's voice in parliament, the keystone of &#145;the College&#146;, which included Locke, John Freke, Yonge, and Somers. Clarke's papers include many draft bills and policy documents. He was engaged in the ending of press censorship (1695), the great recoinage (1695&#150;6), and the <span class="roman">Irish Woollen Act</span> (1697&#150;8). Among the nicknames he earned were Edward the Grave and Standard Clarke, and the widespread hardship resulting from the recoinage reduced his electoral popularity.<br>
<br>Illness rendered Clarke inactive in the 1700s. Mary died in January 1705; he died at Chipley on 20 October 1710 when he was, according to a memorial tablet in Nynehead church where he was buried, aged sixty-one. They had five sons and six daughters (born between 1676 and 1694), eight of whom survived infancy. One son, Jack, was apprenticed to the Quaker merchant of Amsterdam, Benjamin Furly. Clarke left about &pound;17,000, mainly in Bank and East India stock. Chipley was demolished in the nineteenth century and the Sanford descendants withdrew to the smaller house adjacent, where legends persist about Locke composing philosophy on the bowling green.<br>
