<span class="headword">Kite,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1537), <span class="occ">archbishop of Armagh and bishop of Carlisle</span>, was born in London to unknown parents. He was admitted a king's scholar at Eton College about 1476, and then went to King's College, Cambridge, also as a scholar, in 1480. His graduation is not recorded, but in 1494/5 he proceeded BCnL. For unspecified reasons he was excused lecturing in the following academic year. By then he had already started to acquire ecclesiastical benefices, starting in 1493, when he became a canon of Tamworth with the prebend of Wilmercote. He became rector of Wolferton, Norfolk, in 1496, and of Boscombe, Wiltshire, in 1499. Subsequent preferments included prebends in Chichester Cathedral (1507), Salisbury Cathedral (1510), and Crediton collegiate church (1513). A royal chaplain by 1509, in that capacity he took part in the funeral of Henry VII and the coronation of Henry VIII; by February 1510 he had become subdean of the Chapel Royal. In the latter capacity he took part in court revels. Although his presence seems to have been partly associated with the music provided by the chapel's children, there is evidence that he had a fine singing voice, which enabled him to appear as a performer in his own right; hence his being provided with 16 yards of blue damask in February 1511, &#145;for a garment of strange fashion, and a rolled cap like that of a Baron of the Exchequer&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 2/2, p. 1496).<br>
<br>Throughout his career Kite was friendly with Thomas Wolsey, to whom he owed his provision to the archbishopric of Armagh on 24 October 1513. The appointment seems to have been intended as a reward, but Kite regarded it as more of an &#145;honourable exile&#146;  (Ellis, 115), and returned to England at regular intervals. He was present when Wolsey received his cardinal's hat on 15 November 1515, and he also attended the baptism of Princess Mary on 21 February 1516. At the end of February 1518 he was sent with John Bourchier, second Baron Bourchier, on an embassy to Charles I of Castile (later Emperor Charles V). Delays and diplomatic manoeuvring plagued their mission, as Kite's letters to Henry VIII and Wolsey amply record. Henry shared their frustration, and in a letter of 4 November 1518 he rebuked Kite, complaining that his reports were brief and contained little of importance, and suggesting that he had not discussed matters as fully with Charles as the king desired. Clearly troubled by Henry's loss of confidence in him, Kite responded by complaining of delays that were beyond his control, while allowing that his lack of diplomatic experience could have contributed to his difficulties. Subsequent letters were more detailed, and Kite reported on Charles's preparations against the Turks and on tensions between the Flemish and the Spaniards. By 8 January 1519 Kite had taken his leave of the Spanish king and set off for England. No doubt his experience abroad lay behind his being included among those who attended Henry VIII in 1520, both at the Field of Cloth of Gold in June and at his meeting with Charles at Gravelines in July.<br>
<br>Kite was never comfortable with his position as archbishop of Armagh. He may have savoured his status as primate of Ireland, but he quite obviously did not like either the country or its inhabitants, as he showed in plaintive letters to Wolsey. No sooner had he arrived than he was writing of being &#145;far from your heaven, from the sight of our most gracious King and Queen &hellip; from the wealth of all the joys of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 1/1, no. 2907), and described with horror his coming to Drogheda, where his ship was attacked by two Breton pirates, who were driven off only with difficulty. He urged the king to come to Ireland to restore order, and in his early letters to Wolsey anticipated some kind of royal intervention, but as it became clear that Henry's priorities lay elsewhere, so Kite himself lost interest in Irish affairs. In 1515 he formed part of a mission which reported to the council at Greenwich and complained of Ireland's parlous state. Its complaints were dismissed, and thereafter Kite spent little if any time in Ireland.<br>
<br>Kite secured a formal release from involvement with Ireland on 12 July 1521 when he was translated to the see of Carlisle, at a cost of 1790 ducats in papal fees. The temporalities were restored on 12 November. To preserve his status he was also made archbishop of Thebes <i>in partibus infidelium</i>, while perhaps because Carlisle was a poor diocese he was by 1522 holding the rectory of St Stephen Walbrook, London, <i>in commendam</i>. Wolsey sent him north to help maintain order on the borders and to assist Thomas, second Baron Dacre, the warden of the marches, as councillor and treasurer in conflicts with the Scots. His letters to Wolsey reveal an appalling situation, though he did not attribute it to Scottish raids. He reported in June 1523 that there was &#145;more theft, more extortion, by English thieves, than there is by all the Scots of Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 3/2, no. 2328), and a year later complained that in travelling from Newcastle to Carlisle he would be forced to ride some 60 miles out of his way to avoid bandits. Other royal agents, notably the earl of Surrey, echoed his views.<br>
<br>Kite was more energetic in the north than he ever was in Ireland. He continued the work of his predecessors in rebuilding his palace, Rose Castle, and in October 1523 begged Wolsey's mercy for the people of Newcastle, presumably under sentence of excommunication as they had been unable to receive the sacraments since before Easter. He seems to have been one of the bishops whose estate management involved the granting of longer leases, for his successor Robert Aldridge commented in 1537 that Kite had &#145;left nothing unlet for more years than he or his successor will probably see&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 12/2, no. 848). Kite's epitaph (now lost) was apparently referring to his episcopate when it described him as &#145;Kepyng nobyl Houshold wyth grete Hospitality&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Ath. Cantab.</span>, 63). But he still longed to return to court. His letters to Wolsey, in one of which he apologized to the cardinal for detaining his own archdeacon (who was also Wolsey's secretary) in the north, and in another even claimed to have dreamed of the cardinal, help to explain why the sixth earl of Northumberland dubbed him &#145;the flatteryng Byshope of Carel&#146;  (Bouch, 187). He remained loyal to Wolsey, however, and after the latter's fall from power lent him &#145;dysshes to eate hys meate in And plate to drynke in and also lynnyn clothes to occupie&#146;  (Cavendish, 104).<br>
<br>Kite was probably conservative in his religious views, as might have been expected of a friend of Viscount Lisle, but he supported the king in his pursuit of a divorce from Katherine of Aragon, and in 1534 subscribed the oath of supremacy. By the 1530s he seems to have been living mainly in London, where in 1536 he was recorded as playing cards with Sir William Kingston. He died there on 19 June 1537 and was buried in Stepney parish church three days later.<br>
