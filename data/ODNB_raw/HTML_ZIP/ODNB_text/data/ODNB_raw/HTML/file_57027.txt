<span class="headword">Barraud,  Herbert Rose</span>  (1844/5&#150;1896), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born in London, the second of nine children and the eldest son of the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1507/', "Henry Barraud (bap. 1811, d. 1874)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1508/', "Barraud, William")</script>] and his wife, Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of James Rose of St Clement Danes, London. He was educated at the Jesuit-run Stonyhurst College, his father having converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1871 he was working as a clerk, but little else is known of his early life. On 29 August 1876, at St Mary's Roman Catholic church, Clapham, he married Lucy Mary (<i>b</i>. 1844/5), daughter of Frederick Capes, solicitor. They had seven children.<br>
<br>Barraud established his first photographic studio, Barraud and Jerrard, in mews near the family home at 96 Gloucester Place, London, in 1874. It is likely that he gained knowledge of the mechanics and potential of portrait photography from his father, who made extensive use of the medium in his work. An early publication by the Barraud and Jerrard Studio was <span class="italic">The Medical Profession in All Countries</span> (1874), which for some time was mistakenly attributed to Henry Barraud. The names associated with the studio have also been confused (sometimes erroneously given as William Barraud). There is a further question surrounding the association of Herbert's studio in London with Barraud studios in Liverpool and Dublin: the Bold Street, Liverpool, and Dublin branches were operated separately by Herbert's brothers Francis and Philip.<br>
<br>Herbert Barraud continued with his work in the medical field to create the ambitious <span class="italic">Members of the International Medical Congress, London, 1881</span>, a composite photograph of the 684 members of the seventh congress arranged in an impressive neo-Gothic tiered hall which, it has been suggested, is the interior of St James's Hall, Piccadilly. The photograph was published with a key by Bailliere, Tindall, and Cox and was available in two sizes&#151;47 inches by 30 or 29 inches by 20. Ten years later he constructed and published another large-scale composite of members of the Seventh International Congress of Hygiene and Demography.<br>
<br>Barraud hit his professional stride with the establishment of a studio at 263 Oxford Street in 1882. Warm, well decorated, spacious, and practical, the environment was created with the convenience of his sitters and the spectacle of the portrait sitting in mind. According to a contemporary account the view from the studio &#145;reminds you of that from Van Bosch's studio in Paris&#146;  (<span class="italic">Photographic News</span>, Feb 1882). A lift alleviated the need to climb stairs, giving easy access to the purpose-built glass house constructed on the top floor to maximize natural light. Barraud charged half a guinea for a sitting, two proofs, and six carte-de-visite copies. For a guinea the sitter could have twenty-four copies in carte size. Most novel of the studio's equipment was a large sketch of a &#145;humorous countenance&#146; positioned on a stand known as the &#145;laughing cure&#146;. Shown to the sitter without warning at the time of making the exposure, it was used both to steady the gaze and to &#145;unlock the features&#146;&#151;even of &#145;sulky and morose&#146; children  (<span class="italic">Photographic News</span>, 16 Feb 1883, 100&#150;01).<br>
<br>Barraud is best-known for his series <span class="italic">Men and Women of the Day</span>&#151;a chronicle, in both photographs and text, of eminent men and women across a range of fields of endeavour published annually between 1888 and 1891. These were often shot simply in front of a mottled or plain backdrop, most commonly head and shoulders or three-quarter length and sometimes employing simple props or furniture. Several of his female subjects, including the actress Mary Moore (Lady Wyndham; <i>c</i>.1889), Ellen Terry (1888), Marion Bessie Terry (<i>c</i>.1891), and Lady Randolph Churchill (<i>c</i>.1889), appear with striking effect in front of the same oriental screen. The American singer Agnes Huntington (<i>c</i>.1890) appears in a sequined black dress and rests against what looks to be a frontier-style farm gate. Each has a concentrated intensity not uncommon in studio portraits of the day, but also a less frequently achieved immediacy of pose particularly evident in the hands.<br>
<br>Other famous portraits by Barraud include that of Alfred, Lord Tennyson seated with a copy of Homer's <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> in his lap (<i>c</i>.1888) and the remarkable portrait of Cardinal Newman (<i>c</i>.1888), which in gesture and crop resembles an example of twentieth-century portrait photography. Newman however wrote of his dislike of the image, particularly the focus on his threadbare coat. John Ruskin sat for Barraud twice, in 1882 at Herne Hill and in 1885 at his Oxford Street premises, and wrote praising his efforts. Barraud later used Ruskin's comments as a testimonial:<blockquote>they are the first photographs ever done of me that expressed what good or character there is in me for my own work; and as pure photography they seem to me to go as far as the art can at this day (and I do not believe it can ever do much better). (Ruskin to Barraud, 30 April 1882, <span class="italic">The Works of John Ruskin</span>, ed. E. T. Cook and A. Wedderburn, 1908, 34.562)</blockquote>The London session shows Ruskin in various poses, one against a backdrop of outdoor scenery. This may have been a response to the sitter's earlier request that he be photographed &#145;in open light, for the sake of fair play to the Day&#146;  (ibid.), but it amused Ruskin, reminding him of the pose of &#145;young ladies and professional beauties&#146;  (ibid., 38.212).<br>
<br>Barraud's Oxford Street studio went into rapid decline for reasons which have not been fully established. The firm became a limited company in 1892, the year in which financial difficulties forced Barraud to take employment as manager of the studios of Mayall &amp; Co., at 164 New Bond Street. Family tradition suggests that though generous, his means fell somewhat short of his extravagant lifestyle. By 1887, despite running a prestigious and well-known London studio, he struggled to repay &pound;400 originally raised to help the widow of his brother, the scenic artist Mark Barraud (1848&#150;1887). Having occupied a large house at 12 Dorset Square, Marylebone, London, and spending his summers at Guildford in Surrey, he was latterly resident at Derry Downs, St Mary Cray, Kent. He died there on 24 November 1896, of gallstones and perforation of the bowel, aged fifty-one.<br>
