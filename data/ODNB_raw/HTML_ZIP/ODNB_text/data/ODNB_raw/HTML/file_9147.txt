<span class="headword">Fanshawe,  Catherine Maria</span>  (1765&#150;1834), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Shabden in Chipstead, Surrey, on 6 July 1765, the second daughter of John Fanshawe (1738&#150;1816) of Shabden, who was first clerk of the board of green cloth in the household of George III, and his wife, Penelope, daughter and sole representative of John Dredge of Reading, Berkshire (<i>d</i>. 1807). On John Fanshawe's death the estate was sold, and the old house has since entirely disappeared, although Fanshawe and his wife were buried in Chipstead churchyard. Their eldest son, John, died in 1772, and Robert Charles, the only other boy, in 1789. Catherine and her sisters, their father's coheirs, lived together after his death at 15 Berkeley Square, London, and at Midhurst House, Richmond, Surrey, and belonged to a small set of London intellectuals and literati.<br>
<br>Catherine Fanshawe was endowed with varied accomplishments and with a sympathetic disposition. She was the only one of the three sisters who wrote verses, although all of them were good artists. Their manners, however, were marked by excessive formality, and Catherine was in addition physically disabled and very delicate. She was &#145;admirable as a letter-writer, as a reader of Shakespeare, and as a designer in almost every style&#146;, was the testimony of Mary Mitford, who added that her friend's &#145;drawings and etchings are those of an artist&#146;  (Mitford, 1.251). Lockhart called her &#145;a woman of rare wit and genius, in whose society Scott greatly delighted&#146;  (Lockhart, 7.156), and Scott himself said &#145;I read Miss Fanshawe's pieces, which are quite beautiful&#146;  (ibid., 158). She offered to make the Revd William Harness her heir, but he declined the offer, and she left him her etchings and manuscripts, from the latter of which he compiled her <span class="italic">Memorials</span>.<br>
<br>Catherine Fanshawe's poems long remained in manuscript or in private collections. Several of her pieces were published in Joanna Baillie's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span> (1823) and numerous extracts from these are quoted in Mary Mitford's <span class="italic">Recollections of a Literary Life</span>. Her best-known poem is the riddle on the letter &#145;H&#146;, which was often attributed to Lord Byron and was included in at least two editions of his works. It originated in a conversation on the misuse of that letter when she was visiting Thomas Hope at Deepdene, Surrey. She wrote it during the night, read the lines to the guests at breakfast next morning, and wrote them in Hope's album. The opening line, modified by James Smith, runs:<blockquote>
<div>'Twas whispered in heaven, 'twas muttered in hell.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Two lines of a poem by Praed, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> in March 1833, suggested her &#145;Speech of the Member for Odium&#146;, a poetic squib on Cobbett who sat for Oldham, which was afterwards printed for private circulation. A few copies of Catherine Fanshawe's <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, which contained most of her poems and nine photographs from her etchings, were printed by Harness in 1865 for circulation among her friends, and 250 copies of <span class="italic">The Literary Remains of Catherine Maria Fanshawe, with Notes by the Late Rev. William Harness</span> were issued by Pickering in 1876. Miss Berry's <span class="italic">Journal</span> includes a letter and poem by Catherine Fanshawe  (M. Berry, <span class="italic">Extracts of the Journals and Correspondence of Miss Berry from &hellip; 1783 to 1852</span>, ed. T. Lewis, 3 vols., 1865, 2.297&#150;302) and another poem, entitled &#145;The Country Cat Docketed by Miss Fanshawe&#146;  (3.562&#150;8). An extract from one of her letters, describing a dinner party at Sir Humphry Davy's house, at which Byron and Madame de Sta&euml;l met, was printed in <span class="italic">Murray's Magazine</span> (1887). Three of her poems are included in Locker's <span class="italic">Lyra elegantiarum</span>.<br>
<br>Two of Catherine Fanshawe's sketchbooks belonged to the wife (<i>d</i>. 1904) of Dean Gregory of St Paul's Cathedral, daughter of Catherine Fanshawe's first cousin, Lady Stopford. Mrs Gregory also owned some large watercolour drawings by Catherine Fanshawe illustrating Shakespeare's &#145;Seven Ages of Man&#146;. Several of her sketchbooks went to Mrs Gregory's sisters, the Misses Stopford of Richmond. Many of them are foreign sketches, depicting tours in Italy, but some delineate English scenery. Catherine Fanshawe paid numerous visits to the south of Europe for the benefit of her health.<br>
<br>Catherine Fanshawe died at Putney Heath, Surrey, after a long and painful illness, on 17 April 1834. Penelope, her elder sister, had died of influenza in April 1833. Both are commemorated, with their parents and two brothers, on the tombstone at Chipstead, and Penelope is also remembered on a tablet in Richmond parish church. Elizabeth Christiana, the younger sister, died at Richmond on 25 March 1856. The house in Berkeley Square was then sold, and Midhurst House at Richmond was left to the sisters' first cousin, the widow of the Hon. Sir Robert Stopford.<br>
