<span class="headword">Reeves,  Marjorie Ethel</span>  (1905&#150;2003), <span class="occ">historian and educationist</span>, was born on 17 July 1905 at Bratton, near Westbury, Wiltshire, in the family of three daughters and one son of Robert John Ward Reeves, manufacturer of agricultural implements, and his wife, Edith Saffery, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitaker. Her parents were Baptists. She was educated at the High School for Girls, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, where she was inspired by her historian headteacher to go on to study history at St Hugh's College, Oxford. Graduating with a first-class degree in 1926, she went on to take her diploma in education at the university's department of educational studies the following year. She then taught at the Roan School for Girls in Greenwich for two years before taking up a research fellowship at Westfield College, London, in 1929.<br>
<br>In the late 1920s Reeves had discovered, in the library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, the work of Joachim of Fiore, the medieval visionary mystic. She decided to pursue her doctoral studies at Westfield College on Joachim, despite the scornful reaction of one of her contemporaries: &#145;that outlandish subject won't assist your career. You should have chosen something like the wardrobe under Edward II&#146;  (B. McGinn, &#145;Memorial remarks for Marjorie E. Reeves&#146;, in <span class="italic">Tributes to Marjorie Reeves</span>). But not only did she make the substance of her doctorate (obtained in 1932) her seminal work (finally published in 1969 as <span class="italic">The Influence of Prophecy in the Later Middle Ages: a Study in Joachimism</span>), she created something of an international renaissance of interest in the mystic, reflected in frequent congresses, numerous publications, and in the late 1970s the foundation of the Centro Internazionale di Studi Gioachimiti, in San Giovanni, Fiore. Among her own further publications on Joachim were (with Beatrice Hirsch-Reich) an edition of <span class="italic">The Figurae of Joachim of Fiore</span> (1972), and, four years later, <span class="italic">Joachim of Fiore and the Prophetic Future</span>. A volume of essays in her honour, edited by Ann Williams and entitled <span class="italic">Prophecy and Millenarianism</span>, was published in 1980, and she was made an honorary citizen of the commune of San Giovanni, Fiore, in 1994. According to Sir Richard Southern, Reeves broke radically with prevailing views of what medieval historians should do through her work on Joachim and his followers.<br>
<br>In 1931 Reeves took up a post as lecturer in history at St Gabriel's Teacher Training College in Camberwell, where she inspired future teachers with her vision of education. That vision was influenced by the philosopher John Macmurray, and his seminal work on the primacy of the personal in the reconstruction of the future, developed in his lectures at University College, London, which she attended. Returning to Oxford in 1938 she became a tutor for the Society of Oxford Home Students (which became the St Anne's Society in 1942 and St Anne's College ten years later). During the Second World War the society occupied 13 Norham Gardens, where she lived in the former study of the regius professor of medicine, Sir William Osler. As air raid warden for Norham Gardens she was the university's last line of defence against the might of the Luftwaffe. Their threat she took seriously, and when it was rumoured that the Germans were about to be parachuted onto Salisbury Plain she made the difficult train journey home to Wiltshire to hide her left-wing literature in the rafters, to protect her mother and sister.<br>
<br>Although a medieval scholar of international renown, Reeves never lost her practical involvement with schools or her interest in history teaching. When training teachers at St Gabriel's in the 1930s she devised a history syllabus for aspiring hairdressers in which, among other things, they imitated the hair styles of ancient Egypt&#151;a surprising sight at that time in Camberwell. She produced, from the 1950s, history books for schools which revolutionized the teaching of history. The <span class="roman">Then and There</span> series (of which she was general editor, and to which she contributed twelve volumes, with titles like <span class="italic">The Medieval Village</span>, 1954, <span class="italic">The Medieval Castle</span>, 1960, and <span class="italic">The Elizabethan Country House</span>, 1984) enabled pupils to make sense of the lives of people in other places and times. It is a tribute to Reeves's brilliance as a teacher that the earliest of these books were still being used half a century later. She received the Medlicott medal of the Historical Association in 1993 for her contribution to history education.<br>
<br>When invited to join the Central Advisory Council for Education in 1947 Reeves asked the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Education, Sir John Maud, what was the main responsibility of its members. She relished his response: &#145;it is to be prepared to die at the first ditch as soon as politicians get their hands on education&#146;  (personal knowledge). She remained on the Central Advisory Council until 1961, and contributed to what became known (after the chairman of the council, Sir Geoffrey Crowther) as the Crowther report of 1959, which recommended the raising of the school-leaving age to 16. In the 1940s she also served on the education and training committee of the National Coal Board. Indeed, it was during the Second World War that her educational ideals&#151;the primacy of the personal, the location of the self within a wider community, openness to argument leading to commitment&#151;expressed themselves most clearly in action. She was a founding member of the Moot, which met regularly for ten years after the Oxford conference in 1937, looking beyond the war to the new social order which would need to be constructed. It was through this group that she worked with J. H. Oldham, Sir Walter Moberly, Karl Mannheim, Sir Fred Clarke, Archbishop William Temple, T. S. Eliot, R. H. Tawney, Michael Polanyi, and many others; their discussions&#151;exciting, committed, inspiring, idealistic&#151;were an important influence on the reforms of the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. Closely connected with the Moot in the 1940s was the Student Christian Movement, of which she was an active member. She edited in 1999 the history of that organization and its connections with the Moot, under the beguiling title <span class="italic">Christian Thinking and Social Order: Conviction Politics from the 1930s to the Present Day</span>. In this work she chronicled the bringing together of the best within the Christian tradition to which she belonged, the deliberations of some of the most distinguished social and political thinkers of the time, and a commitment to the creation of a just and fair reconstruction of society, reflecting (as highlighted by Reinhold Niebuhr in his contribution to the meeting of the Student Christian Movement in 1939) &#145;the tension of holding together a sense of eternal perspective and a passion for righteousness on earth&#146;  (M. Reeves, ed., <span class="italic">Christian Thinking and the Social Order</span>, 1999, 15).<br>
<br>Reeves remained a fellow and tutor at St Anne's College until her retirement in 1972 (serving as vice-principal from 1951 to 1962 and again from 1964 to 1967); thereafter she was an honorary fellow. She remained active intellectually to the end. At ninety-eight, despite physical frailty, she was planning her next book on the teaching of history. She was also preparing her contribution to the <span class="italic">Oxford Review of Education</span>'s special issue on Oxford University's contribution to education in the twentieth century. Her piece was to be on the contribution of women dons, most of whom she had known. However, it is appropriate that her final book should have been a history of the University Church of St Mary (2003). For it was to this community, present and past, that she belonged. She died at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 27 November 2003, of bronchopneumonia. She never married.<br>
