<span class="headword">Shilling,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1621), <span class="occ">naval officer in the East India Company</span>, of unknown parentage, is first recorded on 25 November 1589, when he married Agnes Poape (<i>d</i>. 1620) at Plymouth. His eldest daughter, Damaris (who is mentioned in his will), the first of at least ten children, was baptized at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, on 8 October 1592. Shilling served as master's mate of the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i> under Captain James Lancaster on a privateering voyage in 1590 and was master of the <i>Golden Dragon</i>, a privateer commanded by Captain Christopher Newport, in 1593.<br>
<br>No evidence has been found to support a statement that Shilling began as a petty officer in the navy, but he was appointed one of the six masters attendant of the navy, whose duties were mainly in harbour, on 30 May 1603. The post did not preclude other employment, and he was master of the <i>Angel</i> on merchant voyages to the Mediterranean in 1609, 1612, and 1614. He was an elder brother of Trinity House by 1612. Although considered for employment by the East India Company in 1610 and 1615, neither appointment materialized, but he was master of the <i>Anne Royal</i> in the East India Company voyage commanded by Martin Pring in 1617. Apart from an unfortunate incident when the failure of his gunner to remove the shot from a gun before firing a salute resulted in a death ashore, Shilling did well. After accomplishing a mission to the Red Sea to secure freedom of trade in 1618 he arrived back in England in September 1619.<br>
<br>The East India Company quickly decided to appoint Shilling as commander of their next voyage. The lord high admiral was reluctant to grant permission, describing Shilling as one of the most able men in the kingdom. The company retorted that the navy had terminated his appointment as master attendant because of his involvement with them, and eventually agreement was secured. There was friction between Shilling and the company because of his alterations to his ship, the <i>London</i>, and his complaints about the state of his fleet, but the ships left Tilbury on 26 February 1620. Two days later Shilling's wife was buried. Before leaving England, Shilling made his will.<br>
<br>After reaching Surat, Shilling sent two ships to the Persian Gulf, but hearing of the presence there of a strong Portuguese squadron, he followed with two more ships, capturing a Portuguese ship on the way. He met the first two English ships returning, but Shilling resolved to fight. The first encounter off Jask on 16 December 1620 was indecisive and the Portuguese prize was mistakenly set on fire. Battle resumed on 28 December, but a calm prevented two of the four English ships engaging. The Portuguese fled, but Shilling was mortally wounded, died on 6 January 1621, and was buried ashore three days later.<br>
