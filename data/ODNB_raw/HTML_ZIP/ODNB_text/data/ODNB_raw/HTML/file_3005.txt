<span class="headword">Bourne,  Hugh</span>  (1772&#150;1852), <span class="occ">founder of the Primitive Methodist church</span>, son of Joseph Bourne, farmer and wheelwright, and his wife, Ellen Steele, was born at Fordhays Farm, in the parish of Stoke-on-Trent on 3 April 1772, and, after some education at nearby Werrington and Bucknall, worked with his father in his business. The family moved to Bemersley, in the parish of Norton in the Moors, in 1788, and Bourne then took employment under his uncle, William Sharratt, a millwright and engineer at Milton, Staffordshire.<br>
<br>Bourne had been carefully brought up by a pious mother, and his conversion occurred through solitary reading. In June 1799 he joined the Wesleyan Methodists, soon after became a local preacher, and in 1802 built, chiefly at his own expense, a chapel at Harriseahead, Staffordshire. In imitation of the camp meetings which had promoted revivalism in America, Bourne, together with his brother James, William Clowes, and others, held a camp meeting on Mow Cop, near Harriseahead, on Sunday 31 May 1807. The meeting commenced at six in the morning, and prayer, praise, and preaching were continued until eight at night. This successful meeting was the first of many held in that part of the country. The Wesleyan Methodist conference at Liverpool on 27 July 1807 passed a resolution prohibiting such gatherings. The camp meetings, however, continued, and on 27 June 1808 Bourne was expelled from the Wesleyan Methodist Society by the Burslem circuit's quarterly meeting; but he still continued to raise societies, recommending them to join the Wesleyan circuits, and as yet entertained no idea of organizing a separate community. The Wesleyan authorities remained hostile, and a disruption was the consequence.<br>
<br>On 14 March 1810 the first class of the new community was formed at Stanley, near Bemersley. Quarterly tickets were introduced in the following year, and the first general meeting of the society was held at Tunstall on 26 July 1811. The name Primitive Methodist, implying a desire to restore Methodism to its primitive simplicity, was formally adopted on 13 February 1812, but the opponents of the movement often called the members &#145;ranters&#146;. The first annual conference was held at Hull in May 1820, and a deed poll of the Primitive Methodists was enrolled in the court of chancery on 10 February 1830. Bourne and his brother purchased land and built the first chapel of the new connexion at Tunstall in 1811. After the foundation and settlement of the society Bourne made many evangelizing journeys to Scotland and Ireland. During 1844&#150;6 he travelled in Canada and America, where he obtained large congregations.<br>
<br>Bourne lived to see Primitive Methodism with 1400 Sunday schools, 5300 chapels, and 110,000 enrolled members. He died, unmarried, from a mortification of his foot, at Bemersley on 11 October 1852, aged eighty, and was buried at Englesea Brook, Cheshire. He was, in common with many preachers and members of the Primitive Methodist church, a rigid abstainer. Bourne's preaching skills were limited; he was most notable for the more intimate, &#145;conversation&#146; and cottage prayer meetings. For the greater part of his life he worked as a carpenter and builder, so as not to become chargeable to the denomination, and it was not until he had reached his seventieth year that he was placed on the superannuation fund. He published widely, including an <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (n.d.); an unconventional defence of female preaching in <span class="italic">Remarks on the Ministry of Women</span> (1808); <span class="italic">A Treatise on Baptism</span> (1823); a <span class="italic">History of the Primitive Methodists</span> (1823); and a <span class="italic">Large Hymn Book</span> (1824). He was also editor of the <span class="italic">Primitive Methodist Magazine</span> for twenty years.<br>
