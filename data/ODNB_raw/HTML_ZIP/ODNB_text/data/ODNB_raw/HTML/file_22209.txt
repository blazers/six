<span class="headword">Pickering,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1537), <span class="occ">Dominican friar and rebel</span>, was probably born in or near Bridlington, Yorkshire. Nothing is known of his parents or early life. He entered the Dominican house at York on 21 September 1510 and was ordained into the priesthood on 20 September 1516. Pickering entered the Cambridge house of the Blackfriars shortly afterwards but disapproved of both the reformist movement and the &#145;new learning&#146; that was gaining popularity there. Before Whitsunday 1525 he received his BTh from the University of Cambridge  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/118, fol. 284<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Assertions that Pickering was elected prior of the Cambridge Blackfriars lack adequate documentation. Some time before receiving his degree, he was appointed prior of the Blackfriars in York. Between 12 January and 4 May 1531, he attended the York convocation which debated the royal supremacy and was also present at the northern convocation of 1532, which finally acknowledged the king as head of the church. He was deeply angered both by this capitulation to royal pressure and by the high-handed manner in which the English church was being reformed. After the northern clergy's acquiescence to Henry VIII in May 1532 he wrote a formal protest which he produced at the clerical assembly at Pontefract, Yorkshire, on 4&#150;5 December 1536. He was a friend and possible prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the influential Dominican friar Dr Marmaduke Waldby, prebendary of Carlisle and associate of the imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys.<br>
<br>Pickering was articulate and intelligent, but also restless, hot-tempered, and impetuous. Although the chronicle of the London Greyfriars refers to him in May 1537 as prior of York, other evidence indicates that he had resigned this office some years earlier, possibly following the clergy's submission of 1532. He appears to have proceeded to a DTh degree, but as no record exists at the universities of Cambridge or Oxford he may have studied on the continent, possibly through Waldby's influence. By 1536 Pickering was back in Yorkshire with a tenuous connection to the Dominican house in Scarborough where he had a number of friends. He may also have held some sort of living in or near Bridlington as he is consistently referred to in contemporary records as &#145;of Bridlington&#146;, although this may also be a reference to his place of birth  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 12/1, nos. 1206, 1207 (8)). When the commons of Lincolnshire rose in October 1536, Pickering was visiting William Wood, prior of the Augustinian house at Bridlington. Both men were in perfect sympathy with the insurrection, and Pickering confided to Wood that the uprising &#145;was well done for the wealth of the church&#146;  (ibid., no. 1019). In the later charges brought against him, it was contended that Pickering had been among the rebels who rallied at Sherburn, Yorkshire, on 10 October, but he denied this. His participation in the first uprising seems to have taken the form of writing seditious letters and passing messages between the various rebel leaders.<br>
<br>At the beginning of December Edward Lee, archbishop of York, sent for Pickering to attend a meeting of learned clerics being assembled at Pontefract Abbey to discuss the royal supremacy and dissolution of the monasteries. Wood gave him a horse and money for the journey. Pickering was not closely acquainted with Lee; in fact he testified that he had heard the archbishop preach but once, yet he believed him to be an avid supporter of the new and more serious uprising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. He was present at Lee's sermon on Sunday 3 December in All Hallows Church, Pontefract, and, like the commons who crowded the upper galleries, fully expected the archbishop would encourage them to rebel. When the Lancaster herald entered the church, however, Lee, according to an angry Pickering, suddenly &#145;did resist from his purpose of pilgrimage and [swore] to show how it was not lawful for us to make battle without commendation of our prince&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/118, fol. 279<i>r</i>). Over the next two days Pickering played a prominent part in the clerical council's discussions and disputations based on those discussed at convocation in 1531&#150;2, and on the afternoon of 5 December, they took the finished articles summing up their opinions to Lee. When the archbishop came to the article which stated that &#145;the Bishop of Rome should be Supreme Head&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 12/1, no. 786 3), he wanted to cross it out as unnecessary but both Pickering and Cuthbert Marshall, Lee's own chancellor, insisted that it be maintained. He reluctantly agreed to leave it in as expressing &#145;the consent of Christian people&#146;.<br>
<br>Pickering had brought with him to Pontefract copies of his most important contribution to the Pilgrimage of Grace. This was a 150-line poem written at the end of October at Bridlington which expressed his feelings of anger and resentment at the &#145;Southern Turks perverting our law [and] spoiling Christ[s] church&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/118, fol. 292<i>v</i>). The poem, which in effect called for a crusade against southern heresy, captured in verse much of the general feeling of outrage prevalent in the north during the pilgrimage. Some of the rhymes which Pickering incorporated into his work were being sung by itinerant minstrels and turned into handbills, samples of which were given to him by the rebel leader John Hallam while on a visit to Bridlington. At Hallam's insistence Pickering took the popular rhymes and rewrote them in a scholarly yet vituperative style, adding suitable Latin tags and additional material from Jewish history. Although the work was often referred to as &#145;the marching song of the revolution&#146;  (Bush, 62), Pickering himself stated that it was not his intent that it should be set to music or &#145;sungen by any minstrels&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/118, fol. 284<i>v</i>). The poem focused on a vigorous and uncompromising call to arms of the &#145;faithful people of the boreal region&#146; to fight &#145;these Southern heretics devoid of all virtue&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/118, fol. 292<i>r</i>). Pickering also incorporated paraphrases of an earlier, anonymous play that was thought to have been written originally as an attack on Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, probably by John Skelton, entitled &#145;Godly Queen Hester&#146;. However, Pickering is the likely author of this attack on &#145;naughty Cromwell&#146;  (ibid., 292<i>v</i>), who in his poem was compared to Haman in the book of <span class="roman">Esther</span>, who ended on his own gibbet. The poem ends with a call &#145;diligently for to pray our king for to save and his undoubted wife Queen Lady Jane&#146;, but this pious pledge of loyalty was tempered some lines before not only by the undoubted urging of the commons to civil disobedience but by the ominous threat of foreign intervention&#151;&#145;I fear aid will come out of a strange land, the English commontie now may so be sure&#146;  (ibid., 293<i>v</i>). His poem enjoyed enormous popularity in the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire and, according to the prior of Bridlington, was heard &#145;in every man's mouth about Bridlington and Pomfret&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 12/1, no. 1019). It was undoubtedly the very popularity of this work which made Pickering a particular target of Henry's animosity.<br>
<br>Pickering was demonstrably active as well during the second rising instigated by Sir Frances Bigod in January 1537. James Cockerell, former prior of Gisborough, urged Bigod to show Pickering his journal in which Bigod had recorded his opinions of the questions argued at Pontefract. Pickering passed news on to Bigod of the attack on the Lancaster herald at Durham in late December. He carried letters between Bigod and John Hallam and was present at the final strategy meeting on 14 January at Bigod's home in Settrington, Yorkshire, between Bigod, Hallam, and Robert Esch, a friar of St Robert's, Knaresborough, in which it was decided to attempt the capture of the cities of Hull and Scarborough. After Hallam's betrayal and capture at Hull on 16 January, Pickering seems to have joined Sir George Lumley, son and heir of John Lumley, fifth Baron Lumley, in his brief occupation of Scarborough, and he apparently was still in that city when Bigod's rising collapsed shortly afterward.<br>
<br>Together with five others, Pickering was singled out for special prosecution by the king in a letter written to Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, on 22 February 1537. On 8 March Norfolk responded from Newcastle that he had not yet been able to arrest the friar. This event probably took place during the second week of March while the duke was in Scarborough, and Pickering was indicted on 9 May at York. Norfolk, however, was careful not to let Pickering know just how bad his case was. He wanted incriminating evidence against both Wood and his close associate Sir Robert Constable, and expected Pickering to provide it. On 22 March he wrote to Sir Thomas Cromwell, principal secretary, suggesting that &#145;if you handle [Pickering] with fair words you will get much of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 12/1, no. 698). Pickering went up to London under the illusion that he might still expect the king's mercy. He does not appear on the list of alleged rebels who were incarcerated in the Tower of London and so was probably held either at Newgate or at the Marshalsea. On Thursday 17 May Pickering was taken to the Guildhall and found guilty of high treason. He was hanged at Tyburn on 25 May 1537. What became of his remains is unknown.<br>
