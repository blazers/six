<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Loftus,  Adam</span>  (1533/4&#150;1605), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin</span>, was born at Swineside in the parish of Coverham, Yorkshire, the second son of Edward Loftus. His father was bailiff to the abbot of Coverham; Robert Loftus (<i>d</i>. 1606), father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16935/', "Adam Loftus, first Viscount Loftus of Ely (1568&#150;1643)")</script>, was his brother. His education at Cambridge University may have been at Trinity College, and he probably was appointed to the rectory of Outwell St Clement, Norfolk, in Edward VI's reign. He chose, however, to make his career in Ireland.<br>
<br>Loftus first went to Ireland as chaplain to Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, who was reappointed lord lieutenant in May 1560. Sussex's instructions ordered him to establish the reformation by putting into effect the <span class="roman">Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity</span> of 1560. Loftus played a key role in formulating and implementing the policy of enforcement, an extremely complex task in a country where the power of the Irish privy council was politically and geographically limited. In this he had the backing of two influential patrons in England, both with special responsibility for Irish affairs, Sir William Cecil and Francis Walsingham. As a result, Loftus survived the dispatch and recall of all the Elizabethan governors, occasionally even deputizing for them, and successfully maintaining a working relationship with all but one, Sir John Perrot. He was nominated Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh on 30 October 1562 and consecrated on 2 March 1563. He worked closely with Sussex during his lieutenancy (25 June 1560 to 25 May 1564) and with Sir Henry Sidney during his lord deputyship (20 January 1566 to 1 April 1571 and 18 September 1575 to 14 September 1578), the latter hailing him as a great religious reformer on his translation to the archbishopric of Dublin on 9 August 1567. Later governors relied on Loftus's detailed knowledge of Irish affairs and his political judgement. He served as one of the lord justices on three occasions: from 31 August 1582 to 21 June 1584, with Sir Henry Wallop; from 27 November 1597 to 15 April 1599, with Robert Gardiner; and from 25 September 1599 to 26 February 1600, with Sir George Carey.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticalcareer"></a>Ecclesiastical career</h2>Loftus was appointed chaplain to Alexander Craik, bishop of Kildare, by April 1561. Presented to the rectory of Painstown in co. Meath, he found that the distance from Dublin, where he was obliged to preach, made it impossible to fulfil reforming tasks in his living. Sussex's design to implement the reform programme envisaged a leading role for Loftus after his appointment as archbishop of Armagh. With the submission of Shane O'Neill (6 January 1562), the archbishop might act as a political watchdog there (like lord presidents of the queen's council in the north). To give the impression of continuity, Elizabeth I issued a <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i>, although this was unnecessary after the <span class="roman">Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity</span>. This stratagem to win over the Armagh chapter failed, as the dean, Terence Daniel, explained to the government on 2 September, because the chapter consisted mostly of Shane's horsemen. Loftus received permission to take the temporalities of the see from 30 October until his consecration. On 2 March 1563, in accordance with a royal mandate of 20 January, he was consecrated by Hugh Curwen, archbishop of Dublin. Dating his archiepiscopal title from 1562 insinuated a line of episcopal succession unbroken by the Reformation. The queen simultaneously appointed Loftus to the Irish privy council. He was in England for twelve months from August 1566 because of ill health due to the damp weather in Ireland, and was admitted DD at Cambridge University on 25 November.<br>
<br>Loftus could not act as a reformer in Armagh, because of the lack of control by the Dublin government over the area. Residing whenever possible in his official residence, Termonfeckin, near Drogheda, he complained that his temporalities were worth only &pound;20 per annum. During a visit to England he was granted (on 6 January 1565) the deanery of St Patrick's <i>in commendam</i>, to improve his income until other suitable provision could be made. Loftus duly resigned the deanery to the new lord chancellor Robert Weston, and was then finally chosen to become archbishop of Dublin. The appointment had been hotly contested.<br>
<br>Throughout his career in Ireland, Loftus appears to have hankered after positions in England, in order either to cure his gout or to work more effectively. This was sometimes a device to remind the government of his indispensability. To abandon Ireland would have been impossible, considering his increasing commitments there.<h2>
<a name="Familynetworks"></a>Family networks</h2>Starting his work with no local connections, Loftus realized quickly that he needed his own supporters. The secret of his success as a political survivor lay in his wide circle of influential friends. He married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1595), eldest daughter of Adam Purdon of Lurgan Race, co. Louth, and they had twenty children, twelve surviving into adulthood. Through his own and his wife's families Loftus gained trustworthy associates among the gentry and Dublin patricians. His wife's relatives expected much from his episcopal patronage. In times of crisis, he cited his family commitments when asking the government for financial assistance. Irish clans periodically attacked Tallagh, his seat on the edge of the Wicklow mountains. A nephew and some of his men were killed at the gates of his castle in spring 1573. In 1580, during the rebellion of James Eustace, third Viscount Baltinglass, Loftus lived &#145;in a kind of imprisonment in his own house&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/84/1). In 1600 he reported that his daughters, married to the sons of servitors in King's county, now wasted by the O'Connors, had sought refuge in his house with their families and were utterly destitute. One of his sons, fighting in the queen's service, was still unpaid at the time. In 1589&#150;90 times were better, however, and he had sufficient funds to build Rathfarnham Castle on the estate purchased from David Barry, third Viscount Barry.<br>
<br>Loftus's policy of promoting family interests made him vulnerable to accusations of covetousness, nepotism, and even neglect of his duties. Neither archdiocese yielded substantial or reliable financial rewards. He tried to make up for this by recovering church property alienated by his predecessor but apparently &#145;never gained a groat by any lease&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/72/52). He often asked for remission of debts and reminded the authorities that moneys were due to him. For example, as keeper of the great seal, he applied on 20 April 1580 for the 10<i>s</i>. a day to which he was entitled, because his 180 acres were not enough to make the necessary provision towards the education of his &#145;thirteen poor children&#146;  (ibid.). There is no doubt that most of his earnings came from his secular posts.<h2>
<a name="Puritansympathies"></a>Puritan sympathies</h2>Loftus based his drive for reformation on his preaching, for which he was renowned. Reformation of religion meant &#145;extirpation of superstition&#146; and ignorance, from which obedience and discipline were assumed to follow. He tried to recruit new preachers from England. Craik, after several unsuccessful attempts, warned the government that the livings were too small. Sussex too was aware that the problem lay in the inadequate remuneration of properly trained new clergy. In 1567 Sidney identified the government policy of giving the richest benefices to laymen as the greatest hindrance to the Reformation. The Reformation legislation of 1560 facilitated the more systematic use of church property to reward government officials in Ireland; bishoprics were treated as crown property. The benefices available to the preaching clergy were even worse than those in northern England. In addition, unsympathetic patrons hampered reform. These unfavourable conditions made the failure of the Reformation virtually inevitable.<br>
<br>As a religious reformer Loftus had obvious puritan leanings. During the vestiarian controversy (1565&#150;6) he recorded his disapproval of the harsh treatment of London congregations and Cambridge men, arguing that the compromise promoted by the Church of England was the work of the devil. Loftus implored Cecil to ensure that the good and learned preachers who rejected &#145;the popish rags&#146; should not be suspended. He was convinced that the restoration of &#145;the true and sincere ministry&#146; required the removal of &#145;all the monuments, tokens and leavings of papistry; for as long as any of them remain, there remains also occasion of relapses unto the abolished superstition of Antichrist&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/14/22). That Loftus went unpunished for his stance seems to have been dictated by the government's political opportunism. Armagh was strategically important, especially in 1565, when Loftus acted as mediator between protestant Scottish nobles and the English government. His puritanism was ideally suited to gain credence with the Scottish nobility who justified their rebellion against Mary, queen of Scots, by the Calvinist theory of resistance. Loftus's attitude ensured that the rebellion was treated as religious and not political in origin. He relied on his family connections to gather information and apply pressure, using his brother-in-law John Douglas as his messenger.<br>
<br>Loftus's puritanism also prompted his recommendation of Thomas Cartwright and Christopher Goodman for preferment in Ireland. His advocacy of Cartwright in 1570 and again in 1577 shows that he valued the preacher. Goodman, like John Knox, elaborated the Calvinist theory of resistance in his <span class="italic">How superior powers oght to be obeyd of their subjects</span> (Geneva, 1558). Despite this radicalism, Sidney supported Loftus in his efforts to secure the service of Goodman. Loftus was consistent in his support for the established church, though, clearing himself of allegations of separatism in 1567 by arguing that its structure was sacrosanct. What was established by law must be followed, except when dealing with adiaphora such as vestments. Although corresponding with leading puritans, he declared himself ignorant of the term &#145;puritan&#146;. An innovation such as moving the communion table out of the chancel and into the middle of St Patrick's Cathedral at Easter 1576 was not considered too radical, because the building was full of people and space was needed, and because this was done frequently in northern England. Loftus denounced his critics as papists and enemies of God in league with the pope. The articles of faith to be read by the Irish clergy were shorter and less precise than the ones used in England, allowing for a broader, more conciliatory interpretation of uniformity.<h2>
<a name="Reformbycommission"></a>Reform by commission</h2>Ecclesiastical commissions were the preferred practical means of reform. When Loftus was nominated to the archbishopric of Armagh he was also commissioned (albeit to little effect) to hear ecclesiastical causes on 1 October 1565. Other local commissions followed. In the next few years he co-operated most effectively with Hugh Brady, bishop of Meath. Forming the central plank of the Reformation policy during these years, they dominated ecclesiastical commissions. Brady, an Irishman, urged caution. Relying on a network of traditionally loyal local families, he did not wish to &#145;correct their heresies&#146; too vigorously. The instructions wisely allowed for personal judgement, and Loftus was content with outward conformity and consequent attendance at church services in which the new religion could be inculcated by sermons.<br>
<br>On 20 October 1563 the government appointed two Englishmen, Sir Nicholas Arnold and Sir Thomas Wroth, to assess progress, deal with irregularities in the payment of soldiers, and implement the religious legislation. Their devastating report associated &#145;blind ignorance&#146; and &#145;superstition&#146; with social disorder, but observed that people feared to offend. In autumn 1564 the more permanent high commission for ecclesiastical causes was established, recognizing Loftus's growing reputation. Against Brady's advice, in 1565 Loftus's main concern was the new commission's limited competence, since he wished to proceed against the refusal of nobility and gentry to attend divine service. When the commission was renewed in July 1568, the appointment of Robert Weston, the lord chancellor, was crucial to its success. That Weston provided the essential lay support and legal expertise emerged in November 1573, when Loftus complained that since the lord chancellor's death he was &#145;very slackly assisted&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/42/76).<br>
<br>In May 1577 the commission as a whole was renewed and the previous commissions revoked, but outstanding fines could be recovered. The instructions show a determination to assist the bishops with a very specific delineation of offences, revealing the failure of previous attempts to impose uniformity. They were concerned with heretical opinions, seditious books, conspiracies, scandalous words against the queen, absence from divine service, the correction of &#145;all heresies, schisms and ecclesiastical offences by censures, ecclesiastical deprivation, masterless men, quarrellers, vagrants and suspect persons, and all assaults and frays&#146;, measures to protect clerical marriage, adulteries, fornications, and other ecclesiastical crimes  (<span class="italic">Irish Fiants</span>, Elizabeth, 3047). The commissioners had the power to summon witnesses and impose fines and imprisonment.<br>
<br>From 18 March 1577 to March 1579 Loftus devoted much energy to fighting an ecclesiastical device which the bishops resented as infringement of their rights: a commission of faculties, issued to the lawyers George Acworth and Robert Garvey to grant licences, dispensations, and faculties arising from a Henrician statute. The stated intention was to remove &#145;the inconvenience of having to apply to the archbishop of Canterbury&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Fiants</span>, Elizabeth, 2996). These commissioners had power to check titles, prove wills, and exercise ecclesiastical censure and coercion, and their activities proved lucrative. The real intention behind the commission, though, was the regulation of religious reform to the advantage of the queen and her secular officials. The consequent struggle between the bishops and the commission was acrimonious, but ultimately decided in favour of Loftus. In spring 1579 Garvey and he were appointed to a new commission for faculties; and since the ecclesiastical commission became active again, both commissions were firmly under Loftus's direction. Garvey was one of Loftus's trusted supporters and ran the commission of faculties until his death in April 1580, when he was replaced by Ambrose Forthe. Any plan to suspend the ecclesiastical commission was opposed, even by the lord deputy, Sir William Fitzwilliam, since this would cause Catholics &#145;to swell too high against his children&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/145/49). The ecclesiastical commission concentrated on urban reformation. The bishops began visitations too. Loftus hailed the advances made in Dublin as a true preaching reformation.<br>
<br>The ecclesiastical authorities were especially concerned with the new generation of Roman Catholic bishops sent to Ireland by the pope. Dublin officials took measures to prevent Roman Catholic bishops from establishing themselves in Ireland, especially in the light of fear that they were preparing the way for foreign invasions. In this activity they were largely successful. On 8 October 1583 Dermot O'Hurley, Roman Catholic archbishop of Cashel, was presented to the lord justices, not the ecclesiastical commission. His interrogation under torture and execution under martial law in 1584, while associated with the lord justices, Loftus and Wallop, proceeded from Walsingham's orders, sanctioned by the queen and privy council. In September 1590 Loftus admitted to Cecil (now Baron Burghley) that there was indeed a fairly recent &#145;general disposition to popery&#146;, leading to disloyalty &#145;under pretence of religion&#146;, but before Perrot's second year as lord deputy there were only twelve &#145;recusant gentlemen of account&#146;. He added the revealing observation that, restrained by the ecclesiastical commission, they showed at least outward obedience and came to sermons and received communion  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/154/37). Towards the end of Elizabeth's reign, there was much self-congratulation over the course of the Reformation in Ireland. On 3 February 1603 the Irish privy council assessed &#145;Reformation by commission&#146; positively: impressive preaching, matched by a public lecture every week in the two cathedrals, made Dublin as good as any English city. Loftus was the driving force behind this.<h2>
<a name="TrinityCollege"></a>Trinity College</h2>Since ignorance was seen as the origin of all disorder in Ireland, the government sought to support the Reformation by founding a university there. This issue had become more urgent because continental Roman Catholic seminaries sent able priests to Ireland. The privy council, however, had never before considered financing an Irish university to train protestant clergy. The far-reaching instructions to Perrot of 21 June 1584 included the authorization to consider a possible rededication of the revenues of St Patrick's to endow a university in Dublin. Curwen in the 1560s had vigorously opposed such a plan. In June 1565 Brady urged recalling Curwen to England and making provision for Loftus so that he could resign the deanery and then a university could be erected. He had stated the Tudor conviction about civility in its extended form: since ignorance bred murder, robbery, and adultery &#145;with vices infinite&#146;, a university was necessary to save the country  (Shirley, 72). Loftus shared these sentiments, but as archbishop he needed no prompting to defend the integrity of St Patrick's. He agreed that a local university, the key to the reformation of religion, was long overdue, but the transformation of St Patrick's would mean that there would be no benefices for the preaching clergy. Loftus alleged that Perrot merely sought to gratify his ambition by creating &#145;Perrot's College&#146;. The ensuing quarrel was resolved by the queen's order forbidding the dissolution, after Loftus had threatened to resign his archbishopric. It is unlikely that his threat tipped the balance, but his experience of Irish affairs could not be dispensed with.<br>
<br>Loftus's own university scheme mobilized private interest. He persuaded the corporation of Dublin to make a grant of the priory of All Hallows and its park as the first practical step to the foundation of Trinity College, Dublin. His speeches to this end are the only remaining evidence of his style of preaching. When the proposal was sanctioned by Elizabeth, Loftus himself also subscribed &pound;100 towards the foundation. The charter of the college (3 March 1592) made him the first provost. On surrendering the office on 7 June 1594, to Walter Travers, a scholar of a strong puritan bias, he warned him to conform to &#145;the doctrine and discipline of this church &hellip; established by law &hellip; Both papists and schismatics are (tho' in different degrees of enmity) equally our implacable enemies&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 846, fols. 205<i>r</i>&#150;207<i>r</i>). His vision of the Reformation had shifted significantly from including puritanism within the parameters of uniformity to excluding puritans (schismatics) just as much as counter-reformation Catholics (papists) from the college.<br>
<br>Loftus's wife died in July 1595. He himself died at his palace of St Sepulchre in Dublin on 5 April 1605, at the age of seventy-one. He was buried in the choir of St Patrick's. His appearance and stature seem to be best captured in the anonymous portrait showing him as lord chancellor and first provost of Trinity College. He had stated his religious convictions in his last will, a rare account of faith unusual even among committed protestants at the time. He specifically renounced intercessions of saints and angels, and wished to rely only on the merits of Christ:<blockquote>which faith, since I was called to be Bishop and Minister of God's Holy Word, I have always both publicly preached and privately acknowledged, and I desire that this my Faith and Profession be made known to posterities hereafter as long as my memory be had of myself in this world.</blockquote>Even today Loftus's intentions are much easier to assess than his actions and his impact. He made many enemies, and their vocal criticism has often dominated the verdicts of later historians.<br>
