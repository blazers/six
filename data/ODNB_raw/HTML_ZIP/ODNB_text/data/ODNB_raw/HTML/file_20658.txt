<span class="headword">O'Keeffe,  John</span>  (1747&#150;1833), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 24 June 1747 in Abbey Street, Dublin. Little is known of his parents but the O'Keeffes of Fermoy and his mother's family, the O'Connors of Wexford, had lost their landed property through their devotion to the Stuart cause.<br>
<br>O'Keeffe was educated at the school of Father Austin, a learned Jesuit. From an early age he studied art under Robert West at the Royal Academy, Dublin, with his brother Daniel (1740&#150;1787), who became a professional artist. His formal education ended when he paid an extended visit to an aunt in London from August 1762. There he earned pocket money by painting and developed his interest in the theatre, seeing Garrick act at Drury Lane.<br>
<br>O'Keeffe returned to Dublin in 1764 and soon became an actor in the Smock Alley theatre company under Henry Mossop. On 14 January 1767 Mossop staged his afterpiece <span class="italic">The She Gallant</span>, which had some success in London when revised as <span class="italic">The Positive Man</span> (1782). During the next ten years O'Keeffe worked as an actor in Dublin, Cork, and Limerick, with some appearances in Belfast, Derry, Kilkenny, and Waterford. His one-act musical pastoral <span class="italic">Colin's Welcome</span> was premi&egrave;red at Belfast in 1770, and he compiled and adapted the pantomimes <span class="italic">Harlequin in Waterford</span> (1767), <span class="italic">Harlequin in Derry</span> (1770), and <span class="italic">The Giant's Causeway</span> (1770). When in Kilkenny in 1770 O'Keeffe advertised a subscription series of drawings of local views. He enjoyed a reputation for &#145;gaiety, wit, and cheerfulness&#146;  (A. O'Keeffe, xxi), and acted Gratiano to Macklin's Shylock. He played Tony Lumpkin in Dublin performances of Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> and wrote the farces <span class="italic">Tony Lumpkin's Ramble thro' Cork</span> (1773) and <span class="italic">Tony Lumpkin in Town</span> (1774).<br>
<br>On 1 October 1774 O'Keeffe married Mary Heaphy (1757&#150;1813), whose father, Tottenham Heaphy, managed the Cork and Limerick theatres. Mary was protestant, so there were both Catholic and protestant marriage ceremonies. They had three children: John Tottenham (1775&#150;1804), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20657/', "Adelaide O'Keeffe (1776&#150;1865)")</script>, and Gerald, who died in infancy.<br>
<br>For his Cork benefit in 1777 O'Keeffe produced David Garrick's <span class="italic">A Christmas Tale</span> with special effects, including &#145;the Giant in the Fiery Lake 20 feet high&#146;  (Clark, 107). That December John and Mary O'Keeffe travelled to London, where he sent a revised version of <span class="italic">Tony Lumpkin in Town</span> to George Colman, manager of the Haymarket summer theatre. It received six performances in 1778, and five the following summer. Mary O'Keeffe made some appearances on the London stage and John acted at Portsmouth in summer 1778, but in March 1779 they returned to Ireland. O'Keeffe quickly wrote an afterpiece, <span class="italic">The Son-in-Law</span>, and sent it to Colman. With music composed and arranged by Samuel Arnold, it was O'Keeffe's first real success, with sixteen performances in summer 1779. The role of the ridiculous castrato, Signor Arionelli, was designed for the bass Charles Bannister, who was known to delight his friends with falsetto imitations of Italian singers. O'Keeffe's ability to write rewarding parts for actors was to play a large part in his success. Colman visited Dublin in winter 1779&#150;80, bought the copyright of <span class="italic">The Son-in-Law</span> for &pound;40, and asked for another play. O'Keeffe sent his musical afterpiece <span class="italic">The Dead Alive</span> and Colman staged it in June 1781, the month in which O'Keeffe left Ireland for London, never to return.<br>
<br>In the mid 1770s O'Keeffe had suffered from violent inflammation of his eyelids and tried remedies which made the condition worse. His eyesight steadily deteriorated, his career as an actor was threatened and he grew less extrovert. He and Mary acted at Crow Street, Dublin, in 1780&#150;81, and at this time his wife apparently became involved with the actor George Graham. According to the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Five Hundred Celebrated Authors</span>, O'Keeffe &#145;demolished his wife's nose in a fit of jealousy&#146; and departed for London. Mary lived with Graham as his wife for many years and they acted together in the English provinces and Scotland. O'Keeffe arranged for his children to come to England and made himself solely responsible for their upbringing and education. Adelaide wrote that her father was &#145;never heard to mention the name of his <i>wife</i>&#146; and that after the death of his brother Daniel in 1787 &#145;the reserve of his character became confirmed and habitual&#146;  (A. O'Keeffe, xvi, xxi). O'Keeffe's very successful afterpiece <span class="italic">The Agreeable Surprise</span>, with music by Arnold, was the last work he was able to write without an amanuensis. It was praised by Hazlitt who called O'Keeffe &#145;our English Moli&egrave;re&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 5.319). The <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> (6 September 1781) reported that the whole audience was &#145;in one continued Fit of Laughter&#146; and particularly praised the comic actor and singer John Edwin, who played Lingo, the former schoolmaster who courts the ignorant dairymaid Cowslip with the song &#145;Amo, amas, I love a lass&#146;.<br>
<br>Thomas Harris, the Covent Garden manager, then commissioned a full-length piece, for which O'Keeffe received 600 guineas, &pound;120 of which he gave to Arnold for the music. <span class="italic">The Banditti</span>, a forerunner of romantic opera, failed on its first night (28 November 1781), but was an immediate success the following November when revised as <span class="italic">The Castle of Andalusia</span>. The strong cast included the contralto Margaret Kennedy in the breeches role of Don Alphonso, Giovanna Sestini in the tailor-made broken English role of Lorenza, and Edwin as Pedrillo. 25 November 1782 saw O'Keeffe's first Covent Garden pantomime, <span class="italic">Lord Mayor's Day</span>, a splendid spectacle with over 200 supernumeraries in the final procession and with music arranged and composed by William Shield. Meanwhile his <span class="italic">Harlequin Teague</span>, with music by Arnold, had been performed as the Haymarket summer pantomime, with a solo duet for Charles Bannister as a man with two heads. In summer 1783 O'Keeffe's first five-act comedy for London, <span class="italic">The Young Quaker</span>, was a success at the Haymarket; it continued to be performed well into the nineteenth century. He also provided lyrics for <span class="italic">Gretna Green</span>, a farce with &#145;Italian, French, Irish, Scotch, Welch, and English MUSIC&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 28 Aug 1783). Every year for the rest of the decade O'Keeffe had new works performed at both Covent Garden and the Haymarket, with music composed by Shield and Arnold respectively.<br>
<br>For the Haymarket O'Keeffe provided the afterpieces <span class="italic">Peeping Tom of Coventry</span> (1784), which remained popular for many years, and <span class="italic">A Beggar on Horseback</span> (1785). Another successful farce, <span class="italic">The Prisoner at Large</span> (1788), was dedicated to John Edwin, whose death in October 1790 was a serious blow to O'Keeffe, as was the mental decline of Colman after a stroke in 1785. The Haymarket management was gradually assumed by George Colman the younger, who was himself a skilful writer of comic afterpieces. O'Keeffe wrote for Harris at Covent Garden until the end of his career, producing two more successful full-length musical works, <span class="italic">Fontainbleau</span> (1784) and <span class="italic">The Highland Reel</span> (1788). His afterpiece <span class="italic">The Poor Soldier</span> (1783), adapted from his unsuccessful <span class="italic">The Shamrock</span>, was set in the Irish countryside and starred Margaret Kennedy as the soldier Patrick. The music incorporated some &#145;fine Irish airs of Carolan&#146;  (J. O'Keeffe, <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1.70), which O'Keeffe selected and sang to Shield. With forty performances in its first season, it remained popular well into the next century in Britain and the USA. A sequel, <span class="italic">Love in a Camp, or, Patrick in Prussia</span>, also did well. <span class="italic">The Farmer</span> (1787), which O'Keeffe adapted from his rejected play <span class="italic">The Plague of Riches</span>, was another success and included the song &#145;A Flaxen-Headed Cow-Boy&#146;, with Shield's delightful flute obbligato for the whistling boy, and a patter song for Edwin as the stay-maker Jemmy Jumps.<br>
<br>O'Keeffe's ability to rewrite failures into successes was remarkable, particularly in view of his near blindness. He provided words for the Covent Garden pantomimes <span class="italic">Friar Bacon</span> (1783, altered to <span class="italic">Harlequin Rambler</span> after sixteen performances), <span class="italic">Omai</span> (1785), <span class="italic">Aladin</span> (1788), and <span class="italic">Merry Sherwood</span> (1795). In spring 1791 he had two non-musical successes, the afterpiece <span class="italic">Modern Antiques</span> and the five-act comedy <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span>. The latter, &#145;calculated throughout to call forth the broad laugh and the tear of sensibility, alternately&#146;  (Baker, 3.410), has proved the longest lasting of his stage works. There were some Covent Garden flops, however. <span class="italic">The Blacksmith of Antwerp</span> (1785), <span class="italic">The Man-Milliner</span> (1787), and <span class="italic">Tantara-rara</span> (1788) folded very quickly, while <span class="italic">The Toy</span> (1789) and its revision <span class="italic">The Lie of the Day</span> (1796) had only limited success. At the Haymarket <span class="italic">The Siege of Curzola</span> failed as both a mainpiece and an afterpiece and <span class="italic">The Basket-Maker</span> (1790) received only five performances. O'Keeffe turned out pieces to celebrate special occasions, notably <span class="italic">The Birth-Day</span> (1783) for the twenty-first birthday of the prince of Wales and <span class="italic">Britain's Brave Tars!!</span> for the naval victories of 1797. There were also benefit pieces, <span class="italic">The Maid's the Mistress</span> for Sestini (1783), <span class="italic">The Pharo Table</span> for William Lewis (1789), <span class="italic">The Little Hunchback</span> for John Quick (1789), and <span class="italic">St George's Day</span> for Isabella Mattocks (1789). <span class="italic">The Czar</span>, premi&egrave;red at Mrs Billington's benefit (1790), was revised as <span class="italic">The Fugitive</span> in the following season.<br>
<br>After the success of <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span> O'Keeffe produced nothing for two years. In summer 1791 he took a six-week holiday with his children in West Lulworth on the Dorset coast and he later drew on this for his popular three-act Haymarket comedy, <span class="italic">The London Hermit, or, Rambles in Dorsetshire</span> (1793). The tenor Michael Kelly, who had appeared with him in Dublin in the late 1770s when O'Keeffe was &#145;a fine, sprightly, animated young man&#146;, dined with him in 1793 and found him &#145;broken down, and almost blind; but still full of pleasantry and anecdote&#146;  (Kelly, 2.37). His only other new Haymarket offering was the unsuccessful afterpiece <span class="italic">The Magic Banner</span> (1796). Covent Garden had been enlarged to seat over 3000 in 1792 and the enormous auditorium and increasingly refined tastes of the audience militated against O'Keeffe. However, the musical mainpiece <span class="italic">Sprigs of Laurel</span> (1793) survived for five seasons and its revised version, <span class="italic">The Rival Soldiers</span>, proved remarkably popular in the USA in the early nineteenth century. The comedies <span class="italic">The World in a Village</span> (1793) and <span class="italic">Life's Vagaries</span> (1795) and the musical farce <span class="italic">The Irish Mimic, or, Blunders in Brighton</span> (1795) did quite well. O'Keeffe's last collaboration with Shield, <span class="italic">The Lad of the Hills</span> (1796), had little success, even when revised in two-act form as <span class="italic">The Wicklow Mountains</span>, and the comedy <span class="italic">The Doldrum</span> (1796) received only eight performances. <span class="italic">Olympus in an Uproar</span>, his reworking of Kane O'Hara's burletta <span class="italic">The Golden Pippin</span> with music by William Reeve, had thirteen performances in 1796. <span class="italic">Le grenadier</span> (1789) and <span class="italic">Jenny's Whim</span> (1794) failed to reach public performance because of censorship problems, and the same fate overtook his only piece for Drury Lane, <span class="italic">She's Eloped</span>, rehearsed with Mrs Jordan in May 1798.<br>
<br>O'Keeffe hoped to provide for his future by publishing his four-volume <span class="italic">Dramatic Works</span> by subscription in 1798, under the patronage of the prince of Wales. Harris permitted the inclusion of the works for which Covent Garden owned the copyright, but Colman the younger, who had inherited his father's debts with his theatre, withheld five works that he considered too valuable for general release. Financial returns were disappointing and in June 1800 Covent Garden staged a benefit for O'Keeffe, who was led on by William Lewis to give his specially written address to the audience. In 1803 Harris agreed to make O'Keeffe an annual payment in return for his remaining copyrights and unpublished plays. O'Keeffe received a &pound;100 annual Treasury pension in 1808 and, when Harris's annuity ended in 1825, he was granted a royal pension of &pound;100 a year. He had spent lavishly on the education of his son, who took orders and whose death in Jamaica in 1804 was a devastating blow. Adelaide O'Keeffe acted as her father's amanuensis from 1788 and was his companion in his old age. It was to her that he dictated his <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (1826), when they were living in Chichester.<br>
<br>John O'Keeffe's last few years were spent in Bedford Cottage, Southampton, where he died on 4 February 1833. According to his daughter he took pleasure in their country walks and in verse composition to within a few weeks of his death. He was buried on 11 February at All Saints, Southampton. O'Keeffe worked always in popular genres and so has received scant acclaim from literary critics, but he &#145;gladdened the hearts of his auditors between twenty and thirty years and &#147;sent them laughing to their beds&#148;&#146;  (Baker, 1.551).<br>
