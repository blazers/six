<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morton, Sir  (Robert) Alastair Newton</span>  (1938&#150;2004), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 11 January 1938, the son of Henry Newton Morton, an oil executive who had emigrated from Scotland to South Africa, and his Afrikaner wife, Elizabeth Martino, daughter of Vintcent van der Bijl of Cape Town. His parents divorced while Alastair was still a child. Educated at St John's College, Johannesburg, and the University of the Witwatersrand (he was admitted when only sixteen), he left South Africa to study law at Worcester College, Oxford, on a De Beers scholarship. He graduated with a second-class degree in 1959.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Morton's early career until 1963 was spent in mining finance with the Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa, working in the Central African Federation. When the federation collapsed he eschewed the apartheid policies at home and moved to the United States. On 6 June 1964 he married Sara Bridget Stephens, a 25-year-old secretary of Rowington, Warwickshire, and daughter of Leon Edgar Stephens, a local politician. The couple, who met in Rhodesia, had a son and a daughter. After a short period as a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1964 he joined the World Bank's International Finance Corporation in Washington, where he was involved in providing support to the emerging French-speaking states of west Africa (mastering French was to prove useful in his later involvement with the channel tunnel project).<br>
<br>Morton moved to London in 1967, and worked for the Wilson government's innovative Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, which was given the somewhat thankless task of trying to revive under-performing British firms by rationalization and merger. Morton was part of a small cadre of young executives given a comparatively high level of autonomy, an experience that undoubtedly helped to advance his career. Leaving the corporation as it became a casualty of the change of government in 1970, he joined the 117 Group of companies (later Drayton Corporation) at 117 Broad Street, London, then led by the merchant banker Philip Shelbourne. He fell out with his boss and was effectively demoted when asked to head Draymont Securities, a joint venture with Samuel Montagu (1972&#150;6). But in this post he enjoyed a reputation for rescuing engineering companies in distress, and also found time to serve as a board member of the Royal Ordnance factories (1974&#150;6). He first attracted national attention as the founding managing director of the state-owned North Sea oil and gas company, the British National Oil Corporation, in 1976, when he was only thirty-eight. Headhunted by the chairman, Lord Kearton, for whom he had worked at the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, he revealed an aptitude for tough negotiating when finding finance for, and welding together, a new organization, which became one of the largest crude oil wholesalers. However, the appointment of his former adversary Shelbourne in succession to Kearton hastened his departure from the company.<br>
<br>In 1982 Morton emerged from the comparative wilderness of consulting and non-executive directorships (including British Steel Corporation and Massey Ferguson) when the Bank of England asked him to become chief executive of the ailing conglomerate Guinness Peat, which had acquired the respected merchant bank Guinness Mahon. He again rescued an ailing organization through a ruthless policy of rationalization and refinancing, much to the discomfort of its founder, Lord Kissin. By the time he became chairman in 1987 he had gained a reputation as a &#145;City dynamo&#146; and was highly regarded by Bank of England officials as having an appropriate blend of leadership and management skills. However, he was unable to ward off the hostile takeover of Peats by Equitycorp.<h2>
<a name="Eurotunnel"></a>Eurotunnel</h2>Morton's efforts at the British National Oil Corporation and Peats made him a candidate for the problematic channel tunnel project, and in February 1987 he became British co-chairman (with Andr&eacute; B&eacute;nard, and from 1994 Patrick Ponsolle, as French co-chairman) of Eurotunnel. His appointment was not welcomed unequivocally&#151;indeed many others had been approached before him&#151;and commentators thought that he might fail to resolve an extremely difficult situation. In the event his contribution was both critical and controversial. Morton's energy, enthusiasm, and appetite for public relations stood him in good stead when engaged on the relentless round of seeking equity and loan capital from worldwide markets. He was also able to recruit engineering heavyweights to his board. On the other hand, he was prone to take opposition badly, and his ebullience was less effective when negotiating with contractors, ministers, and civil servants. When he joined Eurotunnel confidence in the fledgling company was low. Expertise, particularly in the transport field, was in short supply, and three senior executives had left in the space of a week. Construction had not started, but already it was apparent that the interests of Transmanche Link (TML), the contractors, were beginning to diverge from those of longer-term investors. Morton elected to work full-time and quickly acted to turn the project round. Combining leadership of the board with the post of chief executive from 1990 to 1994, he succeeded in raising substantial tranches of equity and loan capital in 1987, 1990, and 1994, weathering the storms that these financial operations brought with them.<br>
<br>Morton's prime achievement came in November 1987, only nine months after his appointment. He launched a &pound;770 million issue of share capital (&#145;equity 3&#146;), despite the gloom created by the &#145;black Monday&#146; stock market crash on 19 October, and master-minded a &pound;5 billion credit agreement with a 200-strong banking syndicate. Also important was the railway usage contract of July 1987, which specified the terms on which the British and French railways would have access to the tunnel. Morton accelerated negotiations that had been drifting for some time. The deal he was able to reach transferred much of the commercial risk from Eurotunnel to the British and French governments. Revealing what was to become a characteristic appetite for brinksmanship, he leaned hard on both the British government and British Rail. At a decisive point he warned John Moore, secretary of state for transport, that the railways must be allowed to make a deal without government interference. &#145;Absent that&#146;, he said, &#145;and the Channel Tunnel may be dead within a fortnight&#146;  (Gourvish, 302).<br>
<br>Morton's battles with the contractors during the construction stage (1987&#150;93) proved less satisfactory, however. Delays and escalating costs were legitimate concerns&#151;indeed, they threatened the tunnel's viability at several points, but Morton's tactics cut less ice with hard-bitten contractors such as Jack Lemley of Transmanche Link. Equally fraught were his efforts to alter the terms of Eurotunnel's relationship with the two governments. Further financing in 1990 and 1994 required the active if rather covert support of the British government, but Morton antagonized civil servants with his complaints about the cost of excessive safety requirements. Patience ran out, particularly at the Treasury, when he and B&eacute;nard demanded compensation from the governments in 1992&#150;3, an action that culminated in an extension of the tunnel concession from fifty-five to eighty years.<br>
<br>The tunnel eventually opened in May 1994, a year later than planned, and with construction costs of &pound;4.5 billion (in 1985 prices), 64 per cent higher than anticipated in 1987. These overruns were acceptable when compared with other similarly large projects in the twentieth century, but the story did not end there. With project costs totalling &pound;10 billion, twice the original estimate, the debt-servicing burden was heavy. Traffic forecasts proved hopelessly optimistic, the ferries continued to compete fiercely for the short-sea market, and Morton and Ponsolle were soon pressing the governments for more help. In 1996 they were able to secure the basis for a revised financial plan and a further extension of the concession to ninety-nine years (signed in 1998), at which point Morton stepped down as co-chairman. There is no doubt that he had achieved much. However, he left a company with an uncertain future, continuing financial difficulties, and disgruntled shareholders. Furthermore, he had operated in an atmosphere of high drama and with almost continuous litigation, elements that did not help Eurotunnel's broader reputation. On the other hand he ensured that there was a channel tunnel. The company had been close to failure many times, and a lesser figure would have succumbed to the enormous pressures. In 1987 the journalist Ivan Fallon had forecast that &#145;a hungry, ambitious and ruthless man with a dominating personality, and a huge desire to make his mark, might pull it off&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 22 February 1987). This Morton did, though financial viability remained a problem to be tackled by those who followed him.<h2>
<a name="TheStrategicRailAuthority"></a>The Strategic Rail Authority</h2>Morton was less comfortable in his next, and last, big job. After acting as a government adviser on private finance (1993&#150;5) and on the faltering channel tunnel rail link (1998), he was appointed by John Prescott, secretary of state at the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions, to lead the new Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) for three years with effect from April 1999. As head of the SRA Morton was ostensibly charged with rescuing the newly privatized railway system, planning long-term investment, and awarding franchises. However, this time he was in his &#145;creaky sixties, rather than supple early forties&#146;  (Morton, draft article), and, beset by thyrotoxicosis and a bad heart, his capacity for long hours was beginning to wane. The post was heralded by the department as one for a &#145;high-profile champion&#146; of rail users, and Morton wanted the SRA to be a highly competent body: &#145;I refuse to be in a position&#146;, he told ministers, &#145;where a Treasury whippersnapper can claim more refined judgement than the SRA because it is full of anoraks and single-issue campaigners&#146;  (Morton to MacDonald, 10 Sept 1999). Operating as <i>de facto</i> chairman and chief executive, he tried to lead from the front, as he had at Eurotunnel. And taking his brief from Prescott's &pound;63 billion ten-year plan of July 2000, he called for &#145;investment, investment, investment&#146;  (Morton, speech, 30 June 1999). His vision included twenty-year franchises with investing train operators, special financing arrangements, and a reformed Railtrack (which owned and was responsible for the railway's infrastructure). For a time he seemed to have the backing of government. But it was clearly an immense challenge to lead strategically an industry without having executive authority, and Morton, who had little time for Whitehall, soon became frustrated. The high-profile railway accidents at Ladbroke Grove (1999) and Hatfield (2000) exposed Railtrack's frailties and were followed by a massive escalation in infrastructure costs, a situation which crowded out the prospect of enhancing the network.<br>
<br>Morton had little interest in budgets and failed to produce a strategic plan. Civil servants were soon criticizing him for stirring up unreasonable expectations. On the other hand, for much of his time at the SRA he was forced to operate in &#145;shadow&#146; form, since statutory powers were not obtained until February 2001, nine months before his early resignation. His failure should also be laid at the door of those who appointed him. He was clearly the wrong man, notwithstanding the impossibility of the job. His initial, optimistic expectations of Railtrack's ability to act as an efficient provider of capital for the railways soon gave way to a perceptive diagnosis of its emerging difficulties, though he persisted with the idea of a public&#150;private partnership with the company for network enhancement. Morton's belief that the train-operating companies would be willing and able to come up with long-term investment funds was equally misplaced. By 2001 he cut a rather sorry figure, sounding off about the inadequacies of civil servants, arguing with the rail regulator, Tom Winsor, about jurisdictional matters, and complaining with a degree of paranoia about the numerous leaks to which the industry was prone. Encouraged by John Prescott to believe he could make a real difference and would get the resources to make significant improvements to the railways, he was thwarted by the disjunction between investment aspirations and Treasury-driven reality. When Railtrack went into administration in October 2001 he left soon afterwards, recommending that his successor should be &#145;young, fit, wily and ambitious&#146;  (Morton to Byers, 7 June 2001). Like Peter Parker before him, Alastair Morton was attracted by the possibilities of public&#150;private partnership, and was involved in such combinations with the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, British National Oil Corporation, SRA, and of course the channel tunnel. Between 1993 and 1995 he was chairman of the Treasury's private finance working group responsible for identifying ways to engage private finance in the transport sector, which led to the creation of the private finance initiative.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>While the overall verdict on Morton's career was that he talked a good game and often promised far more than he was able to deliver, he will always be remembered for the part he played in steering the channel tunnel project to a successful conclusion. His sheer commitment to the venture while costs rose, timetables slipped, and the bankers grew ever more nervous evoked admiration, and the fact that he received a knighthood in the midst of the battle (in 1991) was testimony to his achievement, as was the award of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1994. A man of extraordinary drive and persistence, coupled with generous measures of charisma and wit, he was also highly adversarial, volatile, and even bullying. It was said that if you had breakfast with him you negotiated whether the toast was to be brown or white. An inveterate speechmaker&#151;while chairman of the SRA he admitted to a &#145;habit of making a policy speech every three months or so&#146;  (Morton to Corbett, 5 April 2000), he was in equal measure scathing in his criticism of others and extravagant in his ambitions. Yet behind the fa&ccedil;ade of the fearsome warrior he could be both kind and convivial, nowhere more in evidence than when he stayed to share a barrel of Young's beer after a locomotive naming ceremony. He loved sailing and walking, and was chairman of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, 1994&#150;2004. He died suddenly of a heart attack on 1 September 2004 at Deep End Cottages, Lower Hone Lane, Bosham, Chichester, Sussex. He was survived by his wife and his two children.<br>
