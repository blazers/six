<span class="headword">Jacob, Sir  (Edward) Ian Claud</span>  (1899&#150;1993), <span class="occ">army officer and broadcasting executive</span>, was born in Quetta, Baluchistan, India, on 27 September 1899, the second of two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34143/', "Field Marshal Sir Claud William Jacob (1863&#150;1948)")</script>, and his wife, Clara Pauline Wyatt (1872&#150;1959), daughter of the Revd Joseph Light Wyatt, a missionary in Trichinopoly. His elder sister, Aileen, died when she was eight. He was educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, before joining the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant in 1918. He subsequently read mechanical sciences at King's College, Cambridge, graduating with a second class degree in 1925. Meanwhile, on 27 August 1924, he married Cecil Bisset Treherne (1902&#150;1991), daughter of Major-General Sir Francis Harper Treherne (1858&#150;1955), of the Red House, Woodbridge, Suffolk. Treherne had been the senior medical officer in Jacob's father's division in France in the First World War, and Jacob had corresponded with Cecil since they were teenagers. He stayed with her family when he returned to Britain from India on his way to Cambridge, and they were married at the end of his first year. They were happily married for sixty-six years, and had two sons, John Claud and William Le Grand.<br>
<br>Jacob was promoted captain in 1929, and in 1931 returned to England to attend the staff college, in an outstanding year which was to produce fifteen generals. From 1934 to 1936 he was a staff officer in the War Office (promoted brevet major in 1935), and from 1936 to 1938 was brigade major in the canal brigade in Egypt. In 1938 he was promoted full major, and appointed military assistant secretary to the committee of imperial defence. The following year he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel and appointed assistant military secretary to the war cabinet. From May 1940 he worked closely with the minister of defence (and prime minister), Winston Churchill. Churchill liked and respected Jacob, who wrote the official record of all ten of his summit visits to Roosevelt, Chiang Kai-shek, and Stalin. He remained in this post until 1946; he was promoted colonel in 1943, and appointed CBE in 1942, CB in 1944, and KBE in 1946. His experience at the nerve-centre of the war gave him an invaluable insight into world affairs. At the same time it put an end to his professional career as a soldier. &#145;I knew I could look for no promotion&#146;, he said, &#145;because I had not commanded troops in the field in wartime&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 26 April 1993). Jacob had to find a civilian job. He retired from the army in 1946, with the rank of acting major-general (later honorary lieutenant-general).<br>
<br>By VE-day the BBC's European service had reached the zenith of its reputation. It had grown into the largest and most trusted foreign-language radio operation in the world. Yet by 1946 it was disintegrating. European statesmen and broadcasters returned to their liberated homelands. Newspapers reclaimed their journalists and universities their dons. Some staff were sent abroad as the vanguard of the BBC's own corps of foreign correspondents. Others joined the United Nations radio department. Moreover, the European service needed a new controller to replace Ivone Kirkpatrick, who had been transferred to the Allied Control Commission for Germany. Kirkpatrick suggested Jacob as his successor. It proved to be an ideal choice. The BBC's director-general, Sir William Haley, needed to arrest the seepage from Bush House, and to restore its morale. He also wanted someone with sufficient authority in Whitehall to stave off further cuts in the grant-in-aid which funded foreign broadcasting. As the new controller of European services Jacob made himself visible and approachable, regularly going to newsrooms and studios to watch the polyglot operation in action.<br>
<br>In 1947 Jacob was put in charge of all overseas broadcasting, with a seat on the newly established board of management, and a strong voice in the overall direction of the BBC. However, his civilian career was interrupted by Churchill's return to Downing Street in October 1951. The prime minister again claimed the defence portfolio for himself and persuaded the BBC to give Jacob leave of absence to become his chief staff officer and deputy military secretary to the cabinet, before setting off for a visit to Washington and Ottawa. On his return Churchill announced that Earl Alexander of Tunis, the retiring governor-general of Canada, would take over the Ministry of Defence. Jacob's enthusiasm was muted. &#145;Soldiers, however eminent, make bad ministers&#146;, he said  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 26 April 1993).<br>
<br>In June 1952 Haley announced that he was leaving the BBC to become editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, following the government's decision to introduce commercial television. Although he had been concerned solely with external broadcasting, Jacob was widely admired and, unlike some of the other contenders for Haley's succession, he had no enemies within the BBC. The governors appointed him director-general in October 1952. Jacob's regime at Broadcasting House (which lasted until 1960) covered a period in which television licences quadrupled, and radio ceased to be the dominant medium. He enlisted the support of the Independent Television Authority in a battle to remove the iniquitous fourteen-day rule. This prevented programmes from discussing any issue due to be debated in parliament during the coming fortnight. As director-general, Jacob cogently presented the case for the rule's abolition. Simultaneously he made sure that audiences were alerted each time the onerous rule had prevented a broadcast. By July 1957 reason, combined with ridicule, had won the battle.<br>
<br>Jacob rejected the notion that items of news should be suppressed because they were &#145;inconvenient from a short-term political standpoint&#146;. Nor, despite his Whitehall background, did he expect his senior staff meekly to accept governmental direction. When they visited the Foreign Office, he declared, &#145;They should seek to learn all they can, they should listen to the views expressed, but they should not act on guidance directly from Foreign Office officials without testing it by our long-term standards&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 26 April 1993). It was under Jacob's direction that the BBC survived the worst threat to its independence. During the Suez crisis of 1956 the prime minister, Sir Anthony Eden, tried to prevent the overseas service from reporting newspaper editorials critical of the bombardment of Egypt. Those who expected Jacob automatically to toe the government line were surprised by his forthright reaction. &#145;If the BBC is found for the first time to be suppressing significant items of news, its reputation would rapidly vanish&#146;, he declared  (ibid.). He was summoned to the Foreign Office and told that as a punitive gesture the Bush House grant-in-aid would be cut by &pound;1 million. Jacob and his chairman, Sir Alexander Cadogan, called on R. A. Butler, the lord privy seal, the next day, and managed to get the threatened cut reduced by half. At the time Eden was considering other ways of bringing the BBC to heel. However, during Jacob's absence abroad his stance was stoutly maintained by his deputies. After Eden's resignation that particular threat to BBC editorial independence was lifted.<br>
<br>Jacob played a leading role in the founding of the British Commonwealth International Film Agency, and of the European Broadcasting Union, and was first president of the latter. He retired from the BBC at the end of 1960, having groomed Hugh Carleton Greene to be his successor. He had promoted Greene to the board of management as director of news and current affairs in preference to Tahu Hole, the New Zealander whose malign administration of the BBC news division was widely held to be one of the reasons for the early lead of Independent Television News.<br>
<br>In 1963 Jacob was the principal author of the seminal Ismay&#150;Jacob report on the central organization of defence. The report, commissioned by Harold Macmillan and Peter Thorneycroft and implemented by Earl Mountbatten, led to major changes in the defence establishment. Jacob regarded the production of this report as the most important single act of his career. He held many offices after leaving the BBC. He rescued the Army and Navy Club from oblivion, and subsequently was its chairman for seven years. He became chairman of the Suffolk Police Authority, county councillor for Woodbridge, Suffolk, and deputy lieutenant. He was also chairman of the Covent Garden Authority, a trustee of the Imperial War Museum, a director of Fisons and EMI, chairman of Matthews Holdings, regional director for inner London of Lloyds Bank, and chairman of Sherborne School. He was advanced to GBE in 1960.<br>
<br>As director-general of the BBC, Jacob was overshadowed, metaphorically as well as physically, by those two titans Sir John Reith and Sir Hugh Greene. Yet he successfully piloted the BBC through stormier waters than Reith or Greene ever encountered. He was, in addition, the director-general who brought the BBC into the television age. His friend Sir Charles Richardson published a biography, <span class="italic">From Churchill's Secret Circle to the BBC</span> (1991), which made substantial use of Jacob's fascinating private diaries. Jacob died of heart failure at his home, the Red House, Cumberland Street, Woodbridge, Suffolk, on 24 April 1993, and was cremated in Woodbridge the next day. A memorial service was held in St Margaret's Church, Westminster Abbey, on 13 October 1993. He was survived by his two sons, his wife, Cecil, having died on 1 January 1991.<br>
