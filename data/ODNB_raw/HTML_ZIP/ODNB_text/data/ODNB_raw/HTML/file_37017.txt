<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wooldridge,  Sidney William</span>  (1900&#150;1963), <span class="occ">geomorphologist and geographer</span>, was born in Hornsey, north London, on 16 November 1900, younger son (there was also a daughter) of Lewis William Wooldridge, bank manager, and his wife, Helen Chadwick. His early childhood was spent in Cheam, Surrey, and his later schooling was at Glendale county school, Wood Green, London, where he enjoyed explorations in the countryside inspired by evening classes in geology. From 1918 he read geology at King's College, London, graduating with a first-class degree in 1921 and publishing his first paper that year. He began research in petrology, gaining his MSc in 1923 and DSc in 1927, but his research on the Tertiary and Pleistocene deposits on the North Downs and Chilterns showed an increasing interest in geomorphology. He became demonstrator (1922), assistant lecturer (1925), and lecturer (1927) at King's College, teaching on the combined geography and geology course which drew together human geographers at the London School of Economics (LSE) and geologists and geomorphologists at King's; the course became very influential in the 1930s in uniting human and physical sides of geography. In 1933 his increasing interest in geography made him one of three prime movers behind the foundation of the Institute of British Geographers, a forum for professional academic geographers dissatisfied with the Royal Geographical Society's continuing emphasis on exploration and on research by amateur geographers. A personal link with the subject came in 1934 when he married Edith Mary Stephens, a geography student at King's and later a geography teacher.<br>
<br>Wooldridge worked mainly on the stratigraphy, structure, and morphological evolution of the London basin and the Weald. River development and denudation chronology were particular interests, and his method involved meticulous fieldwork and mapping to identify complex features such as river terraces and erosion surfaces. His work was inspired by the theories of W. M. Davis on cycles of landscape evolution, and bore fruit in a number of research papers, a successful textbook, and <span class="italic">Structure, Surface and Drainage of South-East England</span> (1939), a landmark in the development of geomorphology. With his co-author David Leslie Linton he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Murchison award in 1942. This followed other awards which provided funds for the fieldwork he considered of prime intellectual importance and whose social aspects he relished. In the 1930s he began to publish on human and historical geography, probably influenced by his King's colleague L. Dudley Stamp. Wooldridge's interest lay in relating early human settlement to physical features. Linton again co-authored several of his important papers in the field. The south-east and particularly the Weald proved fruitful ground for his theses that detailed elucidation of the physical landscape was a prerequisite for understanding human settlement and land use, and that the geographer's goal was regional description grounded in physical geography with human geography following from it.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the Second World War, King's College was evacuated to Bristol and, isolated from his colleagues of the LSE, Wooldridge became responsible for both physical and human geography, a development which completed his transformation from a geologist to a geographer. From 1944 to 1947 he was professor of geography at Birkbeck College, London, where he enjoyed teaching adults, but returned to King's in 1947 as its first professor of geography. Wooldridge served as president of the Institute of British Geographers (1949&#150;50) and president of the geography section of the British Association meeting of 1950; he was on the council of the Royal Geographical Society (1947&#150;51), and was chairman of the field studies council in 1952. These responsibilities, combined with a strenuous schedule of examining and lecturing at his own and other institutions, led to a stroke in 1954. Reluctant to relinquish any activity, he carried on after a brief respite, but the strain under which he worked led to more difficult relations with colleagues. None the less, honours continued to come his way: he was made CBE in 1954 in recognition of his work on the government's sand and gravel council; in 1957 he received the Victoria medal of the Royal Geographical Society; and in 1959 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, one of the few geographers ever to be so honoured.<br>
<br>Wooldridge was a keen golfer and cricketer, a lay Congregationalist preacher until he converted to the Church of England late in life, and an enthusiast for amateur operetta. He died suddenly on 25 April 1963 at Halliday Hall, King's College, while on official college business.<br>
<br>The years following Wooldridge's death inevitably brought a re-evaluation of his work. Later laboratory techniques rendered his own, and his conclusions that followed therefrom, unacceptable, and later evidence on palaeo-environments made his assumptions look simplistic: but these developments he could not have foreseen and would have welcomed. More serious are criticisms of his reliance on Daviesian theory and consequent overemphasis on form to the neglect of process (though he himself was aware of this shortcoming of the Daviesian method given the prevailing lack of knowledge about processes) and on the identification of stages in the evolution of both the physical and the human landscape. Thus, although reissued in 1955, by about 1970 <span class="italic">Structure, Surface and Drainage</span> had become a classic work, rather than a statement of current knowledge, and his method of regional description had been largely abandoned by geomorphologists. However, his role as a pioneer geomorphologist was incontrovertible, and his calls for a historical perspective in and regional focus to geographical enquiry continued to inspire those who sought to unify its physical and human aspects.<br>
