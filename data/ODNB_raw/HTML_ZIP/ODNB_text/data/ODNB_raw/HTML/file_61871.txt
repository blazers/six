<span class="headword">Howell,  Dorothy Gertrude</span>  (1898&#150;1982), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born on 25 February 1898 in Handsworth, Birmingham, the daughter of Charles Edward Howell (1855&#150;1932) and his wife, Viola Rosetta Feeny (1862&#150;1942). Dorothy's father worked as an ironmaster in Birmingham; he was a self-taught pianist and was for a time organist and choirmaster at Handsworth church. Her mother was the daughter of Alfred Feeny, the arts and music critic of the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>. She had three brothers and two elder sisters. Her eldest brother, Charles, was a very talented violinist; he was killed in action during the First World War. The family were Roman Catholic, and Dorothy's younger brother Clifford had much to do with the working-out of the form of the English mass after the Second Vatican Council.<br>
<br>They were a musical family, and Dorothy Howell received lessons and encouragement from an early age. One of the first examples of her compositional work is a set of six pieces for piano, printed in 1911 when she was thirteen. Educated at convents in Birmingham, and also in Belgium, she went on to study with John McEwen and Tobias Matthay at the Royal Academy of Music. She was a gifted pianist and composer, and much of her work was subsequently written for this instrument, most notably the piano concerto, which was premi&egrave;red in 1923 at the Queen's Hall, London, with herself as soloist. Howell first gained recognition, however, in 1919, when her symphonic poem <span class="italic">Lamia</span> was premi&egrave;red at the BBC Proms by Sir Henry Wood, the work being performed four more times that same season and again at the Proms in 1920, 1921, and 1926. Her orchestral overture <span class="italic">The Rock</span> was premi&egrave;red at the last night of the Proms in 1928.<br>
<br>Dorothy Howell's style is essentially romantic, often drawing on nature and landscape for inspiration. The music is tonal, coloured by rich harmonies and chromaticism. Her output covered the whole range of instrumental, vocal, and choral genres. An early piece, her <span class="italic">Phantasy</span> for violin and piano, won the Cobbett prize in 1921. Her music for the stage included <span class="italic">Christmas Eve</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Sanctity</span> (1938), and among her significant orchestral works were <span class="italic">Two Dances</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Danse grotesque</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Three Divertissements</span> (1940?), <span class="italic">Fanfare</span> (1930?), <span class="italic">Humoresque</span> (1921), and a symphony. Her notable chamber works included piano sonatas (1916 and 1955), a string quartet (1919), and a violin sonata (1947), as well as a work for piano, <span class="italic">Spindrift</span> (1920), and <span class="italic">The Moorings</span> for violin and piano (1925).<br>
<br>From 1924 to 1970 Dorothy Howell was professor of harmony and counterpoint at the Royal Academy of Music, having been elected a fellow in 1928. In 1971 she was elected a member of the Royal Philharmonic Society. She was also a professor at the Tobias Matthay Pianoforte School. Having spent the early part of her career in London, she moved during the Second World War to Letchworth in Hertfordshire, where she lived with her parents, commuting to London when necessary. During this time she served in the Women's Land Army. Dorothy Howell was a founder member of the Society of St Gregory, and her church music includes several masses&#151;both Latin and English&#151;as well as motets and psalm settings. In her later years she had connections with both Ampleforth and Stanbrook abbeys. Howell wrote a mass in English for Ampleforth and seven pieces for Stanbrook, and gave the copyright and the manuscripts to the abbey; these pieces include a mass, responsorial chants and psalms, and an alleluia written for a celebration of the dedication of the church. Owing partly to illness, the majority of her later works were small-scale pieces for piano, voice, or ensemble. In her late forties Dorothy Howell was diagnosed with cancer, and although she survived many more years, her later life was clouded by periods of depression. She moved to Malvern Wells and eventually to a nursing home nearby, Perrins House, 28 Moorlands Road, Malvern. Howell died there on 12 January 1982 and was buried on 30 March at St Wulstan's Church, Little Malvern, Worcestershire, directly next to the grave of Edward Elgar, which she herself had tended. She was unmarried.<br>
