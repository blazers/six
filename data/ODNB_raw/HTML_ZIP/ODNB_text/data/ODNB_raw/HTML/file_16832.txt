<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Evan</span>  (1734&#150;1776), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 15 April 1734 at Llanycil, Merioneth, the younger son of John Lloyd (1693&#150;1774), gentleman, of Fron-dderw, Bala, and his wife, Bridget Bevan (<i>d</i>. 1746).<br>
<br>Lloyd was educated at Ruthin School, Denbighshire, and at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated as a scholar on 22 March 1751; he took his BA in 1754 and MA in 1757, but failed to obtain a hoped-for fellowship. Nothing is known of his life over the next four years. He was ordained, probably in November 1761, and became curate of St Mary's, Redriff (Rotherhithe), London, while continuing to haunt the theatres and coffee houses of Westminster. On 27 October 1763, through the influence of Henry Bilson Legge, former chancellor of the exchequer, Lloyd was instituted as vicar of Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd, near Ruthin, but he employed a curate there and remained in Redriff and London, his tithes and other dues being forwarded via his father. He made frequent visits to Wales, but stayed with his father at Fron-dderw, rather than with his parishioners in Llanfair.<br>
<br>Occasional poems by Lloyd appeared in journals before he published three substantial verse satires in 1766. <span class="italic">The Powers of the Pen</span>, in octosyllabic couplets, follows Charles Churchill in attacking critics and ridiculing Warburton and Johnson. <span class="italic">The Curate</span>, in heroic couplets, on the miserable lot of all the curates in England and Wales, includes some particularly scathing lines on the venality of bishops. <span class="italic">The Methodist</span>, nearly 1000 lines long, in octosyllabic couplets, and again indebted to Churchill, expresses Lloyd's detestation of Methodism, but is perhaps more strongly motivated by a venomous unexplained personal feud: the character Libidinoso in this poem is a wildly slanderous representation of William Price, former high sheriff of Merioneth, the Lloyds' powerful neighbour in Bala.<br>
<br>Price sued for libel. Lloyd was tried on 2 May 1768, was imprisoned for two weeks in the king's bench prison, and, on 16 May, was fined &pound;50; to add to his troubles his brother Robert died in September, aged thirty-six. On the other hand Lloyd made two valuable friendships that year: with David Garrick, on whom he called in February, and with John Wilkes, who by chance was a fellow gaolbird in the king's bench prison. Meanwhile Lloyd published <span class="italic">Conversation</span> (1767), an inoffensive satire in heroic couplets, followed in 1768 by a second, enlarged edition of <span class="italic">The Powers of the Pen</span> and an abortive plan to publish his poems by subscription. He also wrote anonymous anti-government squibs in newspapers.<br>
<br>In September 1769 Lloyd asked Garrick and Wilkes to help him obtain a nominal chaplaincy to a nobleman, as a device to evade a prosecution threatened by William Price for his non-residence at Llanfair. It is not known whether a chaplaincy or a prosecution ensued, but Lloyd never resided at Llanfair. He became a chaplain, but only to a sheriff of London, Watkin Lewes, during his year of office, 1772&#150;3.<br>
<br>In 1770 and 1772 Garrick unsuccessfully sought further church preferment for Lloyd, but the bishop of St Asaph, Jonathan Shipley, declared that Lloyd had to &#145;perform quarantine&#146; for his satires. Reporting this, Garrick's friend Mrs Sarah Wilmot wondered if Lloyd was &#145;too lively for his cloth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 2.357). Garrick's friendship was repaid in Lloyd's fulsome <span class="italic">Epistle to David Garrick</span> (1773), which was promptly and deservedly ridiculed in William Kenrick's <span class="italic">A Whipping for the Welsh Parson</span> (1773).<br>
<br>Lloyd was a lover of conviviality in London. During his annual visits to Wales he &#145;buried his talents in Ale, and at last, in consequence of sottishness, brought on consumption&#146;  (Fenton). He was also afflicted by gout and rheumatism from 1769. He died unmarried on 26 January 1776 at Fron-dderw and was buried in Llanycil churchyard; his epitaph in the church was written by Wilkes.<br>
