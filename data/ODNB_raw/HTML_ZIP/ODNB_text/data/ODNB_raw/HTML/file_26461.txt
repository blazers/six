<span class="headword">Stewart,  Andrew</span>  (1614/15?&#150;1671), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was one of the four children of the Revd Andrew Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1634) of Donegore, co. Antrim, &#145;a well studied gentleman and fervent in spirit&#146;  (Adair, 26). His date of birth is uncertain: according to his tombstone, he was aged forty-six at his death in 1671, but it has been plausibly suggested that this was a mistake for fifty-six, as he was old enough to recall witnessing in 1625 the effects of the ministry of one Glendinning at Oldstone, co. Antrim, who preached &#145;nothing but law, wrath, and the terrors of God for sin&#146;, so that his hearers, as &#145;I have seen them myself, were stricken, and swoon with the word&#151;yea a dozen in one day carried out of doors as dead&#146;  (ibid., 316&#150;17).<br>
<br>In 1645 or 1646 Stewart was appointed minister of Donaghadee, co. Down, but after the invasion of the English army under Cromwell he and many other presbyterian ministers fled to Scotland. In 1652, however, the attitude of the authorities relaxed somewhat, and in summer &#145;Mr Andrew Stewart, minister of Donaghedee, being then in Galloway&#146; felt able to &#145;hazard a visit to his congregation, though without licence, and upon that account was not checked by the commissioners&#146;  (Adair, 191, 207). Soon he and other ministers received letters from the commissioners of the revenue, who were prepared to license them on condition that they signed the engagement to the Commonwealth. At a conference in Belfast on 21 October 1652 the ministers promised not to agitate against the present powers, but they refused the engagement. The commissioners adjourned the conference until early December, urging the delegates to accept a specially amended text. On 25 October the ministers &#145;appointed a private meeting in a barn, and there Mr Andrew Stewart was appointed by the brethren to return to Scotland&#146; in order to brief and consult with senior presbyterian ministers there. On arrival, Stewart held discussions with Robert Blair, David Dickson, James Wood, and others, but contrary winds delayed his return to Ireland beyond the time set for the resumption of the conference. The engagement issue remained unresolved and the authorities very hostile, but it seems that Stewart returned to Donaghadee in 1653.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in the bitter division among the Scottish presbyterians, Stewart stood with the moderate resolutioners against the protesters, although he did recommend the readmission of the protester James Ker, who had deserted to the Independents but repented of it, to the presbytery in Northern Ireland. In 1654 Stewart was one of the presbyterian committee who met at Bangor and there framed an agreement which successfully prevented the Scottish controversy from leading to a fratricidal split in Ireland. The same year he was one of the ministers who sought from the commander-in-chief in Ireland, Charles Fleetwood, and the council at Dublin the right to the tithes of their respective parishes. The government, however, was set against this, and eventually Stewart and his colleagues in Antrim and Down found it expedient to accept a decision of 20 November 1655, by which salaries of &pound;100 p.a. were to be paid them by the Treasury. Stewart remained at his parish of Donaghadee until ejected in 1661 by Bishop Jeremy Taylor.<br>
<br>In 1662 the northern ministers found themselves the victim of a propaganda campaign which sought to paint them as rebels, complicit with the Cromwellian authorities. Three delegates, Patrick Adair, Andrew Stewart, and William Semple, were sent to Dublin with instructions to consult a friend of the presbyterians, Lord Massarene. In the capital from August to October 1662, they presented to Ormond a petition protesting their record of loyalty to the king and &#145;begging immunity from bishops and ceremonies&#146;  (Adair, 265). Earlier that year, however, Stewart and another Down minister, John Greg, had been visited in the north by Thomas Blood and William Lecky, who urged violent action to overthrow the bishops and the state. It is clear that Stewart and Greg had rejected these overtures, though other ministers were compromised. Despite the intervention of lords Mount-Alexander and Massarene, Stewart and six other ministers of Down were arrested in mid-June and imprisoned at Carlingford Castle, being brought to Dublin in July. Under questioning Greg denied meeting Blood, but, on the advice of Massarene, Stewart admitted it. His story was regarded as credible and he was soon given the liberty of the city on a bond of &pound;1000, whereas Greg was kept close prisoner  (ibid., 279). Despite these privileges he fell ill; eventually, in November, Stewart &#145;having some special friend, got liberty to returne to his house upon bonds given to live amenably to the law&#146;  (ibid., 283).<br>
<br>In 1670 Stewart was sentenced to be excommunicated by Bishop Roger Boyle but, following the intervention of the duke of Ormond and Archbishop Margettson, this was not carried out. After the death of John Greg in July 1670 Stewart undertook the continuation of his history of the Church of Ireland. Its third chapter, &#145;After the entry of the Scots&#146;, was published in 1866 as an appendix to Patrick Adair's <span class="italic">True Narrative of the Rise of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland</span>, and takes its story up to 1626. But already at the time he took up this burden Stewart was ill and unable to travel; he died, unmarried, on 2 January 1671 at Donaghadee, where he was buried.<br>
