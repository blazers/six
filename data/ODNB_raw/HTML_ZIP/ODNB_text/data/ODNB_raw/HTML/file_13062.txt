</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herbert,  William</span>  (1718&#150;1795), <span class="occ">bibliographer and printseller</span>, was born on 29 November 1718, the second of five children of Thomas Herbert (<i>c</i>.1691&#150;1721), a dyer and hosier of Gravel Lane, Southwark, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1748). His parents were Londoners and Presbyterians. What is known of his first thirty years derives from Richard Gough's obituary of him in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, namely that he was educated at Hitchin, went to India in 1738 with a cargo of pepper, as purser's clerk to three of the East India Company's ships; was stranded at Tellicherry, and, after a series of misadventures, returned to London about 1745; that, on his return, the East India Company paid him &pound;300 for his drawings of &#145;plans of the several settlements&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 65/1, 262) which he had seen on his Indian travels, which were later published. While in India he adopted Indian costume and grew his beard. He was &#145;in person, rather below the middle stature; stout, and inclined to corpulency. His complexion was fair &hellip; his physiognomy remarkable for an expression of sweetness and benevolence&#146;  (Dibdin, 1.87). Among his small eccentricities was that of always using lower case &#145;i&#146; when writing in the first person.<br>
<br>Herbert was freed by patrimony at Drapers' Hall as a dyer on 16 November 1748. Gough states that he abandoned his trade of hosiery and dyeing, and learned the art of painting on glass. There was a tradition of print engraving and selling in the Drapers' Company, and, combining his alleged experience as traveller, draughtsman, and glass painter, and with contacts in the trade and among nautical men, Herbert set up in one of ten newly built houses on London Bridge in 1749 as a seller and publisher of prints, maps, and charts. He bound and later freed two apprentices at Drapers' Hall&#151;John Pace (bound 3 August 1751) and Thomas Wright (bound 20 July 1756). Having witnessed a number of fires on the banks of the Thames, Herbert suggested to Captain Hill of the Royal Exchange Assurance that there should be a floating fire-engine, and published a proposal in <span class="italic">The Gazetteer</span>; his plan was later adopted. When London Bridge caught fire in 1758 Herbert had the initiative to publish <span class="italic">A chronological and historical account from the first building a bridge across the River Thames, from London to Southwark, till the late conflagration of the temporary bridge</span> (1758).<br>
<br>Herbert moved from the bridge in 1759 (the bridge houses were pulled down between 1758 and 1762), first to Leadenhall Street. In 1765 he took a house at 27 Goulston Square, Whitechapel, where he continued to publish and issue lists of books, maps, and charts for sale. In 1773 he bought a country residence in Albury Lane, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and added a library wing, where he used to sit, wearing a white hat, &#145;under a circular skylight, in the intervening period between each meal&#146;  (Dibdin, 1.75). Being then fifty-eight years old, having succeeded in business and made three lucrative marriages, he retired from trade, still keeping the Goulston Square address until 1776 when he sold off his stock and his chart and printselling business to Henry Gregory for 1000 guineas. He continued to reissue his publications and at the end of his life he sold part of his library through his nephew Isaac.<br>
<br>While he was still living on the bridge Herbert published the first edition of William Nichelson's <span class="italic">Sundry Remarks and Observations Made in a Voyage to the East Indies</span> (1758) and Nichelson's <span class="italic">A New Directory of the East-Indies with General and Particular Charts for the Navigation of those Seas</span> (1758). He reissued the latter in 1759, &#145;with additions, corrections, and explanatory notes &hellip; printed for the editor&#146; which started him on a method of publishing which combined business acumen with his love of research and book collecting. He would acquire the stock, copyright, and blocks of a work, then, incorporating new material, publish a greatly improved edition. Thus he annotated an interleaved copy of the 1765 edition of the <span class="italic">New Directory</span> (which was sold in 1798 after his death) and his writing and editorial career began to take off. The <span class="italic">New Directory</span> and <span class="italic">Sundry Remarks</span> published as one work went into a further four editions between 1759 and 1780. In 1765 he bought up the remaining stock and plates of Sir Robert Atkyns's history of Gloucestershire (1712), most of which had been destroyed in a fire at William Bowyer's printing office.<br>
<br>Herbert married three times; nothing is known of his first marriage, said to have taken place while he lived on London Bridge, nor of the second, allegedly to a niece of Thomas Newman, a dissenting minister in the City, &#145;a woman of weak intellect&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) who brought him a good jointure. His last wife was Philippa Croshold (<i>d</i>. 1808) who came from a prosperous Norfolk family with connections among the antiquarian circle who included several of Herbert's friends. She, too, brought him a useful fortune.<br>
<br>Herbert began to be active in the Drapers' Company after he was admitted to the livery in 1763; he was elected to the court of assistants and made junior warden on 26 September 1781 and progressed up the court until he became master warden on 7 October 1792. He was punctual in his court attendances until six weeks before he died, shortly before being due to be elected master. His thriving trade and City connections took him to Stationers' Hall, where he bound his nephew Isaac, son of his deceased brother Thomas, apprentice to the bookseller Samuel Hayes on 4 September 1787 with the very large premium of 100 guineas.<br>
<br>A heraldic book-plate, dated 1745 and engraved by John June, marks the start of Herbert's book collecting, and probably his return from India. He rarely used it, however, preferring to write his name or initials in his books. In 1760 he bought Joseph Ames's interleaved and annotated copy of the <span class="italic">Typographical Antiquities, being an Historical Account of the Origin and Progress of Printing in Great Britain</span> (1749) from Sir Peter Thompson who had acquired it at Ames's posthumous sale for &pound;9, together with the copyright, plates, and blocks. Herbert seems to have intended the kind of revision that had been so successful and satisfying with the <span class="italic">New Directory</span>; he thought to present &#145;the lovers of science&#146; with a republication of Ames &#145;with the author's own improvements&#146; in the interleaved copy &#145;and what further could be collected from my own observations, and those of my learned friends&#146;  (Herbert, &#145;Preface&#146;, 1.vi). In the event, the purchase revolutionized his life.<br>
<br>With Ames's work as a guide Herbert set systematically to work to fill the gaps in his collection of bibles and black-letter books. His livery company and East India Company connections, and the print and chart dealing, brought him into the centre of a bibliophilic and bibliographical coterie. Surviving correspondence shows that after 1760 he increasingly mixed business with pleasure, book hunting for friends who were also customers or fellow dealers, borrowing books, and, after 1774, offering hospitality at Cheshunt to other learned gentlemen with whom he corresponded. He was given free access to libraries which included that of the king, George III, and the great public collections at Oxford, Cambridge, and Lambeth. Whereas Joseph Ames had failed to gain entrance to the Stationers' Company, Herbert dined in their hall and through the good offices of his friend, the bookseller Lockyer Davis, was permitted not only to see, but to borrow, the three earliest volumes of their jealously guarded entry books and apprentice registers which he meticulously copied out. His transcriptions, which are now in the muniment room at Stationers' Hall, provided key material for his revision of Ames's <span class="italic">Typographical Antiquities</span>, which transformed it into the first history of the sixteenth-century English book trade and a major, even seminal work on English book provenance.<br>
<br>Herbert was an enthusiastic scholar: &#145;it was his custom to come to town&#146; from Cheshunt &#145;for a week or ten days during moonlight nights&#146; to take &#145;extracts from Caxtonian volumes in His Majesty's library&#146;  (Dibdin, 1.88), then to attend Drapers' Company courts, and the posthumous sales of those volumes whose &#145;owners had given me free access during their lives&#146;  (Herbert, &#145;Preface&#146;, 1.vi). In 1780 Herbert printed proposals for a two-volume edition of Ames but five years passed before the first volume of this edition appeared in 1785; volume two came in 1786 and three in 1790. Herbert was still at work at the time of his death and his own interleaved and annotated copy in six volumes eventually came into T. F. Dibdin's hand and is now in the British Library. Dibdin's typographically imposing reissue of Ames's work, with a memoir of Herbert and a few biographical notes, has robbed Herbert of the acclaim that should be his. Having expanded Ames's original single volume into three published volumes, Herbert continued to make manuscript additions which expanded his three volumes to six, making his arguably the most valuable of the three editions for study of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century book trade.<br>
<br>Herbert's collection of some thousands of books ranging from manuscripts and incunabula to contemporary works, which he admitted had &#145;employed no inconsiderable part of my life and, i may add, my fortune in forming it&#146;  (Herbert, &#145;Preface&#146;, 1.vi), rivalled many of the libraries he had used. It was sold by his nephew in three sales during 1796 to 1798, and volumes with his signature or, occasionally, book-plate are to be found in many libraries on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>
<br>Herbert died at his house in Cheshunt on 18 March 1795 and was buried in Cheshunt churchyard. His widow survived him and was bequeathed his house and all contents, except for his books, together with his South Sea stock and annuities.<br>
