<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williamson,  Peter</span>  (1730&#150;1799), <span class="occ">publisher and adventurer</span>, son of James Williamson, crofter, was born at Hirnley in the parish of Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. At the age of ten, while living with an aunt in Aberdeen, he was kidnapped by a merchant and transported to the American plantations, where he was sold for a period of seven years to a fellow countryman in Pennsylvania. After working out his indenture, he was given 200 acres of land on the frontier in Berks county. He married his first wife in 1754 (<i>d</i>. 1755), but in the same year his farm was overrun by Indians allied to the French and Williamson was captured. Escaping after four months, he enlisted in the British colonial forces and served along the northern frontier. In 1757 he landed at Plymouth, where he was discharged owing to a wound in one of his hands, and with the sum of 6<i>s</i>. he set out for Aberdeen. At York he published his memoirs, <span class="italic">French and Indian Cruelty Exemplified in the Life and Various Vicissitudes of Peter Williamson</span>. Arriving in Aberdeen in 1758, he was prosecuted for libel by merchants for his account of the kidnapping in which he exposed the role played by local magistrates and businessmen. He was at once convicted, fined, and banished from the city, while his tract, which had passed through several editions in Glasgow, London, and Edinburgh, was ordered to be burnt by the public hangman at the market cross. In response Williamson brought legal action against the magistrates in Aberdeen, and in 1762 was awarded &pound;100 damages by the court of session. He was also successful in a second suit brought in 1765 against the parties engaged in the trade of kidnapping.<br>
<br>Williamson settled in Edinburgh, where he combined the occupations of bookseller, printer, publisher, inventor, and keeper of a tavern, Indian Peter's Coffee Room, inside the parliament house. In 1773 he issued the first street directory for Edinburgh and in 1776 both wrote and published a periodical similar to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, entitled the <span class="italic">Scots Spy, or, Critical Observer</span>. This appeared every Friday and provided readers with local information; it ran initially from 8 March to 30 August, with a second series, the <span class="italic">New Scots Spy</span>, appearing from 29 August to 14 November 1777. In 1777 Williamson married his second wife, Jean Wilson, mantua maker and seamstress, daughter of John Wilson, an Edinburgh bookseller. The marriage, which produced nine children, ended in a bitter divorce in 1789. About the same time as his marriage, Williamson established a penny postal system in the city; in 1793 the government took over its management and awarded him a pension of &pound;25 per annum.<br>
<br>In addition to <span class="italic">French and Indian Cruelty</span> and the <span class="italic">Scots Spy</span>, Williamson was author of numerous works of which the most significant are: <span class="italic">A Brief Account of the War in North America</span> (1760), <span class="italic">Travels of Peter Williamson amongst the different nations and tribes of savage Indians in America</span> (1768), <span class="italic">The Royal Abdication of Peter Williamson, King of the Mohawks</span> (n.d.), and <span class="italic">Proposals for Establishing a Penny Post</span> (n.d.). Williamson also maintained his publishing business in these years. Among the works that issued from his press were editions of Sir David Lindsay's poems (1776) and of William Meston's <span class="italic">Mob contra Mob</span>. He died on 19 January 1799 and was buried in Edinburgh in the old Calton cemetery near the martyrs' monument, though his grave is unmarked. <span class="italic">The Life and Curious Adventures of Peter Williamson</span> (a reprint, with additions, of his <span class="italic">French and Indian Cruelty</span>) was published at Aberdeen in 1801 and proved very popular, running through many editions and appearing also in an abbreviated form as a chapbook.<br>
