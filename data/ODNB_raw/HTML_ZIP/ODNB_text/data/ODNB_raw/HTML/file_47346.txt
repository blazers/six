<span class="headword">Morris,  Claver</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1659, <em>d.</em> 1727), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was baptized on 1 May 1659 at Bishops Caundle in Dorset, the youngest of four known children (and second son) born to William Morris, rector of Manston, and his wife, Hannah (1632?&#150;1724). Morris matriculated at New Inn Hall, Oxford, in March 1676, and received degrees including the BA (1679), MA (1682), MB (1685), and MD (1691). In 1683 he became an extra licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. Morris was not a widely known figure in his own day: he neither published nor participated in any but local politics. He would have been remembered only by his family and friends had he not kept detailed accounts between 1684 and 1726, and diaries for March 1709 to March 1710, and June 1718 to August 1726. These manuscripts provide a unique glimpse into the life of a successful provincial professional man in late Stuart and early Hanoverian England.<br>
<br>Beginning in the 1680s, Morris practised medicine in Wells, serving as that city's only physician (although not its only medical practitioner) for many years. He apparently was an iatrochemist, developing remedies in his home laboratory which he dispensed directly to patients or distributed through a local apothecary's shop. Morris's therapeutic approach was conventional for the period, involving generous prescription of emetics, laxatives, enemas, sweating, and blood-letting. He performed no surgery, but referred surgical cases either to Mr Lucas of Wells or to surgeons in London or Bristol. He maintained good professional relationships with other physicians in the region, occasionally consulting on their cases or inviting them to serve as consultants on his own.<br>
<br>Morris's practice included patients ranging from regional gentry families to the poor of Wells, whom he charged on a sliding scale depending on their means. He visited patients in their own homes, sometimes at distances of 25 miles from Wells, travelling on horseback. At the height of his career in 1719, when he was about sixty years old, Morris was paid more than &pound;300 by the 258 patients who sought &#145;my advice and prescriptions in physick&#146;. Between 1712 and 1723 his annual earnings from this source averaged approximately &pound;250.<br>
<br>In addition to developing a substantial medical practice, Morris was a social and financial success. Indeed, he exemplifies one route to upward social mobility for talented, impecunious, young men of his era. Morris married well&#151;three times. His first wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Green, of London, whom he married on 13 October 1685, brought him two valuable London properties and &pound;400 in cash. She died in January 1689. In 1696 Morris married the widow Elizabeth Jeans, daughter of Edward Dawe of Ditcheat, near Castle Cary. She brought him property at West Pennard. Having borne him his beloved daughter Betty in 1697, Elizabeth died in 1699. In 1703 Morris married Molly Bragge, who came with a portion of &pound;3000. In 1709 she gave birth to his only surviving son, William. Molly died in 1725.<br>
<br>Morris became a wealthy man. He invested in property and lent money at interest. He augmented his property by requesting enclosure (carried out in 1722) of Baltonsbury Northwood and Glastonbury Common Moor. In 1723 his income from investments was nearly &pound;400, which, combined with his medical earnings, yielded approximately &pound;600. Morris enjoyed the lifestyle this income afforded. Between 1699 and 1702 he had a grand house built in Wells at a cost of &pound;807. He spent freely on household goods, clothing, horses, and entertainment. He set a lavish and hospitable table and, at 5 feet 6 inches tall and 15 stone in weight, apparently enjoyed its bounty.<br>
<br>Morris was well regarded in Wells. He held several local offices, serving from 1706 as commissioner for the land tax, and from 1709 as commissioner for sewers. In 1717 he became a member of the Company of Mercers and was made a burgess of the city of Wells. In 1724 he served as a district commissioner charged with collecting a special tax levied on Roman Catholics.<br>
<br>Like many educated people of his time, Morris was interested in natural philosophy, particularly chemistry. He regularly purchased books on this topic and ordered chemical ingredients for the experiments he conducted in his laboratory, where he also developed recipes for remedies and cosmetics, and constructed mechanical devices.<br>
<br>In addition to his other activities, Morris was an enthusiastic and expert musician. He sang, played several instruments, and was an active member of a music club that met weekly for many years. He also attended public concerts and musical gatherings in private homes. He purchased and performed pieces by a wide range of contemporary composers. He also owned a number of instruments and experimented with innovations in their construction and tuning.<br>
<br>Claver Morris died, aged sixty-seven, on 19 March 1727, of an illness which he diagnosed as &#145;a consumption &amp; a growing phthisis&#146; (probably tuberculosis). He was buried in Wells Cathedral, where a tablet was erected to his memory. His epitaph describes him as he would have wished to be remembered: the royalist and tory son of a clergyman &#145;who had suffered greatly in the King's cause in the Civil War&#146;; an accomplished musician; a natural philosopher, who understood chemistry, anatomy, herbs, and mathematics; a physician who invented remedies effective against &#145;grievous diseases&#146;; and a charitable, well-respected citizen.<br>
