<span class="headword">Clifford,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1421), <span class="occ">bishop of London and administrator</span>, had a brother, Robert (<i>d</i>. 1423), who was an esquire of Tonbridge, Kent, and was a kinsman of Thomas Fishbourne, anchorite and first confessor to the new Bridgettine nunnery at Syon, Middlesex. This is the total of firm evidence about the bishop's family, despite repeated and extensive efforts to link him with the great northern baronial family and with Sir Lewis Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1404), the Wycliffite, who was of an established Devon family. The future bishop, Sir Lewis, and Thomas, sixth Lord Clifford, were all in Richard II's household in the 1390s. Fishbourne and Robert Clifford both had some landholdings in the north. There is some inconclusive heraldic evidence. If Richard was indeed kin to the baronial family, there is no indication that this was significant in his career. A second Richard Clifford, who was archdeacon of Middlesex between 1418 and 1422, and received considerable patronage from the bishop, was almost certainly a close kinsman, but there is no evidence that he was the bishop's nephew.<br>
<br>The elder Richard Clifford was a graduate: a master by 1397 and bachelor of civil and canon laws by March 1398, perhaps of Oxford, where he later proposed to found a college. On 23 July 1380 he appears as a king's clerk, when he was presented by the crown to the mastership of the free chapel of Jesmond, Northumberland, a county where his brother had lands. By 1394 he held or had held six rectories and sixteen other preferments, most of them by royal nomination. Clifford was at the heart of the household, being clerk of the chapel and close to the king. He performed no external commissions. In April 1387 the king wrote to the pope on behalf of his &#145;dear clerk&#146;  (Perroy, 50&#150;51). Probably he remained with the king in the midlands throughout this year. He was with him at Woodstock on 11 October 1387 as Richard prepared to face the lords appellant, and was detained by them in the Tower of London on 8 February with a view to being tried in parliament. In the event, he was probably not charged, but he was released, by mainprise of three leading border knights, on condition of appearing in the next parliament, living in his own house, and having no contact with the king.<br>
<br>Once the king recovered his authority, Clifford was recalled promptly to his side and became keeper of the great wardrobe on 28 November 1390. Alongside his many preferments, he obtained the farm of the alien priory of Burstall in Holderness on 12 January 1392, bringing his brother in as co-beneficiary a year later. On 29 August 1394 he became archdeacon of Ely. On 1 December 1395 he was elected, presumably with Richard II's support, to the see of Salisbury, but the pope had already translated Bishop Richard Medford of Chichester, who had at least as long and serious claims to the king's sympathy, and was accordingly successful. On 23 February 1397 Clifford exchanged his archdeaconry of Ely for the more prestigious one of Canterbury. On 28 March 1398 he was admitted as dean of York. Apart from these three dignities, Clifford held no fewer than six further preferments at some time between 1394 and 1401. Throughout his career Clifford shuffled his pack to increasing self-advantage. On 14 October 1399 Henry IV would ratify his tenure of the deanship, the archdeaconry, four prebends, and one mastership of a hospital. At least half the bishoprics in England were worth less than these. Accordingly, since Clifford wanted to be a bishop, it was reported that he was even intriguing to oust Ralph Erghum, the veteran servant of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, from the see of Bath and Wells in the late 1390s. In January 1398 Clifford took pains to obtain a prebend in Wells as a base.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1397 Richard II appointed Clifford as keeper of the privy seal, as part of his extension of firm personal control over all arms of the government after his coup against his major enemies. This may well have saved Clifford's career. He was appointed an executor of the king's will on 16 April 1399, and an attorney for several of the leading figures accompanying the king's expedition to Ireland. He himself remained behind to help govern England in the king's absence, but he was not among the king's intimates at the heart of this caretaker regime. Accordingly, if still remarkably, he was not only able to survive the king's fall, but was reappointed without a break by Henry IV as keeper of the privy seal on 30 September. Furthermore, ostensibly by petition of the Commons in parliament, he was declared loyal on 10 November, notwithstanding his exclusion from the general pardon issued by Richard II's opponents back in 1388. He remained uncontentiously in office, and is found being summoned to the king at Leeds Castle, Kent, on 5 April 1400 to explain an existing treaty with the duke of Gueldres.<br>
<br>So confidently had Clifford adapted to the new dynasty that he continued his campaign to gain Bath and Wells. Once Erghum had at last died, Clifford gained papal provision on 12 May 1400. However, the king was supporting Henry Bowet, once as formidable a Ricardian careerist as Clifford, but one who had transferred into John of Gaunt's service and shared Henry's own exile. Bowet had gained election by the chapters. Deadlock ensued. On 2 March 1401, the Commons in parliament urged Clifford's cause, as having failed to gain Salisbury in 1395 and as an excellent keeper of the privy seal. The king responded that both candidates were excellent, and he would work for both of them. This is so rare an entry by either house in parliament into an episcopal appointment that the possibility that it was stage-managed must be considered. The Cistercian monk Tideman Winchcombe, formerly Richard II's all-night drinking partner and physician and reputedly also a magician, died on 1 June, leaving the see of Worcester available. Quite likely this event had been as long expected as it was universally welcomed. The king sent the monks a licence to elect on 20 June, and Clifford became their choice seven days later. He received custody of the temporalities five days later (2 July), albeit forfeiting at the rate of &pound;100 p.a. on 6 August to the royal household. The papal translation was issued briskly on 17 August. He received the bulls in London on 20 September, the temporalities the next day, and was consecrated in St Paul's on 29 October. Worcester was just about sufficient for Clifford in terms of income and status. Bowet, of course, took up Bath and Wells.<br>
<br>Clifford resigned as keeper of the privy seal at once, on 3 November 1401, as was often customary at this time, but he seems to have remained active as a counsellor around the government. Apart from January&#150;April 1403 (during which visit he was enthroned on 4 February), July&#150;August 1403, September&#150;December 1404, and March&#150;September 1407, he was absent from his diocese. During his spell of residence in 1404 he appointed proctors to the parliament at Coventry, having a rash of white spots all over his body and being quite unable to ride. On 6 May 1402 he had left London as an escort of Princess Blanche to her marriage (6 July) with the son of Ruprecht, king of the Romans. He returned to London on 29 July. In March 1404 he was appointed a member of the council, but was not included in its next formal reconstitution on 22 May 1406. It is possible that he was, at least by now, identified with Archbishop Thomas Arundel in politics.<br>
<br>On 22 June 1407 Clifford was translated to the see of London. He received the papal bulls on 13 October and the temporalities seven days later. He was engaged in extending the truce with Scotland in this year, but otherwise seems to have been little involved in government affairs. His only commission of any note was to hear an appeal from the court of admiralty on 22 August 1409. However, when Archbishop Arundel was restored to power in 1412, Clifford subsequently reappeared in attendance at meetings of the royal council. He also acted as an assessor at the trial of the heretic Sir John Oldcastle on 23 September 1413.<br>
<br>Clifford's public career was now in its twilight, and the accession of Henry V confirmed this. None the less, he retained full health. On 9 April 1416 he was even appointed to reinforce the delegation of the province of Canterbury to the Council of Constance, with letters of protection on 9 July. On 20 July he was also named as a delegate of the crown, an interesting piece of evidence that Henry V believed that Clifford would respond loyally to his policy of bringing the English &#145;nation&#146; to heel under collective episcopal leadership. Clifford arrived at Constance on 7 October 1416, and made such an impression that he was even considered as a possible choice for papacy. In the event, it was he who nominated Odo Colonna on 11 November 1417, and conducted his coronation as Martin V.<br>
<br>The mayor and aldermen of London, with whom he enjoyed good relations, urged Clifford to come home as soon as he could. Their reasons are unknown, but some oblique light might be cast on their appeal by the fact that his diocesan administration was in unusual disarray, with no fewer than five vicars-general in succession during his absence. As for himself, he gained licence on 19 April 1418 from Martin V to be allowed to appoint coadjutors should he become too weak or old to administer his diocese. He probably travelled from Constance to join Henry V in France, although his whereabouts there are unknown. On 20 June 1418 he was granted letters of attorney by the king in France because he was &#145;going abroad&#146; (that is, out of the Lancastrian realm). He is then to be found in Cologne in November 1418 and still in February 1419, presumably on royal business and once more dealing with the former Princess Blanche.<br>
<br>Clifford was still absent from his diocese on 10 May 1419 but had returned by 9 June. His public life was over. Martin V wrote to him on 27 April 1421, to express both friendship and anxiety for news of his good health. Perhaps the pope was moved by knowledge that Clifford's health was far from good. However, the bishop did not change the uncomplicated will he had made on 20 August 1416 when setting out for Constance, which suggests that his final illness was sharp. His burial was to be in St Paul's Cathedral or whatever &#145;honest&#146; place God pleased. Saints Peter, Paul, and Earconwald were invoked as special patrons. The bishop designated &pound;100 for his funeral and a marble stone, &pound;100 for paupers on his estates, &pound;100 for paupers in hospitals and prisons, and 1000 marks for poor scholars at his proposed college in Oxford&#151;which was currently just Burnell's Inn&#151;with &pound;40 to the master and fellows. His brother, Robert, was left plate and bedding, and was also named as principal executor, with instructions to reward the bishop's household and then distribute the rest of his possessions for the good of his soul. Clifford died on 20 August 1421 and was buried in the cathedral, on the site where the shrine of St Earconwald had formerly stood. There are many signs from throughout his career that his personal reputation stood far higher than official records alone indicate.<br>
