<span class="headword">Sumner,  (George) Heywood Maunoir</span>  (1853&#150;1940), <span class="occ">artist and archaeologist</span>, was born on 14 October 1853 in Old Alresford, Hampshire, the youngest of three children and only son of the Revd George Henry Sumner (1826&#150;1909), rector of Alresford and later bishop of Guildford, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38034/', "Mary Elizabeth Sumner (1828&#150;1921)")</script>, the founder of the Mothers' Union and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13191/', "Thomas Heywood")</script>, a Liverpool banker and antiquary. His other grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26784/', "Charles Richard Sumner")</script>, bishop of Winchester. Sumner was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he read classics and then changed to modern history, being awarded second-class honours in 1874. Two years later he entered Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1879, but he never practised.<br>
<br>During this time Sumner shared lodgings with W. A. S. Benson, a metalwork designer and friend of William Morris. Sumner was thus introduced to the arts and crafts movement, and became a keen adherent for the next twenty years. In 1883 he married Agnes, daughter of William Benson, barrister, and sister of W. A. S. Benson, the actor&#150;manager Sir Frank Benson, and the politician Godfrey Benson, first Baron Charnwood. They had three sons and two daughters. The middle son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36370/', "Benedict Humphrey Sumner")</script>, warden of All Souls College, Oxford. Sumner began his artistic career as an etcher and published two books of etchings&#151;<span class="italic">The Itchen Valley</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">The Avon from Naseby to Tewkesbury</span> (1882). In 1883 a new edition of <span class="italic">The New Forest</span> by J. R. Wise was published containing twelve additional etchings by Sumner. These etchings were produced with a detailed traditional technique, but during the next twenty years his style altered radically to one that verged on art nouveau. He illustrated editions of <span class="italic">Sintram and his Companions</span> (1883) and <span class="italic">Undine</span> (1888), both written by F. H. K. De La Motte Fouqu&eacute;.<br>
<br>Sumner worked in a wide range of other media which included textiles, wallpapers, tapestries, tesserae, painted gesso, and stained glass. Sumner became the leading English exponent of the technique of sgraffito, a method of decorating walls by incising designs on coloured plaster; he decorated eleven churches and several private houses in this way. The first of these was his parents' house at 1 The Close, Winchester, in 1885; he also designed and executed wall paintings at St Paul's Church, Winchester (1903&#150;4), later whitened over in 1962. His other churches included St Mary's, Llanfair Cilgedin, Monmouthshire (1888); St Agatha's, Landport, Portsmouth, Hampshire (1895); and All Saints, Ennismore Gardens in London (1897&#150;1903) which also contains examples of Sumner's stained glass.<br>
<br>Sumner was associated with the Century Guild from 1884. From 1885 to 1888 and in 1894 he was a committee member of the Art-Workers' Guild. With Walter Crane and W. A. S. Benson he organized the first arts and crafts exhibition in Crane Street in 1888.<br>
<br>At the turn of the century Sumner and his family moved out of London, and finally settled in 1904 at Cuckoo Hill near Fordingbridge in the New Forest. The house, the garden, and all the furnishings and fittings were designed by Sumner. His move to the New Forest and the forest itself were vividly described in his <span class="italic">The Book of Gorley</span> (1910). Probably disillusioned with the arts and crafts movement, Sumner turned to archaeology and during the next thirty years worked on sites in the area. His best-known excavations were those which he described in <span class="italic">Excavations in New Forest Roman Pottery Sites</span> (1927).<br>
<br>Sumner was a tall, strikingly handsome man with dark hair and a beard which turned white in old age. He died at Cuckoo Hill on 21 December 1940, one year after his wife. They are buried together in the churchyard at Ibsley, Hampshire.<br>
