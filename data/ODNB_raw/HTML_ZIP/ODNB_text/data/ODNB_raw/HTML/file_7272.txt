<span class="headword">Davies,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1598&#150;1614), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was born in Hereford, and states himself to have been a barber&#150;surgeon, although no trace can be found of him in the register of admissions to the freedom of that company. He states that he was a gentleman by birth and had served in many naval and military operations. His family may have had Cornish connections since he sailed from there and his brother settled there. On 28 January 1598 he sailed in a trading ship (the <i>Francis</i>) from Saltash, Cornwall, and reached Civita Vecchia, the port of Rome. He subsequently visited Algiers and Tunis. On leaving Tunis his ship was attacked by six galleys of Ferdinand de' Medici, grand duke of Tuscany. Davies was captured and taken to Leghorn, where he worked as a slave for eight years and ten months. For much of his time he was a galley slave and he recounts the extreme miseries of such a state. Indeed, of thirty-six men taken with him only thirteen remained alive nine years later.<br>
<br>In 1608 an Englishman, Robert Thornton, who had entered the duke's service after absconding with his English ship, was appointed captain of the <i>Santa Lucia</i>, one of three ships fitted out by the duke for an expedition to the West Indies. The voyage seems to have been conceived by Robert Dudley, the illegitimate son of the earl of Leicester, who provided Thornton with maps and charts. Thornton asked the duke's permission to take Davies with him as surgeon and physician, in which capacities he was said to be experienced. The duke demanded 500 crowns as security for Davies's working under Thornton's orders, and the money was paid by William Mellyn of Bristol, who happened to be in Italy.<br>
<br>Davies spent ten weeks in the Amazon delta area, mainly on the north shore, but his description of it is tantalizingly brief. The explorers found none of the silver or gold that the duke hoped for and Davies evidently considered the region more of a curiosity than a place which would repay further exploration or exploitation or settlement.<br>
<br>On returning to Italy in June 1609 Davies's ship was attacked by an English pirate, and an English sailor, Erasmus Lucas of Southwark, was fatally wounded. Davies landed with the body at Leghorn, and finding that Lucas would be denied burial in sacred ground because he was not a Roman Catholic, Davies proceeded to bury the body himself according to protestant rites. While thus engaged he was arrested by agents of the Inquisition. He lived on bread and water in an unlighted underground dungeon for sixteen days, and after a first examination was moved to a large open prison, the charge against him, that he had buried a Catholic according to protestant rites, having been dropped. An English shipowner, Richard Row of Milbroke, Cornwall, who knew Davies's brother in Plymouth, helped him to escape, and after sailing in the Mediterranean in the <i>Porrion</i> he reached London in 1614 and wrote an account of his travels, published that year as <span class="italic">A True Relation of the Travailes &hellip; and Captivitie of William Davies</span>. It was reprinted in 1746 in Osborne's <span class="italic">Travels and Voyages</span>, volume 1. This was the fullest account of the voyage, though only two brief chapters concern the Amazon and the Caribbean. Other information brought back by Thornton was recorded by Robert Dudley on a manuscript map, which was a revised version of that which Dudley had supplied him at the outset. The voyage did not stimulate further Tuscan interest, Ferdinand having died while the expedition was underway, although it may have helped to keep English interests in the area alive. Nothing further is known of Davies.<br>
