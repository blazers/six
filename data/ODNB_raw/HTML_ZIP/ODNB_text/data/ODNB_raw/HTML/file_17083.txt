<span class="headword">Lowe,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1385&#150;1467), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, is said by the Worcestershire antiquarian T. R. Nash (<i>d</i>. 1811) to have been a member of the Lowe family of Lindridge parish in that county. His namesake John Lowe (archdeacon of Rochester from 1452 until at least 1467), who was probably a relation, was described as of noble birth. Born near Droitwich about 1385, Lowe entered the Augustinian friary in that town, but in 1400 moved to the Lincoln house where, aged at least fourteen, he was ordained acolyte (18 September 1400) and deacon (22 December 1403). He studied theology in Oxford; by 1420 he was a master of arts, and received his doctorate in theology by 1426. In 1420 he obtained conventuality in the London house of Augustinian friars, and was its prior by 1423. He was prior provincial of the order in England from December 1427 to December 1433. He was provided to the bishopric of St Asaph on 17 August 1433, and consecrated on 1 November 1433. On 22 April 1444 he was translated to the bishopric of Rochester, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Lowe was a learned man and a strongly orthodox theologian, who before and after he became a bishop was a noted prosecutor of heretics. He was involved in the examination of William Taylor, burnt in 1423, of Ralph Mungyn and others in 1428, and above all in the condemnation of Reginald Pecock, bishop of Chichester, in 1457. He was also involved with the production of the detailed refutation of Pecock's errors written by Master John Bury of Clare, the <span class="italic">Gladius Salomonis</span>, and Lowe's learning and orthodoxy were praised by Bury in his dedicatory letter to the archbishop of Canterbury. On 23 July 1441 Lowe preached at the public recantation of the necromancer Roger Bolingbroke. John Capgrave (<i>d</i>. 1464), a fellow Augustinian friar, dedicated his <span class="italic">Corona super libros regum</span> to Lowe. John Bale credits Lowe with a number of sermon collections and theological writings. He also left many manuscripts to the library of the Augustinian friars in London which Bale and Leland credit him with having built up. Little is known of his period as bishop in St Asaph, but his register shows him to have been a conscientious bishop of Rochester. He attended parliaments and convocations regularly, but spent most of his time in his diocese, in particular at his episcopal manor of Halling, Kent. He was responsible for some rebuilding and remodelling of the episcopal palace in Rochester before 1459.<br>
<br>Lowe probably owed his introduction to court circles to Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1447). On 25 February 1432 he became confessor to the king, delegating his duties as provincial, and was dispensed from the liturgical rules of his order while at court. Although Gloucester may have been behind his promotion to the episcopate in the following year, it is also true that Lowe ceased to be the king's confessor, so his provision to St Asaph may have represented a discreet dismissal when Duke Humphrey's brief period of dominance ended. But he retained his connection with the court, where he was a noted preacher, and he has been suggested (by R. A. Griffiths) as a possible author of the treatise <span class="italic">On the Rule of Princes</span> written for Henry VI between about 1436 and 1442. In 1440 he was one of the twelve feoffees in whom all alien priory lands in royal hands were vested so as to provide an endowment for Eton College, and in the decade following was among the men responsible for overseeing various aspects of the development of Eton and of King's College, Cambridge. He was paid &pound;100 for his services on a diplomatic mission to the emperor Friedrich III (<i>r</i>. 1440&#150;93) at Frankfurt, Germany, between 15 March and 14 August 1442. Late in 1443 he became a member of the king's council, attending its meetings with moderate regularity. Late in 1455 he was a member of the committee appointed to define the powers of the duke of York as protector, and like many Augustinian friars, he adopted a political stance increasingly favourable to York. In June 1460 he joined the earls of Warwick and March at Rochester, and in the following month was sent as an emissary to Henry VI at Northampton. In the Yorkist administration established at the end of July, Lowe was appointed master of the mints. In February 1461, after the second battle of St Albans, Lowe formed part of a deputation from the citizens of London to ask Edward of York his intentions, and in the first months of Edward IV's reign he was one of the bishops who lent money to the new king.<br>
<br>According to Hardy's edition of Le Neve's <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, in 1465 Edward IV wrote to the pope seeking his permission for the aged and infirm Lowe to resign. However, Lowe died in 1467, probably in September and certainly by 21 November, at Halling, before permission could be obtained. His will, dated 15 August 1467, includes bequests to his cathedral of vestments and a &#145;beautiful chalice&#146; depicting Christ and his apostles. He was buried in an inscribed tomb (later moved), sited before the &#145;golden image of St Andrew&#146; opposite the bishop's chair in Rochester Cathedral.<br>
