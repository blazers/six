<span class="headword">Watkins,  Winifred May</span>  (1924&#150;2003), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 6 August 1924 at 116 Coningham Road, Hammersmith, London, the second daughter of Albert Edward Watkins, a process engraver for a firm that worked for newspapers, and his wife, Annie Bertha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Delia. Her family had no apparent scientific connections. She was educated at St Stephen's parish elementary school in Shepherd's Bush, whence at the age of eleven she gained a London county scholarship to the Godolphin and Latymer Girls' School in Hammersmith. At the outbreak of the Second World War the school was evacuated to Newbury but with some other pupils she returned a year later and gained her higher school certificate in 1942. Following a government decree she now had two choices: service in the forces or a job approved by the Ministry of Labour which included working as a laboratory assistant. She chose the latter and was taken on by the biochemistry department of the Lister Institute. This turned out to be a wonderful move for her. It brought her into contact with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/89447/', "Walter Morgan")</script>, who soon realized her great potential and became her lifelong mentor and friend.<br>
<br>The biochemistry department was the only one in the Lister Institute which remained in Chelsea throughout the war. Watkins described this time as particularly happy, despite the fact that physical conditions were adverse, some laboratories, for example, having few intact windows. Aerial bombardment tended to break down social barriers and she gained greatly from her contacts with eminent scientists. During this period, she enrolled for evening classes at Chelsea Polytechnic, while continuing to be fully employed at the Lister. In 1947 she was awarded a BSc honours degree in chemistry by London University.<br>
<br>Watkins appears to have started work with Walter Morgan almost from the time of joining the institute and her name appeared with his on two papers published in 1944. In 1940 Morgan had begun work on the red cell antigens of the most important human blood group system, ABO, and soon embarked on the quest of unravelling their chemical structure. Watkins eventually became a full-time partner in this enterprise but, before that, she spent three years doing a PhD, on the action of nitrogen mustards (cytotoxic agents then used to treat myeloid leukaemia) on the immunological properties of body proteins, at St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school with the immunochemist Arthur Wormall. After the award of her doctorate, she returned to the Lister to work with Morgan in the biochemistry department.<br>
<br>An early and highly important step in Watkins's work with Morgan was the realization that A and B antigenic determinants are carbohydrates and are therefore not themselves gene products. The <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> genes code for the formation of enzymes (transferases) which convert precursor substances into antigens. The nature of the determinant sugars which confer antigenic specificity was discovered by inhibition experiments, for example by showing that galactose specifically inhibits the reaction between B and anti-B. There is no <i>O</i> gene but the gene <i>H</i> codes for H substance, the precursor of A and B, which is more abundant on O cells than others. Other closely related genes are <i>Lewis</i> and <i>Secretor</i>. One of Watkins's most brilliant achievements was to propose genetical pathways in which the genes of these various systems acted sequentially. Virtually every one of Watkins's predictions was eventually shown to be correct, in many cases by her own work. The insights she achieved were doubtless due partly to the knowledge about glycosyltransferases which she acquired at the University of California at Berkeley during a sabbatical in 1960&#150;61. The work of Watkins and Morgan is the more remarkable when one considers that it was done at the very dawn of molecular biology, without any of the tools which were soon to become available.<br>
<br>When the Lister Institute closed in 1975 Watkins (who had been made a reader in biochemistry at the University of London in 1965, and professor in 1968) moved to Northwick Park, where the Medical Research Council established a division of immunochemical genetics with her as its head. During this period she made many important discoveries: for example, that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> transferases have overlapping specificities, and that unexpected antigenic determinants appear on malignant cells due to the lack of normal transferases. After the closure of the division at Northwick Park in 1989 she continued her work in the haematology department at Hammersmith Hospital until her retirement in 2000.<br>
<br>Watkins received many honours: she was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1969, became a member of council of the Royal Society from 1984 to 1986, and received its royal medal in 1988. Other awards included the Landsteiner memorial award (jointly) in 1967, the Ehrlich-Ludwig Darmst&auml;dter prize (jointly) in 1969, and an honorary DSc from Utrecht in 1990.<br>
<br>Watkins had a most engaging personality; she exuded an almost serene air. Although she was shy, she made friends easily and was always cheerful. She never married, but had three nieces of whom she was very fond, and a wide circle of acquaintances. Nevertheless, the scientific life meant most to her. When she had her first stroke in her late seventies she was still taking an intense interest in her field and one of her chief concerns was that she would be unable to take the chair at a scientific symposium, due a week or two later. She died of pneumonia following another stroke, on 3 October 2003, at Ashford Hospital, Stanwell, Surrey.<br>
