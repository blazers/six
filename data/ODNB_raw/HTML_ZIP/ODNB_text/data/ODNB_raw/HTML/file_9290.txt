<span class="headword">Fenner,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1593?), <span class="occ">sea captain</span>, is of unknown parentage; his origins are difficult to determine because there were several Sussex men of that name at the time. He is usually described as coming from Chichester, of the same merchant family as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9289/', "George Fenner")</script>, and probably his cousin. However, the first time he appears in public, in connection with a trading voyage to Guinea in which he was a partner (1564), he describes himself as &#145;Thomas Fenner of Erneley in the County of Sussex, gent.&#146;. A victualler of that name spent a week in the Fleet prison in 1580 for selling ordnance to the Spaniards, and the member returned to parliament for New Shoreham on 10 November 1584 was also called Thomas Fenner, but it is not likely that either of these was the same man as the sea captain.<br>
<br>By the time that Fenner captained the <i>Elizabeth Bonaventure</i> on Francis Drake's expedition to the West Indies in 1585, he was described as a &#145;veteran&#146;, but there are no clear records of how he acquired that experience. Perhaps he was just better than George at keeping out of trouble. He served with distinction on that voyage, and seems to have been a trusted friend of Drake. Two years later he captained the <i>Dreadnaught</i> in the expedition against Cadiz, and was trusted to report directly to Sir Francis Walsingham, both before the fleet sailed and also after success had been achieved. Against the Armada he captained the <i>Nonpareil</i> under Drake's command, and as vice-admiral reported regularly to Walsingham throughout the campaign. He was a member of Lord Howard's council of war, and took part in the attempt to intercept the enemy on the Spanish coast, which was frustrated by bad weather. He served with distinction, and according to one Spanish report was knighted as a reward, but this does not seem to have been the case.<br>
<br>In 1589 Fenner again served under Drake in the Lisbon expedition, and on this occasion was designated to assume command of the fleet if Sir Francis became incapacitated. He played a leading and active part in the campaign, of which he left a record in letters to Lord Burghley, Walsingham, and Francis Bacon, but seems to have attracted none of the blame for its failure. He was, however, somewhat disillusioned with service to the crown, which he complained had left him &pound;1800 out of pocket, and informed Walsingham that he intended to bestow the remainder of his fortune on a voyage to the Indies. Whether he did that is unclear. In 1591 he &#145;promoted&#146; (or financially sponsored) three ships in partnership with one John Bird, and in 1593 appears to have been involved in the transportation of troops to Brittany. If this Captain Fenner (his usual designation) was the same man, then he disappears from the records after November 1593, and may have died at about that time. Nothing is known about his private life, but if he was the Captain Fenner of 1593, then he had married, because it was then explained that in his absence from his duties (unspecified) at Chatham, his son had performed them on his behalf.<br>
