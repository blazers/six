<span class="headword">Sieff,  Rebecca Dora</span>  (1890&#150;1966), <span class="occ">feminist and Zionist</span>, was born on 23 February 1890 at 38 Copenhagen Street, Leeds, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39027/', "Michael Marks (1859&#150;1907)")</script>, founder of the Marks and Spencer retailing group, and his wife, Hannah Cohen. At the time of Rebecca's birth her mother, being illiterate, inscribed the birth certificate with a tiny cross. There was one son, Simon, born two years before Rebecca, who was always destined to take over the business, and three younger sisters. In 1894 the family settled in Manchester, where Michael Marks rented his first high-street shop. By this time he had joined forces with Tom Spencer, his cashier, and in 1903 the firm of Marks and Spencer Ltd was registered.<br>
<br>As the business prospered Rebecca was able to attend Manchester High School for Girls, a non-denominational school of high academic standing which encouraged women's higher education. In 1908 she enrolled to study English literature at Manchester University and on 15 June 1910, aged twenty, married 21-year-old <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31682/', "Israel Moses Sieff (1889&#150;1972)")</script>&#151;an economics graduate from Manchester University and also the son of a Lithuanian refugee pedlar&#151;on the roof of Manchester's Midland Hotel. They had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Manchester's spectacular growth in the nineteenth century as a centre for business, commerce, and the chemical industry attracted enormous Jewish settlement as the great wave of Russian pogroms broke out. In the years before the First World War key friendships were made between Chaim Weizmann, a brilliant young scientist appointed reader in chemistry at Manchester University, his wife, Vera, and C. P. Scott, editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. At the same time as Weizmann won the sympathetic ear of politicians such as Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George, and Arthur James Balfour, he was forging close friendships with the Sieff and Marks families, who by this time had sufficient financial resources and business skills to help promote his Zionist ideas.<br>
<br>Although there were, from at least 1909, various women's groups and individuals working for the welfare of women and girls in Palestine, Rebecca Sieff took the lead in the struggle to weld them into one force which would ultimately be active in the practical work of building the state of Israel. Her approach to the Zionist movement was much influenced by what she witnessed in the suffragette movement, for she campaigned also for votes for women, equal pay and working conditions, equality of opportunity within trades and professions, and for the economic independence of women. Although the relationship with the English Zionist Federation (EZF) was always slightly uneasy as some felt that the splitting away of the female workers could only weaken the whole, Rebecca was adamant that for women to take part on an equal basis they must organize and work as women and not as an adjunct to the men's movement.<br>
<br>In early 1919 Sieff, together with Vera Weizmann, Olga Alman, and Romana Goodman, finally persuaded the EZF leadership to allow the formation of a separate women's federation. Sieff was elected their first president, and in July 1920, following her first visit to Palestine, the Women's International Zionist Organisation (WIZO) was formed in London &#145;to promote the welfare of women and children in Palestine and to carry out specific works in the reconstruction of Palestine&#146;, according to the words of the official resolution.<br>
<br>In 1926 Israel and Rebecca Sieff and their four children&#151;Michael, Marcus, Daniel, and Judith&#151;moved to London, where Rebecca became well known as an elegant society hostess organizing balls and galas for Jewish and non-Jewish events. In 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany, she immediately established the women's appeal committee of the central British fund to rescue thousands of women and children from Nazi-dominated Europe. But that year personal tragedy struck too when their son Daniel died. The family founded a scientific research institute in his honour, known today as the Weizmann Institute of Science at Rehovot, Israel. During the 1930s Sieff travelled around the world for Zionist and anti-Nazi causes but she also campaigned vigorously for fuller parliamentary representation of women via the Women for Westminster group, which she founded, as well as demanding equal compensation for civilian women injured in bombing, equal rights in welfare and legal status.<br>
<br>In June 1946 Sieff headed a march to Downing Street of 200 women protesting against the British government's raid on the Jewish Agency's office in Jerusalem. In September she spent time with holocaust survivors still living in a displaced persons' camp at Bergen-Belsen and two months later, in an impassioned speech to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, demanded both the rescue of Jews stranded in displaced persons' camps and the immediate establishment of the Jewish state.<br>
<br>Following the proclamation of Israeli independence in 1948, Rebecca Sieff made Israel her permanent home. The years after independence demanded great flexibility within WIZO, of which she had been world president since 1920, as waves of immigrants flooded the new country and the organization placed more emphasis on traditionally &#145;female&#146; issues, especially the care of home and family, while Sieff continued to fight for women's political rights.<br>
<br>In 1956 a bomb at Sieff's home in Tel Mond killed her gardener, but she was unhurt. In 1960 the British government appointed her an OBE and, three years later, when she resigned her executive position in WIZO, she was appointed honorary life president. She died at the Ichilov Hospital, Tel Aviv, Israel, on 8 January 1966, a few days after her husband, Israel, had been created a life peer. She was buried on 10 January at Tel Mond.<br>
<br>Sieff's level of commitment and her concentration on the struggle for women's rights in a male-dominated Zionist movement marked her out from the start among Zionist philanthropists. Yet, in common with many nineteenth-century pioneers of women's rights, while she promoted the centrality of the family in women's lives, her many involvements inevitably took her away from her own family for long periods.<br>
