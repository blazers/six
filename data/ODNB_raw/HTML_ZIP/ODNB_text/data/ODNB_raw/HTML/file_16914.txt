<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lockyer,  Nicholas</span>  (1611&#150;1685), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was the son of William Lockyer of Glastonbury, Somerset. He matriculated from the notoriously puritan college of New Inn Hall, Oxford, on 4 November 1631 and graduated BA on 14 May 1633. Migrating to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where his BA was incorporated in 1635, he proceeded MA in 1636. In June 1654 he returned to Oxford to take his BTh.<br>
<br>Lockyer supported parliament at the outbreak of the civil wars and held the Independent position in the debate on church government. He was popular with the Commons and was occasionally asked to preach a sermon during days of fasting; an example of his preaching can be found in his sermon of 28 October 1646, where he spoke on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 53: 10. The text, Lockyer said, was a divine promise of &#145;deliverance from all sorts of slavery and bondage&#146;  (Lockyer, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached</span>). He counselled that patience and obedience to God's word was the key to parliamentarian success. In particular he opposed a quick settlement for the sake of an ungodly peace.<br>
<br>In 1649, after the execution of Charles I and the establishment of the republic, Lockyer was rewarded by Oliver Cromwell, who appointed him as one of his chaplains. He was also made a fellow of Eton College and the preacher at Windsor Castle. In 1650 he was presented to the living of Farnham Royal in Buckinghamshire. Lockyer's position as one of Cromwell's chaplains earned him political favour, and in January 1651 the council of state sent him to Scotland as a preacher to the parliamentary commissioners. He was perhaps not the most politic of choices; he caused great offence when he preached a sermon at Edinburgh in favour of congregationalism. This he published in 1652 as <span class="italic">A Little Stone out of the Mountain</span>. The Scottish presbyterians were not content to let this insult go without notice and James Wood, a professor of theology at St Andrews, replied in 1654 alleging Lockyer's ideas to be &#145;counterfeit&#146;. Despite this foray into controversy the majority of Lockyer's works were uncontentious, being works of puritan pietism aimed at the &#145;conversion of souls&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.102).<br>
<br>Lockyer became one of the preachers at Whitehall during the sitting of Barebone's Parliament in 1653, and in 1655 he was chosen as one of the commissioners for the approbation of public preachers. His honours were fully realized in February 1659 when he replaced Francis Rous as provost of Eton College. He was also the preacher at the London parishes of St Benet Sherehog and St Pancras, Soper Lane.<br>
<br>Lockyer benefited financially from his association with Cromwell, having appropriated dean and chapter lands settled upon him and his heirs by the council of state. He chose to take the monetary value of the lands at ten years purchase instead of the land itself and used the &pound;2100 that he acquired from the council to purchase the manors of Hambleton and Blackwell in Worcestershire. Although the protectorate council sought to reconvey the manors back to the state, Lockyer managed to keep the property. He also acquired Irish lands in Munster and corresponded with Henry Cromwell on their administration.<br>
<br>As an ardent Cromwellian and Independent, Lockyer refused to conform to the royalist and Anglican Restoration and was expelled as provost of Eton in August 1660 to be replaced by General George Monck's brother, Nicholas. He took up the mantle of nonconformity and in September 1666 fled to Rotterdam to escape prosecution under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. He had returned to England by 1669 and preached at a meeting at Bell Lane in Spitalfields. In 1670 he was again forced to flee to the Netherlands, for publishing <span class="italic">Some Seasonable and Serious Queries upon the Late Act Against Conventicles</span>, a pro-toleration tract that argued that the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> was against God's word, the constitution, and the principles of prudence and policy. Lockyer was not distracted by the threat of persecution, however, and the nonconformist minister Oliver Heywood heard him preach in St Michael Street, London, in January 1683. Despite his resolve, Lockyer's health began to fail at this time and he moved to Woodford in Essex, where he died on 13 March 1685. He was buried at St Mary, Whitechapel, Stepney. The name of his wife is unknown, but they had six children: a son, Cornelius, and five daughters, Aholiabah, Rebecca, Hannah, Elizabeth, and Abigail.<br>
