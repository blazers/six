<span class="headword">Harpur,  Charles</span>  (1813&#150;1868), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 23 January 1813 at Windsor, New South Wales, the third of seven children of Joseph Harpur (<i>d</i>. 1842) of Kinsale, co. Cork, and Sarah Chidley (<i>d</i>. 1866) of Somerset. Both parents were former convicts, Joseph having arrived on the <i>Royal Admiral</i> on 22 November 1800, and Sarah on the <i>Alexander</i> in August 1806. Joseph Harpur made good in the colony, becoming parish clerk and schoolmaster at Windsor, and retiring on a government pension of &pound;50. Charles Harpur gave his date of birth as 1817, possibly because his parents were not married until 16 June 1814, and possibly from a wish to emulate the youthfulness of Chatterton, the subject of the long poem <span class="italic">Genius Lost</span>. As he explained in a note to &#145;To the Lyre of Australia&#146;, Harpur decided in his teens to be a poet, making a choice that brought him &#145;hunger and rags&#146;. He allied himself with the native-born in the colony, the &#145;native youth&#146; or the &#145;currency lads&#146; as they called themselves, and styled himself &#145;Charles Harpur, an Australian&#146;. He was sympathetic to the plight of the Aborigines, and used Aboriginal terms in his writing.<br>
<br>Poems by Harpur appeared in the Sydney newspapers from 1833 onward, and <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Donohoe</span>, a blank verse play on the bushranger of that name, was published in selections in <span class="italic">The Monitor</span> in 1835. Harpur found employment in Sydney as a post office clerk in 1836, but resigned to avoid dismissal on 10 October 1839. Although he continued to spend time in Sydney, where his mother had remained in Parramatta after his father's death in 1842, Harpur for the next twenty years lived a life of hardship on the Hunter River, where his elder brother Joseph had established a farm. He was located at Patrick's Plains and then at Jerry's Plains, where he deputized for his brother in the post office store, and acted as pound-keeper and as agent for the Sydney papers. At Jerry's Plains in 1843 Harpur met Mary Ann Doyle (1820&#150;1899), who was in part the inspiration of the sonnet series to &#145;Rosa&#146; (later &#145;Nora&#146;). She was the daughter of a more prosperous family in the district, who frowned on the match, but the pair eventually married on 2 July 1850. After unsuccessful ventures as a schoolmaster at Black Creek and at Muswellbrook, Harpur returned to sheep farming at Doyle's Creek, probably with the assistance of his wife's family.<br>
<br>In the 1840s and 1850s Harpur had increasing contact with the nascent literary circles in Sydney, especially with Henry Halloran, D. H. Deniehy, and N. D. Stenhouse. He was praised by Henry Parkes, who in 1843 made him a gift of the six-volume edition of Shelley. These years on the Hunter were Harpur's most productive, not only for some of his identifiably &#145;Australian&#146; poems, but also for polemical pieces in verse and prose on such issues as convict transportation, land reform, and self-government.<br>
<br>Harpur's feeling that the world owed him a living was answered in August 1859, when he was appointed gold commissioner for the Goulburn and Araluen districts. He proved effective in this office, and selected land and built a house (the &#145;Euroma&#146; of the later poems) for his family at Eurobodalla. This property was hardly adequate to support him when the goldfields appointment lapsed in July 1866, and ruinous floods came the year after. Harpur died on 10 June 1868 of &#145;induration (hardening) of the lungs&#146;. He was buried at Euroma, beside his second son Charlie, killed in a shooting accident in 1867.<br>
<br>Apart from the occasional pamphlet offprinted from a poem appearing in the press such as <span class="italic">The Tower of the Dream</span> (1865), Harpur's published volumes were two: <span class="italic">Thoughts: a Series of Sonnets</span> (1845) with a dedication to Wordsworth, and <span class="italic">The Bushrangers</span> (1853), a reworking of <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Donohoe</span>, with &#145;other poems&#146;. As the posthumous <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1883) were substantially abridged and &#145;improved&#146; by H. M. Martin, there was no comprehensive text of Harpur until the 1984 edition by Elizabeth Perkins, who is preparing a definitive text. Harpur's manuscripts occupy some twenty-five volumes in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, offering multiple versions of the poems, annotations sometimes as extensive as the text, and much writing in prose.<br>
<br>Harpur has been seen as the poet who brought Australian landscape into Australian verse. It was already there, in W. C. Wentworth's <span class="italic">Australasia</span> (1823) and Charles Tompson's <span class="italic">Wild Notes, from the Lyre of a Native Minstrel</span> (1826), but these were in the cultivated eighteenth-century manner, which seemed to later readers to mask the features of the Australian scene. Harpur was more recognizably a Romantic, and &#145;A Mid-Summer Noon in the Australian Forest&#146; was gratefully seized on by the anthologists. This misrepresented his work. Although particular observations were not lacking (the &#145;rush of startled kangaroo&#146;, &#145;the upland growths of wattles&#146;), Harpur more often saw the Australian bush as vast and overwhelming and unknown&#151;to some extent recording an Australia which has passed. He typically responds to the natural world in its larger, sometimes more threatening movements, as in a bushfire, a storm in the mountains, or in the darkness enveloping those who are lost in the bush. This is the quality of &#145;The Creek of the Four Graves&#146;, &#145;The Kangaroo Hunt&#146;, and &#145;Lost in the Bush&#146;. Harpur is also sensitive to the distinctive effects of light, especially in glare and haze, and he made an antipodean analysis of the &#145;dancing&#146; of the sun.<br>
<br>Like Wentworth and Tompson before him, and his admirer Henry Kendall after, Harpur saw himself as laying claim to the English poetic tradition, and as giving it individual expression. The projected edition of his poems in 1867 was dedicated &#145;to the People of England&#146;. From the autobiographical &#145;The Dream by the Fountain&#146; to the more ambitious &#145;The World and the Soul&#146; and &#145;The Witch of Hebron&#146;, his work is informed by his conviction of the peculiar sensibility and mission of the poet. He becomes his own hero, meeting adversity with a melancholy satisfaction. Harpur's achievement otherwise is to have conveyed the immensity and the menace of the Australian bush more effectively in larger poetic structures, where the local faults may be overtaken in the general impression.<br>
