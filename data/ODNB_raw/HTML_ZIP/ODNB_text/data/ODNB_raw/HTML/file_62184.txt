<span class="headword">Stockenstrom, Sir  Andries</span>, first baronet  (1792&#150;1864), <span class="occ">colonial official and politician</span>, was born in Cape Town on 6 July 1792, the son of Andries Stockenstrom, (1757&#150;1811), a Swedish-born Cape official of the Dutch East India Company and his colonial-born wife, Maria Geertruyda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Broeders (<i>bap</i>. 1764). Like many so-called Cape Dutch families, the Broeders' founding maternal ancestor was actually a seventeenth-century Guinean slave. From 1795, when the British took over Cape Colony, Stockenstrom's father served the new administration. Stockenstrom spent six years at a Cape Town secondary school, Tot Nut van't Algemeen (<i>c</i>.1802&#150;1808), an institution which was a product of the Dutch enlightenment but in its colonial manifestation probably contributed to Stockenstrom's sense of African identity. In 1811 his father was killed while leading a colonial militia, and the young Stockenstrom took over his post as commander of the burgher forces. He served in the Cape corps (1811&#150;15), was landdrost (magistrate) of Graaf Reinet (1815&#150;25), commissioner-general for the eastern Cape (1828 and 1833), member of the advisory council (1827 and 1833), lieutenant-governor of the eastern Cape (1836&#150;9), commander of the burgher militia (1847), and member of the Cape parliament (1854&#150;7). On 8 December 1828 he married Elsabe Helena (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of Gysberg Henry Maasdorp, a woman renowned for possessing &#145;the strongest Christian principles&#146;: they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Required to play a leading role in Cape society from a young age, Stockenstrom soon developed a paternalistic relationship with frontier Afrikaners and creolized Khoisan (Hottentot) and slave populations. His strong sense of duty was constantly frustrated by his belief that the British administrators he served were the inexperienced, ill-informed, and corrupt beneficiaries of nepotism. He valued British constitutional and legal systems but believed that &#145;Anglo-saxon&#146; &#145;colonialism&#146; was motivated by greed and characterized by hypocrisy. Were &#145;plunder&#146; and &#145;extermination&#146; deemed profitable, he argued, then metropolitan evangelicals would claim these as &#145;the work of a beneficent providence&#146;. Dutch colonialism, guilty, he acknowledged, of similar &#145;aggressions&#146;, never justified itself &#145;by the pretence of spreading the <span class="roman">Bible</span> or civilization&#146;. His public career and personality were marked by these convictions  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 124&#150;5).<br>
<br>When Dutch rule ended, Khoisan gatherer-hunters and pastoralists had either been incorporated into the colony, or had withdrawn beyond its boundaries, but colonists had achieved little more than ineffectual stalemate with the more powerful Xhosa-speaking farmers beyond the eastern frontier. The introduction of the British army and, after 1820, British settlers, led to increasingly bitter wars as the newcomers combined superior fire power and numbers with an unprecedented ruthlessness. The Xhosa were increasingly &#145;cleared&#146; from their essential grazing lands and were driven to ever-expanding retaliation and resistance. Frontier violence was further exacerbated by a &#145;reprisal&#146; system permitting burgher patrols to invade Xhosa territory in search of allegedly stolen cattle. At the first Xhosa homestead such patrols encountered, stock would be seized regardless of whether there was local evidence of involvement in rustling. Stockenstrom opposed the reprisal system, recommending that the Cape cease to act as if it had authority over African lands beyond the colony's boundaries. His &#145;treaty system&#146; proposed recognizing the sovereignty of chiefdoms, and sought to maintain the peace by diplomacy. Proof of cattle theft would require acceptance by both sides and restoration of stolen animals would need the active involvement of colonial officials and the Xhosa polity.<br>
<br>After Stockenstrom's evidence to the 1835 House of Commons select committee on Aborigines, his policy proposals led the colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg, to appoint him lieutenant-governor of the eastern Cape. Returning in the aftermath of the devastating 1835 war with instructions to revoke the annexation of Xhosa territory recently designated as Queen Adelaide Land, he became increasingly unpopular among new and old settlers. His key role in drafting ordinance 50, the <span class="roman">Hottentot Emancipation Act</span> of 1828, and his opposition to the reprisal system brought enemies, not only among influential Grahamstown British settlers and their press but also among British administrators and the British officer corps. Their efforts to undermine his system ensured that it was eventually deemed a failure. Stockenstrom's own sense of failure in these years derived from his inability to dissuade the land-hungry Afrikaners of the eastern Cape from abandoning the colony in the emigration afterwards known as the great trek. At this point Glenelg lost office, and Stockenstrom his protector, and the new colonial secretary acceded to his enemies and dismissed him. In 1840, for the first time in his life, and to the delight of his enemies, Stockenstrom, though made first baronet on 29 April, was no longer a public servant.<br>
<br>In 1846, war broke out between the Xhosa and the colony, the remaining, mostly prosperous, Afrikaners refused to serve in the militia under British officers, judging these to have provoked the Xhosa and to be dangerously ignorant of bush warfare. Without Afrikaner support, however, the defeat of the Xhosa promised to be much more difficult and expensive. Reluctantly, Stockenstrom was persuaded by the governor to lead the burgher forces, the only way of ensuring colonial volunteers. Suffering great physical hardship but succeeding militarily, Stockenstrom then made efforts to restore the peace by allowing the vanquished Xhosa to maintain their independence. His proposals were, however, overturned by a new governor, Sir Harry Smith, who, intent upon dealing the Xhosa a crushing defeat, annexed their territory and renamed it British Kaffraria. Stockenstrom corresponded with the colonial secretary, Earl Grey, demanding a comprehensive inquiry into frontier policy and warning that Smith's actions would precipitate a greater crisis. Grey's refusal proved the turning point in Stockenstrom's career. He now threw his energies into a campaign for self-government. Having long opposed the granting of representative institutions to the colony, he finally conceded that the existing system prevented the reform of frontier policy. At much the same time an agitation for representative government had emerged among Cape Town's editors and its middle classes who resented the control over patronage and economic policy which the governor and his nominated legislative council held. This agitation was given extra impetus in the widespread protests against the colonial secretary's attempts to settle convicts at the Cape.<br>
<br>Since Stockenstrom's frontier policy was widely supported by Cape Town's leaders it was possible for a coalition to emerge between those who wished to limit the expansion of the colony, because it promised endless external warfare and internal rebellion, and those who saw that such expansion required the presence of a strong&#151;inevitably imperial&#151;state. Such a state, they recognized, would place severe limits on an accountable property-holding system of government. Stockenstrom therefore found himself in an alliance with Cape Town's English and Dutch-Afrikaner merchants, its professional men, and its white and coloured artisans and petty traders. In the western Cape their campaign won the support of small-town traders and Dutch-Afrikaner wine and wheat farmers. In the east Stockenstrom leadership won the backing of similar groups&#151;those who were the beneficiaries of colonial stability and opposed to the expansionism of the Grahamstown party&#151;Afrikaner wool farmers, graziers, and their dependants. Moreover, because groups of eastern Khoisan peoples crossed over to the Xhosa in the war of 1851, Stockenstrom and others made strenuous efforts to win the loyalty of western Khoisan and former slaves by promising them access to a property franchise in any future Cape parliament.<br>
<br>Only those dependent on government patronage, or with an interest in territorial expansion and land speculation, or those who profited from the commissariat trade and illegal gun trafficking, opposed Stockenstrom and his allies in their campaigns. Facing a complete breakdown of consent, the colonial administration conceded an elected constitution-drafting committee and Stockenstrom was returned with by far the largest number of votes polled. The poll gave him much satisfaction, but ultimately he and the other &#145;popular&#146; members were again outflanked. Representative rather than responsible government was granted, and, in the face of further expansion of the colony's boundaries, Stockenstrom resigned and retired to Europe. He died of bronchitis in London on 15 March 1864 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. A portrait was left to the South African Library in Cape Town. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Gysbert Henry (1841&#150;1912), army officer and member of the legislative council of Cape Colony. The baronetcy became extinct in 1957.<br>
