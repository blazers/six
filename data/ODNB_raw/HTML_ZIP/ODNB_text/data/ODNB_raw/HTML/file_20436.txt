<span class="headword">Oates,  Francis <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1840&#150;1875), <span class="occ">traveller and naturalist</span>, the second of three sons of Edward Oates of Meanwoodside, near Leeds, Yorkshire, and Susan, daughter of Edward Grace of Burley, in the same county, was born at Meanwoodside on 6 April 1840. Always known as Frank, he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 9 February 1861, but took no degree, owing to bad health. For some years from 1864 he was an invalid. In 1871 he travelled in North and Central America, where he made a collection of birds and insects. On his return in 1872 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. On 5 March 1873, accompanied by his brother W. E. Oates, he sailed from Southampton for Natal hoping to make a journey to the Zambezi, and, if possible, to some of the unexplored country to the north to study the geography and zoology. He left Pietermaritzburg on 16 May 1873 and spent some time in the Matabele (Ndebele) country north of the Limpopo River. Three attempts to proceed were frustrated by the weather and the opposition of the local people. Finally, starting on 3 November 1874, he arrived on the banks of the Zambezi on 31 December, and made large collections of specimens of natural history. He was one of the first outsiders to see the Victoria Falls in full flood; but no entries are found in his journal after his arrival there. The unhealthy season came on, and Oates contracted a fever. After an illness of twelve days, he died when near the Makalaka kraal, about 80 miles north of the Tati River, on 5 February 1875, and was buried the following morning. Dr. A Bradshaw, who happened to be in the neighbourhood, attended him, and saw to the safety of his collections. Oates's journals were edited and published by his brother Charles George Oates in 1881, under the title of <span class="italic">Matabele Land and the Victoria Falls</span>. A second, enlarged, edition (1889) has appendices by experts on the natural history collections which proved of more value than the text itself.<br>
