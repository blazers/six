<span class="headword">Pyne,  James Baker</span>  (1800&#150;1870), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 5 December 1800 in Bristol. Following his parents' wishes he entered a solicitor's office but, at the age of twenty-one, abandoned the law and took up painting, which he reputedly taught himself. In 1824 he first exhibited in Bristol and is said to have undertaken picture restoration as well as to have taught. In 1827 W. J. M&uuml;ller was apprenticed to Pyne. In 1828 Pyne is first recorded as a drawing-master, living at 6 Dove Street, Kingsdown, Bristol; a year later he briefly shared a studio with Samuel Jackson, a fellow landscape painter. However, he enjoyed little of the social life of Bristol's other artists, though their influence upon him was profound [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95531', "Bristol school of artists")</script>]. The idyllic <span class="italic">Imaginary Scene</span> (1828, Anglesey Abbey), for instance, is an original response to Francis Danby's poetic landscapes, and <span class="italic">View of the Avon from Durdham Down</span> of 1829 (City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery) reflects the intensity of observation of Danby's Bristol scenes.<br>
<br>Pyne probably moved to London in 1835, and in 1837 his <span class="italic">Clifton, Near Bristol, from the Avon</span> (City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery) was shown at the Royal Academy. It was considered &#145;disagreeably white&#146; by a reviewer in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> for September of that year  (p. 341), who wondered &#145;in what sick fit&#146;  (ibid.) it had been painted; such comments as these reflect Pyne's increasingly restricted and light-toned palette which was influenced by J. M. W. Turner, of whose more conventional works Pyne was a rare and sympathetic follower. Pyne exhibited regularly at the British Institution from 1833 until 1844 and almost annually at the Royal Academy from 1836 to 1841, but thereafter his loyalty was to the Society of British Artists, whose vice-president he became. In 1846 he travelled through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. He returned to Italy in 1851, travelling with the watercolourist William Evans of Bristol (1805&#150;1858) for three years.<br>
<br>Between 1838 and 1840 Pyne published <span class="italic">Windsor and its Surrounding Scenery</span>, a volume of lithographs. With the patronage of the picture dealer William Agnew there followed <span class="italic">The English Lake District</span> in 1853 and <span class="italic">The Lake Scenery of England</span> in 1859. Pyne occasionally collaborated with other artists, including T. S. Cooper and William Shayer who painted the foreground figures and animals in his pictures. From 1840 to 1868 he numbered his paintings and kept related notebooks recording their details. These two volumes are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, where there is also a small but representative collection of his later oils and watercolours. Pyne died on 29 July 1870 at his home, 203 Camden Road, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. His sons James Baker Pyne, a photographer, and Charles Pyne, an artist, survived him. His studio sale was at Christies on 25 February 1871.<br>
