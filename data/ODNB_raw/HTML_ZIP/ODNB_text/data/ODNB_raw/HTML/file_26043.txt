<span class="headword">Soulemont,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1500, <em>d.</em> 1541), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born in Jersey, the eldest son of the jurat Pierre de Soulemont of St Helier and his wife, Marguerite Messervy. As early as the fourteenth century his family lived in the island parishes of St Helier and Grouville. As a young man Soulemont left the Channel Islands for England; little is known of his education, although Anthony Wood (who confuses him with the cleric and controversialist Thomas Solme) claims that Soulemont studied for a time at Oxford. Despite settling in England, Soulemont retained close ties with his native island. Rector of Grouville from 1533, he was named dean of Jersey by the bishop of Coutances the following year and, although non-resident, he vigorously defended his decanal jurisdiction against encroachment by the states of Jersey.<br>
<br>By late 1532 Soulemont had entered royal service as one of the king's French secretaries, when he was needed at Calais to prepare for meetings with Fran&ccedil;ois I. He was one of the senior clerks employed by Thomas Cromwell, whom he served as chief secretary from 1537. Soulemont's fluency in French naturally involved him in a variety of extra duties, in addition to drafting and translating routine diplomatic correspondence. Such special assignments included examining witnesses to assaults upon members of the French ambassador's household, and investigating complaints from French merchants trading in England. In April 1539 he met with the French ambassador to discuss foreign policy developments, in place of his master Cromwell, who was ill. That same year he served as deputy clerk of parliaments, in which position he sought to rationalize and simplify the records. On 21 September 1540 he was appointed clerk of parliaments, and his journal describes the closing of the 1540 parliament in exceptional detail.<br>
<br>Both Cromwell and the king rewarded their secretary's energetic labours. In April 1537 Soulemont was collated to the prebend of Knaresborough at York, while in July of the same year Cromwell persuaded the bishop of Hereford to collate his clerk to the vacant prebend of Moreton Magna. Having already acquired the Cornish manors of Forwood and Fowey from his friend and colleague Thomas Wriothesley in early 1538, Soulemont subsequently secured from the crown leases of the site of Canonsleigh convent, Devon, as well as property at the London Greyfriars.<br>
<br>In addition to his administrative work Soulemont was a keen antiquary, collecting and transcribing records (from the royal library and elsewhere) relating to the history of Jersey and the Channel Islands, on which he was an authority. He supplied manuscripts to John Leland, who praised Soulemont's scholarship in his <span class="italic">Encomia</span>, while John Bale mentioned two unpublished works by Soulemont (now lost): the &#145;Select antiquities of Great Britain&#146;, and a life of Thomas Becket. Thomas Soulemont died, probably in London, on 12 July 1541 and was buried at the Carmelite convent in the city.<br>
