<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Joyce,  William Brooke</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lord Haw-Haw]</span>  (1906&#150;1946), <span class="occ">fascist and propaganda broadcaster</span>, was born on 24 April 1906 at 1377 Herkimer Street, Brooklyn, New York, USA, the first of three sons of Michael Francis Joyce (1869/70&#150;1941), builder and contractor, originally of co. Mayo, Ireland, but naturalized as an American citizen in 1894, and his wife, Gertrude Emily Brooke (<i>d</i>. 1944), of Shaw, Lancashire. The family returned to Ireland in 1909, where Joyce was educated in Roman Catholic schools, including the Jesuit St Ignatius Loyola College. The Joyces were, however, ardent loyalists, and Joyce later claimed to have fought as a boy alongside the Black and Tans.<br>
<br>In December 1921 the family moved to England, where Joyce enlisted, first, in the British army (from which he was discharged when found to be under age), and then the London University Officers' Training Corps (when, to facilitate his application, his father falsely claimed that the family were British citizens). He studied at Battersea Polytechnic (1922&#150;3), then at Birkbeck College, University of London, where he graduated with a first-class honours degree in English in June 1927. On 30 April 1927 he married Hazel Katherine Barr at Chelsea register office. They had two daughters, but the marriage was dissolved in 1937.<br>
<br>While at Birkbeck, and still in his teens, Joyce became heavily involved in extreme right-wing politics. From 1923 to 1925 he was a member of the British Fascisti (and first came to the notice of special branch), and during an affray between fascists and communists at Lambeth during the general election of 1924 received the razor slash that permanently marked his face: the scar extended from his right ear to the corner of his mouth. Although he joined the Conservative Party in 1928, Joyce joined Sir Oswald Mosley's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96364', "British Union of Fascists (BUF)")</script> in 1933, and became area administrator for the home counties, then director of propaganda and Mosley's deputy leader, with a reputation as a ferocious orator. In 1934 he obtained a British passport, after falsely declaring his birthplace to be Galway, Ireland. He married Margaret Cairns White (1911&#150;1972), another active BUF member, at Kensington register office on 13 February 1937. However, Joyce and Mosley fell out (Joyce considered Mosley insufficiently antisemitic), and shortly after standing as a BUF candidate in Shoreditch in the London county council elections of March 1937 (when he received fourteen per cent of the vote) Joyce set up his own party, the National Socialist League (NSL), which called for Britain to unite with Hitler's Germany against the &#145;twin Jewish manifestations&#146; of Bolshevism and international finance. Margaret Joyce became the NSL's assistant treasurer. Fearing certain detention should war come, the Joyces travelled on 26 August 1939 to Berlin, and on 18 September Joyce began broadcasting in the Reichsrundfunk's English-language service, initially as a newsreader. Within a few years he had become Germany's principal English-language broadcaster.<br>
<br>The original Lord Haw-Haw (a name coined by Jonah Barrington of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in September 1939) was almost certainly one Wolff Mittler, the Reichsrundfunk's chief English-language broadcaster in the early part of the war, though the name was also applied to several other broadcasters, including Norman Baillie Stewart. Although Joyce's accent (&#145;some sort of hybrid between a Yankee twang and an Irish brogue&#146;, according to J. W. Hall  (Hall, 1)) differed markedly from Mittler's stilted aristocratic manner, his distinctive sardonic tones and call-sign (&#145;Jairmany calling&#146;) made him the most instantly recognizable of German propagandists to Britain and the nickname stuck to him. By May 1940 he was using it himself on air and his true identity had been revealed in the British press. His broadcasts from Zeesen, Bremen, and especially Hamburg rapidly made him a celebrity of sorts in Britain, inspiring, for instance, a popular song (&#145;Lord Haw-Haw, the Humbug of Hamburg&#146;) and a musical revue starring Max Miller, and they concerned the British government sufficiently to commission a BBC listener research report in December 1939. It found that two-thirds of the British public listened to Joyce at least occasionally&#151;although apparently more out of curiosity than defeatism. Although listening appeared to decline from mid-1940, public fascination with the broadcasts continued, and apocryphal &#145;Haw-Haw rumours&#146; (for instance, that Joyce had correctly predicted local air raids, or demonstrated a sinisterly precise knowledge of town clocks) persisted throughout the war. Despite little evidence that these broadcasts did undermine British morale as intended, Goebbels himself rated Joyce's wartime propaganda contribution highly. In June 1942 Joyce was promoted to chief commentator in the English-language service, with his own programme, <span class="italic">Views on the News</span>. In September 1944 he was awarded Nazi Germany's war merit cross first class.<br>
<br>While in Germany Joyce also published a propaganda tract, <span class="italic">Twilight over England</span> (1940), wrote extensively for the &#145;black&#146; propaganda stations the New British Broadcasting Station and the Workers' Challenge Station, and was active in recruiting other broadcasters from among British prisoners of war. Margaret Joyce also worked for German English-language radio, writing women's features and from November 1940 to May 1942 broadcasting (as &#145;Lady Haw-Haw&#146;) weekly talks aimed at British women. After being granted German nationality in September 1940, the two were divorced in August 1941 (he citing adultery, she cruelty), but they remarried at the Berlin-Charlottenburg register office on 11 February 1942.<br>
<br>Joyce's final broadcast was from Hamburg on 30 April 1945. He and his wife went into hiding near the Danish border, but he was shot and arrested on 28 May 1945 after a British soldier recognized his voice. Although Joyce had never legitimately held British nationality, he was tried on three counts of treason at the central criminal court, London, on 17&#150;19 September 1945, with the prosecution (led by Sir William Hartley Shawcross) arguing that his youthful claims of British citizenship and, above all, his fraudulent holding of a British passport from 1933 to 1940 were sufficient proof in law that he had placed himself &#145;under the protection of the British crown&#146; and thus owed the crown allegiance in return. After direction to this effect from the trial judge, Mr Justice Tucker, and with Joyce refusing to give evidence, the jury took just twenty-three minutes to convict him of the third count, that he had &#145;adhered to the King's enemies&#146; by broadcasting for them between 18 September 1939 and 2 July 1940 (the date his British passport expired). Despite some disquiet in legal and other circles, appeals to the High Court and the House of Lords were dismissed (the latter with one dissentient), and Joyce was executed by hanging on 3 January 1946 at Wandsworth prison, London, one of only three people to be convicted by a British court of treason after the war and of only two to be executed (the other being John Amery). Margaret Joyce was detained in military custody for some months but was not prosecuted, and later moved to Ireland. She died in 1972.<br>
