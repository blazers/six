<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Charles</span>  (1775&#150;1839), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Birmingham, on 12 February 1775, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16820/', "Charles Lloyd (1748&#150;1828)")</script>, the Quaker banker and philanthropist, and his wife, Mary Farmer (1751?&#150;1821). He was educated privately, and was intended to have entered his father's bank, but he found this unpalatable, as he did the medical studies he briefly attempted at Edinburgh. His first published volume of poems appeared in Carlisle in 1795, and in the following year he met Coleridge when the latter visited Birmingham to enlist subscribers to his newspaper, <span class="italic">The Watchman</span>. He was so attracted by Coleridge's conversation that he offered to pay him &pound;80 a year, in return for staying with him and having the benefit of his conversation. They lived together in Kingsdown, Bristol, and Lloyd came to know others in radical and literary circles in that city, including Robert Southey and Joseph Cottle. At the close of 1796 Lloyd accompanied Coleridge and his wife to Nether Stowey. Coleridge's sonnet &#145;To a Friend&#146;, on the birth of his son Hartley, and his lines &#145;To a Young Man of Fortune&#146;, are probably addressed to Lloyd. The latter had already printed at Bristol, for publication in London, a volume of elegiac verse to the memory of his grandmother Priscilla Farmer, with an introductory sonnet by Coleridge, and concluded by &#145;The Grandam&#146; of Charles Lamb, to whom Lloyd had been introduced by Coleridge. Almost immediately after his arrival at Nether Stowey, Lloyd was attacked by fits, the precursors of his subsequent depressive illness. He remained with the Coleridges until the summer of 1797, and in the autumn of that year all the poems which he wanted to preserve were added by Cottle, along with poems by Charles Lamb, to a second edition of Coleridge's poems. But Coleridge did not think well of this publication, and ridiculed its contents in sonnets signed Nehemiah Higginbottom in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> (November 1797).<br>
<br>In the turbulent political climate prevailing in the aftermath of the French Revolution, Lloyd's association with a notable radical like Coleridge made him the object of attacks by conservative publicists&#151;understandably, when one of the blank-verse poems that he published with Lamb in 1798 celebrated<blockquote>
<div>the promis'd time &hellip; when equal man<br>
</div>
<div>Shall deem the world his temple<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Blank Verse</span>, 1798, 12&#150;13)</blockquote>He and Lamb figure in Gillray's famous cartoon illustrating Canning's satire on revolutionary sympathizers, <span class="italic">The New Morality</span>, appearing there as a toad and a frog. Lloyd was anxious to rid himself of this reputation, and defended his respectability in a <span class="italic">Letter to the Anti-Jacobin Reviewers</span>. He reinforced this, in 1799, with some <span class="italic">Lines Suggested by the Fast &hellip; February 27th 1799</span>, where he censured the modern &#145;spirit of insubordination&#146;, and helpfully included in a footnote a quotation from a similar satire by Lamb. Partly with the same purpose, and with Southey's encouragement, he had published in the previous year an epistolary novel, <span class="italic">Edmund Oliver</span>, a polemic against William Godwin's radical views on marriage, and on the rule of reason over the passions. Although poor as a novel, it gives some insight into contemporary moral and political controversies. It also draws on Coleridge's experiences as a private soldier in a way that Coleridge felt was a betrayal of confidence. This, and Lloyd's resentment at the Higginbottom sonnets, led to an estrangement.<br>
<br>In 1798 Lloyd was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and made the acquaintance of Thomas Manning, who was giving private tuition in mathematics. On 24 April 1799 he married Sophia Pemberton. They lived for a time at Barnwell, near Cambridge, but in late November 1800 moved into Old Brathay, a house near Ambleside, where they saw much of the Wordsworths, Southey, and (later) Thomas De Quincey. At first he appeared enviably happy, with no financial anxieties thanks to his wealthy father, and a growing number of children (eventually five sons and four daughters). Sophia herself, De Quincey maintained, was &#145;as a wife and mother unsurpassed by anybody I have known in either of those characters&#146;  (De Quincey, 259). But from 1811 Lloyd began to suffer from distressing auditory illusions, and a serious illness occurred in July 1813.<br>
<br>For some years Lloyd was engaged in translating Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, and in 1815 published a translation of Alfieri's plays, a project which De Quincey suggests he undertook to divert his mind from the threat of the onset of insanity. He also wrote, and printed privately at Ulverston, a novel, entitled <span class="italic">Isabel</span>, which was published in 1820; it has remained almost unknown. Meanwhile he was removed to the Quaker psychiatric hospital in York. If De Quincey is to be believed, he was not well treated there, and he escaped some time in 1818, and found his way back to De Quincey's cottage in Grasmere.<br>
<br>Lloyd now entered on a period of relative health. He himself attributed this to the healing effect of a performance by W. C. Macready in a stage adaptation of Scott's <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>, which moved him in a way that recalls the emotional release described by John Stuart Mill in his account of recovery from depression. He became quite productive, publishing a collection of his poems under the title of <span class="italic">Nugae canorae</span> (1819); <span class="italic">Desultory Thoughts in London</span> (1821); <span class="italic">Poetical Essays on the Character of Pope</span> (1821); <span class="italic">The Duke d'Ormond</span> (1822), a tragedy published with <span class="italic">Beritola</span>, a metrical tale; and a small volume of poems (1823). But from this time he was silent, and evidently his disabling depression returned. He eventually went to France, and died in a <i>maison de sant&eacute;</i> at Chaillot, near Versailles, on 16 January 1839. His wife had predeceased him on 7 August 1830.<br>
<br>Although Lloyd's life touched several of the older generation of English Romantic writers, his own work is mainly of historical interest. Lamb thought his poetry obscure (&#145;not to be understood reading on one leg&#146;) but &#145;<i>sinuous</i>, and to be won with wrestling&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Lamb</span>, 2.402, autumn 1823). As for De Quincey, whose account of Lloyd in <span class="italic">Recollections of the Lake Poets</span> is the fullest contemporary assessment that we have, he declared that Lloyd was &#145;amongst the most interesting men I have known&#146;  (p. 258). But this is hardly apparent from Lloyd's published writings.<br>
