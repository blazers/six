<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carmichael,  Thomas David Gibson</span>, Baron Carmichael  (1859&#150;1926), <span class="occ">administrator in India and art collector</span>, was born at Castlecraig, near Edinburgh, on 18 March 1859, the eldest son of the Revd Sir William Henry Gibson Carmichael, tenth baronet (1827&#150;1891), and his wife, Eleanora Anne (<i>d</i>. 1861), eldest daughter of David Anderson, of St Germains, East Lothian. He was educated at the Revd Cowley Powles's school, Wixenford, in Wokingham, where the local rector, Charles Kingsley, inspired in him a passion for natural history. In 1877 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA with second-class honours in history in 1881, his first choice of natural science having been vetoed by his father. A visit to Italy in 1881&#150;2 sparked a lifelong interest in Italian art and art collecting.<br>
<br>After university Carmichael turned his attention to politics. His father, however, in spite of a family tradition of whiggism and the entreaties of Lord Rosebery, forbade him from standing for parliament and in 1885 he accepted instead the post of private secretary to Lord Dalhousie, secretary of state for Scotland, and afterwards to his successor, Sir George Trevelyan.<br>
<br>On 1 July 1886 Carmichael married Mary Helen Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1947), eldest of the seven children of Albert Llewellyn Nugent, younger brother of the second Baron Nugent. They settled at Chiefswood, former residence of Sir Walter Scott, near Melrose, where Carmichael began experiments in commercial apiarism. In 1891 he founded the Scottish Bee-Keepers' Association.<br>
<br>In 1891 Carmichael was appointed to the Prison Commission and from 1894 until 1897 chaired the general board of lunacy for Scotland. In December 1891 he succeeded to the baronetcy and with his wife moved to the family estate at Castlecraig. With his father now dead, he stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals in a by-election for Peebles and Selkirk in 1892, and was eventually returned for Midlothian in succession to W. E. Gladstone in 1895, in which year he also became a freemason. He subsequently held the office of grand master in Scotland, Victoria, and Bengal. In 1900 financial difficulties caused him to retire from parliament and later to sell his house and art collection. He continued, however, as chairman of the Scottish Liberal Association (1892&#150;1903), whose anti-imperial tone during the South African War of 1899&#150;1902 he was unable to prevent. He was a councillor of the Liberal League. In 1904 he was appointed by parliament to the Scottish churches commission. In 1908 he had just settled in as the first chairman of the newly constituted board of trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland when he was offered the governorship of Victoria, Australia.<br>
<br>In December 1908, four months into his term in Victoria, Carmichael was embroiled in a constitutional controversy. The sitting Conservative ministry was defeated in a vote of no confidence and, rather than call on either of the leaders of the minority parties to form a government, Carmichael dissolved the state parliament and called for fresh elections, a decision which generated considerable unpopularity in the local press and boosted the agitation for local men to be appointed as governors. The rest of his term in Victoria was less eventful, although the Carmichaels found the social routine expected of an Australian governor and his wife exhausting&#151;all the more so as Carmichael took seriously his obligation to visit outlying parts of the state. He calculated that during his time in Victoria he delivered an average of two speeches a day; his wife, patroness of numerous associations for children's and women's welfare, did not lag far behind.<br>
<br>In May 1911 Carmichael was appointed governor of Madras. He took office in the following November, but five months later, in April 1912, was appointed the first governor of the newly reconstituted state of Bengal.<br>
<br>Bengal was a difficult office. To the upheaval of the territorial readjustment and removal of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi were added a wartime economy and local revolutionary movement. Carmichael's administration achieved some progress in matters of public hygiene and education, but he preferred to leave the larger issues to others. Underlying some of his diffidence was a recognition that, as foreigners, Britons could never provide a government wholly acceptable to Indians. He left India in mid-1917 at the expiry of his five-year term.<br>
<br>Back in Britain Carmichael immersed himself in the art world again. He had previously served as a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery (1904&#150;8) and of the National Gallery (1906&#150;8). Now, in 1918, he became a trustee of the Wallace Collection, in which capacity he served until his death in 1926, and also again of the National Gallery (1923&#150;6). The sales in 1902 and 1926 of his collections, which observed few limits in class, school, or period, were events in the art world. His numerous public gifts included a bequest of a <span class="italic">Virgin and Child</span> by Piero di Lorenzo to the National Gallery.<br>
<br>Carmichael had a shrewd understanding of people and a whimsical sense of humour, and appears to have been happier as an observer of humankind than as a leader or administrator. He was created KCMG in 1908, GCIE in 1911, and GCSI in 1917, and appointed lord lieutenant of Peeblesshire in 1921. In February 1912 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Carmichael of Skirling. He died at his home, 13 Portman Street, Oxford Street, London, on 16 January 1926, after four years of failing health. He was buried in Skirling churchyard. He was survived by his wife, who in 1929 published an affectionate memoir, <span class="italic">Lord Carmichael of Skirling</span>. They had no children (although they had brought up two of Carmichael's nieces and a nephew) and the peerage became extinct on Carmichael's death. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his cousin, Henry Thomas Gibson-Craig (-Carmichael).<br>
