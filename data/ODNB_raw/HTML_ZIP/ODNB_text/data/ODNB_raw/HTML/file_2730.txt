<span class="headword">Boaden,  James</span>  (1762&#150;1839), <span class="occ">biographer and playwright</span>, was born on 23 May 1762 in Whitehaven, Cumberland, the only son of William Boaden (1735?&#150;1790) and his wife, Elizabeth. His father (originally from Penryn, Cornwall), a merchant in the Russian trade, took the family to London, where Boaden was educated for a mercantile career. But after a period in a counting-house he turned to journalism, and in 1789 was installed editor of <span class="italic">The Oracle</span>, a newly founded literary newspaper. On 12 June 1793 he was admitted as a student of the Middle Temple. Though he remained in membership for almost thirty-three years, until early 1826, he was not called to the bar.<br>
<br>Boaden's first dramatic work, the musical romance <span class="italic">Ozmyn and Daraxa</span> (songs published 1793), earned him &pound;100. More significant are the melodramas <span class="italic">Fontainville Forest</span> (1794, described in the prologue as being &#145;[c]aught from the Gothic treasures of Romance&#146;, and acted fifteen times in 1794&#150;5) and <span class="italic">The Italian Monk</span> (1797)&#151;both adapted from Mrs Radcliffe&#151;and <span class="italic">Aurelio and Miranda</span> (1798; published 1799), based on Lewis's <span class="italic">The Monk</span>. In <span class="italic">Cambro-Britons</span> (1798), set in the time of Llewelyn and Edward I, Boaden gothicizes Celtic myth, drawing partly on Gray's ode <span class="italic">The Bard</span>. His last plays, <span class="italic">The Voice of Nature</span> (adapted from Caigniez) and <span class="italic">The Maid of Bristol</span> (both 1803), are in more sentimental vein. His one poem, <span class="italic">A Rainy Day</span> (1801), celebrates in blank verse the &#145;salubrity&#146; of Brighton's air and its &#145;very excellent&#146; theatrical company and library.<br>
<br>Boaden published nothing after 1803 for twenty-one years. Of independent means, he none the less acted as an army agent during 1805 (possibly longer) and from at least 1812 was associated with the Whitehall firm Donaldson and Boaden. Late in life, however, the catastrophic failure of his private income in 1824 projected him into a new career as theatrical biographer. In the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, Sir Walter Scott described his <span class="italic">Life of John Philip Kemble</span> (2 vols., 1825) as &#145;grave, critical, full and laudably accurate&#146;, if stylistically somewhat &#145;too Gibbonian&#146;  (Scott, 203, 241), and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (95/1, 1825, 334) praised its learning and &#145;manly &hellip; tone of feeling&#146;. His <span class="italic">Life of Mrs Siddons</span> (2 vols., 1827) (sold for &pound;100 including copyright) was preferred for its vibrancy and authoritativeness over Thomas Campbell's version (1834). His memoir of Mrs Jordan (2 vols., 1831) more accurately balanced her stage career and private life than previous attempts, and the memoir of Mrs Inchbald (2 vols., 1833), based on her letters, introduced important new material. Boaden also edited Garrick's correspondence (1831). His quasi-novels from the same period&#151;the pseudonymous <span class="italic">Man of Two Lives</span> (1828), on metempsychosis, and the moralistic <span class="italic">Doom of Giallo</span> (1835), inspired by an idea in Beckford&#151;are literary curiosities, but Boaden's biographies, founded mostly on personal acquaintance with his subjects, remain standard works, valued for their vivid detail and descriptions of acting styles and performances of the period.<br>
<br>Boaden was fascinated by literary puzzles, but his premature endorsement of <span class="italic">Vortigern</span> and the other so-called Shakespearian discoveries of William Ireland  (<span class="italic">The Oracle</span>, Feb&#150;April, 1795) was unequivocally retracted in his <span class="italic">Letter to George Steevens, Esq.</span> (1796). From this lifelong interest in Shakespeare, mainly antiquarian rather than critical, came two late essays: his discussion of the authenticity of Shakespeare's iconography (1824) and his influential theory  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1832; published in a longer version 1837), devised some twenty years previously, that identified William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, as addressee of the <span class="italic">Sonnets</span>. Since his time Boaden's contributions to the Shakespearian debate have gone largely unrecognized, but Schoenbaum  (<span class="italic">Shakespeare's Lives</span>, 1991) redresses the balance with a detailed discussion of Boaden's theories and a graceful tribute to his scholarship.<br>
<br>Repeated applications to the Royal Literary Fund from 1831 reveal Boaden's grievous financial state as new work became increasingly difficult to place. Publishers, he lamented in his last letter to the Fund (24 March 1838), seemed interested only in &#145;the writings of the whimsical &#147;Boz&#148;&#146;. Although his distinguished record ensured him assistance to a total, over eight years, of &pound;140, creditors forced him to surrender the family's residence (60 Warren Street, Fitzroy Square, London) in late 1831, and for three months during 1835 to seek refuge in the Fleet gaol. Remarkably, destitution compromised neither his scholarly integrity nor instinct as a gentleman.<br>
<br>Valued for his intellect and fund of anecdote, Boaden had a range of literary and theatrical friends. Deafness aside, he enjoyed good health almost to the end. He died of dropsy in lodgings at 36 Waterloo Bridge Road, London, on 16 February 1839, and was buried at Kensal Green with his wife, Sarah (1763/4&#150;1838), who had died as a result of dysentery on 1 August the preceding year. Of their nine children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2731/', "John Boaden")</script> was an artist and Caroline (<i>fl</i>. 1825&#150;1839) wrote at least nine plays and some short fiction for the <span class="italic">Lady's Magazine</span>.<br>
