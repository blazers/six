</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">D'&Eacute;on de Beaumont,  Charles Genevi&egrave;ve Louis Auguste Andr&eacute; Timoth&eacute;e</span>, Chevalier D'&Eacute;on in the French nobility  (1728&#150;1810), <span class="occ">diplomatist and transvestite</span>, was born at the Hotel d'Uz&egrave;s, Tonnerre, Burgundy, on 5 October 1728. He came of an old noble family, possibly of Breton origin, though, like much else about this extraordinary personage, his genealogical pretensions later gave rise to judicial proceedings. His father, Louis D'&Eacute;on de Beaumont (1695&#150;1749), was a lawyer who became mayor of Tonnerre and a sub-delegate of the intendant of the generality of Paris; he married Fran&ccedil;oise de Chavanson (<i>d</i>. 1792) in 1723, and the couple also had a daughter. Charles's grandfather Louis D'&Eacute;on (1656&#150;1720), styled &#145;&eacute;cuyer, avocat, bailli de Tanlay, St Vincent, Quincy, Molosmes, St Martin, etc&#146;, had also been the intendant's sub-delegate. Louis D'&Eacute;on had close links with the comte d'Argenson, intendant of Paris, sending him presents of game on his appointment as minister of war in 1743. The young D'&Eacute;on studied law at the Coll&egrave;ge des Quatre-Nations in Paris, obtaining several degrees. At nineteen he was already a lawyer at the <i>parlement</i>. His brilliance, as well as his family background, helped him to become secretary to Bertier de Sauvigny, intendant of Paris. He showed early signs of the prolific writer that he was to become. In 1753 he published an <span class="italic">Essay historique sur les diff&eacute;rentes situations de la France par rapport aux finances sous le r&egrave;gne de Louis XIV et sous la r&eacute;gence de M. le duc d'Orl&eacute;ans</span>, which was praised by Controller-General Machault and by the historian President H&eacute;nault. He became a friend of Malesherbes, who appointed him as a royal censor for history and literature in 1758.<h2>
<a name="Russianmissionandmilitarycareer17551763"></a>Russian mission and military career, 1755&#150;1763</h2>In a letter of 5 June 1774 to his brother-in-law, the Chevalier O'Gorman, D'&Eacute;on claimed that in 1755 he had attended a ball at Versailles disguised as a woman and, briefly revealing his masculinity, had seduced Madame de Pompadour. Having resumed his feminine role, he had then been the object of Louis XV's pressing attentions  (F. Gaillardet and H. Gaillardet, 302&#150;3). Although epicene in appearance, D'&Eacute;on was indisputably male. Moreover, his well-established court and country connections provide a more reliable explanation to the origins of his career than his alleged nocturnal and possibly transvestite activities. In 1755 he was already well known to Louis XV's cousin the prince de Conti, who was in charge of the king's private diplomatic system known as the <i>secret du roi</i>. The <i>secret</i> involved recruiting clandestine agents to work alongside unsuspecting official French diplomats, particularly in eastern Europe. That year D'&Eacute;on was probably recruited by Conti to accompany a Scots Jacobite, Alexander Peter Mackensie of Kildin, known as the Chevalier Douglas, on a secret mission to Russia aimed at establishing private lines of communication between Louis XV and the Empress Elizabeth. No written proof of D'&Eacute;on's presence on this mission, or of his having adopted female attire, has been found  (Cox, 23). Douglas's mission was a success, and the empress asked Louis XV to accredit a minister to her court. Douglas was chosen, and from 4 August 1756 he was joined by D'&Eacute;on, now definitely in male attire, as embassy secretary, a position which he retained under the subsequent French ambassador, the marquis de l'H&ocirc;pital, until 20 August 1760. When Russia adhered to the Franco-Austrian alliance against Prussia, Douglas unwittingly nullified a clause protecting France's ally Turkey from the warlike attentions of the Russians by accepting a secret agreement between the three powers to that effect. France ratified the treaty but not the secret agreement. D'&Eacute;on saved the situation, though not Douglas's position, in May 1757 by using his influence with the empress to set aside the secret agreement. D'&Eacute;on served Louis XV's clandestine intentions in 1759 when he persuaded Elizabeth and the Russian chancellor, Vorontsov, to withdraw an offer of mediation which the French foreign minister, the duc de Choiseul, had prevailed upon her to make, and to continue the war.<br>
<br>D'&Eacute;on left Russia in 1760 to follow his natural calling as a soldier, and after his arrival at Versailles in October (bringing with him the empress's adherence to the anti-British maritime convention) he was granted a pension of 2000 livres. He asked the count of Broglie, who had succeeded Conti at the head of the <i>secret</i>, whether he could serve under his orders and those of his brother, the mar&eacute;chal de Broglie, in the forthcoming campaign. Choiseul, then minister of war, agreed to this request, and on 18 May 1761 D'&Eacute;on was transferred from his first regiment, the colonel-general dragoons, to the r&eacute;giment d'Autichamp. He was present at the costly engagement of Villinghausen, where the marshal's army lost the advantage through the failure of the army under Soubise to lend it timely support. After Broglie's army crossed the Weser on 19 August 1761 D'&Eacute;on was sent with an order to a lieutenant-general, the count of Guerchy, who refused to execute it. D'&Eacute;on little knew the role Guerchy was later to play in his career, but he had become aware of the way French court factions and antagonisms had fatal repercussions on military operations. Guerchy, like Soubise, was part of the circle of Madame de Pompadour, whereas the Broglie brothers were not in favour with her. D'&Eacute;on was wounded in an engagement at Ulstrop, where a troop of cavalry passed over him, an event which may have had an effect on his mental state, though it did not prevent him from displaying courage and initiative at Einbeck and, in October, capturing a force of several hundred Prussians who had tried to sever French lines of communication at Osterwick.<br>
<br>Brilliant as it had been, D'&Eacute;on's military career was brief. After the death of the Empress Elizabeth in January 1762 the comte de Broglie asked him for a memorandum on the state of the Russian court and wanted to send him back to St Petersburg, especially after the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> which placed Catherine II on the throne on 9 July. The new minister of foreign affairs, the comte de Choiseul (later duc de Praslin), had other plans for the young dragoon, whom he had befriended in Vienna while D'&Eacute;on was recovering from a broken leg on his earlier return from Russia. Despite D'&Eacute;on's reluctance, he was appointed on 29 August 1762 secretary to the duc de Nivernais, who was sent to negotiate the peace in London. Louis XV ordered Tercier, the acolyte of Broglie in the <i>secret</i>, to pay the young man a gratuity of 1000 livres. It was a timely payment as he had already incurred considerable expenditure both in the army and in anticipation of returning to Russia. Although reckless financial extravagance was a charge to which D'&Eacute;on laid himself open over the years, it is worth noting that the French court acted on the principle that expected lavish expenditure should precede irregular and parsimonious reimbursement.<h2>
<a name="London17631764"></a>London, 1763&#150;1764</h2>In London, Nivernais was in no position to negotiate from strength, but he obtained the best terms he could for his country and was ably seconded by &#145;le petit D'&Eacute;on&#146;, who laboured assiduously on the paperwork and knew how to exploit situations and indiscretions. Much to Praslin's surprise, Nivernais even persuaded George III to allow D'&Eacute;on to take the English ratification of the treaty of Paris back to France, an unusual privilege for a foreigner. He delivered the instrument of ratification to the duke of Bedford in Paris on 26 February 1763. D'&Eacute;on was at the apogee of his career, earning the praise of Praslin and a verbal commendation from Louis XV at Versailles. Upon his return to London, Nivernais invested him, on 30 March, with the insignia of the royal and military order of St Louis. He was henceforth known as the Chevalier D'&Eacute;on. In addition he received a gratuity of 6000 livres.<br>
<br>If 1763 was D'&Eacute;on's year of personal success, it also marked the beginning of his downfall. Louis XV was understandably angered by the humiliating terms of the treaty of Paris and he sought revenge against Britain. Through the agency of the <i>secret</i> he began to gather information that would facilitate an eventual invasion of the British Isles. An officer called Carlet de la Rozi&egrave;re was sent over in June 1763 to reconnoitre the English coastline. Nivernais had left England in May at the end of his embassy. D'&Eacute;on, who had been made resident charg&eacute; d'affaires on 17 April, was promoted in July to the rank of minister-plenipotentiary until the arrival of the next ambassador. The arrangement was convenient for Louis XV, and the chevalier, who had already worked for him in Russia, was now brought fully into the <i>secret</i> by a letter of 3 June from the king. He was informed about La Rozi&egrave;re's mission and told that his secret correspondents would be Broglie and Tercier. Broglie also asked him to spy on the new ambassador, who turned out to be the insubordinate officer whom the chevalier had encountered before, the comte de Guerchy. For greater security, D'&Eacute;on was to move out of the embassy into lodgings with a cousin, D'&Eacute;on de Mouloize, who was sent over for the purpose, and with La Rozi&egrave;re. According to the chevalier, Madame de Pompadour discovered his role in the elusive chain of the <i>secret</i>. The story is plausible. Choiseul and Praslin, supported by Madame de Pompadour and Guerchy, were opposed to the influence of the Broglie brothers and actively sought to neutralize the network of the <i>secret</i>.<br>
<br>D'&Eacute;on was caught between the factions. Moreover he lived on a lavish scale in London, entertaining Horace Walpole, David Hume, and others. His pension was still only 2000 livres, and he had never been adequately reimbursed for his earlier expenditure in Russia. Yet he bought fine clothes and collected books and rare manuscripts. Creditors began to press their demands on the chevalier, who pestered Praslin for payment of his debts but without success. He also wanted to retain the title of minister-plenipotentiary after Guerchy had taken up his post. From France, Nivernais, his only friend in the Choiseul circle, warned him that his conduct was unreasonable. With Guerchy's arrival on 16 October, D'&Eacute;on became unhinged. Praslin's reply to his request about his title was offensive, though understandable, and D'&Eacute;on's rejoinder to it was insulting. He soon picked a quarrel with Guerchy. The ambassador had brought with him D'&Eacute;on's letters of recall, but at the same time the chevalier received a private note from the king implying that the signature on the letters was only a clerk's manual and not his own, thus rendering them technically invalid. On 23 October D'&Eacute;on dined with Guerchy at the latter's residence, Monmouth House, in Soho Square, and subsequently claimed that the ambassador had tried to poison and kidnap him. Louis XV yielded to Praslin's demand to have him extradited, while at the same time sending word to him to go into hiding and to take good care of his secret papers. By this stage D'&Eacute;on had moved into 38 Brewer Street, where he was armed and barricaded himself in with his cousin. Although he had complied with an order to hand over official papers to Guerchy, he had kept back those relating to the <i>secret</i>, which, as Broglie pointed out to the king, he was prepared to defend at all costs. The papers which had not already been returned to the king through La Rozi&egrave;re were now carefully hidden in the recesses of his lodgings.<br>
<br>The British government refused the request for his extradition. D'&Eacute;on was not prepared to return to France unless he had positive guarantees of freedom and safety from Praslin. In February he learned from the banker Thomas Walpole that payment of his French pension had been discontinued because of a new law suspending payment on all pensions granted after April 1759. As the king did nothing to help him, the chevalier took the outrageous step in March 1764 of publishing the correspondence between himself, Nivernais, Guerchy, Choiseul, and Praslin concerning his disputes with them. Horace Walpole wrote that the book &#145;had an immense circulation, and the attempts to suppress it at Paris, of course, served to make it more sought after&#146;  (Walpole, 3.393). The publication by J. Dixwell of the <span class="italic">Lettres, m&eacute;moires et n&eacute;gociations particuli&egrave;res du Chevalier D'&Eacute;on, ministre pl&eacute;nipotentiaire aupr&egrave;s du roi de Grande-Bretagne</span> had made the French government a laughing stock. His official pension was stopped. However, it is worth noting that D'&Eacute;on had printed no documents relating to the <i>secret</i>. He began to apply pressure on the king through Broglie, claiming that the opposition was offering him &pound;40,000 for his remaining papers. He demanded redress against Guerchy by 22 April, otherwise he would be forced to clear his name by further revelations. Louis XV took the threat calmly, but arranged for him to receive a secret pension of 12,000 livres (paid in two half-yearly instalments and backdated to 1 April 1762) in exchange for the return of compromising documents. An intermediary, de Nort, returned to France without the papers, D'&Eacute;on having indicated that he wanted a further payment of 116,341 livres to clear all his debts.<h2>
<a name="London17641777"></a>London, 1764&#150;1777</h2>Following the publication of the <span class="italic">Lettres, m&eacute;moires et n&eacute;gociations</span> Guerchy sued D'&Eacute;on for libel, and the case was heard in the court of the king's bench on 3 July 1764. D'&Eacute;on did not present himself and was found guilty by default. Sentence was postponed until he could be brought to court. He was subsequently outlawed. He had disappeared, adopting female attire as a disguise. He hid himself at Byfleet, Surrey, in the house of an opposition MP, Humphrey Cotes, a friend of John Wilkes. On 12 February 1765, on the evidence of an adventurer called Treyssac de Vergy, originally an acolyte of Guerchy but now an ally of D'&Eacute;on, the French ambassador was indicted in the court of common pleas of having incited Treyssac to kill D'&Eacute;on. The case went through several stages. Guerchy's residence was stoned by a Wilkite mob. The ambassador was recalled, and the chief cause of D'&Eacute;on's agitation was removed. Broglie, who found the chevalier's reports on the British political scene extremely useful, urged the king to make another conciliatory gesture towards a man whose personal loyalty to the monarch had not wavered. Guerchy was replaced by Durand, a member of the <i>secret</i>, as minister-plenipotentiary, and in July 1766 Durand handed over to D'&Eacute;on a handwritten letter from the king bestowing upon him the pension of 12,000 livres, to be paid &#145;wherever he may be, except in time of war amongst my enemies and until such time as I think proper to appoint him to some post, the salary of which shall exceed the amount of this pension&#146;  (Louis XV to D'&Eacute;on, 1 April 1766, Boutaric, 1.350). The chevalier handed over some papers to Durand, but the threat remained that, under the pressure of his creditors, he might reluctantly be forced to sell the rest to the earl of Chatham or to others.<br>
<br>However, D'&Eacute;on was still an outlaw, though no further proceedings had been taken against him in the English courts. In 1769 he left Brewer Street temporarily for Petty France, Westminster. The summer he spent at Staunton Harold, the seat of his friend the fifth Earl Ferrers, working on a massive treatise on public administration which was eventually published in thirteen volumes at Amsterdam in 1774 under the title of <span class="italic">Les loisirs du Chevalier d'&Eacute;on</span>. His wide circle of friends, which now included Wilkes, enabled him to keep Louis XV informed about the British political scene. In 1772, for instance, he reported the claim that Bute and Mansfield were plotting to restore the Pretender on condition that he converted to Anglicanism. A year later Broglie was seeking information from him about the identity of Junius after an Englishman, probably Thomas Mante, had been presented as the pamphleteer at Versailles. Doubts were expressed at this time about D'&Eacute;on's sex, and wagers were made, although he himself professed to be indignant at the suggestion that he was not a man. Yet, according to a document cited by the duc de Broglie  (2. 468&#150;9), D'&Eacute;on had confided to Drouet, another agent of the <i>secret</i>, that he was in reality a woman. This admission was communicated by the comte de Broglie to Louis XV in July 1772. The chevalier's situation remained desperate because his secret royal pension was paid irregularly and his debts had not been expunged. His reports were accompanied by requests for money and reminders that he still held compromising documents, which he had entrusted to Lord Ferrers and Humphrey Cotes, partly for safekeeping and partly in pawn for advances of money.<br>
<br>With Louis XV's death in May 1774 the <i>secret du roi</i> came to an end, as the new king wished to conduct diplomacy through regular channels. D'&Eacute;on was offered a deal: the return of his papers and an undertaking to remain silent on the disputes with Praslin and the now deceased Guerchy in exchange for a confirmation of his pension and a safe-conduct to return to France. D'&Eacute;on held out for a reimbursement of debts amounting to 250,000 livres, public vindication of his past conduct, and the new post he had been promised by Louis XV. The king refused these terms, and his pension was stopped. With the approach of war, however, his services were even more in demand. During October and November 1775 an agreement was reached between him and Beaumarchais, whom Vergennes, the new minister of foreign affairs, had sent over to London for the purpose. In addition to handing over his papers, D'&Eacute;on was required to adopt female attire, though he was to be allowed to continue wearing the cross of the order of St Louis. Louis XVI would treat his debts as a capital sum invested towards a lifelong annuity of 12,000 livres to be paid in lieu of his pension. There was also a recognizance by Beaumarchais that D'&Eacute;on had contracted debts of unspecified &#145;plus fortes sommes&#146; which Beaumarchais undertook to repay (F. Gaillardet and H. Gaillardet, 338; Boutaric, 2.445). The new &#145;chevali&egrave;re&#146; was also to be paid a trousseau. It is likely that the requirement about female attire was viewed at Versailles as reasonable in the light of D'&Eacute;on's earlier admission as to his sex, and also as a means of controlling an unruly individual who had often provoked his opponents to duels.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears17771810"></a>Later years, 1777&#150;1810</h2>Sensing rightly that the slippery Beaumarchais would not honour all the financial agreements, D'&Eacute;on kept back some papers (of which, it now appears, he had made copies). The payment of the &#145;plus fortes sommes&#146; gave rise to bitter disputes between the two. In August 1777 he returned to France. Upon presenting himself at Versailles in military uniform, he was promptly ordered to resume female dress. The chevalier found himself ill at ease in female garb, despite the services of Marie Antoinette's modiste, Mlle Bertin. His requests to be allowed to don his uniform and to serve in the war were turned down, and he was refused permission to return to London in 1778 to look after his financial interests after the death of Lord Ferrers. D'&Eacute;on settled on his family estates at Tonnerre. After a few months imprisonment at Dijon in 1779 for wearing his uniform in public, he again took up residence at Versailles before being finally allowed to return to England in November 1785. His unpaid landlord in Brewer Street was threatening to sell his library and collections. D'&Eacute;on was also pursuing the successive heirs of Lord Ferrers for &pound;5000 which the earl had received from Beaumarchais on his behalf. He resumed his social life, dining frequently with Wilkes and his daughter; he stayed with the duke of Dorset at Knole and saw Lord Chancellor Loughborough (who had been his lawyer in 1763). James Boswell met &#145;Madame D'&Eacute;on&#146; on 5 March 1786 and was shocked by her appearance: &#145;she appeared to me a man in woman's clothes, like Hecate on the stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Experiment</span>, 48). The <i>chevali&egrave;re</i> took to fencing as a source of revenue. On 9 April 1787 he appeared in an &#145;assault of arms&#146; with Saint-Georges at Carlton House in the presence of the prince of Wales, his female dress adding panache to his dexterity.<br>
<br>The collapse of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> freed D'&Eacute;on from any bonds of loyalty to a system which had treated him badly, but it also had disastrous consequences for him. He may have celebrated the 14 July in 1790 but he also found that his annuity fell into arrears and was later stopped. He twice offered his military services to his country without success. He had to sell his collection of books and manuscripts (including those of Vauban) in 1791. A public subscription in the City of London provided him with &pound;475, but by 1792 he had to sell his jewellery and plate. Several of his relatives were guillotined. After the deaths of his mother and sister, the estates at Tonnerre were confiscated, although he was not technically an &eacute;migr&eacute;.<br>
<br>In partnership with Mrs Bateman, an actress and female fencer, D'&Eacute;on gave displays of his skill at the Haymarket Theatre and at Ranelagh in 1793. Though sixty-five years old, the <i>chevali&egrave;re</i> fenced &#145;as though in the vigour of youth&#146;  (Cox, 132). At Southampton on 26 August 1796 he was seriously wounded in the armpit during an assault of arms and was thereafter unable to fence. He had left his lodgings in Brewer Street in 1793 and was then living with Mrs Mary Cole, a native of Lorraine and the widow of a Royal Navy pump-maker, at 26 New Milman Street. She kept house for him for fourteen years believing him to be a woman. He spent five months in prison for debt in 1804. That year he signed a contract with Messrs Richardson for the publication of his memoirs, which were to be written by Thomas William Plummer. The work was never completed, though the material was assembled for it. He finally had to sell his cross of St Louis. D'&Eacute;on died peacefully on 21 May 1810 at 26 New Milman Street. A medical examination carried out by several doctors, including the surgeon Thomas Copeland, in the presence of Sir Sidney Smith and others, found that his male organs were &#145;in every respect perfectly formed&#146;  (F. Gaillardet and H. Gaillardet, 406). Mrs Cole &#145;did not recover from the shock for many hours&#146;  (Cox, 135). According to his wishes, D'&Eacute;on was buried, on 28 May, in the graveyard of St Pancras Old Church with, between his hands, a crucifix and a copy of the <span class="italic">Imitation of Christ</span>, &#145;which I have so badly imitated&#146;  (ibid., 136). His grave disappeared when the Midland Railway destroyed the churchyard. He had made a will but had not signed it, and administration of the estate was entrusted to Plummer. His belongings, including Richard Mead's collection of editions of Horace's works, were sold by Christies on 19 February 1813. Plummer retained many papers of D'&Eacute;on, including some relating to his role in the <i>secret du roi</i>, which were unfortunately dispersed in 1966.<br>
<br>The Chevalier D'&Eacute;on's outrageous, though understandable, behaviour in 1763&#150;4 and his extraordinary career as a transvestite have overshadowed his remarkable prowess as a soldier, his undoubted skills as a diplomat, informant, and secret agent, and his qualities as a scholar and writer.<br>
