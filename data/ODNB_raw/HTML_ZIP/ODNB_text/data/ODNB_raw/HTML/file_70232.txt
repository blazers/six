</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hunt, Sir  David Wathen Stather</span>  (1913&#150;1998), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 25 September 1913 at Rose Acre, Shincliffe, co. Durham, the son of the Revd Bernard Patteson Wathen Stather Hunt, curate of St Nicholas's, Durham, and his wife, Elizabeth Graham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Milner. Stather was added to his and his father's names after his birth. His education began at home: with typical precocity he was able by the age of three to read and write. His formal education was at St Laurence College, Ramsgate, and at Wadham College, Oxford, where he took firsts in both moderations (1934) and Greats (1936).<br>
<br>Hunt was destined for the home civil service. But, with war on the horizon, he decided it would be more amusing to spend the interim in an Oxford senior commonroom than in the corridors of power. He took up a suggestion of Maurice Bowra and in 1937 (having obtained a diploma in classical archaeology) tried successfully for Magdalen College, where he remained a don until 1947. His deep love of Greece dated to those years before the war when his archaeological pursuits twice took him on visits there. It was appropriate therefore that he should have been transferred from the Welch regiment in 1940 to serve as an intelligence officer in Greece. He remained in intelligence for the rest of the Second World War&#151;in the Middle East, north Africa, and Italy, for much of the time on the staff of Field Marshal Alexander. His war service was chronicled in his most considerable book, <span class="italic">A Don at War</span> (1966). The book was remarkable for its scrupulous military history, Hunt's deep loyalty to Viscount Alexander, and his occasional flashes of impish humour over, for example, his war injury, sustained when the ball from a lavatory cistern fell on his head. He finished the war with the rank of colonel, three mentions in dispatches, OBE, and the American bronze star. He spent a further year in the army helping Lord Alexander (now governor-general of Canada) to complete his official war dispatches.<br>
<br>The year 1947 marked a turning point in Hunt's career. His second volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">On the Spot</span>, published in 1975, reveals his conclusion that he could not return to Oxford and his taste for the service of the crown. The option of staying in the army was rejected in favour of the Dominions Office (shortly to be renamed the Commonwealth Relations Office) and Hunt joined as a principal. In 1948 he was posted to South Africa as first secretary. On 29 May the same year he married Pamela Muriel Medawar (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), daughter of Nami Medawar. They had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1950 Hunt became foreign affairs private secretary to the prime minister, first Clement Attlee and, after the 1951 general election, Winston Churchill. His autobiography shows his affection and admiration for Attlee and his more distant though admiring relationship with Churchill. He became an assistant secretary in the Commonwealth Relations Office in 1952. Following a posting to Pakistan as deputy high commissioner in 1954, he returned to the Commonwealth Relations Office as head of the Central African department in 1956, and in 1959 was promoted assistant under-secretary of state, with responsibility for Africa. In that capacity he accompanied Harold Macmillan on his &#145;wind of change&#146; tour of southern Africa in 1960. He was one of several officials who worked on the draft of Macmillan's speech, originally written by John Johnston, deputy high commissioner in South Africa. Between 1960 and 1962 Hunt served in Nigeria as deputy high commissioner under Viscount Head.<br>
<br>Hunt then embarked on three major Commonwealth missions in a period of tumultuous transition. In 1962, as the first high commissioner in Kampala, he was involved in the suppression of a mutiny by the Ugandan army. He was knighted KCMG in 1963, having been made CMG in 1959. In 1965, as high commissioner in Cyprus, his knowledge of the Greek language and history enabled him to establish so firm a rapport with Archbishop Makarios as to achieve an element of stability in Anglo-Cypriot relations despite a situation of near civil war. After virtual civil war in Cyprus, he encountered on his return to Nigeria as high commissioner in 1967 the real thing. In the face of fierce parliamentary and press criticism he put his job on the line to convince Harold Wilson that Britain must not support rebellion against the established government of General Gowan. Meanwhile, Hunt's first marriage was dissolved in 1967, and he was granted custody of his two sons. In Nigeria he married in 1968 his second wife, Iro Myrianthousis. Together they established a tradition of superb hospitality. This was to serve them well during Hunt's last and only foreign posting, as ambassador to Brazil in 1969. Together with his mastery of Portuguese and his relish for travel in that vast country, it ensured that their mission there was remembered as a notably successful one. Hunt retired from the diplomatic service in 1973.<br>
<br>Hunt's life in retirement might have been more tranquil but it was certainly full. As well as chairman of the board of governors of the Commonwealth Institute (1974&#150;84) he was Montague Burton visiting professor of international relations at Edinburgh (1980), a director of Observer Newspapers (from 1982), and a consultant. His wife's Greek connections rekindled his interests in Greek culture and he was president of the Classical Association (1981&#150;2) and of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies (1986&#150;90). His last book, published in 1989, was a biography, edited with Iro Hunt, of Caterina Cornaro, the last queen of Cyprus.<br>
<br>Hunt acquired national celebrity as BBC Television's Mastermind in 1977 (answering questions on the Roman revolution as well as general knowledge questions) and then as Mastermind of Masterminds in 1982 (with Alexander the Great as his special subject). Success as Mastermind, he said, could be put down to reading and keeping your nerve. Certainly he read voraciously and his career showed no lack of nerve. But there was more to Hunt than that. He had a marvellously alert mind, a lively interest in everything, a prodigious memory, and instant recall. This ensured an impressive mastery of languages and a capacity to complete the <span class="italic">Times</span> crossword in about nine minutes, to identify a few bars of music and fine claret with accuracy, and ensure no misquotation passed him by. He loved life and lived it to the full.<br>
<br>Hunt died at the Princess Royal Hospital, Haywards Heath, Sussex, on 30 July 1998, having lived in Lindfield, Sussex, throughout his retirement. He was survived by his wife, Iro, and the two sons from his first marriage. A memorial service was held at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 12 November 1998.<br>
