<span class="headword">Blore,  Edward</span>  (1787&#150;1879), <span class="occ">antiquarian artist and architect</span>, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2681/', "Thomas Blore (1764&#150;1818)")</script>, antiquary and topographer, and his first wife (his cousin), Margaret Blore (1761&#150;1791), was born in All Saints' parish, Derby, on 13 September 1787 and baptized on 30 September at All Saints' Church, Derby. According to C. L. Eastlake, he was apprenticed to an engraver, but an acquaintance stated that &#145;He was brought up to no profession except that of an Artist&#146;  (Hunter, BL, Add. MS 36527, fol. 36<i>v</i>). As a youth he lived at Bakewell, Derbyshire, with his father and his second wife and subsequently at Stamford with his father, whom he assisted by drawing architectural illustrations for his <span class="italic">History of Rutland</span> (1811). &#145;In point of accuracy&#146;, his youthful sketches of church monuments, carefully outlined and shaded in Indian ink, &#145;have been compared to photographs&#146;  (Eastlake, 138). He then helped to illustrate James Hall's <span class="italic">Essay on the Origin, History and Principles of Gothic Architecture</span> (1813). To Hunter at this period Blore &#145;appeared very prepossessing. There was a delicacy of frame, and a kind of trembling delicacy of spirit which interested agreeably&#146;, which he retained in later life  (Hunter, BL, Add. MS 36527, fol. 36<i>v</i>).<h2>
<a name="Theantiquarianartist"></a>The antiquarian artist</h2>In London before 1807 Blore had made the acquaintance of the future architect Thomas Rickman. Their correspondence from 1813 to 1822 shows that by the end of 1813 Blore was &#145;again in London&#146;, and some months later he was engaged by the topographer John Britton to illustrate his work on Peterborough Cathedral, followed by similar commissions for Durham and Winchester (published in 1817). As his father sank into lunacy (although he did not die until 1818), Edward Blore, his sole support, was &#145;driven by sheer necessity&#146;  (Hunter, BL, Add. MS 36527, fol. 36<i>v</i>) to draw such architectural illustrations for authors and booksellers, and also made detail drawings for architects. He contributed to R. Surtees's <span class="italic">Durham</span>, G. Baker's <span class="italic">Northamptonshire</span>, and R. Clutterbuck's <span class="italic">Hertfordshire</span>. But he told Hunter, whom he charged &pound;367 for work on <span class="italic">Hallamshire</span>, that his profession was not a profitable one. Britton paid him partly in books for his twenty-six drawings of Winchester and seventeen of York, charged at 7 guineas each in 1816&#150;17. His drawings of Althorp for T. F. Dibdin's <span class="italic">Aedes Althorpianae</span> (1822) brought him the acquaintance of the Spencer family, which was to prove of great value: the second Earl Spencer employed him to draw and restore the family tombs in Great Brington church; his younger son George (&#145;Father Ignatius&#146;) told Blore in 1835 that &#145;I considered that you were my original friend&#146; in matters of church architecture, and that &#145;many circumstances of ancient and happy recollection bind us together&#146;  (George Spencer to Edward Blore, 3 March 1835, CUL, Add. MS 8170). Lady Spencer, who showed his drawings among her friends, told the bishop of London in 1826 that Blore was &#145;a Man of deep learning, &amp; of accurate information, as an Antiquarian, on all subjects related to Gothick Architecture, &amp; joins to these essential &amp; rare qualifications the most exquisite taste, &amp; the most correct adherence to his estimates&#146;  (Howley MS 40, fol. 153). It was the Spencers' urging that secured him the restoration of Lambeth Palace; and Sir Francis Chantrey mentioned their high regard in recommending him for Weston, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Liberated by his father's death, in 1819 Blore married Sarah Ann 
    (or Anne; 1799?&#150;1862)
  , daughter of the Revd W. Hodges, vicar of Mattersey, Northamptonshire; they had five daughters and three sons. In 1820 Blore was established in 56 Welbeck Street, St Marylebone. Already, however, he was seeking to stretch his wings. His first known architectural designs were in November 1816, for enlarging Abbotsford, Sir Walter Scott's farmhouse. A London actor, Daniel Terry (a former pupil of the architect Samuel Wyatt), recommended Blore to Scott, who found him &#145;a very fine young man, modest, simple, and unaffected in his manners, as well as a most capital artist&#146;. He provided &#145;a very handsome elevation&#146; for the new rooms  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 4.289). Scott found plans from William Atkinson superior, but for a time he preferred Blore's elevations as &#145;less Gothic &amp; more in the old fashioned Scotch stile&#146;  (ibid., 333&#150;40). Though supplanted, Blore remained in the Abbotsford circle. Scott subsequently recommended him to friends in the Scottish borders, and he managed the publication of Scott's <span class="italic">The Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland</span> (2 vols., 1819&#150;26), for which he also furnished the architectural drawings. Blore's diversification into supplying and fitting steam boilers was a short-lived enterprise of 1819, though in 1828 he designed Chantrey's bronze foundry and superintended its execution.<h2>
<a name="Earlyarchitecturalcommissions"></a>Early architectural commissions</h2>By 1824 Blore's architectural career was taking off: the Scottish judge George Cranstoun, a close friend of Sir Walter Scott, commissioned designs for a house at Corehouse, Lanarkshire, which became a model for small mansions in Tudor style; Lord Spencer wanted a new parsonage and cottages at Great Brington, Northamptonshire; at Canford, Dorset, the Hon. W. Ponsonby sought plans for a new house; while minor commissions brought in the odd 10 guineas. The following year Lord Ruthven (whose wife was another friend of Scott) wanted designs for Freeland House, Perthshire. Nevertheless, Blore, elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1823, was still substantially engaged in the preparation of antiquarian drawings, including those for his own publication <span class="italic">Monumental remains of noble and eminent persons comprising the sepulchral antiquities of Great Britain</span>; this comprised fine engravings of medieval tombs and brasses with text by the Revd Philip Bliss, for which the publisher had demanded better and &#145;much more laborious&#146; drawings than originally intended  (Blore to Bliss, 23 March 1825, BL, Add. MS 34569). When the work finally appeared in 1826, it was not a success. Blore, however, was now busy with drawings for Canford (1826&#150;36), for Sir George Philips's Weston, Warwickshire (1826&#150;30; dem. 1932), and for improvements to the choir of Peterborough Cathedral (1828&#150;32). Furthermore, inspired by Rickman's success, he sought work under the church building commission: he secured the appointment for St George's, Battersea (1827&#150;8), and soon afterwards for churches at Plaistow, Essex, and Warrington, Lancashire. Thereafter, church work remained an important element in his practice, though country houses predominated.<br>
<br>One of the most notable of these, and one of only three designs Blore ever exhibited at the Royal Academy, was Goodrich Court, Herefordshire (1828&#150;31), for Dr Samuel Rush Meyricke. Goodrich Court has evoked contrary opinions: unconvincing or stylistically authentic. Its authenticity, partly copied from Goodrich Castle, just across the River Wye, was diminished by adaptation for modern life. It had a dual function: at once country house and museum for displaying medieval armour. Its rooms were of different styles, mostly drawn from Blore's precise knowledge of period examples. The banqueting hall with arch-braced roof was one of the first revivals of this feature. Unexpected continental features, such as the conical spire, are attributable to Meyricke's German tour (1823); Blore himself did not visit the continent until the 1840s and 1850s.<br>
<br>Archbishop Howley's commission in 1829 to rebuild Lambeth Palace, the principal seat of the archbishops of Canterbury (1829&#150;38; &pound;58,000), marked Blore's arrival as a leading architect. It was in reference to Lambeth that Lady Gower designated Blore &#145;the cheap architect&#146;  (Leconfield and Gore, 156), a recommendation rather than a sneer, earned by Blore's uncommon facility for keeping within his estimates. This required a highly efficient office, with tight on-site controls through his clerk of works and frequent personal visits, and scrupulous record-keeping, as well as very careful preparation of designs and working drawings. Whenever possible, Blore preferred gross contracts (often with Locke and Nesham) to expensive daywork.<h2>
<a name="Thesuccessfulcountryhousearchitect"></a>The successful country house architect</h2>Such efficiency, coupled with his old friendship with Lord Spencer's son Lord Althorp, then chancellor of the exchequer, secured Blore in 1831 the conspicuous appointment to complete Buckingham Palace (1831&#150;8) after the dismissal of John Nash. About that time Blore moved to a &#145;handsome&#146; house, 62 Welbeck Street, where an old employer, the Revd Joseph Hunter dined with him, the Revd Philip Bliss, the neurologist Sir Charles Bell, and their wives. &#145;The furnishing of the house had something of the superb about it&#146;, he noted  (Hunter, BL, Add. MS 36527, fol. 37). Blore could well support such a lifestyle. In the 1830s his services were greatly sought after. Most of his clients were drawn from the parliamentary gentry or the peerage: whigs and tories in approximately equal numbers. He now had commissions for work at Norman Court, Hampshire (C. B. Wall, 1829); the Bishop's Palace, St Asaph (enlargement, 1830&#150;31); Keele Hall, Staffordshire (stables and projected alterations to house for Ralph Sneyd, 1830&#150;33); and a new house for the seventh marquess of Lothian at Mounteviot (<i>c</i>.1830; abandoned for lack of money after the office wing was built). There were subsequent commissions for country seats at Latimer, Hertfordshire (1832&#150;7), for Lord Cavendish; Merton Hall, Norfolk (1832&#150;5); Crom Castle, co. Fermanagh (1832&#150;8), for Lord Erne at a cost of &pound;26,600; Isleworth House, Middlesex (1833&#150;4), for W. H. Cooper; and Orford Court, Shoreham, Kent (1833&#150;9; dem. <i>c</i>.1955), for H. St J. Mildmay. Major work&#151;new or rebuilding, remodelling, or enlargement&#151;followed at Pull Court, Worcestershire (1834&#150;9), for the Revd E. Dowdeswell; Crewe Hall, Cheshire (1837&#150;43), for Lord Crewe, at a cost of &pound;30,000; Capesthorne, Cheshire (1837&#150;9), for Edward Davies Davenport, at a cost of &pound;20,000; Ballydrain, co. Antrim (1837&#150;8), for H. Montgomery; Ramsey Abbey (1838&#150;40), for Edward Fellowes; the dramatically sited Merevale, Warwickshire (1838&#150;44), for Sir W. Dugdale at a cost of &pound;35,000; and Haveringland, Norfolk (1839&#150;43; dem. 1946), for Edward Fellowes. The following decade rounded off his career with substantial works or new houses at Shadwell, Norfolk (<i>c</i>.1840&#150;43) for Sir R. J. Buxton, bt; Worsley, Lancashire (1840&#150;45; dem. 1945&#150;6), for Lord F. Egerton, later earl of Ellesmere; Great Moreton, Cheshire (1841&#150;6), for G. H. Ackers, a businessman, an unusual client (sometimes regarded as his best work, its great hall has a hammerbeam roof); Hatchford, Surrey (1842&#150;3; dem.), for Lord F. Egerton; Castle Hill, Devon (1842&#150;5), for Lord Fortescue; Crakaig, Sutherland (1845), for the duke of Sutherland; Kingston, Nottinghamshire (1843&#150;5), for Lord Belper; Thicket Priory, Yorkshire (1844&#150;7), for the Revd J. Dunnington-Jefferson; North Mimms, Hertfordshire (1845&#150;6), for Fulke Greville; and The Frythe, Welwyn, Hertfordshire (1845&#150;6), for William Wilshere. In all, Blore was responsible for major works at some thirty-eight houses.<br>
<br>All this activity demanded constant travel. Blore made, for instance, eight visits to Crom Castle in the 1830s, each of about eight days; in 1839&#150;43 Worsley received sixty-one visits. In 1838 alone he inspected works at fifteen houses. Cranstoun of Corehouse feared in 1835 &#145;that the extent of your engagements and the splendour of your reputation in the South&#146; would have precluded his again working in Scotland  (Cranstoun to Blore, CUL, Add. MS 8170, fol. 23); and his designs were in requisition in places as far distant as the Crimea and Sydney, New South Wales, where the governor's house (1837&#150;45) was erected to his somewhat <i>retardataire</i> plans. The palace erected (1830?&#150;40) at Alupka in the Crimea for Prince Vorontsov is one of the most original of Blore's buildings, and superbly exploits its rocky site. The principal block had a Jacobean entrance front and an &#145;Asiatic&#146; or &#145;Saracenic&#146; garden front: his client had prescribed one front in &#145;Oldentime&#146; architecture that would recall his early connections with England, and for the other a style appropriate to the locality.<br>
<br>Blore was also employed by HM office of works to restore Hampton Court Palace, Middlesex, in 1838&#150;48, to improve the royal apartments at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, in 1841&#150;7, and to reconstruct the Military Knights' lodgings in the Lower Ward in 1840&#150;47; also to complete Buckingham Palace by building an east front to provide private accommodation for the royal family in 1847&#150;50, a much criticized and troubled work. On its completion he is said to have been offered, and to have refused, a knighthood. He also designed a half-timbered marine villa for the royal family at Osborne, Isle of Wight, but Prince Albert preferred his own Italianate scheme.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticalwork"></a>Ecclesiastical work</h2>Blore's later ecclesiastical work included restorations or alterations at Ripon Minster (1829&#150;31) and at Norwich (<i>c</i>.1840), Ely (1840&#150;41 and 1844), and Glasgow (from 1846) cathedrals; the chapels of Wadham (1831&#150;2), Merton (1838&#150;43), and St John's (1843) colleges, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge (1831&#150;2); Thorney (1840&#150;41) and Ramsey (1843) abbeys; and several parish churches. He designed the new churches (many in a Norman revival style) at Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire (1831&#150;2); Leytonstone, Essex (1832&#150;3); Croft, Lancashire (1832&#150;3); Stratford, Essex (1833&#150;4); Potters Bar (1835); Vincent Square, Westminster (1836&#150;7; dem. 1923); St Peter's, Stepney (1837&#150;8); Christ Church, Chelsea (1838), and Christ Church, Hoxton (1839; bombed 1944)&#151;dismissed by <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> as &#145;truly contemptible&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, 13, 1842, 99); St Luke's, Soho (1838&#150;9; dem. 1936); Lambeth, London (1838&#150;9; bombed <i>c</i>.1941); Barkingside, Essex (1839&#150;40); Latimer, Buckinghamshire (1841&#150;2); St James the Great, Bethnal Green (1841&#150;4; converted to flats <i>c</i>.1990); St Thomas's, Charterhouse Gardens, London (1841&#150;2; dem. 1909); Windsor, Berkshire (1842&#150;4; altered 1875); Bushley, Worcestershire (1842&#150;3); and Cinderford, Gloucestershire (1843&#150;4). Blore restored or designed stone altar screens at Peterborough Cathedral (<i>c</i>.1830; dem. <i>c</i>.1890), Ottery St Mary, Devon (<i>c</i>.1832), Bath Abbey (1835; dem. <i>c</i>.1860); began the restoration of the spire of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford (1848&#150;50); and designed fonts and covers for the Savoy Chapel, London (1865), and St Thomas's, Worcester (1867). He also designed a number of monuments. As surveyor to Westminster Abbey (&pound;10 p.a.), from 1827 to 1849, Blore rescued the thirteenth-century retable, installed a screen between nave and choir, remodelled the choir to provide more seating and designed new stalls (1843&#150;8), and restored the cloister and the exterior of the north side of the nave (1849), though the Camdenian organ <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> condemned him as &#145;entirely unacquainted with the true spirit of Pointed Architecture; &hellip; manifestly unfit for the charge of any works in Westminster Abbey&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>, 3, 1844, 99). Eastlake, however, thought that his Westminster restorations &#145;though wanting in life and vigour, abound in careful detail&#146;  (Eastlake, 141).<br>
<br>Among secular public buildings Blore won the competition for new school buildings (1829) for the Harpur trust at Bedford (and used a similar design at Tavistock grammar school, for the duke of Bedford in 1837), but was unsuccessful in those for the houses of parliament (1835&#150;6) and the Reform Club (by invitation, 1836). His first designs for the Pitt Press at Cambridge were chosen from a limited competition (1829), and a revised, Late Perpendicular design built in 1831&#150;2 at a cost of &pound;10,700. For the Oxford University Press Blore had already built a new wing in 1829. His large Romanesque residential teacher training college at Chelsea for the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church (1840) included a free-standing chapel and an octagonal training school (1843). Extensive works for the new public school at Marlborough, Wiltshire, from 1844, included a large Decorated chapel (dem. 1884). He also designed a market house for the duke of Bedford at Woburn, and a public library in Perpendicular at Greenock (1835&#150;7, 1846).<h2>
<a name="Architecturalcharacter"></a>Architectural character</h2>Blore benefited from the increasing wealth and new living requirements of the aristocracy and gentry. His &#145;Old English&#146; style, presented in delusively attractive drawings, implied length of ancestry, though its precise ingredients might range from late Gothic to Jacobean. Although Blore, together with W. Burn and A. Salvin, was a forerunner in reviving &#145;Jacobethan&#146; styles, he failed to exploit the Elizabethan E and H plan; instead, his main house formed a rectangular block. Symmetry governed the principal fronts, though Blore, a child of the Picturesque, added interest by exploiting the device of approximate symmetry that became a Victorian architectural clich&eacute;, varying slightly elements on either side of the central axis. The lesser ranges are often built in a rougher stone or an older style, implying an aggregative history for the house, as at Merevale. His house, offices, and stables are frequently organized on a diagonal axis as at the Elizabethan Burghley House, Northamptonshire, but more loosely than would have been acceptable before the 1820s. While he placed the more noisome buildings&#151;stables, brewhouse, washhouse&#151;farthest from the main house, Blore did not develop the intensely organized hierarchy of service quarters that earned Burn his rosette. None the less, the result was, as Lord Erne, writing of Crom Castle, remarked, &#145;as comfortable a House as possible and admired by all Visitors for its compactness as well as the Handsome and convenient Arrangement of Rooms &amp;c&#146;  (Erne to Blore, CUL, Add. MS 8170, fol. 43).<br>
<br>In silhouette Blore's houses display greater irregularity than the typical Late Georgian &#145;Oldentime&#146; mansion, rising from a low stable block to higher offices to a yet higher main block overtopped by a tower, and crowned by chimney-stacks and spiky ornamental chimneys. Blore's vocabulary (often anticipated by Burn) included bays, usually canted, of two storeys, their windows mullioned and transomed; gables, frequently shaped rather than simple; a principal tower, turreted in the style of Burghley (very familiar from his life at Stamford), and a lesser tower (which might have a ventilating function), often octagonal, terminating in an ogee dome; emphatic external chimney-stacks (anticipating Pugin), rising from the ground or corbelled out at a higher level; with a balustrade at roof level; and for enrichment, strapwork, of which Blore was an early proponent. He designed Tudor or Elizabethan exteriors throughout his career, but at Pull Court (1834) he extended his repertory, with Jacobean (hitherto used only internally), perhaps inspired by his acquaintance with Keele. Thereafter he remodelled Jacobean Crewe Hall (1837&#150;8) and subsequently designed similar Hatfield-inspired Jacobean fronts at Merevale (1838) and Capesthorne (1839). Like any competent Late Georgian architect, Blore also designed in the classical style, notably at stuccoed Isleworth (1832) and Grecian Haveringland, Norfolk (1839&#150;43), and at Buckingham Palace.<br>
<br>Blore employed such modern refinements as gas lighting in the corridors (Worsley), steam heating, water-closets, and large panes of glass; and he used up-to-date techniques: iron girders to span wide spaces, copper casements in his windows, smooth and uniform machine-cut ashlar for facing, superbly constructed but leaving little freedom to the craftsman&#151;thereby contributing to the habitual smoothness and thin, papery quality for which he has principally been criticized, though most of his clients evidently liked this. One who did not was Ralph Sneyd of Keele Hall, who after years of consideration rejected Blore's &#145;slightness and poverty of detail&#146;  (Sneyd MSS, University of Keele, S/RWV/RS, 300) in favour of Salvin's more massive style, more authentic proportions, and greater feeling for materials.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandfamily"></a>Retirement and family</h2>Blore received an Oxford DCL degree in 1834. A founder of the British Archaeological Association, he supported his friend Albert Way in the controversy of 1845 which led to the formation of the Royal Archaeological Institute: Way imported &#145;that delicious sparkling Moselle&#146; for Blore's cheerful dinners  (CUL, Add. MS 8170, fol. 87). Blore, a founder member also of the Institute of British Architects (1834), retired from practice in 1849, resigning his surveyorship of Westminster Abbey, but he continued to draw, as well as to lead an active social life for many years at 4 Manchester Square, London, where he had moved about 1839. He died there after &#145;a long and painful illness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 13 Sept 1879, 1019) on 4 September 1879, and was buried in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex, on 9 September. He collected his drawings, including &#145;almost every example of ancient castellated and domestic architecture remaining in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries</span>, 352), and views of his own houses, into forty-eight volumes (now in the British Library). He left an &pound;80,000 estate among his four surviving children: Edward William (1828&#150;1885), fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge; George John (1835&#150;1916), headmaster of King's School, Canterbury; and his two daughters. His pupils included F. C. Penrose, Frederick Marrable, Henry Clutton, and William Burges.<br>
