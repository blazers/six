<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gilliatt <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Conner]</span>,  Penelope Ann Douglass</span>  (1932&#150;1993), <span class="occ">journalist and novelist</span>, was born at 16 Eldon Road, Kensington, London, on 25 March 1932, the elder daughter of Cyril Conner, barrister, and his wife, Mary Stephanie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Douglass. Both parents came from Newcastle and were connected with shipping, her mother's family as owners and her father's on the artisan side; as a boy her father begged in the street for the money to take a train to Haileybury, where he was given a scholarship. After practising as a barrister he joined the BBC, and eventually became head of radio in Belfast. Later he was appointed a quarter session judge. He and his wife, Mary, divorced when Penelope was eleven and a half, abandoning the house in Studland, Dorset, which had been a haven for all the family. Penelope and her younger sister, Angela, moving from one place to another round the country, were at one point taught by their mother under the Parents' National Educational Union system. Penelope then spent brief periods in various schools before going to Queen's College, Harley Street, London, where she finished her secondary education. From there she went to New York to train at the Juilliard School of Music, but became anorexic; it was soon realized that the emotional strains of a concert pianist's life would be too much for her, and she went instead to Bennington College, Vermont. She returned to London as a winner of the <span class="italic">Vogue</span> talent contest, which carried an automatic appointment to a job with Cond&eacute; Nast (dogsbody to the needlework section, in her case). She quickly moved on to writing features for <span class="italic">Vogue</span> itself. On 18 December 1954 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49652/', "Roger William Gilliatt (1922&#150;1991)")</script>, a distinguished neurologist, and son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33405/', "Sir William Gilliatt")</script>, obstetrician. They set up house in a chic flat in Knightsbridge.<br>
<br>From the late 1950s Penelope Gilliatt wrote for the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, <span class="italic">Queen</span>, <span class="italic">Encounter</span>, the <span class="italic">London Review of Books</span>, and many other newspapers, magazines, and journals. Chic, petite, almost pixie-like, with a wicked smile, vivid wit, and &#145;outstanding red-headedness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 14 May 1993), she became a star of the media scene that was just emerging as &#145;swinging London&#146;. She was a member of the Labour Party, and walked with her husband, Roger, for at least a short part of anti-nuclear marches. Nevertheless, by the early 1960s the marriage had cooled; she became involved with the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55236/', "John Osborne (1929&#150;1994)")</script>, son of Thomas Godfrey Osborne, advertising copy writer; she moved with him into an old mill house in Hellingly, Sussex, and married him on 25 May 1963. This move came in for a good deal of public disapproval, apparently not so much because Osborne had abandoned his previous wife, the actress Mary Ure, without seeing their three-week-old son, as because Penelope had walked out on someone who had been best man at a royal wedding: that of Princess Margaret to Lord Snowdon in 1960. The gossip columnists made a meal of this, delighted to get back at her for a searing article entitled &#145;The friendless ones&#146; she had written for <span class="italic">Queen</span> in which she attacked them for the inaccuracy and scurrilous nature of their columns. The article had prompted Lord Rothermere, owner of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, to discontinue the Paul Tanfield column.<br>
<br>The Osbornes did not stay in the country long, but moved into an impressive Georgian house in Chester Square, Belgravia, which Penelope's sister Angela, by then a celebrated sculptor, gutted and dramatized in true 1960s style: an immense refectory table dominated the ground floor, walls were removed, and shapes were changed. Meanwhile Penelope (as Penelope Gilliatt) continued her career in journalism, becoming features editor of <span class="italic">Vogue</span> and alternating as film critic with Kenneth Tynan in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (1961&#150;5 and 1966&#150;7). She began to write novels and short stories: <span class="italic">One by One</span> in 1965, and <span class="italic">A State of Change</span> in 1967, getting up at five each morning to write. She was devoted to Osborne&#151;with whom she had a daughter, Nolan&#151;but marriages to him seldom lasted, and in 1968 he left her for the actress Jill Bennett.<br>
<br>Gilliatt felt she could no longer continue in London and moved with Nolan to New York, where she wrote film reviews for the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>, contributed to the magazine <span class="italic">Grand Street</span> and other publications, and wrote a highly successful film script, <span class="italic">Sunday Bloody Sunday</span> (1971, starring Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson). This was nominated for an Oscar for best original screenplay, and won awards for best original screenplay from the New York Film Critics' Circle and both British and American film critics. She made a glittering place for herself on the New York scene, as she had in London, occupying a large flat overlooking Central Park, cooking excellently for her friends, and writing prolifically: profiles, reviews, novels, a libretto, a play, short stories, and several further film scripts, though no more films were actually made. But increasingly she kept up the level of her vivacity with drink. After an occasion when, writing a profile of Graham Greene, she muddled his words with her own to a lamentable extent, the job with the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> came to an end&#151;though the editor, still a great friend, continued to print her writing under a different name. Increasingly, she relied on drink, denied that it was a problem, and failed at various attempts to give it up. She returned to Britain, where she died on 10 May 1993 at her home, 29 Burnham Court, Moscow Road, Westminster, of postural asphyxia and cirrhosis of the liver. She was survived by her daughter, Nolan. As a critic and journalist she was one of the most sparkling personalities of her time.<br>
