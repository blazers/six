<span class="headword">Galloway,  John</span>  (1804&#150;1894), <span class="occ">iron-founder and engineer</span>, was born on 14 February 1804 at his father's house, 37 Lombard Street, Manchester, the second son of William Galloway (1768&#150;1836) and his wife, Elizabeth. His father had moved to Manchester in 1790 from Coldstream, his birthplace, and by the time John was born his father was in business in Manchester as a millwright. John was educated at a local school in Mosley Street until at the age of fourteen he became apprenticed for seven years in his father's firm, Galloway and Bowman, millwrights, engineers, and iron-founders.<br>
<br>John completed his time in 1825 and remained with the firm of Galloway, Bowman, and Glasgow for another ten years. When the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened in 1830 he became interested in the construction of locomotives and by 1833 had completed the <i>Manchester</i>, the first locomotive to be built in that city. The firm, however, built only about four or five locomotives in all. In 1835 Galloway, in partnership with his elder brother, William (1796&#150;1873), hived off from the original family business and established the firm of W. and J. Galloway at the Knott Mill ironworks, on the site of a former foundry.<br>
<br>The elder William Galloway died in 1836 and by 1839 the firm of Galloway, Bowman, and Glasgow had been wound up; but by this time William the younger and John Galloway had begun to make their mark as iron-founders and engineers. William and his wife, Elizabeth, had a son, <a name="cosubject_37439"></a><span class="headword">John Galloway</span>  (1826&#150;1896), <span class="occ">iron-founder and engineer</span>, who was born on 18 July 1826 at Great Jackson Street, Manchester. In 1840 he was apprenticed for seven years to his father and uncle.<br>
<br>In the early 1840s the use of gas was expanding rapidly and the firm of W. and J. Galloway began to execute increasing numbers of orders for gasworks equipment and gas pipes. At the same time the Galloway brothers were developing an early version of the double-fire flue boiler, a smoke consuming variation of the Lancashire boiler patented in 1844 by their great rival William Fairbairn. From 1848 the two brothers took out frequent patents for improvements to boilers and other parts of the steam engine, and by 1851 the &#145;Galloway boiler&#146; had been developed to the stage where it could be patented. In the next forty years the firm made nearly 9000 boilers based on the design.<br>
<br>From about 1850 most of the firm's business consisted of the manufacture of boilers, steam engines, and mechanical equipment for local cotton mills, but from 1852 it exported equipment for gunpowder mills in Turkey and cotton mills in Russia and India, in some cases also supplying cast-iron columns for the erection of the spinning and weaving sheds. At the same time the firm undertook some work in what would now be regarded as civil engineering, building a viaduct on the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway in 1857 and erecting the pier at Southport in 1860. These works, executed under the supervision of James Brunlees, were notable for the first successful use of high-pressure water-jetting in the sinking of cast-iron piles into sand.<br>
<br>One of the brothers' most percipient and profitable associations was with Henry Bessemer, a customer of the firm for twelve years before he asked them in 1855 to make the special equipment required for trials of his new steelmaking process. It is very likely that, in the course of extensive testing carried out by Bessemer and the Galloways at the Knott Mill ironworks, the first ingots of Bessemer steel in the world were produced there. In 1856 John Galloway and Charles John, son of the elder John Galloway, entered the business as partners, the firm becoming W. and J. Galloway &amp; Sons. Three years later John Galloway senior and his brother William became partners with Bessemer, along with others in the company he formed, to erect a Bessemer steelworks in Sheffield, for which they supplied the converters and other special equipment. Galloways subsequently supplied converters and equipment to a number of other firms making Bessemer steel under licence.<br>
<br>In 1872 a separate boilerworks was opened in Hyde Road, Ardwick, and thereafter Knott Mill works was devoted entirely to the manufacture of engines. The firm's largest engine was one of 10,000 indicated horsepower, supplied in 1888 to Palmers shipyard in Jarrow. In 1889 the partnership was turned into a private company, with a capital of &pound;250,000, and ten years later Galloways became a public limited liability company.<br>
<br>For more than thirty years from 1856 John Galloway the younger had been increasingly involved in the management of the rapidly expanding business, but after 1889 it was Charles John Galloway, the chairman and managing director, who effectively held the reins. John had acquired many other business and financial interests; he was also a JP for over thirty years, and with his wife, the daughter of William Crippin, he devoted much time to philanthropic and charitable undertakings.<br>
<br>John Galloway senior died in Manchester at Coldstream House, Old Trafford, on 11 February 1894 at the age of almost ninety. He was known in commercial circles as the father of the Manchester iron trade; Galloways has been described as the oldest of the large Lancashire engineering firms, and at the time of his death Hyde Road works employed 800 men and Knott Mill works 500. He never took an active part in public movements, though he was known as a Liberal in politics and a member of the United Presbyterian church.<br>
<br>John Galloway junior died on 16 December 1896 at his Manchester home, The Cottage, Seymour Grove, Stretford, Lancashire. He was survived by one son, William J. Galloway, at the time the MP for Manchester South-west, who was also involved in the family firm.<br>
