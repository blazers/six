<span class="headword">Castelvetro,  Giacomo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1546, <em>d.</em> 1616), <span class="occ">writer and teacher of Italian</span>, was born in Modena, Italy, and was baptized there at S. Barnaba, on 25 March 1546, the third son and ninth child of Niccol&ograve; Castelvetro (<i>d</i>. 1578), a wealthy banker, and his wife, Liberta Tassoni, a noblewoman. Apart from the fact that he described himself in autobiographical notes  (BL, Harleian MS 3344) as a sickly child, a condition he attributed to his mother, nothing is known of his early life.<br>
<br>Apparently as a result of his unorthodox religious views, at the age of eighteen Castelvetro was smuggled out of Modena with his brother Lelio in two chests carried on a mule, to join his uncle Ludovico Castelvetro, the humanist critic, who lived in exile in Geneva. For the next seven years he lived with his uncle, moving to Lyon, Basel, Vienna, and Chiavenna, while studying with him Greek, Latin, French, German, Spanish, and English. Shortly after his uncle's death in late February 1571 he moved initially to Basel and then in 1574 visited England, where he became acquainted with Sir Roger North of Kirtling, Cambridgeshire, whose eldest son, John, had recently graduated from Cambridge. Castelvetro spent the next two years accompanying young North on an educational tour of Italy, before returning to Italy to claim his inheritance after his father's death in 1578.<br>
<br>By this time Castelvetro was clearly a protestant, and fearing difficulties with the Inquisition if he remained in Italy, he sold some of his property to his cousin and namesake, returning to England by the summer of 1580. During this period he was engaged in the publishing trade, enjoying the patronage of Sir Philip Sidney, Sir Christopher Hatton, and Sir Francis Walsingham, for whom he probably acted as a political agent. He made frequent trips to Europe, including to the great book fairs at Frankfurt and Basel, where in 1587 he married Isotta de Canonici (<i>d</i>. 1594), the wealthy and elderly widow of Thomas Lieber or L&uuml;ber (<i>d</i>. 1583), best known as Erastus, the distinguished physician and philosopher. Having edited a theological work by Erastus, <span class="italic">Explicatio gravissimae quaestionis utrum excommunicatio</span> (1589), in 1590 Castelvetro published a collection of medical works by Erastus which he had edited, explaining in an elegantly composed Latin introduction how his marriage had given him this opportunity. In 1591 it was at his expense that the very popular <span class="italic">Il pastor fido</span> was published in England.<br>
<br>In 1592 Castelvetro realized a long-held ambition of becoming Italian tutor to James VI of Scotland and Queen Anne. Two years later, following the death of his wife, who made her deathbed will on 7 March 1594, he travelled to Denmark and then Sweden, where he was on friendly terms with Duke Charles, who was to become king in 1599. In May 1598 he undertook a leisurely tour of Europe, encompassing France, Switzerland, and Germany. In the autumn of the following year he settled in Venice, editing and preparing contemporary manuscripts on Italian poetry and fiction for the publisher G. B. Ciotto. His brother Lelio, after a long imprisonment, was burnt at the stake as a relapsed heretic in 1609, and Castelvetro's own stay in Venice was brought to an abrupt end in 1611 when he was imprisoned by the Inquisition. Although it is not clear if he had become a subject of James VI and I, he had been closely involved with the activities of the English embassy in Venice and had enjoyed the friendship of Sir Henry Wotton, ambassador there until late 1610. The new ambassador, Sir Dudley Carleton, successfully intervened on his behalf to persuade the Italian authorities that the incarceration of someone at one time a servant of the king, and now described as a member of the diplomatic household, could lead to a diplomatic incident. Once released, Castelvetro set off on another tour round Europe in search of patronage.<br>
<br>By early 1613 Castelvetro was back in London, and that spring taught Italian for one term at Cambridge to a number of appreciative students including George Stanhope, but his poor health and financial impoverishment precluded him from obtaining more regular employment. Briefly at Oxford early in 1614, he lived otherwise in the household of Sir Adam Newton at Eltham, later moving with the family to their new mansion at Charlton, near Greenwich.<br>
<br>At this time Castelvetro compiled &#145;Brieve racconto di tutte le radici di tutte l'herbe e di tutte frutti, che crudi o cotti in Italia si mangiano&#146; (&#145;Brief account of all the vegetables, herbs, and fruit &hellip; in Italy&#146;) for which he was eventually best remembered. His text bore all the inaccuracies and misnomers of an enthusiastic amateur, but was an interesting and instructive critique of the gastronomic delicacies of Italy. This was not the first text on the subject, but was probably the most detailed. Sent to eminent potential patrons, it was dedicated to Lucy, countess of Bedford, at the request of her brother John Harington, and Castelvetro hoped that she would help him to secure work as a translator, editor, and teacher, but by 1614 the countess was in dire financial straits and his attempts to gain monetary assistance proved fruitless. He was later engaged to edit a manuscript by Tadio Duni of Z&uuml;rich, but his hopes that the king or City of London might reward him for his translation of <span class="italic">A Remonstrance of James I &hellip; for the Right of Kings</span> (1615) were vain. He remained impoverished, dying after a long illness, probably at Charlton and soon after 21 March 1616, the date of his last autobiographical note.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Castelvetro achieved only limited recognition, but after John Florio, the first recorded teacher of Italian at Oxford, he was the most important promoter of his native tongue and national heritage in England at this period. It was only in the twentieth century, with reassessments of his career and the publication of his &#145;Brieve racconto&#146; as <span class="italic">The Fruit, Herbs and Vegetables of Italy</span>  (ed. G. Riley, 1989), that his significance as an advocate of the consumption of more fruit and vegetables was appreciated.<br>
