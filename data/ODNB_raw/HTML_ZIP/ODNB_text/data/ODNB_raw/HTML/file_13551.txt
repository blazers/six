<span class="headword">Holles, Sir  Frescheville</span>  (1642&#150;1672), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 8 June 1642, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13552/', "Gervase Holles (1607&#150;1675)")</script>, antiquary, and his second wife, Elizabeth Molesworth (<i>d</i>. 1662). Educated at the Middle Temple, he married Jane Crome (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1632), widow, daughter of Richard Lewis of Marr, Yorkshire, in 1662&#151;primarily, it was said, because of the fact that she brought &pound;5000 to the marriage. He was a major in the Westminster militia (in 1664&#150;7), while part owning and commanding the privateer <i>Panther</i> in 1665. His success in her brought him the recommendation of George Monck, duke of Albemarle, for a command in the navy, and on 2 October 1665 he became captain of the <i>Antelope</i>. Holles's conduct in the Four Days' Fight (1&#150;4 June 1666) was widely praised and led to his knighthood, although he had lost his left arm during the engagement. He commanded the <i>Henrietta</i> from June to September 1666 (taking part in the St James's day fight on 25 July) before taking command of the <i>Cambridge</i>, remaining aboard her until January 1667. During the Dutch attack on the Medway in June 1667 he commanded the fireships guarding the Thames. He was returned to parliament for Great Grimsby on 22 November 1667, quickly becoming a leader of the attack on the naval administration's conduct of the war, allying himself with the duke of Buckingham's faction and speaking in favour of religious toleration. These activities hardly endeared him to the court, and in 1669 he was removed both from his captaincy in Albemarle's Coldstream regiment, which he had held since 1667, and from the place as a gentleman of the privy chamber that he had held since 1664. In 1670 he attempted unsuccessfully to enter the French service, then went to Ireland, where he bought timber for the navy. On his return to England he went over to the court, becoming a close ally of the duchess of Cleveland. With the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War he returned to the navy, rejoining the <i>Cambridge</i> on 20 January 1672 and taking part in the attack on the Dutch Smyrna fleet on 13 March. The <i>Cambridge</i> served as part of the admiral's division of the Red squadron at the battle of Solebay, on 28 May 1672, where Holles was killed. He was given a spectacular funeral on 29 June in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Holles's two wills, the first dated 17 May 1665 and the second 25 April 1672, encapsulate his personality. Despite declaring in the first that he wanted no monument other &#145;than what my sword should raise for me of honour and fortune&#146;, the second was concerned chiefly with the planning of an impressive memorial in Westminster Abbey. He made generous legacies to his friends, notably his executors, the banker Sir Robert Clayton and John Morris, and his former lieutenant Richard Carter. This combination of generosity, bravery, and vanity can also be seen in the famous &#145;double portrait&#146; by Sir Peter Lely of Holles and Sir Robert Holmes, in which a swaggering Holles, sword in hand, is shown with no evidence of the lost left arm. Another of his former lieutenants recorded Holles's bravery and contemptuous disdain for his Dutch enemies (&#145;so base a nation which were never guilty of any brave action&#146;), as well as his recitation of poetry during a severe storm:<blockquote>
<div>Blow winds, beat seas, in vain you spend your breath<br>
</div>
<div>My fate's too great by you to suffer death.<br>
</div> (Ingram, 33, 41)</blockquote>Pepys's opinion of Holles was less complimentary. Virtually every reference to Holles in Pepys's diary is critical, if not abusive. Pepys described Holles's crew as &#145;the most debauched, damning, swearing rogues that ever were in the navy, just like their profane commander&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 8.272) and the man himself as &#145;a conceited, idle, prating, lying fellow &hellip; as idle and insignificant a fellow as ever came into the fleet&#146;  (ibid., 8.275, 9.76). Holles wrote his wife out of his 1672 will, but her subsequent discovery of the 1665 will which named her as sole executor and beneficiary ensured that Holles's legal and financial affairs remained in a chaotic state well after his death.<br>
