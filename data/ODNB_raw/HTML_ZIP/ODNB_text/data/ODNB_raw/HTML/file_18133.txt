<span class="headword">Marshall,  Edward</span>  (1597/8&#150;1675), <span class="occ">sculptor and master mason</span>, was apprenticed to John Clerke under the auspices of the Masons' Company of London; he became free of the company in 1627, a liveryman in 1630&#150;31, and served as warden in 1642&#150;3 and 1646&#150;7, and as master in 1649&#150;50. On 26 June 1627 he married Anna (<i>bap</i>. 1604, <i>d</i>. 1673), almost certainly the daughter of the sculptor Isaac James, at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, where their son <a href="#cosubject_18146">Joshua [<i>see below</i>]</a> was baptized the following year; they had a further eight sons and five daughters. By 1629 Marshall had moved to the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West in the City of London and he remained there for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Professionally, Marshall first emerges as a maker of church monuments. His signature appears on the finely detailed brass of Sir Edward Filmer (<i>d</i>. 1629) and his wife at East Sutton, Kent, and in 1643&#150;4 he was paid by the churchwardens of his own parish of St Dunstan's for &#145;altering the inscripcons in Brasse upon Div[e]rs grave stones&#146; (churchwardens' accounts, City of London, Guildhall Library, MS 2986/3, fol. 651; J. Page-Phillips, <span class="italic">Palimpsests: the Backs of Monumental Brasses</span>, 1980, 1.22, 76). Numerous other monumental brasses have been attributed to him; however, he was probably more prolific as a sculptor of memorials in stone and marble for in this field he is known to have signed at least eight works while two others are documented as his and over thirty more can confidently be assigned to him. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and tend to show strongly the influence of Nicholas Stone the elder who was roughly ten years his senior and whose career followed a similar path to his own. The memorial to Henry Curwen, for example, at Amersham, Buckinghamshire, which bears Marshall's signature and the date 1638, shows the deceased in his shroud, like Stone's famous effigy of John Donne, but he is flanked by two angels holding open doors, a device derived from another of Stone's monuments, that of Anne, Lady Cutt (<i>d</i>. 1632), at Swavesey in Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>From the 1650s onwards a second phase of Marshall's career, as a mason&#150;contractor, is traceable, though he remained active as a sculptor. Under the architect John Webb he built the portico at The Vyne, Hampshire (1654), and carried out work at Northumberland House in the Strand, London (1655&#150;7), and Gunnersbury House, Middlesex (1658). At Aynho Park, Northamptonshire, he appears to have worked to his own designs on the rebuilding campaign that began in the 1660s. He was appointed master mason in the re-established office of works at the Restoration and he retired from the post in 1673. Following the death of his first wife in 1673 he married Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> White, the widow of Henry Parker of Barnet. He died at the age of seventy-seven on 10 December 1675 in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West, and was buried there four days later. His family monument is in the church.<br>

<a name="cosubject_18146"></a><span class="headword">Joshua Marshall</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1628, <em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, the eldest and sole surviving child of Edward Marshall and Anna James, was baptized on 24 June 1628. He probably received his training from his father, and like him he held office in the Masons' Company of London of which he was twice warden in the 1660s and twice master in the following decade. In 1667 he followed John Stone as master mason at Windsor Castle and from 1673 he combined the office with that of master mason in the central office of works to which he had succeeded on his father's retirement. In addition to his work for the crown he was active privately as a mason&#150;contractor, being much involved with the rebuilding of the City of London after the great fire. He worked on St Paul's Cathedral and Temple Bar and built the monument and six of the City churches. He also found time to produce memorial sculpture, though in this field he showed no special talent, having a tendency to mass-produce designs which were themselves heavily dependent on his father's work. Joshua Marshall married Catharine (1649/50&#150;1716), daughter of John George of London, with whom he had five children, two of whom survived him. He died on 6 April 1678 and was buried six days later at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street. His wife survived him by thirty-eight years.<br>
