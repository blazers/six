<span class="headword">Llywelyn Bren</span> <span class="st"> [Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ap Rhys]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1318), <span class="occ">rebel leader</span>, was a man of large possessions and great influence in Glamorgan, where he held lands in Senghennydd and Meisgyn; his name may be translated as Llywelyn of the Wood. The earls of Gloucester were lords of Glamorgan, and were accustomed to rule their dominions with the help of the local lords, whether Welsh or English. Llywelyn's family had periodically resisted the earls, and his father, Gruffudd ap Rhys, had also supported Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, prince of Wales, in the 1260s. After the death of Gilbert, the last Clare earl of Gloucester, at Bannockburn in 1314, Glamorgan fell to the king as the guardian of the three sisters and heiresses of the deceased earl. Edward II's appointment of custodians of the lordship caused resentment, especially at a time of great famine; although Bartholomew Badlesmere (<i>d</i>. 1322) was conciliatory and returned some of Llywelyn Bren's ancestral lands and allowed his son to take office in Glamorgan, Payn Trubleville of Coety, one of the English lords of the Vale of Glamorgan, was appointed in July 1315 and acted harshly. Trubleville at once removed Llywelyn Bren and other officials to make way for his friends. Llywelyn angrily denounced Trubleville, who thereupon accused him before the king of sedition. Against the advice of his wife, Lleucu, Llywelyn went to the king's court, seeking reconciliation. But Edward II, who also faced Scottish intervention in Ireland, rejected his complaints and issued threats. Llywelyn was formally summoned to appear before the parliament at Lincoln, which assembled on 27 January 1316, but instead he returned to his own country, and, having taken counsel with his friends, rose in revolt. The quarrel was partly local, but it was also part of the longer struggle between English conquerors and Welsh lords. It reflected too the determination of the crown to curb the special privileges of the marches; the ending of Clare rule offered an opportunity to do this in Glamorgan.<br>
<br>Llywelyn began his revolt on 28 January 1316 with an attempt to surprise Caerphilly Castle while the constable was holding his court outside the walls. Llywelyn took the constable prisoner, and burnt the town, but failed to capture the main works of the castle. A large force of Welsh from the hills joined Llywelyn and six of his sons. Trubleville had no means of resisting such a force as the Vale of Glamorgan and several towns, including Cardiff, were devastated; an enormous booty was conveyed to the mountains. Edward was now at Lincoln, where, owing to Llywelyn's revolt, many of the most important magnates were absent from the parliament and little business was done there. Edward appointed Humphrey (VII) de Bohun, earl of Hereford and lord of the neighbouring marcher lordship of Brecon, to be captain of an army to put down the revolt. Hereford soon gathered together an overwhelming force. The neighbouring marchers, including Roger Mortimer of Wigmore and his uncle, Roger Mortimer of Chirk, Henry, duke of Lancaster, William Montagu, and the husbands of two of the Clare heiresses, Hugh Audley and Roger Damory, joined him with forces from the border shires, Cheshire, and north Wales, and even some Welsh soldiers came from west Wales. The armies converged on Caerphilly from Brecon, Cardiff, and Monmouth in March. Llywelyn, despairing of further resistance, offered to submit if his life, limbs, and property were spared. However Hereford would accept nothing but unconditional surrender, though he agreed to plead Llywelyn's case with the king. When the English army approached the mountain fastnesses of the rebels, Llywelyn told his followers that he had been the cause of the revolt, and that it was right therefore that he should perish rather than they. He therefore went down from the hills, and at Ystradfellte (18 March) surrendered himself and two of his sons to Hereford, who sent him to the king.<br>
<br>By early May 1316 Llywelyn, his wife, and five sons were imprisoned in the Tower of London. A commission of inquiry and punishment was already at work in Cardiff on 4 April, when Payn Trubleville was confirmed as custodian of Glamorgan and authorized to dispossess Welsh tenantry. But later in the month more conciliatory counsels prevailed; he was replaced by John Giffard, and many rebels were received into the king's peace. Hereford and the Mortimers urged that Llywelyn should not be too severely dealt with, and it was afterwards alleged that the king had agreed to act upon their advice. On 21 May Llywelyn's lordship of Senghennydd was granted to a loyal Welshman, Runus Bwl. Large herds of 1700 cattle belonging to the rebels&#151;more than half Llywelyn's&#151;were rounded up, and Llywelyn's personal possessions (including his archives and several books, three of them in Welsh) were seized in Llandaff Cathedral where they had been deposited. But the Despensers were becoming all-powerful with King Edward, and the younger Despenser, as the husband of one of the Gloucester coheiresses, hoped for the renewal of the Gloucester earldom in his favour; in November 1317 he secured the lordship of Glamorgan. He seized Llywelyn's estates, carried off Llywelyn to Cardiff Castle, and caused him to be tried, condemned, hanged, drawn, and quartered in 1318; he was buried in the Grey Friars at Cardiff. In the charges brought against the Despensers at the time of their first fall in 1321, the judicial murder of Llywelyn Bren takes a conspicuous place, and it was evidently resented by marcher lords like Hereford. The sons of Llywelyn were taken into Hereford's service in 1321&#150;2, but they remained excluded from their father's inheritance until the disturbances in south Wales that attended the final fall of the Despensers and the deposition of Edward II. They then were released and resumed possession (1326). Their names were Gruffudd, Ieuan, Meurig, Roger, William, and Llywelyn. On 11 February 1327 the government of Isabella and Mortimer formally restored to them their father's lands, &#145;of which they had been fraudulently dispossessed by the younger Hugh le Despenser&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1327&#150;30</i>, 39&#150;40). Their mother, Lleucu, received an allowance from the earl of Hereford at Brecon until 12 April 1349.<br>
