<span class="headword">Evans,  Ellis Humphrey</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Hedd Wyn]</span>  (1887&#150;1917), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 13 January 1887 at Pen-lan in the village of Trawsfynydd, Merioneth, and brought up at Yr Ysgwrn, a farm about a mile distant and facing Cwm Prysor. He was the eldest child of Evan Evans (1852&#150;1942) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morris (1862&#150;1950), a maidservant, the daughter of David Morris, blacksmith, of the same village. He received his elementary education at the village school and then helped his father on the family farm, although his heart was not in farming. The district had a rich Welsh-speaking culture in which poets enjoyed great prestige; the writing of verse in both the free and strict metres was the boy's only interest, and from the age of nineteen he began winning prizes at local eisteddfodau. Brought up in a religious home, he attended Sunday school regularly at Ebenezer, a Congregationalist chapel in the village, and was steeped in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, but, a handsome and naturally charming man, he was not averse to the company of young women; he had several sweethearts but did not marry. Under the influence of the poet R. Silyn Roberts, with whom he used to go fishing, he was attracted to socialism.<br>
<br>Although he wrote several lyrics of lasting merit, such as the one to the River Prysor, Hedd Wyn (the bardic name by which he was generally known can be rendered in English as &#145;blessed peace&#146;) is remembered mainly not on account of his poetry but because of his death in action during the First World War. Early in 1917 he enlisted with the 15th battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which left for Flanders in June, and was killed in the battle for Pilkem Ridge on 31 July.<br>
<br>At the national eisteddfod held at Birkenhead in the following September, and in the presence of David Lloyd George, who made a speech calling for victory against Germany no matter what the cost, a poem entitled &#145;Yr arwr&#146; (&#145;The hero&#146;), which had been posted from the trenches by a poet using the pseudonym Fleur-de-lis, was awarded the oaken chair, the prize traditionally reserved for the author of the winning poem in strict metre. When it was announced from the stage that its author was Hedd Wyn, and that he had been killed on the western front, the chair was draped in black, causing great emotion in the audience, and the usual pageantry did not take place. A number of his fellow poets then paid tribute in verse to Hedd Wyn, whose only ambition had been to win the major competition at the festival. To many in Wales, which lost a disproportionate number of its young men on the field of battle, Hedd Wyn's death seemed to represent the sacrifice of a whole generation.<br>
<br>The Irish poet Francis Ledwidge was killed at Ypres on the same day as Hedd Wyn; both poets were buried in the military cemetery at Artillery Wood near Boesinghe, where the Welshman's gravestone bears the words &#145;Y prifardd Hedd Wyn&#146; (&#145;The chief poet Hedd Wyn&#146;), a bardic title bestowed on those who distinguish themselves by winning the principal literary prizes at the national eisteddfod.<br>
<br>A collection of Hedd Wyn's poems, edited by J. J. Williams, was published under the title <span class="italic">Cerddi'r bugail</span> (&#145;Poems of the Shepherd&#146;) in 1918; it included &#145;Yr arwr&#146;, which relates the myth of Prometheus to Christian symbolism and was written under the influence of Shelley's poem &#145;The Revolt of Islam&#146;.<br>
<br>The sequence of <i>englynion</i> by R. Williams Parry beginning &#145;Y bardd trwm dan bridd tramor&#146; (&#145;The poet who lies heavily under foreign soil&#146;), often sung to harp accompaniment and the tune &#145;Troytes Chant&#146;, was composed in memory of Hedd Wyn; the bronze statue portraying the poet as a shepherd which stands in the centre of Trawsfynydd was unveiled by his mother in 1923. The film <span class="italic">Hedd Wyn</span>, made in 1992, was nominated for an Oscar; its author, Alan Llwyd, also wrote a biography of the poet, <span class="italic">Gwae fi fy myw</span> (1991). The poet's home, Yr Ysgwrn, which has not changed much since the poet's day, is now a small museum dedicated to his memory; among the artefacts on display is the &#145;black chair of Birkenhead&#146;.<br>
