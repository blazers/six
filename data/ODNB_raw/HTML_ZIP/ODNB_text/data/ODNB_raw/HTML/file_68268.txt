<span class="headword">Andrewes,  Bartimaeus</span>  (1550/51&#150;1616), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Bocking, Essex, of unknown parentage, and seems to have matriculated sizar from Jesus College, Cambridge, at Michaelmas 1570. Ordained deacon by Edwin Sandys, bishop of London, on 6 July 1574, he stated that he was &#145;of Braintree&#146;, had been born in Bocking, was aged twenty-three, and had lately been a scholar of St John's College, Cambridge. On 24 July of that year he was listed in an episcopal visitation as curate of Rochford, Essex, which suggests a connection with Robert, second Lord Rich, whose secondary seat of Rochford Hall stood opposite the church. On 13 July 1576 Lord Keeper Bacon presented him to the vicarage of Braintree, at Rich's petition. Why the benefice was deemed to have lapsed to the crown, so that its true patron had to petition for his own prot&eacute;g&eacute; is mysterious; as is Andrewes's resignation of the living within six months. But he was ordained priest, at Ely, only in December 1576 and had perhaps not yet graduated from Cambridge. Following Bishop John Aylmer's primary visitation of London in 1577, he was granted a preaching licence as BA, &#145;especially&#146; in Fordham, Essex, presumably under the auspices of the rector, Thomas Upcher. Andrewes is not heard of again in Essex. By October 1582 he was vicar of Wenham, Suffolk, and a founder member of the clerical conference which met in the Stour valley and is known to history as the Dedham classis. The eleventh meeting of the conference was held in his house.<br>
<br>Andrewes was a popular preacher. A course of sermons on the <span class="roman">Song of Songs</span> (1583; reprinted 1595), preached on three successive days (though where is unknown), was redolent with the rhetoric of godly fellowship. Those that &#145;truly love Christ&#146; were to &#145;be ever inquiring after him, comforting one another, conferring, meditating, praying, stirring up one another&#146;. Although disregarded as &#145;monsters among men&#146; (&#145;now these <i>Puritans</i> flock together&#146;) they were to invite both their families and their neighbours to the sermon, &#145;and I will go with you also&#146;  (Andrewes, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 185). One of his colleagues in the conference considered that Andrewes's gift lay &#145;rather in exhortation then in doctryne&#146;  (Usher, 45).<br>
<br>By 1585 Andrewes was looking for something better than Wenham. &#145;He had no comfort in that place, his heart was dead in it&#146;  (Usher, 43). And his living of &pound;25 was not enough. While the parish complained of his absence, he was preaching with a view to a ministry in Great Yarmouth. What followed is remarkable evidence of the operation of reformed (presbyterian or congregational) procedures in the Elizabethan church. A majority of the conference opposed the move to Yarmouth, and believed that they had the authority to prevent it. It would be the &#145;ruin&#146; of the poor church at Wenham. Moreover it could not be right to go from a pastoral charge to the lesser function of &#145;doctor&#146;. One of the bailiffs of Yarmouth, accepting the jurisdiction of the conference, waited upon it at an extraordinary meeting. One member told him: &#145;If I were one of that church, I had as lief they shouldest pluck out mine eye as take from me my pastor&#146;. Mr Mayham replied: &#145;But sir, if you cast out your eye you will give me leave to take it up&#146;  (Usher, 45&#150;6). By the next regular meeting, Andrewes was off to Yarmouth, where in 1585 the corporation agreed to pay him &pound;50 a year and to build him a house.<br>
<br>Yarmouth had been searching for some time for an acceptable preacher not under threat of episcopal suspension. In 1591 Andrewes was reappointed on &pound;50 &#145;if he be not put to silence&#146;, but was to receive only &pound;25 if he were, and two more preachers were appointed whom Andrewes had approved. In 1600 Andrewes was paid &pound;32 10<i>s</i>. His arrival in the town was evidently a historical moment, equivalent to the adoption of a thoroughly reformed regime. In dedicating a catechism to the magistrates, and &#145;all the whole congregation&#146;, Andrewes referred to a solemn promise &#145;at my first entry amongst you&#146; to promote God's glory, &#145;agreeable to his word&#146;, and acknowledged that they had kept their promise by electing faithful ministers, and the earl of Leicester as &#145;so wise and godly a Steward&#146;. It was the function of the public preacher to exhort the magistrates to public godliness, and Andrewes proceeded to do so:<blockquote>You must know that the burden of this people lieth upon your shoulders, and that their eyes look at you, as those by whose example the people either perish and fall, or are preserved and stayed up, for the fall and uprising of many dependeth upon public persons. &hellip; So shall you be famous in the Church of God and Common Weal. (Andrewes, <span class="italic">Catechisme</span>, dedicatory epistle)</blockquote>A new pulpit, 10 feet high, was erected in St Nicholas's Church, which, as one of the largest parish churches in England, was capable of accommodating six thousand communicants. Andrewes's catechism was a preparation for the Lord's supper, and the accounts of the church wardens suggest that the sacrament was administered with increasing frequency in his time.<br>
<br>Historians of Yarmouth have surprisingly little to say about Andrewes's later years in the pulpit, but he was still &#145;of Great Yarmouth&#146; when he made his will in September 1615, and presumably when he died, in May 1616. He was probably married by the early 1580s, but nothing seems to be known of his wife, Joan, who survived him. Andrewes's son and grandson were both baptized Bartimaeus. There were other sons, John and Samuel. Two daughters, Abigail and Sara, with their husbands, were left shares of his large house in Yarmouth. Andrewes died a person of modest substance, with lands in two Suffolk parishes, including East Bergholt, hard by Dedham.<br>
