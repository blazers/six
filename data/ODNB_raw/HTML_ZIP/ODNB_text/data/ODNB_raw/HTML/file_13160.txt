<span class="headword">Hexham,  Henry</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1601&#150;1650), <span class="occ">soldier and author</span>, born in Holland, Lincolnshire, was possibly the son of the Edward Hexham who served ten years in the Netherlands as an ensign and accompanied the English expedition to Cadiz in 1596 with the rank of lieutenant. Either his mother, or a sister of his father, was a sister of Jerome Heydon, merchant, of London, who was probably related to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13166/', "Sir Christopher Heydon")</script>. The cousin, John Heydon, to whom Hexham dedicates his <span class="italic">Appendix of Lawes</span>, seems to be <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13168/', "Sir John Heydon (d. 1653)")</script>, Sir Christopher's son. Further support for the connection exists in the fact that Sir Christopher's daughter, Frances, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28313/', "Philip Vincent")</script>, who wrote the commendatory verses prefixed to Hexham's translation of Gerardus Mercator's <span class="italic">Atlas</span>.<br>
<br>As a young man Hexham was attached as a page to the service of Sir Francis Vere, commander of the English troops in the United Provinces; he was with Vere throughout the siege of Ostend in 1601, and his narrative of that event, which is printed at the end of Sir Francis Vere's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> (1657), supplies some unique details about the siege. Hexham seems to have served with Sir Francis until Vere's return to England in 1606, whereupon he remained in the Netherlands, possibly in one of the towns garrisoned by the English. Hexham's continued residency in the Netherlands accounts for his personal acquaintance with Prince Maurice of Nassau and his brother, Frederick Henry. Hexham transferred his services to Sir Horace Vere, who had succeeded his brother Sir Francis and was governor of the town of Brill in 1610 when Hexham translated into English and published his first book, a protestant religious work entitled <span class="italic">The Refutation of an Epistle, Written by a Certain Doctor of the Augustins Order</span>&#151;the epistle by Dutch theologian Johannes Polyander. Hexham dedicated it to Vere and it contained an &#145;epistle to the Christian reader&#146; by John Burges, minister to the English at the Hague.<br>
<br>The following year Hexham published three more translations in the cause of international protestantism, including a Dutch translation of Thomas Tuke's <span class="italic">The Highway to Heaven</span>, under the title <span class="italic">De konincklicke wech tot den hemel</span> and an English translation of Johannes Polyander's <span class="italic">Dispute contre l'Adoration des Reliques des Saincts</span>, as <span class="italic">A Disputation Against the Adoration of the Reliques of Saints</span>, dedicating the latter to the puritan-inclined Mary, Lady Vere, and signing it as from &#145;our garrison of Dordrecht, 18 Oct. 1611&#146;  (Hexham, <span class="italic">A Disputation</span>, sig. A2). Hexham undertook the translation &#145;so that the grave men of our nation may see that the ministers of other reformed churches marches with them unto the Lords combate&#146;  (ibid., sig. A3), and he hoped that even those infected with the &#145;deadly contagion&#146;  (ibid., sig. A3&#150;4) of Catholicism would read it. Hexham was still in the Netherlands some twelve years later when his religious motivation in fighting for the Dutch was further confirmed by his <span class="italic">A tongue combat lately happening between two English souldiers &hellip; the one going to serve the king of Spain, the other to serve the states generall</span> (1623), which he was prompted to write after reading a pamphlet disparaging the policies of Elizabeth I and James I and &#145;the truth of the reformed religion wherein I was educated&#146;  (Hexham, <span class="italic">A Tongue Combat</span>, sig. A2).<br>
<br>Hexham acted as quartermaster to Vere's regiment at the relief of Breda in 1625. By October the same year he had obtained the rank of captain. He also acted as quartermaster under Vere during the siege of Bois-le-Duc ('s-Hertogenbosch) in 1629, at the capture of Venloo, Roermond, and Strale, and at the siege of Maastricht in 1631&#150;2. After Vere's death he became quartermaster to the regiment of George (afterwards Baron) Goring, with whom he served at the siege of Breda in 1637.<br>
<br>In the 1630s Hexham stopped his overtly religious publications in favour of military and other writing. His most solid literary work was his edition of Mercator's <span class="italic">Atlas</span>. This was a translation into English of the edition by Jodocus Hondius, but Hexham made additions of his own, and was further assisted by Hondius's son, Henry. The preface is dated Amsterdam, 1 January 1636 <i>stilo veteri</i> [os], and the work is dedicated by Hexham to Charles I; it was published in Amsterdam in 1636&#150;7 (2 vols), contains many maps and coloured plates, and remains the standard edition of Mercator. He also wrote and translated a number of battle narratives and technical military treatises.<br>
<br>In 1637 Hexham contributed significantly to the theory of the art of war, by publishing <span class="italic">The Principles of the Art Militarie Practised in the Warres of the United Netherlands</span> (1637), a work similar to Jacob de Gheyn's <span class="italic">Wapenhandelinge</span> (&#145;Exercise of arms&#146;) (1607); both books consisted of engraved plates representing the drill movements for pikemen, musketeers, and arquebusiers, and were specifically designed for the use of captains in the drilling of their men. Hexham's work heavily influenced <span class="italic">Directions for Musters</span> (1638), a pamphlet printed for the use of town militias, on the eve of the first bishops' war, as part of Charles I's &#145;perfect militia program&#146; (begun in 1628). Hexham's translation, <span class="italic">The Art of Fortification</span> (1638), from the original by Samuel Marolais, is said to be the first work on fortification printed in English in which the subject is treated scientifically.<br>
<br>In 1640 Hexham was in England, and on 27 July 1641 Edward, Viscount Conway, wrote to Secretary Nicholas that he had known Hexham as long as he could remember, and was sure he was a good protestant and would take the oath of allegiance and supremacy, which he did four days later, being then described as &#145;of St. Clement Danes&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1641&#150;3</i>, 59, 60). Four days after taking the oath he was granted permission to retire to the Netherlands. Hexham therefore took no active part in the civil wars in England. After returning to the Netherlands Hexham remained in Dutch service and busied himself with his literary work. In his book on army discipline, <span class="italic">An Appendix of Lawes, Articles, and Ordinances</span> (1643), he referred to the English civil war, writing that he wished to prevent the pillage committed on both sides by showing the means taken by the Dutch to check it; he also remarked that he had served forty-two years in the army and had never been wounded. Another important work was his <span class="italic">A copious English and Netherduytch dictionarie &hellip; as also a compendious grammar of the instruction of the learner</span> published at Rotterdam in 1647&#150;8, which he claimed was the first of its kind. It has a preface dated 21 September 1647. Hexham is last heard of in 1650 when he was recorded acting in the position of quartermaster to one of the regiments of the Anglo-Dutch brigade on monthly pay of 25 guilders.<br>
