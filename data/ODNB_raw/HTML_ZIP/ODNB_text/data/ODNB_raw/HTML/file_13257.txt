<span class="headword">Hildersham <span class="st"> [Hildersam]</span>,  Samuel</span>  (1594?&#150;1674), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13256/', "Arthur Hildersham (1563&#150;1632)")</script>, instituted vicar there in October 1593, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1640), a daughter of the Barfoot family of Lambourne Hall, Essex. Admitted as pensioner to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 6 May 1609, he graduated BA in 1613, proceeded MA in 1616, and became a fellow of his college in 1618. Thereafter Hildersham devoted his life to the promotion of godly living. He became a BD in 1623, and may then have been ordained by an Irish bishop without subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. Subsequently, on 13 June 1628, he was appointed by William Cokayne, merchant of Austin Friars in London, to the impropriated rectory of West Felton, Shropshire, a place which he was to serve faithfully for over thirty years. While there he published his late father's <span class="italic">CLII Lectures upon Psalme LI</span> (1635), and also married his wife, Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11003/', "Sir Henry Goodere (bap. 1571, d. 1627)")</script> of Polesworth, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>During the civil wars Hildersham became committed to the parliamentarian cause. In 1642 and 1643 he was one of the Shropshire representatives to the Westminster assembly of divines, and in 1648 he signed a testimony of local ministers supporting the establishment of presbyterianism within the county. In the 1650s he was an assistant to the Shropshire commission, and established close friendships with two influential presbyterians, Richard Baxter and Henry Newcome; the latter remembered him as &#145;a very noble friend to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.56). At the same time, however, he worked alongside Baxter, Newcome, and other ministers to establish links between presbyterians and Independents. After 1656 he was a member of the Shropshire Association, although this short-lived project was eventually abandoned at the Restoration. Following the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, he was ejected from his living at West Felton. He retired to Erdington in the parish of Aston, near Birmingham, a town free from the provisions of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span>. Ultimately, though, he eschewed open nonconformity after 1662, and remained at Erdington, where he died in April 1674, &#145;aged eighty&#146;. He was buried at Aston, without a funeral sermon, at his own request. His wife survived him.<br>
