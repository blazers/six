<span class="headword">Heywood,  Robert</span>  (1573/4&#150;1646/7), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was probably born in Heywood, in the parish of Bury, Lancashire, the eldest son of Peter Heywood of Heywood, gentleman (<i>d</i>. 1600) and his wife, Margery (<i>d</i>. 1602), daughter of Roger Gartside, gentleman. He was educated locally, and on 11 July 1589, aged fifteen, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, although he does not appear to have gained a degree. He subsequently returned to Lancashire and upon his father's death in 1600 he inherited the estate of Heywood Hall and property throughout south-east Lancashire.<br>
<br>At some point before 1607 Heywood married Margaret Ashton (<i>d</i>. 1665), daughter and coheir of John Ashton of Penketh, Lancashire, gentleman. The couple settled at Heywood Hall, which was reportedly rebuilt in 1611, and had six surviving children. From this point onwards Heywood gradually acquired wealth and an improved social standing. In 1618 he was appointed high constable for Salford hundred in Lancashire, and by 1622 he was listed as the second wealthiest landowner in his parish. In 1631 he paid &pound;10 for his distraint of knighthood fine.<br>
<br>Heywood also secured a local reputation as a prominent patron of godliness and learning. Between 1618 and 1624 he procured joint ownership of the advowsons of the nearby parishes of Radcliffe and Middleton, Lancashire. The later appointment of two puritan ministers in these parishes suggests that he moved easily within nonconforming circles. About 1640 he rebuilt Heywood Chapel, which lay upon his estates, at an estimated personal cost of &pound;150. At that time he was also composing poetry, although only one work has survived. His <span class="italic">Observations and Instructions, Divine and Moral</span> was a lengthy visionary piece, divided into five &#145;centuries&#146; that reflected his own godly perspective on the nature of faith and works. It may have been this work that attracted the scholar and poet Richard James to Heywood Hall during his tour of Lancashire about 1636. In his <span class="italic">Iter Lancastrense</span>, James recalled fondly to Heywood &#145;the fairnesse of thy seat and courtesie&#146;, and his welcome there:<blockquote>
<div>Such things I sawe and thought, in Lancashire,<br>
</div>
<div>At Heywood hall to trading Rachdale neere.<br>
</div>
<div>My safe bould harbour Heywood, much I owe,<br>
</div>
<div>Of praise and thanks to y<sup>e</sup> where ere I goe.<br>
</div> (James, 2, 12)</blockquote>After the outbreak of the civil wars in Lancashire, Heywood supported the parliamentarian cause, although he played no active part in the conflict. He became vexed by the behaviour of his sons Peter and John, both of whom were prominent local royalists, and in his final will of 8 October 1646 he stated that their legacies were to be paid only after their submission to parliament. He was buried in Bury parish on 19 January 1647. His godly reputation was affirmed by a distant relative, the nonconformist divine Oliver Heywood, who remembered him as &#145;a pious reverend old gentleman and an excellent poet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oliver Heywood</span>, 1.17).<br>
