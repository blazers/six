<span class="headword">Alanus Anglicus</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1190&#150;<em>c.</em>1210), <span class="occ">canonist</span>, was an Englishman who studied and taught canon law at Bologna. Little is known of his life. There is no firm evidence to support the speculation that he was identical with the &#145;Alanus, clerk of the lord pope Innocent III&#146; who held the prebend of Chiswick in St Paul's Cathedral some time about 1200. About 1192 he produced the first recension of his <span class="italic">Apparatus</span>, or commentary, on Gratian's <span class="italic">Decretum</span>. He was again in Bologna in the years from 1202, and produced a second recension of his <span class="italic">Apparatus</span> (<i>c</i>.1205). The apparatus to <span class="italic">De consecratione</span> (in four manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Apparatus</span>) is not certainly by Alanus. Following the work of Gilbertus Anglicus (an English canonist studying and teaching at Bologna at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century), Alanus assembled a decretal collection: of 484 decretals, 345 were by Innocent III, pope from 1198 to 1216. The first recension was rapidly succeeded by a second, which, with its glosses, was influential at Bologna. He also wrote an <span class="italic">Apparatus</span> on the decretal collection <i>compilatio prima</i>. Alanus's most famous students were Albertus and John Galensis. Alanus's academic activity ceases to be recorded before 1210. There is no firm evidence that he became a Dominican, or that a document, dated 1238, in the archive of the Dominican convent in Bologna refers to this Alanus.<br>
<br>Alanus made substantial contributions to political and legal thought. He was an originator of the well-known formula, &#145;the king in his kingdom is the emperor of his kingdom&#146;, a way of expressing the territorial sovereignty of kings. As he said in his apparatus on the <i>compilatio prima</i>, &#145;What is said of the emperor is held to be said of any king or prince who is subject to no one. For each one has as much right in his kingdom as the emperor has in the empire&#146;  (Stickler, 364). Alanus's English origins may have led him in part to the development of this idea, which should be understood against the background of the Roman law model of the emperor as universal temporal sovereign.<br>
<br>Alanus also developed the idea that spiritual power was superior to temporal. The trend among canonists commenting on Gratian's <span class="italic">Decretum</span> may be termed dualist: they presented temporal and spiritual power as being derived from God but existing in parallel. In the first recension of his <span class="italic">Apparatus</span> to the <span class="italic">Decretum</span> Alanus followed such an interpretation. However in his second, and better known, recension he expounded what may be termed a hierocratic argument: that the emperor derived his power from the pope. Alanus used the established &#145;two swords&#146; imagery: both swords, &#145;spiritual&#146; and &#145;material&#146;, were possessed by the pope, from whom the emperor derived his &#145;material&#146; one. The pope could judge and depose the emperor, who was his subject in both temporal and spiritual matters, though because Christ had divided the functions of clergy and laity, the pope could not directly exercise the material sword. During the thirteenth century, the hierocratic interpretation increasingly supplanted the dualist in canonist thought.<br>
<br>Alanus did place some limit on papal monarchy. He said that a general council of the church was greater than the pope in matters of faith, and that a heretical pope could be judged against his will. It was, however, as an exponent of the idea of papal sovereignty that Alanus was remembered.<br>
