<span class="headword">Poyntz, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1588, <em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">royalist writer</span>, was born at Iron Acton, Gloucestershire, and baptized there on 26 October 1588, the first son and heir of Sir John Poyntz (<i>c</i>.1560&#150;1633), later MP for Gloucestershire, and his second wife, Elizabeth Sydenham (<i>d</i>. 1595). On 14 June 1604 he married Frances Gibbons (<i>d</i>. 1638), and he matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 15 March 1605. In February 1626 he received the Order of the Bath at Charles I's coronation, and he was returned for Gloucestershire to the 1626 parliament. The following year he refused to pay the forced loan or to serve as a commissioner and was imprisoned, first in the Fleet in London, and then in Northamptonshire. He was released in time to sit once again for Gloucestershire in the parliament of 1628&#150;9. He was not an active member, although he did draw the Commons' attention to one of Roger Manwaring's sermons in favour of the forced loan, and was appointed to a committee to draw up charges against him.<br>
<br>During the 1630s Poyntz became involved in a protracted chancery suit over his wife's inheritance and in May 1637 he was briefly imprisoned in the Fleet after insulting one of the judges, Sir Richard Hutton. Later that year he was appointed sheriff for Gloucestershire, but warned that opposition to ship money was such that if he had to &#145;committ all the refusers, and distraine all their chattell &hellip; there will not be found either prisons or pinfoldes enow in the country to receive them&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/386/88). Poyntz did not sit in either the Short or Long parliaments: in 1642 he became a royalist and was summoned before the Commons for refusing to act as a parliamentarian deputy lieutenant. He was at Bristol for part of the civil war, and in the spring of 1649 he compounded for &pound;723 under the Bristol articles. His first wife had been buried on 12 March 1638, and by 1645 Poyntz had married his second wife, Cicely Smith (<i>d</i>. 1678).<br>
<br>In 1661, Poyntz published <span class="italic">A vindication of monarchy and the government long established in the church and kingdome of England</span>. This tract warned of &#145;the danger that cometh by the abuse of Parliaments&#146;  (p. 35) and argued that &#145;the best limited power &hellip; is regulated by the soundest, most perfect and equal lawes between the Prince and the people&#146;  (p. 143). He regarded &#145;unity in religion&#146; as &#145;the chiefest pillar that upholdeth the joynt obedience of the subjects to their soveraign, and to the lawes&#146;  (p. 8). He insisted that &#145;no pretences whatsoever can be just ground of a Civil War or Rebellion&#146;  (p. 153), and argued that &#145;by innovations &hellip; the peace of the Church and Common-wealth [is] indangered, if not destroyed&#146;  (p. 4). Poyntz was buried at Iron Acton on 10 November 1665.<br>
