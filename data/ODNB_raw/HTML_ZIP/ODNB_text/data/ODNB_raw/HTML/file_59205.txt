<span class="headword">N&iacute; Chonaill <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>O'Connor, &Oacute; Laoghaire]</span>,  Eibhl&iacute;n  Dhubh</span> <span class="st"> [Eileen O'Connell; <em>known as </em>Eibhl&iacute;n Dubh]</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1743, <em>d.</em> in or after 1791), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was one of the twelve surviving children of the twenty-two children of Domhnall M&oacute;r &Oacute; Conaill (<i>d</i>. 1770) and his wife, M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Dhuibh (<i>c</i>.1705&#150;1795), of Derrynane, co. Kerry.<br>
<br>The U&iacute; Chonaill (O'Connells or Connells) of Derrynane were a noted and prosperous Catholic family. Among Eibhl&iacute;n's brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20500/', "Count Daniel O'Connell (1745&#150;1833)")</script> and Morgan (father of Daniel O'Connell (1775&#150;1847), the Liberator). The women of the family were noted as poets. Eibhl&iacute;n's mother, M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Dhuibh, may have been a descendant of the seventeenth-century poet Piaras Feirit&eacute;ar; she and her sister Siobh&aacute;n are credited with a number of poems, in particular with laments.<br>
<br>In Gaelic tradition, both scholarly and popular, Eibhl&iacute;n retains her maiden name and the adjective Dubh (feminine form of <i>dhubh</i>, &#145;dark&#146;). She was married at &#145;under 15&#146; to an O'Connor of Firies, co. Kerry, who died six months later. In 1767 she married, against the wishes of her family, Art &Oacute; Laoghaire 
    (Art O'Leary; 1746?&#150;1773)
   of Rath Laoich near Macroom, co. Cork, who had been an officer in the Austrian army. He died on 4 May 1773, in a quarrel with a protestant neighbour. Folklore ascribes the cause of the quarrel between Art &Oacute; Laoghaire and Abraham Morris, high sheriff of Cork, to sexual jealousy or to Morris's demand to buy &Oacute; Laoghaire's horse for &pound;5 which as a protestant he was entitled to do. Morris and the soldiers who fired the fatal shots after a failed ambush by &Oacute; Laoghaire were declared guilty of murder by coroner's inquest in June, but Morris was acquitted by a grand jury in September 1773. The quarrel is the subject of the very celebrated poem <span class="italic">Caoineadh Airt U&iacute; Laoghaire</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Caoineadh Airt U&iacute; Laoghaire</span> survived in folk memory, with Eibhl&iacute;n Dhubh's name attached as the author, until it was written down in the nineteenth century. The earliest surviving manuscripts date from the 1840s. The poem has been much studied, praised, and translated and remains a controversial text in modern Gaelic scholarship. The manuscript versions show great variation and also include lines which occur in earlier <i>Caoineadh</i> (poems of lamentation); the poem exhibits several conventions of the genre, including praise of the dead man's house and family, exclamations of love, apparent reproaches addressed to other mourners.<br>
<br>Several academic writers have suggested that the <span class="italic">Caoineadh</span> was composed or rather performed extempore as part of the ceremony of lamentation or keening which is well attested as an essential part of the traditional response to death in Gaelic society. Others have pointed to the anomaly of seeing a woman of Eibhl&iacute;n Dhubh's class as a keener, and drawn a distinction between the folk custom and the lament as literary artefact, attaching Eibhl&iacute;n Dhubh's poem to the literary tradition while conceding its wide oral diffusion.<br>
<br>Some doubt has also been cast on Eibhl&iacute;n Dhubh's authorship of the poem. This seems impossible to determine from the evidence now available. The instability of the text adds to the problem; however, all versions are, to different degrees, remarkable for the speaker's energy in depicting herself, her own actions, and emotions. The speaker describes her sudden falling in love, her pleasure in marriage, leaping on the horse which came to her door with bloody saddle, her discovery of Art's murdered body, and in one version (possible tampered with by a scholarly transmitter) her drinking his blood. It expresses pride in her own and her husband's family connections and threatens Morris with an appeal to the king in London.<br>
<br>The poem also mentions two children of the marriage and a third yet unborn. One of the two who are named, Conchubhar &Oacute; Laoghaire (1768&#150;1846), was partly educated in France, became a captain in the <i>gardes fran&ccedil;aises</i>, later a barrister, married three times, and had a son who also died in 1846. Letters from her brother Daniel refer to Eibhl&iacute;n's son and grandson and record that &#145;it is however no small comfort to be assured there remains some livelihood for his orphans and widow&#146; (Collins, &#145;Arthur O'Leary&#146;, 1949, 2; O'Connell, 2.94). The date of Eibhl&iacute;n Dhubh's death is unknown but she was alive in 1791.<br>
<br>While the mutations of the texts and the many political agendas that have surrounded its transmission make the question of authorship, and the relation to the keening tradition, a complex one, it seems on balance sensible to accept that the poem belongs in essence to its traditional author.<br>
