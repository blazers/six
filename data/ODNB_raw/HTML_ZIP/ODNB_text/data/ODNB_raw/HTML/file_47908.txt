<span class="headword">Molesworth <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Carstairs; <em>other married name </em>West]</span>,  Andalusia Grant</span>, Lady Molesworth  (<em>c.</em>1809&#150;1888), <span class="occ">society hostess</span>, was the daughter of James Bruce Carstairs (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;1845) and his wife, Andalusia. Her family background remains obscure, although she was later to assert a connection with the extinct Bruce of Kinross baronetcy. In June 1824 she passed the entrance examination for the newly founded Royal Academy of Music: as Miss Grant she made her first public appearance at the academy's concert in the Hanover Square Rooms on 5 June 1826. She made her stage d&eacute;but at Covent Garden on 2 June 1827, when her &#145;remarkably powerful and sweet&#146; soprano voice was favourably received. Further performances as Diana Vernon in <span class="italic">Rob Roy Macgregor</span>, Lucy Bertram in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>, and Estelle in <span class="italic">Isidore de Merida</span> (in which she sang a duet with the celebrated tenor John Braham), and an unsuccessful production of <span class="italic">Edward the Black Prince</span> with W. C. Macready went to confirm the opinion that, talent as a singer notwithstanding, she was no actress. Singing with Braham in Bath in the winter season of 1830&#150;31, she accepted a proposal of marriage from one of the earliest subscribers to the Royal Academy of Music, Temple West (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;1839), a Worcestershire landowner. The wedding took place in London at St George's, Hanover Square, on 2 June 1831.<br>
<br>Andalusia West made her entry into respectable society; she retired from the stage and concert platform, and lived with her ageing husband at his house, Mathon Lodge, Malvern, and in Bath. By his death on 13 April 1839 she inherited all his property outright, and set herself up at 29 Half Moon Street, Mayfair. She made the acquaintance of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18902/', "Sir William Molesworth (1810&#150;1855)")</script>, the radical politician, to whom she became engaged on 10 June and married on 9 July 1844. The marriage met with family opposition on account of Sir William's frail health and Andalusia's age&#151;childless in her first marriage, she had few childbearing years before her. Her dubious antecedents and past life, and her social ambitions, caused unfavourable comment in society, and occasioned a permanent breach between her husband and his friend Mrs Harriet Grote.<br>
<br>Molesworth was returned to parliament in the autumn of 1844 after an absence of three years, and his new wife began her career as a hostess in earnest. Sometimes at their Pencarrow estate in Cornwall, but more frequently in their London house (1 Lowndes Square until 1848, thereafter at 87 Eaton Place), Lady Molesworth set out systematically to conquer the prejudices of the social and political &eacute;lite. During the first years of her marriage her guests included the literary lions W. M. Thackeray, T. B. Macaulay, and Charles Dickens (whose sister Fanny had been a friend at the Royal Academy of Music); by 1850 the political world had given its seal of approval in the presence of Lord Palmerston, Lord Lansdowne, and Lord Granville, and the editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, J. T. Delane, at her dinner table. By the time of Molesworth's death on 22 October 1855 the social world had given its approval also, with some of the grandest of the <i>grandes dames</i>, Lady Londonderry and Lady Palmerston, paying their arrears of civility. Of those who did not succumb to her charms her husband's family were the most prominent; indeed, his mother and sister considered that the social whirl in which Lady Molesworth preferred to live, of &#145;continual excitement for the last year and a half without an hour's repose has destroyed him&#146;  (Adburgham, 183).<br>
<br>The breach between the two parts of the Molesworth family was nowhere more clearly visible than in Andalusia Molesworth's will, by which she left everything in her power to leave&#151;and she had inherited from her husband all that was not tied up in trust&#151;to the nephew and heir of the man who became her constant companion after Molesworth's death, George Byng, seventh Viscount Torrington (1811&#150;1885). Within a year of her husband's death the entertainments in Eaton Place had resumed, and they were to be maintained for the following thirty years until her own death, which took place on 16 May 1888 at her London home. She was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Making a virtue of her musical background, Lady Molesworth's parties were distinguished for the quality of the musical entertainments she provided, but it was to her dinners, both to intimate groups of six or eight guests and to larger gatherings, that &#145;Moley&#146; owed her reputation as one of the foremost hostesses in London. Lady Dorothy Nevill recalled that &#145;although by no means brilliantly intellectual herself, [Lady Molesworth] possessed a mysterious power of drawing out clever people and making them talk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 146). Like Frances, Countess Waldegrave, the other great hostess of their generation, who was herself the daughter of that John Braham with whom Miss Grant had sung in the 1820s, Andalusia Molesworth overcame the prejudices of the day against obscure birth, poverty, and the stage to end her life as one of the most successful hostesses. Samuel Wilberforce was heard to remark &#145;I believe if the King of the Cannibal Islands were to come to England, within twenty-four hours he would be dining with Lady Molesworth&#146;  (ibid., 147).<br>
