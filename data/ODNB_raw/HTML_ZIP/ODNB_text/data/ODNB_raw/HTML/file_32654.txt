<span class="headword">Crump,  Charles George</span>  (1862&#150;1935), <span class="occ">archivist</span>, was born at Wyke Regis, near Weymouth, Dorset, on 9 April 1862, the eldest son of Charles Ashbrook Wright Crump, barrister, of the Inner Temple, then an instructor on the training ship HMS <i>Britannia</i>, and his wife, Helen Ann Crane. His parents left England with their family in 1872 and lived at San Remo until 1885. Charles, like his brothers Harry and Louis, was educated by his father, who also took private pupils, for the Indian Civil Service, and obtained seventh place in the examination of 1880, whereupon he entered Balliol College, Oxford, as a civilian in training [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>].<br>
<br>After graduating in jurisprudence in 1883 Crump proceeded to India, but after six months at Cawnpore he was invalided home for good; he retired in 1886. On recovering, he aimed at a post in the home civil service, and while waiting to compete worked under Sir J. A. H. Murray on the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>. In 1890 he married Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1946), younger daughter of the literary scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33870/', "George Birkbeck Hill")</script>, sister of Sir (Edward) Maurice Hill, judge, and sister-in-law of the economic historian Sir W. J. Ashley; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Crump obtained a post as clerk in the secretary's department of the General Post Office in 1887, from which in 1888 he was transferred as a junior clerk to the Public Record Office. Here he remained until his retirement with the rank of senior assistant keeper (which he held from 1916) in 1923. Although early in his career he was reprimanded for spilling ink on two court rolls, he was later trusted to protect <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> from air raids in February 1918, when he personally accompanied its removal to safer storage in Bodmin prison.<br>
<br>Crump's earliest considerable work was an edition of the works of W. S. Landor (1891&#150;3), but the historical and economic interest of his official duties led him away from purely literary tasks. He contributed to Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Political Economy</span> (1891&#150;9) and to <span class="italic">Social England</span> (1893&#150;7) by H. D. Traill. With two colleagues he edited in 1902 the <span class="italic">Dialogus de Scaccario</span> of Richard fitz Nigel (their edition superseded the 1711 text of Thomas Madox) and he was co-editor of the essays entitled <span class="italic">The Legacy of the Middle Ages</span> (1926). His extremely acute mind and attractive character are reflected in some degree in <span class="italic">The Logic of History</span> (1919), <span class="italic">History and Historical Research</span> (1928), and his one novel, a rather ponderous fantasy of academic life, <span class="italic">The Red King Dreams</span> (1931).<br>
<br>Crump's official work can be found in such publications as the <span class="italic">List of Foreign Accounts</span> (1900), <span class="italic">Calendar of Charter Rolls</span> (1903&#150;27), and the <span class="italic">Book of Fees</span> (1920&#150;31). He was an active member of the advisory committee appointed in 1912 by the master of the rolls to bring the Public Record Office into closer touch with historical scholars. However, his greatest service to history was his insistence on the need for the study of records in their proper setting as products of an administrative machine, and not merely as evidence of isolated facts. In this respect later historians and archivists are indebted to him. Crump was one of the group of eight original assistant keepers who played a significant role in the evolution of the modern Public Record Office. He died at his home, 179 Hampstead Way, Hendon, London, on 11 December 1935.<br>
