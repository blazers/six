<span class="headword">Birchington,  Stephen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1407), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and historical writer</span>, doubtless took his name from Birchington on the Isle of Thanet, Kent. He became a monk of the cathedral priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, in 1382. In the late 1390s he was one of the priory's two treasurers; in the opening years of the fifteenth century he held the senior post of warden of the priory's manors; and in around 1404&#150;5 he served as the prior's chaplain. He died on 21 August 1407, presumably at Christ Church, where he was probably buried.<br>
<br>In the account of the Christ Church monks by the late fifteenth-century Canterbury monk Thomas Cawston, Birchington is stated to have written about the lives of the archbishops of Canterbury. From this, and from John Joscelyn's references to Birchington in his mid-sixteenth-century biographical notices of archbishops of Canterbury, Henry Wharton inferred in his <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> (1691) that Birchington wrote the series of archiepiscopal lives in Lambeth Palace Library, MS 99. On the strength of similarities of style and method, Wharton thought that a chronicle of England and sets of lives of the popes and emperors in the same manuscript were also Birchington's work.<br>
<br>The lives of the popes and emperors are now known to be by the French ecclesiastic Bernard Gui (1260&#150;1331), however, and Wharton's other suggestions are countered by the fact that the chronicle ends in 1367 and the lives of the archbishops end with the accession of William Wittleseye in 1369; the life of Archbishop Simon Islep, who died in 1366, seems to have been written from personal knowledge, while the chronicle has various details about the 1350s and 1360s that only a contemporary is likely to have known. Most probably, therefore, both these latter works were written by a monk or secular clerk who was at least a generation senior to Birchington; Birchington's role was that of a continuator, and his own composition, which would have covered the late fourteenth century, does not appear to have survived.<br>
