<span class="headword">&Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh <span class="st"> [O'Clery]</span>,  Lughaidh</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1603&#150;1616), <span class="occ">Gaelic poet and historian</span>, was one of five sons of Maccon &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh (<i>d</i>. 1595), <i>ollamh</i> (court poet) to the O'Donnells of T&iacute;r Conaill (co. Donegal). His mother is not known. The &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irighs were one of the last great learned families of Gaelic Ireland, the T&iacute;r Conaill branch having served the O'Donnells for over two centuries. The &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh genealogies appear in a seventeenth-century manuscript in which Lughaidh and his brothers are the last generation of the T&iacute;r Conaill branch to be included.<br>
<br>Little is known of Lughaidh's life, other than that he was involved as a juror and commissioner in the land surveys in Donegal, leading up to the Ulster plantation. He is best known for his biography of Hugh Roe O'Donnell, which served as a source for the annals of the four masters. This undated biography covers O'Donnell's life from 1587 until his death in 1602. While it contains much detail not found in other sources, there are many errors, resulting from Lughaidh's desire to exaggerate O'Donnell's involvement with Hugh O'Neill in the Irish uprisings.<br>
<br>Lughaidh also participated in the contention of the bards, which took place probably between 1616 and 1624. The contention began as a poetic dispute between Tadhg Mac Bruaideadha (Brody, Brodin, Mac Dire) and Lughaidh, composing in support of the south and north of Ireland respectively, with other poets soon joining in. The purpose of the contention is unclear, but may have been a sympathetic effort to promote a Gaelic culture that was fast disappearing under English rule, a fact that was not lost on the poets themselves, as witnessed by the often wistful tone of their compositions. In all, thirty poems were composed, four by Lughaidh.<br>
<br>The date of Lughaidh's death is not known. Unlike that of his father and brother Duibhgeann, Lughaidh's death is not recorded in the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, suggesting that he was still alive in 1616, the terminal date of the <span class="italic">Annals</span>. This is confirmed by the fact that the contention of the bards probably did not begin until 1616, and continued for a number of years. It has been suggested that Lughaidh had died by 1632  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), but this is based on an assumption that he was the father of Cucoigriche &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, and that the latter had inherited Lughaidh's land by that date. However, the idea that Cucoigriche was Lughaidh's son is based on a letter written in 1842 by John O'Clery to John O'Donovan, in which O'Clery presented himself as the direct descendant of Lughaidh. In his letter O'Clery cited a will written by &#145;Cucoigri&#146;, dated 1664, naming the testator's brother as &#145;Cairbre&#146;. O'Clery identified both as the sons of Lughaidh, which O'Donovan accepted  (O'Donovan, <span class="italic">Genealogies</span>, 395). However, it is not clear that the will is that of Cucoigriche &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, and there is no corroborating evidence to support the suggestion that he was Lughaidh's son.<br>
<br>O'Clery's letter also added to confusion over the author of the biography of O'Donnell. As one of the sources for the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, Lughaidh's work is identified in the <span class="italic">Annals'</span> &#145;Testimonium&#146; merely as the book of Lughaidh &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, covering 1586 to 1602  (O'Donovan, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, 1.xii). This vague description eventually led scholars to believe that the biography was composed by Cucoigriche &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, identified as one of the four masters, and in whose hand it appears to be. O'Clery supported this idea in his letter. O'Donovan, who published the <span class="italic">Annals</span> in 1851, realized that Lughaidh had composed annals, which were used as a source by the four masters, but did not recognize these as the biography of Hugh O'Donnell, and in his edition he repeatedly referred to the &#145;Life of O'Donnell&#146; as the work of Cucoigriche. Shortly afterwards, Eugene O'Curry correctly identified the &#145;book of Lughaidh O'Clerigh&#146; as the biography of O'Donnell, believing Cucoigriche to have been the scribe, not the author  (O'Curry, 22).<br>
<br>Opinions about the style of Lughaidh's biography have also changed. Its language is archaic, apparently so even in its own day, as the four masters frequently used its facts but changed its style for their <span class="italic">Annals</span>. This stiffness may have appealed to Victorian sentiments, as it was described in 1894 as being written in &#145;literary but not pedantic Irish, &hellip; free from the archaic and sometimes stilted diction found in parts of the &#147;Annals of the four masters&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). However, by the twentieth century, attitudes had changed  (Hyde, 564), and more recently its style has been referred to variously as &#145;affected&#146;  (Foster, 38), &#145;disappointing&#146;  (Moody and others, 516), and &#145;repulsive&#146;  (Pender, 19).<br>
