<span class="headword">King,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1557), <span class="occ">abbot of Thame and bishop of Oxford</span>, was the second son of William King of Thame, yeoman, who was still living in 1508. He became a monk at the Cistercian abbey of Rewley, near Oxford, spending some of his time studying at St Bernard's College before obtaining his bachelor degree in theology in February 1507. He was university preacher on Passion Sunday 1512. In May 1515 he was appointed abbot of Bruern, also in Oxfordshire, and he became doctor of theology in March 1519. John Longland, bishop of Lincoln between 1521 and 1547, was a patron of King, and it was due to the bishop that he became abbot of Thame, probably in 1527 (the year in which he resigned from Bruern), following serious complaints about the previous abbot. On 7 January 1527 King was made a suffragan to the bishop of Lincoln with the title Reonensis (from the diocese of Rheon in the province of Constantinople), while on 15 April 1535 he received the prebend of Crackpole St Mary in Lincoln Cathedral, exchanging it in November 1536 for that of Biggleswade; he held the latter until 1542. In 1530 he is also recorded as vicar of Charlbury in Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1537, although he was a Cistercian, King was elected abbot of the Augustinian house of Osney, an appointment organized by John London and John Tregonwell, themselves acting on the instructions of Thomas Cromwell, to whom King was connected by the marriage of his brother William to Anne Williams, a relative of Cromwell's. This election was made simply to facilitate the abbey's surrender, which took place on 17 November 1539, the day after that of Thame.<br>
<br>King's reward was the new bishopric of Osney and Thame founded on 1 September 1542. He surrendered his office on 20 May 1545, but had his diocesan status renewed on 26 January 1546, when the new diocese of Oxford was established, with the former priory church of St Frideswide (part of the new college of Christ Church) replacing Osney as its cathedral. As bishop of Osney and Thame King lived both at Gloucester Hall in Oxford and at Thame Park (as his former monastery became known). Gloucester Hall did not, however, form part of the endowment of the bishopric of Oxford, and after Thame Park was conveyed to Sir John (later Lord) Williams of Thame, the brother of Anne Williams and an associate of King's, in July 1547, it is not clear where the bishop lived.<br>
<br>King remained bishop of Oxford throughout the reigns of Edward VI and Mary, apparently adjusting his religious convictions to suit the climate of the times, although his attendance at the trial of Thomas Cranmer in 1555 as one of the &#145;persecuting bishops that died before Queen Mary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 8.636) is at least consistent with his having preached a sermon at Stamford some seventeen years previously denouncing those who read the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in English.<br>
<br>Whatever King's doctrinal beliefs, his status as a patron of architecture is demonstrated by his work at Thame Park, probably of <i>c</i>.1530, where his three-storey tower completed the abbot's lodging range begun by his predecessor, John Warren; the most notable feature of the tower is the parlour, in which Renaissance panels of arabesques, roundels, mermaids, putti, and the like constitute a splendid sight above the rich linenfold panelling below. A heraldic frieze displays King's connections, with the arms of Norreys, Fermor, Longland, and others, as well as those of the crown, being represented alongside his own initials. Given this Italianate taste it is perhaps surprising that after King died, on 4 December 1557, he should have been interred in a tomb in Oxford Cathedral which is entirely Gothic in character, comprising an elaborately traceried tomb chest with vaulted canopy. It now stands in the south transept.<br>
