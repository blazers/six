<span class="headword">Gaskin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>France]</span>,  Georgie Evelyn Cave</span>  (1866&#150;1934), <span class="occ">designer</span>, was born on 8 December 1866 at Cliff Cottage, Belle Vue, Shrewsbury, the elder daughter of William Hanmer France, contractor's agent, and his wife, Frances Emily Cave-Brown-Cave. <a name="cosubject_62987"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Joseph Gaskin</span>  (1862&#150;1928), <span class="occ">artist, designer, and teacher</span>, was born on 16 March 1862 at 169 Great Lister Street, Birmingham, the second son of Henry Gaskin, journeyman decorator, and his wife, Harriet Brassington.<br>
<br>Little is known about Georgie France until 1888, when as a student at Birmingham Municipal School of Art she began to win prizes with designs for needlework, wallpaper, and metalwork. Her work reflected a new emphasis on decorative art in the teaching of the school, an emphasis by which the city council hoped to raise standards of design in local industries. It also reflected the enthusiasm of young Birmingham artists for the medievalizing themes and craft revival of the arts and crafts movement. Arthur Gaskin, who had studied at the school and taught there from 1885, was one of these artists. The careers of Georgie and Arthur Gaskin depended on this fruitful coincidence between the city's forward-looking civic ideals and the backward-looking romanticism of the arts and crafts movement.<br>
<br>Arthur Gaskin began to work as a decorative artist about 1890, when he took up black and white illustration, inspired by woodcuts of <i>c</i>.1500. He developed a linear, decorative style that is seen at its best in <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Calender</span>, printed at William Morris's Kelmscott Press in 1896. His work encouraged a flowering of book illustration at the school, and Georgie France's illustrations in the early 1890s followed his style. But with <span class="italic">Divine and Moral Songs for Children</span> (1896) she changed to a more distinctive style that suited the Kate Greenaway world of her imagination, with doll-like children in smocks and bonnets, drawn in fine outline and often in colour.<br>
<br>Arthur Gaskin and Georgie France were married on 21 March 1894. In <span class="italic">Divine and Moral Songs</span> Georgie wrote that the pictures were dedicated to her husband &#145;by his pupil and wife&#146;. But she was not his pupil in the marriage. He was a shy man who loved teaching&#151;tradesmen did not always escape the Gaskin household without a drawing lesson. She was grander socially, more intellectual, and more in control of the family, and she dressed their two daughters, Joscelyne (<i>b</i>. 1903) and Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1907), in the style of her illustrations, sometimes to their embarrassment. The Gaskins were a thoroughly artistic couple and their marriage embraced a working relationship.<br>
<br>Arthur and Georgie worked together and apart. For a few years about 1900 Arthur painted in tempera but found the paintings difficult to sell. About 1898 he started designing enamelwork; Georgie took some to London in January 1899. In summer 1899 Georgie and he started producing jewellery. Georgie did all the designing, Arthur contributed enamelwork, and they both made the pieces with assistants. About 1900 Arthur started designing metalwork, and in 1903 he was appointed headmaster of the Vittoria Street School for Jewellers and Silversmiths, a branch of the school of art in the jewellery quarter, where the mass of Birmingham's (and thus Britain's) decorative metalwork was made. His task was to improve taste in the skilled but commercialized quarter and, as emblems of this task, he designed several pieces of presentation silver which were then executed by colleagues skilled in damascening, niello, and other techniques. Meanwhile in the south-eastern suburbs of Birmingham Georgie was at work on the jewellery on which their reputation mainly rests. At first it consisted of silver wirework set with coloured stones and enamel, graceful and technically unambitious. Gradually the scrolls of wire were encrusted with colour and detail, flowers in enamel, tiny birds cast in silver, and, by the time of the First World War, her work was often richly set with gems, resembling seventeenth- and eighteenth-century work. (The largest collection of the Gaskins' work in all media is in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.)<br>
<br>In 1924 Arthur resigned from Vittoria Street and he and Georgie retired to Chipping Campden, in the Cotswolds. Arthur returned to wood-engraving and painting in tempera; Georgie designed jewellery until a few months before her death. Arthur Gaskin died on 4 June 1928 in Chipping Campden. Shortly afterwards Georgie moved to West Malling, in Kent, where she died at her home, the White Cottage, on 29 October 1934. They are both buried in Chipping Campden.<br>
