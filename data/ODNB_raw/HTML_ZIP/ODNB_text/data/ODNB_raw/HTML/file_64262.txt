<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Berlin,  Sven Paul</span>  (1911&#150;1999), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born on 14 September 1911 at 6 South Terrace, Fairlawn Park, Sydenham, in south-east London, the second of the three children of Karl Gustave Hermann Berlin (1885&#150;1972), a Swedish paper merchant (and nephew of the explorer Sven Hedin) who brought his business to London in the early 1900s, and his wife, Mary Louisa (1882&#150;1955), daughter of Joseph Hughes, the central figure of a literary coterie in late nineteenth-century London. In a family falling on hard times, education was piecemeal, but for young Sven it included a boarding-school at Kenley, Surrey, and the Crystal Palace School of Practical Engineering.<br>
<br>Berlin had no formal art education; he enrolled at the Beckenham school of art, but stayed for only six weeks. He then met Phyllis Groom (1910&#150;1960), a trained ballet dancer in need of a partner to form an adagio dance team to tour the British music-hall circuit. She and the Zelia Raye School of Dancing taught Berlin the necessary skills and techniques required for this part ballet, part burlesque dance, and together as Sven and Helga they appeared on stage throughout the 1930s with such stars as the Crazy Gang, George Formby, and Max Miller. Berlin's first published work, &#145;The adagio dancer&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">Dancing Times</span> in 1929.<br>
<br>On 4 December 1937 Sven and Helga were married, in Bromley, Kent, and that same year they visited the Cornish artists' colony at St Ives. They gave up the stage so that he could become an artist, his lifelong ambition. He worked as a labourer to make ends meet and in his spare time endeavoured to make up for lapses in his education by studying philosophy with Dr Frank Turk of Exeter University and art with Arthur C. Hambley, then in charge of the Redruth and Camborne schools of art. He met the resident artists of St Ives and soon became one of their number. His son Paul was born in 1940, his daughter Greta (also an artist) in 1942.<br>
<br>Berlin lost his job in a tin mine when he registered as a conscientious objector on the outbreak of war, but he later joined the Royal Artillery, serving as a forward observer at the time of the Normandy landings in 1944. A series of letters sent back from the battle zones of northern France to the art critic Adrian Stokes was later reformulated into <span class="italic">I am Lazarus</span> (1961), a much praised account of the front-line soldier's life under fire. Meanwhile, still in the services, he wrote the first biography of Alfred Wallis (1855&#150;1942), the St Ives rag-and-bone man whose na&iuml;ve paintings of ships and harbours so strongly influenced the more sophisticated artists of the colony. It was published in 1949. When he returned to Cornwall after the war, he found his marriage in disarray and moved to a studio which he called &#145;The Tower&#146;. He became one of the most active and colourful figures of the St Ives art community, painting, writing prolifically, and carving the severe granite of the region. His work appeared in nationwide exhibitions, including that celebrating the Festival of Britain in 1950, in which he was awarded second prize for sculpture.<br>
<br>But St Ives was undergoing an artistic sea change as a younger generation of artists supplanted the old school. Berlin became embroiled in a controversy which divided traditional and modern artists into rival factions. He formed the Crypt Group with like-minded fellow artists John Wells, Bryan Wynter, Peter Lanyon, and others. He also helped to create the Penwith Society in 1949, but soon resigned when he clashed with the major figures of St Ives, Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, who wanted a much more modernist exhibition policy than that which the liberal Berlin had in mind. In 1953 he and Helga were divorced, and on 21 May he married the artist Joy Fisher, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barlow (<i>b</i>. 1925), who adopted the name Juanita. (She was Ishtar in his books, and was later known as Juanita Casey, the novelist.) With Juanita and their son Jasper, born in 1953, Berlin left Cornwall in a horse-drawn wagon and travelled to the New Forest, where he lived for nearly ten years among the gypsies near Lyndhurst. An important film of his work as a sculptor during this period was made by the director John Boorman, and Berlin collaborated with the Swedish actor and director Mai Zetterling on a film of the Spanish gypsies. Among those who visited him at this time were Robert Graves and Ralph Vaughan Williams.<br>
<br>In 1963 Berlin divorced Juanita and on 6 September married Julia Pamela Lenthall (<i>b</i>. 1944), a distant relative of Alfred Wallis. They moved first to the Isle of Wight and then, in 1975, to Wimborne in Dorset, where Berlin spent the rest of his life. After an important exhibition celebrating the St Ives artistic traditions at the Tate Gallery, London, in 1985 and, in 1993, the opening of the Tate St Ives gallery, Berlin's work, both visual and literary, enjoyed a revival of public interest, and the two extensive volumes of his autobiography, <span class="italic">Coat of many Colours</span> (1994) and <span class="italic">Virgo in Exile</span> (1996), together with the reissue of <span class="italic">Alfred Wallis, Primitive</span> in 1992, were among the last of his published works.<br>
<br>In an artists' community which included Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson, Naum Gabo, Patrick Heron, and the potter Bernard Leach, it is a measure of Sven Berlin's stature that he remains one of the best known and remembered figures from those post-war days. The others may have been better artists and more formative innovators in a colony which was shedding the influence of the old school of representational or &#145;academy&#146; art in favour of modernism and the abstract interpretation of the landscape in which they lived, but Berlin's art remained firmly anchored in the vigorous bohemianism of the old romantics, such as that of his friend Augustus John.<br>
<br>Berlin's best visual art was his sculpture, and he was able to carve delicate images from that most inhospitable stone, Cornish granite. His line drawings, too, showed an empathy with natural things, especially insects and small animals, and he illustrated a number of books on natural history. He published several semi-autobiographical books of a philosophical nature, but the poetry he wrote profusely was not collected or published in his lifetime. On 7 September 1962 he published <span class="italic">The Dark Monarch</span>, ostensibly a fiction set in an imaginary artists' colony. Eight days later it was withdrawn and pulped, after four successful writs for libel were served by those of his fellow artists who recognized themselves as the inhabitants of the &#145;fantasy&#146; town of Cuckoo, a place that was transparently St Ives. In art circles <span class="italic">The Dark Monarch</span> remained one of the best-known unread books until, in 2009, a new edition was published, which contained a &#145;key&#146; written by Berlin identifying the characters in the book with their real-life counterparts. It chronicles, in strong partisan language, the rift between the colony's artists and the causes of Berlin's self-imposed exile from St Ives.<br>
<br>Berlin believed himself to have been ostracized, not only by the art community of St Ives, but by the wider art establishment, but when he returned to St Ives forty years later to sign copies of his autobiography <span class="italic">Coat of many Colours</span>, he found old sins forgiven, his <i>enfant terrible</i> reputation more cherished than deplored, and his art enjoying something of a renaissance. In 1991 he declined an invitation to republish <span class="italic">The Dark Monarch</span> in its original form, saying (in <span class="italic">Virgo in Exile</span>) he &#145;did not want to be responsible for the forces it would release&#146;. He was, by then, one of the last survivors of the post-war days.<br>
<br>Berlin spent his last years in Wimborne, stone-cutting, painting, and writing with undiminished energy, his last letters being written only a few days before he died of septicaemia in Poole Hospital on 14 December 1999, at the age of eighty-eight. He was buried in Holt cemetery, near Wimborne.<br>
