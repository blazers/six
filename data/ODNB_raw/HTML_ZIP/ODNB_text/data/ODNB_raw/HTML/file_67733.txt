<span class="headword">Primrose,  William</span>  (1904&#150;1982), <span class="occ">viola player</span>, was born on 23 August 1904 at 18 Wilton Drive, Glasgow, the elder son and the first of the three children of John Primrose, an orchestral violinist, and his wife, Margaret McInnis Whiteside (1872/3&#150;1962). His parents, lowland Scots of modest means, sent him to local council schools, but the focus of his education was musical. Given a quarter-sized violin when he was four, the boy had promptly played a melody at perfect pitch. For ten years Willie Primrose took violin lessons from Camillo Ritter, an expatriate Austrian who had studied with Otakar &#352;ev&#269;ik and Joseph Joachim. He appeared in a few Congregational church concerts, but nobody let him know that his talent was prodigious (though Ritter did persuade him to give up boxing for the sake of his hands).<br>
<br>In 1919 Primrose performed before Landon Ronald, who helped him to a scholarship at the Guildhall School of Music in London. Max Mossel's tuition left him cold, but he emulated violinists heard at concerts: Fritz Kreisler inspired the sweetness of tone for which Primrose was later famous. These years saw him polishing his manners too. Sharp-nosed, straight-backed, and well-groomed, the young Scot assumed a gentlemanly persona (and wore a pencil moustache when fashionable). Following his d&eacute;but at Queen's Hall in 1923, he left the Guildhall with a gold medal in 1924.<br>
<br>Despite fair success as a soloist, Primrose grew worried that his playing had ceased to improve. He consulted Eug&egrave;ne Ysa&yuml;e in 1926 and spent many months at Le Zoute-sur-Mer during the next three years, deriving fresh motivation and technical refinement from the ageing Belgian virtuoso, to whom he admitted that he really preferred the sound of the viola to that of the violin. Chamber-music performance gave him most pleasure, he explained, and the weakest member of the ensemble was usually the viola player. By 1928 he was contemplating a change: instead of being one fine violinist among very many, might he not become a uniquely fine violist? Ysa&yuml;e told him to follow his inclination; others said that to switch would be professional suicide, as the viola was a secondary instrument without prestige.<br>
<br>Primrose joined the London String Quartet on viola in March 1930&#151;to the furious despair of his father. John Primrose, rather an Anglophobe, had already taken exception to William's marriage on 2 October 1928 to Dorothy Fanny Friend (1899/1900&#150;1951), an Englishwoman, and he found this musical apostasy unforgivable. The estrangement lasted many years, despite the high reputation of the London String Quartet, which toured Europe and America until it disbanded in 1935.<br>
<br>For a while Primrose struggled to find employment. Orchestras hired him for major viola works, but only Berlioz's <span class="italic">Harold in Italy</span> and Mozart's <span class="italic">Sinfonia concertante</span> (K364) were programmed with any frequency. Regardless of the efforts of Lionel Tertis (1876&#150;1975), the viola was not recognized as a solo instrument. In 1937 Primrose went to the USA to join the new NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini, and NBC had him head the subsidiary Primrose Quartet (1939&#150;41). He condemned diffidence in chamber music: a virtuoso quartet should mean four virtuosos. Later he recorded with Jascha Heifetz and Gregor Piatigorsky and performed with the Festival Piano Quartet (1954&#150;62).<br>
<br>Colleagues found Bill Primrose a no-nonsense character of equable temperament who did not romanticize his calling. His mode of life was methodical, and he relaxed by watching soccer and boxing and playing golf and chess. Yet he had his sensitivities, such as an aversion to performing in casual surroundings and a preference that an orchestra should never engage him rather than do so just the once (lest people wonder why he was not asked back). His recordings for Columbia and RCA Victor rarely satisfied him.<br>
<br>On the mistaken assumption that Toscanini was retiring, Primrose resigned from the NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1941 and relaunched his career as a soloist. Concert promoters remained disappointingly sceptical of the viola's appeal until a chance encounter on 57th Street, New York, provided a breakthrough. The popular tenor Richard Crooks asked Primrose to tour the USA as his supporting act, and they ended up working together for four years. Once the big-name singer had drawn the audiences, the violist used his outstanding technique to win them over to his instrument (even if this meant resorting to hackneyed crowd-pleasers such as Ethelbert Nevin's <span class="italic">The Rosary</span>). He played Amati, Stradivari, and Guarneri violas without a shoulder rest and eschewed heavy vibrato. By 1945 Primrose had become a star in his own right: &#145;The world's greatest violist&#146;.<br>
<br>Although he made many arrangements and transcriptions of pieces written for other instruments, Primrose insisted that the viola had a distinct &#145;personality&#146;: it was not just a low-tuned violin. He commissioned viola concertos from Quincy Porter (1948), B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k (1949), Edmund Rubbra (1952), Peter Fricker (1952), and Darius Milhaud (1955), and performed the Bart&oacute;k over a hundred times once he had overcome the phobia of flying which threatened his international career around 1950.<br>
<br>Widowed in 1951, Primrose married Alice Virginia French from Iowa in 1952, in which year he was appointed CBE and took US citizenship. He had two daughters from his first marriage and one son from the second. World-class orchestras competed to book him, but he began to suffer from whistling in his ears. Chronic tinnitus curtailed his recording career in 1958 and a heart attack precipitated his retirement from the platform in 1963.<br>
<br>Primrose latterly devoted his time to teaching, basing himself first at the University of Southern California (1961&#150;5) and then at Indiana University (1965&#150;72), while making visits to New York and Tokyo. Three books outline his approach. His last decade was transformed by Hiroko Sawa, a Japanese violin teacher, whom he married in 1978 during two years spent in Australia. Although ailing, he was guest lecturer at Brigham Young University from 1979 until his death from cancer at Provo, Utah, USA, on 1 May 1982.<br>
<br>William Primrose was the foremost viola player of the twentieth century. His influence on the technique, repertoire, and status of the instrument seemed certain to endure.<br>
