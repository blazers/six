<span class="headword">Outram,  George</span>  (1805&#150;1856), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 25 March 1805 at Clyde ironworks, Glasgow, second son of Joseph Outram (1771&#150;1830), manager of the ironworks and later shipowner, and Elizabeth, daughter of George Knox of Craigleith. His uncle was the engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20959/', "Benjamin Outram (bap. 1764, d. 1805)")</script>. About 1807 Joseph Outram moved to Leith, where George attended the high school. He proceeded to the University of Edinburgh, and in 1827 he became a member of the Faculty of Advocates, but after ten years of a legal career he readily accepted the post of editor at the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>. Outram's attitude towards the law is reflected in the witty, satirical tones of <span class="italic">Legal Lyrics and Metrical Illustrations of the Scotch Form of Process</span>, initially printed for private circulation among friends and colleagues (1851), and ultimately reprinted several times after his death, reaching a wider readership in spite of its heavy dependence on Scottish dialect. <span class="italic">Legal Lyrics</span> was initially printed under the pseudonym Quizdom Rumfunidos. The work was published posthumously by Blackwoods under Outram's own name in 1874 as <span class="italic">Lyrics Legal and Miscellaneous</span>, introduced by Henry Glassford Bell. A new edition in 1887 was edited by J. H. Stoddard, a later editor of the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>. Additional pieces were added, and corrections made. A final edition appeared in 1916, published by Foulis Press. The best known of Outram's poems, &#145;The Annuity&#146;, was in the public domain far earlier, as it was anonymously published in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London Magazine</span> in December 1854. Outram also worked with John Wilson on his Christopher North articles, &#145;Dies boreales&#146;, in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> in the 1840s and early 1850s.<br>
<br>As a lawyer, Outram lived and worked in Edinburgh, where he was a member of the Edinburgh Angling Club. In Edinburgh he met his wife, Frances McRobbie, daughter of William McRobbie of Smallwood, Jamaica. They were married in Edinburgh on 28 November 1837. A few months after accepting the editorship of the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> in May 1837 (at &pound;400 a year), Outram was offered a partnership in the business to which he gave his name, holding four of the twenty-eight shares, worth a nominal &pound;100 each. He settled in Glasgow, where his family grew to four sons and one daughter. The daughter died in infancy, and the last of the sons died in 1887.<br>
<br>As an editor Outram was moderate in tone and conservative by nature, but moved to indignant support of causes he favoured, such as Scottish nationalism. He was a member of the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights Movement, using his newspaper to advocate its cause, incidentally managing some gibes at <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (an Edinburgh publication) for its apparent lack of patriotism. Outram was also responsible for reversing the <span class="italic">Herald</span>'s anti-cornlaw policy. Under Outram's benign and stable editorship the circulation of the paper almost doubled to 4500 copies per issue.<br>
<br>Outram died on 16 September 1856, of liver disease, at Rosemore, on the Holy Loch, and was buried in Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh. He was survived by his wife. His name was perpetuated in the publishing firm of Outram (George) &amp; Co.<br>
