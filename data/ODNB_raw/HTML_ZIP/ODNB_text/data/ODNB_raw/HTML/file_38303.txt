<span class="headword">Collins,  Thomas</span>  (1775&#150;1806), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Chichester, Sussex, the son of Thomas Court (professionally known as Thomas Collins), originally of Edinburgh, and his wife, the former Mrs King, an actress. Thomas Collins senior was co-manager with James Davies of the Salisbury Comedians, whose circuit of theatres was based in Salisbury, Winchester, Chichester, Southampton, Newport, and later Portsmouth. The young Collins was sent to Bath to study music under Brooks, the violinist and leader of the orchestra at the Theatre Royal, but when he returned to Chichester in 1793 he forsook instrumental music for a place as a light comedian in his father's company.<br>
<br>Over the next nine years Collins established himself on the performance-circuit as a romantic tenor, able to play dialect roles and to move nimbly about the stage, a trait he inherited from his father. He performed such characters as Gunnel, a young sailor, in <span class="italic">Netley Abbey</span> by William Pearce and Motley, the jester in M. G. Lewis's <span class="italic">The Castle Spectre</span>. James Davies's daughter Henrietta, who had appeared on the stage since her childhood, often performed with Collins, and in 1795 the two were married. Their child died at Southampton in 1797.<br>
<br>Collins was invited by Richard Brinsley Sheridan to join the company at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Presumably Sheridan saw the young man at the theatre in Jewry Street during one of his visits to Winchester, where Sheridan was courting Esther Jane Ogle, the daughter of the dean. An actor named Sheridan, possibly a cousin of the London manager, was a member of the Collins&#150;Davies company. In 1802 Collins transferred to London together with Andrew Cherry, the dialect comedian and playwright. Sheridan had employed both men to replace Thomas King, the retiring comic lead who had established the role of Sir Peter Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. For his opening role Collins took the part of Jabal, servant to Sheva in Richard Cumberland's sentimental play <span class="italic">The Jew</span>, gaining commendations. This was followed by <span class="italic">Fortune's Frolic</span> by John Till Allingham, in which the new member played Robin Roughhead. &#145;We have no doubt that Mr Collins will become a favourite with the public&#146;, wrote a London correspondent to the <span class="italic">Hampshire Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>That same year Sheridan revived <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, in which Collins played Slender, a part, <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted (27 October 1802), he &#145;fooled &hellip; to the top of his bent; his simplicity was irresistibly laughable&#146;. Samuel De Wilde painted the actor in this role, clad in brown and blue, looking out towards his audience from a background representing Windsor Forest.<br>
<br>In 1804 Collins established the role of Timothy Quaint in Cherry's popular comedy <span class="italic">The Soldier's Daughter</span>, surrounded by long-serving members of the company. Nevertheless, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, it was to Collins that Cherry presented a portrait of Quaint inscribed:<blockquote>
<div>Honest Tim, when this you view,<br>
</div>
<div>Remember who created you,<br>
</div>
<div>Not man, nor mortal, sage or saint,<br>
</div>
<div>Hath made you Tim, but Nature, Quaint.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 484)</blockquote>The painting is unidentified. Later De Wilde painted a full length of Collins in this role in 1805.<br>
<br>The young actor was summed up as a &#145;promising genius in his line of acting&#146;. The <span class="italic">Thespian Dictionary</span> said his humour lay in a &#145;peculiarity in his voice and manner&#146;. Collins realized his limitations and began to experiment with character parts, disguising himself in a brown wig to play Old Dubbs in <span class="italic">The Dash</span>. Little time was left to him, though. Frenetic performances and a predominating nasal twang were caused by vocal strain, tiredness, and illness. Collins's condition worsened when, in March 1806, Henrietta died. She had been childhood sweetheart, wife, and colleague to the actor. Two months later, on 4 May, Thomas Collins also died, at a lodging in Brompton Row, Chelsea.<br>
