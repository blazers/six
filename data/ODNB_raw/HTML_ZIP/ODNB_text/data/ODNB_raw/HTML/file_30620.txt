<span class="headword">Ward,  Robert McGowan  Barrington-</span>  (1891&#150;1948), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Worcester on 23 February 1891, the fourth son of Mark James Barrington-Ward (<i>d</i>. 1924), an inspector of schools and later rector of Duloe, Cornwall, and his wife, Caroline Pearson. The surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30619/', "Lancelot Edward Barrington-Ward")</script> was an elder brother. He was educated at Westminster School, where he gained distinction in the classics and was captain of the school, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship (1909&#150;13). At Oxford he wrote light verse for university magazines, and became president of the union in 1912. Having obtained a second in classical moderations (1911) and a third in Greats (1913), and been awarded the Tancred scholarship at Lincoln's Inn in 1911, he had intended to embark upon a legal career. However, a parallel interest in journalism resulted in a fortunate introduction to Geoffrey Robinson (later Geoffrey Dawson), then editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Barrington-Ward joined the staff of the newspaper in 1913, and showed sufficient promise to be made editorial secretary in February 1914. He contributed the chapter &#145;The foreign office and its agencies&#146; to the <span class="italic">Oxford Survey of the British Empire</span> (1914).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in August 1914, Barrington-Ward was commissioned in the 6th battalion of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry, and he became battalion adjutant in 1916. Wounded at Bellacourt in 1917, he became brigade major of the 174th infantry brigade, and in 1918 he wrote <span class="italic">Platoon Fighting</span>, an attempt to apply the tactical lessons of the fighting on the western front. He was a brave soldier who was awarded both the MC (1917) and the DSO (1918).<br>
<br>Like many young men of his generation, Barrington-Ward was &#145;marked by the trenches&#146;  (Cowling, 128) and fearful of another war, and was a strong supporter of the League of Nations. He covered the peace negotiations for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in Paris and sympathized with German grievances, a sentiment which was shared by many in Britain. During the 1920s his belief in the need for a revision of the Versailles treaty was reinforced by French policy (particularly the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923), and he came to epitomize the unease felt by many about the treatment of Germany at Versailles, dragging the &#145;nation's self-forged fetters around with him and [raising] his voice in grief-stricken means of self reproach&#146;  (Lentin, 150).<br>
<br>Although called to the bar in 1919, Barrington-Ward decided to follow a career in journalism, and spent eight years as assistant editor to <span class="italic">The Observer</span> under J. L. Garvin (who shared his views on the Versailles treaty) before returning to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in October 1927, as assistant editor under Geoffrey Dawson. In 1926 he married Margaret Adele (<i>d</i>. 1974), daughter of Evasio Radice of the Indian Civil Service; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>As the position of foreign editor was abolished in 1928, Barrington-Ward and Geoffrey Dawson were responsible for <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s coverage of foreign affairs. Barrington-Ward was also chief leader writer. A particular interest was Anglo-German affairs, and he remained convinced that the treaty of Versailles had been misconceived. Although no admirer of Nazism, he hoped for an accommodation with the Hitler government. Thus, two days after the Germans illegally re-entered the demilitarized Rhineland on 7 March 1936, the <span class="italic">Times</span> leader (written by Barrington-Ward) was headed &#145;A chance to rebuild&#146;. &#145;As to British opinion generally,&#146; he wrote to A. L. Kennedy on 24 March, &#145;our difficulty has been to find enough letters stating what might crudely be called the anti-German view to balance the correspondence&#146;. In the same letter he lamented that Britain was &#145;&#147;tied and bound by the chain of our sins&#148;, stretching all the way back to the General Election of 1918&#146;  (Barrington-Ward to A. L. Kennedy, 24 March 1936, News Int. RO, <span class="italic">The Times</span> archive).<br>
<br>The pro-appeasement line of Dawson and Barrington-Ward caused tensions in the <span class="italic">Times</span> office, as the latter admitted&#151;writing in his diary during the 1938 Czech crisis that &#145;most of the office is against Dawson and me&#146;  (MacDonald, 48). Outside it, the line taken by the <span class="italic">Times's</span> leaders could also arouse fierce opposition, so that when the paper urged concessions on the Czech government before Godesberg, Harold Nicolson denounced what in this case he erroneously believed to be the deputy editor's work (to his face), as &#145;a masterpiece of unctuous ambiguity&#146;  (Nicolson, 362).<br>
<br>In later years Barrington-Ward, like Dawson, had to live with the opprobrium directed towards the policy of appeasement advocated by <span class="italic">The Times</span> [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71213', "Cliveden set")</script>], and as a result his wider record was largely forgotten. His leaders on unemployment, for example, resulted in the appointment of a government commission in 1934. After his appointment as editor on 1 October 1941, when Dawson retired, he was a strong supporter of Sir William Beveridge and of the need for wholesale social reform. During his editorship, <span class="italic">The Times</span> moved to the left, and during the war advocated many of the welfare measures subsequently enacted by the Labour government elected in 1945. The condemnation by <span class="italic">The Times</span> of British intervention in Greece in 1944 provoked a stinging response by Winston Churchill in the House of Commons on 18 January 1945. Barrington-Ward noted that the parliamentary cheer which followed Churchill's attack was the &#145;loudest, largest and most vicious&#151;even savage&#151;that I have ever heard in the House&#146;  (Barrington-Ward, diary, 18 Jan 1945). Churchill himself had not forgiven <span class="italic">The Times</span> for its association with appeasement, though it is likely that (as Barrington-Ward believed) many tory MPs were expressing anger at what they perceived as the leftward drift of the paper. Nevertheless Barrington-Ward regarded himself as a tory radical, and not a socialist.<br>
<br>Like Dawson, Barrington-Ward delegated the initial drafting of editorials to others, notably to E. H. Carr, later a distinguished left-orientated historian. The consistent radicalism of his later years, in the direction of the post-war corporatist consensus, hardly substantiates the suggestion that Barrington-Ward's later poor health undermined his judgement. Despite his radicalism he liked to keep in touch with his old roots: he was, for example, involved in the discussions about the succession to his old mentor Garvin at <span class="italic">The Observer</span>.<br>
<br>Barrington-Ward was a governor of Westminster School and wrote a memoir (1924) of his headmaster, James Gow. In 1947 he was made an honorary fellow of Balliol College. His health weakened (from the early effects of Parkinson's disease) at a relatively early age, and he died on 29 February 1948 from cerebral malaria while on a cruise to South Africa designed to help recovery. He was buried in the Kiriondoni cemetery, Dar es Salaam.<br>
