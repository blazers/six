<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas George</span>  (1876&#150;1954), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 13 February 1876 at 32 Colls Road, Peckham, London, the son of Henry William Hill, a paper maker's clerk, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sands. He was educated in London at St Olave's Grammar School and the Royal College of Science before becoming demonstrator in biology at St Thomas's Hospital. He subsequently held various lectureships in botany and biology in the University of London before being appointed in 1912 to a readership in vegetable physiology at University College, London (UCL).<br>
<br>This appointment signalled Hill's establishment in the then rapidly evolving botanical profession. Before the 1870s the principal concerns of British botanists had been taxonomical, expanding with the empire from descriptions of native species to surveys of flora throughout the world. Continental European botanists, especially those working in Germany, had specialized to a greater extent on the internal workings of the plant and by 1900 the importance of their work was increasingly recognized. Hill was one of the first generation of British botanists to incorporate this expanding knowledge of plant physiology into their teaching and research, and a little later he was closely involved with the beginnings of another challenge to traditional botany: the study of plant ecology.<br>
<br>Hill's early work was devoted to the anatomy of plants: with Ethel De Fraine, a London University colleague, he published a series of articles in <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> and <span class="italic">New Phytologist</span> on seedling structure. Even here it was apparent that by the end of the series in 1913 he had moved towards a physiological explanation for variations in the structure of seedlings. F. W. Oliver, the head of the department at UCL, was one of the British pioneers of ecological studies, and Hill took part in the expeditions that Oliver led to Blakeney Point in Norfolk and to France, subsequently publishing papers on the water content of shingle beaches and the osmotic properties of the root hairs of salt marsh plants. When the first meeting of the British Ecological Society was held at UCL in 1913 Hill was a member of its council. At the same time he was also writing about microscopic and biochemical techniques. In 1913 he collaborated with P. Haas on <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Chemistry of Plant Products</span>, later editions of which (the last was published in 1928) included a second volume which covered physiological topics. By this time his research interests also included the metabolism of marine algae. Earlier, in 1915, he had published <span class="italic">Essentials of Illustration</span>, a short guide based on his interest in book illustration and his experience of botanical publishing.<br>
<br>Hill succeeded Oliver as head of the department of botany at UCL in 1929, becoming at the same time professor of plant physiology. Familiarly known to his contemporaries as TG, he was said to hide his essential kindliness under an exterior which was variously described as breezy, awe-inspiring, and gruff; when chairing committees he could be short with those who were verbose. His lectures were remembered as logically constructed and vivid, and those who worked under him found him an effective head of department, in which role he continued until the end of the Second World War, when he was nearly seventy. He lived at Hambledon in Surrey, where he painted, cultivated his garden, and, for many years, helped to run the cricket club. There he was known as Major Hill, a rank to which he was promoted when adjutant to the University of London Officers' Training Corps during the First World War. He remained unmarried and died at St Thomas's Hospital, Hambledon, following an operation, on 25 June 1954. He was buried in Hambledon on 29 June.<br>
