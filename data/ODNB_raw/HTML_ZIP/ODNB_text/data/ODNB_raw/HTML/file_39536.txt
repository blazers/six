</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alcock,  Charles William</span>  (1842&#150;1907), <span class="occ">sports administrator and writer</span>, was born on 2 December 1842 at 10 Norfolk Street, Sunderland, the second child of six sons and three daughters of Charles Alcock (<i>d</i>. 1881), a shipowner and later a shipbroker and insurance broker, and his wife, Elizabeth Alcock, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forster (<i>d</i>. 1890). He was educated at Walter Todd preparatory school in Woodford, and from 1855 to 1859 at Harrow School, following his elder brother, John Forster Alcock. Both were keen footballers and in 1859 the two formed the Forest club. John attended the inaugural meeting of the Football Association (FA) in 1863. In the same year <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> noted that &#145;the play of Mr C. Alcock of the Forest club elicited great applause&#146;. He stood just under 6 feet and weighed 13 stone 6 lb, and he was &#145;an excellent dribbler and goal getter, very hard to knock off the ball, and as hard a worker as he was enthusiastic&#146;. He took a lead in founding the Wanderers in 1863, an Old Harrovian side which replaced Forest and won the FA cup five times between 1872 and 1878. He represented England against Scotland at the Oval in 1870 and captained them in the same fixture in 1875, acting as the cup final referee a week later. As a referee he was reputed to be good-natured and indulgent to offenders, and he was the first president of the Referees Association. &#145;A jovial comrade full of football anecdote&#146;, he also enjoyed athletics and golf, and played cricket for the Gentlemen of Essex. <span class="roman">Wisden</span> (1908) records that he was &#145;a steady bat, a fair change fast bowler, and an excellent long stop&#146; and that he once had &#145;the curious experience of captaining France against Germany at a match in Hamburg&#146;.<br>
<br>However, it is less as a player than as a prodigiously energetic sports administrator and journalist that Alcock is now remembered. He was undoubtedly the most important figure of his time in the shaping of association football and almost as influential in the development of cricket. As the only official with real power in both emergent summer and winter national sports during their formative years, he was the <i>&eacute;minence grise</i> of English sport. He was elected to the committee of the recently formed FA in 1866 at the age of twenty-three, and became its secretary in 1870, a position he held for twenty-five years, the first seventeen of which were unpaid. He was also the president of the Surrey FA, vice-president of the London FA and, in addition to his extensive responsibilities as secretary of Surrey County Cricket Club, he was also chairman of the Richmond Athletic Association and vice-president of Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club.<br>
<br>Alcock's first love was football, which was then just emerging, as he later recalled, from &#145;the rough and semi-barbarous sport&#146; of the previous century. The game was remarkably fortunate in its young advocate, who after scarcely a year in office devised the rules for the FA cup on the basis of the knock-out house competitions he had known at Harrow. He also took a lead in organizing the first unofficial international match between England and Scotland at the Oval in November 1870 and umpired the first official encounter two years later in Glasgow. Although quite badly injured two weeks before the game, he travelled with the team at his own expense &#145;through the night in draughty carriages with hard seats&#146; to attend a goalless draw played at the West of Scotland cricket club at Partick.<br>
<br>The sport prospered mightily. &#145;What was ten or fifteen years ago the recreation of a few has now become the pursuit of thousands&#146;, Alcock observed on receiving a testimonial from the FA committee in April 1881 &#145;in consideration of his having been the founder of the Association game&#146;. Recalling the early opposition to football in the medical journal <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and elsewhere, he moved on with typical directness to the new problems of success, of gate money, professionalism, and the relations between north and south. &#145;The time had arrived to settle the question&#146;, for it was evident in the Lancashire cotton towns that players were being paid and &#145;Scotch professors&#146; imported by teams such as Preston North End, who were suspended by the FA in 1884. The FA committee, mostly staunch public school amateurs, were for a firm line against professionalism. Alcock took a different view: calm, practical, genial, and effective, and drawing on his extensive experience of cricket, he saw the inevitability of the advent of the professional player. Although an amateur himself, he objected to the argument &#145;that it is immoral to work for a living&#146;&#151;even if that work took the form of sport. He twice proposed the legalizing of professionalism under strict controls before it was accepted in July 1885, thus averting a schism of the kind that afflicted rugby ten years later. Professionalism was permitted under strict controls and amateur influence preserved. When in 1888 a professional football league was proposed&#151;almost the only major innovation of the time that was not of his devising&#151;Alcock proved agreeable, his journalistic instinct for the commercial spectacle overcoming his residual amateur scruples. It was thus that the distinctive and durable dual structure of English football was born.<br>
<br>Remarkably, Alcock was just as active in cricket as in football. In 1872, the year of the first cup final and official international, he became secretary of Surrey, a post he held for the rest of his life. During this time the county enjoyed great success, winning eight county championships between 1887 and 1895. Alcock, a shrewd and flexible man, appointed the amateur W. W. Read as assistant secretary to &#145;secure the services of one of the very best cricketers Surrey ever had&#146;. But he also took care to keep the professionals happy, encouraging crowd collections for great performances and introducing innovative &#145;star contracts&#146; for top players such as Tom Hayward, George Lohmann, George Richardson, and Bobby Abel. Generous and pragmatic though he was, he expected deference from professionals and bridled when these four threatened to strike on the eve of the third test against Australia at the Oval in 1896 unless their match fee of &pound;10 was doubled. The players backed down and apologized; Alcock admitted they had a case but rejected what he saw as &#145;a peremptory demand not a request for consideration&#146;. His power within association football ensured that big FA fixtures came to the Oval, providing Surrey with a valuable source of income until 1895, when he supervised the building of a new pavilion and tavern. Completed within six months at a cost of &pound;38,000, these helped to ensure the ground's future as a test venue.<br>
<br>Alcock always had an eye for the great event. Drawing on his experience in promoting international football, he arranged the first test match held in England, against Australia at the Oval in 1880. Two years later, again at the Oval under Alcock, the Australians returned with F. R. Spofforth, whose demolition of England inspired the legend of the Ashes. After the match N. L. Jackson, the founder of the Corinthians, saw Alcock &#145;sitting down on a huge iron safe, burying his head in his hands, oblivious to everything&#146;. His breathless description of the defeat is memorable: &#145;Men who were noted for their coolness at critical moments were trembling like a leaf; some were shivering with cold; some even fainted. At times there was an awful silence&#146;  (W. A. Bettesworth, <span class="italic">Chats on the Cricket Field</span>, 1910, 23). Despite the England team's failure, the general arrangements for test matches were henceforth left in his hands by the MCC.<br>
<br>Alcock witnessed the Ashes test of 1882 as both an official and a journalist. Presumably reliant at first on family money, he soon established himself in the latter role and promoted the better conventions of what was then a new genre of writing. Although tending at times towards hyperbole, he was never crass and always readable. Writing not only supplemented his earnings as an administrator but also gave an outlet to his opinions and his feelings for the sports he loved. For thirty-five years he both made and reported the sporting news, exploiting his exceptional position to the full not just for his own ends&#151;he was comfortably off and left over &pound;3000 without making a large fortune&#151;but also for the unity and prosperity of football and cricket. He began his journalistic career in his twenties, writing for <span class="italic">The Field</span> and <span class="italic">The Sportsman</span> before founding his own specialist magazines including a <span class="italic">Football Annual</span>, a <span class="italic">Football</span> magazine, and in 1882 the weekly <span class="italic">Cricket</span>. This has been described as &#145;the first viable national magazine solely devoted to cricket&#146;  (Sissons) and provided a model for future publications, mixing match reports with gossip and player profiles. Alcock also published several books, including <span class="italic">Football: the Association Game</span> (1890) and, with Viscount Alverstone, one of the first notable works of sports history, <span class="italic">Surrey Cricket: its History and Associations</span> (1902), known at the Oval as &#145;the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>&#146;.<br>
<br>Alcock married, on 19 December 1864, Eliza Caroline (1841&#150;1937), daughter of Francis Webb Ovenden, watercolourist and marine painter. They had two sons and six daughters. He died on 26 February 1907 at his home at 7 Arundel Road, Brighton, and was survived by his wife and two of their daughters. He was buried on 2 March at Norwood cemetery in a plot acquired for his second son, Charles Ernest, who died at five months in 1874. In 1992 the Football Association agreed to adopt the grave of the man who, in the words of their official historian, was &#145;the forgotten father of English sport&#146;.<br>
