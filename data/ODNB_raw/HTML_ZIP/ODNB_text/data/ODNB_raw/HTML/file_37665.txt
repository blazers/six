<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lehzen,  (Johanna Clara) Louise</span>, Baroness Lehzen in the Hanoverian nobility  (1784&#150;1870), <span class="occ">royal governess</span>, was born on 3 October 1784 in Hanover, among the younger of the seven daughters and two sons of Joachim Friedrich Lehzen, a Lutheran pastor, and his wife, Melusine Palm, daughter of a clergyman. Joachim Lehzen had known the disgraced Queen Caroline Matilda of Denmark during her exile in Celle. After serving in the von Marenholtz family, in December 1819 Louise Lehzen came to England to become the governess of Princess Feodore, daughter from her first marriage of the duchess of Kent; earlier in the same year the duchess had given birth to another daughter, who would become Queen Victoria.<br>
<br>In 1824 Lehzen was appointed governess to Victoria, as well as to her half-sister, remaining as lady in attendance and Victoria's constant companion after her education was placed in other hands. From 1830 she held no official position at court, hampered by her lowly social origins, despite the Hanoverian barony which was conferred on her by George IV in 1827. More important was the intense dislike of Sir John Conroy, comptroller of the household of the duchess of Kent. Seeking to establish himself as Victoria's chief counsellor, against the day of her accession, he viewed the baroness as a rival and sought to have her removed from the household. But she was firmly entrenched in Victoria's affections, and, moreover, was regarded by George IV and William IV as a bulwark against the ambitions of Conroy; she retained her position. In Victoria's eyes she was &#145;the <i>most affectionate, devoted, attached</i>, and <i>disinterested</i> friend I have&#146;  (<span class="italic">Girlhood</span>, ed. Esher, 1.138).<br>
<br>After Victoria's accession, Lehzen remained her constant attendant; the duchess of Kent had little access to her daughter, but Lehzen occupied an adjoining bedroom with a connecting door, withdrawing during political audiences and returning immediately afterwards. She also enjoyed considerable control over the queen's expenditure: her signature was required to authorize the payment of all tradesmen's bills. Her influence was criticized, especially by those hostile to German influence at court, as was her penchant for gossip, characteristics which made her a ready scapegoat in the Lady Flora Hastings scandal. More importantly, fear of losing Lehzen was one of the causes of Victoria's intransigence during the &#145;bedchamber&#146; crisis of 1839.<br>
<br>The arrival of Prince Albert in 1840 ended Victoria's dependence on Lehzen. Albert, determined that his wife should rely on him alone, came early into conflict with her attachment to the baroness. By 1842, he was describing her as &#145;A crazy, stupid intriguer, obsessed with the lust of power, who regards herself as a demi-God, and anyone who refuses to recognise her as such is a criminal&#146;  (Hudson, 184), and actively sought to wean Victoria from her dependence on her former governess. In September 1842 Lehzen was persuaded to retire, with an annual pension of &pound;8000. She returned to Germany, settling in B&uuml;ckeburg with her sister (who died three months later). She remained there with her mementos of the queen, whom she saw briefly in 1862, and died there, unmarried, on 9 September 1870. She was buried in the Jetenburger cemetery at B&uuml;ckeburg, where Victoria erected a memorial to her.<br>
<br>Lacking the sophistication to survive in a royal court, and apparently without personal ambition, Lehzen had none the less been a formative influence of Victoria's character. As an educator, she had not imparted a great deal of information to the young princess, but provided a clear set of moral imperatives and encouraged in them the strength of will which had enabled her to foil the plans of Conroy. Perhaps remembering the unfortunate Queen Caroline Matilda, she wrote that she could &#145;pardon <i>wickedness</i> in a Queen, but not <i>weakness</i>&#146;  (Hudson, 19).<br>
