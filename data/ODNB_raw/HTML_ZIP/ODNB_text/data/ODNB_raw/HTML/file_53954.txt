<span class="headword">Beveridge <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Akroyd]</span>,  Annette Susannah</span>  (1842&#150;1929), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born in Mount Street, Stourbridge, Worcestershire, on 13 December 1842, the third child and daughter surviving to adulthood of William Akroyd (<i>d</i>. 1869), a currier, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walford, a daughter of the local livery stable owner. After his wife's death in 1849, Akroyd married Mary Anne Perks; three children of this marriage survived to adulthood. Akroyd, who became a prosperous businessman, was a notably energetic leader in civic affairs, in the Presbyterian&#150;Unitarian chapel and in radical Liberal politics. Annette was deeply attached to him, and he was her lifelong model for uncompromising independence, plain speaking, and doing one's duty.<br>
<br>Unitarianism was a determining influence in Annette Akroyd's life. In January 1861 it brought her to the Unitarian-led Bedford College in London, where she completed a three-year course of study. At the college her commitment to secular and to women's education was reinforced&#151;ignorant middle-class girls were just as needy in this respect as the poor, she once argued, and thus were equally fit subjects for philanthropy. On her father's death in 1869 the Akroyds moved permanently to London, where they were members of James Martineau's Little Portland Street Chapel. Throughout her life she expressed a desire for firmer faith, but seems to have been thwarted in attempts to achieve it by a tough-minded rationalism inherited from her father.<br>
<br>In 1872 Akroyd went to India to start a school for Hindu girls, a mission inspired in part by Keshub Chunder Sen (1838&#150;1884), leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a Hindu reformist sect with historic ties to the Unitarians. In a visit to England in 1870 Sen had urged well-trained Englishwomen to come to India to provide a secular education for Indian women; in October of 1872 Annette Akroyd sailed for Calcutta determined not to be a part of the Anglo-Indian set. Almost immediately, however, she fell out with Sen and his Brahmos, as they were referred to, about the control and curriculum of the school. Their conflict was entangled in internal Brahmo disputes and very quickly she was identified with one Brahmo wing and attacked by the press of the other. By May 1873 she had broken with the Brahmos, continuing to run the school alone until 1875. She was wounded by what she regarded as dishonourable behaviour on the part of the Brahmos, all the more so, perhaps, because the episode ended her social activism. Her perceptions about this experience coloured her sharp public opposition to the <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span> of 1883, legislation which would have expanded the jurisdiction of native Indian judges over Europeans.<br>
<br>On 6 April 1875 Akroyd married Henry Beveridge (1837&#150;1929), a judge in the Indian Civil Service. Between 1877 and 1885 they had two daughters and two sons. Although she has been portrayed as domineering towards her son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31871/', "William Beveridge, Baron Beveridge")</script>, this characterization might legitimately be softened. Certainly she was a dutiful mother: her letters are full of anxiety about arranging for her children's health and education. Given life in the Indian Civil Service, such arrangements were not easy and fell almost exclusively on her.<br>
<br>Her husband's scholarly interests and her own progressive deafness promoted Annette Beveridge's turn to scholarship. It is typical of her steely virtue that she never gave way to physical handicap, but her letters contain a few poignant hints of the social isolation she sometimes felt. Her first translation was made in 1890, from German, of F. A. de Noer's <span class="italic">Emperor Akbar</span>, the preface of which gives a rare glimpse into her idealism about the British empire. After resettling in England in 1890 she began to learn Persian, initially as a distraction from grief: between 1890 and 1893 two of her four children died. Her first oriental translation was of the <span class="italic">Humayun-nama</span> (1902), from Persian. Her best-known translation is of Babur's autobiography, the <span class="italic">Babur-nama</span>. Although this important sixteenth-century classic had previously been translated from Persian into English, she was the first to translate it from the language in which Babur wrote, Chagatai Turkish. The project consumed nearly twenty years of her life because of the research required on fundamental matters, such as establishing the authentic text and knowledge of a language then little known in the West. The <span class="italic">Babur-nama</span> was published in four instalments between 1912 and 1921. Her translation is not felicitous from a literary point of view, but the hallmarks of her work&#151;the most complete of indices, and scrupulous footnotes and appendices on matters of fact&#151;have made it invaluable for later scholars. She died on 29 March 1929 at 26 Porchester Square, Bayswater, London, and was cremated on 2 April. Her husband Henry survived her by seven months. Her surviving son achieved lasting fame as the architect of the welfare state, and her daughter, Jeannette, married the historian R. H. Tawney. A scholarship in her name was established by her husband and children at Bedford College in July 1929.<br>
