<span class="headword">Campbell,  Gordon</span>  (1886&#150;1953), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Upper Norwood, London, on 6 January 1886, ninth son and thirteenth of the sixteen children of Colonel Frederick Campbell and his wife, Emilie, daughter of Donald Maclaine of Lochbuie. Educated at Dulwich College, he passed into the <i>Britannia</i> as a naval cadet in 1900. He was promoted lieutenant in 1907 and at the outbreak of the First World War he was commanding a destroyer on channel escort duties. In 1911 he married Mary Jeanne, daughter of Henry V. S. Davids, of Hillier House, Guildford; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Early in 1915 as part of the anti-submarine measures a number of tramp steamers were converted into decoy ships with naval crews and concealed guns. Campbell volunteered for these &#145;mystery&#146; or Q-ships, and became the most brilliant exponent of this hazardous form of warfare. To outward appearance harmless merchantmen, the Q-ships offered themselves as targets in U-boat infested waters. After their existence became known and enemy submarine captains more wary, Campbell deliberately allowed his vessel to be torpedoed, remaining on board with his hidden gunners, after part of the crew had &#145;abandoned ship&#146;, waiting for the submarine to close her victim. Using these tactics he sank three of the eleven German submarines destroyed by Q-ships. For an action on 17 February 1917 against a German submarine he was awarded the Victoria Cross, which was given to him by the king on 7 March (and gazetted on 21 April). He was also appointed to the DSO with two bars, and attained promotion to captain in 1917 at the early age of thirty-one. He also received the thanks of the war cabinet, was awarded the Croix de Guerre, and appointed chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. More than seventy decorations, including four Victoria Crosses, were awarded to officers and men of the three Q-ships he commanded.<br>
<br>Campbell's last Q-ships action typified his outstanding courage and that of the crews he inspired. On 8 August 1917 his decoy ship <i>Dunraven</i> was attacked with gunfire by a surfaced U-boat which started a fierce fire on board. After torpedoing the <i>Dunraven</i> the submarine continued to shell her while Campbell and his gunners remained at their posts in the burning vessel, with ammunition exploding about them, waiting for the U-boat to come within range, but she finally made off without doing so. Later the <i>Dunraven</i> sank while in tow.<br>
<br>After the loss of the <i>Dunraven</i> Campbell served as flag captain to the commander-in-chief, coast of Ireland patrol, in charge of all anti-submarine operations in the Irish Sea.<br>
<br>After the war Campbell commanded successively the cadet training cruiser <i>Cumberland</i> and the boys' training establishment <i>Impregnable</i>, and subsequently served as captain in charge of Simonstown Dockyard. In 1920, in recognition of his distinguished war service, he was elected a younger brother of Trinity House. His last seagoing appointment was in command of the battle cruiser <i>Tiger</i> from 1925 to 1927. In April 1928 he was retired as rear-admiral, his indifferent medical record since the end of the war undoubtedly contributing to this early retirement. He was promoted vice-admiral on the retired list in 1932.<br>
<br>Campbell then turned to writing and lecturing. His first book, <span class="italic">My Mystery Ships</span> (1928), told the story of his exploits in Q-ships, and he delivered many lectures on the subject in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, proving a fluent and popular speaker. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Number Thirteen</span>, appeared in 1932; between 1933 and 1938 he produced a number of other works, mostly short historical accounts of various sea actions, also adventure stories for boys; and (with I. O. Evans) he published a textbook on flags (1950).<br>
<br>When the National Government was formed to deal with the economic crisis in 1931, Campbell, although not politically minded, decided to stand as a National candidate for Burnley where he sensationally defeated the Labour member Arthur Henderson, former foreign secretary. A staunch supporter of Baldwin and the League of Nations, Campbell was popular with his constituents and spoke often in the house. In the general election of 1935 he stood again as Liberal&#150;National candidate but was defeated by the Labour contender.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War Campbell was specially commissioned by Winston Churchill to requisition and fit out a number of decoy merchantmen with the object of repeating the earlier <i>ruse de guerre</i> of the Q-ships. Although under his direction the vessels were well armed and brilliantly disguised they met with no success, and after a few months the scheme was abandoned. Campbell was then appointed resident naval officer, Padstow, responsible for naval defences in that area. In appearance the traditional bluff, ruddy-faced sailor, he nevertheless continued to be dogged by ill health aggravated by the strain of his Q-ship experiences, and was finally forced to retire from active naval service in 1943. Campbell died at the West Middlesex Hospital, Hounslow, London, on 3 October 1953. He was the uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49552/', "Lorne Maclaine Campbell (1902&#150;1991)")</script>, who was also awarded the Victoria Cross.<br>
