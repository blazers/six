<span class="headword">White,  Robert</span>  (1645&#150;1703), <span class="occ">draughtsman and engraver</span>, was born in London and was apprenticed to David Loggan, whose position as the leading line engraver for the print trade he was to inherit. His earliest print was made in 1666 and his last in 1702. His output was huge, and has never been fully documented; George Vertue's list has several hundred plates, to which more should be added to complete the catalogue.<br>
<br>White's principal activity was as a portrait engraver. He usually engraved these from his own drawings, made from life in black lead on vellum. Many of them survive: thirteen are in the British Museum, and more are in the Huntington Library, California. Among those in the British Museum is a self-portrait made when White was sixteen, which establishes the date of his birth. The drawings are of remarkable quality, and Vertue was particularly impressed by his ability to capture a likeness:<blockquote>He ought to be remembered as a singular artist in his way, having so vast a genius in drawing and engraving a face, and make the picture so like the original &hellip; that perhaps he has not left his equal in Europe behind him. (Vertue, 6.183&#150;4)</blockquote>White also engraved frontispieces, book-plates (one was for Samuel Pepys), almanacs, architectural views, processions, and the occasional semi-popular piece to catch public interest in a topical story. Most of the portraits served as frontispieces for books, and were made on commission from publishers: this explains the number of heads of divines in his output. A small number he published himself at his house in Bloomsbury Market, and these could be large and splendid. Among the finest are a dozen plates, mostly large, made after paintings by Godfrey Kneller. Vertue records that White charged about &pound;4 for a small plate, but up to &pound;30 for a large one, but also says that he died poor. It is difficult to understand how this could have happened as he was obviously very successful. However, White's engraving business must have been affected by the rise of mezzotint, and for a brief period from about 1680 to 1683 he took up mezzotint publishing himself. John Chaloner Smith lists nine such plates, one of which (the countess of Arundel) White scraped himself. He was buried on 26 October 1703 at St Giles-in-the-Fields, and his plates were acquired by the publisher John King. The writing engraver John Sturt (1658&#150;1730) was apprenticed to White in 1674.<br>

<a name="cosubject_29242"></a><span class="headword">George White</span>  (<em>c.</em>1684&#150;1732), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was Robert's son and worked with his father until the latter's death. He was an engraver for some years before, about 1712, taking up mezzotint with much greater success. Vertue (who knew him well and gives much information about him) records that he was able to command 15 or 20 guineas a plate, almost double what anyone had earned before, but was extremely dilatory in finishing them. Smith lists fifty-nine mezzotints by him, many of which he published himself. In later years he worked for Samuel Sympson in the Strand, who took over many plates after White's death.<br>
<br>White introduced a method of etching the plate before mezzotinting it and frequently finished his plates with the burin, which gives them an unusual sharpness of focus. He also made portrait drawings: the early ones were in black lead (six are in the British Museum), the later ones in crayon. Like his father, White lived in Bloomsbury, where he died on 27 May 1732, aged about forty-eight.<br>
