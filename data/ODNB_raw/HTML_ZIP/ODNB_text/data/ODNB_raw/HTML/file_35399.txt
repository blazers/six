<span class="headword">Parsons, Sir  Leonard Gregory</span>  (1879&#150;1950), <span class="occ">paediatrician</span>, was born at Kidderminster, Worcestershire, on 25 November 1879, the son of Theophilus Lessie Parsons and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Timothy Sharpe, a farmer who migrated to the United States. Parsons came of a Worcestershire farming family and was devoted to Wesleyan Methodism. He grew up at Aston in a home in which devout living was inculcated through parental example, education was liberal, and hospitality generous. He attended the King Edward VI Grammar School for five years, where his enthusiasm for chemistry and rugby football were encouraged. In 1896 he entered Mason College, Birmingham, to study zoology; later he turned to medicine, winning many scholarships and acting for a time as a prosector of anatomy. He qualified MB BS (London) in 1905. During his university years he was involved with the Student Christian Movement and missionary activities. He also developed his talent as a shot and a sprinter and played tennis and rugby with great enthusiasm.<br>
<br>In 1908 Parsons married Ethel May (<i>d</i>. 1955), daughter of the Revd Dr John Gregory Mantle, a Wesleyan Methodist minister. He had known her since childhood. They had one son, who also became a paediatrician, and one daughter.<br>
<br>Parsons held junior hospital appointments at Birmingham and London and practised for a few years at Bromsgrove. His habit of self-criticism and inquiry, and an unusual skill with children, diverted him to paediatrics. Postgraduate training at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London, followed by his election to the staff of the Birmingham Children's Hospital as physician to out-patients in 1910, culminated in an active term of service as lecturer in diseases of children and paediatrics at the University of Birmingham. During the First World War Parsons served in Greece and Serbia and was appointed consulting physician to the Serbian army. In 1917 he received the order of St Sava.<br>
<br>During the post-war years Parsons established himself as a kindly, diligent doctor. He was greatly in demand as a consultant and personal attendant to doctors throughout the midlands and his appointment in 1928 as first professor of child health in the University of Birmingham came as no surprise. The following year he was elected subdean of the medical faculty. New buildings and equipment were added to the Children's Hospital as Parsons's fame grew and research workers flocked to his busy clinic. His personal influence in Birmingham was such that by 1930 he was able to gather together representatives from various hospitals, the university, and the city council in an active campaign for the prevention of children's diseases; despite serious interruption with the outbreak of war in 1939 this great project resulted in the opening of the Leonard Parsons infants' block at the Children's Hospital in October 1945 and the establishment of the Institute of Child Health in that year. The outbreak of war also saw Parsons appointed group officer for the Emergency Medical Service in Birmingham. All through these years, too, Parsons served his university and medical school in many capacities. He supported the hospitals centre plan, from which came the fine medical centre at Edgbaston; and he discharged carefully his administrative responsibilities, which were considerable after he was appointed dean of the medical faculty in 1941. Yet he found time for all who sought his advice on medical education, child welfare, or the practice or problems of post-war medicine. He retired from his professorship in 1946.<br>
<br>Parsons was elected FRCP in 1923, he was knighted in 1946 for his work for children during the war, and in 1948 he was elected FRS for investigations into child health and the wasting disorders of children. He lectured widely, served as president of many conferences and scientific associations, and received the honorary fellowship of numerous societies for the study of children's diseases. Parsons was a physician who combined great clinical acumen and original talent for scientific investigation with an eminently practical outlook on everyday affairs. He left his mark on medical affairs in Birmingham, while the medical research conducted in his laboratory brought it an international reputation. By means of painstaking chemical and clinical studies of the blood of children, his team tracked down the origin of a serious type of jaundice in the newborn infant, which he proved to result from excessive destruction of the red corpuscles and the consequent stimulation of production of new blood cells in various regions of the body. A serious wasting disease of infants was shown to set up complicated symptoms because fats and vitamin D are absorbed with difficulty from the intestines. Parsons also added significantly to our knowledge of rickets, which through the emphasis he placed upon environment and diet he did much to prevent and cure. Finally, he brought clarity to paediatrics by stressing the importance of antenatal factors. He saw clearly that deficient diet for, or infection of, the mother might well result in serious disability of the child. By his insistence on the need for quantitative chemical investigation of problems often enough dismissed as peculiar to the child, Parsons greatly helped to raise paediatrics to a high scientific level and opened up hitherto unrealized fields of investigation. Together with Seymour Barling he wrote <span class="italic">Diseases of Infancy and Childhood</span> (1933).<br>
<br>A simple, rather shy man, Parsons had a quick sense of humour and delighted in the company of a wide circle of friends. He was a devout Methodist who read his <span class="roman">Bible</span> morning and evening, neither smoked nor drank alcohol, and attended chapel with great regularity. It was shortly after returning to his home, Hillfield, Wentworth Road, Four Oaks, Warwickshire, from the morning service at the Four Oaks Methodist chapel that he died suddenly from cerebral haemorrhage on 17 December 1950.<br>
