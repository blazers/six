<span class="headword">Kennedy family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1350&#150;1513), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was important in the history of the Gaelic-speaking province of Carrick in south-west Scotland in the later middle ages, and also assumed national prominence in the mid-fifteenth century. The Kennedys, who were clearly of Gaelic origin, entered Carrick in the retinue of Duncan, earl of Carrick, in the late twelfth century. Under Earl Duncan, Kennedys held the office of steward of Carrick. Members of the family also acquired lands and offices elsewhere in western Scotland under the patronage of the Comyns. The head of the family from <i>c</i>.1350 was <a name="cosubject_54243"></a><span class="headword">John Kennedy of Dunure</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1385)<span class="occ"></span>, whose chief property was on the north-west coast of Carrick, a few miles south of Ayr; he also held the lands of Kirkintilloch in the Fleming barony of Lenzie north-east of Glasgow, and was steward of Carrick. Other branches of the family were to be found at Blairquhan, Knockdolian, Dalmorton, and Gyltre at this period. John further acquired the Carrick lands of Cassillis on the River Doon by marriage to or purchase from Marjorie Montgomery, and also the nearby estate of Dalrymple. There is evidence of building work at the castles of Dunure and Cassillis in the fourteenth century which may well be attributable to John's growing wealth and power; he also founded a chapel in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the parish of Maybole in Carrick.<br>
<br>By 1372 John Kennedy had also acquired properties and offices which had belonged to the now extinct line of the earls of Carrick descended from Earl Duncan: armorial bearings, lands in Lennox, and the offices of bailie of Carrick and keeper of Loch Doon Castle as well as headship of the kindred (<i>ceann cinneil</i>, &#145;kenkynnol&#146;) of Carrick. Possibly these acquisitions came about through his marriage to an otherwise unidentified Mary who may have been a female descendant of the Carricks. Moreover, John was succeeded by his son Gilbert, a name which may signal a connection with the Carricks inasmuch as it had also been the name of the father of Earl Duncan, progenitor of the Carrick family, and of many subsequent members of the family. On the other hand, John's acquisition of Carrick offices may simply have reflected his political dominance of the province, apparent for example in the submission to his &#145;captaincy&#146; by the unidentified clan of Muntercasduf (<i>muintir quas Duf</i>, &#145;the household of the servants of Duf&#146;) in the reign of David II.<br>
<br>John Kennedy's successor, <a name="cosubject_54244"></a><span class="headword">Sir Gilbert Kennedy of Dunure</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1408<span class="mult">x</span>29)<span class="occ"></span>, who had been a hostage in England for King David's ransom in 1357, appears to have been twice married, first to Marion Sandilands of Calder and then to Agnes Maxwell of Pollok, but <a name="cosubject_54245"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Kennedy</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1408)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of the second rather than the first marriage, was during his father's lifetime designated as heir to the family's lands and titles, possibly following his marriage to Mary Stewart, a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23714/', "King Robert III")</script>. This marriage established cousinship with the royal house of Stewart which was to be important in the progress of Kennedy fortunes in the fifteenth century. The offspring of the marriage of Gilbert Kennedy and Marion Sandilands were probably later represented by the Kennedys of Coif, Leffnoll, and Carluke, members of which branches of the family maintained claims to the headship of the kindred and other properties until well on in the fifteenth century. Gilbert was still alive when James was killed on 8 November 1408, perhaps by disinherited members of his kindred&#151;in that year he made an indenture with the duke of Albany, the governor of Scotland, under which in return for the latter's consent to an entail of Kennedy lands, Gilbert became the duke's retainer.<br>
<br>James Kennedy left three infant sons, and during their minority, control of the family patrimony seems to have passed into the hands of his four brothers, in particular Alexander of Ardstinchar, who is described as tutor of James's sons in one source. Alexander is said to have been murdered by his brothers, and Thomas of Kirkoswald and Bargany seems thereafter to have become the most powerful, holding the office of bailie of Carrick until at least 1438. The eldest of James Kennedy's three sons, John, was however designated as of Dunure and Cassillis in 1429, suggesting that he had then succeeded to those parts of the family estates at least. But in 1431 John was arrested for treason and subsequently went into exile, possibly as a result of his connections with Archibald, fifth earl of Douglas, who was arrested at the same time. The precise nature of John's treason remains mysterious, as does his ultimate fate.<br>
<br>John Kennedy's troubles do not seem to have affected either his uncle of Bargany, who continued to hold the office of bailie of Carrick as already noted, or his younger brothers, <a name="cosubject_54246"></a><span class="headword">Gilbert Kennedy</span>, first Lord Kennedy  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1407, <em>d.</em> in or after 1479)<span class="occ"></span>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15372/', "James Kennedy (c.1408&#150;1465)")</script>, the latter having already commenced an ecclesiastical career which would lead to the bishopric of St Andrews in 1440 and significant political influence in the 1450s and 1460s. In the mid-1440s, perhaps following John's death in exile, Gilbert Kennedy began to play a much more prominent role in both Carrick and national affairs and, with royal support possibly aimed at establishing a counter to Douglas power in the south-west, established himself as the head of his family with all its lands and offices, including the bailie-ship of Carrick, keepership of Loch Doon Castle, and the kenkynnol. In order to do this he had to overcome opposition from within his own kindred. The keepership of Loch Doon Castle was resigned to him by John Kennedy of Coif in 1450; he received a quitclaim of the kenkynnol and his Kirkintilloch lands from Gibboun (that is, Gilbert) Kennedy of Leffnoll in 1454; and in 1465 he entered upon elaborate agreements for the settlement of feud with the Kennedys of Bargany, involving intermarriage between the two families. The family muniments contain many other indentures, bonds of manrent, and letters of retinue between Gilbert and other Kennedys, indicative of the manoeuvres which the former had to undergo to establish and make good his claim to be head of the kindred.<br>
<br>This gradual consolidation of his position in Carrick may have enabled Gilbert Kennedy to commission further building work at Dunure and Cassillis. He also embarked upon lengthy litigation, only concluded in 1466, to recover from Robert, Lord Fleming, the lands of Kirkintilloch in the Fleming barony of Lenzie. In 1458 he was made a lord of parliament; a mark of continued royal favour, not to mention Bishop Kennedy's influence, it also underlines his new prominence in the south-west following the forfeiture of the Douglases in 1455. Significantly, Gilbert Kennedy was also justiciar of the forfeited Douglas estates in Galloway. Following the death of King James II in 1460, the influence of Gilbert's brother Bishop James of St Andrews reached its zenith as guardian of the minor King James III in 1463&#150;5. Gilbert succeeded to this role upon his brother's death in 1465 (it doubtless helped that as the son of James I's sister he was the young king's closest adult relative), and was also a justiciar and keeper of Stirling Castle in this period. But after the coup by Robert, Lord Boyd, in 1466, he fell from power and was briefly imprisoned in Stirling despite having entered a complex series of bonds of manrent, friendship, and mutual support with Boyd and others in the Boyd camp earlier that year. He continued, however, to attend parliament until 1479, about which time he died. He was twice married: his first wife was Katherine Maxwell, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54289/', "Herbert Maxwell, first Lord Maxwell")</script>; his second was Isabel Ogilvie, daughter of Walter Ogilvie of Lintrathen and widow of Patrick, Lord Glamis. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15395/', "Walter Kennedy")</script>, the poet, was his son by his first wife.<br>
<br>Gilbert Kennedy was succeeded as second Lord Kennedy by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54247"></a><span class="headword">John Kennedy</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1508/9)<span class="occ"></span>, who was four times married. John's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54248"></a><span class="headword">David Kennedy</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1513)<span class="occ"></span>, was made first earl of Cassillis in 1509, perhaps in consequence of his second marriage, which was to Margaret Boyd, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3115/', "Thomas Boyd, earl of Arran")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54141/', "Boyd family")</script>]. His first wife had been Agnes Borthwick, daughter of William, Lord Borthwick. Their eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15367/', "Gilbert Kennedy, second earl of Cassillis")</script>. David, earl of Cassillis, was killed at the battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513.<br>
<br>The Kennedys were a Gaelic kindred who from the thirteenth century onwards extended their activities well beyond, but without losing sight of, the Gaelic milieu whence they came. On the evidence of William Dunbar's poem of <i>c</i>.1500, &#145;The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy&#146; (Walter, the Kennedy in question, was a younger son of Gilbert, first Lord Kennedy), the family still spoke Gaelic as well as Scots, and the Gaelic form of lordship exercised by them, the kenkynnol, was clearly still worth contending over in the fifteenth century; indeed, the claim of &#145;calp&#146; (the chief's entitlement to a gift from those under his protection and maintenance) to which it gave rise was seen as so oppressive as to require parliamentary abolition in 1490. At the same time the leaders of the Kennedy kindred had no difficulty in seeking and exercising power in the non-Gaelic worlds of national and ecclesiastical politics, and do not appear to have seen any contradiction between their Gaelic and their Scottish personas. Members of the family married royalty, became guardians of minor kings, were appointed as bishops and lords of parliament, exercised offices under the crown, and resolved their disputes by litigation, arbitration, and bonds of manrent. The family history is an excellent illustration of the interplay between local and national interests, and the varying traditions, which together constituted the late medieval Scottish noble polity.<br>
