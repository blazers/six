<span class="headword">Paish,  Frank Walter</span>  (1898&#150;1988), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born in Croydon on 15 January 1898, the eldest of five sons (there were no daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66759/', "Sir George Paish (1867&#150;1957)")</script>, joint editor of <span class="italic">The Statist</span> (1900&#150;16) and author of many publications on economic and social problems, and his wife, Emily Mary, daughter of Thomas Whitehead, of Liverpool. He was educated at Winchester College before being commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in 1916. He served in France in 1917&#150;18 with the rank of lieutenant and was awarded the MC (1918) during the German offensive of March 1918, when he was wounded by shrapnel. From 1919 to 1921 he was a student at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a second class (division one) in both part one of the history tripos (1920) and part two of the economics tripos (1921).<br>
<br>On leaving university Paish joined the Standard Bank of South Africa, first in London in 1921 and then, from 1922 to 1932, in South Africa, at Aliwal North, where he was manager of a country branch, and finally in Cape Town, where his responsibility became that of economic intelligence and analysis. In 1927 he married Beatrice Mary (<i>d</i>. 1992), sister of Rachel, who married Sir Bryan Matthews, and daughter of Gustav Conrad Eckhard, shipping agent, of Manchester. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1932 Paish left the bank and was appointed a lecturer at the London School of Economics (LSE). His work for the Standard Bank led him to throw new light on the working of the gold standard and he was one of the first economists to emphasize the role of changes in national income and expenditure, in addition to the quantity of money, in bringing about balance of payments adjustments. Paish was made a reader at the University of London in 1938 and Sir Ernest Cassel professor of economics (with special reference to business finance) in 1949. During this period his publications included <span class="italic">Insurance Funds and their Investment</span> (1934, with George Schwartz) and a study of the cheap money policy of 1932. From 1941 to 1945 he was deputy director of programmes in the Ministry of Aircraft Production. During the war he was also commissioned into the Home Guard, reaching the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Paish was elected president of section F of the British Association in 1953. He held his professorship until retirement in 1965, when he was appointed professor emeritus; and in 1970 he was made an honorary fellow of LSE. Between 1965 and 1970 he acted as consultant to Lloyds Bank on economic affairs. He had neither the training nor the taste for the mathematical theorizing and complex econometric testing which became prevalent in his profession. Instead, he had an unusually shrewd eye for applied economic problems and for the basic statistics needed to throw light on them. He always saw the formulation of economic theory as an art, and he was content to make contributions to the solution of difficult questions by means of a first approximation; econometric refinements he was content to leave to others. He had a rare understanding of the cyclical behaviour of the British economy and had a better forecasting record than most. He was one of the first economists to emphasize the need for a margin of spare capacity (&#145;unused productive potential&#146;) to prevent inflation and the dangers of an ambitious policy of stimulating demand in the hope of stimulating long-term economic growth. In the conditions of the 1960s he argued that the spare capacity needed to prevent inflation would involve a level of unemployment of 2&frac12; per cent, a view which was the subject of hostility on the part of those who believed that economic policy should be less restrained, including trade unionists; although he held policy makers rather than trade unions responsible for inflation and did not believe in the efficacy of &#145;incomes policy&#146;.<br>
<br>Changes in the characteristics of the British economy in the 1970s and 1980s, like those in most other countries, rendered Paish's original estimate of the level of unemployment implied by anti-inflationary policy much too low; and later all economists accepted the need for some margin of spare capacity, even though they might disagree on its precise level and on the role of different instruments of economic policy. In the 1960s Paish's views were unpopular in Whitehall, where his prescriptions were neither sought nor taken. The tension between the supporters of his approach, who included colleagues at LSE, and advocates of more ambitious demand policies, broadly identified with the Keynesian school in general and with economists in Cambridge in particular, made difficult his task as editor of the London and Cambridge Economic Service, which produced regular assessments of economic conditions by economists from LSE and Cambridge. He was its secretary from 1932 to 1941 and again between 1945 and 1949, and editor from 1947 to 1949.<br>
<br>Paish's publications included <span class="italic">The Post-War Financial Problem, and other Essays</span> (1950), <span class="italic">Business Finance</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Studies in an Inflationary Economy</span> (1962), <span class="italic">Long-Term and Short-Term Interest Rates in the United Kingdom</span> (1966), (ed.) <span class="italic">Benham's Economics</span>, fifth to eighth editions (1962&#150;7), and, with A. J. Culyer, the ninth edition (1973), <span class="italic">Rise and Fall of Incomes Policy</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">How the Economy Works, and other Essays</span> (1970).<br>
<br>Paish was of medium height and fair-haired, with strikingly blue eyes. His war wound left him with a limited degree of movement in his right shoulder, which necessitated some unusual but spectacular shots at the table tennis which was an off-duty diversion of the senior common room at LSE. His writing and his teaching had a directness, clarity, and lack of pretentiousness which were characteristic of the man. He had a boyish sense of humour and would reach the heart of a subject by means of brief and pithy comment. He was always ready to help his students and was an amiable colleague; but behind his friendliness and humour there was a robustness and even a hint of steel, which owed something, perhaps, to his experience in the First World War. Paish died at his home, the Old Rectory Cottage, Kentchurch, Hereford, on 23 May 1988.<br>
