<span class="headword">Everard,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1586/7?), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert and author</span>, presented himself in 1610 at the English College, Rome, giving a somewhat confusing account of his life thus far. He was two months short of either his twenty-third or his twenty-fourth birthday, and had been born a younger son at Deene, Northamptonshire. His father, who had died two years previously, a gentleman worth &pound;100 a year, was an &#145;Anglicanus&#146;  (Kenny, 223), but his father's twin sister, Mary Brudenell, was a Catholic, as was their nephew, Richard Everard of Leicester. This suggests that John was the son of Humphrey Everard of Whittington, Staffordshire, an identification strengthened by his reference to an elder brother was a &#145;captain with the heretics in Belgium&#146;; this could be Michael Everard, son of Humphrey, later killed while fighting in the service of the United Provinces, or Edward Everard (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1575). However, John also refers to his mother, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Diggles, who had remarried Richard Smith (<i>d</i>. 1615), rector of Bulwick and canon of Peterborough. This woman appears in other sources as the Elizabeth Diggles, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palladay, who on 8 May 1581 married the rector of Deene, Christopher Everard (<i>d</i>. 1608), a first cousin of Humphrey Everard. Elizabeth and Christopher Everard's second child and eldest son, another John Everard, was born and baptized on 19 April 1584; two sisters and two brother also survived their father, just as John of Rome claimed in his own case.<br>
<br>This is not the limit of confusion over which of the second cousins called John Everard presented himself at Rome. The convert says that, after private education of about eight and a half years, at the age of eleven or twelve, he went to Clare College, Cambridge, where he studied under the principal, Thomas Byng (<i>d</i>. 1599), and after four years graduated and became a fellow. College records reveal one John Everard admitted as a Leeds scholar in 1597, who graduated BA in 1601, and another admitted in 1603; neither seems to have been a fellow, but one proceeded MA in 1607. John of Rome, however, recalled that he had caught the plague in Belgium when he was seventeen, which does not indicate uninterrupted residence in Cambridge. His stay at university was long enough for his reading in the works of Cardinal Bellarmine and Thomas Stapleton to lead him into the Catholic faith. He claimed that, having gone to the English Jesuits' College at St Omer, he was reconciled to the Roman Catholic church by John Floyd, although Everard does not appear in the register there. Under the name Edward Smith, in 1610 he was admitted to the English College at Rome as a probationer, but he left after two or three months because he was afflicted with dizziness in the head during his studies, and because he was unable to agree with his fellow students.<br>
<br>It must have been this John Everard who, following his return to England, published under that name in 1611 <span class="italic">Britanno-Romanus, sive, Angligenarum in Collegio Romano vitae Ratio</span>. A detailed account in Latin of how the college worked, it exhibited hostility to the Jesuits who ran it, and evidently marked Everard's reconversion to protestantism. The later life of the author, and in particular his relationship to the protestant preacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8998/', "John Everard (1584?&#150;1640/41)")</script>, is uncertain.<br>
