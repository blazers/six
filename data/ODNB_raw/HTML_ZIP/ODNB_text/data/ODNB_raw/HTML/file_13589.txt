<span class="headword">Holmes,  Alfred</span>  (1837&#150;1876), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born on 9 November 1837 in London, the son of Thomas Holmes of Lincoln and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sutch. He was given his first, and perhaps only, violin lessons by his father, concentrating on the study of Spohr's <span class="italic">Violin School</span>, followed by the practice of works by Pierre Rode, Pierre Baillot, and Rodolphe Kreutzer. It is reported that this intensive study made him a finished player before he was twenty. In 1847 he was principal boy soprano at the oratory, King William Street in the Strand, and on 13 July of the same year he and his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54666/', "Henry Holmes (1839&#150;1905)")</script>, also taught by his father, and Alfred's apparent equal in talent, gave their d&eacute;but performance at the Haymarket Theatre for Benjamin Webster's benefit in a duet arrangement of the overture to Auber's <span class="italic">Masaniello</span> (<span class="italic">La muette de Portici</span>). In 1852 they played duets by Spohr for the composer when he visited London, and the latter was delighted by their renderings.<br>
<br>However, their formal introduction to the public as violinists was delayed until 5 May 1853, when the brothers appeared at the Beethoven Rooms. Their performance of J. W. Kalliwoda's double concerto and of solos by various composers (including Vieuxtemps's <span class="italic">Fantasie caprice</span>) won high praise. In 1855 they made the first of a series of concert tours on the continent, beginning in Brussels, where they greatly impressed C. A. de B&eacute;riot and Hubert L&eacute;onard. In 1856 they visited Germany, and in Kassel were once again heard by Spohr. His recognition of the outstanding quality of their playing was so thoroughly confirmed that he dedicated to them his three grand duos for two violins, opp. 148, 150, and 153. It is also thought that Spohr's own Guadagnini violin of 1780 was later owned by Alfred and Henry in turn. The brothers went on to visit Vienna (1857), Sweden (1857&#150;9), Denmark (1860), and Norway and Holland (1860&#150;61).<br>
<br>After some successful concerts in Paris in the autumn of 1864 the two men parted. Alfred Holmes settled in Paris and, early in 1866, under the auspices of the ministry of public education, established a series of Sunday fortnightly concerts. The following year he toured through Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and finally, Russia. Perhaps encouraged by Berlioz, Holmes had already decided to devote himself chiefly to composition, and the first performance of his first symphony, <span class="italic">Jeanne d'Arc</span>, was produced in April 1867 at St Petersburg. He then returned to Paris, where this work, scored for solo voices, chorus, and orchestra, was enthusiastically received at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Italien in 1870. Two other symphonies, <span class="italic">The Siege of Paris</span> and <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span>, were given in Paris in the same year. During one of Holmes's occasional visits to London the concert overture <span class="italic">The Cid</span> was performed at the Crystal Palace (21 February 1874), and the first symphony was given at the same venue (27 February 1875). Another symphony, entitled <span class="italic">The Youth of Shakespeare</span>, formed part of the programme at a concert populaire in Paris, though his opera <span class="italic">I&ntilde;ez de Castro</span> (1869, five acts, libretto by Louis Uhlbach) was accepted but never staged at the Grand Op&eacute;ra. Other works include a further two programmatic symphonies, <span class="italic">Charles XII</span> and <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>; a concert overture, <span class="italic">The Muses</span>; and pieces for violin and piano (1857), solo piano, and songs.<br>
<br>Holmes died in Paris on 4 March 1876. A sympathetic notice of him by D. Nisard, a member of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise, appeared in <span class="italic">La Patrie</span> on the 7th of the same month.<br>
