<span class="headword">Kingsmill, Sir  Robert Brice</span>, first baronet  (1730&#150;1805), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second of the two sons of Charles Brice (1683/4&#150;1748) of Castle Chichester, Island Magee, co. Antrim, a captain in the army, and Jane, daughter of William Robinson of Newtownards, co. Down. Robert Brice was made a lieutenant on 29 April 1756, appointed commander of the sloop <i>Swallow</i> in February 1761, and confirmed in the rank on 3 July as a result of his capture of the French privateer <i>Sultan</i> (10 guns). In 1762 he commanded the bomb-vessel <i>Basilisk</i> at Sir George Rodney's capture of Martinique and St Lucia, where he was wounded. On 26 May he was posted to the <i>Crescent</i> (28 guns), and in 1764 returned to England. Some time between 1762 and 1764 he married Elizabeth (1716&#150;1783), only surviving daughter of Hugh Corry of Newtownards, co. Down, and his wife, Frances Kingsmill (1682&#150;1721), of Sydmonton, Hampshire. On the death, on 8 January 1766, of her last surviving maternal uncle, William Kingsmill, a bachelor, Elizabeth Brice succeeded to the Kingsmill estates and her husband assumed the surname Kingsmill by act of parliament.<br>
<br>Kingsmill commanded the <i>Vigilant</i> (64 guns) in the battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. In November of that year Lord Sandwich thought Kingsmill &#145;a good officer but rather discontented and complaining&#146; though he had not &#145;shewn any violence&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 3.12) in the controversy which followed the battle. Yet after the courts martial Kingsmill resigned his command. He sat as the MP for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, between 1779 and 1780, and he considered standing for the county in 1780, but withdrew before the poll. He voted consistently against Lord North's administration and, unsurprisingly, was not employed at sea again until the change of ministry in 1782, when he was appointed to the <i>Elizabeth</i> (74 guns), part of a small squadron ordered to the East Indies. Violent storms in the Bay of Biscay forced the dismasted <i>Elizabeth</i> to return to Portsmouth where she remained as a guardship after the peace in 1783. Kingsmill commanded her until 1786, and the <i>Duke</i> (90 guns) in the Spanish armament of 1790. From 5 April 1784 to 1790 he represented Tregony, Cornwall, in the government interest. Though there is no record of his having spoken in the Commons, Kingsmill voted for Pitt's parliamentary reform bill in 1785, but against Richmond's fortification plans in 1786 and against Pitt in the Regency crisis of 1788/89.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1793 he was promoted rear-admiral of the white and on 31 August he was appointed commander-in-chief on the Irish station. Further promotions were to rear-admiral of the red on 12 April 1794, vice-admiral of the white (4 July), and vice-admiral of the red (1 June 1795). Such rapid promotion perhaps compensated for the difficulties of an admiral who was required, with limited means, to protect the Irish trade and counter the potential threat to Ireland of a French invasion. In 1795 Kingsmill commanded two ships of the line, seven frigates, and four smaller vessels. Such numbers prevented him from confronting French invasion forces at Bantry Bay in December 1796. In the autumn of 1797 his force was increased to between twenty and twenty-five ships, but thereafter it was again reduced to twelve ships.<br>
<br>Kingsmill's post was arduous. In February 1798 he wished to retire but Lord Spencer hoped he would not think &#145;of quitting a situation in which he had been of such essential service&#146;  (Kingsmill MSS, 19M61/4203), and in October that year his ships defeated a French invasion force at Lough Swilly. For this Kingsmill received the freedom and thanks of the cities of Cork, Dublin, Bristol, Liverpool, and London and was made admiral of the blue on 14 February 1799. On 9 September 1800, just before he left Ireland, he gave &#145;a splendid entertainment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, 4.247) for the merchants, mayor, and corporation of the city of Cork. Numerous toasts praised Kingsmill's attention to their interests and his ability and vigilance in protecting trade. Kingsmill struck his flag on 23 November and was created a baronet on 24 November 1800. Having been promoted admiral of the white on 23 April 1804 and admiral of the red on 9 November 1805, he saw no further service and died at his home, Sydmonton House, Hampshire, on 23 November 1805; he was buried at St Mary's, Kingsclere, Hampshire. His brother Edward (<i>d</i>. 1796), principal surveyor of revenue at Belfast, assumed the surname Kingsmill in January 1788. Edward's son, Major Robert Kingsmill (1772&#150;1825), succeeded his uncle as second baronet. On his death the title became extinct.<br>
