<span class="headword">Collier, Sir  Francis Augustus</span>  (1783?&#150;1849), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5915/', "Vice-Admiral Sir George Collier (1738&#150;1795)")</script> and his second wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fryer. He entered the navy in 1794, and after a few years' service in the channel was, early in 1798, at the wish of Nelson, appointed to the <i>Vanguard</i>, Nelson's flagship in the Mediterranean and at the battle of the Nile. He was afterwards moved into the <i>Foudroyant</i>, with Nelson and Sir Edward Berry, and continued serving in the Mediterranean until the peace of Amiens in 1802. He was promoted lieutenant on 11 April 1803, commander on 25 January 1805, and captain on 13 December 1808. In those years he was on routine active service in the West Indies. On 8 December 1815 he was made a CB, and in February 1818 was appointed to the <i>Liverpool</i> (50 guns), going out to the East Indies. In December 1819 he was sent to the Persian Gulf, in naval command of a joint expedition against the &#145;Joasmi pirates&#146;. Recent reinterpretation has suggested that the supposed piracy was a pretext for the destruction of rival traders by the East India Company. The pirates' chief fortress, Ras al-Khaimah, was captured, their fortifications all round the coast were blown up, and their shipping was destroyed; on 8 January 1820 a formal treaty of peace was signed, and piracy, on the part of the Arabs, was declared to be at an end for ever. The treaty was fairly well kept and put an end to national piracy in the area, although other piracy continued.<br>
<br>Collier returned to England in October 1822. From 1826 to 1830 he was commodore on the west coast of Africa. His services in the Persian Gulf had been rewarded by the Persian order of the Lion and Sun; he was knighted on 28 July 1830, and made KCH on 1 January 1833. On 14 March 1831, following the death of his first wife, of whom no details are known, he married Catherine, daughter of Thomas Thistlethwaite of Southwick Park, Hampshire; he had at least one child.<br>
<br>From 1841 to 1846 Collier was superintendent of Woolwich Dockyard, and in 1846 commanded a squadron in the channel. On 9 November 1846 he became a rear-admiral, and in April 1848 was appointed to the command of the China station; he died suddenly of apoplexy at Hong Kong on 28 October 1849.<br>
