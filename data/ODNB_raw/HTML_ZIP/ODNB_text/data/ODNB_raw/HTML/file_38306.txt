<span class="headword">Hanley,  James</span>  (1901&#150;1985), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born in Jervis Street, Dublin, on 3 September 1901, the son of Edward Hanley (<i>d</i>. 1937), a ship's stoker. The Hanleys had ten children, three of whom died in infancy; another of their sons was Gerald Hanley (1916&#150;1992), also a novelist. The father took to the sea after moving his family to Liverpool in 1908 and they lived in Othello Street (now gone) in Kirkdale, near Bootle. The only school Hanley attended was St Alexandra's Roman Catholic primary school, near his home. At the age of twelve he left school and joined the merchant navy, serving in a submarine during the First World War; the reason for his enlisting while under age has never been made clear, except that the family was poor and needed him to start bringing in a wage. Three years later he jumped ship at New Brunswick to enlist in the Canadian Black Watch and eventually saw action in France. Invalided out of the army suffering from the effects of gas, he returned to the sea, working as a stoker on troop carriers, which he featured in some of his novels. He continued to educate himself, mainly by reading Russian literature, and having come ashore in the late 1920s earned a precarious living in a variety of jobs in docks, on the railway, and for a while at Aintree racecourse. Many of his early stories were published in the <span class="italic">Liverpool Echo</span>, the editor of which, E. Hope Prince, became his mentor.<br>
<br>Hanley's first novel, <span class="italic">Drift</span> (1930), and his first volume of stories, <span class="italic">The German Prisoner</span> (1930), were published shortly before his move to Wales, where he settled first at Glan Ceirw, T&#375;-nant, near Corwen in Merioneth, and then, in the autumn of 1941, at Bodynfoel Lodge and Tan-y-ffridd in the village of Llanfechain, Montgomeryshire. He lived from about this time with Dorothy Enid Thomas, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heathcote (1902/3&#150;1980), the woman whom he later married at Hampstead register office in London on 6 October 1947; their son, Liam Powys Hanley, had been born at Corwen in 1933. His second novel, <span class="italic">Boy</span> (1932), an appalling story of sexual violence on board ship, was originally published in an edition of 145 copies for subscribers only. An expurgated trade edition followed, but when in 1934 it was issued in a cheap edition, copies were seized by the police and the book was successfully prosecuted for obscenity. The publisher was fined &pound;400 and copies of the book were burnt. At the International Congress of Writers held in Paris in 1935, which was devoted to &#145;the defence of culture&#146;, E. M. Forster (accompanied by Hanley) delivered a speech entitled &#145;Liberty in England&#146; which criticized the workings of the obscene publications laws with reference to the trial; the speech is included in Forster's collection of essays, <span class="italic">Abinger Harvest</span> (1936). Hanley forbade republication of the novel during his lifetime and it was not reissued until 1990.<br>
<br>The first of Hanley's novels about the Furys, a Liverpool Irish family, appeared in 1935 and a volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">Broken Water</span>, in 1937. On the outbreak of the Second World War he found work with the BBC and later with the Ministry of Information, but his home remained in Llanfechain until 1963, when he and his wife moved to London. During the war he wrote three novels of the sea which are among his best work: <span class="italic">Hollow Sea</span> (1938), <span class="italic">The Ocean</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">Sailor's Song</span> (1943); it was to these that the novelist Henry Green referred in describing Hanley as &#145;far and away the best writer of the sea and seafaring men since Conrad&#146;. He also wrote the autobiographical <span class="italic">No Directions</span> (1943), an evocation of London during the blitz. Many of his stories and radio plays were broadcast on the BBC Third Programme during the 1940s. During his long residence in Wales, Hanley wrote four books with Welsh settings: a collection of essays, <span class="italic">Don Quixote Drowned</span> (1953), and the novels <span class="italic">The Welsh Sonata</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Another World</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">A Kingdom</span> (1978). His <span class="italic">Selected Stories</span> appeared in 1947 and <span class="italic">Collected Stories</span> in 1953. His most memorable achievement is the series of novels about the Furys, which continued with <span class="italic">The Secret Journey</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Our Time is Gone</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Winter Journey</span> (1950), and <span class="italic">An End and a Beginning</span> (1958), all of which are imbued with a sense of the dignity of suffering.<br>
<br>Hanley was a prolific and accomplished writer but, despite the admiration of C. P. Snow, Herbert Read, Edwin Muir, and others, his work has been oddly neglected by literary critics. His output, though uneven, was prodigious: some thirty novels, sixteen volumes of short stories, six plays, numerous scripts for radio and television, and seven volumes of miscellaneous writings, including <span class="italic">Grey Children</span> (1937), a study of conditions in the distressed mining valleys of south Wales during the depression, and books about John Cowper Powys (a neighbour of his at Corwen) and Herman Melville. The reasons for his neglect may have to do with his subject matter: the brutality of life at sea, the wretchedness of his proletarian characters, and the unglamourized portrait of men at war. There is, too, a recurrent theme of violence which some readers have found repugnant. But Hanley, &#145;the well-known proletarian novelist&#146;, as he was described by the poet and editor John Lehmann when his work appeared in the periodical <span class="italic">New Writing</span> during the 1930s, had no interest in idealizing working-class life. Although once a member of the Bootle branch of the Independent Labour Party, he had no time for communism, and in later life was hostile to all political parties. His vision of man as essentially solitary, unable to communicate, and inhabiting a bleak and nightmarish world&#151;though unrelenting to the point of obsession&#151;is sometimes relieved by the quality of his writing, which can border on the poetic, and in his best fiction it is redeemed by the author's charity, humility, and courage. It is a mistake to consider Hanley as only a realist writer: there are touches of surrealism in some of his shorter novels and his main interest is always what is going on in the minds of his characters, especially in their dreams, fantasies, and fears. Some of his characters, such as the indomitable Fanny Fury, are among the most vividly drawn in modern English fiction of the first half of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>James Hanley died of bronchial pneumonia at his home, 11 Clevedon Mansions, Lissenden Gardens, Highgate Road, London, on 11 November 1985 and was buried in the churchyard at Llanfechain, the village which he considered his home.<br>
