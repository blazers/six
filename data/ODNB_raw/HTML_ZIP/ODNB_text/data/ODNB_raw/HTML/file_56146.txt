<span class="headword">M&uuml;ller,  Hugo Heinrich Wilhelm</span>  (1833&#150;1915), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 31 July 1833 at Tirschenreuth, Bavaria, the son of a spinning-mill owner. The family later moved to Weiden, in the Oberfalz, Bavaria. He received his early education at Nuremburg, and in 1850 entered the University of Leipzig, where he attended lectures on chemistry, physics, mineralogy, and geology. In 1852 he moved to G&ouml;ttingen to study under Friedrich W&ouml;hler (1800&#150;1882), and in the same year he published his first mineralogical notice. In 1853 he obtained his doctorate, and in the spring he joined Liebig as assistant in Munich.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1854 M&uuml;ller moved to London, at the suggestion of A. W. Hofmann, to take up the post of private assistant to Warren De la Rue at the De la Rue printing company, based at Bunhill Row. M&uuml;ller's first assignment was the investigation of Burmese naphtha (Rangoon tar). He mixed with a circle of talented chemists, including Friedrich August Kekul&eacute; and, later, Peter Griess, Carl Alexander Martius, and William Henry Perkin. De la Rue and M&uuml;ller published a number of chemical papers together during 1856&#150;62. M&uuml;ller studied coal-tar derivatives, including phenol, which he converted into rosolic acid. The results were published in 1859, in which year he joined the Chemical Society of London. Of major academic interest was his work during the early 1860s on the chlorination of benzene, which, he demonstrated, was enhanced by the presence of small amounts of iodine. This was later applied to other organic compounds. The German chemist Heinrich Caro, employed by Roberts, Dale &amp; Co. of Manchester, supplied M&uuml;ller with mineral pigments and lakes made from the aniline dye mauve, used at De la Rue for printing postage stamps from 1864. M&uuml;ller specialized in the colours, varnishes, and fugitive inks which made the firm's reputation as a leading security printer.<br>
<br>In 1866, M&uuml;ller became a fellow of the Royal Society. He assisted De la Rue with the latter's pioneering work on celestial photography. In 1868, they devised a non-polarizable silver chloride voltaic element of constant electromotive force, and combined 11,000 cells each containing this element, to generate an electromotive force that was not previously considered possible. They carried out a major study of electrical discharges in gases using exhausted tubes, the results of which were published during 1868&#150;83. In 1869, M&uuml;ller acted as an intermediary between the Perkin firm of chemical dyestuffs manufacturers and the German company BASF, both of which had filed similar British patents for the manufacture of synthetic alizarin. M&uuml;ller's contribution to the success of De la Rue led to contracts from the colonies and foreign governments, for which he was rewarded with a directorship. He became an expert in the field of paper making, which led him to the study of compounds present in leaves of various plants (1873&#150;1912). Later, he turned to the species of the genus <i>Primula</i>, and was the first to discover naturally occurring flavone.<br>
<br>M&uuml;ller married Elisabeth Rusel Crosby in 1878, whereupon he assumed British nationality. They took up residence at Park Square East, Regent's Park, London, and in 1885 purchased an estate at Camberley, Surrey, where M&uuml;ller created an outstanding garden. Apart from M&uuml;ller's responsibilities at De la Rue, he acted as foreign secretary of the Chemical Society during 1869&#150;85, and was its president during 1885&#150;7. He was also a member of the convivial B Club of the Chemical Society, and of the chemical section of the British Association. From 1889 to 1915 he was closely connected with the Lawes Agricultural Trust. M&uuml;ller retired from De la Rue in 1902, from which time he worked at the Davy&#150;Faraday Laboratory, attached to the Royal Institution. He was president of the Mineralogical and Crystallographic Society of Great Britain from November 1901 to November 1904. Following the outbreak of war in 1914, he resigned his positions; according to Henry E. Armstrong, this was because of sympathies with Germany. M&uuml;ller died at his home at Crosby Hill, Camberley, on 23 May 1915. His widow and daughter donated &pound;1000 to the Chemical Society research fund and for the triannual Hugo M&uuml;ller lecture.<br>
