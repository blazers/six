<span class="headword">Walden <span class="st"> [Waleden]</span>, Sir  Humphrey</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1330/31), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, probably took his name from Walden in Essex. Nothing is known of his parentage. Recorded as a king's clerk on 8 February 1290, he had earlier entered the service of Eleanor of Castile, perhaps in the late 1270s, acting as her bailiff in several counties, and being entrusted with the administration of her lands after her death. He served Edward I, too, primarily as an administrator of estates; in 1295, for instance, he was the keeper of Stogursey Castle and Cannington hundred in Somerset, from 30 January 1302 to 4 February 1303 he had custody of the see of Worcester, while between 8 June 1306 and 26 March 1307 he was custodian of the archbishopric of Canterbury. Following Edward I's second marriage, to Margaret of France, in 1299, he served the latter as he had served Queen Eleanor, being recorded early in 1305 as keeper of the queen's gold and receiver of the farms and issues of her lands. In 1304 he was an assessor of tallage in Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Hertfordshire, and Essex. Two years later, on 19 October 1306, he was appointed a baron of the exchequer, taking the oath on 7 November following. Walden certainly acted as a baron in the remaining months of Edward I's reign, but equally certainly left that office early in the next reign. There is no evidence that he was disgraced, and his leaving the exchequer should probably be linked to the protection he received on 1 December 1307 to cover an anticipated journey to France with Queen Margaret.<br>
<br>Walden remained in Queen Margaret's service at least until 1314, and he also became the earl of Hereford's steward. Although he was sometimes referred to as a clerk, there is no evidence that he took even minor orders. By 25 March 1310 he had been knighted, and he was appointed to a number of oyer and terminer commissions, most often in Essex. It was probably Margaret's death, on 18 February 1318, that brought Walden back into central government. A household knight in the year 1319&#150;20, his experience as an estate administrator made him increasingly useful to Edward II. On 31 March 1320 he was summoned to attend the king, &#145;to give his counsel upon certain of the king's affairs, whereof the king believes he can be informed by him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1318&#150;1323</span>, 226); less than a month later, on 26 April, Walden was appointed steward of a number of royal estates, for whose revenues he was to account directly to the king's chamber. Four years later, on 8 March 1324, the number of estates was significantly increased, and Walden acquired a colleague. In the meantime he was also involved in the administration of lands forfeited by opponents of Edward II's regime, and was close enough to the king to have heard allegations against supporters of Roger Mortimer in Edward's own presence in 1323. His links with an unpopular government may have had repercussions for Walden, who in July 1322 complained of having been assaulted in both Hertfordshire and Surrey. But they brought him further office, for on 18 June 1324 he was again appointed a baron of the exchequer. His appointment formed part of a scheme for reform of the exchequer involving its division into two departments, northern and southern&#151;Walden worked in the latter. He was active in the exchequer until at least 6 July 1326, but although he was among the justices and exchequer barons summoned to the parliament of January 1327 at which Edward II was deposed, he did not act as a baron thereafter. He did not otherwise suffer from the change of regime, and on 28 March 1330 was appointed a commissioner of oyer and terminer in Essex. He had died by 8 April 1331. Many of his lands, which were concentrated in Essex, were held for life only. There is no evidence that he married; his heir was his nephew, Andrew Walden.<br>
