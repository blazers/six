<span class="headword">Skelton,  William</span>  (1763&#150;1848), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in London on 14 June 1763. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1781 and was a pupil first of James Basire and later of William Sharp. Sir Richard Worsley, bt, and Charles Towneley were among his earliest patrons. He was employed on the illustrations of many of the most sumptuous literary and learned publications of the day, notably John and Josiah Boydell's <span class="italic">Shakspeare</span> (2 vols., 1803); Thomas Macklin's <span class="roman">Bible</span> (7 vols., 1800&#150;16); Bowyer's edition of David Hume's <span class="italic">The History of England</span>; Sir George Staunton's <span class="italic">An Authentic Account of an Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China, Taken Chiefly from the Papers of the Earl of Macartney</span> (1797); <span class="italic">Plates</span>, a large folio volume of maps and illustrations for which Skelton engraved S. Edwards's <span class="italic">The Fire-Backed Pheasant of Java</span> and <span class="italic">The Pelicanus Sinesis, or, Fishing Cormorant of China</span>; <span class="italic">A Description of the Collection of Ancient Marbles in the British Museum</span> (1812&#150;61); and <span class="italic">Specimens of Ancient Sculpture</span> (2 vols., 1809&#150;35), published by the Society of Dilettanti. Skelton is best known, however, for his many fine portraits of famous contemporaries, chiefly from pictures by Sir William Beechey, the majority of which he published himself between 1790 and 1820; these include a series of George III and his sons, which became extremely popular; Robert Markham DD (1790); Thomas Denman MD (1792); Henry, Lord Mulgrave (1808); Spencer Perceval (1813); and Warren Hastings (1817). His <span class="italic">Wenceslaus Hollar</span>, engraved on steel, was published in Horace Walpole's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span>, ed. J. Dallaway (5 vols., 1826&#150;8). One of his latest plates was a portrait of Charlotte Augusta, the daughter of George IV, then the dowager queen of W&uuml;rttemberg, after P. Fischer (1827), which he issued in 1828. He also produced portraits of himself and Beechey in lithography.<br>
<br>Skelton resided for many years at Stafford Place, Pimlico, London, and afterwards in Upper Ebury Street, where he died on 13 August 1848, having long previously retired from the profession. He was buried in Brompton cemetery. He was a man of great benevolence, and for over fifty years served on the committee of the Asylum for Female Orphans at Lambeth. He was married with one daughter.<br>

<a name="cosubject_25663"></a><span class="headword">Joseph John Skelton</span>  (1783&#150;1871), brother of William Skelton, was born in Westminster on 17 June 1783, and became an <span class="occ">engraver</span> in the mixed style of topographical and antiquarian subjects. Before 1819 he went to live in Oxford, where he published <span class="italic">Oxonia antiqua restaurata</span> (1823), <span class="italic">Antiquities of Oxfordshire</span>, from drawings by Frederick Mackenzie (1823), <span class="italic">Pietas Oxoniensis, or, Records of Oxford Founders</span> (1828), and S. R. Meyrick's <span class="italic">Engraved Illustrations of Antient Arms and Armour, from the Collection of Llewelyn Meyrick at Goodrich Court, Herefordshire, after the Drawings and with the Descriptions of Dr Meyrick</span> (2 vols., 1830). He also engraved the heading to the <span class="italic">Oxford Almanack</span> for the years 1815 to 1831, from drawings by Mackenzie and Charles Wild, and executed a set of fifty-six etchings for <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Bristol</span> from original sketches by Hugh O'Neill (1825&#150;[30]). Later Skelton settled in France, where he engraved many of the plates to C. Gavard's <span class="italic">Galeries historiques de Versailles</span> (7 vols., 44, 1839), J. Vatout's <span class="italic">Le ch&acirc;teau d'Eu</span> (1844), and P. A. E. Girault's <span class="italic">Les beaut&eacute;s de la France</span> (1850). He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1825, but his name disappeared from the lists in 1844. He was married to Mary Ann (<i>b</i>. 1784/5), also an artist, with whom he had a daughter, born in Oxford about 1822. By 1851 they were living in London. Widowed, he made applications to the Royal Literary Fund for financial support and, in 1858, through the support of many of his former patrons, he was nominated to a brothership of the Charterhouse, London. He died there, of chronic bronchitis and exhaustion, on 25 March 1871.<br>
