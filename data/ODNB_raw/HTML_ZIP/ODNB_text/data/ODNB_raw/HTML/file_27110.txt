<span class="headword">Temple,  Henry</span>, first Viscount Palmerston  (1676&#150;1757), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 26 August 1676, according to the entry in his father's account book. He was the second but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27115/', "Sir John Temple (1632&#150;1705)")</script>, speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1708), the daughter of Sir Abraham Yarner, muster-master general of Ireland. On 21 September 1680, when he was four years old, he was appointed, jointly with Luke King, chief remembrancer of the court of exchequer in Ireland. Later, on King's death, the grant was renewed to Temple and his son Henry for life (6 June 1716); it was then worth nearly &pound;2000 per annum.<br>
<br>About 1689 Temple entered Eton College, and in 1693 he progressed to King's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated as a fellow-commoner that Easter. He married, probably on 10 June 1703, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1735), the daughter of Abraham Houblon, a founding director of the Bank of England. The couple had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>As the principal representative of the Irish Temples, Henry Temple was created an Irish peer as Baron Temple and Viscount Palmerston on 12 March 1723. A supporter of the Walpole administration and its successors, he was successively MP for East Grinstead, Sussex, from 1727 to 1734, for Bossiney, Cornwall, from 1734 to 1741, and for Weobly, Herefordshire, from 1741 to 1747. Palmerston did not hold formal office other than his Irish sinecure, but in 1730 was among the members of parliament whom Walpole consulted during the debates on Dunkirk, when the ministry's majority was threatened, and in 1734, on the government's behalf, he offered Dr William Webster a crown pension of &pound;300 per annum if he would turn the <span class="italic">Weekly Miscellany</span> into a ministerial paper. Sir Charles Hanbury Williams wrote several skits upon &#145;Little Broadbottom Palmerston&#146;, while William Oliver, in his <span class="italic">Practical Essay on Warm Bathing</span> (1751), claimed Palmerston's cure at Bath in 1736 of a severe illness as proof of the efficacy of the water.<br>
<br>Over two years after the death of his first wife, Palmerston remarried, on 11 May 1738. His new wife was Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1762), the widow of Sir John Fryer, bt, and the daughter of Sir Francis Gerard, bt. There were no children from the marriage. Palmerston's eldest son and heir, Henry (<i>c</i>.1704&#150;1740), was by this time himself widowed, having married Elizabeth Lee on 18 June 1735. Elizabeth had died at Montpellier in October 1736. She was the stepdaughter of the poet Edward Young, and the couple were probably alluded to as Philander and Narcissa in Young's &#145;Night Thoughts&#146; (1742). The younger Henry Temple died on 18 August 1740, leaving a son, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27111/', "Henry Temple (1739&#150;1802)")</script>, by his second wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1789), the daughter of Sir John Barnard. This Henry Temple was father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27112/', "Henry Temple, third Viscount Palmerston")</script>, the prime minister.<br>
<br>Palmerston displayed the common interest of his aristocratic generation in cultural affairs. With regard to his own property, he added the garden front to his house at East Sheen, and greatly improved the mansion of Broadlands, near Romsey, Hampshire. The volume of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1736) by Stephen Duck includes &#145;A Journey to Marlborough, Bath&#146;, inscribed to Palmerston. Part of the poem describes a feast given by the peer annually on 30 June to the threshers of the village of Charlton, between Pewsey and Amesbury, Wiltshire, in honour of Duck, a native of that place. Palmerston's bequest of a piece of land continued to help support the dinner.<br>
<br>Among his other activities, Palmerston was a correspondent of the duchess of Marlborough, and some angry letters passed between him and Swift in January 1726, as Swift resented the treatment he and his friends had received from the Temple family. He helped Bishop Berkeley in his scheme concerning the island of St Kitts, and he presented to Eton College in 1750 four large volumes on heraldry, which had been painted for Henry VIII by John Tirol. He died at Chelsea on 10 June 1757, and was succeeded by his grandson Henry.<br>
