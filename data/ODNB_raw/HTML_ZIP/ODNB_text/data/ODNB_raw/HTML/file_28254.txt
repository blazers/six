<span class="headword">Vescy,  John  de</span>  (1244&#150;1289), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the eldest son of William de Vescy (<i>d</i>. 1253) and his second wife, Agnes, daughter of William de Ferrers, and the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28255/', "William de Vescy")</script>. According to the chronicler of Malton Priory, he was born on 18 July 1244. In 1253, on the death of his father in Gascony, he succeeded to the barony of Alnwick, Northumberland, besides Malton and considerable estates in Yorkshire. Henry III conferred his wardship and marriage on Peter of Savoy, Queen Eleanor's uncle, as a clear grant worth &pound;625 p.a. According to the close rolls (1254), young Vescy was educated, with the Lord Edmund and Henry de Lacy, in the queen's household. Queen Eleanor and Peter of Savoy subsequently married him to their kinswoman Agnes of Saluzzo (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1265). From May 1263 Vescy was (according to the chronicler Thomas Wykes) one of the noble &#145;boys&#146; rebelling under the leadership of Simon de Montfort. His motives were unclear: Henry III had been personally kind to him, with several gifts to him and his mother. His Savoyard wife was devoted to him. Presumably Vescy was attracted by existing friendships with other rebellious royal wards, for instance Henry Hastings and Geoffrey de Lucy.<br>
<br>Vescy's main activity during the barons' war was fighting the king's supporters in the north. From October 1263 until the middle of 1264 he harassed the sheriff of Yorkshire. In December 1263 he was one of those barons listed as supporting the Montfortians' case at the mise of Amiens. However, it is not certain that he fought at Lewes, and he held no office under Montfort. He was summoned to Montfort's famous Model Parliament of 20 January 1265, which he may have attended (although he was still in the north on 9 January). He was due to attend the Dunstable tournament on 24 February 1265, and it is only from then that he seems to have been at court; he received grants in April and May. He was wounded and taken prisoner at Evesham, but was released and compounded for his estates after the dictum of Kenilworth. He may even have been saddled with a double fine. There is a Northumbrian legend that he took home with him to Alnwick, in bizarre northern fashion, one of Montfort's feet, which until the dissolution was preserved in the priory, shod with a silver shoe.<br>
<br>In 1267 Vescy rebelled again with some disinherited northern barons. However, early in the year Edward himself went north and forced him to submit, after taking Alnwick Castle by storm with the assistance of the men of Bamburgh. According to Wykes, the king's son treated him so leniently that ever after he was his devoted friend. Vescy was quickly reconciled, securing pardons for at least three retainers, and ransoming his lands from the count of St Pol for 3700 marks, most of which had been paid by Easter 1270. Unusually for ex-Montfortians he took the cross and attended Edward on crusade to Palestine, financed by the lease of manors and loans [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94804', "Lord Edward's crusade")</script>]. The story that he helped lead Eleanor of Castile out when Edward was operated upon for his famous wound is now thought apocryphal, but he was growing in favour, and accompanied Edward to Gascony on his return to England.<br>
<br>From 1274 to 1276 Edward I made Vescy governor of Scarborough Castle. In 1275 he fought in the Scottish expedition which defeated Godred, king of Man. In early 1276 he went on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela but returned to attend parliament at the end of the year. He was now a trusted member of Edward I's inner circle (although the old tradition that he was the king's &#145;secretary&#146; stems from a mistranslation). In August 1277 Vescy served in Wales and with Otho de Grandson led the substantial naval force which cut off Anglesey and helped bring Llywelyn of Wales to heel. In 1278 he was one of the ambassadors negotiating the marriage of the king's infant daughter, Margaret, to the duke of Brabant. In the following year, he adjudicated disputes between the king of Scots and the bishop of Durham. Vescy was sent in February 1282 with Antony (I) Bek to Aragon for the preliminary negotiations (ultimately unsuccessful) of a marriage between Alfonso, son of King Peter, and Edward's eldest daughter, Eleanor, and in August signed the contract as proxy at Huesca. Bek and Vescy then helped recruit Gascons for the renewed Welsh war. During that campaign Vescy again held the most important command of Anglesey with Otho de Grandson. In June 1285 he was sent with two others to negotiate the marriage between Edward's daughter, Elizabeth, and the son of the count of Holland. He accompanied Edward to Gascony from 1286 to 1289 and in 1287 assisted in the trial and dismissal of the seneschal, Jean de Grailly. Later in that year he again took part in negotiations with the king of Castile; he acted for a short while as Edward's hostage, and was treated with honour by the Castilians.<br>
<br>Vescy was married twice: first to Peter of Savoy's kinswoman Agnes, sister of Alice, countess of Lincoln, and daughter of Manfred III, marquess of Saluzzo. She died, presumably just after the battle of Evesham, for the Alnwick chronicler noted that it was &#145;of grief on hearing of the imprisonment of her lord&#146;  (Hartshorne, 2.5). She was buried with her sister at the Blackfriars, Pontefract. It must be significant that Vescy did not remarry for fourteen years. His second wife, whom he married in 1279 or 1280, was Isabel, sister of Henry de Beaumont (later earl of Buchan and lord of Man) and Louis de Beaumont (afterwards bishop of Durham). Vescy bargained with Queen Eleanor, his wife's kinswoman, to pay her &pound;550 if the lady died childless. (Vescy's alleged marriage of 3 January 1279 to Marie de Lusignan, sister of Hugh XIII, count of La Marche, was merely an abortive prenuptial contract.)<br>
<br>Vescy patronized his family's foundation at Alnwick; additionally, in October 1286, he received a papal faculty to purchase the Friary of Penitence at Newcastle and founded there a house of the Sisters of St Clare. In the same year, he was granted an indult as &#145;a knight of the king&#146; to have a portable altar for his household. Vescy died aged forty-four, childless, on 10 February 1289 at Montpellier, according to the Alnwick Abbey chronicler; he was buried at Alnwick Abbey, but his heart, as a mark of royal favour, was buried in 1290 with the hearts of Queen Eleanor and Prince Alfonso, in Blackfriars Church, London. His brother William succeeded to his estates. His widow was a prominent favourite of Edward II, and was specially banished by the ordinances of 1311, although she soon returned. She died just before 1 November 1334.<br>
