<span class="headword">Yerburgh,  Robert Armstrong</span>  (1853&#150;1916), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 17 January 1853 at Sleaford, Lincolnshire, the third son of Richard Yerburgh (1817&#150;1886), vicar of New Sleaford, and his first wife, Susan, daughter of John Higgin of Greenfield, Lancaster. The Yerburgh family had been settled in Lincolnshire since before the Norman conquest. Yerburgh was educated at Rossall and Harrow schools and at University College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1877. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1880 and subsequently joined the northern circuit. On 8 August 1888 he married Elma Amy Thwaites at St Barnabas, Kensington. She was the only child of Daniel Thwaites of Woodfold Park, Blackburn, a former MP. There were two sons of the marriage.<br>
<br>Yerburgh was adopted as Unionist candidate for Chester in 1885, having been Conservative candidate for Grimsby for two years. At the general election of 1885 he lost by 300 votes to the radical candidate, Dr Walter Foster, but narrowly won the seat in 1886. He was returned again at the elections of 1892, 1895, and 1900, but narrowly lost to the industrialist Alfred Mond in 1906. He regained Chester at the general election of January 1910, retaining the seat until his retirement in 1916. In 1885&#150;6 he was private secretary to the patronage secretary, the Rt Hon. A. Akers-Douglas, and in 1887 was assistant private secretary to W. H. Smith, then first lord of the Treasury.<br>
<br>A man of keen intellect, judicial temperament, and a charming manner, Yerburgh was widely respected as more than a mere party politician. He had many interests, especially imperial defence, agricultural organization, and the promotion of co-operative and co-partnership schemes. As president of the Navy League from 1900 until his death, he keenly promoted naval interests and reforms in naval administration. His strong belief in British naval supremacy was seen to be vindicated when war broke out in 1914. He was also an early advocate of national service and was a member of the council of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95555', "National Service League")</script>, which promoted universal naval or military training.<br>
<br>Yerburgh's deep love of rural life was reflected in his wide interest in agriculture. In 1901 he founded the Agricultural Organisation Society, of which he was president until his death. He was also a vice-president of the central chamber of agriculture and of the English Beet Sugar Pioneer Association, and a member of the Scottish chamber of agriculture. His work for the regeneration of English agriculture led a contemporary, P. J. Hannon, secretary of the Navy League, to describe him as &#145;the father and the founder of agricultural organisation in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chester Courant</span>).<br>
<br>As president of the Urban Co-operative Banks Association, Yerburgh helped to promote co-operative credit societies for the working classes. He supported many other social and philanthropic movements, including the Recreation Evening Schools Association, the National Home Reading Union, and the National League for Physical Education and Improvement. He was also a deputy lieutenant, justice of the peace, and county councillor for Lancashire, and a justice of the peace for Kirkcudbrightshire.<br>
<br>Yerburgh's last years were clouded by failing health, which forced his retirement from parliament in February 1916. He died from heart failure at his London home, 25 Kensington Gore, on 18 December 1916. His funeral took place on 21 December 1916 at Sleaford, where he was buried in the local cemetery.<br>
