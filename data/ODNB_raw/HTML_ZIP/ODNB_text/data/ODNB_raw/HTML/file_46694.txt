<span class="headword">Holmes,  Edmond Gore Alexander</span>  (1850&#150;1936), <span class="occ">inspector of schools</span>, was born at Moycashel, co. Westmeath, Ireland, on 17 July 1850, the fourth son of Robert Holmes (1803&#150;1870) and his wife, Jane, daughter of William Henn, a master in chancery, of Dublin. He had four brothers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33957/', "T. R. E. Holmes")</script>, and two sisters. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London (1863&#150;8), and at St John's College, Oxford (1869&#150;74), where he gained first classes in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i>. He taught for a short time at Repton and Wellington before becoming tutor to the family of the eleventh earl of Winchilsea. A Conservative politician, Winchilsea was responsible for advancing Holmes's claim for an inspectorship after the return of the Disraeli government in 1874. Holmes was appointed as one of her majesty's inspectors of schools the following year at the age of twenty-four. He served in the West Riding of Yorkshire (1875&#150;9), Kent (1879&#150;97), Oxford (1897&#150;1903), and Northumberland (1903&#150;5). Touring the elementary schools of his districts, he observed and noted the effects of the &#145;payment by results&#146; system on both teachers and pupils. The system led to the undue concentration on the &#145;three Rs&#146;; mechanical methods were employed and the curriculum was largely confined to &#145;paying&#146; subjects. As he wrote in his general report for 1878&#150;9, &#145;I do not reproach them [the teachers] for this defect. I only wonder that it is not more striking and more disastrous than it is. Circumstances are against the teacher from first to last.&#146; Holmes believed that it was through the teaching of English, especially literature and poetry, that the emotions could be cultivated and the child's imagination stimulated.<br>
<br>In 1880 Holmes married Florence Mary, daughter of Captain P. M. Syme RA. They had two daughters and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63809/', "Maurice Gerald Holmes")</script>, who entered the Board of Education in 1909 and was permanent secretary from 1937 to 1945.<br>
<br>When Holmes was appointed chief inspector of elementary schools in 1905, he had thirty years' experience of inspecting. In that year, the Board of Education issued a volume entitled <span class="italic">Suggestions for the Use of Teachers and Others Concerned with the Work of Elementary Schools</span> (later retitled <span class="italic">Handbook of Suggestions for Teachers</span>), which encouraged teachers to apply the teaching methods that were most suitable to the needs of their school. He had been largely involved in the final form of the <span class="italic">Handbook</span>. In the course of one of his many visits to elementary schools, in 1907 he discovered a school at Sompting, Sussex, which was a living embodiment of his philosophy. The headmistress, Harriet Finlay-Johnson, whom he called his &#145;Egeria&#146;, had created an atmosphere in which the children were engaged in all forms of self-expression through an imaginative approach that included respect for each individual.<br>
<br>On his retirement in November 1910, Holmes published <span class="italic">What is and What Might Be</span> (1911), a condemnation of the existing education system, which stressed competition rather than co-operation, emphasized visible results, and demanded the mechanical obedience of the child. The book attracted wide public attention. In 1912 he spent some time in Rome visiting the infant schools of Maria Montessori, an account of which was published by the Board of Education. Shortly before his retirement, he became involved in the furore over the so-called &#145;Holmes&#150;Morant circular&#146;, a highly confidential memorandum which he had issued in January 1910 to inspectors, criticizing the quality of the local inspectorate. Its disclosure in parliament in March 1911 led to changes in office of the permanent secretary of the board, Robert Morant, and the president, Walter Runciman.<br>
<br>Holmes was influenced by the idealist philosophy of T. H. Green, though differing from it in some aspects. He wrote extensively on education, philosophy, and religion, and was also a poet. He had become interested in theosophy in his youth and, inspired by the work of Madame Blavatsky, became president of the Quest Society in 1921. But his main interest was in education. He arranged a large conference for educational progressives with the Montessorian Society in 1914 at East Runton, Norfolk. Out of this grew the New Education Fellowship which became a world-wide movement. He died at 108 Cromwell Road, London, on 14 October 1936.<br>
