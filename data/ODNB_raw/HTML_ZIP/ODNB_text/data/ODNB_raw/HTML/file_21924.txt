<span class="headword">Percy,  Algernon</span>, fourth duke of Northumberland  (1792&#150;1865), <span class="occ">landowner and philanthropist</span>, was born at Syon House, Middlesex, on 15 December 1792, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21944/', "Hugh Percy, second duke of Northumberland (1742&#150;1817)")</script>, and his second wife, Frances Julia (1752&#150;1820), third daughter of Peter Burrell of Beckenham, Kent. As a second son in wartime formal education was dispensed with, and he joined the navy at the age of twelve (3 May 1805), serving as midshipman in a succession of frigates in the Mediterranean in Admiral Collingwood's fleet and taking part in the bungled action off Toulon in 1808. Made lieutenant in 1811, he was promoted to commander in 1814, and in the last year of the war was acting captain of the <i>Caledonia</i>, Lord Exmouth's flagship. His naval career ended in 1815, when he was only twenty-three, and he went on half pay and did not see active service again; but on the reserve list he became rear-admiral in 1850, vice-admiral in 1857, and admiral in 1862. Although subsequently credited with a distinguished naval career  (Burke, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>), it seems likely that this was a sycophantic piece of flattery, and that his elevation to the peerage as Baron Prudhoe in 1816 owed more to his father's wealth and position (he was one of the regent's set) than to his own achievements.<br>
<br>Prudhoe took his seat in the Lords but seldom spoke, and indeed was seldom in the country, his political career, such as it was, coming only some time after his succession to the dukedom in 1847. In the 1820s and 1830s he travelled extensively in Africa, being one of the early English aristocratic explorers of ancient Egypt, bringing back a collection of over 2000 objects, later housed in Alnwick Castle, while in 1834 he helped to finance, and accompanied, the astronomer Sir John Herschel's expedition to Cape Town to observe the southern constellations. This gained him an honorary DCL from Oxford in 1841, and his continuing interest in astronomy led him to meet the costs of the publication, in 1847, of the results of Herschel's Cape observations of double stars and nebulae. A larger commitment to scholarship grew out of his friendship with Edward William Lane, whom he first met in Cairo in 1826, and whose return to Egypt in 1842 to collect materials for his Arabic lexicon was both suggested by, and financed by, Prudhoe; he supported Lane and his work for the next twenty-three years, and the first volume of Lane's <span class="italic">Lexicon</span>, published in 1863, was dedicated to the duke, &#145;the originator of this work, and its constant and main supporter&#146;  (Lane, 1.ii). In recognition of the importance of his contributions as patron of science and learning he was elected FRS, FSA, and FRGS. After the duke's death his widow continued this patronage of the <span class="italic">Lexicon</span>, the final volume appearing in 1892, sixteen years after Lane's own death.<br>
<br>On 25 August 1842 Prudhoe married the 21-year-old Lady Eleanor Grosvenor (1820&#150;1911), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11670/', "Richard Grosvenor, second marquess of Westminster")</script>, whom Peel described as &#145;homely enough looking, and very short&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). It might be thought that marriage into the Grosvenor family would have whiggish effects, but in the event Prudhoe's one venture into high politics was in the high tory interest when (as duke of Northumberland) he accepted office in Derby's 1852 &#145;Who? Who?&#146; ministry as first lord of the Admiralty, although the duke regarded himself as a non-party naval person, and Victoria had remarked of the previous year's abortive negotiations with Derby that &#145;The Duke of Northumberland was the only person not properly belonging to the Protection Party who had accepted office&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 2.369). He held office for only ten months and it was an unhappy experience, as he found himself falsely accused by his own parliamentary secretary, Augustus Stafford, of abusing Admiralty patronage by making a key appointment on merit and not on the customary party grounds, when in fact the duke had believed he was appointing &#145;a sure Tory&#151;otherwise Captain Lushington is not an officer I should have appointed&#146;  (R. Blake, <span class="italic">Disraeli</span>, 1966, 321). Stafford was zealous in trying to mobilize as much government patronage as possible in the tory interest, and tried to revive party use of dockyard jobs, discontinued in 1849, and his &#145;electioneering imprudences compromised [the duke] to some extent: he thought his colleagues less forward than they might have been to take up his defence &hellip; and on the making up [<i>sic</i>; perhaps breaking up?] of Lord Derby's government he withdrew from practical politics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disraeli, Derby and the Conservative Party</span>, 227). In the meantime, as a sailor intent on promoting the interests of the Royal Navy and in particular increasing its steam power, the duke had done his bit to bring down the Derby government by insisting on raising the Admiralty estimate by &pound;800,000, thus blowing a hole in Disraeli's already rickety budget  (ibid., 87).<br>
<br>As a young man Lord Prudhoe, it was said, &#145;was of a playful disposition &hellip; He was tall and fair and wore his hat just a little bit on one side&#146;  (Locker-Lampson, 84). If that was so he put childish things behind him on succeeding to the dukedom in February 1847, on his elder brother's death, and quickly assumed, at least in public, the solemn and earnest demeanour of one who took the moral and social responsibilities of his position as Northumberland's chief landowner very seriously. Already in 1852 ministerial colleagues called him the Doge, and although there was a touch of malice in this he was definitely conscious of his own dignity. The Percys were accustomed to being treated as the uncrowned kings of Northumberland, and Algernon the Good, as he came to be called, earned this position by his good works and not simply by his possessions and lineage. He was in the happy position of having a large and growing income from coal royalties, as well as vast landed estates, and his 191,000 acres and income of over &pound;150,000 placed him among the half dozen wealthiest aristocrats of the time. He and his wife had no children to provide for, and without any family constraints on his expenditure he was free to indulge his plans for improvements and embellishments of his inheritance. The detailed application of his ideas for improving the agricultural estate, chiefly by field drainage and by providing modern farm buildings, was the work of Hugh Taylor, previously the estate's colliery agent, whom the duke at once made into the chief commissioner in sole charge of managing the estate. The enabling force, which supplied well over &pound;0.5 million for investment in these things and in cottage building, was the duke's own will, while the more bizarre manifestations of faith in new technologies, such as the creation of the post of his grace's manager of the steam plough and the experiments with raw sewage irrigation through a grid of cast iron pipes, were pure ducal whim. His personal contribution to the welfare of his tenants and workers was most directly expressed in his benefactions, which included ten new churches, as many new schools, half a dozen new vicarages, and a number of new model self-righting lifeboats, the design of which he sponsored. His liberality and hospitality at great dinners for his chief tenants, and even larger but less lavish dinners for their labourers, earned him the genuine affection of many Northumbrians, and at the national level his charitable activities made him president of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Westminster and Middlesex hospitals, the Seamen's Hospital Society, the Westminster General Dispensary, the Royal Institution, and the Royal United Service Institution, and vice-president of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Naval Benevolent Society.<br>
<br>Of all his works, however, the duke was proudest of the vastly expensive &#145;restoration&#146; and embellishment of Alnwick Castle, carried out to the designs of Anthony Salvin, the foremost castle architect of the day, at a cost of &pound;320,000. Completed in the last year of his life this enterprise recreated a romantic medieval border fortress which was habitable, tolerably comfortable, and supplied with modern hydraulically powered gadgetry in kitchens and dining rooms. Viewed in the long term this piece of feudal extravagance probably created the Percy family's most valuable and enduring asset. The duke and his duchess, although they gave convincing performances of their feudal role when at Alnwick, preferred living in the original Smithson family seat in the North Riding, Stanwick Hall, where they could keep &#145;less state&#146;, or better still staying in Kielder Castle on the north Tyne, &#145;where he and the Duchess pass a couple of months with never more than two friends, the house being so small that the dinner-room is also the sitting-room&#146;  (Ticknor, 307). It was, however, at Alnwick that the duke died on 12 February 1865, lying in state in the castle for two days while the tenantry and local notables filed past, then going by special train to London for another lying in state in Northumberland House, where admission was by ticket only for the 5000 who attended, before burial in the Percy chapel of Westminster Abbey on 25 February. He was succeeded by his first cousin, the second earl of Beverley. The dowager duchess, Eleanor, was provided with Stanwick Hall and its 5000 acre estate, and lived there until she died in 1911.<br>
