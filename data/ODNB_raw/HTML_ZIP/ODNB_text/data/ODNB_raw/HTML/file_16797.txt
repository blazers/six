<span class="headword">Livesay <span class="st"> [Livesey]</span>, Sir  Michael</span>, first baronet  (1614&#150;1665?), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was the only surviving son of Gabriel Livesay (<i>d</i>. 1622) of Hollingborne, Kent, and his second wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Michael Sondes, of Throwley. Although often portrayed as an upstart family, the Livesays were in fact established members of the gentry. Sir Michael's grandfather had been sheriff of Surrey, and although his father was the first member of the family to settle in Kent he soon established himself as a figure of influence in the community, and served as sheriff in 1618. Their status was reflected in the baronetcy granted to Michael Livesay in 1627, by which time he was settled at Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey. By 1637 he was a justice of the peace, and in 1640 he emerged as one of the most prominent puritan firebrands in the county. He presented information against recusants to the Long Parliament in November 1640, and was one of the ringleaders of the Kentish petition of grievances in February 1642. In November 1642 he was one of only two Kentish parliamentarians excluded from pardon by Charles I.<br>
<br>During the first civil war Livesay commanded a Kentish regiment, and in addition to fighting throughout the southern counties he was active against malignants in his own county, an enthusiastic member of the county committee, and sheriff in 1643. Depicted as ruthless by royalist enemies, he was also regarded with suspicion by fellow parliamentarians. The accusations of cowardice levelled against him by a disgruntled and paranoid junior officer, Colonel Anthony Weldon, were probably without substance, and were contradicted by other commanders. However, Livesay was clearly one of a number of local military commanders who challenged the authority of Sir William Waller in the summer of 1644. Their disagreement was brought before the committee of both kingdoms in July 1644, and by the following September the two appear to have reached an uneasy reconciliation. Livesay's troops rejoined Waller's army until the spring of 1645, and although there were fresh accusations of mutinous behaviour, he went unpunished. He refused to serve in the New Model Army, and his place was taken by Henry Ireton.<br>
<br>Livesay was elected to parliament on 15 September 1645 as a recruiter for Queenborough, where he had been a freeman since 1641. He quickly emerged as a supporter of the independents and the army interest, and appears to have worked closely with the most radical members of the Commons. This was particularly clear during the counter-revolution of 1647, when he was one of the members who fled to the safety of the army in the face of presbyterian inspired riots in Westminster in July. When royalist riots broke out in Kent in December 1647 he returned to the county to quell the trouble, and spent much of the spring and summer of 1648 in service against royalists both there and in Surrey and Sussex. In August he was granted a commission of martial law in order to punish royalist spies in the region, and advocated harsh treatment for offenders. Once again, his troops were accused of disorder and plunder, and he had to be warned to keep them under control, for fear of disaffecting the community further. It seems likely that his men had become radicalized, and they certainly expressed approval of Pride's Purge in December 1648.<br>
<br>During a brief spell in parliament in April 1648 Livesay had opposed reopening talks with the king and indicated his republican credentials by refusing to commit himself to a constitution which included a monarchical element. He was an obvious candidate to serve on the high court of justice to try Charles I, and attended every day of the trial prior to signing the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. During the republic Livesay's troops were disbanded, leaving him able to concentrate on parliament, where he remained a controversial figure. His hardline views on the constitution led to a determination to defend the Commons against the council of state as the locus of sovereign power. He probably grew disillusioned by the drift of political events in 1653, and almost certainly opposed the protectorate established in 1654. During the mid-1650s he confined his activity to local affairs, serving as sheriff of Kent in both 1655 and 1656.<br>
<br>Like many republicans Livesay returned to Westminster when the Rump was recalled in May 1659, although illness delayed his appearance. Thereafter he supported civilian rule rather than the army faction based at Wallingford House. Upon the Restoration, however, he was forced to flee to the continent, and his lands were forfeited to the crown. Although there were reports that he had been murdered by a royalist mob in the Low Countries in October 1660, he was at Hanau in early 1662, and in the following year was allegedly involved in plotting against Charles II. In October 1663 he was rumoured to have returned to England in order to further such plans, although in June 1665 he was at Rotterdam, where he probably died shortly afterwards. When administration of his wife's estate was granted to one of their daughters in February 1666 Elizabeth Livesay (<i>d</i>. 1665) was described as a widow.<br>
