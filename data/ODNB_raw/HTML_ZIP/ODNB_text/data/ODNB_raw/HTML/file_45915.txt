<span class="headword">Kelly,  Richard John</span>  (1860&#150;1931), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Tuam, co. Galway, Ireland, the eldest son of Jasper Kelly (<i>d</i>. 1873), newspaper editor, and his wife, Delia, daughter of John Daly. He was descended from the Ouseley family of Courteen Hall, Northampton, through Margaret Ouseley, who married his great-grandfather Anthony Kelly of Castle Park, near Mount Talbot. Richard Kelly was educated in Blackrock and at the Queen's College, Galway, and entered the King's Inns, Dublin, in 1883. He spent a term at the Middle Temple in the autumn of 1884. Called to the Irish bar in 1886, he took silk in 1914. Kelly married Edith, a daughter of Bryan Mackey of Southampton, a distant cousin of Dame Sybil Thorndike; they had one son and five daughters.<br>
<br>Kelly's grandfather, also Richard John Kelly, was a follower of Daniel O'Connell, and founded the <span class="italic">Tuam Herald</span> in May 1837. Jasper Kelly succeeded him as proprietor in 1864, and his son succeeded in turn, in 1868. In 1851 the paper was described as Liberal, and claimed to represent the Roman Catholic church in the district. Richard Kelly attended the inaugural meeting of the Land League in Irishtown, co. Mayo, in April 1879, and he was a long-standing and trusted friend of Charles Stewart Parnell and Michael Davitt. By the 1880s the <span class="italic">Tuam Herald's</span> politics were nationalist. After the split in the Irish parliamentary party, and the death of Parnell, Richard Kelly supported John Redmond.<br>
<br>Despite his work on the newspaper Kelly also had a considerable career as a lawyer. He was a revising barrister for Dublin city, co. Cork, co. Armagh, and co. Donegal, and was crown prosecutor for co. Sligo. The author of a number of books on the law of newspaper libel and landlord and tenant legislation, he also edited volumes of Irish patriotic poetry and a life of Charles Kickham. He became vice-president of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society and wrote a history of Tuam.<br>
<br>In the latter part of his life Kelly lived in Dublin, where he was a governor of Richmond Hospital, a member of the Statistical Society and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. He was a governor of the National Bank. He died in Dublin on 3 September 1931 and was buried at Glasnevin cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
