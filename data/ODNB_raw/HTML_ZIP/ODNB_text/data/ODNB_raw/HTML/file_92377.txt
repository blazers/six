<span class="headword">Stewart <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Birkinshaw]</span>,  Mary Elizabeth Henderson</span>, Baroness Stewart of Alvechurch  (1903&#150;1984), <span class="occ">lecturer and politician</span>, was born at 72 St Mary's Road, Manningham, Bradford, on 8 May 1903, the daughter of Herbert Birkinshaw (<i>d</i>. 1941), commercial traveller, and his wife, Isabella Henderson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garbutt. Her earliest memory of Bradford was of soot on her pillow each morning. When she was four their family (including her brother and sister) moved to Alvechurch, Worcestershire. From 1913 she attended King Edward's High School for Girls, Birmingham, and in 1923 enrolled at Bedford College, London. After failing her intermediate exams she spent a year helping Southwark's poor through the Women's University Settlement and read for a social studies certificate. She then returned to study philosophy and graduated BA (honours, second class) in 1928, after which she taught sociology and psychology for the Workers' Educational Association (WEA). On 24 December 1931 she married Robert Godfrey Goodyear (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), advertisement clerk, of Luton; he was the son of Robert Norman Goodyear, textile stocktaker.<br>
<br>At a WEA summer school in 1934 she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39862/', "(Robert) Michael Maitland Stewart (1906&#150;1990)")</script>, a schoolmaster and a WEA tutor in economics and international relations. Their relationship flourished as her marriage disintegrated; at the outbreak of the war they took part in the WEA summer school at Frome, Wiltshire, where she began her involvement with the Fabian Society. On 26 July 1941, two months after her divorce was granted, she married Michael. The war separated them for much of their early married life: she was stationed around Britain, first as an air-raid shelter warden in London, then from the end of 1941 she held various postings in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, in which she was commissioned; he went overseas with the army intelligence corps.<br>
<br>After the war Mary Stewart resumed teaching WEA classes at the University of London, while Michael became Labour MP for Fulham East. Although she had no children from either marriage, she devoted much of her career to young people. As a psychologist she specialized in crime and education, and with the encouragement of a WEA colleague and mentor Barbara Wootton, she became a juvenile court magistrate in 1949. Seven years later she became joint chairman of the East London juvenile court, having sought a jurisdiction outside her husband's constituency. She drew on this experience in numerous publications, co-writing the Fabians' submission to the Ingleby committee on children and young people in 1958 and also the Fabians' response to the committee's report four years later. Her recommendations included raising the age of criminal responsibility from eight to fifteen and clearing criminal records when offenders reached the age of majority. Overall, Stewart urged a less punitive approach towards young offenders, an unpopular view but one which gained currency with the next government elected in 1964.<br>
<br>Between 1950 and 1979 Stewart was on the Fabian executive and served as chairman in 1962&#150;3. Her pamphlet <span class="italic">Unpaid Public Service</span> (1964) analysed the profile of local councillors and regional hospital board members, and recommended changes to their practices, such as evening meetings and improved travel expenses, in order to attract younger volunteers. Many of these recommendations were later implemented. In 1964 she retired from lecturing, and two years later she stood down from magistrates' bench because of her husband's position as foreign secretary, an office he held between 1965 and 1966 and from 1968 to 1970. Small, neat, and bespectacled with a regular smile, she (like Michael) was very shy and avoided the limelight; his unexpected appointment placed them in an unfamiliar situation. As honorary president of the Diplomatic Service Wives' Association she hosted social events for ambassadors' wives, but while devoted to her husband's career she preferred her own work to the role of grand spouse. In 1966 the health minister appointed her chairman of the governors of the Charing Cross Hospital and Medical School, which was moving to Fulham. As chairman she oversaw the opening of the new facility and ensured that its focus on training would not eclipse the needs of local patients. She held the position until 1974, when hospital governors were abolished by the reorganization of the NHS.<br>
<br>In January 1975 Stewart received a life peerage as Baroness Stewart of Alvechurch. Too old to give her best, she spoke only occasionally, on such issues as crime and education. She voted regularly but enjoyed an interlude in Luxembourg, where Michael was a member of the European parliament from 1975 to 1976. After retiring at the 1979 election he too was ennobled, making them the second husband-and-wife life peers after Barbara and Henry Brooke. The Stewarts were extremely close both personally and in their political views, and friends joked that they also grew more alike in appearance. After a short illness Mary died of respiratory failure and pneumonia at Chelmsford and Essex Hospital on 28 December 1984 and was buried in St Andrew's churchyard in Sandon, Essex.<br>
