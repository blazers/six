<span class="headword">Baverstock,  Donald Leighton</span>  (1924&#150;1995), <span class="occ">television producer and executive</span>, was born on 18 January 1924 at the maternity home in Glossop Terrace, Cardiff, the only son in the family of three children of Thomas Baverstock (1896&#150;1979), colliery clerk and later grocer, and his wife, Sarahann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1898&#150;1979), teacher. He attended Canton high school, Cardiff, from 1935 to 1941, and in 1942 went to Christ Church, Oxford, as an undergraduate cadet. Commissioned in the RAF between 1943 and 1946, he flew numerous operations with Bomber Command as a navigator. He returned to Oxford in 1946, graduating with a second-class degree in modern history in 1948. Of medium height, stocky, with dark wavy hair, his intensity, directness, and preoccupation with current matters characterized him as &#145;ebullient, pugnacious and unpredictable&#146;  (Briggs, 387). He smoked heavily and, later, drank.<br>
<br>In 1949, following spells teaching and with a shipping agent, Baverstock joined the BBC's general overseas service as a producer, making political and current affairs radio programmes. His ambition, though, lay in television, achieved in 1954 by appointment as a talks producer. His successes included an acclaimed eightieth birthday tribute to Sir Winston Churchill in the same year. The start of ITV in 1955 gave BBC television its first competition&#151;and additional permitted broadcasting hours. To exploit the extra time and aided by production assistant Alasdair Milne (a future BBC director-general), Baverstock produced an innovative topical interview programme, <span class="italic">Highlight</span> (1955&#150;7). On 17 August 1957 he married Gillian Mary Darrell Waters (1931&#150;2007), then working as a publishing assistant. She was the daughter of Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, army officer and book editor, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31939/', "Enid Blyton")</script>, children's writer; she had adopted the surname Darrell Waters on her mother's second marriage. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1957 the government allowed the BBC and ITV flexibility in allocating their hours. This ended the &#145;toddlers' truce&#146;, the 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. period when screens were blank, supposedly so that mothers could put children to bed without the distraction of television. Baverstock and Milne filled the gap by developing <span class="italic">Highlight</span> into a weeknightly magazine, <span class="italic">Tonight</span> (1957&#150;65). The programme established a new style. &#145;[It] had a scepticism towards authority and received opinion that was very refreshing &hellip; It was helping to shape the mood and attitude of the country, while &hellip; the mood and attitude of the country were helping to shape <span class="italic">Tonight</span>&#146;  (Bernard Levin, on <span class="italic">25 Years Ago&#151;Tonight</span>). Presented by the avuncular Cliff Michelmore, it made household names of its reporters (including Fyfe Robertson and Alan Whicker) and a trademark of its specially written topical songs. <span class="italic">Tonight</span>'s success depended also on the diversity of its stories. They ranged, for example, from a film about life on rubbish tips in Lima, to an interview with the teenage spokesman for the society for the prevention of cruelty to long-haired men. &#145;We were people questioning what was going on in the world &hellip; We didn't really have anything to say to the audience; we had questions to ask &hellip; Every so often we had a laugh&#146;  (Baverstock, on <span class="italic">25 Years Ago&#151;Tonight</span>). But he was tough. &#145;He would &hellip; dissect each item &hellip; with merciless criticism. His team respected his creative vision despite what was often intolerably rude behaviour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>In April 1961 Baverstock became assistant controller of programmes. &#145;I &hellip; decided to remove all kinds of programmes which &hellip; were losing audiences &hellip; There were endless pictures of birds &hellip; and the audience was showing its ennui&#146;. He recognized, too, the need, &#145;to force &hellip; BBC television to realise they had to schedule programmes after the [mid-evening] news as well as before&#146;  (Baverstock). He also led the search for original Saturday-night entertainment. The result&#151;<span class="italic">That Was The Week That Was</span> (1962&#150;3)&#151;set new standards for television satire. His masterly handling of the programme's coverage of President Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 captured the national mood. His managerial style, though, led to his BBC decline. &#145;His ill-considered over-promotion damaged both the television service and his own career&#146;  (Miall, 167). &#145;[He] had little talent for man-management, but plenty for interference and within a few months all four departmental heads had left&#146;  (ibid., 39&#150;40). In 1964 BBC2 opened with Baverstock and Michael Peacock, former editor of television news, respectively chiefs of programmes, BBC1 and BBC2. Their boss, Huw Wheldon, a future managing director, wanted them to switch jobs. Baverstock resisted and in 1965 he, Milne, and another <span class="italic">Tonight</span> producer, Tony Jay, resigned becoming, briefly, independent producers.<br>
<br>In 1967 the new ITV franchise holder Yorkshire Television appointed Baverstock its director of programmes, thus beginning another period of significant achievement. He founded the soap opera <span class="italic">Emmerdale Farm</span> and secured considerable space for Yorkshire Television programmes on national television. A former Yorkshire Television managing director John Fairley said, &#145;He was the nearest thing to a genius I ever came across in television &hellip; He built from scratch the best documentary department in British TV at that time and it lasted to the &hellip; mid 90s&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Baverstock's drinking led to his leaving Yorkshire in 1973 to head Granada Video Ltd (1974&#150;5). He rejoined the BBC (1975&#150;7) as a programme editor, but by then his creativity was ebbing. Retirement followed. In 1994 he and his wife, Gillian, were divorced. He died on 17 March 1995 at Airedale General Hospital, Steeton, Keighley, Yorkshire. He was buried on 24 March at Ilkley cemetery.<br>
