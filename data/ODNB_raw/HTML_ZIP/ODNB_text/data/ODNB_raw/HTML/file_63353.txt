<span class="headword">Atkins,  Humphrey Edward Gregory</span>, Baron Colnbrook  (1922&#150;1996), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 12 August 1922 at Tunmers, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, the only son of Captain Edward Davis Atkins (<i>d</i>. 1925), a former Indian army officer who had settled in Nyeri, Kenya, as a coffee planter, and his wife, Mary Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Preston. He lived in Kenya until the age of three, when his father was gored to death by a rhinoceros, and his mother returned with him to England. He was educated at Wellington College before entering the Royal Navy with a special cadetship in 1940. He first saw service as a midshipman in the battleship <i>Nelson</i>, but was then transferred, as a sub-lieutenant, to destroyers on convoy escort. A near tragedy at the age of nineteen, when his destroyer was sunk on north Atlantic convoy duty, was to change his life. He had to borrow clothes from Sir Robert Spencer-Nairn, first baronet, the &#145;lino king&#146; and former president of the Scottish Unionist Association, to go to a shoot on his estate. There he met Sir Robert's impressionable 17-year-old daughter (Adela) Margaret 
    (Maggie; <i>b</i>. 1924)
  , the youngest of his six children. After their marriage, on 21 January 1944, her life was initially a torment because she could never know whether he would come back from his convoy duties. In their 52-year marriage, in which she described him as a &#145;very phlegmatic and easy-going Anglo-Saxon&#146; and herself as an &#145;emotional Celt&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 8 Oct 1996), they were to have four children: Sheila Kathleen (<i>b</i>. 1944), Julia Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1946), Sally Mary (<i>b</i>. 1948), and Charles Edward Spencer (<i>b</i>. 1952).<br>
<br>Atkins's marriage into the wealthy and influential Spencer-Nairn family was to be his making. When he emerged from the Royal Navy in 1948 (with the rank of lieutenant) his first job was with his father-in-law's firm in Kirkcaldy. His first Conservative candidacy, in West Lothian in 1951, was helped by his father-in-law's clout among Scottish Unionists. When the couple moved south to continue his career he worked in the London office of Spencer-Nairn and then in that of its advertising agent. When he won Merton and Morden in 1955 he did not have to live on the MP's then limited stipend. They had three homes, including one at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight. Atkins remained Conservative MP for Merton and Morden until 1970, when he transferred to the safer seat of Spelthorne (which he represented until 1987).<br>
<br>Atkins's career in the tory whips' office began in opposition in 1967. When the tories returned to power in 1970 he became deputy chief whip (or treasurer of her majesty's household). In 1973 Edward Heath made him chief whip and a privy councillor. He had the reputation of being a softer whip than his predecessor, Francis Pym, and more willing to listen to rebel MPs acting out of principle. He showed stronger backbone than expected when Margaret Thatcher challenged Heath for the leadership in 1975. He insisted on the whips' office remaining neutral, as the custodian of the long-term interest of the party. Mrs Thatcher welcomed him as her own chief whip, although he failed her on one famous occasion. He told her that it would be easy to find a Scottish successor to Alick Buchanan-Smith, the shadow Scottish secretary who resigned in 1976 when she turned against devolution. She had to name rebel Teddy Taylor, who lost his seat in 1979.<br>
<br>Atkins's hardest appointment was as Northern Ireland secretary, from May 1979, where he followed Roy Mason, a tough Labour right-winger, who was popular with Unionists. When Atkins was named he was ridiculed in a Belfast headline: &#145;Humphrey Who?&#146;. His local knowledge was belittled by an anecdote about his being shown a coloured map during his first days. What, he asked, were the areas in orange? They were the protestant loyalists, he was told. And the green patches? Those were the Catholic republicans. And what was the area marked in blue? After some hesitation, &#145;That, Secretary of State, is Lough Neagh&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 8 Oct 1996). Jokes aside, Atkins's life was made hell by Mrs Thatcher's demands for instant results to be imposed on Ulster's warring politicians, then including Ian Paisley and a transplanted Enoch Powell. Behind the scenes the army urged that he make their commander a local &#145;supremo&#146;, allowed to detain thirty to forty leading terrorists. With the support of his wife, Maggie, who unexpectedly accompanied him, he affably resisted these pressures. Nevertheless, his period as secretary of state was marked by a steady deterioration of relations between the two communities, and was overshadowed first by the murder of Lord Mountbatten and then by the IRA hunger strikes in the Maze prison, which eventually led to eleven deaths.<br>
<br>In September 1981 Atkins was made lord privy seal with special responsibilities in the Foreign Office, as deputy to the foreign secretary, Lord Carrington, and the office's spokesman in the House of Commons. Again he was unlucky. The Foreign Office consistently misread the signs of Argentine pressure on the Falkland Islands, and made matters worse by endorsing the withdrawal from the south Atlantic of the seagoing gunboat HMS <i>Endurance</i>. On 2 April 1982 Atkins calmly reassured the House of Commons that there would be no Argentine invasion, several hours after the invasion had in fact begun. Honourably, he, Carrington, and the junior minister, Richard Luce, resigned within a matter of days.<br>
<br>Mrs Thatcher's loyalty to those who had served her well was legendary: following Atkins's resignation, she tried repeatedly to find him another top post. Her first attempt was in 1983, when she made it known that he was her preferred candidate to replace George Thomas as speaker of the House of Commons. The &#145;peasants' revolt&#146; of Conservative back-benchers ensured that Bernard Weatherill was elected instead. Nevertheless, Atkins was appointed in 1984 to the important post of chairman of the select committee on defence (a position he held until his retirement from the Commons in 1987). In 1986 he had the potentially embarrassing task of overseeing the committee's investigation of the Westland crisis, including allegations of improper conduct by Downing Street officials acting on the authority of the prime minister. Despite his personal loyalty to Mrs Thatcher, Atkins ensured that the investigation was as full and impartial as was possible in the circumstances, and in so doing he helped to establish the authority over the executive of parliamentary select committees.<br>
<br>In 1987 Atkins (who had been made KCMG in 1983) was elevated to the peerage as Baron Colnbrook of Waltham St Lawrence. He became chairman of the Association of Conservative Peers in 1990 and a member of the Press Complaints Commission in 1991. Thereafter his political activities tailed off as he fought the cancer from which he died, at his home, Tuckenhams, the Street, Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire, on 4 October 1996. He was survived by his wife, four children, and eight grandchildren.<br>
<br>Handsome and unfailingly courteous, Atkins was attractive to women and had hardly any enemies among men. His personality enabled him to soar high. Nevertheless, it is difficult to dissent from the judgement of one obituarist that he was &#145;a nearly man&#146;, whom &#145;misfortune and misjudgement dogged &hellip; at every turn, just when he was nearing the top of affairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 Oct 1996).<br>
