<span class="headword">Jones,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1762, <em>d.</em> 1831), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, who was baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, London, on 27 June 1762, was the elder of two sons of <a name="cosubject_56322"></a><span class="headword">John Jones</span>  (1736/7&#150;1808)<span class="occ"></span> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dillon. John Jones, the son of a stay maker of St Martin-in-the-Fields, had been apprenticed as a mathematical instrument maker and was made free of the Spectaclemakers' Company in 1758, the year of his marriage. He was in the Holborn area by 1776 and trading as an optician at 135 Holborn by 1782. William was apprenticed to his father in 1776, and was in partnership with him by 1784, not taking his freedom in the Spectaclemakers' Company until 1794.<br>
<br>In 1786 Thomas Jefferson (1734&#150;1824), later third president of the United States, patronized the Jones business on his only visit to London. Jefferson acquired a number of scientific instruments from some of the most eminent London makers, among them Peter Dollond and Jesse Ramsden, and this first link with a prestigious foreign customer must have assisted the Jones firm with subsequent overseas sales. Jefferson corresponded with the Joneses in 1787 and again in 1793. John Jones retired in 1791 to end his days at Islington, where he died on 15 August 1808. Apart from minor bequests, including &pound;10 to his nephew John Dillon, a printer, then working for his sons, he left everything to his wife during her lifetime and then to his sons William and Samuel. William was forced by ill health to retire early from business and also removed to Islington. He died, unmarried, in Brighton, on 17 February 1831, and was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56324"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Jones</span>  (1770&#150;1859)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 18 February 1770. He does not appear to have served an apprenticeship and, indeed, is a far more insubstantial figure than his elder brother; like him, he was a bachelor. He joined his brother in partnership in 1791 on the retirement of their father, obtaining his freedom of the Spectaclemakers' Company by patrimony in 1806. He continued to trade as W. and S. Jones long after his brother's departure. In his latter years he lived at Dalton House, St Albans, Hertfordshire, where he died on 10 October 1859, at the age of eighty-nine. The firm ceased to trade after this date.<br>
<br>W. and S. Jones traded under the sign of Archimedes, at 135 Holborn, next to Furnival's Inn, moving across the road to 30 Holborn around 1800. The firm was extremely prolific, selling a wide range of optical, mathematical, and philosophical instruments and apparatus in the middle ranges of price and quality, as detailed in their comprehensive catalogues, issued at frequent intervals. William Jones was a friend and pupil of the prominent lecturer and instrument maker Benjamin Martin, who effectively introduced Jones into a wide society of like-minded people. A major opportunity for the Jones business occurred in 1782, as a result of Martin's bankruptcy and death, and the subsequent sale of his business; in 1795&#150;6, a second, perhaps larger, boost resulted from the death of the younger George Adams and subsequent sales by his wife, Hannah. W. and S. Jones's trade must have benefited from the reduced competition after the cessation of two of the largest and apparently most successful contemporary London businesses. More important was its purchase of the copyright of the influential textbooks written by the two George Adamses, father and son: from 1797 onwards catalogues of the wares of W. and S. Jones, as illustrated in these texts, were priced and bound in the back of every volume. As a form of advertising, this appears to have had considerable success. It is possible that the copyright of Benjamin Martin's popular textbooks had also been purchased, as a number of these were revised by William Jones, and catalogues bound with them.<br>
<br>Among W. and S. Jones's more prestigious customers were the college at Harvard, supplied with apparatus to order between 1797 and 1817, and the prolific American collector Charles Nicholl Bancker, a customer during the 1820s. The company also drew up the auction catalogue for disposal of the third earl of Bute's magnificent collection, in 1793. Items bearing the firm's signature can be found in collections all over the Western world.<br>
