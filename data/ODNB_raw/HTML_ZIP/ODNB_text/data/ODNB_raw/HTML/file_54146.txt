<span class="headword">Magnus</span>, earl of Caithness and earl of Orkney  (<em>c.</em>1290&#150;1320/21), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, is called Magnus &#145;the fifth&#146; in the fifteenth-century genealogy of the earls, which also tells us that he was the son of the previous earl, John. Very little is known of the line of Angus earls who inherited the northern earldoms in the 1230s, but four of them bore the name Magnus, after their revered ancestor Magnus Erlendsson, martyred about 1115. One of the few certain facts about Magnus is that he had a long minority. Thanks to the efficient government of Edward I there is record that in 1303 the wardship of &#145;Munes&#146;, son and heir of the earl of Caithness, was granted to Weland of Stiklaw. A careerist in the Scottish administration, Weland had left Scotland when Edward invaded in 1296, moving to Norway in the following of Isabel Bruce, who married Erik Magnusson, king of Norway (<i>r</i>. 1286&#150;99). He came to Edward's peace when he was granted the wardship of Magnus for the earldom of Caithness, no doubt because he already controlled Orkney for the Norwegian royal administration. The earldom of Caithness was still in ward in 1309, but Magnus must have come of age before 1312.<br>
<br>Virtually the only evidence surviving about Earl Magnus's career relates to his involvement in high-level diplomatic negotiations. Being an earl in the kingdoms of both Scotland and Norway, his position was not an easy one. There was rivalry between the two in the maritime zones around the north and west of the Scottish mainland. However, the treaty of Perth of 1266 was renewed at Inverness in 1312, when Magnus gave his oath on behalf of the king of Scots as earl of Caithness, but sealed the Norwegian part of the indenture as earl of Caithness and Orkney. In the following spring it was in his Orkney earldom, as earl of Caithness and acting, along with the bishop of Caithness and the chancellor of Moray, on behalf of the king of Scots, that he paid over the &#145;annual&#146; 100 merks for that year and for the preceding five years to the commissioners of the king of Norway. Seven years later, in 1320, as earl of Caithness and Orkney he was listed seventh of the earls who addressed the declaration of Arbroath to the pope. Only once can we see Magnus acting as earl within his home territory of Orkney on matters concerning his earldom. In a report probably dating from the spring of 1320 and presented to Archbishop Eilif of Nidaros by Kormack, archdeacon of the Sudreys, and Grim, prebendary of Nidaros, it was said that Bishop William of Orkney had promised &#145;before Lord Magnus, earl of Orkney and Caithness, and Lady Catherine his wife, the chapter and many other worthies&#146;  (Lange and Unger, 9, no. 85) to amend the defects of his administration and to assign a certain portion of his rents to each church.<br>
<br>It is thought that Magnus died soon after sealing the declaration of Arbroath in April 1320 since in August 1321 King Robert addressed a letter to the bailies of the king of Norway in Orkney complaining about rebels being received there, which he is unlikely to have done had the earl been alive and active. In 1329 Countess Catherine was making purchases of land in Orkney, and was obviously acting on her own behalf as a widow. It is not clear whether Magnus left any heirs. The genealogy of the earls mentions none, but neither does it say that he left no heirs, as is noted of another earl. His children would certainly have been under age in 1320&#150;21 if he himself came of age only between 1309 and 1312. The absence of other claimants until 1330 suggests that there may have been a minor who did not reach maturity. In that year, however, the two earldoms passed to Malise, earl of Strathearn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1350), whose claim stemmed from his great-great-grandmother. The Scottish element of the joint earldoms was thereafter dominant.<br>
