<span class="headword">Hollis,  Thomas  Brand</span>  (<em>c.</em>1719&#150;1804), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was born Thomas Brand at The Hyde, near Ingatestone, Essex, the only son among three children of Timothy Brand (<i>d</i>. 1734), who had retired from his mercer's business in London, and Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1744), daughter of Thomas Michell of Rickling, Hertfordshire. He attended Brentwood and Felsted schools and, excluded from the English universities as a protestant dissenter, matriculated at Glasgow University, where Richard Baron was a friend; both were greatly influenced by Francis Hutcheson. His admission to the freedom of Glasgow in 1741 probably ended his academic career. Finding law uncongenial he declined a place at the Inner Temple in London the same year. He toured continental Europe in 1748&#150;9 with Thomas Hollis, whom he had met at the inns of court, and largely alone in 1750&#150;53. Thereafter he divided his time between London and The Hyde, which Sir William Chambers remodelled in 1761. He inherited almost all Hollis's property in 1774, adding his benefactor's surname to his own. The inheritance strengthened Brand Hollis's already comfortable patrimony.<br>
<br>Brand Hollis's connections, principally among dissenters, political radicals, and in the intellectual and charitable world, steadily expanded after returning to London. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1756 and of the Society of Antiquaries in 1757, became a member of the Academy of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce two years later, and was appointed a governor of Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals in 1754 and 1755 respectively. Partly through friendships with liberal Anglicans such as Francis Blackburne and John Jebb he became a Unitarian. He supported Theophilus Lindsey's Essex Street Chapel and contributed to the dissenters' college at Hackney from its foundation in 1786 to its demise ten years later. Brand Hollis was especially concerned for religious liberty and supported the 1787, 1789, and 1790 campaigns against the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, but was strongly anti-Catholic; contrary to Caroline Robbins he published nothing.<br>
<br>Above all, Brand Hollis advocated political reform. His first foray ended in humiliating disaster. Hoping to promote the cause in parliament he purchased the rotten borough of Hindon, Wiltshire, at the 1774 general election, but the election was challenged. He was convicted of corruption, unseated, fined 1000 marks, and gaoled for six months. Undeterred, he joined the parliamentary reform movement precipitated by the American War of Independence. He was a founder member of the Society for Constitutional Information in 1780, and as a member of the Essex and Dorset county associations collaborated with Christopher Wyvill of Yorkshire, whose modest programme of reform at the St Alban's tavern conference in March 1780 he supported without success. Brand Hollis was especially influential on the Westminster Committee, which appointed him and Jebb to a subcommittee authorized to consider general electoral matters. Using arguments drawn from James Burgh and other Commonwealthsmen, they persuaded it to recommend a complete recasting of the representative system, including annual parliaments, equal electoral districts, universal male suffrage, and the ballot. Such advanced proposals also came to nothing and possibly damaged the cause of moderate reform. Somewhat eccentrically he considered the City of London as the epitome of the English constitution, insisting that its officers were ultimately dependent on popular choice and declaring that its frequent elections provided a balance against usurpation and tyranny.<br>
<br>In 1788 Brand Hollis was a founder member of the Revolution Society and a steward at its commemoration of the revolution of 1688, arguing that another revolution in Britain could be averted by following its principles. Initially Brand Hollis approved of the French Revolution, but was horrified by its later course and feared a similar catastrophe in England. He denied assisting publication of Thomas Paine's <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span> in 1791 and giving him money the following year. Withdrawing from the Society for Constitutional Information in 1791 after its capture by more extreme reformers, but alarmed by ministerial attacks on free expression, he joined the moderate Society of the Friends of the People, and the Society of Friends to the Liberty of the Press in 1792&#150;3.<br>
<br>Brand Hollis deeply admired America. Deploring government policy towards the colonies before the revolution, he condemned the use of force and feared that both English and American liberty were at risk. He named trees at The Hyde after George Washington and other Americans and welcomed independence. Afterwards he became a close friend of John Adams, the first American minister in London, and his family. He also met and corresponded with several other Americans, including Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, whose Virginia statute for religious freedom he printed in the <span class="italic">Chelmsford Gazette</span> during the repeal campaign. A benefactor to New England institutions, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1783 and awarded an honorary doctorate by Harvard College in 1787. He greatly admired the United States constitution, which he reprinted.<br>
<br>Brand Hollis was said to possess every characteristic of a gentleman. Mild in disposition, amiable in temper but somewhat na&iuml;ve, he was averse to business of any kind, including the minutiae of his own affairs; his knowledge of virtu and antiquities was considered particularly chaste and correct. His health deteriorated from 1800 onward, and he left London the following year. He died on 9 September 1804 at The Hyde, and was buried at Ingatestone parish church, leaving the bulk of his property to John Disney, his friend since the 1780s. His sister Elizabeth kept house for him; he never married.<br>
