<span class="headword">Brownell <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Blair, Pitt-Rivers]</span>,  Sonia Mary</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Sonia Orwell]</span>  (1918&#150;1980), <span class="occ">literary editor, writer, and friend of artists and intellectuals</span>, was born Sonia Mary Brownell on 25 August 1918 at Mesra Thaua, Ranchi, Bihar, India, the younger daughter of Charles Neville Brownell (1882&#150;1918), a freight broker in Calcutta, and Beatrice Edith Binning (1890&#150;1959). On 5 January 1920 Beatrice married Edgar Geoffrey Dixon (1880&#150;1953), a successful chartered accountant, whose alcoholism wrecked his career in Calcutta and broke up his marriage after the family returned to England in 1927. Sonia had a sister, Bay, and a younger half-brother, Michael, and from 1931 Beatrice brought up her children unaided. Raised a Roman Catholic, Sonia was educated at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Roehampton, London, from 1927 to 1935 and perfected her French at Neuch&acirc;tel, Switzerland, but in the summer of 1936 had to be brought back to London, distraught, the sole survivor of a boating tragedy.<br>
<br>In 1938 Sonia worked for Professor Eugene Vinaver on his edition of Malory's <span class="italic">Morte d'Arthur</span>. By this time she had firmly renounced her Roman Catholicism. Also in 1938 she began sitting for portraits at the Euston Road School of Drawing and Painting, who named her the Euston Road Venus on account of her radiant blond beauty. She was drawn by Rodrigo Moynihan and painted by Claude Rogers and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39956/', "William Coldstream")</script>. Coldstream and she were lovers from 1939 to 1941 and through him she met Stephen Spender and Cyril Connolly, co-editors of <span class="italic">Horizon</span>, and its financial backer, Peter Watson, who were to remain her lifelong friends. After working as John Lehmann's secretary on <span class="italic">New Writing</span> in 1941 and doing war work at the Ministry of War Transport, in 1945 she joined <span class="italic">Horizon</span> as editorial secretary and became, in effect, Cyril Connolly's working partner when Connolly (then sole editor) and Peter Watson were absent. In late 1945 she had a very brief affair with the recently widowed George Orwell (pseudonym of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31915/', "Eric Arthur Blair")</script>) and later an unhappy affair with the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908&#150;1961). On 13 October 1949 she married Orwell, seriously ill with tuberculosis, who died on 21 January 1950; subsequently she mostly used the surname Orwell. On 12 August 1958 she married Michael Augustus Lane Fox Pitt-Rivers (1917&#150;1999), a wealthy farmer, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1965.<br>
<br>From 1951 to 1956 Sonia worked as a reader and editor for Weidenfeld and Nicolson and persuaded them to publish Saul Bellow, Nigel Dennis, Elizabeth Hardwick, Dan Jacobson, and Mary McCarthy. She helped to organize the successful Writers' Conference at the 1962 Edinburgh Festival and from 1964 to 1965 in Paris she was a co-editor of the international review <span class="italic">Art and Literature</span>. She translated many articles from French and in 1966 translated <span class="italic">Days in the Trees</span>, by her friend Marguerite Duras, for the Royal Shakespeare Company.<br>
<br>Sonia took her duties as Orwell's literary executor seriously and was resolute that his work should not be misrepresented or commercialized. She gave all his papers to the Orwell Archive, as a founder trustee, when it was set up in 1961 at University College, London, to create a centre for Orwell studies. She was responsible for the publication in 1968 of the four-volume <span class="italic">Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell</span>, edited by herself and Ian Angus, which further enhanced Orwell's reputation. When Mary McCarthy disparaged Orwell and alleged bias in the editing of the <span class="italic">Collected Essays</span>, Sonia wrote a trenchant and witty rebuttal (<span class="italic">Nova</span>, June&#150;July 1969), which makes it a matter for regret that she so undervalued her own literary ability that she wrote less than a score of articles and reviews. Orwell's injunction in his will that no biography of him be written resulted in her upsetting several people and caused her anguish up to her death. She was also tormented while she was dying by an impending lawsuit about the Orwell estate that she had initiated but was forced reluctantly to settle out of court because of her physical condition.<br>
<br>Sonia could be bossy, high-handed, presumptuous, noisy, and anti-male, which set many against her, particularly when her behaviour, at certain periods, was fuelled by too much drink or accompanied by strong language, but, in Stephen Spender's words, she &#145;still remained underneath the warm-hearted, generous, spontaneous person she was all her life&#146;  (Spender, 435). She had a devoted circle of friends, which included J. R. Ackerley, W. H. Auden, Francis Bacon, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Michel Leiris, and Angus Wilson. Prompted by her passionate love of literature and her admiration of imagination and intelligence, Sonia was enthusiastic in her encouragement of writers she befriended and frequently helped them materially. She was lavish in her hospitality and responded instantly and tirelessly to the emotional, physical, and financial needs of her friends who were in distress, as when, for instance, she financially supported Jean Rhys and in 1975 organized an appeal, after Cyril Connolly died in debt, which raised over &pound;40,000 for his widow and children. Sonia was rewarded by being cared for affectionately by her friends when she was dying of cancer. She died in St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, London, on 11 December 1980, and was buried on 18 December in the Putney Vale cemetery. She left everything she derived from Orwell, which was the bulk of her estate, to his adopted son, Richard Blair.<br>
