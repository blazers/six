<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hayllar family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1850&#150;<em>c.</em>1900), <span class="occ">painters</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_67583"></a><span class="headword">James Hayllar</span>  (1829&#150;1920)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 3 January 1829, probably at The Hornet, Whyke, Chichester. He was baptized on 13 February at St Pancras, Eastgate Square, Chichester, the son of Thomas Hayllar (1794&#150;1859), coal merchant, farmer, and miller, and his wife, Mary Ann Child (1794&#150;1885). Richard Cobden was his cousin on his father's side. He was educated at Midhurst grammar school and subsequently studied under the marine artists William and John Cantiloe Joy. In 1848 he became a resident pupil of Francis Stephen Cary, who had taken over Henry Sass's academy in Bloomsbury in 1842; he remained with the Carys at 21 Bloomsbury Street until 1851&#151;even after his entry to the Royal Academy Schools in 1849&#151;while working as a portraitist, principally in crayons. In October 1851 he travelled to Italy with his friend John Cavell&#151;to whose sister Ellen he had recently become engaged&#151;and spent two years in Rome (where he met Lord Leighton) and Florence studying from the antique and old masters. On his return in October 1853 he resumed portrait painting, mainly in oils, taking studios in London in Berners Street in 1854 and Great Ormond Street in 1855; <span class="italic">Lady Mynzomdie</span> (exh. RA, 1854)&#151;a portrait of Ellen Cavell&#151;and <span class="italic">John Cavell</span> (exh. RA, 1855) were among his first exhibited works. He continued to paint portraits throughout his life, his most famous commissions being for Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, the duke and duchess of St Albans, and General Hardy.<br>
<br>On 8 March 1855 James Hayllar married Ellen Phoebe Cavell (1827&#150;1899), the daughter of a law stationer, and aunt of Edith Cavell. Although he exhibited from a studio, 1 Langham Chambers, Langham Place, between 1860 and 1864, from 1855 until 1875 they lived at 15 Mecklenburgh Square, where his father-in-law, John Cavell, was head of the household until his death in 1863 and where, between 1856 and 1868, they had nine children, four boys and five girls. <a href="#cosubject_68062">Jessica</a>, <a href="#cosubject_68063">Edith</a>, <a href="#cosubject_68064">Kate</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_68065">Mary [<i>see below</i>]</a> all became professional painters.<br>
<br>James Hayllar had exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists (SBA) from 1851. From 1855 his work was also shown at the British Institution, the Liverpool Academy (LA), and the Royal Manchester Institution, and in subsequent years at the Royal Hibernian Academy, the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours, and the Atkinson Art Gallery, Southport, among other galleries. In the 1850s he exhibited landscapes and genre subjects such as <span class="italic">The Teetotaller and Tippler</span> (exh. SBA and LA, 1855) and <span class="italic">Bookworm and Grub</span> (exh. LA, 1857). During the 1860s he also experimented with historical genre, appending lengthy quotations to titles such as <span class="italic">The incident out of which arose Lord Mansfield's decision that as soon as a slave set his foot upon English territory, he became free</span> (exh. RA, 1864; V&amp;A), the latter subject having been suggested to him by Richard Cobden. It was not until 1866 that he won acclaim, with a painting entitled <span class="italic">Miss Lily's Carriage Stops the Way</span> (exh. RA, 1866; exh. Sothebys, 2 November 1994), the first of a series that included <span class="italic">Miss Lily's First Flirtation</span> (1867; exh. Sothebys, 18 March 1987) and <span class="italic">Miss Lily's Return from the Ball</span> (exh. RA, 1867; exh. Sothebys, 2 November 1994), depicting one of his small daughters; all three were engraved by Robert Graves. The charm and importance of children in an adult world became James Hayllar's principal and most popular theme. He missed election as an associate of the Royal Academy by one vote, but in 1876 was successfully elected a member of the Society of British Artists.<br>
<br>Between 1865 and 1872 the Hayllars rented a country house called Carlton Rookery, near Saxmundham, in Suffolk, where from April they spent five or six months of every year. The children engaged in numerous outdoor activities and acted in plays written by their father. There are also artistic records (chiefly rural genre scenes and landscapes) of visits to Boulogne between 1862 and 1886. The period 1872&#150;5 was spent in London, at which time all five girls attended a day school in Gower Street that was associated with Bedford College. In 1875 the family settled in the country, at Castle Priory, a large house fronting the Thames at Wallingford, Berkshire, where they remained until 1899. George Dunlop Leslie RA, also with a large family, lived next door. Sport and physical exercise were an important part of life at Castle Priory. Hayllar taught his daughters to swim and also to row, as a result of which the four eldest were all accomplished oarswomen; coxed by their father, they used to row their boat 27 miles in a morning to the Henley regatta. On leaving school Hayllar's daughters and his youngest son, Algernon, received art instruction at home. In an old laundry building converted into a studio their father taught them drawing, painting, and perspective, with evenings devoted to modelling, etching, and engraving. His method, according to his daughter Jessica, was &#145;never to let anything pass that was not quite correct in form or relation to its surroundings&#146;  (Hayllar, 13). Algernon Victor (<i>b</i>. 1868), having been apprenticed to Cotton Webb for six months, started a career as an engraver and exhibited two engravings at the Royal Academy in 1889. The four daughters who became painters (primarily in oils) specialized initially in meticulously rendered still life and, throughout their careers, in subjects drawn from their comfortable life at Castle Priory.<br>
<br>Children remained focal in James Hayllar's work, chiefly in the context of local village life, examples being <span class="italic">The Only Daughter</span> (exh. RA, 1875; Forbes Magazine Collection, New York), <span class="italic">As the Twig is Bent so is the Tree Inclined</span> (exh. SBA, 1879; exh. Christopher Wood Gallery, March 1983), and <span class="italic">The Centre of Attraction</span> (exh. RA, 1891; Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight), for which he was awarded a silver medal. Jessica described his pictures at this time as &#145;subjects to bring the poor and well-to-do together, kindly acts and interest shown in various ways&#146;  (Hayllar, 11).<br>
<br>James Hayllar last exhibited in 1898, although he continued to sketch landscapes until the end of his life. In 1899 his wife, Ellen, died and he moved with two of his daughters, Jessica and Kate, to Redholme, 14 Cambridge Road, Bournemouth, where he died on 9 March 1920.<br>
<br>The eldest daughter, <a name="cosubject_68062"></a><span class="headword">Jessica Ellen Hayllar</span>  (1858&#150;1940)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 16 September 1858 at 15 Mecklenburgh Square, London. She was the most prolific painter of the five sisters and exhibited at the Society of British Artists and the Dudley Gallery from 1879, the Royal Academy from 1880 (until 1915), the Royal Manchester Institution from 1882, the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours from 1883, and widely in the provinces. After still-life subjects such as <span class="italic">Going to &#145;my Uncle's&#146;</span> (exh. RA, 1880; exh. Christies, 6 May 1983) Jessica Hayllar painted domestic scenes, often including children, that depicted everyday occurrences at Castle Priory&#151;for example, <span class="italic">House Cleaning</span> (exh. SBA, 1882&#150;3)&#151;as well as more important family occasions, such as <span class="italic">Christmas Comes but Once a Year</span> (exh. RA, 1881), <span class="italic">Fresh from the Font</span> (exh. RA, 1887), <span class="italic">The Return from Confirmation</span>, exh. RA, 1888; exh. Christies, 3 February 1978), and <span class="italic">The Day of the Wedding</span> (exh. Royal Manchester Institution, 1882). Her paintings&#151;which often feature doorways and windows&#151;are notable for their effective perspective and suggestion of depth; the same recessive view through interconnecting rooms characterizes <span class="italic">A Coming Event</span> (exh. RA, 1886), <span class="italic">Autumn Sunlight</span> (exh. RA, 1891), and <span class="italic">Teaching</span> (1895), and windows provide not only interesting effects of light but detailed views of the garden beyond. Figures (usually family members), furnishings, and flowers are painted with equal emphasis by Jessica Hayllar, whose approach has been compared with that of the snapshot photographer  (Wood, May 1974, 5). From about 1900 she was confined to a wheelchair as a result of an accident (according to family tradition she was knocked down by a carriage) and during the rest of her life in Bournemouth she chiefly painted flowers, azaleas in particular. She died, unmarried, on 7 November 1940 at Hill House, Perry Hill, Worplesdon, Surrey.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_68063"></a><span class="headword">Edith Parvin Hayllar</span>  (1860&#150;1948)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 15 May 1860, also at 15 Mecklenburgh Square, London. She too depicted daily life at Castle Priory, in paintings such as <span class="italic">Amy's Birthday</span> (exh. SBA, 1885) and <span class="italic">More Hindrance than Help</span> (1893; exh. Sothebys, Belgravia, London, 24 October 1978). Her work reveals a particular interest in subjects connected with the family's numerous sporting activities: these included hunting, as depicted in <span class="italic">This Way, Sir!</span> (exh. SBA, 1882; exh. Sotheby Beresford Adams, Chester, 31 July 1981); shooting, as in <span class="italic">The 1<sup>St</sup> of September</span> (exh. RA, 1887; exh. Sothebys, London, 25 November 1983) and <span class="italic">The 1<sup>St</sup> of October</span> (exh. RA, 1888; exh. Christies, London, 18 October 1974); and tennis&#151;<span class="italic">A Summer Shower</span> (exh. RA, 1883; Forbes Magazine Collection) engagingly portrays an interlude in a mixed doubles. Of the four sisters Edith alone painted the Thames, in works such as <span class="italic">Feeding the Swans</span> (exh. Sothebys, 6 November 1996) and <span class="italic">A Punting Party</span>. The settings in Edith Hayllar's figure compositions are always painted in great detail, with careful attention to the particularities of flowers, feathers (in dead game), and household objects, as well as to the social interaction between individuals that forms the subject of a work.<br>
<br>She exhibited at the Society of British Artists (1881/2&#150;1889), the Royal Academy (1882&#150;97), and the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours (1883/4&#150;1895/6). On 9 June 1896 she married the Revd Edward Bruce Mackay (1861&#150;1921), rector of Wallingford and afterwards of Sutton Courtenay, with whom she had four children. She did not paint after her marriage, and died in Guildford, Surrey, on 3 January 1948.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_68065"></a><span class="headword">(Alexandra) Mary Hayllar</span>  (1862&#150;1950)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Mecklenburgh Square on 18 November 1862. She exhibited still lifes, such as <span class="italic">Lawn Tennis Season</span> (<i>c</i>.1881; Southampton Art Gallery), and figure subjects usually including children&#151;for example, <span class="italic">Helping Gardener</span> (exh. RA, 1885; exh. Sothebys, 27 March 1996)&#151;with her subject matter, like that of her sisters, drawn entirely from life at Castle Priory. She was mainly represented at the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists (1880&#150;85), the Dudley Gallery (1881&#150;4), and the Royal Manchester Institution (1882&#150;4). On 1 July 1885 she married Henry Watkins Wells (1855/6&#150;1932), a brewer, and largely abandoned painting, except for miniatures of children. She died at Stone Hall, Wallingford, Berkshire, on 6 January 1950. <a name="cosubject_68064"></a><span class="headword">(Beatrice) Kate Hayllar</span>  (1864&#150;1959)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 1 September 1864 at 15 Mecklenburgh Square, London. She exhibited still lifes, often featuring flowers, at the Society of British Artists (1883&#150;1888/9)&#151;where her first exhibited painting was bought by the princess of Wales&#151;and the Royal Academy (1885&#150;98). About 1898 she became a nurse and in 1899 she moved to Bournemouth with her father and sister Jessica. Later she lived with her sister Mary at Wallingford, Berkshire, where she died on 8 October 1959.<br>
