<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tull,  Walter Daniel John</span>  (1888&#150;1918), <span class="occ">footballer and army officer</span>, was born on 28 April 1888 at 57 Walton Road, Folkestone, Kent, the fifth child of Daniel Tull (<i>c</i>.1856&#150;1897) and his wife, Alice Elizabeth Palmer (<i>c</i>.1853&#150;1895). Daniel, a carpenter, was born in Barbados and in 1876 settled in Folkestone. Through attendance at the Grace Hill Wesleyan Methodist Chapel he met Alice, born in Hougham, Kent. She gave birth to six children. In 1896, a year after the death of Alice from cancer, Daniel married her cousin Clara Alice Susannah Palmer. They produced a daughter Miriam, born on 11 September 1897. Three months later Daniel died from heart disease. Unable to cope with five stepchildren and an infant child of her own, Clara placed the youngest boys&#151;Edward, eleven, and Walter, nine&#151;in the children's home and orphanage in Bonner Road, Bethnal Green, on 24 February 1898. Edward was adopted in 1900 by the Warnock family of Glasgow, where he qualified as a dentist in 1912 and practised, probably as the first black dentist in Britain, at 419 St Vincent Street (as Edward James Alexander Tull-Warnock) until his death in 1950.<br>
<br>Walter Tull served an apprenticeship as a printer but made his name as a footballer. In 1908&#150;9, his first season in senior competitive football, he was described as the &#145;catch of the season&#146; for his team  (<span class="italic">Football Star</span>). Clapton won the amateur cup, the London county amateur cup, and London senior cup. Tottenham Hotspur, impressed by his coolness, skilled technique, and robust tackling invited him on their summer tour of Argentina and Uruguay. On return he was invited to sign professionally, and made his first team d&eacute;but in Tottenham's inaugural game in the first division, away at Sunderland. His home d&eacute;but was against FA cup holders Manchester United in front of a crowd of 32,000:<blockquote>[Tull's] display on Saturday must have astounded everyone who saw it. Such perfect coolness, such judicious waiting for a fraction of a second in order to get a pass in not before a defender has worked to a false position, and such accuracy of strength in passing, I have not seen for a long time &hellip; Tull is very good indeed. (<span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, 13 Sept 1909)</blockquote>He had &#145;much to contend against on account of his colour&#146;, commented one contemporary (but anonymous) journalist. During a match at Bristol in October 1909 the same reporter notes he received &#145;a cowardly attack on him in language lower than Billingsgate&#146;. Yet, &#145;Tull is so clean in mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football &hellip; [He] was the best forward on the field&#146;  (undated press cutting, Finlayson collection). Mysteriously, by the end of the month, he had been dropped.<br>
<br>At the end of the following season (1910&#150;11) Tull was transferred to Herbert Chapman's Northampton Town, for whom he played over 110 matches, mostly as an inside forward. In December 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in the British army&#151;the first among his colleagues to do so&#151;and was appointed lance-corporal in the 17th (1st football) battalion, the Middlesex regiment. He was promoted to corporal then lance-sergeant before he had seen any action. In April 1916, after six months in France, he was hospitalized, suffering from shell shock. In September 1916 he returned to action with the 23rd (2nd football) battalion, which suffered heavy losses in the battle of the Somme. He then returned to Britain for officer training at Gailes in Ayrshire and on 10 May 1917 he was appointed to a commission in the special reserve of officers, before rejoining the 23rd battalion of the Middlesex regiment as a second lieutenant.<br>
<br>Not only was it virtually impossible for a man of colour to be commissioned an officer, but the <span class="italic">Manual of Military Law, 1914</span> stated that &#145;aliens [including blacks must] &hellip; not &hellip; exercise any actual command or power&#146;  (p. 471). He came to hate the conflict but was decorated with the 1914&#150;15 star and British war and victory medals. Yet Tull led his men and was mentioned in dispatches for his &#145;gallantry and coolness&#146; at the battle of Piave in Italy in January 1918. He died, unmarried, on 25 March 1918, shot through the head in no man's land near Favreuil, France, during the second battle of the Somme. Subsequently the commanding officer of the 23rd battalion recommended him for a Military Cross. Tull, through his actions, ridiculed those barriers that tried to deny people of colour equality with their contemporaries, revealing the shallow substance of these obstacles by the strength of his integrity. A garden of remembrance for all those connected with Northampton Town Football Club who died in the two world wars, with a sculpture to commemorate Tull forming its centrepiece, was dedicated on 11 July 1999.<br>
