<span class="headword">Canville <span class="st"> [Camville]</span>,  Richard  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1191), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the son of <a name="cosubject_60655"></a><span class="headword">Richard  de Canville</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1176)<span class="occ"></span> and his second wife, Millicent, widow of Robert Marmion (<i>d</i>. 1143/4), and came of a family originating at Canville-les-Deux-&Eacute;glises near Yvetot in upper Normandy. In England their most substantial landholding comprised nine knights' fees in the counties of Leicester, Northampton, and Warwick, in 1166 held from the honour of Mowbray by Walter de Canville, who was believed to be a cousin of Richard the elder. The latter also acquired lands in Essex, Warwickshire, and Somerset, and in addition obtained the manor of Stanton Harcourt in Oxfordshire as part of the marriage portion of his second wife, Millicent, a cousin of Adeliza of Louvain (<i>d</i>. 1151), second wife of Henry I. He served as a leading member of the household of King Stephen and later of Henry II, by whom he was rewarded with the custody of valuable estates at Little Stretton in Leicestershire and Sutton in Northamptonshire. He accounted as sheriff of Berkshire in 1156, and in 1176 was sent as an envoy to Sicily over the marriage of Henry II's daughter Joan. He died in Apulia that same year, having earlier made numerous gifts to the religious, including the Cistercian abbey of Combe in Warwickshire, which he founded in 1150. He was succeeded in the bulk of his estate by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4543/', "Gerard de Canville")</script>, his son of his first marriage, to Alice.<br>
<br>Richard de Canville the younger (<i>d</i>. 1191), who followed his father into the service of Henry II, appears to have inherited his father's land at Stretton and his mother's interest in the manor of Stanton Harcourt. In 1189 he attended the coronation of Richard I, and was appointed one of the commanders of Richard's crusading fleet. He embarked in the spring of 1190 and negotiated a truce at Lisbon with the king of Portugal, before arriving with his ships at Marseilles, where he was joined by King Richard. At Messina in Sicily he was one of the sureties for a truce between Richard and King Tancred, and in the summer of 1191 was appointed joint governor of Cyprus, with Robert of Thornham (<i>d</i>. 1211). However, he fell ill soon afterwards, and having rejoined the king at Acre in the Holy Land, died there in June 1191. By his marriage to Hawise, daughter of Walter Fitzwilliam, he acquired the barony of Whalton in Northumberland, but in 1188, in an exchange agreed with his sister-in-law Constance and her husband, Ralph de Crammaville, resigned his rights at Whalton in exchange for land in Leicestershire. His estates at Little Stretton and Stanton Harcourt passed after his death to his daughter Isabella, married to Robert de Harcourt.<br>
