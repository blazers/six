<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyd, Sir  Gerald Farrell</span>  (1877&#150;1930), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at 2 Colville Terrace West, Kensington, London, on 19 November 1877, the second son of Robert Boyd, merchant, and his wife, Lydia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Isaacs. Educated at St Paul's School, he failed Sandhurst entry and enlisted as a private soldier in the Devonshire regiment in October 1895, giving 17 October 1877 as his date of birth, as he would otherwise have been too young.<br>
<br>By 1899 Boyd was a sergeant, going with his battalion to South Africa in that year. He had a good war, being awarded the DCM&#151;not an easy decoration to win, since a tiny pension accompanied it&#151;and being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the field into the East Yorkshire regiment in May 1900. He had a busy war, too, being present at the relief of Ladysmith, Colenso (where he was captured but escaped), Wittebergen, and numerous other operations. While a second lieutenant, commanding a mounted infantry section, he was also appointed DSO and mentioned in dispatches three times. At the time he was the only officer to be DSO and to hold the DCM. In 1902 he was promoted lieutenant and in 1904 captain in the Leinster regiment. In 1907, appointed adjutant to his regimental depot at Birr, King's county, he courted Grace Sophia (1885&#150;1954), daughter of Arthur Hugo Florian de Burdet Burdett, landowner, of Coolfin, Banagher, King's county. They married on 9 January 1913 and had two sons. In September 1912 Boyd took on his first staff job, as brigade major (chief of the brigade staff) of the 11th infantry brigade.<br>
<br>Having received a glowing confidential report from his superior, recommending him for accelerated promotion, Boyd went as a captain with 11th brigade to France in August 1914. He stayed in that post until February 1915, when he left to be a general staff officer, second grade (GSO2), on the 1st division staff. He was promoted a substantive major in the Royal Irish regiment the next month, receiving a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy the following day. In July 1915 he was appointed GSO1 (again chief of staff) of 6th division, in which appointment he remained until June the following year, when he rose to temporary brigadier-general and chief of staff (BGGS) of the 5th corps. In less than two years he had risen from captain to brigadier-general. While a brigade major he was wounded (at Le Cateau), and was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>After two years as brigadier general of the 5th corps, in July 1918 Boyd was given his first field command, as general officer commanding 170th brigade, in 57th division. Though he spent several months training his brigade, he commanded it in action only for a few days. Nevertheless, these were during the battles of the Scarpe at the end of August 1918, and of the Drocourt-Qu&eacute;ant line at the beginning of September. In both the brigade's efforts were attended with some success.<br>
<br>On 4 September 1918 Boyd, aged forty, was promoted to temporary major-general and given command of the 46th (north midland) division. This formation had suffered very badly on the first day of the Somme in 1916 and thereafter had not been employed in any major operation. It might, therefore, have been seen as by no means a first-rank division, but under Boyd's command it achieved what many historians view as the finest feat of arms by British troops of the entire war. This was the storming of the Hindenburg line's main position at Bellenglise on 29 September 1918. Intended as a subsidiary attack to the main assault led by Australian and American forces to the north, which in fact was held up, the 46th division's attack, in which the troops crossed the steep-sided St Quentin Canal using lifebelts borrowed from channel steamers, cork rafts, and the like, was completely successful, as were subsequent operations to consolidate the success and force the Germans out of their last prepared positions. 4000 prisoners and 70 guns were captured. Boyd has been regarded as embodying &#145;the &#147;can-do&#148; spirit of the army of 1918&#146;  (Boyd). By the end of the war he had been mentioned in dispatches four times and was created CMG in 1918 and CB in 1919.<br>
<br>Boyd continued in command of the 46th division after the armistice, and then was allocated to take over the 6th division, part of the British army of the Rhine, occupying an area around Cologne. This command officially commenced on 2 April 1919, but on 10 April Boyd was appointed brigadier general and chief of staff at the general headquarters of the British army of the Rhine and on 3 June was made a substantive major-general. In January 1920 he took command of the Dublin military district during the Anglo-Irish war, a challenging appointment for him in view of his family connections with the southern Irish landed gentry. His main task was to chase members of Sinn F&eacute;in, using his nine infantry battalions, plus armoured cars and tanks, with RAF support. In addition, Black and Tans and auxiliary police were at his disposal. He organized raids on private houses in search of wanted men and arms, and it was on his orders that Arthur Griffith was arrested in November 1920. At one point Boyd had contact with an IRA peace envoy, but nothing came of their meeting; in any case he was not empowered to agree anything with the latter. He was created KCB in 1923.<br>
<br>Boyd was commandant of the Indian Staff College at Quetta from 1923 to 1927, after which he returned to Britain to be military secretary to the secretary of state for war. He died of cerebral spinal fever at the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital, London, on 12 April 1930. After a funeral at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, he was buried at Putney Vale cemetery.<br>
