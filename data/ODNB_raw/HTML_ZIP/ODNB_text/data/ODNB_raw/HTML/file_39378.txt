<span class="headword">Hill,  Jenny</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Elizabeth Thompson]</span>  (1848&#150;1896), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer</span>, was born in Paddington, Middlesex. Her childhood is obscured by legends spread by herself and others. Her father, Michael Thompson (1812/13&#150;1881), was reported to be a watcher at a cab stand. Her stage d&eacute;but was made at the age of six or seven, when she performed as the legs of the goose in <span class="italic">Mother Goose</span> (Aquarium Theatre, Westminster), and her first appearance at a London music-hall took place about 1860 at the Dr Johnson, a pot-house in Fleet Street, at the usual fee of 3<i>s</i>. a night with refreshments. All accounts state that about 1862 she was apprenticed under articles to a Bradford tavern singsong for five or seven years, entailing drudgery and starvation which seriously jeopardized her health. Her first weekly salary was &pound;1 at the Winchester Music-Hall, Stockwell, in 1863.<br>
<br>Hill may have broken her indenture by marrying John Wilson Woodley (<i>d</i>. 1890), an acrobat under the name Jean Pasta, on 28 May 1866. The agent Maurice de Frece is credited with taking her back to London, where her first double turns took place at Deacon's and the Raglan, at a wage of 30<i>s</i>. per hall. By 1871 she was earning &pound;6 a week at the London Pavilion. Another agent, Hugh J. Didcott, bestowed on her the sobriquet the &#145;Vital Spark&#146;, which stuck.<br>
<br>From 1868 to 1893 Hill was a star of the London and north-country halls. Part of her success lay in a ready wit and voluble exchanges with the audience, improvised to fit each district. Small, sharp-featured, pretty at a distance, but scarred by smallpox, she is credited with originating female low comedy in the halls. The comedian Harry Randall considered her the most versatile artist he had ever seen; she could put across racy patter, perform an energetic cellar-flap dance, yodel a ballad, and then reduce her public to tears with her pathos. Until the late 1870s she sang songs launched by others, but then introduced &#145;'Arry&#146;, written for her by E. V. Page, in which she impersonated a bantering coster swell. In 1886 she introduced dramatic character songs, which &#145;made a decided change in the style of the ballads of the day&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Clipper</span>), pathetic dramatic <i>scenas</i> like her favourite, &#145;The Little Stowaway&#146;, by Fred Bowyer. The most durable of these were &#145;The City Waif&#146; and &#145;Masks and Faces&#146;, inspired by Charles Dickens and G. R. Sims. John Hollingshead speculated that &#145;her sense of character&#151;low life, of course&#151;and her dramatic power of conjuring up solid pictures of men and women who never appeared bodily on the stage, would have delighted the elder Mathews&#146;  (Hollingshead, 1.99), and a later commentator referred to her &#145;democratic appeal based on an intimacy with the poorest members of her audience&#146;  (Scott, 207).<br>
<br>At the height of her career Hill earned &pound;30 a night per hall, often appearing at three or four locations nightly. Her forays into music-hall management were less happy. In London she was the proprietor of the Star Music Hall in June 1879, and of Springthorpe's (Mechanics' Hall), Grimston Street, for a week, and from 11 July 1882 to 1883 she kept the Albert Arms public house, Southwark. A more ambitious venture was the purchase of the Rainbow Music Hall (renamed the Gaiety Theatre) in Southampton in July 1884; opened in September of that year, it burnt to the ground two months later.<br>
<br>Hill entered burlesque in the 1877&#150;8 season, in <span class="italic">A Frog he would a-Wooing Go</span> (London, Aquarium). For two seasons (1878&#150;80) she took over Nelly Farren's principal-boy roles at the (London) Gaiety Theatre. Thereafter (until 1888) she became a favourite in pantomime in the northern provinces. In legitimate drama, she played Mrs Micawber to Joe Eldridge's Micawber and Nan in the revival of J. B. Buckstone's <span class="italic">Good for Nothing Nan</span> (Grecian Theatre, 1889), but with mediocre success.<br>
<br>Hill was noted for her charities and her hospitality, much of it dispensed from The Hermitage, Streatham, a bungalow on farmland whose produce she tried to hawk in London. With John Woodley she had three children: Lettie (the music-hall performer Peggy Pryde), Jenny Hill, and a boy who seems not to have survived. After Woodley's death on 8 January 1890, Hill married Edward Turnbull, a music-hall manager. By 1889 her engagements were interrupted by illness, and in December 1890 she was given a testimonial at Canterbury Hall.<br>
<br>The American vaudeville impresario Tony Pastor took Hill to New York for sixteen weeks from 23 February 1891. Despite extensive publicity, she was not appreciated by audiences, which had to be provided with glossaries of London slang. She became seriously ill in 1892 and was given a benefit at the Canterbury in September, but returned to the London Pavilion on 12 June 1893, when she introduced two new songs. She embarked on a tour of Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and Bradford, but when her doctors recommended that she not winter in England, Hill sold off the furniture of her London house, and, at the invitation of the South African manager Luscombe Searelle, went to Johannesburg in December. She could merely be wheeled onto the stage, where she shook hands with the public. She returned to London in May 1894, and moved to Bournemouth for her health. She died at Peggy Pryde's home in Brixton, London, on 28 June 1896, of pulmonary tuberculosis, and was buried in Nunhead cemetery.<br>
