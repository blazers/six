<span class="headword">Mattingly,  Harold</span>  (1884&#150;1964), <span class="occ">numismatist and ancient historian</span>, was born at Market Hill, Sudbury, Suffolk, on 24 December 1884, the son of Robert Mattingly, a clothier who became a JP and mayor of Sudbury, and his wife, Gertrude Emma Boggis. In January 1896 he went to the Leys School in Cambridge, where he concentrated on classics. In 1903 he went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, gaining firsts in both parts of the classical tripos (1906, 1907). Between 1907 and 1909 he studied under Eduard Meyer in Berlin and Ernst Fabricius in Freiburg, the research undertaken in Germany on the Roman administration being published as <span class="italic">The Imperial Civil Service</span> (1909). After returning to a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College for 1909&#150;10, he was then appointed to a post in the department of printed books in the British Museum and transferred to the department of coins and medals in 1912.<br>
<br>Mattingly's arrival in the department of coins and medals coincided with the heyday of the printed descriptive catalogue of the museum's collections; in 1873 the publication of the catalogues of the Greek coins, of notable austerity, had begun; H. A. Grueber, whose interest lay in English coinage, had been set to work on the coins of the Roman republic, publishing the catalogue in three volumes in 1910; and Mattingly was set to work on the coins of the Roman empire.<br>
<br>The traditional way of arranging the coins of the Roman republic was in alphabetical order of the names of the <i>gens</i> of the monetary magistrate responsible for an issue, with a rough attempt at chronological order of the issues of, say, the Aemillii. The coins of the Roman empire had traditionally been grouped by emperor, then arranged in alphabetical order of the reverse legends. In the case of the coins in the trays of the British Museum, the republican series had been assigned to what he believed to be the correct mints and dates by Count John de Salis between 1859 and 1869; and it is the view of those who worked in the department after Mattingly that de Salis had done the same for the bulk of the imperial series, but that Mattingly had restored much of it to the traditional arrangement. Unfortunately de Salis had left no written explanation of his criteria. In the case of the republican series, Grueber broke new ground by including in his catalogue a long introduction and very extensive annotation; much of both consists of plaintive attempts to make sense of de Salis's arrangement, which he evidently regarded as sacred. Mattingly, on the other hand, did much work on organizing the imperial series for himself. When the first volume of the catalogue, <span class="italic">Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum</span>, appeared in 1923 its introduction and notes represented his justification of his own arrangement; but the preface by G. F. Hill and occasional notes in other publications make it clear that to a large but unknowable extent Mattingly followed de Salis. On any showing, however, the volume made extraordinary progress in ordering the imperial series, and above all made the critical breakthrough of rendering the imperial series intelligible to non-specialists. The model was not replaced until the 1970s and 1980s. The briefer presentation of the coinage in the first volume of <span class="italic">Roman Imperial Coinage</span>, written in collaboration with E. A. Sydenham and also published in 1923, naturally depended on the research undertaken for the British Museum catalogue.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Mattingly served initially with the London regiment, then in the postal censorship bureau. His horror of war brought on a nervous breakdown, which was repeated in the Second World War; shortly before the end of the First World War he joined the Society of Friends. On 23 January 1915 he married Marion Grahame (1890/91&#150;1958), the daughter of John Young Meikleham, a merchant; they had a daughter and three sons.<br>
<br>The volumes of <span class="italic">Roman Imperial Coinage</span> and <span class="italic">Catalogues of the Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum</span> continued to appear throughout Mattingly's career; but an interest in the chronology of the republican series, adumbrated in an article of 1922, occupied more and more of his attention. An article of 1933, written with E. S. G. Robinson (published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the British Academy</span> for 1932), set the cat among the pigeons by dating the inception of the denarius nearly a century later than had always been believed. The article's clarity of exposition, however, was not rivalled in his later production, which also tended increasingly to resort to <i>ex cathedra</i> statements. At the same time, the later volumes of the British Museum catalogues were marked by less reading than had been apparent hitherto; his general historical work was conventional; and his attempts at economic history did not involve any significant use of comparative material.<br>
<br>Mattingly was remembered by all who knew him as a model of kindness and helpfulness; he edited the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span> from 1936 to 1952, and served as president of the Royal Numismatic Society from 1942 to 1948. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1946, and was made CBE in 1960. After retirement as an assistant keeper at the British Museum in 1948, he moved initially to Cambridge, but found little welcome, and later moved to Chesham, Buckinghamshire, where he died at his home, 9 Missenden Road, on 26 January 1964.<br>
