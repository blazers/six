<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young,  Douglas Cuthbert Colquhoun</span>  (1913&#150;1973), <span class="occ">translator and Scottish nationalist</span>, was born on 5 June 1913 at Abertay, William Street, Ferryport-on-Craig, Fife, the son of Stephen Young, a mercantile clerk, and his wife, Margaret Smart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Black. He spent part of his childhood in Bengal, speaking Urdu as a second language there. He attended Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh and graduated in classics from the University of St Andrews and New College, Oxford. His professional academic career began as an assistant in Greek at King's College, Aberdeen (1938&#150;41), where his fellow assistant was David Murison, who was to become Scotland's leading lexicographer. Later Young lectured in Latin at University College, Dundee (1947&#150;53), in Greek at St Andrews University (1953&#150;68), and then moved across the Atlantic to a post as professor of classics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario (1968&#150;70), and finally to a professorship of Greek at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1970&#150;73). Two of his many publications were on Greek subjects, <span class="italic">Chasing an Ancient Greek</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">Theognis</span> (1961). He also published verse translations from Aristophanes into Scots: <span class="italic">The Puddocks</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">The Burdies</span> (1959).<br>
<br>A very tall, striking figure, adorned with a luxuriant black beard and bright questing eyes, and an engaging personality, Young had strong political views, and was a member of both the Labour and the Scottish National (SNP) parties, serving as chair of the SNP in Aberdeen in the early 1940s. The SNP was pledged to oppose conscription, except by a Scottish government, and Young refused to register either for military service or as a conscientious objector. He served two terms in prison, reading Greek as much as possible in his cell. He contested Kirkcaldy for the SNP in 1944, winning 40 per cent of the vote, and again in 1945, when his share of the vote fell to below 20 per cent. He left the party in 1948 when the SNP banned dual membership. In 1967 he was a founder member of the 1320 Club, which sought to provide a nationalist alternative to the SNP.<br>
<br>Young was to be best remembered, however, for his promotional work in Scottish poetry, helping to build on the foundations laid by C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) and others in the years after the First World War. He contributed to periodicals such as <span class="italic">Poetry Scotland</span> in the 1940s and demonstrated that Scottish literature, especially poetry, should be seen as having strong multicultural links. He was instrumental in finding a publisher, William MacLellan, for Sorley MacLean's <span class="italic">D&agrave;in do eimhir</span> (1943), and had a hand in translating some of these Gaelic poems, later contributing Scots versions of a good many Gaelic poems by various authors. These translations, and poems translated from Greek, French, German, Lithuanian, Russian, and Chinese, as well as poems in Greek (translations of Robert Burns's poems) and Latin and French, appeared in his two collections, <span class="italic">Auntran Blads</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">A Braird o Thristles</span> (1947). In 1952 he published an anthology of Scottish poetry, <span class="italic">Scottish Verse, 1851&#150;1951</span>. Probably his work as a translator is the most enduring of his poetry, with highlights such as his translation of Paul Val&eacute;ry's &#145;La cimeti&egrave;re marin&#146; (&#145;The Kirkyaird by the Sea&#146;). His original verse has been described as &#145;an effort of the will and the intellect rather than as an unforced creative response to his experience&#146;  (A. A. H. Inglis, <span class="italic">The Penguin Companion to Literature</span>, 1971, 571), and somewhat caustically by Hugh MacDiarmid as &#145;wit-writing rather than poetry&#146;  (Kinsley, 266). For all that, there are striking lines in his original poems, for instance, his wry war-time comment:<blockquote>
<div>Instans tyrannus&#151;But och, why fash<br>
</div>
<div>for the waesome war, that doesna inspire us,<br>
</div>
<div>nae me oniewey, wi onie rowth o pleasure,<br>
</div>
<div>as weel warssle wi the Antinoe papyrus.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Auntran Blads</span>,  24)</blockquote>Douglas Young died suddenly in North Carolina, while perusing Homer, on 24 October 1973. He was survived by a wife, about whom no details are known.<br>
