<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cunningham, Sir  George</span>  (1888&#150;1963), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 23 March 1888 at Broughty Ferry, on Tayside, Forfarshire. He was the third son of a jute merchant, James Cunningham. His mother, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sandeman, died in 1892 when he was just four, and the family afterwards moved to St Andrews. He was educated at Fettes College and at Magdalen College, Oxford. He successively captained the Oxford and Scottish rugby teams, and won eight international caps in all before his entry into the Indian Civil Service and departure for the subcontinent in 1911. He served initially as an assistant commissioner in the Punjab, but most of his professional career was devoted to the north-west frontier, where he established his reputation as this volatile region's most distinguished officer since Herbert Edwardes in the mutiny period. Cunningham served his apprenticeship (1914&#150;17) as assistant to the chief commissioner, Sir George Roos-Keppel. This experience was further widened with a spell as political agent (1922&#150;3) in the tribal territories of North Waziristan. During this first period of Cunningham's career, the north-west frontier was rocked by the 1919 disturbances and the hostilities with Afghanistan, and he acquired the expertise in dealing with the delicate inter-tribal relations and defence issues which were to be the distinguishing features of his career. After a brief spell in 1925&#150;6 as counsellor at the British legation in Kabul, Cunningham was transferred to New Delhi where he spent five years as private secretary to the viceroy, Lord Irwin.<br>
<br>Serious unrest resurfaced in the north-west frontier with rioting in Peshawar on 23 April 1930. The agitation was connected with the All-India National Congress civil disobedience movement, although it had a strong local dimension and was orchestrated by the Pakhtun nationalist Khudai Khidmatgars (&#145;Servants of God&#146;). The Khudai Khidmatgar movement had been formed by Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and its members wore uniforms dyed by red brick dust and were dubbed the Red Shirts by the colonial authorities. The British repression of the disturbances was accompanied by the introduction of representative institutions with the establishment of a new legislative council in April 1932. Cunningham returned to the frontier to serve as home member. He was acting governor from November 1932 to May 1933, and later served as governor for the period 1937&#150;46.<br>
<br>The hallmark of this period was Cunningham's tact in his dealings with the Khudai Khidmatgars, who were allied with the Congress from 1931 onwards. In the later stages of the Pakistan movement, the Red Shirts' ties with the &#145;Hindu&#146; Congress in the overwhelmingly Muslim frontier appeared increasingly anomalous. They sowed the seeds for the tensions between a Pakhtun and Pakistani identity which were to surface after 1947. Cunningham initially encouraged the United Muslim Nationalists rather than the Khudai Khidmatgars, when he invited their leader, Sir Abdul Qaiyum, to form a ministry in March 1937. It survived until September, when Dr Khan Sahib formed a Congress ministry. Cunningham established a good working relationship with his ministers until their resignation in November 1939. It was his accurate reading of the decline in the frontier Congress's fortunes, however, which lay behind his restrained response to the 1942 Quit India movement. Despite the misgivings expressed in New Delhi, Cunningham's approach avoided the confrontations of the 1919&#150;20 and 1930&#150;32 periods. General Sir Claude Auchinleck indeed remarked that Cunningham's masterly handling of the Quit India campaign was worth two army corps. Cunningham however had to bow to the desire of the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, for the encouragement of a non-Congress government. Again he perceptively observed that Aurangzeb Khan's Muslim League government, which came to power in May 1943, was likely to be short-lived and beset with corruption and factionalism. Its poor performance contributed to the Muslim League's patchy results in the 1946 elections.<br>
<br>Cunningham retired to Britain in the spring of that year. His distinguished career had seen him successively appointed CIE (1925), CSI (1931), KCIE (1935), KCSI (1937), and finally, in 1946, GCIE. The following April he was installed as rector of St Andrews University, from which he had already received an honorary LLD. Within three months, however, he was back in Peshawar as governor of the frontier which had now become part of Pakistan, at the request of M. A. Jinnah, the governor-general. There could have been no greater testament to the high regard in which Cunningham's knowledge of the frontier was held. He soon found himself plunged into a political maelstrom.<br>
<br>The Muslim League had few historic roots in the frontier, but within a week of independence Dr Khan Sahib's Congress ministry had been dismissed. Abdul Ghaffar Khan's continuing championing of the Pakhtunistan demand at a time of tension with both neighbouring India and Afghanistan presented Cunningham with a major problem. He became seriously ill in the spring of 1948 and retired home on the advice of his doctors.<br>
<br>Cunningham was elected an honorary fellow of his old Oxford college in 1948. His retirement was spent at St Andrews with his devoted Irish wife, Kathleen Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Adair), whom he had married on 2 January 1929. He was elected captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, and in keeping with the sporting prowess of his youth was still able to break eighty on its demanding greens when over the age of seventy. Cunningham died suddenly, on 8 December 1963, at the Teddington home of Lady Halifax, while he was on his annual pilgrimage to the Oxford&#150;Cambridge rugby match at nearby Twickenham.<br>
<br>Sir George Cunningham was held in great respect by his colleagues, not just because of his immense knowledge and expertise, but because of his tact, imperturbability, and tolerance. He was the outstanding official of his generation in a region which was of crucial strategic importance to the Indian empire.<br>
