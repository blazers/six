<span class="headword">Philipps,  Baker</span>  (<em>c.</em>1718&#150;1745), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was a man details of whose place of birth and family are unknown. He first joined the <i>Diamond</i> in the Downs on 5 February 1734 as an able seaman, and then served in the <i>Greenwich</i> (Captain James Cornewall). In his next ship, the sloop <i>Otter</i>, he was rated midshipman, and then in the <i>Prince of Orange</i> he became master's mate, before passing for lieutenant on 27 November 1740. He did not have to wait long before being appointed sixth lieutenant of the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, and then to the <i>Kinsale</i> in home waters, a move which was followed on 20 April 1744 by his appointment as second lieutenant to the <i>Anglesea</i> (44 guns), stationed off the south coast of Ireland to protect trade. On 28 March 1745 she sailed from Kinsale, leaving her first lieutenant ashore sick. The next day she sighted a large ship to windward, which the captain, Jacob Elton, and the master wrongly supposed to be her consort, the <i>Augusta</i> (60 guns). The stranger with a fair wind, came down under a press of sail. A master's mate who was on the forecastle suddenly noted that her poop-nettings and quarter showed unmistakably French ornamentation and ran down to tell the captain. It was about two o'clock in the afternoon and he was at dinner. Thereupon the stranger, which proved to be the French ship <i>Apollon</i> (60 guns), in private employ, ran under the <i>Anglesea</i>'s stern, and poured in a heavy fire of great guns and small arms at less than a hundred yards' distance. The <i>Anglesea</i> replied as best she could, but her decks were not cleared and her fire was very feeble. Hoping to fore-reach on the Frenchman and so gain a little time, Elton set the foresail. The only effect of this was to prevent her firing her lower deck guns. The <i>Apollon</i>'s second broadside killed both Elton and the master. Philipps was left in command, and, seeing no possibility of defence, he ordered the colours to be struck.<br>
<br>The court martial which, after the return of the prisoners, examined the affair, rightly pronounced that the loss of the ship was due to Elton's over-confidence and neglect. However, it was also decided that Philipps, by not endeavouring to put the ship in order of fighting, and by not encouraging the crew to fight the <i>Apollon</i>, fell under part of the tenth article of the articles of war. The court martial had no alternative but to sentence Philipps to death, but recommended him to mercy in view of his youth and inexperience. The lords justices, to whom the case was referred, saw no reason for advising his majesty to grant mercy, and the sentence was carried out on the forecastle of the <i>Princess Royal</i> at Spithead at 11 a.m. on 19 July 1745. It is difficult to understand the grounds on which Philipps was condemned, for the ship was virtually lost before he succeeded to the command. Probably the government was alarmed by the Jacobite rising but this was not mentioned at the court martial, nor did the circumstances render this a likely explanation. It is recorded that as he met his death &#145;he behaved with great firmness and intrepidity&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 15.531). He left all to his wife, Sarah, who later remarried. Philipps's will mentions children, but does not specify their details.<br>
