<span class="headword">Wilford, Sir  James</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1517, <em>d.</em> 1550), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the only son of Thomas Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1553), landowner, of Hartridge, Kent, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1530), daughter of Walter Culpepper of Bedgebury, Kent, and his wife, Anne. His grandfather James Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1526), merchant tailor, sheriff and alderman of London, established the family's fortunes in London and Kent. Thomas Wilford, the eldest son, inherited the Kent estates and, following the death of his first wife, married Rose, daughter of William Whetenhall, of Peckham, Kent. The couple had three sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29408/', "Sir Thomas Wilford (c.1530&#150;1610)")</script>, soldier, of Heding, Kent, governor of Ostend, deputy lord lieutenant of Kent, and MP for Winchelsea, Sussex; William; and Francis, of Nonington, Kent; and a daughter, Cicely (<i>d</i>. 1611), later the wife of Edwin Sandys, archbishop of York.<br>
<br>James Wilford should not be confused with his first cousin James Wilford, of Broad Street ward, London, and Surrey, eldest son of John Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1551). The first public reference to Wilford is found for 1538, when he was considered for the post of daily waiter in the household of Sir Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's secretary. By 1542 Wilford was a servant of the king, when pardoned for an assault enacted with his lifelong friend Thomas Wyatt the younger. He was patronized by Sir John Baker, under-treasurer and chancellor of the exchequer, who was also from Kent. Wilford married Joyce (<i>d</i>. 1580), daughter of John Barrett of Aveley, Essex, by 1543. The couple had a son and two daughters. Baker and Barrett enjoyed a close friendship, cemented by family marriages. Wilford's brother-in-law, Thomas Barrett DCL (<i>d</i>. 1544), was canon of St Paul's Cathedral and a royal chaplain; his sister-in-law, Anne Barrett (<i>d</i>. 1553), married Sir Martin Bowes, under-treasurer of the royal mint and lord mayor of London from 1545 to 1546.<br>
<br>Wilford established his reputation in the wars of the late 1540s, beginning with service in the army royal at Boulogne in 1545. He declined to command at Basse Boulogne under Adrian Poynings in June 1546, but was none the less well respected. A note in the state papers for about 1547 listed him among gentlemen, &#145;whiche either for ther experyens wysdom lernyng or languages ar mete to serve in the most part of things&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 46/162, fol. 53<i>r</i>). In 1547 he was appointed provost-marshal of the army for the Scottish campaign of the lord protector, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset. On 10 September 1547 he distinguished himself at the battle of Pinkie, placing himself among the foremost of the vanguard. He was knighted on 28 September for this action. With his star on the rise, Wilford sat in the parliament that met on 4 November, representing Barnstaple, Devon, raised recruits for the army, and returned north, arriving at Newcastle upon Tyne on 12 March 1548. Placed briefly in command of Lauder, Berwickshire, in April he participated in the capture of Haddington. This town was to become the key to the English control of the lowlands, and on 28 April William Grey, thirteenth Lord Grey of Wilton, recommended Wilford for the command, informing Somerset, &#145;there is no man among us so apte for that charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1547&#150;63</i>, 111). The English occupiers worked feverishly to improve the fortifications, constructing a <i>trace italienne</i> or low-lying artillery fort, but the garrison was overlooked by high ground, victuals were scarce, and the enemy too near. On 3 June Wilford and Thomas Wyndham successfully led a sortie to capture Dalkeith, Edinburghshire, but on 26 June the French army began to move into position for a siege. Wilford's subsequent defence of Haddington, against superior, better equipped forces and in the face of desertion, chronic supply problems, and epidemic disease, was the most celebrated action of the war. The commander was short of powder, shot, victuals, money, and men, and his condemnation of English relief efforts was unremitting. On 11 December Somerset gave free rein to his own frustrations: &#145;mary we cannot but marvell that ye shuld demaunde so much as ye doo&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 50/4/120, fol. 595). Nevertheless, Wilford's defence was masterly until, early in 1549, upon leading an attack on Dunbar Castle, Haddingtonshire, he was wounded and taken prisoner. Haddington held out until the garrison was evacuated on 1 October 1549, a critical event that led to the end of hostilities in early 1550. The young captain, released on exchange, arrived at York in November in a weak state. He never recovered. Wilford was awarded the keepership of Otford Park, Kent, made steward of the manor of Gravesend, Kent, and awarded an annuity of &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. However, his will of 18 November 1550 revealed a broken constitution, &#145;very weake, feeble and sicke in bodye&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/33, sig. 28). Wilford's death was not long delayed; he died at the Crutched Friars, London, and was buried at St Bartholomew by the Exchange on 24 November. Miles Coverdale preached the funeral sermon. His widow soon after married Thomas Stanley, later an under-treasurer of the Elizabethan mint. Stanley acquired in 1553 the wardship of Sir James Wilford's only son, Thomas.<br>
