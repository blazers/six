<span class="headword">Pulton,  Ferdinando</span>  (1536&#150;1618), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born in Desborough, Northamptonshire, the son of Giles Pulton of Desborough. The Pulton family was well established in the county. Pulton matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 23 November 1552, graduated BA in 1556, and was a fellow from 25 March 1556 to 25 March 1557.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1556 Pulton was admitted a commoner at Brasenose College, Oxford. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 5 June 1559 and, although a Roman Catholic, he was called to the bar in May 1609. A legal researcher and compiler, he lived at Desborough and had a house at Bourton, near Buckingham, in addition to his quarters at Lincoln's Inn. He married Katherine (<i>d</i>. in or after 1618), with whom he had four sons&#151;Francis, Giles, Thomas, and Ferdinando&#151;and two daughters.<br>
<br>A Catholic who supported Elizabeth I and James I, his interest in theology, Roman and biblical law, and the strict execution of the criminal law allowed him to retain the critical support of James and Thomas Egerton, Baron Ellesmere, the lord chancellor. He wrote in his prefaces that the purpose of publishing the law was to educate the people in it. He believed that the criminal law must be firmly implemented and that knowledge of it would deter unlawful acts. His Catholicism affected his posthumous reputation. Two of his sons became Catholic priests, and Thomas Pulton, using the alias Underhill, was among the Jesuits discovered in March 1628 at the house of George Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury and earl of Waterford, in Clerkenwell.<br>
<br>Pulton's chief occupation was producing an edition of the statutes for publication. Robert Bowyer, clerk of parliament, and Henry Elsing, keeper of the records in the Tower of London, contracted him as the first private person to research the records of parliament. His patrons Sir William Cordell and Ellesmere gave him further assistance. Bowyer and Elsing were unhappy at seeing an outsider producing a comprehensive edition that gave the full text of statutes still in force and an abridged text of the remainder, pointing out that these had been published in their original language before. They did not believe he had the technical skill to read the old documents without their assistance and were concerned that he could disclose deficiencies in the state of the archive, including the fact that some important statutes were no longer extant. Both men were also concerned that Pulton would make money, while they went without. The situation was resolved when it was agreed that the proceeds be shared. Pulton's compilation of statute law consisted of five major works: <span class="italic">An Abstract of All the Penal Statutes which be General</span> (1577), <span class="italic">A kalender, or table, comprehending the effect of all the statutes that have been made and put in print</span> (1606), <span class="italic">Collection of Statutes Repealed and Not Repealed</span> (1608), <span class="italic">A Collection of Sundry Statutes Frequent in Use</span> (1618), and <span class="italic">The Statutes at Large</span> (1618). He was also the author of <span class="italic">De pace regis et regni</span> (1609), a major treatise on criminal offences. His literary interests included theology and medieval history, works on which were prominent in his extensive library. Shortly before his death he presented to Christ's College a copy of Robert of Gloucester's chronicle.<br>
<br>Catholicism did not curtail Pulton's life in the community. Living in both Desborough and Bourton, he acquired additional land, orchards, and mills in Buckingham, Maidstreet, and Stowe. His eldest son, Francis, was admitted to his father's inn as a gentleman in 1569, and called to the bar, but died young. Francis Pulton's sons were raised by Katherine Pulton. Ferdinando Pulton was considered a very compassionate man by the Catholic playwright and poet John Beaumont. Pulton's will provided generous allowances and bequests for his servants, for the poor of the parishes in which he held land, and to various hospitals in Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire. He made his wife his sole executor, and warned his sons to leave her in completely peaceful possession of the Bourton estate for the remainder of her life. Pulton died on 20 January 1618 in his house at Bourton. He was buried in Desborough parish church, and had a brass plate memorial erected at Bourton church.<br>
