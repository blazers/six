<span class="headword">Garner,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1415), <span class="occ">merchant and master of the mint</span>, was born in Piedmont, Italy, but had migrated to London by 1400&#150;01 where he began an eventful career as a resident alien merchant. He exported wool, for instance, on the Venetian Peter Meany's galley in 1404, and petitioned Henry IV for a seven-year monopoly of exports of block and piece tin outside the staple. Membership of the Vintners' Company enabled him to deal in Gascon wine, which he sometimes sold to the royal wardrobe; he also imported from La Rochelle, where he was represented by his brother. Extending beyond the English foothold on the continent into Spain and Portugal, his import business also included iron, Seville oil and white soap, and Portuguese fruit, wines, oxhides, and wax. These additional interests abroad were looked after by fellow Piedmontese.<br>
<br>His habitual use of Spanish boats to bring these imports north meant that Garner's goods were often intercepted by west-country and Calais-based shipmasters, even when sailing under English safe conduct. However, his royal connections enabled him to invoke the king's protection, permitting him to reclaim his belongings and bring his antagonists before the council. Notably, he petitioned with the Florentine Filippo Alberti concerning four Spanish ships which had been seized and taken to Plymouth in October 1403; Garner and Alberti were able to obtain restitution by indicating the merchants' marks to be found on their goods. But such incidents were not always resolved to Garner's satisfaction, and altogether he alleged losses worth over &pound;2000 at the hands of various English shipmasters. Even less happily, two of his employees were held to ransom at Calais; another, Peter King of London, was imprisoned and his money and goods confiscated while he was on business at Dartmouth. It may have given Garner some small satisfaction in 1404 to have brought a case in the mayor's court to recover a &pound;12 debt against Richard Spicer, MP for Portsmouth and a well-known pirate.<br>
<br>Garner was granted letters of denization, at a cost of &pound;20, on 4 March 1409, perhaps in anticipation of his appointment as keeper of the king's exchange and master of the mint in London and Calais in July of that year. However, his adoption of English nationality soon proved an unforeseen disadvantage: having sent merchandise worth &pound;4000 to Italy, he could obtain neither a return cargo nor financial compensation because of his changed allegiance, while other Italians joined forces to sue him for debt &#145;on account of the odium against him for becoming the king's liege man&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1408&#150;13</i>, 212&#150;13). Consequently, in July 1410, he sought and gained royal protection for seven years. He may also have attempted to find a short-term solution to his business problems by exploiting his position as master of the mint; a commission for his arrest was issued in March 1413 on the grounds that he had made money contrary to ordinance, and in April his offices were granted to Louis John. By May he had taken sanctuary at Westminster, apparently somewhat hastily as he left behind some of his personal property, including wine, at the Tower of London. He was pardoned two years later.<br>
<br>Garner made his will on 14 October 1415, when, as a citizen and vintner of London, he was living in the parish of St Benet Fink. Although he did not specify a place of burial, he left &pound;20 to pay for masses to be said for him at Westminster Abbey. His only other particular bequests were for masses and prayers in the city, where he gave &pound;5 to the Augustinian friars&#151;increasingly popular among the resident Italian community&#151;and &pound;2 to each of the other orders of friars. He divided the residue of his estate into third shares, according to London custom: one third went to his executors, the mercers Laurence Hampton and Thomas Bataille; one third was devoted to pious works for the welfare of his soul and those of his Italian relatives and benefactors; the remaining third was set aside to buy lands to support a perpetual chantry at Westminster Abbey, although he instructed his executors to distribute this sum in charitable works if it proved insufficient for his original purpose. Garner's will, which covered only his possessions in England, made no provision for a wife or children. His death is not recorded.<br>
