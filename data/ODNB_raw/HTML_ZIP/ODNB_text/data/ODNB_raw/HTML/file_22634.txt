<span class="headword">Poulett,  John</span>, fourth Baron and first Earl Poulett  (<em>c.</em>1668&#150;1743), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only son of John, third Baron Poulett (<i>d</i>. 1679), and his second wife, Susan, the daughter of Philip Herbert [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13042/', "Herbert, Philip, first earl of Montgomery and fourth earl of Pembroke (1584&#150;1650)")</script>]. He succeeded to the barony in 1680, but only took his seat in the Lords on 24 November 1696, when under threat of committal for non-attendance. He was a tory, and a friend and supporter of Robert Harley (afterwards earl of Oxford). By licence dated 23 April 1702 he married Bridget, the only daughter and coheir of Peregrine Bertie of Waldershare, Kent, with whom he had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>On the accession of Queen Anne Poulett was appointed lord lieutenant of Devon, and on 10 December 1702 was sworn of the privy council. He was described by Macky in 1705 as &#145;certainly one of the hopefullest Gentlemen in England; is very learned, virtuous, and a Man of Honour; much esteemed in the Country&#146;, although &#145;a mean Figure in his Person&#146; and &#145;not handsome&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 10.620). On 2 April 1706 he was elected FRS, and on 10 April he was appointed one of the commissioners to negotiate the treaty of union with Scotland. He was created Viscount Hinton St George and Earl Poulett on 24 December. From 8 August 1710 to 30 May 1711 he was first lord of the Treasury in Harley's administration, and from June 1711 to August 1714 he served as lord steward of the household. On 25 October 1712 he was elected, and on 4 August 1713 he was installed, KG.<br>
<br>Poulett seldom spoke in parliament, although he worked hard and enthusiastically as a manager between the houses, whipping up good attendances on special occasions. On 11 January 1711 he raised the issue of the reverse at Almanza, which formed the subject of the second debate on the progress of the war in Spain, and on 27 May of the following year he defended the duke of Ormond while accusing Marlborough of squandering the lives of his officers for personal gain. Marlborough challenged him to a duel, which caused him some agitation. His wife communicated the circumstance to Lord Dartmouth, who prevented the meeting by placing Poulett temporarily under arrest. He lost his places on the accession of George I, during whose reign he hardly spoke in parliament except to oppose the <span class="roman">Septennial Bill</span> on 14 April 1716 and the bill of pains and penalties against Atterbury on 15 May 1723. However, while Oxford was in the Tower following his impeachment, Poulett was instrumental in persuading certain peers to vote for his friend's acquittal.<br>
<br>During the reign of George II, Poulett lived the life of a country gentleman, but was rallied to the court party by the gift of a lord of the bedchamber's place to his eldest son, John, who entered the Lords as baron of Hinton St George on 17 January 1734. On 10 December 1742 Poulett spoke in support of the proposal to take Hanoverian troops into British pay. He died on 28 May 1743 and was buried on 3 June at Hinton St George, Somerset.<br>
