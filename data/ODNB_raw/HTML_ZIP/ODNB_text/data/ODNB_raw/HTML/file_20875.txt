<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Osborne,  Francis</span>  (1593&#150;1659), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 26 September 1593, the fifth and youngest son of Sir John Osborne (1551&#150;1628), administrator, of Chicksands Priory, Shefford, Bedfordshire, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter and coheir of Richard Barlee of Elsenham Hall, Essex. Osborne's early years were divided between Chicksands and his father's house in London; he was educated privately, &#145;bred mostly at home, not so much as in a free-school or university&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.706). He may have travelled abroad in his late teens, and refers in a later work to experiences &#145;beyond sea&#146;  (Potter, vii).<br>
<br>After going to London &#145;at ripe years&#146;, writes Wood, Osborne &#145;frequented the court, became a servant in the Pembrochian family, and at length master of the horse to that most Noble Count William earl of Pembroke&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.706). For a time he held a minor post in the office of the lord treasurer's remembrancer, the office presided over by his father and eldest brother successively. The deaths of his father in 1628 and of the third earl in 1630 probably ended his ambitions of holding public office, and his writing often reveals a tone of disappointment in his failure to obtain preferment. His earliest biographer finds no record of his subsequent career until 1641, when he &#145;ran with the times, having been puritanically educated, [and] had public employments then, and under Oliver, conferr'd upon him&#146;  (ibid.). He married Anna Draper (<i>d</i>. 1657), sister of William Draper of Nether Worton, Oxfordshire, who became a colonel in the parliamentary army, and by 1647 Osborne was a &#145;new made Justice and a Committee-man for this County&#146; as well as a parliamentary visitor for the University of Oxford  (Wood, <span class="italic">History and Antiquities</span>, 2.501, 511).<br>
<br>About 1650 Osborne removed to Oxford; Wood notes that &#145;in his last days [he] lived in Oxon purposely to print certain books of his composition that then lay by him, and to have an eye on his son John&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.706). The only son among Osborne's four children, John was registered as a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1648, and, with Draper's assistance, was installed as fellow of All Souls College in 1650, after an altercation between the parliamentary visitors at Oxford and the parliamentary committee for university business in London. By 1653, also through Draper's influence, Francis Osborne was appointed &#145;one of the seven for the countie and city of Oxon, that was a judge as to all prisons and persons committed to any prisons in comitatu vel civitate Oxon 1653&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.185). He sympathized with parliament in politics and religion. During the last eight years of his life he published a series of historical, political, and moral works, which were read widely during the Restoration and early eighteenth century. His thinking shows the influence of Hobbes, whose &#145;great acquaintance&#146; he was  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.370).<br>
<br>Osborne's son, John, received the degree of BCL in 1654 and proceeded to the Inner Temple in 1657; he married his first cousin, Elizabeth Draper, and served as prime serjeant-at-law in Ireland from 1680 until 1686. It was for John that Osborne wrote in two parts his chief publication, the <span class="italic">Advice to a Son</span>. Part 1 was issued anonymously in late 1655. Its pragmatic and apothegmatic observations appeared under the headings: &#145;Studies&#146;, &#145;Love and marriage&#146;, &#145;Travel&#146;, &#145;Government&#146;, and &#145;Religion&#146;. The work gained immediate popularity, passing through several editions in two years. In 1658 Osborne issued an enlarged edition of part 1, with his name on the title-page, and at the same time brought out a more discursive second part, inferior to the first, dedicated to Draper.<br>
<br>The book's pragmatism and cynicism may have furthered its rapid acceptance. Its frank and practical aim was to guide the reader to material success in a treacherous, self-seeking world. Popular with Oxford scholars, it enjoyed a wide readership outside the university as well. In 1658 there appeared two curious replies by London hack writers. Misogynistic passages in <span class="italic">Advice to a Son</span> ostensibly prompted the scurrilous parody, <span class="italic">Advice to a Daughter</span>, by John Heydon in 1658; as Eugenius Theodidactus, Heydon attacked Osborne as &#145;the unconquered enemy of Women&#146;  (sig. A4). Heydon was attacked in return by Thomas Pecke in <span class="italic">Advice to Balaam's Ass</span> (1658), which asserted that Heydon's book was a collection of plagiarisms. Heydon answered in a second edition of the <span class="italic">Advice to a Daughter</span> (1659), with an added section: &#145;Thomas Peck, Counsellor, examined, turn'd over the Bar and sent to Bedlam for his madness&#146;.<br>
<br>The tone of worldliness in the <span class="italic">Advice</span> contributed to Osborne's reputation for atheism. In 1658, after complaints from local ministers that the <span class="italic">Advice</span> &#145;did instil principles of Atheism into young Gentlemen&#146;, a formal complaint was brought to the vice-chancellor and a proposal put forward to have Osborne's books publicly burned  (Wood, <span class="italic">History and Antiquities</span>, 2.684). &#145;But it taking no effect&#146;, Wood records, &#145;July the 27., the vice-cancellor [Dr John Conant] caused all the booksellers to appeare before him, and commanded them not to sell any of Mr. [Francis] Osborne's booke&#146;: as might be expected, &#145;The book afterwards sold the more&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.257).<br>
<br>In later years Pepys fondly called the author &#145;my father Osborne&#146; and recorded that Sir William Petty listed the <span class="italic">Advice</span> with Browne's <span class="italic">Religio medici</span> and Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> as the works &#145;most esteemed and generally cried up for wit in the world&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 19 Oct 1661; 27 Jan 1664). Swift complained that Osborne affected phrases fashionable at court, quickly rendering his writing unintelligible  (<span class="italic">Tatler</span>, no. 230). Johnson denounced Osborne as &#145;A conceited fellow&#146;. &#145;Were a man to write so now, the boys would throw stones at him&#146;; Boswell defended his work as &#145;shrewd and lively&#146; and &#145;somewhat quaint&#146;, a book with &#145;an air of originality. We figure to ourselves an ancient gentleman talking to us&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, spring 1772).<br>
<br>After the <span class="italic">Advice</span>, Osborne is best-known for the <span class="italic">Historical Memoires of Q. Elizabeth and James I</span> (1658), reprinted in Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Secret History of the Court of James I</span> (1811). Other works include <span class="italic">A Persuasive to a Mutual Compliance under the Present Government</span> (February 1652), Osborne's contribution to the engagement controversy, dedicated to Cromwell and printed anonymously for the purpose of offering services as a secret agent; attached to it was <span class="italic">A Plea for a Free State Compared with Monarchy</span>, both reprinted by Sir Walter Scott in 1811 in <span class="italic">Scarce and Valuable Tracts &hellip; Lord Somers</span> (6.153&#150;77). Also appearing anonymously in 1652 was <span class="italic">A Seasonable Expostulation with the Netherlands</span>. Neither <span class="italic">A Persuasive</span> nor <span class="italic">A Seasonable Expostulation</span> was included in editions of Osborne's collected <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>.<br>
<br>Other works include <span class="italic">Political Reflections upon the Government of the Turks</span> (1656) and <span class="italic">Miscellany of sundry essayes, paradoxes, and problematicall discourses, letters and characters, together with politicall deductions from the history of the earl of Essex</span> (1659); the latter was dedicated to his niece, Elizabeth Draper. An unattributed, undated manuscript of a play, &#145;The True Tragicomedy&#146;, in the British Library (Add. MS 25348) may be the work of Francis Osborne.<br>
<br>Osborne's publications made him a celebrity, and he paid many visits to London; but his later life was one of straitened circumstances owing to the unhappy result of a legal battle over property. At the death of Osborne's father in 1628, the four youngest Osborne brothers inherited the North Fambridge estate in Essex, the eldest brother, Sir Peter, having received the family seat at Chicksands. Because Sir Peter fought for the king in the civil war he was fined, and he sued Francis for the North Fambridge manor. The first judgment came in favour of Sir Peter in 1653; an appeal also favoured Sir Peter's claim in March 1655, the property proceeding to his son Henry; by then Francis was the only surviving Osborne brother. Published letters place Francis at Kelvedon, Essex, in 1657; after the death of his wife, Anna, in that year he sold his remaining property and appears to have lived the rest of his life in the homes of others, with his publisher Thomas Robinson in Oxford and with William Draper at Nether Worton. He died at Draper's house on 4 February 1659 and was buried in Nether Worton chapel. His epitaph is recorded in the 1722 <span class="italic">Works</span>.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1676 Osborne's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span> (1673; 7th edn) was brought before the House of Lords as a seditious publication, apparently without consequence, for &#145;denouncing a monarchy and saying that the commonwealth is the best government&#146; (<span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, HMC; Parry, xxii). The complainant, a Captain John Seymour, and the bookseller, Samuel Mearn, were brought before a committee of the house, but no recorded result of the proceeding exists. Further editions of the <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span> were issued in 1682, 1689, 1701, and 1722, the last containing previously unpublished letters from Francis to his brother-in-law and his wife, written between 1653 and 1658, and a memoir of his life by an anonymous editor, based on Wood's account of 1691. No manuscripts in his hand remain, with the possible exception of &#145;The True Tragicomedy&#146;.<br>
