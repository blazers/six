<span class="headword">Macallum,  Hamilton</span>  (1841&#150;1896), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born at Kames, Argyll, on 21 May 1841, the second son of John Macallum JP, proprietor of the Kames gunpowder works, and his wife, Janet Hamilton. He was christened John Thomas but elected to use his mother's maiden name instead. As a boy he showed an interest in art, but this was opposed by his father who insisted on his entering a merchant's office in Glasgow, in preparation for a commercial career in India. Eventually, <i>c</i>.1864, with his father's permission, he travelled to London and entered the Royal Academy Schools. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1869 and remained a regular exhibitor there and elsewhere in London for the rest of his life. Throughout his career, Hamilton Macallum divided his life between London and his various painting grounds. For some years he had a base at Loch Fyne, Argyll, with fellow painters of the sea Colin Hunter and William McTaggart. He also sailed extensively around the edges of the western highlands of Scotland in his yacht, visited Heligoland, toured south Italy and visited Capri in 1887, and also worked extensively in south Devon from his studio at Beer.<br>
<br>Macallum enjoyed working in full daylight either in the open air or in the glass studio he erected at his home on Haverstock Hill, Hampstead. Seascapes and other water- or light-filled landscapes were his favourite subjects, for example <span class="italic">Haymaking in the Highlands</span> (1878; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum). He made a particular study of the effect of sunlight on water and achieved an extraordinary luminosity. However, his contemporaries criticized his colour as false or metallic, and at times his paintings suffered from weaknesses of composition and drawing and Macallum's overtly sentimental treatment of his figures. In 1896 Macallum exhibited <span class="italic">The Crofter's Team</span> (Tate collection) at the Royal Academy and it was acquired for the nation through the Chantrey bequest. Hamilton Macallum died suddenly of heart disease at Beer in Devon on 23 June 1896. He was survived by his widow, Euphemia Hill, daughter of John Stewart of Glasgow, and one son. She subsequently (13 March 1900) received a civil-list pension of &pound;100 per annum in consideration of her husband's merits as an artist.<br>
