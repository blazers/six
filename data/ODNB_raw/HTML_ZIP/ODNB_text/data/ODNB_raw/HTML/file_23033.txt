<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rainsford, Sir  Richard</span>  (1605&#150;1680), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born at Staverton, near Daventry, Northamptonshire, the second son of Robert Rainsford and his second wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Kirton of Thorpe Mandeville, Northamptonshire. He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 13 December 1622, but left the university before receiving a degree. On 24 May 1625 Rainsford was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar on 16 October 1632, having been elected recorder of Daventry in the interval. On 30 May 1637 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1698), daughter of Samuel Clerke, rector of St Peter's, Northampton, with whom he had eleven children. In 1653 Rainsford was elected deputy recorder of Northampton, a post he lost to a Cromwellian supporter during the protectorate.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Rainsford represented the Northampton borough in the Convention of 1660 and in Charles II's first parliament in 1661. In this capacity he delivered nine recorded speeches and was a member of thirty-two committees. He favoured increased regulation of the press, particularly unauthorized Anglican publications, supported King Charles's Worcester House declaration, and sought to scrutinize land purchases made during the interregnum. He became a serjeant-at-law on 26 October 1660, was made a knight in 1661, and was appointed a baron of the exchequer on 16 November 1663, under the tenure of Sir Matthew Hale. In 1665 Rainsford became a symbol of persecution for the Quakers, when he presided over the general quarter sessions in Northampton. After he tried many of the nonconformist religious group for refusing to take the oath of allegiance, they publicly denounced the &#145;unjust and illegal proceedings&#146; of Rainsford and his fellow judges of the exchequer  (<span class="italic">Another Outcry</span>, 1).<br>
<br>Rainsford sat in the exchequer for five years before being transferred to the king's bench on 6 February 1669. Henry Hyde, the earl of Clarendon, considered him &#145;a very extraordinary man and an excellent judge&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 309). Seven years later, when Hale resigned his post, Rainsford succeeded to the chief justiceship on 12 April 1676, despite gossip that it was he &#145;who most commonly slept on the bench&#146;  (Cromartie, 122). In his brief stint as lord chief justice, Rainsford's most significant constitutional case transpired in June 1677 after Anthony Ashley Cooper, the first earl of Shaftesbury, was imprisoned in the Tower by the House of Lords for treason. Shaftesbury claimed that the warrant to imprison him was illegal, but was denied a writ of habeas corpus. In a controversial decision, Rainsford found that the king's bench had no jurisdiction to allow a member of the House of Lords or Commons who had been sentenced and committed by parliament to be released from his sentence, even though such a writ would be valid in an ordinary tribunal. In June 1678 Rainsford was removed from office and replaced as lord chief justice by Sir William Scroggs. Whether he was dismissed for political reasons, as some biographers have suggested, or because of his age and declining health, cannot be determined (Campbell, 2.19; Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 7.157). Over the next eight months Rainsford's health deteriorated rapidly and he died on 17 February 1680 at his manor home in Dallington, Northamptonshire. Though his exact wealth at death is difficult to ascertain, he had inherited patrimonial property estimated at &pound;600 a year on the death of his elder brother in the 1650s, and on retirement he received an annuity equal to his salary. A portion of his wealth helped to found an almshouse in Northamptonshire. A monument in his honour was erected at Dallington parish church, where his remains were interred.<br>
