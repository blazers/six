<span class="headword">Vere,  John  de</span>, thirteenth earl of Oxford  (1442&#150;1513), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the second but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28213/', "John de Vere, twelfth earl of Oxford (1408&#150;1462)")</script>, and Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1410&#150;1473/4), daughter and heir of Sir John Howard. He was born on 8 September 1442.<h2>
<a name="RestorationandearlyLancastrianattachment"></a>Restoration and early Lancastrian attachment</h2>Although his father and elder brother were convicted of treason and executed in February 1462, the new earl was treated in conciliatory fashion by Edward IV. Edward granted out few of the family's estates, leaving most in the keeping of de Vere administrators, and on 18 January 1464 Earl John had licence of entry on all his father's lands, a patrimony concentrated in East Anglia and in particular in north Essex and west Suffolk; what grantees there were were compensated by the king. In the parliament of 1464 Oxford secured the reversal of the attainder of Robert de Vere, duke of Ireland and earl of Oxford (<i>d</i>. 1392), passed in 1388. (Later in life he sometimes used Robert de Vere's title of marquess of Dublin in addition to those of earl of Oxford, Viscount Bulbeck, and Lord Scales). At the coronation of Elizabeth Woodville on 26 May 1465 he was created knight of the Bath and served both as great chamberlain of England (substituting for the absent earl of Warwick) and as chamberlain to the queen.<br>
<br>Yet Oxford's loyalty to the Yorkist regime had been by no means secured. In November 1468 he was imprisoned in the Tower of London and confessed to plotting with the Lancastrians. He was probably released before 7 January and was pardoned on 15 April 1469, but by early July he had joined George, duke of Clarence, and Richard Neville, earl of Warwick (the Kingmaker) in their opposition to the king, mobilizing his retinue for the Edgcote campaign. In the autumn, as Edward regained his freedom of action, his household men showed hostility to Oxford, and in the following spring, as Warwick and Clarence rebelled again, Oxford left England for the court in exile of Margaret of Anjou. He joined the Lancastrian leaders in their meetings with Warwick and Clarence in July, and in the invasion of England in September. He landed with Clarence, Warwick, and Jasper Tudor in Devon but moved to Essex to raise troops before marching to London, where he rejoined his allies on 8 October. On 13 October he bore the sword of state before the restored Henry VI in the procession to St Paul's for a ceremonial crown-wearing, and two days later he presided at the trial of John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester. He was one of the leading lords of the readeption regime.<h2>
<a name="Flightsurrenderimprisonmentandescape"></a>Flight, surrender, imprisonment, and escape</h2>When Edward sought to invade in March 1471, Oxford prevented his landing in Norfolk, raised troops in East Anglia, and advanced to Newark. Confronted by Edward's superior forces he withdrew to Leicester, where his company was attacked and routed on 3 April. He joined Warwick at Coventry, counselled him against seeking compromise with Edward in the wake of Clarence's defection, and commanded the right wing at the battle of Barnet on 14 April. His men defeated those of Lord Hastings but fell to pillaging; when he did gather them together and return to the fight, it is reported that his badge of a mullet, or star with streams of light, was mistaken for Edward's sun in splendour and his men were shot at by their own side, causing them to cry treason and scatter. With his two brothers George and Thomas, William, Viscount Beaumont, and forty men, Oxford fled to Scotland, where he received a safe conduct on 28 April, and then to France. In the next two years he plotted with Archbishop Neville, mounted attacks on Calais, attempted a landing at St Osyth in Essex, and conducted a successful campaign of piracy from French and Scottish ports before seizing St Michael's Mount in Cornwall on 30 September 1473. There, with a force variously estimated by the chroniclers at 80 or 397 men, he was besieged, loosely at first by Sir Henry Bodrugan, then more vigorously by John Fortescue with 300 men and 4 ships. Wounded in the face by an arrow, offered pardon for his life, threatened with desertion by all but a handful of his followers, he finally surrendered on 15 February 1474, still accompanied by Beaumont and by his brothers.<br>
<br>Although he was imprisoned at Hammes Castle in the Calais pale and attainted early in 1475, Oxford remained a threat to Edward. In 1477 an impostor claiming to be the earl caused trouble in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, and in 1478 Oxford himself managed to scale the walls of Hammes Castle and leap into the moat, though contemporaries were unsure whether this was an attempt at escape or at suicide. He was if anything more dangerous to Richard III, who ordered his transfer to England on 28 October 1484, too late to prevent his escape to join Henry Tudor in the company of his gaoler James Blount. Henry was reportedly delighted to secure the services of a Lancastrian partisan of such devotion and military experience. Oxford showed his mettle at once, returning to Hammes to relieve the garrison besieged there by Lord Dynham and bringing the soldiers back to augment Tudor's forces. At Bosworth he commanded Henry's vanguard and held his ground in fierce fighting in which John Howard, duke of Norfolk, leading Richard's vanguard, was killed.<h2>
<a name="Thecountessstribulations"></a>The countess's tribulations</h2>Oxford's triumphant return brought to an end a period of great trial for his wife, Margaret Neville. She was the sixth daughter of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, and Alice Montagu, daughter and heir of the last Montagu earl of Salisbury; as sister of Warwick the Kingmaker and Archbishop Neville she presumably encouraged her husband's alliance with them. Although the earl was not attainted in 1471, his estates were confiscated and granted to Richard, duke of Gloucester, leaving Margaret completely without income: she had no inherited land, no claim to a jointure while her husband lived, and no children with land of their own. Nor could she look to her brothers for help, when two, Richard and John, were dead and the third, Archbishop George Neville, in disgrace. When she emerged from sanctuary at St Martin's-le-Grand in London, where she had taken refuge after Barnet, her prospects were so bleak that they attracted the comment of Philippe de Commines, who reported that she became dependent on charity or on what she could earn by her needle. She received some money from her husband's distant relative and her near neighbour John, Lord Howard, but from the king she had nothing but two general pardons in 1475 and 1479 until he granted her an annuity of &pound;100 during her husband's lifetime in 1482. Her sufferings did not, however, impair her vigour, to judge by her involvement in Henry VII's court or by a letter of May 1486 in which she urged Sir John Paston to cut off the escape of Viscount Lovell following his unsuccessful rebellion. Her husband's kindness to the widowed duchess of Norfolk and his co-operation over the restoration of the Howard estates by 1494 may perhaps reflect her gratitude for the Howards' kindness to her. She died between 20 November 1506 and 14 January 1507 and was buried at Colne Priory, Essex.<h2>
<a name="ZenithofpowerunderHenryVII"></a>Zenith of power under Henry VII</h2>In 1485 Oxford was immediately recognized as one of the great men of Henry VII's regime. This was evident at his arrival in London after Bosworth, when suitors flocked to petition him, and at the coronation, where he held the court of claims, having been recognized as hereditary lord great chamberlain, bore the king's train, and set the crown on Henry's head at the coronation banquet. He was appointed to significant offices: lord admiral (21 September 1485), chief steward of the duchy of Lancaster south of Trent, and constable of the Tower of London (both 22 September 1485). He was also granted various offices on the crown estates in Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk. He rapidly assumed military and political leadership in East Anglia, as the Paston letters and the records of several boroughs and of the University of Cambridge show. Many of the leaders of gentry society in Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, and Cambridgeshire were his annuitants or associates: for instance seven of the ten known knights of the shire for Suffolk between 1485 and 1504 were drawn from his circle.<br>
<br>Oxford's power rested on a landed base combining his father's lands, his mother's lands, half the Scales lands to which he had a claim through his mother, some Mowbray estates forfeited by the Howards, and other grants from the king. In 1488&#150;9 these brought him a net annual landed income of more than &pound;1400, and by 1498&#150;9 this had risen to more than &pound;1600. From 1488 he also had custody of the lands of his old companion Beaumont, who had lost his reason but lived on in Oxford's care until 1507. After 1500 Oxford and his councillors took vigorous initiatives to offset declining revenues from some of these estates, a necessary step in view of the large expenses of his household, which were running at between &pound;1400 and &pound;1500 a year in 1498/9 and 1507. The success of his financial management is attested by the &pound;2500 in ready money and goods to the value of nearly &pound;4400 inventoried at his death.<br>
<br>Oxford sat in Henry's council throughout the reign, though he was not one of the most regular attenders. By 1486 he was also a knight of the Garter. He was present at most major court occasions from the baptism of Prince Arthur in 1486, where he stood godfather, to the betrothal of Princess Mary and Charles of Habsburg in 1508. He commanded the vanguard at the battle of Stoke in 1487 and again on the invasion of France in 1492, led many troops to join Henry against the Yorkshire rebels in 1489, and began the assault on the Cornish rebels at Blackheath in 1497. He presided as lord high steward at the trial of Edward, earl of Warwick, on 21 November 1499. As lord admiral he does not seem to have been much concerned with the navy, but he did assert his rights over wrecks and king's fish. He regularly entertained Henry VII on his progresses, but Francis Bacon's story that on one of these occasions Henry imposed a vast fine upon him for gathering illegal retainers to welcome the king is probably apocryphal. Oxford lived mostly at Wivenhoe, Essex, which he had inherited from his mother, and at Castle Hedingham, Essex. At the latter he was building in brick by 1490, adding domes to the turrets of the twelfth-century keep and constructing a new great hall, several towers, a curtain wall, and a bridge across the moat. Of these only the bridge survives. Oxford's jousting helm also survives, in the Bargello Museum in Florence. He kept an outstanding chapel choir and commissioned Caxton's edition of <span class="italic">The Four Sons of Aymon</span> in 1489.<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriageanddeath"></a>Second marriage and death</h2>Oxford married his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Scrope and Eleanor Washbourne, between 28 November 1508 and 10 April 1509, following the death of her first husband, the earl's colleague Beaumont. Oxford made his testament in April 1509 as Henry VII lay dying, but survived four years into the new reign, keeping his offices and co-operating with the Howards who were rising to dominate East Anglian politics. He died at Castle Hedingham on 10 March 1513 and was buried on 24 April with his ancestors at Colne Priory, alongside his first wife in the lady chapel. Their tomb had been constructed as long before as 1488&#150;9 by Henry Lorymere of London, marbler. Oxford's alabaster effigy was still in place in 1653 but had been destroyed by 1736. Elizabeth lived until 26 June 1537, remaining active at court, and was buried with Beaumont at Wivenhoe, where their brass remains. Oxford had no children by either marriage and was succeeded by John, the son of his brother Sir George de Vere.<br>
