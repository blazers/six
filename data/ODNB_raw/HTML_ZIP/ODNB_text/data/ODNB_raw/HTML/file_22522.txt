<span class="headword">Poole,  Sophia Lane</span>  (1804&#150;1891), <span class="occ">travel writer</span>, was the youngest child of Theophilus Lane (<i>d</i>. 1814), prebendary of Withington Parva, and Sophia Gardiner. She was born at Hereford on 16 January 1804. Her elder brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15997/', "Richard James Lane")</script>, the engraver, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15990/', "Edward William Lane")</script>, the Egyptian scholar, with whom her life was particularly linked. In 1829 she married Edward Richard Poole, clergyman and miscellaneous writer, but from 1842 lived apart from him&#151;drink and debt, resulting from his over-extravagant expenditure on books, have been suggested as the explanation for their separation. In 1842 Sophia Poole and her two sons accompanied her brother Edward to Egypt, and lived in Cairo for seven years. She published an account of her experiences in <span class="italic">The Englishwoman in Egypt</span> in Knight's weekly volumes (1844 and 1846). The book was the first in English to describe from direct observation the life of Egyptian women, whose domestic life was still very largely unaffected by western influences. It created something of a sensation when readers learnt that she had dressed in Turkish trousers, taken Turkish baths with the local people and, particularly, visited some of the harems of Mehmet Ali's family&#151;although it was far from salacious, not least as it was tempered by Lane's notes and revised by him. After her return to England with her brother in 1849, she collaborated with her younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22520/', "Reginald Stuart Poole")</script>, in a series of descriptions of Francis Frith's <span class="italic">Photographic Views of Egypt, Sinai, and Palestine</span> (1860&#150;61). After the early education of her children she lived in Worthing, devoting herself to her brother Edward, until his death in 1876, and to the children of her elder son, Stanley, who were left orphaned on his death in 1867. Her last years were spent in her younger son's house at the British Museum, where she died on 6 May 1891.<br>
<br>Sophia Poole's elder son, <a name="cosubject_22512"></a><span class="headword">(Edward) Stanley Poole</span>  (1830&#150;1867), <span class="occ">Arabic scholar</span>, edited a new edition of his uncle Edward Lane's <span class="italic">Thousand and one Nights</span> (1859), and the fifth edition of <span class="italic">The Modern Egyptians</span> (1860); he also wrote many articles for Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> and contributed to the eighth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and to various periodicals. He became chief clerk of the South Kensington Department of Science and Art. He married Roberta Elizabeth Louisa, daughter of Charles Reddelien, a naturalized German. He was devoted to her and their children. His wife died in 1866 after a lingering illness and he followed soon afterwards, on 12 March 1867, leaving two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35569/', "Stanley Lane-Poole")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35568/', "Reginald Lane Poole")</script>.<br>
