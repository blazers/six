<span class="headword">King,  (Hubert) Raymond</span>  (1897&#150;1983), <span class="occ">head teacher</span>, was born at 72 Jarratt Street, Doncaster, Yorkshire, on 25 December 1897, the son of Harry King, a railway clerk, and his wife, Emily Howard. He attended King Edward VI School in East Retford, Nottinghamshire, until the age of eighteen, when he left to join the army. He served with distinction on the western front, where he was awarded the Military Medal, the Belgian Croix de Guerre, and the Distinguished Conduct Medal. He refused to be commissioned as an officer, preferring to remain among the men, but accepted the rank of temporary company sergeant-major.<br>
<br>In 1919 King entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he took a first class in part one of the historical tripos and studied English during his third year, gaining a second. After graduating in 1922 he completed a one-year teacher training course based at the Cambridge University education department and successfully submitted a thesis for the university diploma in education. He completed his teaching practice at Westminster School and, in 1923, was appointed to the staff of Portsmouth grammar school. Just three years later, at the age of twenty-eight, he was appointed headmaster of Scarborough high school, a selective grammar school, where he introduced a system of regular &#145;diligence&#146; assessments, based upon pupils' effort and improvement rather than attainment. In 1932 he moved to London to become headmaster of Wandsworth Boys' Grammar School. He was to remain at the school until his retirement in 1963. During this period, however, the character of the school dramatically changed from that of a three-form selective entry institution to one of the largest comprehensive schools in England.<br>
<br>During the 1920s and 1930s King became aware of arguments for widening access to secondary education, such as those set out in R. H. Tawney's pamphlet for the Labour Party, <span class="italic">Secondary Education for All</span> (1922), and in the 1926 Hadow report, <span class="italic">The Education of the Adolescent</span>. A number of teacher unions, including King's own association, the Incorporated Association of Head Masters, went further by challenging the principle of eleven-plus selection and supporting the establishment of secondary &#145;multilateral&#146; or &#145;comprehensive&#146; schools. For a period King kept an open mind about these questions, but during the Second World War, when the staff and boys of the Wandsworth school were evacuated to several scattered centres in the Surrey countryside, he became an active participant in many debates concerning post-war educational reconstruction. In 1942 King and three other London county council (LCC) grammar school head teachers published <span class="italic">A Democratic Reconstruction of Education</span>, a 15,000-word pamphlet, which directly led to the founding of the Conference for the Democratic Reconstruction of Education. King was the first chairman of this organization, which called for the absorption of public schools into local systems of education and the introduction of comprehensive education. The enthusiasm of the conference for comprehensive schooling was shared by another organization chaired by King, the English New Education Fellowship (ENEF). In 1950 King was the unattributed author of a widely circulated ENEF pamphlet, simply entitled <span class="italic">The Comprehensive School</span>.<br>
<br>Although in 1947 the LCC committed itself, in the London school plan, to the long-term development of a fully comprehensive system, early progress depended upon the co-operation of liberal-minded grammar school heads such as King. Acting largely on his own initiative, rather than following instructions from County Hall, King modified Wandsworth's pupil intake to include boys who had not originally been selected for a grammar school education from age eleven. After successfully absorbing a group of boys from the junior technical branch of the Brixton School of Building in 1947, a further non-grammar form was introduced in the following year. By 1955 there were three such non-selective first-year groups in addition to the cohort of boys who had entered the school as a result of passing the eleven-plus examination. In order to advance along the lines indicated in the London school plan, the LCC then announced that Wandsworth would become one of five showpiece comprehensives which had formerly been grammar schools. King relished the challenges associated with the transition to a comprehensive school and, with the support of his staff and governors, prepared for the amalgamation with a local technical school in the autumn of 1956.<br>
<br>Wandsworth comprehensive school was a vast, fifteen-form entry institution, attended by some 2130 boys. In terms of organization, like many large urban comprehensives, the lower and upper schools were located in separate buildings and a &#145;house&#146; grouping system, for which King was a great enthusiast, operated throughout the school. Predictably, after 1956 he was in great demand as a public speaker and commentator. In 1958 he joined the editorial board of <span class="italic">Forum</span>, a journal founded by Robin Pedley, Brian Simon, and Jack Walton for the purpose of promoting comprehensive education. King wrote regularly for <span class="italic">Forum</span> and in 1964, having retired from Wandsworth, he became chair of the editorial board.<br>
<br>King was also active at an international level. Before the Second World War he was an enthusiastic youth hosteller and arranged exchanges with schools in Germany and Sweden. In 1945 he represented Rotary International at a conference of UNESCO. Later he served as education adviser to the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO, and from 1947 to 1961 he chaired its textbooks sub-committee. He continued to attend European conferences into his eighties. Latterly he lived at New Malden, Surrey. King died at Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, on 21 March 1983, leaving a widow, Mary, herself an active member of the ENEF, and a son, Lionel.<br>
