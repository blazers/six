<span class="headword">Cadman <span class="st"> [Kidman]</span>,  Robert</span>  (1711/12&#150;1740), <span class="occ">ropeslider</span>, was born between 3 February 1711 and 2 February 1712, perhaps at or near Shrewsbury, Shropshire. A Robertus Cadman, son of Thomas Cadman, was baptized at Cannock, Staffordshire, on 9 September 1711. Nothing is known of his life until the 1730s, when Cadman emerged as &#145;the famed Icarus of the rope&#146;  (S. Ireland, 110), a celebrated flying man who slid down head first from some of the highest steeples and precipices in England. Balanced on a wooden breastplate grooved for the rope, blowing a trumpet and firing off pistols, the diminutive, bare-chested Cadman &#145;flew&#146; spectacularly down to earth. Behind him streamed a jet of smoke from friction of wood and hemp. This, the rapid crescendo of his act, was preceded by a variety of acrobatic stunts and mimetic antics, during which he might take an hour to climb up the rope, hanging by his toes, resting nonchalantly with arms behind his head, playing the tailor and shoemaker&#151;in view of audiences sometimes numbered in the thousands. To encourage audience participation, he called for brave volunteers.<br>
<br>Cadman appears to have travelled in company with at least one companion&#151;who circulated among the crowd, passing the hat as a collection plate&#151;and a wagon freighted with the coiled rope. A handbill circulated before one performance stated that gentlemen might, should they wish to attend, send their servants in advance with a subscription; otherwise Cadman might call upon them in person to secure the same. To supplement his &#145;take&#146;, or perhaps barter with church officials for leave to &#145;fly&#146; from their steeples, he repaired damaged weathercocks and restored fallen ones. A prelate once denied the &#145;daring adventurer&#146; permission to fly from one cathedral, replying that &#145;the man might fly <i>to</i> the church whenever he pleased, but he should never give his consent to any one's flying <i>from</i> it&#146;  (Nichols, 185).<br>
<br>Ropesliding was no new phenomenon. A Spaniard flew from St Paul's Cathedral at Edward VI's coronation, and a man (who received only the promise of a patent for his &#145;invention&#146;) flew during the procession of James I through Grantham. More conventional funambulists entertained crowds at fairs throughout the country and in London, where Cadman was a &#145;constant exhibiter&#146;  (Rimbault, 161) and apparently once flew from St Martin-in-the-Fields, but the 1730s witnessed a flying craze: &#145;No amusement was seen but the rope; walls, posts, trees, and houses, were mounted for the pleasure of flying down: if a straggling scaffold pole could be found, it was reared for the convenience of flying&#146;  (Hutton, 205).<br>
<br>The charismatic Cadman triumphed at Derby in October 1732, in what may be his first identifiable performance, climbing the rope once and flying down twice on each of three consecutive days from the top of All Saints' steeple. He was probably the &#145;flying man&#146; who on 9 September 1732 at Cambridge &#145;flew down from the Top of St Mary's Steeple upon the Shambles&#146; and, one week later, the disappointed showman who &#145;fix'd his Rope to the Top of Chesterton Steeple, and had like to have pulled Part of it down; so they would not let him proceed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 22 Sept 1732). Presumably, however, he was not the &#145;sailor&#146; who in London flew from Lambeth Tower to the Feathers alehouse; from the Monument to the Three Tuns tavern in Gracechurch Street; and from Greenwich church, suffering injuries that encouraged false reports of his death.<br>
<br>It is not certain whether William Hogarth, in his painting and engraving <span class="italic">Southwark Fair</span> (1733), intended to depict Cadman&#151;rather than his predecessor, the Italian flyer Signor Violante&#151;in the figure flying headlong from the tower of St George the Martyr, but Cadman's posthumous reputation encouraged the association. In 1735 at Bromham, Wiltshire, Cadman earned notoriety when he brought down the steeple, suffering only minor injuries when he crashed into a tree. By 1736 Cadman had eclipsed Violante. The <span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span> (15 April 1736) noted that &#145;Robert Kidman, the famous Flyer, who has flown from several of the highest Precipices in England&#146;, flew on 12 April from the highest point of St Vincent's Rocks near Bristol, over the River Severn &#145;with Fireworks and Pistols&#146;, a feat executed eight years earlier by Signor Violante. In 1739 he descended to the Black Boy public house from a spire of Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>During the great frost of the winter of 1740 Cadman and a woman called his wife appeared at Shrewsbury to restore the church's damaged weathercock. A handbill dated 24 January heralded his flight on 2 February from St Mary's steeple over the Severn to the meadow opposite. It was later said that &#145;just before he set out on his mad career, he found the rope a little too tight, and gave the signal to slacken it: but that the persons employed, misconceiving his meaning, drew it tighter. It snapped in two as he was passing over St Mary's Friars, and he fell amid thousands of spectators &hellip; the body, after reaching the earth, rebounded upwards several feet&#146;, the severed rope smoking in its serpentine descent. His wife, who had been passing round the hat, &#145;threw away her money in an agony of grief&#146;  (Owen and Blakeway, 410) and ran to him, but<blockquote>
<div>Nothing could ought avail but limbs of brass,<br>
</div>
<div>When ground was iron, and the <i>Severn</i> glass.<br>
</div> (J. A., ll. 38&#150;9)</blockquote>The <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span> (7 Feb 1740) reported that Cadman was killed &#145;by the cutting off of the Rope where it came through the Steeple, it being fasten'd to the Frames of the Bells&#146;.<br>
<br>Cadman was buried beneath the steeple at St Mary's, Shrewsbury, on 4 February 1740, commemorated by a ten-line epitaph. His cold, dramatic death cemented his reputation and ended the golden age of flying. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> rushed to press a mock-heroic yet sympathetic poem by &#145;J. A.&#146;, presumably an eyewitness, who likened Cadman to Icarus, Arachne, and Ovid's Phaeton&#151;<i>Magnis tamen excidit ausis</i> (&#145;yet he fell in a great undertaking&#146;)&#151;in verses that record vivid details of his final flight.<br>
<br>Recklessness played its part in Cadman's catastrophe. &#145;He was a very extraordinary Fellow in his Way, but was grown too daring; for notwithstanding he was frequently caution'd by People here, he would not be prevail'd on so much as to set any thing between the Rope and the Stone to prevent it cutting off&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, 7 Feb 1740). Once, having drunk too much in company after restoring the weathercock at Hanslope church, Buckinghamshire, Cadman discovered he had left atop the spire the drum he beat before terrified onlookers while at his task, and, claiming it might be stolen in the night, could scarcely be restrained from climbing up again to fetch it down. Such antics of a man &#145;seemingly composed of spirit and gristle&#146;  (Hutton, 203) heightened the fascination, awe, and incredulity that Cadman sparked and suggest why beneath his epitaph someone once appended the couplet:<blockquote>
<div>Good-night, good-night, poor [ROBERT] CADMAN,<br>
</div>
<div>You lived and died just like a madman.<br>
</div> (Loaring, 185)</blockquote>
