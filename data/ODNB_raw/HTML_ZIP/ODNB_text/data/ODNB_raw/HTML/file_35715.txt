<span class="headword">Reid, Sir  George Houstoun</span>  (1845&#150;1918), <span class="occ">prime minister of Australia</span>, was born at the manse, Johnstone, near Paisley, Renfrew, on 25 February 1845, the fifth of the seven children of John Reid (1800&#150;1867), a Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Marion, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crybbace (1809?&#150;1885). In 1852 the family emigrated to Victoria. Reid attended the Melbourne Academy until 1858, when he moved with his parents to Sydney. After some time in a merchant's office he became a clerk in the public service, and by the age of twenty held a responsible position in the treasury. By 1879, when he was admitted to the bar, he was permanent head of the attorney-general's department. He had also published several works on intercolonial problems, on the colony's resources, and fiscal policy, of which the most significant was <span class="italic">An Essay on New South Wales, the Mother Colony of the Australias</span> (1876). In 1880 he was elected to the New South Wales legislative assembly, and in 1883 he became minister of public instruction. Unseated on a technicality in 1884, he was again returned the following year, to represent the same area in colonial and federal politics for a generation.<br>
<br>Between 1885 and 1891 Reid was often irregular in his attendance, devoting his time to building up a lucrative legal practice and enjoying an active social life: he thrice declined office under Sir Henry Parkes. When Parkes made a dramatic gesture towards federating the Australian colonies, Reid, suspecting that it would involve a threat to the free-trade policy of New South Wales, was the principal advocate of caution. After a draft constitution was drawn up in 1891 he strongly criticized its illiberal elements, and the movement temporarily petered out. This marked a turning point in his life. He became more active politically, and on 5 November 1891, to the surprise of his bachelor friends, he married Flora Ann, the daughter of John and Suzannah Brumby of Longford, Tasmania, who was twenty-four years his junior. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>The government fell shortly afterwards, and when Parkes resigned his leadership of the Free Trade Party, Reid, rather unexpectedly, succeeded him. His effective criticism of the new government's protectionism, and his success in putting forward an alternative policy based on direct taxation, won him a resounding electoral victory in 1894, confirmed the following year after a crisis brought about by the upper house. As premier he reshaped the colony's finances, made significant reforms in other areas, and managed the nascent Labor Party very well. He also took up the federal question, which was, after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of 1891, being pushed by Edmund Barton. Reid convened the premiers' conference which led to the convention in 1897&#150;8 and worked very hard as a delegate. During an adjournment he visited London for the diamond jubilee and the colonial conference. He was sworn of the privy council and entrusted with the Colonial Office's views on the draft constitution. But he was very disappointed at the outcome of the intercolonial bargaining, seeing some of the provisions of the final draft as disadvantageous to his colony, others as potentially undemocratic. He announced his personal intention of voting &#145;yes&#146; in the referendum on its acceptance in 1898, but his frank criticisms led to its narrow defeat in New South Wales (the critical colony) on 3 June 1898. There followed further negotiations which resulted in substantial improvements, and its endorsement the following June; but the more enthusiastic federalists had already branded him as a fence-sitter, &#145;Yes&#150;No Reid&#146;, and took part in an intrigue which cost him both the premiership of his colony and the first federal prime ministership.<br>
<br>Reid entered federal politics as acknowledged leader of the opposition, but under serious disadvantages. With parliament meeting in Melbourne and his practice, at which he could earn at least ten times his parliamentary stipend, centred in Sydney, he was forced to leave much work to his deputy. Remaining a convinced free-trader, he nevertheless became convinced that the fiscal issue should be compromised in the face of the rise of the Labor Party, which he condemned, rather misleadingly, as &#145;socialist&#146;: his real objections were those of a liberal to the Labor Party's rigid caucus system. The confused political situation produced by the existence of three almost equal parties in the second parliament made Reid prime minister in a coalition from August 1904 to July 1905, but the &#145;fusion&#146; of the old Free-Trade and Protectionist parties which he advocated did not come until 1909, when he stepped aside to make co-operation between his followers and those of Alfred Deakin (a late convert to the idea) possible. His appointment as first high commissioner in London later in 1909 was in part a reward. He formally held the post from 1910.<br>
<br>Aided by his strong sympathy with English Liberalism, Reid made a great success of what he saw as the primary task: an indefatigable trencherman, with a wit to match his vast waistcoat, he was in constant demand as an after-dinner speaker. On these as well as more formal occasions he let no opportunity pass to emphasize the advantages his country offered to investors and potential emigrants. He travelled widely and built up an efficient office organization to support his efforts. The outbreak of war widened his responsibilities greatly.<br>
<br>Disappointed when he failed to get his term extended beyond January 1916, Reid was delighted to be returned, without opposition, to the House of Commons. In the winter of 1917&#150;18 he undertook a strenuous semi-official speaking tour of the United States in support of the war effort. He had little time to make a mark in the house, though he did help to defuse an embarrassing resolution on the government's Irish policy. He died suddenly of cerebral thrombosis at his home, 1 Melbury Road, Prince's Gardens, London, on 13 September 1918 and was buried at Putney Vale cemetery on 18 September after a service at St Columba's Church of Scotland, Pont Street. He had been appointed KCMG (1909), GCMG (1911), and GCB (1916). In 1917 his wife had been appointed DBE for her efforts on behalf of wounded servicemen.<br>
<br>Ludicrous obesity, a walrus moustache, thin, sandy hair, and an unruly monocle made Reid a cartoonists' delight. The caricature has often, wrongly, been confused with the man. He was in fact a clever politician, an efficient premier, and a very successful high commissioner; and no one did more to ensure that Australia's federal constitution should be both liberal and workable.<br>
