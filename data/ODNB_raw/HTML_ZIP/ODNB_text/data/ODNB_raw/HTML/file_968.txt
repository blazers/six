<span class="headword">Babington,  Benjamin Guy</span>  (1794&#150;1866), <span class="occ">physician and orientalist</span>, the fourth son of the physician and mineralogist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/977/', "William Babington (1756&#150;1833)")</script> and his wife, Martha Elizabeth Babington, was born on 5 March 1794 in Guy's Hospital when his father was resident apothecary there. Educated at Charterhouse School from 1803 to 1807, he entered the navy as a midshipman and served at Walcheren and Copenhagen, but left the service early, and, having obtained a nomination for the Indian Civil Service, studied at the East India College, Haileybury; he was appointed to the Madras presidency in 1812. Babington possessed an aptitude for languages and soon became distinguished as an oriental scholar. He translated into English <span class="italic">A grammar of the high dialect of the Tamil language, termed Shen-Tamil: to which is added an introduction to Tamil poetry by the Reverend Father C. J. Beschi. Translated from the original Latin</span> (1822), and published other translations, including <span class="italic">The Ved&agrave;la Cadai, being the Tamul Version of a Collection of Ancient Tales in Sanscrit</span> (1831). His marriage in 1816 to Anna Maria, daughter of Benjamin Fayle, brought them three sons before her early death.<br>
<br>Babington's health suffered in India, and he returned to England in 1819 to study medicine at Guy's Hospital and Cambridge. After matriculating at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1820, at the age of twenty-five, and already a widower with a family, he became MB in 1825, ML in 1827, and MD in 1830. In 1831 he was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, where he was censor and Croonian lecturer in 1841. He became assistant physician to Guy's Hospital in 1837, and full physician in 1840. Babington was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1828 and in 1861 president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He was the founder, and for some years the president, of the Epidemiological Society, and was appointed by the crown a member of the medical council of the General Board of Health. He was also physician to the Deaf and Dumb Hospital, and to other charities.<br>
<br>Babington was a man of remarkable intellectual power; proficient in several sciences, he was exact and thorough in all of them. In a lecture to the Hunterian Society on 18 March 1829 Babington demonstrated an ingenious instrument intended to allow the physician to examine the parts of the throat which were normally invisible. The instrument, which he proposed to call the glottiscope, consisted of an oblong piece of mirror fastened to a long piece of silver wire. With the patient's tongue held down by a spatula and the mirror placed against the palate, the epiglottis and upper part of the larynx became visible in the mirror. Babington's device, now known as the laryngoscope, was made public twenty-six years earlier than that of Manuel Garc&iacute;a, a Spanish singing teacher long credited with its invention.<br>
<br>Soon after his appointment at Guy's Hospital Babington studied animal chemistry, and assisted Astley Cooper, Richard Bright, and other colleagues in analysing morbid products. He also wrote in the <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span> two papers on the blood, in one of which he described the fat constantly present in the serum; in another he employed for the first time the term &#145;liquor sanguinis&#146; to denote the fluid portion of the blood. He wrote some more strictly medical papers in <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span>. He translated from the German J. F. C. Hecker's <span class="italic">Epidemics of the Middle Ages</span> (1844), and edited a translation of Ernst von Feuchtersleben's <span class="italic">Principles of Medical Psychology</span> for the Sydenham Society (1847).<br>
<br>Babington was highly regarded by his colleagues, but he hardly enjoyed the public reputation or gained the success which might have been expected. This was partly due to his retiring and unambitious character and partly, perhaps, to his having entered medicine somewhat late in life.<br>
<br>Babington resigned his appointments at Guy's Hospital in 1855, and died at his home, 31 George Street, Hanover Square, London, on 8 April 1866.<br>
