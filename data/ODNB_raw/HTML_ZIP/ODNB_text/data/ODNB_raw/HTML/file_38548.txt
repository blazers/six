<span class="headword">Dorn,  Marion V.</span>  (1896&#150;1964), <span class="occ">designer</span>, was born on 25 December 1896, probably at Menlo Park, near San Francisco, California, one of five children of Diodemus Socrates Dorn (1860&#150;1913), lawyer, and Camille Johnson (1870&#150;1932). Educated at Stanford University from 1912 to 1916 (bachelor of arts in graphic arts, Phi Beta Kappa), thereafter she shared a studio in Russian Hill, San Francisco, with her former tutor, the artist Henry Varnum Poor (1887&#150;1970), her husband from July 1919 to 20 October 1923. Early in 1919 they moved to New City, New York, and Dorn gained notice as a designer of batiks. In Paris in 1923 she met the poster designer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38951/', "Edward McKnight Kauffer (1890&#150;1954)")</script>, and subsequently resided with him at 17 John Street, The Adelphi, London, from late 1923 to 1931, at Swan Court, Chelsea, from 1931 to 1 July 1940, and in New York until his death in 1954; they lived at 40 Central Park South from about 1942, and married in 1950. Dorn's New York studio was at 54th Street and Madison Avenue.<br>
<br>Dorn's career was launched in Britain in the mid to late 1920s, when she maintained her graphic work and hand production of batik scarves, curtains, and decorative panels, while extending her practice to include interiors and rugs, the latter initiated about 1926. In the 1930s she ceased making batiks, instead having woven and printed fabrics made by Jean Orage, Edinburgh Weavers, and Warner &amp; Sons Ltd. The latter two, especially Warners, also purchased her designs for their own production. Equally reciprocal was her association with the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory from 1928, resulting in the 1930s in over a hundred designs for hand-knotted carpets, some for Dorn's own clients&#151;among them the Savoy hotel group (including Claridges Hotel, the Berkeley Hotel, and the Savoy, 1931&#150;9) and the Cunard, Orient, and Shaw Saville ocean liner companies (1934&#150;9). Her rugs were conceived and marketed as limited-edition fine art productions, and for these she became best known, being dubbed &#145;the architect of floors&#146; in 1932. In 1933 she joined a Wilton Royal Carpet Factory sub-committee to select modern designs for the firm's production, having turned down an invitation to become a director. In 1934 she formed a design consultancy, Marion Dorn Ltd, through which she completed interior design schemes, organized the production of fabrics, wallpapers, and furniture, and undertook book illustrations and graphic and textile designs. In addition, for her own clients machine-made carpets were also commissioned to supplement those hand-knotted for her by several firms other than Wiltons.<br>
<br>From 1927 to 1939 Dorn's work was exhibited in many influential European exhibitions including those at Dorland Hall, London (1933 and 1934), Burlington House, London (1935), and the Universal Exhibition, Paris (1937). Exports to and exhibitions in the United States from 1929 to 1939, including at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (1937), and the Golden Gate International Exposition, San Francisco (1939), maintained exposure there for her work in her absence. After returning to New York she worked with at least thirteen firms, including wallpaper manufacturer Basset and Vollum and textile manufacturers A. H. Lee, Goodall Fabrics, Jofa Inc., Mitchell-David, F. Schumacher &amp; Co., and Silkar Studios; longer and more fruitful associations were with Greeff Fabrics Inc. (1956&#150;64), who exported her fabrics to Britain through Warners; the wallpaper manufacturer Katenbach and Warren (<i>c</i>.1947&#150;59); and the hand gun-tufted rug and carpet manufacturer Edward Fields Inc., producing over a hundred designs (1949&#150;62).<br>
<br>Known for her good looks and humour, Dorn was an astute self-publicist able to attract a fashionable clientele and collaborators&#151;from No&euml;l Coward to Graham Sutherland, who exhibited ceramics in Dorn's showroom in 1939&#151;and to grasp the technical requirements of rug and fabric production. In 1957 she received an honorary fellowship of the British Society of Industrial Artists for her outstanding contribution to textile design; the society's journal recorded that &#145;her masterly drawing and her unerring sense of pattern, colour and texture contributed to a result that had an immense and lasting influence on textiles in this country as well as abroad&#146;  (Hunter). She made a significant contribution to British modern interiors independently and in collaboration with architects such as Oliver Hill, Robert Lutyens, Serge Chermayeff, Eric Mendelsohn, Wells Coates, and Brian O'Rorke, and interior decorators such as Syrie Maugham, designing the cream rug in the widely illustrated &#145;all white&#146; drawing room in Maugham's London flat (1933). Designs for moquette seating fabric for the London Passenger Transport Board (<i>c</i>.1937) were still being rewoven in 1954 and remained in London Underground carriages for another decade or so. Her printed textile designs with casually placed areas of colour over outlined motifs, well-suiting the then new commercial technique of hand-screen printing, shaped stylistic trends from <i>c</i>.1935 to 1960. For Fields she made continued developments, promoting textured and boldly patterned floor coverings and the concept of &#145;area rugs&#146;; with them she completed her last major commission (1960), the carpet for the diplomatic reception room at the White House, Washington, DC. She retired to Tangier, Morocco, in 1962, where she died on 28 January 1964 and was buried. Examples of her printed textiles are in the Gallery of Costume, Manchester, and the Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
