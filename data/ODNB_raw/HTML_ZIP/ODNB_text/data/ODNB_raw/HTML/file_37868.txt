<span class="headword">Prophete,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1350&#150;1416), <span class="occ">dean of York and administrator</span>, was Welsh by birth, from the diocese of St David's, and probably from Carmarthenshire, but he had family ties across the border, especially with the Prophetes, Plowfields, and Hores around Hereford and the Felds of Ombersley, Worcestershire, all in the lower strata of county society. His nephew, Thomas Feld DCL, lived and worked with his uncle and aspired shamelessly to his cast-off offices and preferments. Their wills catalogue the family.<br>
<br>Prophete was a chief trustee to the heretic and rebel Sir John Oldcastle (<i>d</i>. 1417) and also his kinsman, probably through Katherine ferch Richard ab Ieuan, Oldcastle's first wife. He also did business with another heretic, Sir John Cheyne of Beckford (<i>d</i>. 1414), but no suspicion ever fell upon himself. Probably educated at Oxford, he had become a notary public by July 1376, and in that capacity he followed William Courtenay, bishop of Hereford (1369&#150;75), to London (1375&#150;81), where he recorded the controversial &#145;confession&#146; of the rebel John Ball in 1381, and to Canterbury, where he served as registrar of the provincial court from 19 February 1382 to 18 November 1384, and thereafter as secretary, trusted adjutant, and friend until Courtenay died in 1396. When the archbishop, by rank rather than enthusiasm, headed the reform commission imposed on Richard II in 1386, Prophete was seconded to the king's household as a watchdog. After Richard's critics moved against the king and his friends in 1387&#150;8, Prophete was assigned to service the proceedings of the council through which Richard II was now obliged to work. Although formally designated as a clerk of the privy seal (1389) and the holder of the office of secondary there (1394), his status and duties had only nominal connections with that place of drudgery. By 1392 he was formally &#145;clerk of the council&#146; and had, by shrewd organization of its records, contributed greatly to its claims to political authority. Richard II recognized this by his brusque dismissal of Prophete in 1395.<br>
<br>Prophete spent his exile in and around his deanery of Hereford until, after the revolution of 1399, he was recalled at once to become one of the most active attenders on the royal council, doubtless to contribute bureaucratic flair to a government badly needing to prove its administrative competence. In 1402 he even acted briefly as secretary to Henry IV. On 4 October 1406, when Henry's government was at its nadir, he finally became keeper of the privy seal. There he remained through nearly nine years of sharp ministerial changes, an unprecedented term, perhaps indicative of a unique standing in the civil service, but also of lack of personal political influence.<br>
<br>To his nephew's bitterness and despair, Prophete never gained the bishopric that customarily ended the keeper's term. By Prophete's own analysis this was because he would not stoop to intriguing for one on his own account. Possibly his several masters thought him indispensable or, less graciously, simply a workhorse. But he held such a plurality of rich benefices already (reckoned at &pound;750&#150;&pound;900 p.a.) that, with his &pound;100 salary on top, only certain bishoprics were worth considering: by chance, next to none of these fell vacant in his time, and those that did were too politically important to fall to him.<br>
<br>Between 1378 and 1407 Prophete enjoyed thirty-five benefices (although never more than twelve at once). In his heartlands of Hereford (where he was dean) and Wales, he was Trollopian in touch, and a generous kinsman. A letter-book (BL, MS Harley 431) may not be his compilation, but is the memorial to his intrigues. Yet, after becoming dean of York in 1406 he did one more reshuffle of his holdings, then never changed them again. Did such brokerage seem ill-becoming to one in great office? On 3 June 1415 (as Henry V was leaving for France) he resigned, just when his licence for absenteeism from his deanship of York ran out. None the less, it was in London that he made his will on 8 April 1416, characteristically dedicated to his kin, staff, and domestic servants. To them he gave detailed care, now as always: most had been with him for many years. At some point affection had crept in on both sides. Similarly, Prophete still had a shrewd and not unaffectionate eye on his several scattered preferments. He had always been willing to spend on them. With Archbishop Courtenay long dead there was no one from a greater world to consider. He died before the end of April 1416 and was buried in Ringwood, Hampshire, in accordance with his directions to be buried there should he die within the province of Canterbury.<br>
