<span class="headword">O'Leary,  Ellen</span>  (1831&#150;1889), <span class="occ">poet and Irish nationalist</span>, was born on 23 October 1831 at 16 West Main Street, Tipperary, the second child of John O'Leary (<i>d</i>. 1848), shopkeeper and landlord, and his second wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ryan. Her elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35302/', "John O'Leary (1830&#150;1907)")</script>, and she also had a younger brother, Arthur (1833&#150;1861). Margaret O'Leary died in the mid-1830s and this affected Ellen O'Leary severely. Her father remarried and had a third family, and an aunt, who helped to rear her and her brothers, encouraged nationalist feelings in the children.<br>
<br>Ellen O'Leary contributed patriotic ballads and songs to the Young Ireland paper, <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, then to her brother's Fenian paper, the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>, writing as Eily and Lenel. She also contributed to the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>, <span class="italic">The Shamrock</span>, and <span class="italic">The Irishman</span>. She was closely involved in the affairs of the Irish Republican Brotherhood of which her brother John was a prominent member; in 1864 she handled Irish Republican Brotherhood funds in her brother's absence and in 1866 she raised &pound;200 on her house property in Tipperary, to help finance James Stephens's escape to France. When John O'Leary was tried for treason-felony in 1865, she sat by the dock and she visited him during his five years in Portland prison. On O'Leary's return to Ireland from exile in Paris in 1885 she came to live with him at 40 Leinster Road, Dublin: brother and sister became the centre of a cultural and nationalist circle which included W. B. Yeats, to whom she had a maternal attitude, Maud Gonne, Rose Kavanagh, Rosa Mulholland, Dora Sigerson, and Katharine Tynan. Yeats recalled her as being, like her brother:<blockquote>of Plutarch's people. She told me of her brother's life, of the foundation of the Fenian movement, and of the arrests that followed (I believe that her own sweetheart had somehow fallen among the wreckage), of sentences of death pronounced upon false evidence amid a public panic, and told it all without bitterness. No fanaticism could thrive amid such gentleness. She never found it hard to believe that an opponent had as high a motive as her own, and needed upon her difficult road no spur of hate. (Yeats, <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 95)</blockquote>In the early 1880s Ellen O'Leary developed breast cancer. John O'Leary remained unaware of her illness and was abroad when she died at 9 Castle Street, Cork, on 15 October 1889, while on a visit to a nephew. She was buried in Tipperary. O'Leary was devastated, writing to Yeats: &#145;A horrible calamity has come, and the light of my life has gone out&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters of W. B. Yeats</span>, 1.192). O'Leary later summed up their relationship: &#145;She was everything to me as I was everything to her&#146;  (O'Leary, 2.97). In his <span class="italic">Boston Pilot</span> obituary Yeats described her verse as having &#145;mingled austerity and tenderness &hellip; like a rivulet flowing from mountain snows&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Letters to the New Island</span>, 25). Her <span class="italic">Lays of Country, Home and Friends</span>, with some verses by Arthur O'Leary appended, was published in 1890 with prefatory material by T. W. Rolleston and Sir Charles Gavan Duffy. Yeats selected four poems by Ellen O'Leary for <span class="italic">The Poets and the Poetry of the Century</span>  (Miles), emphasizing the traditional nature of her verse and its closeness to popular sentiment, recalling that her songs had been sung in the streets of Tipperary &#145;by the ballad-singers from their little strips of fluttering paper&#146;  (p. 449). Yeats included her &#145;To God and Ireland True&#146; in his <span class="italic">A Book of Irish Verse</span> (1895). Ellen O'Leary is not represented in <span class="italic">The New Spirit of the Nation</span> (ed. Martin MacDermott, 1894), presumably because her best political verse was given to the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>, yet poems such as &#145;The Felon's Last Wish&#146; compare favourably with verse by Eva (Mary Kelly) or Mary (Ellen Downing).<br>
