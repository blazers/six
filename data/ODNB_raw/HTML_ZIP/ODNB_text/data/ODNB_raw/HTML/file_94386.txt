<span class="headword">Pease,  (Rendel) Sebastian <span class="st"> [Bas]</span></span>  (1922&#150;2004), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born at 9 Brunswick Walk, Cambridge, on 2 November 1922, the son of Michael Stewart Pease (<i>d</i>. 1966), geneticist, later director of poultry research in the school of agriculture, University of Cambridge, and his wife, Helen Bowen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wedgwood (1895&#150;1981), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36812/', "Josiah Clement Wedgwood, first Baron Wedgwood")</script>, politician, a cabinet minister in the first Labour government. On both sides of his family the links with the Labour Party were strong: his paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35445/', "Edward Reynolds Pease")</script>, one of the founders of the Fabian Society.<br>
<br>Pease was educated at Bedales School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read physics and was chairman of the Labour Club. Forced to curtail his studies by the Second World War, from 1942 to 1946 he served as a scientific officer in the operational research service at RAF Bomber Command, High Wycombe, where he worked on navigation equipment. He returned to Cambridge in 1946 to complete his physics degree, and the following year took up a post as scientific officer at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell. On 9 August 1952 he married the 21-year-old Susan Spickernell (<i>d</i>. 1996), daughter of Sir Frank Todd Spickernell, naval officer; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>At Harwell Pease carried out research into radiation damage to the structure of solids, and published a paper with George Kinchin in 1955 that remained a key to damage mechanism analysis for decades. When it became possible to use beams of neutrons to study solids in a way analogous to their study by X-rays, and using the fact that they are scattered by hydrogen atoms, which are invisible to X-rays, Pease had also, in collaboration with George Bacon, by 1952 completed another seminal study elucidating the role of hydrogen atoms in potassium di-hydrogen phosphate as the origin of its piezoelectric power.<br>
<br>In 1961 Pease moved to the Culham Laboratory for Plasma Physics and Nuclear Fusion, as division head. In 1967 he became the assistant director of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority research group. The following year he became director of the Culham Laboratory, and in 1981 the programme director for fusion, a post he held until his retirement in 1987.<br>
<br>In 1957 Pease had first been offered the chance to work in the field of fusion, where atoms of hydrogen isotopes are forced together to form helium and release energy&#151;the process at the heart of the hydrogen bomb and the source of the power of the sun. The possibility of making a device to release this energy on a useable scale had engaged the interest of several groups of researchers since the Second World War, mostly in universities at first. When it was realized that the physics involved overlapped to some extent with the science of weapon development, all the work was pooled into two groups under the Atomic Energy Authority, where it was classified as secret. However, in 1958 the major powers all presented papers on their work at the &#145;Atoms for peace&#146; conference in Geneva. The problem with fusion was to maintain a body of gas big enough, dense enough, and hot enough to sustain the reactions. Experiments up to 1958 had shown that current apparatus was too small to reach all of these conditions simultaneously, though projects like the Zeta (zero energy toroidal assembly) experiment at Harwell, which Pease had led, showed that the toroidal configuration known as the Tokamak, developed by the Russians, could produce discharges lasting many milliseconds.<br>
<br>In 1957 Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community) formed a fusion research committee in Brussels that gave financial support for specific major projects at the national fusion laboratories. Although the UK was not yet a member of Euratom, Pease was permitted to attend its meetings. At Culham he proposed a twenty-year plan culminating in the construction of a prototype electricity-generating device. This plan was too ambitious for the Atomic Energy Authority. A similar discussion in Euratom led to the conclusion that a multinational project was needed. Then, in 1973, the UK was admitted to Euratom and so joined the fusion research committee formally. Pease enthusiastically supported this scheme for a multinational project. It was largely due to his efforts that agreement was reached to set up a team under Paul-Henri Rebut to design the joint European torus (JET). With typical flair, Pease offered accommodation and full general support to site the team at Culham. This was accepted and the design group arrived at Culham in 1973. A satisfactory design was tabled by 1976 but the selection of a site for its construction was difficult. After much discussion, the choice was narrowed to Germany or Britain. In October 1977 the UK helped Lufthansa to rescue the German plane and passengers that had been hijacked at Mogadishu and, in a moment of gratitude, the Germans conceded that JET should be constructed at Culham. The construction went ahead on a site adjacent to Culham, with many support services provided from Culham until JET built its own infrastructure. Pease had to balance this support with his own duty as director of the fusion programme within the Atomic Energy Authority, still a substantial research effort involving lines of work not necessarily allied to JET. He accomplished this with his usual flair and charm.<br>
<br>Pease received many honours, including honorary degrees from Surrey, Aston, and City universities. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1977, and was a member of the Royal Society's group that in 1998 produced an influential report on the management of separated plutonium. He was active in several other learned societies, and from 1978 to 1980 was president of the Institute of Physics. A lifelong Labour supporter and a member of the Fabian Society from 1942, he was also a committed member of the Pugwash movement (urging limits to the spread of nuclear weapons while advocating the civilian use of nuclear energy), chairing its British group from 1988 to 2002.<br>
<br>Pease was a man of boundless energy, fertile imagination, and charm, all coupled with a determination bordering on rebelliousness at times. He and his first wife, Susan, lived a full and happy life, sharing their passion for music until, after some forty-four years together, Susan died. On 4 April 1998 Pease married Jean Frances White, a sixty-year-old retired personnel officer (and daughter of John Trentham White, also a personnel officer), who brought him happiness for a short time but died herself less than two years later. His last years were spent in the company of Eleanor Mary Barnes, a retired social worker (and daughter of John Robert Spray, company executive); they married on 22 March 2004, when she was aged sixty-nine. Throughout the last ten years of his life, Pease also had the loving and unstinting support of his children. He died at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 17 October 2004, of necrotizing fasciitis and cancer of the oesophagus. He was survived by his third wife, Eleanor, and the five children of his first marriage.<br>
