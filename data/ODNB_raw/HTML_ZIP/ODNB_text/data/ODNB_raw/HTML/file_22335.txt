<span class="headword">Pitt,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Camelford  (1737&#150;1793), <span class="occ">politician and dilettante</span>, was born and baptized at Boconnoc, Cornwall, on 3 March 1737, the only surviving son in the family of two sons and two daughters of Thomas Pitt (<i>c</i>.1705&#150;1761), MP and lord warden of the stannaries, and his wife, Christian (<i>c</i>.1710&#150;1750), the daughter of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, fourth baronet, of Hagley, Worcestershire.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Following a rift between his parents, Pitt was schooled at Marylebone, Middlesex, from 1744. From 1751 he fell under the aegis of his father's as yet childless brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22337/', "William Pitt, later earl of Chatham")</script>, whose admonitory letters to him on his studies and behaviour were published in 1804. His uncle encouraged him to part from his tyrannical father, who wished him to accompany him, with his sisters, into a debtor's exile on the continent. Pitt refused and, financed by William Pitt and his maternal uncle Sir Richard Lyttelton, who sent him to Brighton to improve his faltering health, he matriculated from Clare College, Cambridge, in 1754. He resided in college until 1758, and took his MA <i>per literas regias</i> in 1759, when his father returned from abroad. After dramatic scenes with his irate and desperate father, he agreed to pay the latter's debts and settle &pound;5000 each on his sisters by cutting the entail on his prospective inheritance, a settlement that incurred his uncle Pitt's disapproval. Seeking to mend his health and shattered nerves in a warmer climate, Pitt set off in the train of Lord Kinnoull, appointed ambassador to Portugal, in February 1760. His companions were Lord Strathmore and Philip Francis. They were at Lisbon from March to May, and proceeded through Spain to Italy. Pitt described his travels to the poet Thomas Gray and wrote a detailed journal of them, which is extant in the British Library. He stayed with his uncle Sir Richard Lyttelton and with Sir Horace Mann, who escorted him to the Uffizi in Florence, and he also visited Venice and Rome. News of his father's death on 17 July 1761, only three weeks after his marriage to his second wife, Maria Murray, reached him in August at San Casciano. Reluctantly he proceeded home, after a long delay caused by his failure to secure a French passport in wartime; while he waited he visited Naples. He returned to England via Germany in December 1761 and duly cut off the entail. His memoir of &#145;Family characters and anecdotes&#146;, written for his son in 1781, reveals his abiding dislike for his father's pugnacious temper and unforgivable mistreatment of his mother.<h2>
<a name="Politicalallegiances"></a>Political allegiances</h2>As part of his inheritance Pitt became parliamentary patron of Old Sarum and, to a large extent, of Okehampton. He sat as MP first for Old Sarum from December 1761 to 1768, and then for Okehampton from 1774 to 1784. When the duke of Newcastle reminded him that his father had promised to surrender to him the seat he first occupied in parliament, he retorted that he was not bound by this, and that his payment of his father's debts was conditional on his obtaining the seat. As it was, he had sacrificed his father's interest in Bodmin and Lostwithiel boroughs and failed in an application to succeed him as lord warden of the stannaries. At first he supported Lord Bute, but soon wavered. He joined the faction led by his first cousin once removed, George Grenville, who, on becoming prime minister, placed him at the Admiralty board in April 1763. His attachment to Grenville further estranged him from his uncle Pitt and alienated his neighbour Horace Walpole, who was outraged at his and Grenville's attempt to secure the allegiance of Walpole's beloved cousin General Henry Seymour Conway. This was followed by a storm in a teacup in March 1764 over the election for high steward of Cambridge University, when Pitt withheld his anticipated vote for Lord Sandwich, who was narrowly defeated. Nevertheless, he began to make his mark in debate, seconding the address ably in January 1765.<br>
<br>Pitt resigned his place with Grenville in August 1765, though the new premier, Rockingham, in deference to his uncle Pitt, would have allowed him to stay put, and his name was at first inserted in the new commission. His stance became clear when he spoke and voted against the repeal of Grenville's <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. In 1766 he refused office, even though his uncle Pitt, now earl of Chatham, was the mainstay of the duke of Grafton's administration: instead he visited France. His adherence was still to Grenville, whom he reconciled to his Pitt relatives in 1768. Although he disliked the populist tendencies of the radical John Wilkes, and voted against him on 2 February 1769, he joined Grenville the next day in speaking and voting against Wilkes's expulsion, and on 17 March he contradicted the house's right to declare Wilkes ineligible to sit in the Commons. He joined the Thatched House tavern celebration of the Westminster electors' freedom on 9 May, but was reproached in the press for his sale of the two seats for Old Sarum, one to a government supporter.<h2>
<a name="Retreatfromparliamentmarriageandtravel"></a>Retreat from parliament, marriage, and travel</h2>Grenville's death in November 1770 left Pitt leaderless, and he became politically less attentive (he visited France again in 1771) and more independent, although as late as 25 February 1774 he sought to make Grenville's <span class="roman">Election Act</span> permanent. He supported the Feathers tavern petitioners in their attempt to end the requirement for university students at Oxford and Cambridge to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> in order to graduate or become ordinands. In March 1772 he opposed both government and opposition on the <span class="roman">Royal Marriages Bill</span>, which he ridiculed. He himself had married, on 29 July 1771, Anne (1738&#150;1803), the daughter and coheir of Pinckney Wilkinson, a London merchant, of Burnham, Norfolk. She brought a dowry of &pound;30,000 and as much again in expectation, and Pitt returned Wilkinson, as well as himself, to parliament as members for Old Sarum in 1774. The marriage produced a daughter, Anne (1772&#150;1864), the future wife of the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11501/', "William Wyndham Grenville (1759&#150;1834)")</script>, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22336/', "Thomas Pitt, later second Baron Camelford (1775&#150;1804)")</script>.<br>
<br>Having in 1774 reconciled his kinsmen lords Chatham and Temple, who had long been estranged, Pitt did not attend parliament until 17 February 1778, when, after referring pointedly to his absence, he declared himself favourable to peace with America; a month later he supported the removal of Lord North's ministry. He did not join the opposition, however, but acted as an intermediary in a failed bid to recruit Chatham for the ministry in March 1778. Chatham's death dismayed him and, crippled suddenly with arthritis, he took his family to Italy in September, staying at Florence and Naples.<h2>
<a name="Politicalrejuvenation"></a>Political rejuvenation</h2>On his return to England early in 1780 Pitt seemed prepared to take on Chatham's mantle. He reappeared in the Commons in April to support Dunning's motion deploring the baleful influence of the crown and bitterly assailed Lord North as a harbinger of national decline, a theme to which he returned repeatedly. He supported motions against the war in America and unsuccessfully called for a halt to supply on 30 November 1781. When North's ministry fell he became more active in debate and moved for a statement of government finance since 1776. The reformist schemes of his young cousin William Pitt perplexed him, however. Though he supported the disenfranchisement of revenue officers on 16 April 1782, he opposed William Pitt's attack on pocket boroughs on 7 May, regarding them as the best shield, in the hands of propertied magnates (such as himself), against the influence of the crown. He preferred Chatham's notion of increasing the number of county seats. When, on 7 May 1783, Pitt proposed adding 100 of these, he thought the figure excessive, especially as there was a concomitant reduction of borough seats; he was willing to sacrifice Old Sarum, regarded as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of pocket boroughs, as it had no resident voters. It was at this point that Sir Nathaniel Wraxall described him as &#145;a very plausible speaker &hellip; [who] had a seductive species of querulous eloquence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 3.67). Pitt was less sympathetic to Charles James Fox's reformist schemes, and, though he seconded Fox's motion to secure the independence of the Irish parliament on 17 May 1782, he distanced himself from Fox's argument; furthermore, on 18 December he obviated a motion of Fox's without consulting the ministry. On 17 February 1783 he moved the address on Shelburne's peace bid and denounced Fox's coalition with Lord North to obtain power.<br>
<br>When Shelburne's ministry fell, Pitt was suddenly the man of the moment, and unfit for it. The king, rather than acquiesce in the Fox&#150;North coalition, cast about for an alternative, and offered him, through Lord Gower, the Home Office and the lead in the Commons. Pitt declined, and advised the king to approach Fox and North, but without concealing his aversion to their coalition. The king failed to persuade him to reconsider high office at the end of March, and could see that his health was not up to it. Pitt steadfastly opposed the coalition, attacking their <span class="roman">East India Bill</span> on 20 November 1783 and their objection to royal interference on 17 December. When Pitt's cousin William became premier, he at once was offered, as head of the family, a peerage; after obtaining an alteration to the title first proposed, he was created Baron Camelford on 5 January 1784. He encouraged his cousin not to take his early setbacks in the Commons to heart, and in the Lords gave him his support, other than on two occasions: on the ministry's bid, in August 1784, to extract a statement of their profits from nabobs returning from India, and in 1785 on the proposed parliamentary reform. Fox and Edmund Burke made fun of him in the Commons, and he was mocked in the opposition satire <span class="italic">Rolliad</span>. His last speeches in the Lords, in 1786, were critical of the proposals of his kinsman Lord Stanhope to reduce the national debt. In 1789 he was prepared, though his offer was refused, to provide financial support for the premier, whose widowed mother he had already helped out. Instead he invested unwisely in an attempt, through a local agent, to restore his family's parliamentary interest in the borough of Bodmin.<h2>
<a name="Adilettantelife"></a>A dilettante life</h2>Throughout his life Camelford took a deep and informed interest in the arts. In March 1762 he embellished a small house in Twickenham, wittily dubbing it the Palazzo Pitti. He thus became a neighbour, by choice or persuasion, and surely not by chance, of Horace Walpole, who had described him in February 1760 as &#145;not only a most ingenious young man, but also a most amiable one&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 21.364). He impressed Walpole as a kindred spirit, both of them being finical if not effeminate, with the bonus of a keen interest in gothick architecture. He provided Walpole with designs for interior features at Strawberry Hill, and on 1 May 1763 joined the Dilettanti Society. In that year he probably designed a gothick cottage, bridge of rocks, and conservatory for Henry Seymour Conway at Park Place near Henley. Following his political quarrel with Walpole, whom he tried hard to conciliate, he left Twickenham in 1764. He designed the wainscoting for cathedral stalls at Carlisle, where his uncle Charles Lyttelton was then bishop; the Palladian bridge at Hagley, Worcestershire, for another uncle, George, first Baron Lyttelton; and the Corinthian arch for his kinsman Earl Temple at Stowe. At Boconnoc, where his father's financial ruin had left him only books and china, wasted gardens, and no timber, he restocked the domicile and designed and built a second wing as a family portrait gallery. In 1771 he erected an obelisk in the restored grounds to the memory of his uncle Sir Richard Lyttelton. His London home, Camelford House at the top of Park Lane, its front at 16 Oxford Street, was built that year, probably to his design. In 1778 Horace Walpole magnanimously recommended him to Earl Harcourt to design the gothick portion of a monument to his late father. That year he had secured family permission for a death mask of Lord Chatham to be taken by the sculptor Joseph Wilton.<br>
<br>In 1779 Pitt purchased the lease of Petersham Lodge, the grounds of which were eventually, following the lodge's demolition, to be included in Richmond Park, Surrey. He bought it in fee simple from the crown by an act of 1784. In 1790 he sold the lodge to the duke of Clarence. In 1785 he failed to persuade the Society of Dilettanti to complete the building, which he had begun, of two adjoining houses in Hertford Street, for a public museum. White clay on his Cornish estate furnished material for the Plymouth porcelain factory of Richard Champion, which he patronized, although its fierce competitor, the Wedgwood pottery factory at Etruria, made Pitt's portrait medallion. He also befriended Thomas Mudge in his attempts to improve nautical chronometers, and the artists John Soane, whom he met in Rome, and Angelica Kauffmann. While in Rome in 1788 he took up the cause of British artists there who despaired of sending their works home because of high import duties. He monitored and presented to his cousin William Pitt their petition concocted by the medallist Nathaniel Marchant, which procured some exemption for them.<br>
<br>Camelford was more tentative in literary matters, and was not ambitious of publication, though he may have been the author of sundry anonymous ephemera, a habit of his which Horace Walpole attributed to George Grenville's example. Sir John Sinclair ascribed to him a <span class="italic">Letter to the Author</span> of his <span class="italic">Lucubrations</span> of 1782, in which the writer maintained that open parliamentary boroughs were far more corrupt than pocket ones. Burke adjudged him the author in January 1784 of a pamphlet on the constitutional right of the Commons to advise the sovereign, and mockingly accredited him with another of the year before in which he had decried parliamentary reform; possibly this was the reply to Sinclair. He was reputedly the author of a tract about the American War of Independence and denied publishing a pamphlet on the French Revolution in 1789. What is undoubtedly his is a sad reflection of his family vicissitudes: in 1785 he published <span class="italic">Narrative and Proofs</span> of the misconduct of his brother-in-law Captain John Smith, who had married Mary Wilkinson in 1760. After she had been disowned by his father, Camelford had generously sustained Mary and her family during the collapse of her marriage, which he had tried to repair in 1772. Smith nevertheless obtained an annuity of &pound;200 from him in a lawsuit.<br>
<br>Camelford's declining years were spent chiefly abroad, in Italy, and, after a month's sojourn at home in 1791, in Brussels, where he frequented counter-revolutionary circles and befriended the widow of Charles James Stuart, the countess of Albany. However, he fled Brussels in November 1792 and returned to Italy. He died in Florence on 19 January 1793 and was buried at Boconnoc on 2 March.<br>
