</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marochetti,  (Pietro) Carlo Giovanni Battista</span>, Baron Marochetti in the nobility of Sardinia  (1805&#150;1867), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 14 January 1805 in Turin, the son of Vincenzo (Vincent) Marochetti (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1768), a former priest who had served as secretary-general to the provisional republican Piedmontese government and was professor of eloquence at Turin University and under-prefect of Chivasso, and his wife, whose maiden surname was Isola. With the waning of Napoleonic influence in the area Vincenzo Marochetti moved with his family to France, where he practised as an advocate in the Paris court of cassation. Carlo Marochetti was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Napol&eacute;on and went on to study sculpture at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts under Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph Bosio. His one attempt at the <i>prix de Rome</i> of the &Eacute;cole was rewarded only with an honourable mention, but since his mother was resident in Rome, having returned to Italy about 1814, he was enabled, without state assistance, to pass lengthy periods there between 1822 and 1827. In Rome his contacts were with other French students, such as Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph Duret and Antoine Etex. He is also reported to have spent time in the studio of Bertel Thorvaldsen, the celebrated Danish sculptor. For all his neo-classical training, Marochetti increasingly identified, after the July Revolution of 1830, with the Romantic school of sculpture, pursuing on the one hand a colourful historicism, and on the other, sartorial realism in contemporary portraiture, accompanied sometimes by a lively textured treatment of surfaces.<br>
<br>Following his move back to Paris, Marochetti married in 1835 Camille de Maussion (<i>d</i>. 1893); they had two sons and a daughter. Two major commissions were given to him by the new constitutional monarchy, a relief of the battle of Jemappes for the Arc de Triomphe de l'&Eacute;toile, and a colossal group, <span class="italic">The Elevation of Mary Magdalene</span>, for the high altar of the church of La Madeleine in Paris. Completion of the latter was delayed by work on a monument which would win for Marochetti a contested celebrity as a creator of lively equestrian statues. This was the historical portrait of Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy (1528&#150;1580), fully armed, in the act of sheathing his sword while reining in his charger. Marochetti made a gift of this statue to his birthplace, but before its erection in the piazza San Carlo in Turin it was temporarily exhibited in the courtyard of the Louvre in 1838. The support of Louis-Philippe and his family which this privilege denoted was further demonstrated when Marochetti was asked to execute an equestrian statue of Ferdinand, duke of Orl&eacute;ans, after the duke's accidental death in 1842. One version stood between 1844 and 1848 in the Louvre courtyard. Marochetti was also an early contributor to the wave of commemorative sculpture, which this period witnessed, to great men of the nation in the places of their birth.<br>
<br>Tireless in his search for new arenas for public statuary, Marochetti in 1840 was simultaneously attempting to secure a commission in Glasgow for a monument to the duke of Wellington, and also preparing models for the tomb of Napoleon I for the church of Les Invalides in Paris. He was ultimately successful in his bid for the Glasgow statue, which would be inaugurated in 1844, but the commission of one who was seen as both unqualified and foreign as the sculptor of so national a memorial as Napoleon's tomb inspired a storm of protest in France. Relieved of the tomb memorial, Marochetti was appeased with another related commission for an equestrian statue of the emperor for the esplanade of the Invalides. This statue, though modelled by Marochetti, remained at his country house at Vaux-sur-Seine, outside Paris, until the commission was finally annulled by the government of Napoleon III in 1853.<br>
<br>Following the abdication of Louis-Philippe in 1848, Marochetti remained briefly in France. Having been mayor of Vaux since 1846, he now campaigned for election as its deputy to the new republican national assembly. When this and other projects failed he moved permanently to London late in 1848. He already had influential contacts in Britain. In 1849 he met Queen Victoria and Prince Albert for the first time, impressing the queen, who found him &#145;very agreeable, gentlemanlike and unassuming&#146;  (Queen Victoria, journal, 1 July 1848, Royal Archives, Windsor). Quite soon he established his reputation with the plaster equestrian statue of Richard I, which stood outside the western entrance to the Crystal Palace in 1851. A group of supporters campaigned for the statue's erection in bronze &#145;on some conspicuous site in the metropolis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proposal for the Erection of the Statue of Richard Coeur de Lion by Baron Marochetti, 23 May 1853</span>). Prince Albert was responsible for the decision to place it outside the Palace of Westminster, where it has stood since 1860.<br>
<br>Despite the support of the royal couple and John Ruskin, Marochetti met with a chauvinistic reaction to his admittedly far-reaching ambitions. Hoping to circumvent competition for the tomb of the duke of Wellington, in 1859 he exhibited a seated figure of a <span class="roman">Winged Victory</span>, part of his proposed monument, in the garden of Apsley House, London, overlooking Rotten Row, and tried to muster royal support for his scheme. In this he failed, as he did also in a project of the early 1860s for a series of statues in St Margaret's churchyard, Westminster, commemorating a triumvirate of great engineers. These statues were later erected in different locations (that of Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the Victoria Embankment, George Stephenson at Euston Station, and Joseph Locke in Locke Park, Barnsley, Yorkshire). A colossal statue of Sir Robert Peel in Parliament Square was also later removed, to be replaced by a smaller figure by Matthew Noble. As a reporter for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> observed, Marochetti appeared to be aiming at hegemony in the heartlands of Westminster  (&#145;Fine art gossip&#146;, 29 June 1861, 867). Despite these reverses, his vast studio and foundry in the mews behind his home, 34 Onslow Square, South Kensington, were always full of work in progress. The two forms which dominated his production in these years were equestrian statues (Queen Victoria and Prince Albert for Glasgow, Viscount Combermere for Chester, Sir Mark Cubbon for Bangalore, India) and monumental mourning seraphim, deployed in individual or group commemorations (the monument to the lords Melbourne in St Paul's Cathedral, London; the monument to British soldiers killed in the Crimea, known as the Scutari obelisk, in Haydarpa&#351;a cemetery, Turkey; and the Cawnpore memorial in Cawnpore, India). While living in England, Marochetti produced important monuments for Italy (those of Carlo Alberto of Savoy for Turin, and Gioacchino Rossini for Pesaro) and for France (the tomb of the comtesse de Lariboisi&egrave;re for the H&ocirc;pital Lariboisi&egrave;re in Paris).<br>
<br>Marochetti followed in the footsteps of the sculptor John Gibson in his promotion of sculptural polychromy. His most spectacular excursion in this line was a coloured marble statuette of Queen Victoria as &#145;Queen of Peace&#146;, exhibited in the Bayswater studios of the society photographer Camille Silvy in 1862 (lost; photograph, National Portrait Gallery, London).<br>
<br>On the death of Prince Albert in 1861, Queen Victoria chose Marochetti to execute the private monument to the prince and herself for the Royal Mausoleum at Frogmore, in Windsor Great Park. This tomb, with its four kneeling bronze angels, is one of his finest achievements. He seems to have had less success with the seated figure of the prince, designed as centrepiece for the national memorial for Kensington Gardens in London. His second model had just been completed when he himself died, and the queen deemed the portrait figure unworthy of the monument. A new statue was commissioned from the Irish sculptor John Henry Foley.<br>
<br>Marochetti died suddenly at Passy, near Paris, on 29 December 1867 and was buried in the cemetery of Vaux-sur-Seine. The elder of his two sons, Maurizio (Maurice) Marochetti, entered the Italian diplomatic service but also practised as a sculptor.<br>
