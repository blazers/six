</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tomline, Sir  George  Pretyman</span>, fifth baronet  (1750&#150;1827), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester and political adviser</span>, was born George Pretyman at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 9 October 1750, the eldest son of George Pretyman (1722&#150;1810), landowner and wool dealer, and his wife, Susan (1720/21&#150;1807), daughter of John Hubbard of Bury St Edmunds. A family document claims that the Pretyman pedigree can be traced back to 1362  (Suffolk RO, HA119/T108/45/19), and the family had owned land in Suffolk for many generations. Pretyman's father served as one of the capital burgesses of the corporation of Bury St Edmunds.<br>
<br>The young Pretyman was educated at Bury St Edmunds grammar school and matriculated from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1768. His mathematical abilities were recognized by the award of the Smith prize and by his status as senior wrangler. He graduated BA in 1772 and MA in 1775. He became a fellow of Pembroke in 1773, and was ordained deacon in the diocese of Norwich on 14 August 1774 and priest in the diocese of Peterborough two years later. When William Pitt the younger was sent as an undergraduate to Pembroke at the age of fourteen, Pretyman became his tutor, confidant, and friend, thus establishing the connection to which, as he frequently admitted, he owed his advancement in the church. He continued to play a part in university affairs, and assisted Pitt in his unsuccessful candidature for the university constituency in the general election of 1780. He served as university moderator in 1781. In 1782 he secured his first ecclesiastical preferment, the sinecure rectory of Corwen, Merioneth. Further preferment rapidly followed. In 1784 he was made a canon of Westminster and was created DD by Cambridge; in 1785 he became rector of Sudbourn-cum-Offord and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>The appointment of Pitt as prime minister in December 1783 and his success in the general election the following spring gave Pretyman access to political influence. Pitt appointed him to what was in effect the post of private secretary, although he avoided use of that term lest it hinder Pretyman's career in the church. &#145;Mr Pitt has given me very good Apartments in his house, where I am to eat, drink &amp; sleep just as I please&#146;, wrote Pretyman  (n.d., Tomline MS, HA119/T108/45/25). Pitt made full use of his mathematical skills, seeking his advice as to the details of financial policy, notably the sinking fund. Pretyman secured his reward when at the age of thirty-six he became bishop of Lincoln. Pitt had to overcome the resistance of George III, who regarded Pretyman's elevation as a party appointment. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> subsequently repeated the familiar story that the king declared of Pretyman: &#145;Too young, too young&#151;can't have it!&#146; but that when Pitt replied, &#145;Oh, but please your Majesty, had it not been for Dr P. I should not have been in the office I now hold&#146;, the king yielded: &#145;He shall have it, Pitt&#151;he shall have it, Pitt!&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 201). He was consecrated on 11 March 1787 and in the same month was installed as dean of St Paul's. Although Pretyman no longer resided at Downing Street after moving to the bishop's residence at Buckden Palace, Huntingdonshire, he remained on terms of the closest friendship with Pitt, who frequently wrote to &#145;my dear bishop&#146; to solicit his counsel about senior ecclesiastical appointments. According to George Rose, the secretary to the Treasury, who knew both men well, Pretyman's advice weighed heavily with his patron.<br>
<br>Pretyman married, on 3 September 1784, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1826), eldest daughter of Thomas Maltby of Germains, Buckinghamshire; they had three sons. Elizabeth Pretyman's intellectual gifts are evident in her letters to her husband and he took her fully into his confidence over ecclesiastical and political matters. His letters to her form a valuable commentary on significant aspects of public life. After dining with some of his clergy during one of his regular three-yearly visitations, he confided to his wife: &#145;these public dinners and suppers are dreadful things&#146;  (n.d., Tomline MS, HA119/T108/45/1). He was none the less a conscientious diocesan, who conducted eleven visitations during his thirty-three years as bishop of Lincoln. His obituarist tactfully observed: &#145;Though to the inferior clergy there was unquestionably something over-awing in his presence, arising from their conscientiousness of his superior attainments, yet it was impossible not to admire the courtliness of his manners and the benevolence of his sentiments&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 204). He was a loyal, albeit usually silent, supporter of Pitt's ministry in the House of Lords, although duties in his large diocese frequently kept him from London. However, he frequently visited Pitt and was accordingly well informed on public affairs, including the regency crisis of 1788&#150;9. In 1789, preaching the 30 January sermon before the House of Lords, Pretyman showed that he shared Pitt's whiggish opinions by denouncing Charles I and praising those who had resisted him. During the late 1790s he advised Pitt over war finance and proposals for reform of the tithe laws. In 1800 he played an important part in devising Pitt's abortive &#145;ecclesiastical plan&#146; which featured a scheme to augment clerical livings and to introduce a revised system of episcopal jurisdiction.<br>
<br>Pretyman strongly deplored Pitt's resignation in March 1801 and disagreed with his patron's willingness to countenance Catholic emancipation as a concomitant of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> with Ireland. He disapproved of Addington's administration and on more than one occasion urged a reluctant Pitt to return to office. He began to evince a severe anti-Catholicism, warning Pitt to avoid provoking the king by demanding full liberty to enact Catholic emancipation. Pretyman told Pitt in February 1801 that &#145;in thinking of the Cath. of Ireland he was not to forget the Protestants of England&#151;that there was still, &amp; ought to be, a great Prejudice in this Country against Popery&#146;  (Tomline MS, HA119/T108/45/1). His personal friendship with Pitt was unaffected by this difference of policy and in 1801 he took a tactful lead in raising a subscription among Pitt's friends for the relief of the latter's debts; he himself contributed &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Pretyman was already a man of financial substance and in 1803 his family fortune was consolidated when, apparently to his surprise, he inherited a mansion house and a large estate at Riby in Lincolnshire from Marmaduke Tomline. The latter was not a blood relation, and Pretyman estimated that he had not met him more than five or six times. He exulted to his wife that this new property was &#145;worth two thousand pounds a year!!&#146;  (23 June 1803, Tomline MS, HA119/T108/45/1). From this time he took the name Tomline. A further bequest from James Hayes in 1821 brought him several farms in Suffolk which had previously belonged to the Pretyman family.<br>
<br>Until the later 1790s Pretyman had not been noted as a theologian. However, in 1799 he published his two-volume <span class="italic">Elements of Christian Theology</span>, a work dedicated to Pitt and designed for Anglican ordinands. Its lucidity and accessibility earned it considerable popularity and it reached a twelfth edition in 1818. Several reprints and abridgements were made subsequently and the <span class="italic">Elements</span> remained in print well into the second half of the nineteenth century. He endeavoured to repudiate the Calvinist interpretation of article 17, arguing that God gave man free agency to accept or reject His offer of salvation and that He foresaw who would accept and who would reject the offer. This, he claimed, was the only sense in which predestination could be reconciled with the attributes of a loving deity. A pamphlet based on this section of the <span class="italic">Elements</span> appeared in 1822 under the title <span class="italic">A Scriptural Exposition of the Seventeenth Article</span>. Armed with something approaching a scholarly reputation, Tomline was a serious candidate for the archbishopric of Canterbury on the death of John Moore on 18 January 1805. Pitt had returned to office in 1804 after the renewal of war with France and the dissolution of Addington's ministry. Although he had previously made a tentative agreement with George III that the primacy should be conferred upon Charles Manners-Sutton, bishop of Norwich, Pitt vigorously promoted Tomline's case. The king, however, viewed Pitt's advocacy as importunity, suspected a threat to one of his remaining prerogatives, and insisted on retaining the presentation in his own hands. The ultimate appointment of Manners-Sutton led Pitt to consider resignation and was a bitter disappointment to Tomline and to his wife.<br>
<br>Tomline was present during Pitt's last days in January 1806 and attended him on his deathbed; after his death Tomline took on the role of custodian of his memory. He preached a eulogistic memorial sermon and undertook Pitt's biography. The result was a two-volume work published in 1821 that took the story to 1793; second and third editions in three volumes followed in the same year. Tomline was heavily criticized in several reviews for an excessive dependence on published sources; he also exaggerated Pitt's devotion to the Church of England. His account of Charles James Fox's questionable conduct at the time of the Anglo-Russian negotiations of 1791 involved him in a prolonged controversy with Fox's friend Robert Adair. Although Tomline compiled a further volume, it was never published, apparently as a result of the strictures directed against its predecessors. Pitt's death had removed him from political influence; he respected Lord Grenville but did not share his pro-Catholic sympathies and was relieved at the dismissal of Grenville's &#145;Talents&#146; ministry in March 1807.<br>
<br>Tomline returned to theological writing and in 1811 he consolidated and extended the message of many of the charges to his clergy in <span class="italic">A Refutation of Calvinism</span>. He assembled a formidable collection of quotations from the fathers to demonstrate their opposition to Calvinist doctrines and, in chapter 6, argued from detailed evidence that the opinions of many heretics resembled Calvinism. He concluded: &#145;Our Church is not Lutheran&#151;it is not Calvinistic&#151;it is not Arminian&#151;It is Scriptural: it is built upon the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone&#146;  (3rd edn, 1811, 590). The <span class="italic">Refutation</span> achieved considerable success, reaching an eighth edition in 1823, and provoked replies of a high quality, notably from Thomas Scott. In 1812 Tomline strongly denounced the Catholic claims, asserting that &#145;Protestantism is an essential part of the British Constitution&#146;  (G. Tomline, <span class="italic">A Charge Delivered to the Diocese of Lincoln</span>, 1812, 10); he was strongly attacked in ripostes from the Unitarian John Disney and the latitudinarian Sydney Smith. Although Tomline shared with the older generation of high-churchmen a keen interest in patristic scholarship and an &#145;eirenicism towards continental Protestantism&#146;  (Nockles, 156), his aggressive assertion of the protestant nature of Anglicanism tended to distinguish him from them.<br>
<br>In 1813 Tomline declined the bishopric of London on the death of John Randolph, as he was uneasy about the heavy responsibilities which that diocese would have involved. In July 1820, however, he was nominated bishop of Winchester and was enthroned by proxy on 27 October. He then resigned the deanery of St Paul's. In February 1823 his claim to a Nova Scotia baronetcy, originally conferred by Charles I upon Sir Thomas Pretyman, and dormant since 1749, was confirmed. Although for the rest of his life he was styled Sir George Pretyman Tomline, his descendants relinquished any claim to the title.<br>
<br>Tomline died of apoplexy at Kingston Hall, near Wimborne, Dorset, on 14 November 1827 and was buried in Winchester Cathedral on 28 November. His wife had died on 13 June 1826. He had few qualms about pluralism and also used his influence to advance members of his family in the church. His brother John became archdeacon of Lincoln, his second son George became chancellor of Lincoln and prebendary of Winchester, and his third son Richard became precentor of Lincoln. His eldest son, William Edward, was MP for, successively, Christchurch, Truro, and Minehead. Tomline himself in public created an impression of aloof dignity. James Green's portrait shows him as refined, scholarly, and rather austere. In sympathetic company, however, he was capable of genial informality and he was a devoted husband and parent. He earned the respect of men of such different opinions as Samuel Parr. Particularly from 1806 he was a strong supporter of the existing order in church and state. His influence in the defence of both was considerable.<br>
