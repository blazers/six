<span class="headword">Balliol <span class="st"> [Baliol]</span>,  Alexander  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1310?), <span class="occ">nobleman and administrator</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1207/', "Henry de Balliol (d. 1246)")</script>, chamberlain of Scotland, and his wife, Lora de Valognes (<i>d</i>. in or before 1272). Alexander, who was lord of Cavers in Roxburghshire, is clearly distinguishable from his namesake and contemporary, Alexander de Balliol, lord of Barnard Castle from 1271 to 1278 and third son of John de Balliol (<i>d</i>. 1268), who was cousin german to the subject of this memoir. Alexander de Balliol of Cavers was heir to his elder brother, Guy, who was killed while serving as standard-bearer for Simon de Montfort at the battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265. Since Alexander himself was also a baronial rebel, he was not allowed to succeed to his English estates until he returned to the king's peace, which he did in late 1266. He married, shortly after 7 November 1270, Isabel, heir to the barony of Chilham in Kent, which Alexander continued to hold &#145;by courtesy of England&#146; after her death in 1292. His tenure of this barony, together with his mother's Valognes inheritance, which was particularly extensive in Hertfordshire and Essex, made Alexander a landowner of some consequence in south-eastern England.<br>
<br>Already holder of extensive estates in southern Scotland, Alexander de Balliol's Scottish interests were also enlarged by marriage. His wife was the widow of David of Strathbogie, earl of Atholl from 1264 until his death in 1270, when Alexander's stepson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49383/', "John Strathbogie")</script>, was probably still a minor. After a long period of difficulties, Alexander and Isabel eventually secured John's succession&#151;he was first styled earl of Atholl early in 1284. Whatever the source and nature of the difficulties, Alexander's involvement in Scottish affairs increased noticeably following the accidental death of Alexander III, king of Scots, in 1286.<br>
<br>By early December 1287 Balliol was serving the guardians of the realm of Scotland as chamberlain, a post held by his father, his maternal grandfather, and great-grandfather before him. He continued in this office during the remaining period of the guardianship and for much of the reign of his second cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "King John")</script>, at least until early December 1295. Throughout his period of office, the fortunate chance survival of a series of letters of protection and attorney, together with numerous official writs and receipts, even the transcript of an exchequer account, not only testify to much intense activity on his part in Scotland, but also clearly demonstrate how this important and demanding office worked. His brother, William, a clerk and probably the rector of Kirkpatrick Durham (Kirkcudbrightshire), acted as his deputy or agent in 1288 and again in 1291&#150;2. Clearly, Alexander was regarded as a key figure in Scottish government circles, being one of the twelve guardians elected at the Stirling parliament of July 1295 to take the direction of government out of King John's hands.<br>
<br>Enough is known of Balliol's later career to suggest that, although he was frequently employed in the service of the king of England, Edward I never regarded him as being above suspicion. His English and Scottish estates were temporarily forfeited in 1296&#150;7 but were restored after Alexander's performance of military service in Flanders in 1297. He served with Edward on military campaign in Scotland, evidently being present on the English side at the battle of Falkirk (1298) and the siege of Caerlaverock (1300). His role as one of Edward's agents in southern Scotland was enhanced upon his appointment in 1302 as keeper of the forest of Selkirk and warden of the important garrison of the peel of Selkirk. However, in 1301 his eldest son, another Alexander, had been taken into English royal custody, probably as surety for his father's conduct, and in early February 1303 Balliol himself was arrested for alleged trespass. About six weeks later, upon delivery as hostage of another son, Thomas, he was released and had his lands restored; in the meantime, the peel of Selkirk had fallen to Edward's enemies.<br>
<br>After February 1304, when the submission of most Scots seemed to assure permanent success for Edward I, Alexander de Balliol began to petition him vigorously for the restitution of those Scottish lands and rights which had been confiscated (for instance his lands between the Mounth and the Forth), or for the granting of those which had been promised (such as Kirkpatrick Durham in Kirkcudbrightshire) or had come into the English king's gift (notably the lands of Richard Fraser and Alexander Menzies). The greater emphasis that Alexander placed latterly on his Scottish estates is also indicated indirectly by the fact that in November 1303 he sold the manor of Benington, the centre of his Hertfordshire estates, and other lands and rights elsewhere in Hertfordshire and Essex, the purchaser being John de Benstede (or Binsted), controller of the wardrobe under Edward I. The balance was tilted even further towards Scotland as a result of one of Alexander's last recorded acts, in March 1310, by which he resigned his curtesy tenure of the barony of Chilham. There is little doubt that the events in Scotland in 1306 threw Balliol firmly onto the English side, and there is record of his military involvement against Robert I between 1307 and 1309.<br>
<br>The final recorded reference to Alexander de Balliol occurs in April 1310, and he probably died in that year. His second son, Thomas, appeared in possession of the lordship of Cavers later in 1310, and was married in early 1313. His eldest son, Alexander, was evidently released by Edward II from almost nine years' imprisonment in March 1310, following his father's resignation of Chilham. His stepson, John Strathbogie, earl of Atholl, followed an entirely divergent political course, marrying into the Mar family and becoming a firm and militant adherent of the Brus family as early as 1290. The extent of Alexander de Balliol's progeny is otherwise uncertain, but may have included a third son, William, and a daughter, Margaret. There is no evidence to support the suggestion that he may have married more than once.<br>
