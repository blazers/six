<span class="headword">Stewart,  Balfour</span>  (1828&#150;1887), <span class="occ">physicist and meteorologist</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 1 November 1828, the son of William Stewart, a tea merchant of Leith, and his wife, Jane, daughter of William Clouston, for sixty years minister of Stromness, Orkney. William Stewart belonged to the Stewarts of Brough, Orkney, who at one time owned the Fair Isle and other land. Balfour Stewart took his name from a grandmother who belonged to the family of Balfours of Balfour. His uncle, the Revd Charles Clouston of Sandwick, Orkney, was a well-known meteorologist and naturalist.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyresearch"></a>Education and early research</h2>Balfour Stewart went to school in Dundee, then for a short time, at the age of thirteen, to the University of St Andrews. At the University of Edinburgh in 1845&#150;6 he attended the class of James David Forbes, the professor of natural philosophy. On leaving the university at the age of eighteen he began an apprenticeship in the office of a cousin, James Balfour, a Leith merchant. Stewart travelled to Australia on business in 1855, where his taste for physical science developed. His first two papers&#151;&#145;On the influence of gravity on the physical condition of the moon's surface&#146; and &#145;On the adaptation of the eye to the rays which emanate from bodies&#146;&#151;were contributed in 1855 to the Philosophical Society of Victoria.<br>
<br>On his return Stewart gave up business, and in February 1856 he joined the staff of Kew observatory as assistant observer to John Welsh. In October 1856 he became assistant to his former teacher, Forbes, at the University of Edinburgh, Stewart lecturing on mechanics and mathematical subjects. At that time he also worked at pure mathematics with Professor Philip Kelland, and in 1856 wrote a paper on a theorem in the theory of numbers, his only published contribution to mathematics for which he showed distinct aptitude. In 1857 he published on the relation between the density and composition of sulphuric acid solutions, deducing the existence of definite compounds of the acid and water. Spencer Umfreville Pickering and others subsequently employed Stewart's method of research.<h2>
<a name="Radiantheat"></a>Radiant heat</h2>It was under Forbes's influence, and with free access to Forbes's unique collection of thermal apparatus, that Stewart undertook the researches on radiant heat which form his most important contribution to physical science, and for which in 1868 he was awarded the Rumford medal by the Royal Society. Stewart extended the theory of exchanges due to Pierre Prevost of Geneva, and in 1858 proved, in opposition to Fourier, that radiation is not a surface phenomenon, that it depends on the thickness of the radiating body, and in general that at any given temperature and for any kind of radiation the absorption of a plate equals its radiation. Meanwhile Gustav Robert Kirchhoff arrived independently at results which included those of Stewart, and led to the explanation of the dark lines in the solar spectrum as due to the absorption of radiation by layers of the vapours of various elements, and to the foundation by himself and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen of spectrum analysis.<br>
<br>Stewart continued his researches on this subject after his appointment in 1859 as director of the Kew observatory, in succession to the late John Welsh. In 1860 he undertook experiments on tourmaline, following an experimental arrangement suggested by G. G. Stokes that his law held good for polarized rays of light. In the same year Stewart also showed that red glass, when raised to a sufficiently high temperature, would emit a greenish light, and similarly that a piece of blackened platinum foil appears, when heated, brighter in the blackened part than elsewhere. In May 1861 he wrote a paper on the theory of internal radiation in uniaxal crystals, which was developed in the same year by Stokes. By this time, however, Kirchhoff had practically exhausted the subject for the time being.<h2>
<a name="MeteorologyatKew"></a>Meteorology at Kew</h2>In his eleven-year term as director of the Kew observatory (1859&#150;71) Stewart devoted himself mainly to meteorology, and especially to the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism. Under his guidance Kew became a national centre for the standardization and testing of thermometers, sextants, dipping needles, and other instruments required for meteorological or magnetic work. In August and September 1859 there had been a great magnetic disturbance, accompanied by auroral displays and by marked changes in sunspots; the analysis of the photographic records of the magnetic storm at Kew directed Stewart's attention to the connections between solar behaviour and terrestrial phenomena. General Edward Sabine had previously shown a connection between the occurrence of sunspots and magnetic disturbances. In 1861 Stewart put forward the view that aurorae, magnetic storms, and earth currents were due to variations in a primary electric current in the sun. These themes became leitmotifs throughout the rest of Stewart's career in physical research. In 1862 he was elected FRS, and in the same year he suggested that the red prominences on the sun were solar aurorae.<br>
<br>In 1863 Stewart made a careful investigation of the increase of pressure of a given volume of air between 32 &deg;F and 212 &deg;F, and his result for this important constant agreed closely with that of Victor Regnault. On 8 September that year Stewart married Katharine Stevens, only daughter of Charles Stevens, a lawyer in London; they had two sons and a daughter. In 1866 Stewart redetermined the density of mercury at 32 &deg;F with great accuracy and published his widely read <span class="italic">Treatise on Heat</span>. By then it was known that the law of radiation of Stewart and Kirchhoff did not hold for a moving body in an enclosure of constant temperature. In conjunction with Professor P. G. Tait, whom he had known since becoming an examiner of the University of Edinburgh in 1861, Stewart carried out a number of experiments on the heating of a disc by rapid rotation <i>in vacuo</i>. The apparatus for the trials undertaken between 1865 and 1873 was designed by R. Beckley, engineer to the Kew observatory. These experiments were discussed and analysed by James Clerk Maxwell, Professor Ludwig Boltzmann, and others, but without reaching agreement on the correct explanation of the heating effect elicited.<br>
<br>In 1865&#150;8 Stewart published, in conjunction with Warren De La Rue and Benjamin Loewy, a long series of investigations on sunspots, the variation of which they attempted, albeit not without controversy, to trace to changes in planetary configuration. Nevertheless, Stewart showed that the daily range of magnetic variation appeared to be connected with these changes. He spent much effort from this time until his death on the discovery of certain periodic inequalities in terrestrial and solar phenomena. Stewart attempted to deduce causes for these inequalities in a project he called cosmical meteorology, and he collaborated with many individuals on researches to this end. Since Stewart knew that such deductions could be regarded as valid only when based on an extremely large number of observations, with the assistance of William Dodgson, William Lant Carpenter, and others, he spent a large amount of labour on the necessary calculations.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1867 Stewart was appointed secretary to the government meteorological committee, and in this and the following year he supervised the installation of meteorological stations all over the kingdom. He resigned the post in 1869 following a major disagreement with Sabine about the collection and analysis of meteorological data. He continued, however, to act as superintendent of Kew observatory until 1871.<h2>
<a name="ProfessoratManchester"></a>Professor at Manchester</h2>On 7 July 1870 Stewart was appointed professor of natural philosophy in the Owens College, Manchester, his reputation for educational writing having been secured by his book of that year <span class="italic">Lessons in Elementary Physics</span>. In one of his journeys from London, in November 1870, he met with a railway accident in which his thigh was crushed, and for nine months he lay ill at Harrow, in the course of which he passed from &#145;vigorous activity &hellip; to a grey-headed old age&#146;  (Tait, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, 202), although his mental powers remained unimpaired.<br>
<br>Returning to duties at Owens in 1871, Stewart established a new physics laboratory for students in which he taught J. J. Thomson, Arthur Schuster, and J. H. Poynting. He was not a forceful lecturer, but introduced his disorderly students to the joys of research in the laboratory. Despite his injury, Stewart published two major textbooks in 1872, his <span class="italic">Conservation of Energy</span> (many editions and translations) and his <span class="italic">Primer in Physics</span>. Between 1875 and 1885 he worked with his assistant W. H. H. Gee on a series of textbooks on practical physics, and composed the entry on terrestrial magnetism for the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>.<h2>
<a name="Religionandspiritualism"></a>Religion and spiritualism</h2>In April 1875 Stewart and Tait published anonymously a book called <span class="italic">The Unseen Universe</span>. They aimed at deducing from theological postulates and scientific evidence the existence of the soul and of a transcendental universe, and thus that the doctrines of science and religion were by no means in conflict, as contemporary materialists had claimed. Written in a popular and picturesque style the book excited much attention, running through fourteen editions in thirteen years, the authors only avowing their identity in the fourth edition (April 1876). Professor William Kingdon Clifford had made an attack on the book from the heterodox point of view in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (June 1875), to which a reply was offered in the preface to the second edition. A sequel published in 1878 by Stewart and Tait, dedicated to the members of the Paradoxical Society, and entitled <span class="italic">Paradoxical Philosophy</span>, portrayed in dialogue form the conversion of a cynical and heterodox German mathematician to religious and social orthodoxy, but proved less successful.<br>
<br>Stewart, who was a devoted and fervent churchman, was elected by a conference held at Lambeth Palace on 7 January 1881 as member of a committee for promoting interchange of views between scientific men of orthodox views in religious matters. He was also one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research, in whose investigations he took a deep interest. He made several short contributions to its proceedings, and was president from 1885 until his death. In February 1887 he was elected president of the Physical Society, and also of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. He died suddenly on 19 December 1887 of apoplexy at Ballymagarvey, a small estate near Drogheda which he had inherited, where he was spending Christmas. He was survived by his wife. Stewart was known to his friends and family as a man of exceptionally modest, gentle, and kindly nature. His collaborator, Tait, added that Stewart was &#145;full of the most weird and grotesque ideas which made him a most stimulating conversationalist and co-worker&#146;  (Tait, <span class="italic">PRS</span>, xi).<br>
<br>At the time of his death Stewart's speculations on cosmical meteorology had become less reputable as critics had pointed out the discrepancies in different experimental reports of solar&#150;terrestrial correlations. Although his junior colleague Arthur Schuster pursued Stewart's project after 1887, it was only in the latter decades of the twentieth century that Stewart's conviction of a correlation between sunspots and weather was borne out by weather forecasters.<br>
