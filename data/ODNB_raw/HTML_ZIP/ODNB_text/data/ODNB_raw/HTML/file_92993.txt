<span class="headword">Concannon,  John Dennis <span class="st"> [Don]</span></span>  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 16 May 1930 at 6 Aberconway Crescent, Rossington, near Doncaster, Yorkshire, the son of James Dennis Concannon, miner, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spencer. He was educated at Rossington secondary school and subsequently at Doncaster Technical College. He joined the Coldstream Guards in 1947, and served in Palestine, Libya, and on ceremonial duties in London. His time in Libya introduced him to basketball, in which his height (6 ft 4 in.) was an asset. He represented the guards and subsequently Nottinghamshire, and was an England trialist. In 1953 he left the army, went down the pit at Rufford colliery near Mansfield, and on 20 June married Iris May Wilson, a 21-year-old shoe operative from Mansfield, and daughter of Charles Richard Wilson, miner. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Concannon soon became prominent in the Rufford branch of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Active also within the Mansfield Labour Party, he became a town councillor. Late in 1965 he joined the NUM's parliamentary panel and could seek a candidacy with the union's financial backing. When Harold Wilson announced an election in February 1966 Mansfield lacked a Labour candidate, the veteran NUM-sponsored member having announced his retirement. NUM branches were strongly represented at the subsequent selection conference, and Concannon was chosen. Aged thirty-five, he had secured a safe Labour seat which he held with a majority of over 18,000 in the election of March 1966. Within the rule-governed politics of the NUM such a rapid journey from pitface to parliament was unusual.<br>
<br>Sense of duty to the party, trade union background, and military bearing made Concannon an ideal recruit to the whips' office. Appointed in 1968, he served through the 1969 trauma over industrial relations reform and the opposition years of the early 1970s. His own union played a notable part in the industrial struggles that challenged the policies of the Heath government. During the 1960s miners had endured pit closures and meagre pay settlements. From 1966 the development of uniform wage payments under the National Power Loading Agreement had meant that higher-earning coalfields such as Nottinghamshire had been held back to facilitate wage standardization. The consequential discontent strengthened local support for successful national strikes in 1972 and 1974. Concannon unambiguously backed his union and ridiculed any suggestion that Nottinghamshire would prove a weak link, as had been the case in the 1926 dispute.<br>
<br>When the 1974 strike precipitated a general election and an unexpected Labour victory, Concannon was appointed vice-chamberlain of the royal household. This required him to write out a daily summary of Commons events for the queen. This appropriate responsibility for an ex-guardsman proved brief. The collapse of the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland meant an increase in ministerial strength at the Northern Ireland Office. Concannon was appointed a parliamentary under-secretary under Merlyn Rees in June 1974, and then from April 1976 (in the Callaghan government) minister of state under Rees and then under another NUM-sponsored parliamentarian, Roy Mason. He had responsibility for industrial development and security. He strongly backed government support for the DeLorean car factory project, in the expectation that this would bring much-needed jobs to west Belfast. The promoters' assurances proved bogus. The cost to the government was &pound;53 million. Security policy was more immediately controversial. Concannon defended the Royal Ulster Constabulary against persistent and well-founded allegations of brutal interrogation techniques at the Castlereagh centre in Belfast. He was criticized by all shades of nationalist opinion, who were also unhappy about the government seeking to protect their uncertain parliamentary position by courting the votes of Unionist MPs. Concannon was a sociable and assiduous minister. He recalled how his weekend socializing had included both the Republican MP and publican Frank Maguire and the predominantly Unionist workers of the Harland and Wolff shipyard.<br>
<br>The election defeat of May 1979 brought Concannon onto the opposition front bench, initially with responsibility for defence, but under Michael Foot's leadership from November 1980 he reverted to the Northern Ireland brief. During his time in Belfast, Republican prisoners in the H blocks at the Maze prison had campaigned for political status. Mason and Concannon had opposed this demand, which became symbolized in the so-called dirty protest. By early 1981 some protesters were on hunger strike. One hunger striker, Bobby Sands, was successful in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election in April. With Sands's death imminent, Concannon visited him and insisted that the Labour Party would not support the hunger strikers' campaign. The intervention had Foot's support. It was condemned by John Hume, the leader of the constitutional nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, who was aware of the volatility of nationalist opinion. Although Concannon was involved in a Labour Party study group that developed a policy of seeking Irish unification through consent, the Sands visit and his tough line on security began to marginalize Concannon within a party that was shifting to the left. At the 1982 party conference he defended the use of plastic bullets. A year later, following the election of Gerry Adams as a Sinn F&eacute;in MP, he opposed any talks with &#145;Sinn F&eacute;in/IRA&#146;. Such unwillingness to adjust to changing moods weakened his position within the parliamentary party. Under Neil Kinnock's leadership from October 1983 he no longer sat on the opposition front bench.<br>
<br>The miners' solidarity of the early 1970s had meanwhile weakened, not least because of the introduction of area productivity schemes. Nottinghamshire miners earned relatively high wages and felt that their jobs were secure. Old identities weakened. In the 1983 election Concannon's majority fell to little over 2000. In contrast, with the election of Arthur Scargill as national president in 1981 and his succession to Joe Gormley the following year, the left controlled the institutions of the NUM. When a strike over colliery closures began in March 1984, Nottinghamshire miners voted decisively to work on. In the absence of a national ballot most went to work protected by police against pickets from other coalfields. Concannon backed the Nottinghamshire majority against the national policy of his own union. One left-wing Labour MP called him &#145;a copper's nark&#146;, another referred to his constituents as &#145;scabs&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Dec 2003). In the bitter aftermath of the strike the majority of Nottinghamshire miners voted to leave the NUM. They formed the core of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM), a body denied affiliation by both the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party. Concannon's support for the UDM meant the end of his NUM sponsorship and threatened his position as an MP. His determination to resist was ended by a serious car accident in October 1985. His final Commons speech a year later was a requiem for the political and trade-union world that had brought him into parliament. The Mansfield Labour Party chose a pro-strike candidate. Concannon opposed his selection. In the 1987 election he backed a UDM official running as a moderate Labour candidate. Despite this breach of party rules he was never expelled from the Labour Party.<br>
<br>During his retirement Concannon served for eight years as a member of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. He died of cancer at the John Eastwood Hospice, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, on 14 December 2003, and was survived by his widow and four children. He was buried at St Peter's Church, Mansfield, on 19 December. Genial, straightforward, and patriotic, he was a loyal trade-union MP who offered reassurance to party leaders. Yet his career saw the erosion from both left and right of a familiar Labour culture. In Concannon's case, hunger strikers and a bitterly divided coalfield were sombre images of disintegration.<br>
