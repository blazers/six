<span class="headword">Graham,  Eleanor</span>  (1896&#150;1984), <span class="occ">publisher and children's writer</span>, was born at 18 Grosvenor Park Road, Walthamstow, Essex, on 9 January 1896, the youngest child of Peter Anderson Graham (<i>d</i>. 1925), a reporter for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Courant</span> and, after 1900, editor of <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McLeod (<i>d</i>. 1926?), who had been the librarian of a private lending library in Edinburgh. P. Anderson Graham was one of &#145;[W. E.] Henley's young men&#146; in the 1890s, the literary set that included Kenneth Grahame, whose biography Eleanor later wrote. When she was six her parents separated, which upset her deeply. She was very close to her Scottish grandmother, whose country ways she captured in her semi-autobiographical book, <span class="italic">Head O'Mey</span> (1947).<br>
<br>Eleanor Graham was educated at Chingford high school in Essex, at the North London Collegiate School for Girls, and at the London School of Medicine. She decided against a career in medicine, and left the school in 1916. She joined Lady Muriel Paget's mission to Czechoslovakia in the early 1920s, travelling widely to distribute aid in the countryside until she caught typhoid fever and had to return home. She settled in London, attending poetry readings at the Poetry Bookshop, where for a penny she heard Yeats read &#145;Innisfree&#146;. Although she published her first children's book in this period, she never made her living by writing. In 1927 she was hired by the Bumpus Bookshop in Oxford Street to run its new children's room. She confided to her employer that she knew nothing of children's books and received the comforting reply that no one else did either.<br>
<br>Very little critical or scholarly attention was paid to children's books before the 1930s, much rubbish was sold for children, and the good that came their way did so unheralded and often by chance. Graham was one of the first to see that a critical apparatus was needed for the evaluation of children's books and, as head of the respected Bumpus children's room, she was in an ideal position to make good the deficiency. During the late 1920s the first children's rooms in public libraries were established and Graham learned a great deal from watching children and librarians select books. She was convinced that children deserved books of the highest quality, and was ahead of her time in believing that any child was capable of responding to great writing, no matter how underprivileged his or her background. The period was a golden age for children's fiction but Graham felt the need for improvement in non-fiction for children, especially in science and history. She lamented that so little poetry was published for children, and raided the Bumpus stockroom for suitable collections. She was responsible for introducing Walter de la Mare, previously seen as an adult writer, to children. She worked at Bumpus until 1931 and took a proper pride in the influence she exercised through the job. She was not in awe of authors, and once advised Arthur Ransome that his new book <span class="italic">Swallows and Amazons</span> would sell better if he gave it some illustrations. He took her advice.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Graham worked as a children's book editor for William Heinemann and for Methuen, and briefly as the librarian for a private lending library that operated from a garage in Kensington, where she continued to observe children's reading habits. She reviewed children's books for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Bookman</span>, and later for the new <span class="italic">Junior Bookshelf</span>. In 1938 she published her best-known book, <span class="italic">The Children who Lived in a Barn</span>. It was a worthy attempt to inject a little reality into the implausible holiday story genre spawned by Ransome's imitators, and as such is of interest more as a document than as a work of fiction.<br>
<br>In 1940 Graham, who had taken a wartime job with the Board of Trade, was summoned by Allen Lane, publisher of the new Penguin Books, to his country house to discuss a new series for children. She arrived late and they spoke until two o'clock in the morning; Lane made her the editor of his new children's paperback series, Puffin Books, a position she held until her retirement in 1961. She was determined that the Puffin imprint should always signify quality and that it should not confine itself to well-established children's classics but should seek out modern classics. Despite the paper shortage and booksellers' doubt about the cheap new series, Puffin achieved a list of thirty-two titles by 1946, the first being Barbara Euphan Todd's <span class="italic">Worzel Gummidge</span>. The series was a huge success and contributed greatly to children's literature, first by providing an affordable format for high-quality children's books, and secondly by the work it commissioned: Roger Lancelyn Green's <span class="italic">King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table</span> (1953), for example, or Graham's own anthology, <span class="italic">A Puffin Book of Verse</span> (1953). The latter, drawing heavily on Graham's favourite poet Robert Herrick, reflected her interest in putting into children's hands poetry originally written for adults. She addressed the lack of historical writing for children, starting the <span class="roman">Story Biography</span> series for Methuen and contributing to it <span class="italic">The Story of Charles Dickens</span> (1952).<br>
<br>Eleanor Graham retired from Puffin in 1961. She had always worked from her London flat, and now she moved to Loughton, a country village, but she kept an approving eye on Kaye Webb, her young successor at Puffin. Children's literature entered a period of rapid change in the 1960s, and the book list Graham had built up was beginning to look a little fusty. The 1960s and 1970s put an end to the popularity of many of the titles Graham had selected, but they also saw the rise of young authors to whom she had given their first commissions, such as the artist Brian Wildsmith, who had illustrated Graham's <span class="italic">The Story of Jesus</span> (1960). She continued to review children's books and remained a respected authority on them for the rest of her life. In 1973 she received the Children's Book Circle Eleanor Farjeon award for services to children's literature. She died at Hereford Lodge, Hereford Road, Westminster, London, on 8 March 1984.<br>
<br>Eleanor Graham was a soft-spoken woman whose wide-apart shining eyes gave her a childlike appearance. There was nothing na&iuml;ve, however, about her critical faculties. She helped to elevate children's writing to a respected genre of English literature and assisted the numerous talented authors who emerged after about 1930 both as a publisher, by making their work available to the widest possible audience, and as a reviewer, by holding them accountable. Children, to her, were readers to be treated with the greatest respect, for them &#145;nothing but the best is good enough&#146;  (Clark, 91).<br>
