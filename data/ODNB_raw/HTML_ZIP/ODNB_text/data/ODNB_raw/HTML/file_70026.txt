<span class="headword">Shaw,  Mabel</span>  (1888&#150;1973), <span class="occ">missionary and educationist</span>, was born on 3 December 1888 at Prestwood Road, Heath Town, Willenhall, Wolverhampton, the eldest of three boys and two girls of Matthew Shaw, a tea-shop manager, and his wife, Elizabeth Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Purchase. Between the ages of five and ten she lived with her grandmother in the Berkshire countryside and there, and later at her boarding-school in the Isle of Wight, she became a convinced Christian. On leaving school she went to study for four years in Edinburgh at St Colm's ecumenical Women's Missionary Training College, which had been founded by the remarkable Ann Hunter Small, who had herself been a missionary and educationist in India. At St Colm's, Shaw imbibed an informed respect for non-Christian religious traditions and beliefs, as well as a critical understanding of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. She was not forced into one religious pattern but was encouraged to find and &#145;follow her own bent, but without exclusiveness towards other points of view&#146;  (Wyon, 72).<br>
<br>Armed with Miss Small's injunction &#145;to understand and sympathise with the inner character and thought of the peoples of Asia and Africa&#146;  (A. Small, preface to <span class="italic">Missionary College Hymns</span>, 1914) Mabel Shaw accepted the London Missionary Society's call to go out to central Africa to start the Christian education of girls, and sailed for Cape Town in 1915. After a week's train journey to Broken Hill she was carried by bearers for a month overland&#151;across plains, forests, and rivers, camping out in the open and learning as much as she could of her porters' language, until she reached Mbereshi in what is now Zambia. She then spent the first year learning to understand and speak Cibemba and acquainting herself with the local African traditions, especially with the traditional upbringing of girls. However initially shocked and alienated she was by some of the tribal customs concerning women, she knew it would be presumptuous to condemn everything out of hand. Instead she decided to build her own school village on traditional African foundations, growing communal crops, learning crafts such as pottery, and respecting the spirituality of the Africans' animist beliefs while having Christ as their chief.<br>
<br>Over the next twenty-five years Mabel Shaw grew to have immense faith in her girl pupils&#151;among whom was the future wife of Kenneth Kaunda&#151;and she described her activities in a number of articles and books in the 1920s and 1930s. These included <span class="italic">Children of the Chief</span> (1921), <span class="italic">Dawn in Africa: Stories of Girl Life</span> (1927), and also <span class="italic">God's Candlelights: an Educational Venture in Northern Rhodesia</span> (1932). What grieved her was the threat of destabilization and degradation resulting from European exploitation of the copperbelt with its shanty towns, alcohol, gambling, and prostitution. She was also appalled by the racist superiority complex of the white colonial settlers.<br>
<br>After laying the foundations for girls' primary education, teacher training, and nursing, and exercising a permanent influence on government and missionary educational policy in Africa, Mabel Shaw retired to Britain in 1940. However, she continued to publicize the cause of African women's education in Britain. She spoke in churches, schools, and colleges (and also on the BBC) making common cause with the anti-colonialist Dr Norman Leys in passionately opposing the British colonial education policy that restricted, via grossly unequal funding, the African child's educational aspirations to what a white child was expected to know by the age of ten.<br>
<br>After long years of crippling arthritis Mabel Shaw died on 25 April 1973 in the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey, almost destitute and apparently forgotten. Her great sorrow was that in her last years she had nothing to give those of &#145;her&#146; African girls who had succeeded in reaching Britain for further education and training. But after she had been cremated her ashes were flown out to Mbereshi where there was a huge memorial service and Mama Shaw could be buried in the chapel grounds of the school she had founded more than half a century before.<br>
