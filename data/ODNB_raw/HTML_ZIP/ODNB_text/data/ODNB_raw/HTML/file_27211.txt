<span class="headword">Thomas,  Arthur Goring</span>  (1850&#150;1892), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 20 November 1850 at Ratton Park, Sussex, the youngest son of Freeman Thomas of Ratton Park and his wife, Amelia, eldest daughter of Colonel Thomas Frederick. As a child Thomas showed exceptional musical abilities, and at the age of ten demonstrated remarkable powers of extemporization. He was educated at Haileybury College and intended for a career in the civil service, but ill health prevented this and he decided on the serious study of music. In 1873 he went to Paris, where, on the advice of the composer Ambroise Thomas, he studied for two years with Emile Durand. In 1875 he returned to England and on 13 September 1877 began a three-year course at the Royal Academy of Music. He studied under Arthur Sullivan and Ebenezer Prout and won the Lucas composition medal in 1879 and again, with his dramatic scena <span class="italic">Hero and Leander</span>, in 1880. He also received lessons in orchestration from Max Bruch. A student composition, the anthem &#145;Out of the deep&#146;, for soprano, chorus, and orchestra, was performed at a concert of the academy on 19 June 1878. His first attempt at opera, <span class="italic">Don Braggadocio</span>, to a libretto by his brother, was never completed, but part of <span class="italic">The Light of the Harem</span> was successfully performed by the academy on 7 November 1879. In 1881 his choral ode <span class="italic">The Sun-Worshippers</span> was performed at the Norwich festival and published in London.<br>
<br>These achievements led to a commission for an opera from the impresario Carl Rosa, which Thomas fulfilled with <span class="italic">Esmeralda</span>, to a libretto by Theo Marzials and Alberto Randegger based loosely on Victor Hugo's <span class="italic">Notre-Dame de Paris</span>, and dedicated to the soprano Pauline Viardot. <span class="italic">Esmeralda</span> was first performed by the Carl Rosa company at Drury Lane on 26 March 1883 and immediately became popular. Performances of the work in German translation at Cologne (14 November 1883) and Hamburg (27 September 1884) were exceptionally well received. It was revived at Covent Garden on 12 July 1890, sung in French and with the original happy ending altered by the composer to a tragic one.<br>
<br>In 1885 the Carl Rosa company produced a second opera by Thomas, <span class="italic">Nadeshda</span>, with a libretto adapted by Julian Sturgis from a Russian story. The first performance took place at Drury Lane on 16 April with Alwina Valleria in the title role, and it was performed in Dublin on 27 August of the same year. It was also given in a German version at Breslau in 1890. An orchestral <span class="italic">Suite de ballet</span> was performed at Cambridge by the University Musical Society, for which it was composed, on 9 June 1887, and a duet for soprano and mezzo-soprano, &#145;The Dawn&#146; (&#145;Aurora is Waking&#146;), was performed at the Birmingham festival in 1891.<br>
<br>In addition, Thomas composed many songs and vocal duos, some of which were fashionable in the late 1880s and early 1890s, and three further dramatic vocal scenas. An unfinished comic opera, <span class="italic">The Golden Web</span>, was completed by S. P. Waddington and produced posthumously at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool (15 February 1893), and at the Lyric Theatre, London (11 March 1893). Another unfinished work, the cantata <span class="italic">The Swan and the Skylark</span>, was completed by Charles Villiers Stanford and performed at the Birmingham festival in 1894.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Esmeralda</span> and <span class="italic">Nadeshda</span> achieved for Thomas the position of leading British musical dramatist of his day and a high reputation in Germany. His music shows predominantly French lyrical influences and a talent for elegant melody and sensitive orchestration, but it is less successful in sustaining dramatic interest throughout the complicated plots. Contemporary critics commented on the naturalness and flexibility of the recitatives, which, in contrast to his generally conservative style, were considered advanced. Shortly after Thomas's death, George Bernard Shaw assessed his position thus: &#145;He always seemed to be dreaming of other men's music&#151;mostly Frenchmen's; so that he spent his life on elaborating, with remarkable facility and elegance, what Gounod and his disciples had done before&#146;  (Shaw, 2.141).<br>
<br>Thomas's character was considered charming and modest, and Maude Val&eacute;rie White, a fellow pupil at the Royal Academy of Music, described him as &#145;quite exceptionally attractive and agreeable&#146;  (White, 138). However, his naturally fragile mental state was disturbed by the pressure of expectation to produce further works equal in effect to <span class="italic">Esmeralda</span> and <span class="italic">Nadeshda</span>, and was further upset by a serious accident a few months before his death. Suffering from depression, Thomas committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a fast train at West Hampstead Station on 20 March 1892, and was instantly killed. He was buried in Finchley cemetery. A memorial concert was held at St James's Hall, London, on 13 July 1892. Most of the leading operatic singers of the day took part, and, as a result, the Goring Thomas scholarship was founded at the Royal Academy of Music.<br>
