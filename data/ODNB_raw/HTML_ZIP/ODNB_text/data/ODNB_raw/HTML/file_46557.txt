<span class="headword">Czaplicka,  Marya Antonina <span class="st"> [Marie Antoinette]</span></span>  (1884&#150;1921), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born on 25 October 1884 in Warsaw, daughter of Felix Lubicz Czaplicki and Sophie Zawisza. Educated and trained as a geography teacher in Warsaw and Libau (now Liepaja, Latvia) between 1894 and 1905, from 1906 to 1909 she studied natural history in the Warsaw Museum, giving private tuition and acting as a secretary to pay her way. Aged twenty-six endowed with &#145;a considerable amount of personal charm&#146;  (Czaplicka MSS), the first woman to obtain a Mianowski fellowship, she studied ethnology at the London School of Economics in 1910, and met the American anthropologist Henry Usher Hall. At Somerville College, Oxford (1911&#150;12), she obtained a diploma in anthropology. R. Marett, reader in anthropology, eager to combine her scientific and linguistic qualifications (she knew German, Russian, English, Ukrainian, and her native Polish and was to learn Uralic and Tungusic languages), thought she &#145;might profitably devote herself to a synthesis of recent Russian work on the tribes of the Far North&#146;  (Czaplicka MSS). He somewhat lightheartedly suggested a monograph; she enthusiastically agreed, being &#145;keen almost to a fault&#146;  (Czaplicka MSS). Grants from Somerville and Bedford colleges enabled the impoverished scholar to complete <span class="italic">Aboriginal Siberia</span> (1914).<br>
<br>Little fieldwork had been done in north-central Siberia, the vanishing lifestyle of whose peoples involved &#145;magico-religious institutions &hellip; of a very special and psychologically curious type&#146;  (Czaplicka MSS). To fill the gap this young woman became one of few Poles to volunteer for a year's exile in Siberia: &#145;the outcome of my own eager desire and interest&#146;  (Czaplicka, <span class="italic">Siberian Year</span>, 4). A Mary Ewart scholarship at Somerville in 1914 enabled her to visit the northern Yenisey tundra with Henry Hall of the Philadelphia University Museum and two female companions. Czaplicka and Hall wintered with the nomads. In 1915 they returned via wartime Petrograd and Warsaw. Her books and letters ignore illness, seasickness bad enough to cause vomiting of blood, lack of money, inadequate supplies, rare correspondence, harsh temperatures, lack of sanitary facilities, glutinous mud in spring, mosquitoes and dust in summer. Rare glimpses of dry humour and a lyrical joy at tundra flowers and the northern lights betray little about her emotions or relationships. One Siberian companion mentioned her &#145;tireless energy and a most winning address [which], even apart from her intellectual gifts and knowledge of the world, marked Miss Czaplicka's striking personality&#146;  (Haviland, 3). The other companion, Dora Curtis, tartly remarked that she would walk for 35 kilometres up to the knees in tundra moss &#145;with only a piece of bread and appear unsatisfied in the end &hellip; she can accomplish these feats because she has great spirit but afterwards she pays for them dearly&#146;  (Czaplicka MSS). Relevant publications include <span class="italic">My Siberian Year</span> (1915), &#145;On the track of the Tungus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scottish Geographical Magazine</span>, 33, 1917), and &#145;Siberia and some Siberians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Manchester Geographical Society</span>, 32, 1916, 27&#150;42).<br>
<br>Subsequently (1916&#150;19) Mary Ewart lecturer in ethnology at Oxford, Czaplicka was a member of Lady Margaret Hall, where she &#145;instituted a most enterprising Folk-Lore Club&#146;  (Marett, 105) and lectured in Britain and the USA. Politically she favoured an independent, democratic Poland, and advocated allied intervention in Siberia to protect its fledgeling democracy against Bolshevism. Strongly opposed to militarism, she fulminated against the &#145;unscientific&#146; German-fomented pan-Turkism. Such views coupled with rare expertise led to work in the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the war trade intelligence department, where she merited official Polish appreciation for &#145;devotion to her country&#146;. Her political views appear in <span class="italic">Turks of Central Asia</span> (1918), &#145;The Siberian colonist or Sibiriak&#146; in  (W. Stephens, <span class="italic">The Soul of Russia</span>, 1916), &#145;A plea for Siberia&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Europe</span>, 28 March 1918), and &#145;Poland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>, 53, 1919).<br>
<br>In 1920 the Royal Geographical Society's Murchison grant recognized Czaplicka's &#145;ethnographical and geographical work in northern Siberia&#146;. A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Anthropological Institution, she lectured in anthropology at Bristol University from 1920, becoming &#145;quite the life&#146; of the university speleological society and the Clifton Ladies' Debating Society. Her sudden death in Bristol on 27 May 1921 was a great shock. The official explanation, heart failure, concealed suicide by poison. A Polish Catholic, Marya Czaplicka must have been desperate. Why should a 36-year-old woman with a substantial academic record and promising future take her own life? Failure to obtain a cherished permanent university post &#145;was understandably a great blow, for she was taking out letters of naturalization in order to be qualified for it&#146;  (Czaplicka MSS). She may have concluded that a foreigner and woman could never achieve acceptance. A contributory reason may have been debts of over &pound;200. Marett wrote: &#145;she struck fire out of whatever she touched &hellip; Too late her many friends realised that she was living on her organic capital&#146;  (Marett, 106). Unmarried, Czaplicka left no descendants. She was buried in Bristol. In her work she had broken new ground: reclassifying the Siberian peoples, treating shamanism in a novel way, and presenting the first systematic account of arctic hysteria  (Czaplicka, <span class="italic">Aboriginal Siberia</span>, vi). She provided substantial contributions to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</span> (ed. J. Hastings, 1916&#150;21), investigated Cossack communities  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Central Asian Society</span>, 5, 1918), and links between environment and religion  (&#145;Influence of environment upon the religious ideas and practices of the Aborigines of northern Asia&#146;, <span class="italic">Folklore</span>, 25, 1914). Had she lived she might have left a scientific legacy similar to that of her contemporary and correspondent Bronislaw Malinowski  (Collins and Urry, 188&#150;20).<br>
<br>The Marya Antonina Czaplicka Fund was established in 1971 in her memory by a bequest from the anthropologist Mrs Barbara Aitken (Barbara Freire-Marreco) to assist members of Somerville College studying the ancient world, anthropology, or the natural sciences to attend conferences and meetings abroad.<br>
