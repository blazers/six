<span class="headword">Baker,  David Lionel Erskine</span>  (1730&#150;1767?), <span class="occ">theatre historian</span>, was born in the parish of St Dunstan in the West, London, on 30 January 1730, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1120/', "Henry Baker (1698&#150;1774)")</script>, a scientific writer, and his wife, Sophia (1701&#150;1762), who was the youngest daughter of the journalist and novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7421/', "Daniel Defoe (1660?&#150;1731)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1119/', "Henry Baker")</script>, a minor author, was his brother. He was named after his godfather, the ninth earl of Buchan. A studious youth, he was placed by the duke of Montague in the drawing room of the Tower of London to become a royal engineer. In 1747 his proud father gave a lengthy account of his intellectual achievements to the nonconformist minister Philip Doddridge:<blockquote>At twelve years old he had translated the whole twenty-four books of <span class="italic">Telemachus</span> from the French; before he was fifteen he translated from the Italian, and published, a treatise of physic of Dr Cocchi of Florence concerning the diet and doctrines of Pythagoras, and last year, before he was seventeen, he likewise published a treatise of Sir Isaac Newton's <span class="italic">Metaphysics</span> compared with those of Dr Leibnitz, from the French of M. Voltaire. (<span class="italic">Correspondence and Diary</span>, 5.29)</blockquote>He was, moreover, praised for his mastery of Latin, Greek, and mathematics, and was knowledgeable in natural history. Communications from Baker were published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society</span>. But his promise for a scientific career was not to be fulfilled.<br>
<br>Despite family opposition, Baker repeatedly joined companies of strolling players. (Isaac Reed asserted that he was adopted by an uncle and succeeded to his business as a silk throwster in Spitalfields, but failed in that line; this may have been an attempt by his family to wean him from the stage.) He possibly played in Belfast and Drogheda with Sheriffe's company in the spring of 1758, but it is difficult positively to identify his appearances on the stage as there were several actors named Baker. Before 6 October 1762 Baker married Elizabeth Clendon (<i>d</i>. 1778), an actress, who on that date made her d&eacute;but at Covent Garden (as Roxana in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span>). Baker too might have appeared at that theatre between 1762 and 1765. Afterwards, Elizabeth Baker was closely identified with the Edinburgh stage.<br>
<br>In 1764 Baker published <span class="italic">The Companion to the Play House</span> in two volumes, containing notices on plays, authors, and actors. A revised version, edited by Isaac Reed, appeared as <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> in 1782, and a third edition, by Stephen Jones, appeared in 1812. Baker's work was indebted to that of his predecessor Gerard Langbaine, and adds little concerning early dramatists, but has remained a useful reference work for the history of the early eighteenth-century stage. He wrote a small dramatic piece, <span class="italic">The Muse of Ossian</span> (1763), and translated a two-act Italian comedy as <span class="italic">The Maid and the Mistress</span> (<span class="italic">La serva padrona</span>), which was put on in Edinburgh and published in 1763. It is unlikely that he was the &#145;Mr Baker&#146; who in 1745 wrote a preface to the translation of <span class="italic">The Continuation of Don Quixote</span>.<br>
<br>Baker's later life is obscure. His death is variously recorded as taking place in Edinburgh in 1770, in 1780, and, according to John Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</span> (5.277), on 16 February 1767. His wife retired from the stage in 1774 and became a fashionable teacher of elocution in Edinburgh.<br>
