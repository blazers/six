<span class="headword">FitzSimon,  Henry</span>  (1566&#150;1643), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Dublin on 31 May 1566, the son of Sir Nicholas FitzSimon (<i>d</i>. 1585), a Dublin alderman, and his wife, Anna Sedgrave, also from Dublin. He became a protestant at the age of ten. Following a grammar school education in Manchester he matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford, on 26 April 1583. He spent some years at the University of Oxford before going to Paris in 1587, the tenth year of his &#145;education in heresy&#146;  (FitzSimon, <span class="italic">Justification</span>, 115). After some time spent at the University of Paris he converted to Catholicism and studied rhetoric and then philosophy at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson University from 1587 to 1591. He was received into the Society of Jesus in April 1592 and spent his noviciate at Tournai. In June 1593 he went to Louvain to study theology; there he was taught by Lessius and met Rosweyde and Peter Lombard. He spent a brief period as professor of philosophy at Douai before returning to Ireland about 1597.<br>
<br>On the Irish mission FitzSimon was renowned as a persuasive preacher. He conducted his ministry in an open, demonstrative manner, celebrating the first solemn high mass held in Dublin for forty years in 1598. He established a sodality to foster piety, promoted participation in confession and holy communion, and actively sought to attract converts to Catholicism. He was an active supporter of Dublin recusants. His ministry may have been principally among the social &eacute;lite; he reputedly never dined without six to eight guests, and rode through the countryside with three or four gentlemen as companions.<br>
<br>FitzSimon's reputation was built on his skills as a controversialist, and he attracted the attention of prominent members of the established church in Dublin, notably Luke Challoner, John Rider, and James Ussher. Much of the theological debate with these men was conducted during the five years FitzSimon spent in custody in Dublin Castle from 1599 to 1604. Although he claimed he was more harshly treated than others in prison, he none the less had access to books, including materials from the library of Trinity College, which he used in his theological disputations. The facilities accorded him suggest that the debate had semi-official approval. FitzSimon himself believed that divine providence ensured that the books he needed were made available to him. He employed a clerk named Cary, who was his nephew, but he was at a disadvantage as compared with his adversaries in that he was denied access to a printing press while in prison. Thus John Rider, dean of St Patrick's, whom FitzSimon had known since his time in Oxford, was able to publish three books against him in these years, to which FitzSimon could not reply in print. He was, however, able to circulate his texts in manuscript, and Rider offered to assist in getting his material printed.<br>
<br>In June 1604 FitzSimon was taken from Dublin Castle and put on a boat bound for Spain, arriving in Bilbao on 14 June, his request to be sent to the Spanish Netherlands having been rejected by the authorities in Dublin. In Bilbao he made clear his intention to go directly to Rouen or Antwerp to arrange for the printing of his reply to Dean Rider. He spent time as a military chaplain in the Spanish Netherlands, and by September 1607 his book was complete. <span class="italic">A Catholick confutation of Mr John Rider's claim to antiquity, and a calming comfort against his caveat &hellip; and a reply to Mr Rider's rescript</span> was published at Rouen in 1608. During these years he had also found time to conduct research in the libraries at Louvain and Douai on early Irish church history and the lives of Irish saints. On the instructions of his superior, Acquaviva, in 1608, he abandoned his historical researches and travelled to Rome, visiting the shrine of Loreto <i>en route</i>. He made his final profession as a Jesuit in Rome on 15 August 1608. Two years later he was present in Rome for the ceremony of beatification of St Ignatius, founder of the Jesuits, on 20 February 1610. During three years spent in Rome, FitzSimon wrote a lengthy tract on the mass in English, <span class="italic">The Justification and Exposition of the Divine Sacrifice of the Masse</span>, which was published, probably at Douai, in 1611.<br>
<br>FitzSimon also had in mind the compilation of a religious history of Ireland, a history of England, and a study of Irish geography and customs, but these works did not appear in print. He pioneered research into Irish hagiography, compiling a catalogue of some 288 Irish saints and the authors who had written about them. His <span class="italic">Catalogus praecipuorum sanctorum Iberniae</span> was completed in April 1611 and evidently first published in the same year. The third of at least nine editions was issued at Li&egrave;ge in 1619 while FitzSimon was living there. His work on early Irish saints was extensively used by the Bollandists, and his researches were an inspiration to Stephen White and John Colgan and aroused the hostility of the Scottish author Thomas Dempster, who wished to claim many of the saints of &#145;Scotia&#146; for Scotland. In May 1614 FitzSimon's history of the British church was published at Douai. <span class="italic">Britannomachia ministrorum in plerisque et fidei fundamentis et fidei articulis dissidentium</span> denounced protestant clergy and sought to provide an appropriate historical underpinning for the Roman Catholic church in Ireland.<br>
<br>Having returned to Flanders in autumn 1611 FitzSimon worked among the sick. He seems consciously to have sought to minister among victims of the plague, choosing to risk his life in the service of God. His mission he outlined as &#145;to hold and avow the only common doctrine of the Roman Catholic church, in it and with it to live, and (if God in his mercy says Amen) for it most willingly to die&#146;  (Hogan, <span class="italic">Distinguished Irishmen</span>, 283). As had been the case in Ireland he was no stranger in the households of the &eacute;lite. He worked as a chaplain at Douai from 1611 to 1616, and at Li&egrave;ge 1619&#150;23, where he spent time ministering to condemned criminals. In 1620 he was a military chaplain in the imperial camp at Bohemia. He remained there through that year and later published, in Latin, a history of the war there under the apt name of Constantius Peregrinus. It was translated into Italian and reissued several times, but was not without its critics. Under another pseudonym, Candidus Eblanius (the candid Dubliner), his account of the battle of Prague was published at Br&uuml;nn (Brno) in 1620, and also ran to several editions.<br>
<br>FitzSimon was chaplain at Dinant from 1623 to 1631, when he finally returned to Ireland after more than twenty-six years in exile. He was by then effectively in retirement and evidently living in his native Dublin. The Jesuit letters make no mention of him after his return to Ireland, although he was recorded in 1637 as being in good health for his age, seventy-one, having been forty-six years in the Society of Jesus and six years on the Irish mission. According to his first biographer, Young, writing in 1660 (cited in Hogan, <span class="italic">Distinguished Irishmen</span>, 309), he was forced to flee Dublin in the winter of 1641, after the outbreak of rebellion, and eventually made his way to Kilkenny, where he died two years later on 29 November 1643.<br>
