<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell,  (Arthur) Clive Heward</span>  (1881&#150;1964), <span class="occ">art critic and writer</span>, was born on 16 September 1881 at East Shefford, Berkshire, the second son of William Heward Bell (1849&#150;1927), civil engineer, and his wife, Hannah Taylor Cory (1850&#150;1942). In the words of his son Quentin, he came from a &#145;family that drew its wealth from Welsh mines and expended it upon the destruction of wild animals&#146;  (Q. Bell, <span class="italic">Bloomsbury</span>, 23). Their home, Cleeve House at Seend in Wiltshire, was a Regency villa rebuilt as a mock Jacobean mansion and decorated throughout with sporting trophies: growing up there filled Bell with a lifelong horror of vulgarity and a disdain of philistinism. He was educated at Marlborough College (1895&#150;9), where he professed to have been miserable, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, which he entered in the same term (October 1899) as Thoby Stephen, Lytton Strachey, Saxon Sydney-Turner, and Leonard Woolf. The reading society which these freshmen founded in their first year was always claimed by Bell to have laid the foundations of the so-called Bloomsbury group. Like Thoby Stephen, he combined a love of hunting and the outdoors with intellectual curiosity&#151;and in his case an early interest in visual art. Although thought by his fellow undergraduates too worldly for membership of the select Cambridge Conversazione Society (known as the Apostles), Bell anyway fell under the sway of that secret brotherhood's presiding spirit, the philosopher G. E. Moore, whom he later said was &#145;the dominant influence in all our lives&#146;  (C. Bell, 28). Despite obtaining only a second class in both parts of the historical tripos, he was awarded an Earl of Derby studentship in 1902. He went to Paris in 1904, ostensibly to pursue historical research, but in fact wasted his time profitably acquainting himself with the work of the old masters and of modern French painters, and acquiring a taste for caf&eacute; life and the company of artists.<br>
<br>On his return to London, Bell was prominent in the group of friends who met on Thursday evenings at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury, the house shared by the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36271/', "Sir Leslie Stephen (1832&#150;1904)")</script>, the eminent Victorian man of letters and first editor of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Following the early death of Thoby Stephen, Bell married, on 7 February 1907, Thoby's elder sister Vanessa (1879&#150;1961) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30694/', "Bell, Vanessa")</script>]. Clive and Vanessa Bell had two sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61593/', "Julian Heward Bell (1908&#150;1937)")</script>, a poet who was killed in the Spanish Civil War, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64052/', "Quentin Bell (1910&#150;1996)")</script>, an artist, teacher, and writer. The marriage ceased to exist in anything but name before the First World War, partly because of Bell's flirtation with his sister-in-law Virginia (1882&#150;1941) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37018/', "Woolf, (Adeline) Virginia")</script>] who in 1912 married Leonard Woolf. Thereafter Bell was free to enjoy a succession of love affairs, while remaining on the best of terms with Vanessa, who from 1915 lived with her artistic collaborator, Duncan Grant. Angelica Bell (1918&#150;2012) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105034/', "Garnett, Angelica")</script>], whose father was Grant and who later married David Garnett, was brought up as Clive Bell's daughter.<br>
<br>A chance meeting in 1910 with Roger Fry, in a railway carriage between Cambridge and London, altered the whole tenor of Bell's life. Fry was considerably older, and was already well known as an authority on the early Italian Renaissance; but his new interest in contemporary French painting coincided with Bell's. Bell was Fry's eager lieutenant in the organization of the first Post-Impressionist Exhibition at the Grafton Galleries in London that autumn; for the second show, in 1912, he selected an &#145;English Group&#146;. His huge admiration for C&eacute;zanne&#151;whom he called &#145;the Christopher Columbus of a new continent of form&#146;  (C. Bell, <span class="italic">Art</span>, 1914, 207)&#151;was advertised in the book for which he is chiefly remembered, <span class="italic">Art</span>, published in 1914. Here he put forward his famous theory of &#145;significant form&#146;, the proposition that the quality common to all works of art, from the Byzantines to the cubists, consists of &#145;relations and combinations of lines and colours&#146;  (ibid., 8). The representational elements in a picture were, he believed, irrelevant to aesthetic contemplation: in a much-quoted passage he declared that &#145;to appreciate a work of art we need bring with us nothing from life, no knowledge of its ideas and affairs, no familiarity with its emotions&#146;  (ibid., 25). There is much that is tautologous in Bell's argument, and a good deal that is absurd&#151;see, for instance, his insistence that &#145;The bulk &hellip; of those who flourished between the High Renaissance and the contemporary movement may be divided into two classes, virtuosi and dunces&#146;  (ibid., 40)&#151;and his central thesis has been widely discounted; but it should be allowed that he is much less dogmatic than is usually supposed. <span class="italic">Art</span> owed much to the writings of Fry, as well as to Moore's <span class="italic">Principia ethica</span> (1903); it is best read, however, in the context of its time, as a manifesto for post-impressionism. Bell's polemical style was ideally suited to his demolition of canonical aesthetic values, and his book had an enormously liberating effect on a generation of artists and viewers.<br>
<br>Later Bell abandoned theory almost entirely, but he continued to wield considerable influence as a critic, and his exhibition reviews for <span class="italic">The Nation</span> and later the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> between 1913 and 1944 were compulsory reading for a wide audience. If he was rather too prone to denigrate English art in favour of French, and was sometimes guilty of over-praising his friends, he was surely right in 1920 to recognize Picasso and Matisse as the two giants of the modern movement. He also encouraged younger painters such as Ivon Hitchens and Victor Pasmore; but he never came to terms with abstractionism, which his earlier writings had anticipated. His books of criticism, mostly comprising articles for newspapers and periodicals, included <span class="italic">Pot-Boilers</span> (1918), <span class="italic">Since C&eacute;zanne</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Landmarks in Nineteenth-Century Painting</span> (1927), <span class="italic">An Account of French Painting</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Enjoying Pictures</span> (1934).<br>
<br>Bell was an unwavering pacifist in both world wars. He spent much of the first at Garsington, the Oxfordshire home of Philip and Lady Ottoline Morrell, where he undertook desultory employment as a farmworker. His pamphlet <span class="italic">Peace at Once</span> (1915), in which he courageously argued for a negotiated settlement with Germany, was seized by the police, became the subject of a court case, and was destroyed. In a little-known essay entitled <span class="italic">On British Freedom</span> (1923) he made a spirited attack on the modern state's interference in matters of censorship, prohibition, and sexuality. He returned to political themes in <span class="italic">Civilization: an Essay</span> (1928), in which he characteristically upheld the superiority of spiritual values over material needs. However, his belief that these could flourish under the rule of dictators presaged his support for appeasement in the 1930s. &#145;Civilized&#146; was Bell's highest term of praise, and he maintained that it was best exemplified by the societies of Periclean Athens, fifteenth-century Florence, and France during the <i>grand si&egrave;cle</i>; but Virginia Woolf maliciously remarked of his book that &#145;in the end it turns out that civilization is a lunch party at No. 50 Gordon Square&#146;  (Q. Bell, <span class="italic">Bloomsbury</span>, 88).<br>
<br>During the 1920s Bell was frequently in Paris, often accompanied by his mistress at that time, the stylish hostess, patron, and writer Mary Hutchinson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnes (1889&#150;1977). He relished his contact there with artists&#151;especially Picasso and Andr&eacute; Derain, the leading exponent of fauvism&#151;musicians, and writers, and he was a witness at some of the great set piece occasions of that decade, such as the famous party given to celebrate the premi&egrave;re of Diaghilev's production of <span class="italic">Renard</span> in 1922 at which Stravinsky, Picasso, Proust, and James Joyce were among the guests. Between the wars he was the best-informed English commentator on the Parisian scene, which he brought alive in the pages of a number of journals, including the <span class="italic">New Republic</span> in America and <span class="italic">Vogue</span> in Britain. He always preferred the literature of France (particularly of the eighteenth century) to that of his own country; and his sympathetic study <span class="italic">Proust</span> (1928) was the first book in English on that author. Bell's Francophilia was sometimes a joke to his friends&#151;his speech and his letters were larded with French phrases&#151;and it was reported that he celebrated his appointment as a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1936 by addressing a bemused audience at Oxford in French.<br>
<br>In 1939 Bell gave up his London home at 50 Gordon Square and based himself at Charleston, the Sussex farmhouse which he shared with Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant. Thereafter he travelled regularly to France, where he renewed his friendships with Picasso and Matisse; and in 1950 he was invited to undertake a lecture tour of America. For the last twenty years of his life his devoted companion was Barbara Bagenal, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hiles (1891&#150;1984). In 1956 he published a collection of memoirs, <span class="italic">Old Friends</span>, which celebrated his friendships with the leading figures of his time on both sides of the channel, among them Walter Sickert, Maynard Keynes, T. S. Eliot, and Jean Cocteau. It was Bell's immense enthusiasm and passionate engagement with life that endeared him to his many friends. He was a noted host&#151;to David Garnett he seemed &#145;an almost perfect example of James Mill's Utilitarian theory that a man cannot become rich without enriching his neighbours&#146;  (Garnett, 24)&#151;and a welcome guest at a variety of salons. More sociable than most in his immediate circle, he never allowed his society to become exclusive or dull; his comparative wealth (which meant that he never had to earn a living) also ensured that it never lacked comfort. His talent for gossip, however, often got him into trouble; so too did his barely concealed snobbery. He was equally at home entertaining in London restaurants as he was tramping through the Sussex countryside in threadbare tweeds with his dog and a gun. But he was not without vanity, and his comic habits included &#145;the anxious rearrangement of the thick carroty hair that grew on only part of his cranium, and had a way of getting out of place, much to his agitation&#146;  (Partridge, 80). The portrait of him painted by Virginia Woolf in her diaries, in which he is often likened to a flamboyant and voluble parakeet, highlights his absurdities: and in the rehabilitation of Bloomsbury which occurred after his death his reputation alone did not flourish. Bell died at Fitzroy House Nursing Home, Fitzroy Square, London, on 17 September 1964, from cancer, and was cremated four days later at the West London crematorium.<br>
