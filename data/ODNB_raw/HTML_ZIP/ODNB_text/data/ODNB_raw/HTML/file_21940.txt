<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry</span>, Baron Percy of Alnwick  (<em>c.</em>1604&#150;1659), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21939/', "Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564&#150;1632)")</script>, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1619), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7568/', "Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex")</script>, and widow of Sir John Perrot. Henry was educated at a school in Isleworth under Thomas Willis; he subscribed at Christ Church, Oxford, on 7 December 1624.<br>
<br>Percy entered politics by representing Marlborough in the parliament of 1628&#150;9. When Charles I embarked upon his period of personal rule Percy naturally turned to the court for advancement. His early attempts to gain a &#145;place&#146;, first as secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer in March 1631 and afterwards to obtain the proprietorial command of a company in Thomas, Viscount Wentworth's, Irish army, both failed, but he did succeed in establishing himself within the circle of courtiers surrounding the queen, Henrietta Maria. As a royal favourite his career then prospered in a most gratifying manner, particularly as he was able to further the interests of his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21923/', "Algernon Percy, now tenth earl of Northumberland")</script>, and his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25525/', "Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1639 Percy was named a colonel in the army raised for the abortive war against the Scots. In October that year he also gained the extremely prestigious appointment of master of the horse to the prince of Wales, and in the following year he was appointed captain of the king's life guard. Returned as MP for the borough of Portsmouth in the Short Parliament, he rather more appropriately represented the county of Northumberland in the subsequent Long Parliament, until his progress was abruptly terminated by his involvement in the failed first army plot of March 1641. Unlike his late father James VI and I, Charles I was an enthusiastic but uniformly unsuccessful exponent of armed coups. In this particular case Percy, if not the originator, was certainly a chief conspirator in a scheme to bring the army down from the north into London in order to intimidate parliament, but upon the plot's being discovered he attempted to flee the country. Unfortunately he did not get very far, but was set upon by a mob in Sussex, beaten up, and forced into hiding. Badly frightened, he promptly presented his brother Northumberland with a detailed account of the conspiracy in return for his protection and immunity from prosecution. Percy claimed that he and his colleagues had merely been encouraging the army's officers to subscribe to an innocuous declaration of support for the king's policies. When at the king's instigation they had met Henry Jermyn and Sir John Suckling, whose parallel conspiracy did involve the use of armed force, Percy had opposed the more extreme plan and had reported back to the king who had vetoed it. This confession was enough to confirm parliament's suspicions and at the same time alienate Percy's erstwhile colleagues who unsurprisingly accused him of treachery. It was also, as he had hoped, sufficient to save him from impeachment and his only material punishment was his formal expulsion from the House of Commons on 9 December 1641.<br>
<br>However, now equally unpopular with both sides, Percy judged it expedient to retire to France. An inveterate schemer, he nevertheless began to make himself useful to the queen, who similarly found herself forced abroad as the political situation worsened, and in a complete reversal of fortune he returned to England as her agent. Rather ironically in the circumstances, the queen wrote &#145;I think him very faithful and that we may trust him&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Armed with that remarkable endorsement he was appointed general of the ordnance on 22 May 1643 and created Baron Percy of Alnwick on 28 June. He possessed no discernible military qualifications to justify this, apart from his vicarious employment as a colonel in 1639, but the post was actually an administrative one rather than a combat command. The ordnance department was primarily responsible for the procurement, manufacture, storage, transportation, and issue of a wide variety of military hardware including cannon, ammunition of all calibres, muskets, bandoliers, pikes, and even the more mundane items such as spades, pickaxes, duckboards, and buckets. Much of the credit for this onerous job generally goes to his indefatigable deputy, Sir John Heydon, but there is no doubt that Percy did in fact take his duties fairly seriously and once famously grumbled that the train of artillery was a sponge which sucked up money and could never be satisfied. Despite their best efforts Percy and Heydon never managed to keep up with the insatiable demand for ammunition and, on the night of 20 September 1643, Percy reported that the day's fighting in the first Battle of Newbury had consumed no fewer than an astounding eighty barrels of powder and that only ten remained for the artillery and none for the infantry. The royalist army had in effect run out of ammunition in the middle of the battle and thus forfeited the king's only realistic chance of winning the war.<br>
<br>In a more direct military role Percy had also become colonel of both a regiment of foot and a regiment of horse. The first had originally formed part of the escort to a large ammunition convoy, brought down from the north by Colonel Thomas Pinchbeck. Although most secondary sources state that these men came from Yorkshire, all the officers surviving in 1663 came from Northumberland so it is perhaps unsurprising that Percy should have taken them on. The origins of his regiment of horse are, however, rather more obscure. In 1644 Percy accompanied the king on the campaign which culminated in the victory at Cropredy Bridge on 29 June, and afterwards went with him into the west country, but on 14 August was unexpectedly forced to resign his post as general of the ordnance after being implicated in Lord Wilmot's plot to seek an accommodation with parliament. Initially he appears to have retained his regiments, but finally he lost them when he was arrested on 11 January 1645 on a charge of corresponding with the enemy. There seems no reason to doubt the truth of these charges, for not only was the outlook becoming increasingly bleak for the royalists, but Percy was also subject to conflicting family loyalties. Although, as a courtier, he was himself firmly attached to the queen's party, both his elder brother, Northumberland, and his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7566/', "Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex")</script>, were equally committed parliamentarians. It was perhaps in recognition of these difficult circumstances that Percy was released from custody a few weeks later, and having obtained a pass from his cousin, took ship for France where he once again rejoined the queen.<br>
<br>Despite being a favourite of the queen, he was, not surprisingly, distrusted by many of his fellow exiles. He was, perhaps rather hopefully, reported to have been wounded in a duel with Prince Rupert in March 1648, and was briefly arrested after a quarrel with Lord Colepeper in the following October. Nevertheless in time he mellowed and was appointed lord chamberlain and admitted to Charles II's &eacute;migr&eacute; privy council in 1653. Although this initially aroused considerable resentment in certain quarters he was subsequently reconciled with Edward Hyde (later earl of Clarendon) who dissuaded him from making his peace with the lord protector, Oliver Cromwell. Destined never to see England again, Percy died unmarried in France, probably in Paris, on 26 March 1659. Although Clarendon recorded that during the war &#145;he was generally unloved as a proud and supercilious person&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.393), he also praised his economical handling of the exiled king's household, and his tenure as general of the ordnance shows some genuine administrative ability.<br>
