<span class="headword">Marshal,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1165), <span class="occ">marshal</span>, son of Gilbert, marshal of Henry I, first appears in records when, with his father, he successfully defended the family's right to the marshalcy against rivals at some time in Henry I's reign. This plea occurred before 1130, as John was recorded in that year's pipe roll as paying for succession to his father's lands and office. He features by name as master marshal in the <span class="italic">Constitutio domus regis</span>, drawn up for Stephen in the early part of his reign, and he seems to have joined King Stephen soon after Henry I's death. He appears constantly in the king's charters between 1136 and 1138, and accompanied the king on his Norman tour of 1137. But there is no trace of him in Stephen's charters after the outbreak of rebellion in the west country. The annals of Winchester say that in 1138 he garrisoned the Wiltshire castles of Marlborough and Ludgershall, which he appears to have had at farm or in fee from Stephen. The king certainly came to regard him as a rebel, because John of Worcester notes that Stephen was conducting a siege of Marlborough when disturbed in September 1139 by news that the empress and Robert of Gloucester had landed in Sussex. In March 1140 a rogue mercenary, Robert fitz Hubert, was captured by John Marshal. The <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span> says that John Marshal was at this time a member of Gloucester's party, while John of Worcester believed that he was a supporter of the king. It may well be, then, that it was in his own interest that John was working, beginning to define a sphere of lordship in north Wiltshire and the Kennet valley.<br>
<br>After the capture of Stephen at Lincoln in February 1141, John appears unequivocally in the empress's following, at Oxford in July and at the siege of Winchester in August and September. He seems to have been that John &#145;supporter of the empress&#146; who, according to the continuator of John of Worcester's chronicle, was detached with a force to prevent the relief of Winchester. He was trapped at Wherwell Abbey which was set on fire around him. The verse biography of his son says that this incident cost him an eye, but is otherwise unreliable on the details. He remained firmly committed to the empress's cause after 1141; his brother, William Giffard, became the empress's chancellor. But his chief preoccupation seems to have been the extension of his power in Berkshire, where the abbey of Abingdon recorded him as one of its chief oppressors, and in Wiltshire, where he came into conflict with Patrick of Salisbury. In 1141 John acted with Patrick's elder brother, William of Salisbury, in the keeping of Wiltshire, but he had fallen out with the Salisbury family by 1145. The <span class="italic">Histoire de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span> preserves a number of stories deriving from this period of private warfare in Wiltshire between two Angevin supporters. However, it cannot disguise John Marshal's ultimate defeat, and the fact that he was forced to come to an agreement with Earl Patrick by which he divorced his first wife, Adelina (who later married an Oxfordshire landowner, Stephen Gay), and married the earl's sister, Sybil. John continued to support the Angevin party, appearing with Henry fitz Empress at Devizes in 1147 or 1149.<br>
<br>In 1152 it was the siege of John's forward post of Newbury in Berkshire that provoked the final crisis of Stephen's reign. Under pretext of negotiation, the Marshal (who was not in the castle) surrendered his son William to the king as hostage, but then abused the truce by running provisions and men into Newbury. When informed by the king's messenger that his son's death would follow from this, he is credited with the remark that he still had the hammers and anvil to make more and better sons. As it happened the humane king refused to execute William, and held him at court until the general peace was made the next year.<br>
<br>John Marshal remained prominent at Henry II's court in the first year or so of the new king's reign and was allowed to keep most of his gains from Stephen's reign, but it seems that he lost Ludgershall Castle. It probably reflects the general decline in his fortunes that he lost Marlborough Castle in 1158. In 1163 John Marshal was in disgrace; he had indiscreetly disclosed his belief that one of the prophecies of Merlin referred to Henry II and that the king would die before he could return to England. In 1164 John was involved in the persecution of Becket. He had been deprived of the manor of South Mundham in 1162, when the archbishop reclaimed all lands held of him at fee farm. When his suit to regain the manor failed in the archiepiscopal court, he appealed to the king, alleging unfair treatment. Henry II heard the case at the Council of Northampton in October 1164, and although John's case failed, grounds were found to turn the plea against Becket. John Marshal died in 1165, some time before Michaelmas. He was succeeded initially by his eldest sons, Gilbert and John, but the former died before Michaelmas 1166, leaving the entire estate and office of marshal to John, who was succeeded in turn (after 1194) by his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18126/', "William Marshal, later earl of Pembroke")</script>. The youngest of John Marshal's sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94379/', "Henry Marshal")</script>, later became bishop of Exeter.<br>
