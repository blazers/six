<span class="headword">Kennedy,  John</span>  (1819&#150;1884), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 15 August 1819 at the manse at Killearnan, Ross-shire, the son of John Kennedy, Church of Scotland minister of Killearnan and a close friend of John Macdonald of Ferintosh (the Apostle of the North), and his wife, Jessie, the daughter of Kenneth Mackenzie of Assynt, Sutherland. Their fourth son, he was educated at the parish school at Killearnan and at Aberdeen University, where he excelled in mental and moral science and chemistry, and graduated MA in 1840. He proceeded to the Theological Hall of the Church of Scotland in Aberdeen, and while there served as tutor in the family of Dr Henderson of Caskieben, Aberdeenshire. Licensed by the Church of Scotland Presbytery of Chanonry in September 1843 he, like his brother Donald, who succeeded his father at Killearnan, entered the ministry of the Free Church following the Disruption of that year.<br>
<br>In February 1844 Kennedy was inducted to his only pastorate, at Dingwall, Ross-shire. On 28 April 1848 he married Mary (1819&#150;1896), daughter of Major Forbes Mackenzie, at Fodderty. Of their four children, a girl and a boy died in infancy and twin daughters survived. Kennedy was in great demand as a preacher in both Gaelic and English&#151;hundreds of people attended when he participated in communion seasons&#151;and he was loved by young and old alike. P. Carnegie Simpson recalled that, &#145;As a preacher, he was a king to whom his pulpit was a throne. &hellip; His sermons were massive structures &hellip; but they literally glowed with Celtic fervour, and, as he poured them forth, he strained and soared heavenward, till at times he broke out at last into impassioned adoration&#146;  (P. C. Simpson, <span class="italic">The Life of Principal Rainy</span>, 1909, 1.442). He declined calls from Dunoon (1853), Australia (1854), Greenock (1857 and again in 1872), Tain (1857), and Renfield church, Glasgow (1863). In 1873 he became a DD (Aberdeen). Kennedy served as clerk to the presbytery of Dingwall and to the synod of Ross. During the winter of 1869&#150;70 his health broke down, and he was off duty for periods in 1872, 1873 (when he visited Canada and America, and was impressed by the prayers of Charles Hodge and disquieted by a sermon by Henry Ward Beecher which, he thought, emphasized the fatherhood of God at the expense of sin and the need of atonement), and 1881. On 17 May 1870 the Baptist Charles Spurgeon, whom Kennedy had met while recuperating in London, preached at the opening of the new Free Church building in Dingwall.<br>
<br>Kennedy's words, &#145;To be behind an age that is drifting away from truth and godliness is the only safe, the only dutiful position&#146;  (J. Kennedy, <span class="italic">The Present Cast and Tendency of Religious Thought and Feeling in Scotland</span>, 1902, 18), aptly indicate his stance. As his first book, <span class="italic">The Days of the Fathers in Ross-Shire</span> (1861), makes clear, he was for &#145;the old paths&#146;, and, though not unaware of their weaknesses, his admiration for earlier ministers and Men (a spiritual &eacute;lite in the highlands comprising elders, schoolmasters, catechists, and others of deep spiritual experience), who combined faith, experience, and practice, was deep and nostalgic; he lamented &#145;The fathers, where are they?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Days of the Fathers in Ross-Shire</span>, 84).<br>
<br>Though a reluctant controversialist, many of Kennedy's writings were polemical. He sided with James Begg, and during 1863&#150;73 led the highland opponents of the proposed union of the Free Church with the United Presbyterian church, both because of his commitment to the establishment over against the voluntary principle and because he suspected that the United Presbyterians were unsound on the doctrine of the atonement. He rebuked those who argued for the disestablishment of the Church of Scotland. He opposed the use in worship of &#145;uninspired hymns&#146; (hymns other than metrical renderings of biblical passages) and instrumental accompaniments to singing; the organized temperance movement; Sunday schools; age- and sex-specific church organizations; soir&eacute;es; Plymouthism&#151;&#145;the slimiest of all isms&#146;; the critical views of W. Robertson Smith; and the opening of the Highland Railway on Sundays. His theological position is summed up in <span class="italic">Man's Relations to God Traced in the Light of &#145;the Present Trends&#146;</span> (1869), and his homiletic method is exemplified in his posthumous <span class="italic">Expository Lectures</span> (1911). No arch-Calvinist who would offer the gospel to &#145;sensible sinners&#146; only, Kennedy was no rampant evangelist either, being stoutly opposed to the methods of such revivalists as Dwight L. Moody: he relied on God's enabling grace to draw sinners to the Christ freely offered in the gospel.<br>
<br>On his way home from a visit to Italy, Kennedy died at Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, on 28 April 1884, and was buried in the grounds of the Free Church in Dingwall on 1 May, more than sixty ministers and thousands of people being in attendance.<br>
