<span class="headword">Rostal,  Max</span>  (1905&#150;1991), <span class="occ">violinist and music teacher</span>, was born on 7 August 1905 in Teschen, Silesia. Nothing is known of his Jewish parents, but he began the violin when aged five, gave a public concert the next year, and toured as a child prodigy. He studied under Arnold Ros&eacute; in Vienna until he was twelve and then spent a formative four years under Carl Flesch at the Berlin Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik. Flesch thought him outstanding and in 1922 had him make his d&eacute;but. Another pupil of Flesch, Boris Schwarz, heard Rostal play in the master's studio in 1923 and &#145;found the finish and panache of his performance truly amazing&#146;  (Schwarz, 341). In 1925 Rostal won the Mendelssohn prize in Berlin. He then toured as a soloist and led his own quartet, and he was also leader of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra until 1928. As he was interested in teaching he became Flesch's assistant in Berlin, and in 1930 he was given his own class, which made him the youngest professor there.<br>
<br>Because of the Nazi regime Rostal left Berlin in 1934 and emigrated to Britain, where he settled in London and taught privately. A brilliant violinist with a superb technique, rich vibrant tone, and fine musicianship, he made a reputation throughout the country as a soloist and chamber musician and formed excellent duos with the pianists Franz Osborn and, from 1954, Colin Horsley. The fiery temperament of his youth gave way to a more thoughtful and intellectual approach, always with complete fidelity to the composer.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Rostal remained in London giving concerts&#151;frequently at Dame Myra Hess's series at the National Gallery&#151;and recitals for the forces and factory workers. He also ran a small string orchestra to facilitate teaching the performance of chamber music. After the war he became a naturalized British subject.<br>
<br>Rostal's greatest achievement was as a teacher. Much sought after, he trained many excellent musicians, including both the violinists and the viola player who formed the famous Amadeus Quartet, which made its d&eacute;but in January 1948. His teaching was based on that of his own teacher Carl Flesch, who had formulated a rational and logical course of training to give students a sound technical foundation and to have a sincere and thoughtful musical approach to their interpretations. From 1944 to 1958 he was professor at the Guildhall School of Music in London. A champion of modern music, Rostal gave premi&egrave;res of concertos written for him by Alan Bush, Benjamin Frankel (1951), Franz Reizenstein, and Bernard Stevens, among other works. Then in 1957, despite his success in England, he unexpectedly left to take the masterclass at the Cologne Academy of Music (where he remained until 1982) and played in a piano trio. Also, from 1958 to 1985 he was violin professor at the conservatory in Bern, where he lived, commuting to Cologne.<br>
<br>In 1974, together with Yehudi Menuhin and others, Rostal founded the European String Teachers' Association to exchange information on the technique and teaching of string playing; he was its president for the next fifteen years. He was appointed CBE in 1977. His first two marriages, to the cellist Sela Trau and to Caroline Hohenblum, were dissolved, leaving a daughter from each, and in 1980 he married Maria Busato. He made some excellent recordings, published <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Interpretation of Beethoven's Violin Sonatas</span> (1981) and some teaching compositions, and edited many violin works. He owned a 1697 Stradivarius violin, later known as the &#145;Max Rostal&#146;, a 1733 Guarnerius del Ges&ugrave; &#145;Charles Reade&#146;, and a Giuseppe Guadagnini viola. In addition he collected first editions of music and French impressionist paintings.<br>
<br>Rostal was a very independent-minded man with a vigorous sense of humour, who loved to drive powerful cars. According to his pupil Yfrah Neaman, he &#145;was a warm and generous human being, always ready to help out a young talent. Countless violinists around the world owe him a debt of deepest gratitude&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Rostal died on 6 August 1991 at Bern, Switzerland, survived by his wife.<br>
