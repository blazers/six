<span class="headword">Balfour,  Edward Green</span>  (1813&#150;1889), <span class="occ">surgeon and naturalist</span>, was born on 6 September 1813 in Montrose, the second son of Captain George Balfour of the East India Company marine service, and Susan Hume, a sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14148/', "Joseph Hume MP")</script>. After studying at the Montrose Academy, Balfour went to Edinburgh where he studied surgery at the university. He was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1833 and a year later set sail for India, where a family friend had arranged for a commission as an assistant surgeon in the Madras medical service. Balfour's voyage to India was delayed by a visit to the island of Mauritius, where he was able to observe at first hand the ecological destruction about which French naturalists had written. This kindled in him a lifelong interest in what he believed was a direct relationship between deforestation, climatic change, and environmental degradation.<h2>
<a name="India"></a>India</h2>On arrival in India Balfour was attached to a European regiment. However, rapid progress first in Hindustani and later in Persian brought him to the attention of his superiors and he was soon transferred to a regiment of sepoy infantry. Sepoy regiments, unlike European ones, moved frequently between stations and were more likely to be posted to the smaller cantonments, and Balfour accordingly spent most of the next ten years travelling about southern India. His interest in environmental change and its relationship to human societies was further provoked and he was able to collect a great body of information which would serve as the basis for a string of articles and books on health and the environment in India. These writings brought him to the attention of the government. His article entitled &#145;On the influence exercised by trees on the climate of a country&#146; (1849), in which he argued that tree felling in southern India lay behind recent climatic change, was employed by the government of Madras in its efforts to persuade the East India Company to allow it to impose a stricter conservation regime in its territories. This work also made an impact upon the newly arrived governor-general of India, Lord Dalhousie, who was persuaded of the need for tighter forestry controls.<br>
<br>In 1848 Balfour returned to the presidency capital where he was given medical charge of the governor's bodyguard. While this was a prestigious appointment, it did not entail much regimental duty and Balfour could devote a substantial amount of his time to his writings and his other interests. The reduced medical demands also enabled him to take up an appointment as agent to the court of the nawab of the Carnatic, which eventually culminated in his serving from 1858 to 1861 on a commission called to look into the nawab's debts. He also served briefly in 1850 as assistant assay master at the Madras mint.<br>
<br>Even when faced with these extensive outside commitments Balfour continued to keep up his medical career, and in 1852 he was promoted to the rank of full surgeon. This year also saw his marriage on 24 May to Marion Matilda Agnes Gilchrist, the daughter of a fellow surgeon on the Madras establishment. Their first and apparently only child, Edith, was born on 28 June 1861. Following his promotion Balfour filled a number of staff positions in Madras, Mysore, Burma, and Hyderabad, and in 1871 his talents and lengthy service were rewarded when he was promoted to the highest ranking medical post in the presidency, that of surgeon-general. He held this position until his departure from India in 1876.<h2>
<a name="Environmentandsociety"></a>Environment and society</h2>Balfour was clearly a polymath whose writings spanned topics as diverse as forestry, Persian poetry, cholera, and indigenous medical knowledge. Nevertheless, certain patterns can be discerned in his work. Most significant perhaps is the connection he identified between forests, climatic change, famine, and the outbreak of diseases. The importance he attached to this relationship stemmed partly from his medical training in Edinburgh where the impact of environmental factors on human health had been stressed, partly from his readings of French physiocrats as well as the works of Alexander von Humboldt and Joseph Priestley, and partly from his firsthand observations in Mauritius and in India. Balfour's major work on forestry was <span class="italic">The timber trees, timber and fancy woods, as also the forests of India and of eastern and southern Asia</span>, which was first published in 1858. In 1863 the government of India had set up a timber-purchasing agency in Burma, largely on the recommendation of the military finance department, which coincidentally had been headed by Balfour's brother <a href="#cosubject_1187">George [<i>see below</i>]</a> until 1862. The government's expanded presence in commercial forestry led it to pressurize Balfour to bring out a second edition, which provided a more comprehensive listing of the types of trees to be found in India and their possible commercial use. A third edition appeared in 1870. Balfour's insistence that the state should take on a greater role in policing and preserving India's forests was instrumental in pushing the British administration in India into taking up a more proactive conservationist role, and hence we can conclude that Balfour was one of the most important figures in nineteenth-century environmentalism.<br>
<br>Balfour's environmental efforts cannot, however, be separated from his views of society, and here again Balfour shared many characteristics with the French physiocrats. In particular he accepted that the state had a major role to play in engineering necessary or desirable social change. Like many of his contemporaries, Balfour held fairly fixed views as to what denoted proper social organization and productive economic activity, and again like many of his contemporaries he believed that statistics were a crucial tool in determining benchmarks and in guiding policy. In the case of forest conservation, Balfour not only singled out agriculturists, landowners, and timber merchants as contributing to deforestation, he also emphasized what he saw as the destructiveness of India's tribal population. He insisted that their &#145;slash and burn&#146; style of agriculture was responsible for the destruction of large stands of timber. Hitherto tribal communities had been stereotyped as unproductive; Balfour and his readers could now argue on the basis of what was presented as scientific evidence that tribal societies were inherently destructive. This helped to justify demands that tribal societies be disciplined and reformed.<br>
<br>Balfour also employed statistics to make judgements on how best to preserve the health of Europeans in India. In works such as &#145;Statistical data for forming troops and maintaining them in health in different climates and localities&#146; (<span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Statistical Society of London</span>, 8, 1845, 192&#150;209), <span class="italic">Statistics of Cholera</span> (1849), and &#145;Remarks on the abstract tables of the men discharged from the military&#146; (<span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Statistical Society of London</span>, 14, 1851, 348&#150;56), which was read by his uncle, Joseph Hume, to the Statistical Society of London, Balfour spoke out against the common belief in &#145;seasoning&#146;, the idea that given enough time humans will adjust to new climates. He believed instead that different races had different tolerances for climates and diseases. The statistics he accumulated suggested that Europeans fared better at higher altitudes and he accordingly became a champion of locating asylums and cantonments in the hills of India. Balfour also chaired a committee which in 1853 published the <span class="italic">Barometrical Survey of India</span>.<br>
<br>Arguably, Balfour's most influential work was his <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of India and Southern Asia</span>, which was first published in Madras in 1857. It had been compiled from the notes he had taken when organizing exhibitions of local items for display at London's Great Exhibition. His accumulation of further information led him to release a second edition in Madras in 1871. The second edition, which was largely self-funded, had almost triple the number of entries. Sales were good and he managed to recoup his investment within a few years. The third edition was again larger and this time it was published in Britain where it was favourably reviewed. It was a mammoth undertaking, containing entries on historical and mythological figures, the flora and fauna of India, castes, historical battles, soil types, diseases, minerals, major texts, marriage customs, and towns and villages. It also provided definitions of some of the more common words from the major vernaculars. There is even a lengthy entry on himself as well as one for his brother George.<h2>
<a name="AdvocateofmuseumsIndianlanguageandliterature"></a>Advocate of museums; Indian language and literature</h2>Edward Balfour's commitment to collecting and organizing information on India led to his appointment as secretary to the committees called to prepare Madras's contributions to the Great Exhibition of 1851, the Paris exhibitions of 1855 and 1868, the Universal Exhibition of London in 1862, and the Vienna Exhibition of 1873. In addition, much of the material he collected was used to stock the government central museum in Madras, which had been founded in 1850 with Balfour as superintendent. He held this post until 1859. Balfour passionately believed that museums were an ideal medium through which useful information could be communicated to the people of India. He had initially envisaged a network of museums across southern India. The plan was for six satellite museums to be located in various regions of the presidency with the main museum in Madras serving as a central repository. However, the outlying museums quickly faltered and by 1861 there remained only one at Rajahmundry and it had been turned over to district authorities. Despite these setbacks the museum in Madras became one of the most popular museums in India, particularly through such innovations as setting aside special days when only women would be admitted. By 1879 the museum was attracting just under 180,000 people per year and by 1886 this figure had risen to 230,000. Balfour was particularly pleased at the number of visitors who were apparently illiterate, for this confirmed his faith in the museum as a means for public instruction. At the outset the museum had an unmistakably utilitarian purpose&#151;most of the collection consisted of items of commercial value. In one surviving document of 1851 it was described as a museum of practical and economic geology. To these collections Balfour added samples of all the woods of India which he had been able to acquire. Only later were archaeological and ethnological items added. Balfour's enthusiasm for collecting can also be glimpsed in the Madras Zoological Gardens, which he helped to found in 1856. Also, in 1866, he had a hand in establishing a museum in Mysore.<br>
<br>While Balfour is best-known for his work in scientific disciplines, he did maintain an interest in Indian languages and literature. In 1850 he published <span class="italic">Gul-Dastah, or, The Bunch of Roses</span>, which consisted of his translations of a number of works by Indian and Persian poets. Credit for the erection of the Muhammadan Public Library in Madras can also be assigned in part to Balfour. He translated several English works on astronomy into Hindustani and a statistical map of the world into Hindustani, Tamil, and Telugu. Yet despite his knowledge of Hindustani and Persian, which was sufficiently advanced that he continued to serve as interpreter to the government on many occasions, Balfour was very sceptical of the state of indigenous scientific knowledge. In the preface to the first edition of the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span>, he insisted that indigenous people are so close to subsistence level that they do not have the means or the freedom to reflect accurately upon their surroundings.<br>
<br>Balfour's final years in India were marked by a number of initiatives he took in an effort to make Western medicine more accessible to the peoples of India. He personally translated an English midwifery manual into Hindustani and arranged for it to appear in Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada, and in 1871 he urged (unsuccessfully) the Madras government to establish five vernacular medical schools: two in Telugu-speaking areas, two in Tamil-speaking areas, and one in the Malayalam-speaking region. He also published a description of medical discoveries and recent lessons that was entitled <span class="italic">Medical Hints to the People of India</span>. He intended that this book would inspire Indians studying Western medicine as well as win over practitioners of traditional medicine (<i>vaids</i> and <i>hakims</i>) to Western medical practices. Balfour's other great initiative was to try to open up medical opportunities for European women in India. He had long recognized that their maleness prevented European doctors from penetrating into the domestic spaces of Indian society. In contrast, European women would be able to move more freely within a large segment of Indian society. His lobbying of the government and the medical establishment in Madras began in 1872 and his first success came in 1875 when Mary Scharlieb was admitted to the Madras Medical College as its first woman applicant. Scharlieb, the wife of a barrister in Madras, had been trained as a midwife but found midwifery too constraining. Her entry into the Madras Medical College cleared the way for other women applicants.<br>
<br>Balfour continued to write about India following his retirement and return to England in 1876. The outbreak of the Deccan famine of 1877&#150;9 and its horrific death toll prompted him to return to the subject of deforestation and climatic change. This resulted in his book <span class="italic">Indian Forestry</span>, which appeared in 1885. He also brought out revised editions of some of his earlier works, notably his <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span>, and a book on agricultural pests. Balfour died on 8 December 1889 at 107 Gloucester Terrace, London. He was survived by his wife. Balfour was a major figure in Britain's scientific encounter with India, and his researches into a number of areas, including botany and public health, became standard reading for several generations of scholars, surgeons, and administrators. However, he never received the attention many felt he merited. There was no knighthood, nor was he the subject of a biography. D. G. Crawford, the historian of the Indian Medical Service, was sensitive to this slight, and argued that had Balfour been stationed in India at a later date, when India featured more prominently in British public life, he would not have been so overlooked.<br>
<br>Edward Balfour's elder brother <a name="cosubject_1187"></a><span class="headword">Sir George Balfour</span>  (1809&#150;1894), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born in Montrose, and studied at the Montrose Academy and the East India Company's Addiscombe College. He entered the Madras artillery in 1825. He transferred to the Royal Artillery in the following year but continued to serve in India where he first saw action with the Malacca field force in 1832&#150;3. Promotion to captain came in 1844, major and lieutenant-colonel in 1854, colonel in 1855, major-general in 1865, lieutenant-general in 1874, and general in 1877. His administrative skills and particularly his detailed knowledge of military accounts led to his appointment as a staff officer with the Madras force during the war with China in 1840&#150;42. The commander of that expedition, Henry Pottinger, was so impressed with Balfour's handling of the indemnity levied against the defeated Chinese that Balfour was appointed to serve as British consul at Shanghai; he served from 1843 to 1846. Shanghai was one of the treaty ports which the Chinese had reluctantly agreed to open under the terms of the treaty of Nanking (Nanjing). Balfour proved to be quite successful in negotiating with the Chinese. While he was thought to be of insufficient rank to merit an audience with the provincial governor, he did meet frequently with the highest-ranking official in Shanghai, the <i>taotai</i> or intendant, with whom he established excellent working relations. Balfour's military rank no doubt helped, for it invested him with greater stature than would have accrued had he been simply a merchant as was the case with other consuls in India. Balfour reinforced this impression by emphasizing diplomatic relations and protocol, even at the expense of commercial transactions. It was during Balfour's time in Shanghai that the area of international settlement was laid down. It began initially with his purchase of land amounting to 150 acres. This was done without the prior approval of the government and was partly funded by his own money. Balfour was, however, convinced of the long-term importance of Shanghai as a point of entry into the vast interior markets of China.<br>
<br>British relations with Chinese officials during his time in Shanghai were also facilitated by Balfour's willingness to take a hard line on the opium trade. Opium was a banned product in China, and while consuls could do little about opium trading occurring outside their jurisdiction, many would also turn a blind eye to that being carried out under their noses. Balfour co-operated with Chinese authorities in seeking to interdict the trade. On one occasion he used British sailors to board a British merchant vessel; once aboard they discovered several bales of opium, which were thrown over the side, and those in charge of the ship were fined. He also sought to prevent conflict by limiting European movement outside the city to journeys of no more than one day's ride. He left Shanghai in 1846 after a disagreement with his superiors as to whether he was entitled to maintain his position in the army lists. A furlough in Britain resulted in his marriage in 1848 to his cousin Charlotte Isabella Hume, the third daughter of Joseph Hume. It is not clear whether they had children.<br>
<br>In late 1848 Balfour returned to Madras, where he served in a number of administrative positions. These included a spell on the military board from 1849 to 1857 which brought him to the attention of the governor-general. He was consequently appointed to the military finance commission, which had been formed to look into India-wide economies in the aftermath of the revolt. He gained a reputation for &#145;obstinate ability&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 March 1894), though his &#145;largely generous nature&#146; prevented him from lapsing into complete &#145;obstinacy&#146;. His command over detail led to his appointment as chief of the military finance department from 1860 to 1862. He returned to England where he served on the royal commission on recruiting in 1866 and in 1868&#150;70, and in 1868 he was appointed assistant to the controller-in-chief, war department, a post he held until 1871.<br>
<br>Balfour then turned to politics and sat as the Liberal MP for Kincardineshire from December 1872 until 1892. His parliamentary career was, however, far from distinguished. While in principle an advocate of Irish land reforms and home rule, he spoke rarely in parliament and generally failed to attract much attention: significantly, he only merited one entry in Gladstone's diary and that was in 1866, six years before his election as a Liberal MP. He made a somewhat greater impact outside parliament. In letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which were later collected together and printed as <span class="italic">Trade and Salt in India Free</span> (1875), Balfour argued for the abolition of duties on most goods imported into India as well as the abolition of taxes on the production and selling of salt. He reasoned that not only did these taxes hamper economic growth, they antagonized the population of India which might ultimately weaken British rule from within, should British India ever be threatened from without. Four years earlier he had written to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to criticize some of their correspondent's facts on Indian budgetary affairs. Balfour was also convinced by the deforestation arguments of his brother, and in 1866 he took exception to several papers delivered to the Royal Geographical Society which were critical of Edward's work in this area. George Balfour was made CB in 1874 and KCB in 1870. He died in London on 12 March 1894 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
