<span class="headword">Browne,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1608&#150;1691), <span class="occ">parliamentary official</span>, was the only child of Thomas Browne (<i>d</i>. 1621), citizen and grocer of London, and his wife, Joan, whose surname may have been Wilson. He belonged to a family which originated at Bury St Edmunds. On his father's death in 1621 he was adopted by his uncle John Browne, a merchant tailor, from whom he eventually inherited a substantial fortune. He was admitted a student by the Middle Temple on 28 October 1628 but was not called to the bar. On 13 March 1638 he was appointed clerk of the parliaments. Parliament was then dissolved and he did not enter fully upon his duties as clerk of the House of Lords until the assembly of the Short Parliament in April 1640.<br>
<br>Browne was a firm adherent of the parliamentarian cause and following the final break between the king and parliament in 1642 he remained at Westminster to serve the House of Lords there. The abolition of the house in March 1649 deprived him of his employment until the Restoration. On 25 June 1650 the House of Commons ordered the records of the House of Lords in Browne's custody to be delivered to Henry Scobell, whom they had appointed their clerk and designated clerk of the parliaments. However, at the first meeting of the convention on 25 April 1660 the House of Lords ordered Scobell to return the records to Browne, who was reinstated as clerk of the parliaments, making a declaration of loyalty to Charles II on 30 May. He served the house for a further thirty years until his death.<br>
<br>Although not a profound scholar like some of his immediate predecessors Browne consolidated their work during his long term of office by bringing order and regularity to the procedure of the House of Lords. His reputation as a record-keeper has, however, suffered due to the loss through his agency of the Braye and Nalson manuscripts from the archives of the house. Browne was much interested in music and accumulated a large collection of musical manuscripts. He also acquired a considerable amount of property, mainly in Northamptonshire where his principal seat, Eydon, lay and possessed a house in Twickenham in addition to his official residence in the palace of Westminster.<br>
<br>Browne was twice married. His first wife was Temperance, third daughter of Sir Thomas Crew of Steane, Northamptonshire, speaker of the House of Commons in 1623 and 1625. They were childless and she died on 22 September 1634, aged twenty-five. His second wife, whom he married on 28 January 1636, was Elizabeth, daughter of John Packer of Shillingford, Berkshire, clerk of the privy seal and secretary to George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham; the marriage produced two daughters. Browne was buried at Eydon on 8 June 1691 and his second wife five days later.<br>
