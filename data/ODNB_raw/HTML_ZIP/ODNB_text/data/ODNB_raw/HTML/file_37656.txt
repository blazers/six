<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Larkin,  James</span>  (1874&#150;1947), <span class="occ">labour leader in Ireland</span>, was born on 4 February 1874 at 41 Combermere Street, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, the second of the six children of James Larkin (1845&#150;1887), a forge labourer, and his wife, Mary Ann McNulty (1842&#150;1911). His parents were part of that vast exodus from Ireland who took their place at the bottom of the English social pyramid. James Larkin, therefore, was brought up in poverty, received only a few years' formal schooling, watched his father die of tuberculosis in 1887, and was thrown on to a brutal labour market. He joined the Toxteth branch of the Independent Labour Party in 1892, and was converted to socialism. In summer 1893 he stowed away to escape unemployment and to find adventure, but returned to Liverpool the following year to take his place again among that vast army of casuals who prowled the docks in search of a day's work. He eventually found regular work as a docker, and was soon promoted to dock foreman. By 1903 he was earning &pound;3 10<i>s</i>. a week and decided to marry. He had been keeping company for some time with Elizabeth Brown, whose father managed a working-class restaurant in Liverpool and was a Baptist lay preacher. Larkin courted Elizabeth by taking her to socialist meetings and speaking engagements, though she never expressed any real interest in socialism. They were married on 8 September 1903 in a civil ceremony in Liverpool, and eventually had four sons.<br>
<br>When his men went out on strike in summer 1905 Larkin joined them and became their leader. Though the strike was lost he was asked to become a full-time organizer for the National Union of Dock Labourers. He quickly organized in the Scottish ports, and was then assigned to the more difficult task of doing the same in Ireland. Soon after his arrival in 1907 Larkin was involved in a series of strikes in Belfast, Cork, and Dublin, which the executive of the National Union was reluctant to support. Larkin then broke with the National Union and founded the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union late in 1908; he was the union's secretary and edited its paper, the <span class="italic">Irish Worker and People's Advocate</span>. Larkin's imprisonment on a charge of embezzlement of strike funds did not prevent the union from rapidly gaining in numbers and strength: by 1913 it was the largest and most militant union in Ireland. The building of the Transport Union, which laid the foundations of the Irish labour movement, was undoubtedly much assisted by Larkin's oratorical skills and charisma, and was the most creative achievement of his long life. Larkin believed that it was a union's responsibility to do more than merely wring better wages, hours, and conditions from reluctant employers. For him, the union was a revolutionary instrument through which he could effect not only economic change, but also a profound social transformation in Irish society.<br>
<br>During summer 1913 Larkin decided to consolidate his formidable power base in Dublin by challenging the financier William Martin Murphy, whom he had demonized for several years as Dublin's arch-capitalist. Larkin began by organizing among the workers of Murphy's Dublin United Transway Company, and declared a strike in August 1913 in response to victimization. Murphy retaliated by organizing a Dublin Employers' Federation of some 400 strong, who locked out union members and those who refused to pledge never to join. The upshot was an epic struggle that lasted six months and involved 20,000 workers, during which Larkin was once more briefly imprisoned. The Dublin workers were able to sustain themselves only because of massive support from the British labour movement, which contributed &pound;150,000 in money and food. In the midst of the lock-out Larkin launched a crusade in Britain to induce the British labour leadership to declare a general strike in support of the Dublin workers. The British Trades Union Congress met in London early in December 1913 to consider the matter, but after an acrimonious debate rejected the Larkinite proposal by more than ten to one. In February 1914 the workers were finally obliged to surrender, and returned to work on the employers' terms. The Transport Union was decimated in numbers and financially ruined, but this did not prevent Larkin from assuming the presidency of the Irish Trades Union Congress. The struggle also had the effect of making him an international figure: by 1914 &#145;Larkin&#146; and &#145;Larkinism&#146; had become household words in Britain, and in America too, the left wing had taken him up as a prime example of a socialist of the meat-eating and syndicalist variety. Even Lenin had been impressed by Larkin's revolutionary posture in 1913. With the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 Larkin cemented his international reputation as a revolutionary socialist by immediately and unequivocally denouncing it as a capitalist plot.<br>
<br>In order to raise the funds necessary to rebuild the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, Larkin decided to visit America, leaving the union in the hands of his deputy, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37308/', "James Connolly")</script>. He sailed for the United States in late October 1914 and expected to be away for only a short time, but in the event it was nearly nine years before he finally returned to Ireland. While in America, Larkin was by turns a lecturer, a union organizer, a German secret agent, an Irish propagandist, a socialist agitator, a founder of the American Communist Party, and finally a &#145;martyred&#146; political prisoner who served nearly three years in prison. Two overriding themes, however, gave some coherence and consistency to what otherwise seem disparate activities. The first was his implacable opposition to the First World War, and the second was his enthusiastic acceptance of the Russian revolution in November 1917. Both these stands, especially after the United States entered the war in April 1917, were very unpopular, and when the celebrated &#145;red scare&#146; followed hard on the heels of the end of the war Larkin was arrested on the charge of criminal anarchy in late 1919. He was then tried, convicted, and sentenced to five to ten years in prison.<br>
<br>Shortly after he was pardoned by Governor Alfred E. Smith early in 1923 in the interests of free speech Larkin was deported to Ireland. On his return home in May 1923 he found that the successful war against the British had degenerated into a fratricidal civil war, and he immediately called for peace. Within a month of his return, however, a fierce struggle for power broke out in the Transport Union, which soon extended to the Irish labour movement as a whole. The eventual result was that Larkin was suspended as general secretary of the union and finally expelled. He then founded the Workers' Union of Ireland, but was able to carry with him only a remnant of the Transport Union, mainly those members based in Dublin. Larkin's power and influence in the Irish labour movement were also greatly impaired by his open and continued support for Soviet communism. In summer 1924 he visited Moscow to attend the Fifth Congress of the Third International, or Comintern, and was elected to represent Ireland on the twenty-five-member executive council which governed that body between congresses. He was elected a member of the D&aacute;il in 1926, but was unable to take his seat because he was an undischarged bankrupt. He was again elected to the D&aacute;il and served in 1937&#150;8, and 1943&#150;4. After 1928 he began to drift out of the communist orbit, though he never repudiated his earlier affiliations. With the advent of the great depression in 1929 Larkin's power and influence were further impaired on both the trade union and political sides of the labour movement. Though his political fortunes revived slightly in the 1940s, when he managed to secure the dilution of anti-trade union legislation sponsored by De Valera, he remained a marginal figure in Irish politics until he died in Meath Street Hospital, Dublin, on 30 January 1947. He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery on 2 February.<br>
