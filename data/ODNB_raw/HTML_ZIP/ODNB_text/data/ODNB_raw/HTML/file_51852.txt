<span class="headword">Poole,  Reginald Lane</span>  (1857&#150;1939), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at home at 4 Hereford Road, Paddington, London, on 29 March 1857, the younger son and second of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22512/', "Edward Stanley Poole (1830&#150;1867)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22522/', "Poole, Sophia Lane")</script>], civil servant and Arabic scholar, and Roberta Elizabeth Louisa (1828&#150;1866), daughter of Charles Reddelien, a naturalized German merchant. After the early deaths of their parents the children were brought up by their grandmother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22522/', "Sophia Poole")</script> and her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15990/', "Edward William Lane")</script>, the orientalist. Reginald and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35569/', "Stanley Edward Lane-Poole")</script> were educated privately by classical tutors and were taught Arabic and Hebrew by their great-uncle.<br>
<br>The atmosphere in their home at Worthing was one of evangelical religion and oriental learning. In 1874 Reginald went up to Balliol College, Oxford, as a commoner. At this time his main interest was in Hebrew, which was then studied in the honour school of theology. During his first term he won the Busby theological prize at Balliol, and shortly afterwards he was elected to a Hody Hebrew exhibition at Wadham College, to which he migrated. He spent the long vacation of 1876 at Leiden over a translation from the Dutch of Land's <span class="italic">Principles of Hebrew Grammar</span>, which was published the same year. In 1877 he returned to Balliol to read modern history under J. F. Bright and William Stubbs. His classes in the schools, a third in classical moderations (1876) and seconds in theology (1878) and modern history (1879), by no means represented his intellectual quality, and in 1879 he won the Lothian prize with an essay subsequently published as <span class="italic">The History of the Huguenots of the Dispersion</span> (1880).<br>
<br>In 1880 Poole was appointed as assistant in the department of manuscripts at the British Museum, but he resigned the post in 1881 on being awarded a Hibbert travelling scholarship. On 4 August 1881, shortly before leaving for Leipzig under the terms of the scholarship, he married <a href="#cosubject_51852">Rachael Emily Malleson [<i>see below</i>]</a> with whom he was to have two daughters and two sons; their youngest child was Austin Lane Poole (1889&#150;1963), historian and president of St John's College, Oxford, from 1947 to 1957. Poole's early marriage and consequent inability to live in college were, more than his examination record, probably the chief reasons for his not being elected to a college fellowship until long afterwards. In 1882 he took the degree of PhD at Leipzig and published the first of his numerous contributions to the history of music, <span class="italic">Sebastian Bach</span>. After a year in Z&uuml;rich, he published some of the results of his studies in his <span class="italic">Illustrations of the History of Medieval Thought</span> (1884; 2nd edn, 1920), which had a significant influence in encouraging the study of medieval scholarship and political thought in England.<br>
<br>In 1883 Poole returned to England and settled in Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his life. From 1886 to 1910 he was a lecturer at Jesus College; from 1898 to 1933 he was a research fellow, and from 1933 an honorary fellow, of Magdalen College; from 1896 to 1927 he was university lecturer in diplomatic; and from 1909 to 1927 he was keeper of the university archives. His election to the keepership coincided with a revision of the university's archives statute that redefined the functions of the office. Poole resented these changes and protested against them; he described them in <span class="italic">The Delegacy of Privileges and the Keepership of the Archives: a Letter to the Vice-Chancellor</span> (privately printed, 1909), as a &#145;glaring falsification of history&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Delegacy of Privileges</span>, 6). He also disagreed with several of his predecessors in his very narrow definition of what should constitute archives and in his <span class="italic">Lecture on the History of the University Archives</span> (1912), he lamented &#145;the fatal inability of Keepers to destroy things when they are done with&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lecture on the History of the University Archives</span>, 5).<br>
<br>The focus of the greater part of Poole's professional life was the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, established in 1886, of which he was successively assistant editor (1886&#150;95), joint editor (1895&#150;1901), and sole editor (1901&#150;20). His high standards, exact editorial method, and responsiveness to the needs of the emerging historical profession, in the development of which the <span class="italic">Review</span> itself played a part, established its identity and reputation. Poole's influence as editor was far-reaching and not limited to his selection of articles, which he would sometimes improve to the point of rewriting, and generosity in sharing knowledge with contributors, especially those junior to him; under him the <span class="italic">Review</span> became an informal training ground for young historians and, owing to his wide range of contacts throughout Europe, the origin of networks of communication between researchers in related fields. The heavy burden of its production, the main part of which Poole carried from its foundation, prevented him from writing substantial works of his own, but his output of articles, editions, and calendars of manuscripts was very large. The <span class="italic">Lectures on the History of the Papal Chancery</span>, which he delivered as Birkbeck lecturer in Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1912/1913 and published in 1915, forms his largest single contribution to the study of diplomatic history.<br>
<br>A full bibliography of Poole's works to 1927, in which year his edition of John of Salisbury's <span class="italic">Historia pontificalis</span> was published, is printed in the volume <span class="italic">Essays in History</span>, presented to him to celebrate his seventieth birthday. His health was then already failing, and for several years at the end of his life he was unable to leave his house. An important collection of his <span class="italic">Studies in Chronology and History</span> was edited by his son in 1934. Elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1904, Poole received in his later years many academic honours, including honorary doctorates from Oxford, Cambridge, Louvain, and Leipzig.<br>
<br>Poole's great learning was based on hard work and an exceptional memory. He had an instinct for tracing the connections of related facts in widely disparate fields, and for systematizing his wide-ranging knowledge. He read Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic with ease, as well as at least five modern European languages. He knew not only medieval Europe, but also the older literatures in which medieval Europeans were versed. His earlier studies were in the field of the history of ideas, but as he grew older his precise knowledge of chronology and the forms of documents increasingly formed the basis of his researches.<br>
<br>Slightly built, of medium height and upright carriage, Poole was a most entertaining, and at times pungent, talker, who delighted in the amenities of civilized academic life, and especially in the historic traditions of Magdalen and of his university offices. From his middle age he was strongly conservative in all his views and &#145;settled down into a steady churchmanship of the old-fashioned Anglican type&#146;  (Webb, 320). He died at his home, 19 Banbury Road, Oxford, on 28 October 1939 from cystitis and enlargement of the prostate and was buried three days later at Wolvercote cemetery.<br>

<a name="cosubject_51852"></a><span class="headword">Rachael Emily Poole</span>  (1860&#150;1937), <span class="occ">historian of portraiture</span>, was born on 13 June 1860 at 6 Marlborough Hill, St John's Wood, Marylebone, London, the second daughter of Frank Rodbard Malleson (1831&#150;1903), wine merchant and son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17887/', "John Philip Malleson")</script>. Her father and, especially, her mother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37733/', "Elizabeth Malleson, n&#233;e Whitehead (1828&#150;1916)")</script>, were active in the advancement of working-class, women's, and mixed education, and she met Reginald Lane Poole through the involvement of his uncle Reginald Stuart Poole in the same causes. Educated at home, she was a connoisseur of portraiture and music and a skilled administrator who gave much voluntary service to Oxford. Her <span class="italic">Catalogue of Oxford Portraits</span> (3 vols., 1912&#150;25), the product of twenty years' skilled research, is a work of permanent value. She was one of the founders of the Bach Choir in 1896. She was honorary treasurer of the Association for Promoting the Education of Women in Oxford (1892&#150;1901) and a member of its council (1901&#150;20); she also served on various university delegacies concerned with women students. In 1926 she was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, a rare honour for a woman at that time; the University of Oxford conferred the honorary degree of MA on her in 1932. She died on 9 April 1937 at home at 19 Banbury Road, Oxford, and was buried on 13 April in Wolvercote cemetery.<br>
