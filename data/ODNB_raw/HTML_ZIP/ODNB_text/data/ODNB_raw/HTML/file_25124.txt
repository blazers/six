<span class="headword">Seton,  John</span>  (1508/9&#150;1567), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and writer on logic</span>, is of unknown origins and parentage. Although his tombstone in Rome recorded that he died in 1567 at the age of seventy, he himself testified in 1551 that he was forty-two years of age. This accords better with the fact that he graduated BA from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1528. He was elected a fellow of the college on Bishop Fisher's foundation shortly afterwards and commenced MA in 1532. He gained a high reputation as a tutor. After ordination he became a chaplain to Bishop Fisher, attending him in the Tower. In 1542 he was one of the college fellows who signed an appeal to the visitor against John Taylor, the master of the college and afterwards bishop of Lincoln. In 1544 Seton proceeded DTh and about that time became a domestic chaplain to another conservative clergyman, Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, the master of Trinity Hall, and chancellor of the university, who rewarded him with the rectory of Hinton Ampner, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Under Edward VI, Seton's religious convictions brought him to greater prominence as the Catholic wing of the English church was increasingly threatened. In 1550 he attended Peter Martyr's disputation in Oxford, and the following year he testified at Gardiner's trial about the bishop's denial of papal authority and his acceptance of the royal supremacy. To illustrate this he recounted how Gardiner had ordered him to welcome two of the boy king's chaplains, the protestants Roger Tonge and Giles Ayer, as new canons of Winchester Cathedral. A dinner was held in their honour on 5 April 1548. Later that evening Seton, along with another of the bishop's chaplains, Thomas Watson, escorted the new canons to the inns where they were staying, &#145;and there made them good cheer&#146;. This was, so he deposed, the first time in four years that he had taken a drink in any of Winchester's public houses!<br>
<br>In return for his loyalty to Catholicism, Seton was presented by Queen Mary with a canonry of his own at Winchester in March 1554. On 14 April 1554 he incorporated DTh in Oxford after being sent by Gardiner, now lord chancellor, to take part in the disputation with Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer. He visited in prison the London radical priest John Bradford to try to persuade him to conform to the Marian church, and did the same, equally unsuccessfully, in 1558 with Thomas Benbridge. Seton suffered for his beliefs in the early years of Elizabeth's reign and he was deprived of his canonry in June 1559. His name was included in a 1561 list of &#145;papistical clergy&#146;: he was described as learned but settled in his papistry, and was ordered to go no further than 20 miles from London. After imprisonment and further persecution he fled to Rome. He was buried in the cemetery of the English College in Rome, where a memorial recorded that he died on 20 July 1567.<br>
<br>As a Catholic polemicist Seton wrote a panegyric to celebrate Mary's coronation in 1553, as well as contributing Latin verses to Alban Langdale's <span class="italic">Catholica confutatio Nic. Ridlei</span>, published in Paris in 1556. However, he was most famous as a logician. His <span class="italic">Dialectica</span> was first printed in 1545. Dedicated to Gardiner as chancellor of Cambridge, he claimed that his colleagues John Cheke and Thomas Watson persuaded him to publish what has been called &#145;virtually the last major document in the history of scholastic logic in England&#146;  (Howell, 50&#150;60). Nevertheless it remained the standard textbook for over a century, especially after the publication of an annotated edition in 1572, which was last reprinted in 1639. Such was its popularity among students that it was said to have circulated in manuscript before it was published. Even the Bodleian Library's printed copy of 1577 was shared among friends, being inscribed, &#145;Sum liber francisci Tred: et amicorum&#146; (&#145;I am the book of Francis Tred: and friends&#146;; Bodl. Oxf., 70 c. 79).<br>
