<span class="headword">Gordon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ogilvie]</span>, Dame  Maria Matilda</span>  (1864&#150;1939), <span class="occ">geologist and women's activist</span>, was born on 30 April 1864 in Monymusk, Aberdeenshire, elder daughter among seven children of Revd Alexander Ogilvie (1830/31&#150;1904), schoolmaster, and his wife, Maria Matilda Nicol. The family moved to Aberdeen in 1872 when Alexander Ogilvie became headmaster of Robert Gordon's Hospital (later College).<br>
<br>Following nine years at the Edinburgh Educational Institute for Girls (later the Edinburgh Ladies College which became, in 1944, the Mary Erskine School) and studies at the Royal Academy of Music, London, Ogilvie went to Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh. In 1889 she entered University College, London, and concentrated on geology, botany, and zoology (BSc, 1890, with gold medal in zoology and comparative anatomy). Continuing her studies at the University of Munich, as a private student of palaeontologist Karl von Zittel and zoologist Richard Hertwig, she specialized in recent and fossil corals. Her London DSc (1893) was the first in geology given to a woman and her PhD (1900, with distinction in geology, palaeontology, and zoology) was the first conferred on a woman by the University of Munich. In 1895 she married John Gordon, an Aberdeen physician. She had three children, but nevertheless continued her fieldwork.<br>
<br>All Maria Gordon's studies were done in the geologically very complex south Tyrol Dolomites, then a remote and isolated region. She published more than thirty original papers; especially notable was her early work on corals, and her theory of &#145;crust-torsion&#146; (1899) to explain the peculiar forms of the region's typical landscape features. Expanding on relatively new tectonic theories, she demonstrated that the steep-walled, circular or elliptical limestone massifs, initially considered to be unchanged coral reefs, resulted from complex crustal movements. Her comprehensive monograph <span class="italic">Das Gr&ouml;dener-, Fassa- und Enneberggebiet in den S&uuml;dtiroler Dolomiten</span> (1927) became the definitive reference for future work in the region; the portions dealing with tectonics and stratigraphy, illustrated with an outstanding collection of maps and sections, were the most notable, but the palaeontological discussions were also of considerable importance. <span class="italic">Geologisches Wanderbuch der Westlichen Dolomiten</span> followed in 1928. Her translation of von Zittel's work, published as <span class="italic">History of Geology and Palaeontology</span> (1901), was another major contribution. Slightly condensed at the author's request it appeared two years after the original German edition. These writings brought her wide professional recognition, first in Austria and Italy, then from the London Geological Society, from whom she received the Lyell medal in 1932.<br>
<br>Maria Gordon was active in several prominent national women's action groups. She presided over the meeting of the National Council of Women in 1914 which led to the establishment of women's patrols, and the 1917 meeting of the Women's Citizens Association which decided to make the body a national organization. Service in these action groups and the International Council of Women brought a DBE in 1935 and an LLD from Edinburgh University. After the death of her husband in 1919 she moved to London and became active in the Liberal Party and civic affairs. She was the first woman to chair a London borough court. Strong, sympathetic, and dedicated to this social service, she nevertheless felt acutely the resulting loss of scientific worktime, her days in the field being, she later recalled, the happiest of her life.<br>
<br>Probably the most productive woman field geologist of any country in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Maria Gordon was remembered as a penetrating observer, and as having a quick, intuitive grasp of her subject and tremendous enthusiasm. She died at her home, 32 Hanover Gate Mansions, Regent's Park, London, on 24 June 1939. After cremation at Golders Green on 28 June, her ashes were interred on the 29th at Allenvale cemetery, Aberdeen.<br>
