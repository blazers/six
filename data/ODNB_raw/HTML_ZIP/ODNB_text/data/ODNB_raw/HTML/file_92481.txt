<span class="headword">Iles,  Horace</span>  (1900&#150;1916), <span class="occ">boy soldier</span>, was born at 11 Cemetery Street, Leeds, Yorkshire, on 22 January 1900, the eldest of three sons of William Iles (1853&#150;1912), a journeyman joiner, and his wife, Elizabeth Heworth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beeton (1865/6&#150;1963). His father was a veteran of the British army, having served in the Second Afghan War under Lord Roberts. On his death in 1912 his wife was left to bring up Horace and his two younger brothers, Wilfred and Sidney. Horace also had a half-brother, Arthur Heworth, from his mother's previous marriage, and a half-sister, Florence (Florrie) Bews, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Iles, from his father's previous marriage. He attended St Mark's School, Woodhouse, Leeds, and was a choirboy in the Sunday school of Emmanuel Church, Woodhouse Lane. He left school aged thirteen to become an apprentice blacksmith's striker at a company called Pawson's near the family's home in the Woodhouse area of Leeds. He then tried his hand at painting and decorating for a different Leeds firm, Dennis &amp; Co. His physically demanding jobs as a young teenager help perhaps to explain why he was later believed by the recruiting officer when he claimed to be eighteen.<br>
<br>There is only anecdotal evidence for the family tradition, recounted in interviews by descendants of the Iles family, that he was given a white feather which encouraged him to volunteer for military service. What is known is that early in 1915, aged fifteen but having lied about his age, he joined the 15th (service) battalion (1st Leeds), the Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire regiment), better known as the Leeds Pals. After he completed training with the Pals at Colsterdale in north Yorkshire, his first destination was not France but Egypt, where the Pals stayed from December 1915 until 1 March 1916. They sailed for France, where they were billeted near Bus-les-Artois in the Somme region. Iles was wounded on 22 May 1916, and was hospitalized in France before being given seven days' home leave. This was the last time his family saw him. After returning to the front he was killed on 1 July 1916 along with other members of his battalion shortly after 7.30 a.m. on the first day of the battle of the Somme. The Leeds Pals were decimated in the offensive: thirteen officers and 209 other ranks were killed, and a further twenty-six died of wounds. Iles was buried in Serre Road cemetery no. 1, 11 kilometres north east of the town of Albert.<br>
<br>Like many young men of his generation Horace Iles is remembered for the manner of his death rather than for his short life. His story has had particular resonance in its continuing retellings owing to the survival of a poignant letter written to him by his half-sister, Florrie, on 9 July 1916, before news of his death had reached the family. Married with a small child of her own, Florrie was fifteen years older than Horace. She wrote to him from Leeds:<blockquote>You have no need to feel ashamed that you joined the Pals now, for by all accounts they have rendered a good account of themselves. No one can call them &#145;Feather bed soldiers&#146; now &hellip; We did hear that they were fetching all back from France under 19. For goodness sake Horace tell them how old you are. I am sure they will send you back if they know you are only 16. You have seen quite enough now just chuck it up and try to get back. You won't fare no worse for it. If you don't do it now you will come back in bits and we want the whole of you. (Van Emden, 240&#150;41)</blockquote>It was returned to her with the words &#145;Killed in Action&#146; written on the envelope.<br>
<br>In 2003 Iles's story was selected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to be used in an educational video, <span class="italic">One Boy</span>, and in 2014 he featured in a number of BBC broadcasts produced to commemorate the centenary of the First World War. His story has come to symbolize not only the heavy losses suffered by the British army in July 1916, but equally the estimated 250,000 underage soldiers who volunteered in 1914 and 1915.<br>
