<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sharington, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1553), <span class="occ">administrator and embezzler</span>, was the first son of Thomas Sharington (<i>d</i>. 1527?) of Norfolk and his wife, Katherine, daughter and heir of William Pyrton of Little Bentley, Essex. Despite the obscurity of his early years, it seems clear that two men were instrumental in his rise to importance: Sir Francis Bryan, diplomat and soldier, of whose affinity he was by 1538; and (also in Bryan's service) Sir Thomas Seymour, the younger brother of Protector Somerset. To the former Sharington was related by marriage by virtue of his taking as his first wife Ursula, the illegitimate daughter of John Bourchier, second Lord Berners, who was Bryan's brother-in-law; to the latter he became &#145;my friend&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/1, no. 43). By 1539 Sharington was page of the king's robes and in 1540 was appointed groom. In the following year he became page of the privy chamber and then, in 1542, when he also became joint steward and constable of Castle Rising, Norfolk, groom. As such, he had close personal access to Henry VIII and was ideally placed to gain further preferment. In 1546 he was made under-treasurer, or head, of the newly established mint in Bristol; in 1547 he was appointed to commissions to investigate the mints and the admiralty; and in the following year he became a chantry commissioner for Gloucester, Gloucestershire, and Bristol. The king is said to have trusted him, and so too must Queen Katherine Parr, who had welcomed him into her household by 1544. Sadly, as the investigations into the treasonous activities of Thomas Seymour subsequently revealed, this trust was entirely misplaced.<br>
<br>According to the act of attainder of 1549 by which Sir William Sharington (he had been knighted at the coronation of Edward VI in 1547) was condemned, he had been guilty of four offences: coining &pound;2000 in testoons, or shilling pieces, without warrant; coining a further &pound;10,000 in testoons, also without warrant; gaining over &pound;4000 profit by making his coins too light; and covering his tracks by compiling false records and burning the originals. Each was a serious charge but what gave them especial significance was that in rushing to Seymour, obviously with the intention of obtaining his protective support should his misdeeds be discovered, Sharington had succumbed to Seymour's plots. On being asked whether he could make &pound;10,000, sufficient to keep 10,000 men in the field for a month, Sharington had agreed that he could, provided bullion were available, and, moreover, he had said that so long as there was a mint in Bristol, Seymour &#145;should lack no money&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/6, no. 13). What had started out as simple fraud&#151;the result, according to his own confession, of his fear that his minting activities would leave him significantly out of pocket, but possibly also of his overspending on building activities at his principal seat of Lacock Abbey, Wiltshire, which he had purchased in 1540 for &pound;783&#151;had ended in disaster. Lacock and other properties, mostly in Wiltshire, which he had purchased for &pound;3800 were confiscated, as were 1937 ounces of plate and other goods including &pound;1000 in ingots and old gold, and gold and silver which it was estimated would have made up to &pound;14,000 in coin. However, having interceded for help with the earls of Shrewsbury and Southampton and with Somerset directly for mercy, his life was spared; the simple reason being that once Seymour had been executed Sir William was no political threat at all. On 5 November 1549 he was pardoned and subsequently restored to his estates on payment of &pound;12,867. In a sermon by Hugh Latimer preached before Edward VI in Lent 1549&#151;a sermon in which Seymour was castigated and through which it was said Latimer earned the &#145;great hatred of many&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 48023, fol. 351)&#151;Sharington was depicted as &#145;an honest gentleman, and one that God loveth &hellip; a chosen man of God, and one of his elected&#146;  (Latimer, 227).<br>
<br>Restored to lands and favour, Sharington was appointed in April 1550 with Sir Maurice Dennis, treasurer of Calais, to take receipt in France of 200,000 crowns, the first payment for the sale of Boulogne back to the French. He continued on the commission of the peace for Wiltshire, to which he had been appointed in 1547; in 1553 he became one of the commissioners in Wiltshire for the confiscation of church goods; and, on the ennoblement of Sir William Herbert in October 1551, he was returned at a by-election as an MP for Wiltshire, a position to which he had been elected in 1547 but from which he had been ejected upon his disgrace in 1549. Earlier on he had served as MP for Heytesbury (1545) and Bramber (1547). His appointment as sheriff of Wiltshire in 1552 effectively stymied his possible candidature for the parliament of 1553.<br>
<br>Over and above the rents that came from his lands and his salary of &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. at the mint, Sharington enjoyed an income from moneylending, which he appears to have practised on some scale, dealing with, among others, Sir William Herbert, Sir Miles Partridge, and Protector Somerset. Then there were his trading activities. In 1542, on Henry VIII's recommendation, he was made an honorary freeman of London and it was from there through his factor that he traded with Antwerp, importing in 1549, for example, &#145;Tapistry, Tiks and Lynnen Clothe for my Lorde Admirall [Thomas Seymour] hymself, and sum other of his Frends&#146;  (Haynes, 64), worth over &pound;2000. He also traded extensively in lead and English wool, owned ships, and ventured capital with Bristol merchants, on one occasion &#145;Southward&#146;, on another to &#145;Thisles of Portingale for Frute&#146;  (ibid., 65).<br>
<br>A man of culture, as evidenced by the Renaissance-style features of his building works at Lacock, Sharington survives through a drawing of him by Holbein, now at Windsor Castle. He married as his second wife Eleanor, daughter of William Walsingham, and in 1542, as his third wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Farrington, widow of Robert Paget, alderman of London, but left no children, and when he died, before 22 November 1553, he was succeeded by his brother Henry.<br>
