<span class="headword">Spencer,  Charles</span>, third duke of Marlborough  (1706&#150;1758), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was born on 22 November 1706, the third of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26117/', "Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland (1675&#150;1722)")</script>, a politician, and his second wife, Lady Anne Churchill (1683&#150;1716). As the grandson of the first duke, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5401/', "John Churchill")</script>, &#145;stat magni nominis umbra&#146; (&#145;he stands the shadow of a mighty name&#146;) would have been an appropriate motto. His path to the Sunderland peerage was blocked by an elder brother, Robert, and to the Marlborough peerage by a cousin, but the first died of fever in 1729 and the second, William Godolphin, marquess of Blandford, died in 1731 after a drinking spree at Oxford. In 1733 Spencer inherited the dukedom on the death of his aunt Henrietta (duchess in her own right), but since the redoubtable dowager duchess Sarah Churchill retained possession of Blenheim Palace during her lifetime, he was dependent upon her precarious favour.<br>
<br>After schooling at Hampstead and at Eton College Spencer made the conventional grand tour, and on his return adopted a lavish lifestyle, largely on expectations. His grandmother, the dowager duchess, intended to bring him into parliament for Woodstock in 1727 but was warned of a possible petition against him since he was still just under age: she substituted his cousin Lord Blandford, and Charles Spencer never served an apprenticeship in the Commons. He took his seat in the upper house as Lord Sunderland in January 1730. His close associates were the Fox brothers and their friend Lord Hervey, but his grandmother's hatred of Walpole took him into opposition. Although he was neither a ready debater nor a good speaker (his grandmother complained that he spoke through his teeth), his rank made him a valuable recruit and the glory of his grandfather's name lent him a vicarious authority in military matters. In his first session he voted for a place bill, a favourite nostrum of the opposition, and signed a protest, but his interest soon waned: he attended only five days in his first session and eight in 1731. His elevation to the dukedom raised his profile, and after taking his seat again in January 1734 his attendance increased considerably.<br>
<br>In February 1734, in the aftermath of the excise crisis, during which Walpole had secured the dismissal of several army officers who were opposition MPs, Marlborough was put up to move that the king should be deprived of the power to dismiss officers without recourse to parliament. Lord Hervey, an ally of Walpole, reported to Henry Fox that Marlborough had been &#145;extremely frightened, said but little, and what he did say was neither remarkably well or ill&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lord Hervey and his Friends</span>, 193). Condemned as an unwarrantable encroachment on the royal prerogative, his motion was defeated by 100 votes to 62. Marlborough continued in opposition and was a frequent visitor at the court of Frederick, prince of Wales. In 1737, when the prince had a spectacular quarrel with the king and was turned out of St James's Palace, Marlborough was reported at Carlton House with Chesterfield and Carteret distributing printed copies of the king's forthright message. But his financial position, as a result of gambling, fox-hunting, and building, was becoming desperate, and he had quarrelled violently with his grandmother, who complained that he was stolid and far from entertaining, and whose preference for his younger brother John was marked. A further cause of bad feeling had been his marriage, on 23 May 1732, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1761), the daughter and heir of Thomas Trevor, second Baron Trevor, and his wife, Elizabeth Burrell. She was a granddaughter of an erstwhile enemy of the great duke and one of the tory peers created in 1712 to carry the treaty of Utrecht. In March 1738 Marlborough abandoned opposition, signalling his adherence to Walpole by accepting the colonelcy of the 38th foot, and embarked, belatedly, on a military career. &#145;The Fox has stolen my goose&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 90), was his grandmother's tart comment. She retaliated by changing her will yet again to his disadvantage, and a series of legal actions followed, culminating in her appearance before Lord Hardwicke to declare that she would never trust Marlborough with his grandfather's diamond-studded sword, since he would only pick out the diamonds and pawn them.<br>
<br>Marlborough's political conversion brought quick rewards. Within six months he was made a lord of the bedchamber; he was appointed lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire in 1739 and given the Garter in 1741. He repaid Walpole by defending him against Carteret's motion of dismissal in February 1741, moving that to attempt &#145;to inflict any kind of Punishment, on any person without allowing him an opportunity of his Defence, or, without proof of crime, is contrary to natural justice, the fundamental laws of this realm, and the ancient, established usage of parliament&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 11, 1739&#150;41, 1218). His motion put the opposition into some disarray, and at length they decided to treat it as a truism, allowing it to pass unopposed. His attendance in parliament improved again, and in the critical session 1741&#150;2, which saw the fall of Walpole, he was present on thirty-four days. His connection with Henry Fox, who described him as &#145;the most intimate and dear friend from childhood&#146;  (Fox-Strangways, 2.106), and whose secret wedding he attended in 1744, brought him into the duke of Cumberland's orbit and improved his career chances. He was promoted brigadier-general in 1743 and fought with some distinction at Dettingen, but in the recriminations after the battle followed his commander-in-chief Lord Stair by resigning his bedchamber place and colonelcy in protest against the conduct of the Hanoverian troops. His motives, however, were mixed. A private reason was to avoid further separation from his wife, to whom he was devoted, explaining to her that he had forced &#145;a pretext to quit&#146; by demanding a promotion which the king emphatically refused  (Rowse, 49&#150;50). He signed a Lords protest against the Hanoverians in December 1743 and in January 1744 seconded Sandwich's motion, arguing that to employ Hanoverians in future would risk the allies turning their arms on each other in &#145;a scene of slaughter&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 13, 1743&#150;7, 566). Behaviour so pointedly offensive to the king is not easily explained. Horace Walpole thought he was still paying court to the dowager duchess. That scarcely explains Lord Stair's conduct. If true, Marlborough's grandmother was unimpressed, remarking that, like most recruits, her grandson had joined the army when drunk and left it when sober. The step would have ruined Marlborough's prospects, but in February 1744 reports of an imminent Jacobite invasion gave him the opportunity to move a loyal address and to join Stair in an audience with George II, when he pledged his life and fortune (of which there was little left) to the king. Stair was reappointed commander-in-chief, and Marlborough was reinstated and promoted major-general in 1745 and lieutenant-general in 1747. The reconciliation was complete when in 1746 Marlborough moved the Lords' congratulations on Cumberland's victory at Culloden.<br>
<br>The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 brought a change in Marlborough's career, following Henry Fox's political progress. In 1749 he was brought in by the Pelhams as lord steward of the household, a post he held until 1755, when he became a privy councillor. In 1750, 1752, and 1755 he was one of the lords justices who acted as regents during the king's absences in Hanover. This suggests that George II was at last getting over the detestation he had felt in the 1730s, when he seldom referred to Marlborough without some opprobrious epithet&#151;&#145;scoundrel, rascal or blackguard&#146;  (Hervey, <span class="italic">Some Materials</span>, 246). His electoral interests were not negligible. In 1754 he was a leader in seizing Oxfordshire for the whigs, and, though the coup could not be repeated, he retained one seat on a compromise. To his two seats at Woodstock, which gave little trouble after 1734, he added an interest in Oxford city and property at Heytesbury, and he also looked after the Spencer interest at St Albans during the minority of his nephew John from 1746 to 1755. In the political reshuffle after Pelham's death in 1754 he became lord privy seal, which post he retained from January to December 1755. When that office was needed for Lord Gower, Marlborough became master of the ordnance, which brought him into prominence at the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1756. The following year there was an unpleasant political skirmish, when he was sharply criticized for taking &pound;10 a day in pay and allowances and was obliged to repay the excess on &pound;4. The same year he was appointed with Lord George Sackville and General Waldegrave to investigate the fiasco of the attack upon Rochefort. Their report was highly critical of Sir John Mordaunt, who was subsequently court-martialled but acquitted. It was therefore understandable that Marlborough should be offered the command of a similar expedition against St Malo in 1758, with Sackville as his second in command but widely regarded as director of the enterprise. Despite a major effort involving eighteen ships of the line and 14,000 men, little was achieved, though a number of French ships and stores were burnt. The British withdrawal was so hasty that Marlborough left his silver spoons behind, which the French commander politely returned. As soon as the troops reached home Marlborough was appointed to command the army in Germany, again with Sackville as his immediate subordinate, to collaborate with Prince Ferdinand. Once more his strong dislike for the Hanoverians showed itself, and soon after arriving at Emden he threatened resignation rather than be outranked by the Hanoverian General Spoerchen: he was not prepared, he told Pitt, to be no more than &#145;cleavers of wood and drawers of water to the Hanoverians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 1.337&#150;8). Pitt hastily sorted out the problem, and Marlborough was gazetted &#145;general over all&#146; on 29 August  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 28, 1758, 379). He died in camp at Munster on 20 October 1758 and was buried at Blenheim in the chapel on 21 November.<br>
<br>Marlborough's death attracted attention for a bizarre reason. In November 1757 he had received an anonymous letter demanding money and threatening to destroy him without fear of discovery. Clearly poison was hinted at. More letters were received and meetings arranged, and in May 1758 William Barnard, the son of a respectable London merchant, was arrested and put on trial. After producing character witnesses and evidence that his financial affairs were by no means desperate, he was acquitted. Five months later the duke was dead. But the cause of death was almost certainly dysentery, and Calcraft reported to Henry Fox that Marlborough's lungs were so decayed that he could not have survived another year.<br>
<br>Contemporary references to Marlborough were often disparaging. We do not have to accept the dowager duchess's view of her &#145;ungrateful and very foolish grandson&#146;  (Yorke, 1.219), since admiration did not come easily to her. Lord Shelburne, just beginning his army career when Marlborough commanded in Germany, described him later as:<blockquote>an easy-going, good-natured, gallant man, who took a strange fancy for serving, to get rid of the ennui attending a private life, without any military experience or the common habits of a man of business, or indeed capacity for either, and no force of character whatever. (<span class="italic">Life</span>, ed. Fitzmaurice, 1.349)</blockquote>Horace Walpole thought him personally brave, but inexperienced&#151;&#145;capable of giving the most judicious advice and of following the worst &hellip; bashfulness and indistinctness in his articulation &hellip; confirmed a very mean opinion of his understanding&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.114; 3.24). Smollett was kinder: the duke was &#145;brave beyond all question, generous to profusion, and good-natured to excess&#146;  (Smollett, 3.8). The late start to his army career and his comparatively early death meant that Marlborough achieved supreme command only at the end of his life: though the St Malo campaign was hardly a success, no blame fell upon the duke, who was at once appointed to the German command.<br>
<br>Marlborough was succeeded by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26123/', "George Spencer (1739&#150;1817)")</script>, as fourth duke. His daughter Diana (1734&#150;1808) became known as an artist [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1848/', "Beauclerk, Lady Diana")</script>]. His younger sons, <a name="cosubject_26119"></a><span class="headword">Lord Charles Spencer</span>  (1740&#150;1820) and Lord Robert (1747&#150;1831), both had long political careers. The former, who was born on 31 March 1740 and educated at Eton (1747&#150;54) and Christ Church, Oxford (1756&#150;9), sat for Oxfordshire from 1761 to 1790 and again from 1796 to 1801. He held office as a lord of the Admiralty under Lord North, adhered to the Fox&#150;North coalition, and went over with Portland in 1794 to support Pitt. From 1801 until 1806 he was joint postmaster-general and from 1808 until his death a lord of the bedchamber. He married on 2 October 1762 Mary Beauclerk (<i>d</i>. 1812), the daughter and heir of Vere, first Baron Vere, and had two sons. His later life was a desperate effort to find and retain some office that would keep him financially afloat, and he was obliged to flee to the continent in 1818, at the age of seventy-eight, to escape his creditors. He died in Petersham, Surrey, on 16 June 1820.<br>
