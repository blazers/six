<span class="headword">Johnston,  John Harold <span class="st"> [Johnny]</span></span>  (1919&#150;1998), <span class="occ">songwriter and composer of advertising jingles</span>, was born on 10 July 1919 in Paddington, London. His parents' names were James and Florence, and his father was a policeman. Johnston's early life was spent in and around the Praed Street area, and he received his schooling in Star Street. A self-taught pianist, in his early teens he formed a musical trio playing at neighbourhood pubs, taverns, and clubs.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second World War interrupted this developing talent. Johnston joined the Essex regiment, ultimately achieving the rank of major. He was initially posted to Kenya where, playing the piano in out-of-bounds Nairobi nightclubs, he was so frequently run in by the military police that he decided to join them. He was mentioned in dispatches in September 1945. While in Kenya he met and married in 1945 Nona Reine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sapiro (<i>d</i>. 1975), a White Russian by birth, who was educated in France and was a woman of considerable style and elegance. She was soon to run his office and mastermind the books. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>After demobilization Johnston was ever present in that hallowed London street of popular music dreams and instant stardom, Denmark Street, plugging songs to give them exposure on such outlets as jaunty Radio Luxemburg. An instinctive and intuitive musician, he formed the Keynotes group in 1948, rapidly winning national recognition with the fondly remembered signature tune to <span class="italic">Take it from here</span>, which featured Jimmy Edwards, Dick Bentley, and June Whitfield. Other signature tunes for well-received BBC light music and humorous programmes followed and in the 1950s he ran a veritable stable of musical groups. To stimulate sales of sheet music and, later, recordings, to cinema organists and singers, with Mickey Michaels he formed in 1951 his own production company, Michael Reine Partners. His first hit song, &#145;The Homing Waltz&#146;, was recorded by Vera Lynn, followed by the equally simple, sentimental, and popular &#145;Parting Brings Sorrow&#146; and in 1953 by &#145;The Wedding of Lily Marlene&#146;, a sequel to the wartime international hit. Other national icons of the time, Alma Cogan and the Billy Cotton Band, also recorded his material. As a songwriter and arranger he worked for major stars Anne Shelton, Joy Nichols, and Dickie Valentine, and his backing groups the Johnston Singers and Johnston Brothers gave resonance to such runaway hit songs as &#145;Hernando's Hideaway&#146;, &#145;That Lucky Old Sun&#146;, and &#145;Tennessee Waltz&#146;, the last of which was, nearly half a century later, an enduring bitter-sweet memory for couples of a certain age. Hardly ever off the air, the Keynotes also made their first film appearance in a minor musical, <span class="italic">Melody in the Dark</span>. They were voted the country's top vocal group several times, but the advent of rock and roll killed off the group.<br>
<br>Johnston's imprint on 30 second snappy tunes was evident from the birth of television commercials on 22 September 1955, and as &#145;king of the jingles&#146; for the next thirty years he could claim 4500 memorable and hummable snatches of song that added potency to advertising. No advertising agency had experience of jingle composition and so, with his friend and rival Cliff Adams, Johnston was first to capitalize upon a brand new marketing tool. In his first year he composed, arranged, and produced accompaniments to advertisements for Kleenex tissues, Stork margarine, and New Zealand butter. One of his earliest compositions was for a &#145;time spot&#146;&#151;a 7 second advertisement&#151;that achieved a special kind of celebrity. Over a visual of a &#145;smiling mug&#146; were sung the words &#145;Sleep sweeter, Bournvita&#146;, followed by a yawn and the word &#145;goodnight&#146;. From Johnny Johnston Jingles Ltd came a cascade of classics. Singing to music from the <span class="italic">Nutcracker</span> suite, Frank Muir, for Cadbury's chocolate, made a memorable tribute to everyone's being a &#145;fruit and nut case&#146;; legions of housewives sang along with &#145;mild green Fairy Liquid&#146;, and Bing Crosby warbled &#145;You can be sure of Shell&#146;. Motorists, too, never tired of &#145;The Esso sign makes happy motoring&#146;, but perhaps his best ever was aimed at the kitchen millions who picked up a tin of beans and cried &#145;Beanz meanz Heinz&#146;.<br>
<br>Lauded within the commercial radio and television industry, Johnston made his home in Boxmoor, Hertfordshire, a venue for friends and glitterati. While he remained largely anonymous to the wider public whose lives he coloured and touched, his business expanded to Europe and South Africa, leading to a period of tax exile in Geneva. On the death of his wife Johnny settled in London where, effervescent to the end, he died at 27 Circus Road, Westminster, on 10 June 1998. Due tribute was paid to him in &#145;Jingles all the way&#146;, a BBC Radio 4 <span class="italic">Archive Hour</span> documentary first broadcast on 18 December 1999.<br>
