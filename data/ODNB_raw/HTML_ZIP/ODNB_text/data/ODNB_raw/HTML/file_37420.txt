<span class="headword">Fleming,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1822/3&#150;1883), <span class="occ">gardener</span>, was born in Scotland and first came to public notice in 1850. His early life and antecedents have not been traced: the earliest detail offered in his obituaries was his residence with a Mr Aiton of Bardsea, Ulverston, Lancashire, about 1844. From there he went to the garden of the earl of Denbigh at Newnham Paddox, Warwickshire, and thence in 1850 to Harewood, Yorkshire, where the grounds were then in the course of transformation by Sir Charles Barry, whom Fleming assisted in the creation of the terrace garden. From 1853 to 1855 he was gardener to the earl of Southampton at Whittlebury Lodge, Towcester.<br>
<br>From 1855 Fleming was head gardener at Cliveden, Buckinghamshire, initially to the second duke of Sutherland and then to H. L. Grosvenor, first duke of Westminster. At Cliveden he found himself working again with Barry, assisting him in the creation of a new terrace garden. By 1859 he could display the results of his experiments with the planting of bulbs in the parterre for a spring display. At this time there was much comment in the horticultural press about the excessive attention lavished on summer bedding at the expense of plants for the other seasons, and Fleming was the first gardener to become well known for &#145;spring gardening&#146;, though by the 1870s there was a coterie which pressed the claims to priority of William Ingram of Belvoir Castle. Fleming reported his experiments in the <span class="italic">Journal of Horticulture</span>, and published <span class="italic">Spring and Winter Flower Gardening</span> in 1864 (2nd edn, 1870).<br>
<br>In 1868, when a fashion for foliage came in, Fleming planted a bed of dwarf foliage plants and succulents, in the pattern of the countess of Sutherland's monogram. The <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, reviewing the experiment, coined the name &#145;carpet bedding&#146; for it, and recommended it for wider trial. Carpet bedding was to become a dominant fashion in England in the 1870s, and an international one in the 1880s. In 1870, with James Gray of Chelsea, Fleming erected new glasshouses at Cliveden, at the same time as he was engaged in landscaping a valley on the estate which was praised by William Robinson (1838&#150;1935) as a fine example of wild gardening  (<span class="italic">Garden</span>, 235).<br>
<br>From 1862 to 1864 Fleming served on the council of the Horticultural Society, and he was a member of the committee for the International Horticultural Exhibition of 1866. He died unmarried, of phthisis and abscess of the lungs, at Cliveden House on 26 November 1883, aged &#145;about 60&#146;  (d. cert.). The administration of his estate was granted to a Canadian relative.<br>
