<span class="headword">Griffin <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Grey]</span>,  Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Elizabeth Wallop, countess of Portsmouth]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1691, <em>d.</em> 1762), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was baptized on 30 November 1691 at Dingley, Northamptonshire, the eldest daughter of James Griffin (<i>bap</i>. 1667, <i>d</i>. 1715) and his wife, Anne (1667/8&#150;1707), the daughter of Richard Raynsford, of Dallington, Northamptonshire. The Griffin family had served the Stuart monarchs for several generations, and Elizabeth's grandfather, Edward Griffin, had been made a baron a few days before James II left England in 1688. James Griffin, who had been tory MP for Brackley in the 1685 parliament, succeeded as second Baron Griffin in 1710, but never assumed the title. Elizabeth's paternal grandmother was Lady Essex Howard, the eldest daughter and coheir of James Howard, third earl of Suffolk; through her the Griffins had a then disregarded claim to the Howard estates in Suffolk and Essex, centred on the mansion of Audley End.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Griffin's father, although a Roman Catholic, seems to have educated his children as members of the Church of England. On 14 May 1720 Elizabeth Griffin married Henry Grey (1683&#150;1740) at St Anne's, Soho. Grey was the second son of Richard Neville of Billingbear, Berkshire, and his wife, Catherine, the sister of Ford Grey, earl of Tankerville; the Grey and Neville families, unlike the Griffins, were whig and protestant supporters of the post-1688 revolution settlement. At the time of their marriage Grey was whig MP for Wallingford; he was later MP for Berwick upon Tweed from 1723 to 1727, and for Reading from 1734 until his death. They had no children. Grey's landed property in Northumberland and Berkshire was said to bring in an annual income of &pound;9700. Grey died on 9 September 1740, leaving Elizabeth his estate, including his country house at Billingbear, Berkshire, and a town house at 10 New Burlington Street, London. On 9 June 1741 Elizabeth married, as her second husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28582/', "John Wallop, first Viscount Lymington (1690&#150;1762)")</script>. Her marriage settlement ensured that she would retain control of her property, rather than its becoming that of her new husband. This marriage was also childless. Elizabeth became countess of Portsmouth when her husband was created an earl in 1743.<br>
<br>Lady Portsmouth's younger brother Edward, third Baron Griffin, died in 1742, leaving his estates and his claim to nominate the mastership of Magdalene College, Cambridge, to his illegitimate son Edward, who then sold the main Griffin residence of Dingley Hall. Lady Portsmouth and her sister Anne Whitwell were left as the legitimate representatives of the Griffin family, but without the family property. An opportunity for restoring the Griffin family fortunes arose in 1745 on the death of Henry Howard, tenth earl of Suffolk. Under a Howard family agreement of 1721 his main residence, Audley End, and the estates passed to a remote kinsman, Thomas Howard, second earl of Effingham. Lady Portsmouth challenged Effingham's right to Audley End in the courts; her solicitor found a draft of a deed of 1687 which showed the third earl of Suffolk had intended to leave the property to his daughter. In 1747 Lady Portsmouth and her sister Anne were adjudged to have inherited the estate of Saffron Walden, but the house and park remained with Effingham. However, Effingham had no clear plan for the dilapidated house and Lady Portsmouth bought Audley End in 1752 for &pound;10,000, having forced down Effingham's price by &pound;5000.<br>
<br>Lady Portsmouth found the contents of the house sold and parts of the building close to collapse. Sections of the once immense house (largely an early seventeenth-century creation, bought by Charles II in 1668 but subsequently returned by the crown to the Suffolks) had been demolished in the early eighteenth century. Lady Portsmouth was personally involved with all aspects of the reconstruction, which was always carried forward in her own name, not in that of her husband nor that of her nephew John Griffin Whitwell (1719&#150;1797), who changed his name to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11589/', "John Griffin Griffin")</script> in 1749 as a condition of his becoming Lady Portsmouth's heir. She evolved a carefully considered plan that balanced the conservation of the house's Jacobean appearance with mid-eighteenth-century taste. The crumbling east wing of the house, with its gallery measuring 226 feet, was demolished, and replaced by a colonnade which imitated Jacobean designs elsewhere in the building. Materials from the east wing were either sold or used for the repair of the remainder of the building. The house's great hall was saved and its stone fa&ccedil;ade was emphasized as the main face of the house, stressing Lady Portsmouth's descent from Thomas Howard, first earl of Suffolk, lord treasurer to James I. The seventeenth-century formal gardens were replaced with a less regulated parkland setting. The alterations left a building of Jacobean appearance that none the less conformed to the eighteenth-century fashion for country houses of a concentrated symmetrical design rather than a series of courts.<br>
<br>Lady Portsmouth's acquisition of Audley End had been motivated by the desire to exercise the patronage appropriate to her noble status as well as to regain a lost family home. Her research following the tenth earl of Suffolk's death had shown that the right the Griffins claimed to nominate the master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, was attached to the manor of Brooks Walden, where Audley End was built and which was retained by Lord Effingham in 1747. She purchased the right of nomination with the house in 1752, and in 1760, when the mastership fell vacant, she was assiduously courted by Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, who hoped to persuade her to appoint a government candidate. She rejected his attempts to influence her choice and appointed George Sandby, of whom Newcastle knew little, although he turned out to be a government supporter. Lady Portsmouth's right to appoint the master was never questioned, nor was she expected to defer to advice from men.<br>
<br>Lady Portsmouth&#151;described by William Cole as being &#145;as proud as Lucifer; no German princess could exceed her&#146;  (Jeffreys, 33)&#151;died on 13 August 1762, a few months before her second husband; she was buried near her first husband in the parish church of Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire. Her will confirmed the arrangement by which John Griffin Griffin would inherit Audley End. In addition, Billingbear was left to her husband's nephew Richard Neville Aldworth (1717&#150;1793) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19960/', "Neville, Richard Neville Aldworth")</script>], who was also named as Lady Portsmouth's residual legatee at Audley End should John Griffin Griffin die without a surviving son and heir. She made provision for her sister Anne Whitwell, her nieces Elizabeth and Mary Whitwell, and her cousin Jane James, which was specifically reserved for their own use and kept from the control of any husband. Codicils attempted to ensure that her successors in her estates would always bear the name of Griffin, and provided a legacy of &pound;5000 for her niece Mary provided that she married with the consent of John Griffin Griffin and Lord Portsmouth. Thus, although Lady Portsmouth had no children of her own and was happy to be known by the title of her Wallop husband, by nomination she established a hierarchy of male and female heirs who would perpetuate the Griffin name, maintain the estates she had assembled by inheritance, litigation, and purchase, and exercise the political power appropriate to their wealth and status.<br>
