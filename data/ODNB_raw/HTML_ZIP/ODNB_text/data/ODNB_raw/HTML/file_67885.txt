<span class="headword">Crace family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1725&#150;<em>c.</em>1900), <span class="occ">interior decorators</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_60734"></a><span class="headword">Edward Crace</span>  (1725&#150;1799)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at 40 Rochester Row, London, the son of Thomas Crace (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;1774), a coach-maker of yeoman descent who was trading from 40 Rochester Row by 1724, and his wife, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 14 Sept 1690), whom he had married in 1718. Mary was the daughter of Henry Gregory (1660&#150;1725), surveyor to the fabric of Westminster Abbey, whose brother, John Gregory (<i>b</i>. 1655), was college carpenter. Edward Crace was apprenticed to William Atkinson, an artist in the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, in 1741. His two brothers, John [i] Crace (1728&#150;1806) and Charles Crace (1727&#150;1784), worked with him in the family business, although John [i] later owned a print shop in Drury Lane. Drawings in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York attest to the facility with which Edward and Charles designed coach panels and ornament in the then-fashionable rococo style. On 13 October 1748 Edward Crace was given the freedom of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, and on 4 October 1752 he was admitted to the livery. Charles Crace published a book of designs for coach bodies in 1750, a copy of which survives in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Edward Crace married in 1753 Anne (<i>c</i>.1733&#150;1764), the daughter of an artist, James Munn of Greenwich. Of their three children, it was their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_60733"></a><span class="headword">John [ii] Crace</span>  (1753&#150;1819)<span class="occ"></span>, who eventually became head of the family decorating business. With his second wife, Martha (<i>c</i>.1740&#150;1770), the daughter of William Bent, whom he married in 1765, Edward had another son who died aged twenty-five in 1791. They lived at 40 Long Acre, Covent Garden, London.<br>
<br>In 1768 Edward Crace made the transition from coach decorating to house decorating, establishing a business that was to continue until 1899, when it was dissolved by his great-great-grandson. Crace's first, and ultimately most important, commission was for the decoration and furnishing of the Pantheon on Oxford Road, London, begun in 1770 (dem.). It was likewise the first important commission for the architect, James Wyatt, who created a landmark in neo-classical architecture. Crace responded with painted arabesques and cameo decoration which Horace Walpole likened to the work of Raphael.<br>
<br>George III was equally impressed by the scholarly quality of the scheme, and at some time in the 1770s he engaged Edward Crace, reputedly of a quiet and studious disposition, to be keeper of the collection of paintings in the various royal residences. This occupied Crace until his retirement in the 1790s. An undated manuscript catalogue by Crace for the pictures at Queen's House (now Buckingham Palace) and his published catalogue of the pictures at Kensington Palace, dated 1778, are in the Archive of Art and Design at the Victoria and Albert Museum. As well as cataloguing, Edward Crace's duties included cleaning, restoring, and varnishing the paintings of the Royal Collection. Towards the end of his life Crace became infirm and devoted much time to collecting prints and drawings. This collection was a source of delight to his grandson Frederick [i] Crace [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6556/', "Crace, Frederick (1779&#150;1859)")</script>] when the latter came to visit and may have inspired his Crace Collection, now in the British Museum (print room) and British Library (map room) and the Guildhall Library, London. Edward Crace died on 7 December 1799 and was buried in Chiswick.<br>
<br>John [ii] Crace was born on 1 November 1754 at Greenwich. He was apprenticed to his father on 26 November 1767, but owing to his elopement with his second cousin, Ann (1758&#150;1778), the daughter of Edward Eastham of Long Acre, whom he married in January 1776, there was a complete break between father and eldest son for several years, and John [ii] Crace began his own decorating business in 1776. According to family tradition, Ann Eastham was an heiress, being the granddaughter of John Gregory (1694&#150;1758), a wealthy builder and decorator of Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, and the son of Henry Gregory, surveyor to Westminster Abbey. However, she died on 12 May 1778, five days after the birth of their second child, and by the end of October that year, John [ii] Crace, now settled at 55 Great Queen Street, had married Catherine (1754&#150;1809), the daughter of John Wigzell of Greenwich. The couple went on to have seven children, and their three sons all worked in the family decorating business, as did Catherine herself. On 2 March 1785 John [ii] Crace received the freedom of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, and on 3 June 1789 he was admitted to the livery. A handful of bills dating from 1780 to 1804 (Archive of Art and Design, V&amp;A) demonstrates the fairly routine house decorating sometimes carried out by John Crace.<br>
<br>By 1801 John [ii] Crace had joined the circle of Sir John Soane in his capacity as painter to the board of works. He worked in conjunction with John Robins, an upholder (or interior decorator and upholsterer) and auctioneer, collaborating on a number of decorating and furnishing commissions, including 12 Lincoln's Inn Fields (<i>c</i>.1794), Pitzhanger Manor, Ealing (<i>c</i>.1802)&#151;Soane's town and country houses&#151;as well as at the Bank of England (1794). The major commissions of Crace's career, however, came from the future prince regent. These were at Carlton House (<i>c</i>.1785&#150;1795) and the Royal Pavilion, Brighton (<i>c</i>.1801&#150;1804), both in conjunction with his talented eldest son, Frederick [i] Crace, who acted as principal designer. The former was decorated in a sumptuous brand of neo-classicism inspired by French sources, while the latter was decorated in a bold scheme of chinoiserie, mostly superseded by the later chinoiserie decoration of Frederick [i] (1815&#150;<i>c</i>.1825). John [ii] Crace died at his home in Knightsbridge on 9 May 1819, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. He left a considerable collection of Chinese <i>objets d'art</i> and topographical books on China, some of which were passed on to Frederick [i], and which must have inspired the father and son in their work at Brighton.<br>
<br>To continue the family decorating business, a partnership was formed in 1806 between the brothers Frederick [i] Crace, Alfred Crace (1781&#150;1847), and Henry Crace (<i>b</i>. 1790). They were assisted by a cousin, John [iii] Crace, the son of John [i] Crace, the coach-maker-turned-print dealer. (The younger John worked for the Crace decorating business during his entire career, eventually moving with Frederick [i] Crace to 14 Wigmore Street in 1827.) The partnership began trading at 34 Curzon Street, moving to 51 Great Queen Street in 1812, later also trading from 230 Regent Street, before being dissolved owing to financial disputes particularly involving Alfred Crace. In 1830 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50537/', "John Gregory Crace (1809&#150;1889)")</script> had been sent to Rouen by his father, Frederick [i], to settle the debts Alfred had incurred. After the death of his first wife, Sarah Trery, in 1836, Alfred emigrated to Upper Canada. About this time he married his second wife, Ellen Nash, and assumed the surname Crace-Calvert. He died in Canada in 1847, leaving five children. The Crace decorating business reached its apex during the second half of the nineteenth century under the able direction of John Gregory Crace, assisted by his artistically gifted eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51463/', "John Dibblee Crace (1838&#150;1919)")</script>, who closed the business in 1899 but continued to work as a consultant until the First World War.<br>
<br>Moreover, various Crace family members had distinguished themselves in the textile and timber trades during the second half of the nineteenth century. Dr Frederick Crace-Calvert, the son of Alfred Crace, published a definitive book on calico dyeing in Manchester in 1876, while Everard Crace, the son of John Gregory Crace, was apprenticed to a silk weaver in Lyons and wrote a manuscript (<i>c</i>.1875) on the subject that is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Another relation, Charles Napoleon Crace, descended from John [i] Crace, was a leading London timber merchant during this period. There can be no doubt that the international fame and reputation garnered by the Craces, and their successful undertaking of large and complex schemes of architectural decoration for some of the most important buildings of their day, were possible owing to the remarkable legacy of professional expertise in the building and decorating trades that had been continuously developed by family members since the seventeenth century.<br>
