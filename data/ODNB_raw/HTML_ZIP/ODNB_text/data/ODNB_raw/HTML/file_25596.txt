<span class="headword">Simpson,  William</span>  (1627?&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, was from Sunbricke or Sunbreak in Lancashire, where he &#145;also received the truth&#146;, being convinced of the Quaker message there  (Tomkins, 185). Little is known of his early years and background, except that he came of humble origins and was a husbandman. He may have been the William Simpson baptized on 13 June 1627 in the priory church, Cartmel, Lancashire, the son of Thomas Simpson and Ann Ellithorne. He was married to Ann Symson, who died on 6 December 1669 and was buried at Sunbreak. It is likely that Christopher Simpson of Sunbreak, who married Isabel Birkett in 1675, was their son as his father was William.<br>
<br>Simpson preached in the north at Pardshaw in Cumberland, and along with Thomas Laiton was the first to spread Quakerism in Mitton under Wychwood. He travelled widely and in 1655 is listed as receiving money from the Kendal fund to travel to Scotland and spread the Quaker message.<br>
<br>Simpson is particularly noted for testifying by signs, a practice which was adopted by some followers of the early Quaker movement but gradually died out in the seventeenth century. George Fox, in a testimony to Simpson, noted how Simpson<blockquote>went three years naked and in sackcloth, in the days of Oliver and his parliament, as a sign to them, and to the priests, showing how God would strip them of their power, and that they should be as naked as he was.</blockquote>Fox also added how Simpson &#145;was made oftentimes to colour his face black&#146; as a sign of the spiritual darkness of ministers  (Fortescue, 13). Simpson went naked in a number of towns and cities, including Colchester, Cambridge, London, and Oxford. In the latter, accompanied by two other Friends who carried his clothes, he passed from the east gate to the middle of the city, where he was whipped, and then continued through to the north gate, where he met with some scholars. Of interest is Simpson's broadside entitled <span class="italic">Going Naked a Sign</span> (1660), in which he describes the practice and how he felt moved to testify in this manner. In it he recounts how<blockquote>a necessity was laid upon me from the Lord God &hellip; to be a sign: but before I was given up to the thing, it was as death unto me, and I had rather, if it had been the Lord's will, have died than gone on in this service.</blockquote>He was imprisoned with others at Oxford in 1654 for bearing a public testimony against vice and superstition, and in 1655 suffered further incarceration for preaching at Banbury.<br>
<br>Simpson also encountered opposition elsewhere. He was sent out of Evesham in 1657 for telling the inhabitants &#145;to repent and fear the Lord&#146;  (Besse, 2.60). In April of the same year he was arrested at Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire and sent to Lancaster, charged with being a wandering person. Later, in 1659 he was whipped upon his back and breast for going naked through Evesham &#145;in a prophetic manner&#146;  (ibid., 61), and in the same year went naked at Halsted in Essex, where he was badly beaten by a man named John Folks who, according to Besse, died shortly afterwards. In an entry for 1661, but no doubt referring to an earlier date, George Fox noted in his <span class="italic">Journal</span> how Simpson went naked in Cambridge but was protected by the mayor, who &#145;did nobly to him; he put his gown about him and took him into his house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, ed. Nickalls, 408).<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Simpson suffered considerably in the Quaker cause but appears to have stopped prophesying by signs around this time. In 1663 he was sent to prison with others for refusing the oath of allegiance after his removal from a meeting at Bugbrook, in Northamptonshire. The next year, according to Fox's <span class="italic">Journal</span>, he was fined for not attending church. In 1670 he was removed for preaching from Westminster and Devonshire House meetings, and suffered a fine of 20<i>s</i>. for preaching in the street at Ratcliffe after the meeting-house had been barricaded.<br>
<br>On 8 July 1670 Simpson travelled to Barbados to spread the Quaker message with John Burnyeat, who described his close friend as &#145;a very innocent man, and full of fear and reverence &hellip; very sweet and pleasant&#146;, and went on to say how they &#145;walked in great love and unity together; for he was a humble man, and had very low thoughts of himself&#146;  (Burnyeat, 39).<br>
<br>Simpson's literary output was very small, but of importance for shedding light on early Quaker practices. In <span class="italic">From one who was Moved of the Lord to Go a Sign</span> (1659) Simpson wrote with apocalyptic urgency,<blockquote>so signs in your streets also must you have, that you may be left without excuse in the day when the Lord will come to reckon with you, that you shall not say you have not been warned, so your blood shall be upon your head if you repent not. (p. 6)</blockquote>His other writings were generally warnings and reproofs such as <span class="italic">A Discovery of the Priest and Professors</span> (1660). In <span class="italic">A Declaration unto All, both Priests and People</span> (1655) Simpson criticized ministers for taking tithes from their congregations and for denying &#145;immediate revelation&#146; which he said he &#145;and all the saints have&#146;, and for denying &#145;perfection to be obtained while &hellip; in this body of clay&#146;  (pp. 3&#150;4).<br>
<br>Not long in Barbados, Simpson was taken ill with &#145;a violent fever&#146;, from which he died on 8 February 1671  (Burnyeat, 39). He is said to have &#145;departed this life like a lamb&#146;, a leaving which it was hoped would &#145;give content&#146; to his son  (Fortescue, 7). He was buried in the garden of Richard Forstal of Bridge-Town, Barbados.<br>
