<span class="headword">Whitrowe,  Joan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1631&#150;1707), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was the wife of Robert Whitrowe (<i>d</i>. in or before 1688), a tailor, and the mother of <a name="cosubject_69347"></a><span class="headword">Susannah Whitrowe</span>  (<em>c.</em>1662&#150;1677)<span class="occ"></span> and Jason Whitrowe (<i>c</i>.1671&#150;1677). Nothing certain is known about her parents, childhood, or education. She may be the Joan Robinson who married Robert Whitrow at St Clement Danes, Westminster, on 17 January 1657; if so she may have been the daughter of Morgan and Ellin Robinson who baptized their child at St Botolph without Aldgate in February 1630. In a work of 1692 she cited Marcus Aurelius on the virtues of retirement, suggesting that she had a degree of familiarity with classical texts. She was called to prophesy in Bristol and London shortly before the plague arrived in London in 1665. She presented herself as a sign of repentance, by fasting, wearing sackcloth, and giving aid and counsel to plague victims. She was initially allied with the Quakers, but she later broke with them and declared that she was not a member of any sect or &#145;gathered People&#146;  (<span class="italic">Humble Address</span>, 1689, 13). Neither her name nor that of her daughter appears in a manuscript list of Quakers active in the period held by the Friends' Historical Library in London.<br>
<br>In the 1670s, Whitrowe and her family were living in Covent Garden, London, and it was there in 1677 that both Jason and Susannah died. Jason, aged about six and a half, had been a student at the Latin school and had announced shortly before his death that he would preach a sermon in a tavern against pride and drunkenness. However, it was the death of Susannah, aged about fifteen, that prompted Whitrowe to write what became her most widely read work, <span class="italic">The work of God in a dying maid, being a short account of the dealings of the Lord with one Susanna Whitrow</span> (1677). This biography detailed Susannah's utterances against corruption, her initial but mistaken aversion to the Quakers because they were generally socially despised and allowed women to preach, her praise of her mother's spiritual integrity, and her desire to be buried alongside Quakers rather than near a church. In particular, it provides eyewitness accounts of her final illness as she fought &#145;the tempter&#146;, with her mother and the prominent Quaker minister Rebecca Travers at her bedside; after four days of spiritual struggle, she began a period of ecstasy and continuous prayer in anticipation of her own death, which came several days later  (Mack, 394). Her final words were &#145;I am ready, I am ready&#146;  (Mack, 395). <span class="italic">The Work of God</span> went through a number of not always wholly accurate editions through to the 1690s.<br>
<br>Whitrowe blamed her husband's evil life for the deaths of her children&#151;she had, according to Susannah, repeatedly rebuked Robert for offences against God&#151;but she interpreted their deaths as both an offering to God and a commission to forsake domestic life for that of a prophet. From 1682 she wore sackcloth until the death of Charles II. Robert Whitrow's will  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/390/413), which was proved on 31 March 1688, made no mention of his wife. In the 1690s Joan Whitrowe was living in Putney, Surrey. Between 1689 and 1697 she wrote a number of prophetic tracts addressed to King William as well as works directed to Queen Mary and to Christians in general. In these publications she recounted her visionary experiences, several of which described a heavenly woman travailing in childbirth, and the transformation of Whitrowe's body and spirit into a state of angelic perfection and mystical union with God. The tracts also contained warnings to king and people to repent in preparation for God's impending judgment. Whitrowe criticized the king's predilection for hunting at a time when the people, corrupted by covetousness, were wallowing in the sins of swearing, drunkenness, and idolatry. She also insisted that her readers repudiate their own personal ambitions and attainments, particularly their obsession with fashion, and renew their dedication to piety, humility, and obedience to God and king.<br>
<br>Whitrowe's writings&#151;which she was adamant that she wrote herself and not with the help of &#145;some Man&#146; as some had suggested  (<span class="italic">Widow Whiterows Humble Thanksgiving</span>, 1694)&#151;are of historical importance as striking examples of the mystical visionary literature that circulated in the period after the Restoration, and may be said to have culminated in the activities of the Philadelphians during the 1690s and the arrival of the French prophets who were active in London in the early eighteenth century. However, Whitrowe's prophetic writings were more politically assertive than those of other late seventeenth-century prophets, and in her criticism of social and economic injustice she resembles the early Quakers more than the mystical Philadelphians. Thus she criticized cultural and class hierarchies that oppressed the truly humble:<blockquote>the Superior by his Craft and Subtilty gets the Estate of the Inferior to himself, by his Oppression and Extortion, and so constraineth the poor silly Souls to labour hard, to maintain the Pride and Luxury of the Rich &hellip; when, at the same time, the Rich Man's Dogs fares [<i>sic</i>] better than the Needy Soul, and all this must be counted Equal, Just, and Right. (<span class="italic">Faithful Warnings</span>, 1697, preface)</blockquote>Whitrowe's works are also interesting as an example of a woman's perception of sacred literature and its relation to her own experience, both as a mother and as prophet &#145;giving birth&#146; to divine messages: &#145;I cannot compare [giving myself up to God] with any thing in this World, but a Woman in the strongest Travail and greatest Pain, that ever was known, to bring forth a Child into the World&#146;  (<span class="italic">Faithfull Warnings</span>, 79).<br>
<br>Whitrowe's last known work was an untitled seven-page condemnation of the Quaker leadership, which was privately printed for the author in May 1701. The text bears the printed signature &#145;J. Whitrow&#146; and a manuscript ascription &#145;Joan Whitrow&#146; in what appears to be the hand of the Quaker apostate Francis Bugg. The author attacks those Quakers who live extravagantly at a time when others live in extreme poverty. The work, now in Lambeth Palace library, came from Sion College library and was bound among pamphlets that seem to have once been in Bugg's collection.<br>
<br>Towards the end of her life Whitrowe moved to Twickenham, Middlesex, where she became acquainted with Matthew (Mathias) Perkins (<i>c</i>.1665&#150;1741), dissenter and barber-surgeon, whom she made executor of her will. Joan Whitrowe died aged &#145;about 76 Years&#146; at Twickenham on 8 September 1707 and her funeral was held at St Mary's Church on 20 September  (<span class="italic">The Censor</span>, no. 27, 10 June 1715). She was buried in Perkins's garden, on London Road, Twickenham, and the site was marked by an elaborate monument situated within the garden wall. In a letter to the duchess of Hamilton, in October 1717, Alexander Pope commented on the &#145;Epitaph on Twitnam High-way&#146;, which was later demolished  (Pope, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.437&#150;8).<br>
