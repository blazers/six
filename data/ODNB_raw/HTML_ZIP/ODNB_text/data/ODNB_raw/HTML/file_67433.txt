</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kendrew, Sir  John Cowdery</span>  (1917&#150;1997), <span class="occ">molecular biologist</span>, was born on 24 March 1917 in Oxford, the only son of Wilfrid George Kendrew (1884&#150;1962), reader in climatology at the University of Oxford, and his wife, Evelyn May Graham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sandberg (<i>d</i>. 1961), art historian, for many years resident in Florence, where she published under the name of Evelyn Sandberg-Vaval&agrave;; Kendrew was brought up by his father. Kendrew was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford (1923&#150;30), and at Clifton College, Bristol (1930&#150;36), where he became interested in chemistry. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a major entrance scholar, reading chemistry, physics, biochemistry, and advanced mathematics (the latter two as half subjects) for the first part of the natural sciences tripos, and chemistry for the second. In 1938 he was awarded a senior scholarship at Trinity and in 1939 graduated with first-class honours. He then started doctoral research in the department of physical chemistry under E. A. Moelwyn-Hughes.<h2>
<a name="Warservice"></a>War service</h2>Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Kendrew was told to continue his research, but with most of his colleagues leaving for war-related projects he became increasingly dissatisfied and searched for possibilities actively to join the war effort. In February 1940 he was recruited to the Air Ministry Research Establishment (later the Telecommunication Research Establishment) to work on the development of airborne radar. In September 1940 he was attached to the staff of Sir Robert Watson-Watt for operational research duties, a field then in its infancy. From Royal Air Force Coastal Command (1940&#150;41) he moved to Cairo to build up the operational research section at headquarters RAF Middle East (1941&#150;4), and from there to air command south-east Asia, where he served in India and Ceylon as officer in charge of operational research and as scientific adviser to the allied air commander-in-chief (1944&#150;5). He worked mainly on anti-submarine warfare, bombing accuracy, and radio aids. While at Cairo he produced the very successful <span class="italic">Handbook for Aircrews and Controllers</span>, often referred to by aircrews as the &#145;bible&#146;. On his move to south-east Asia he was appointed honorary wing commander. He rejoined the Air Ministry in London in June 1945 after a four-month return trip via Australia, the south-west Pacific, and the USA, which he visited on military mission.<br>
<br>When the war ended Kendrew contemplated a career in the scientific civil service. With others he was convinced that science had an important role to play in post-war reconstruction, and felt that scientists who like him had gained experience of administration and of working alongside government had the moral obligation to remain in government service. However, after some hesitation, he decided to return to academia until career chances in the civil service were more clearly defined.<h2>
<a name="Proteincrystallography"></a>Protein crystallography</h2>In September 1945, having been awarded an ICI research fellowship, Kendrew started research in protein crystallography in the Cavendish Laboratory, under the guidance of Max Perutz and with W. H. Taylor, reader in crystallography, as official supervisor. This represented a clear break from his pre-war research. According to Kendrew's own account it was the crystallographer John Desmond Bernal who, &#145;in a jungle in Ceylon&#146; while both he and Kendrew were working as advisers to the allied air commander-in-chief, convinced Kendrew that it should be possible to use X-ray diffraction to solve the structure of proteins  (video interview with J. Kendrew, 18 June 1997, Laboratory of Molecular Biology Archive). Kendrew also credited the structural chemist Linus Pauling and the embryologist Conrad Waddington, both of whom he had met during the war, with influencing him in his decision to move from chemistry to biology. However, the techniques he employed required a broad range of physical, chemical, mathematical, and organizational skills, for which he was well suited both by education and by talent. He made good use of those skills, thereby making decisive contributions to the new field of protein crystallography.<br>
<br>Kendrew first collaborated with Perutz in the investigation of the structure of haemoglobin, embarking on a comparison of foetal and adult haemoglobin. This work gained him his PhD in 1949. From the beginning, however, he also attempted the crystal analysis of myoglobin, the protein responsible for oxygen storage in muscle. This project was long hampered by the difficulty of growing crystals of a size suitable for X-ray analysis. Once this hurdle was cleared and sperm whale myoglobin identified as ideal source material the project was much aided by the small size of myoglobin (a quarter that of haemoglobin). By this time protein crystallography in the Cavendish under the aegis of W. Lawrence Bragg was put on a more secure footing by the creation, in 1947, of the Medical Research Council unit for the molecular structure of biological systems, with Perutz and Kendrew as only members. Other scientists as well as assistant staff soon joined, among them Hugh Huxley, Kendrew's first PhD student; Francis Crick; James Watson, originally taken on to help Kendrew with his myoglobin project; Vernon Ingram; and Sydney Brenner.<br>
<br>In 1957 Kendrew and his collaborators presented a first molecular model of myoglobin at 6 &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m resolution. The model, the first of a globular protein ever to be built based on direct structure analysis, was remarkable for the unexpected twists the protein chain performed. It was followed two years later by a 2 &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m resolution model, built of meccano and &#145;Kendrew type&#146; skeletal model parts, which indicated the exact position of most of the 1200 atoms of the molecule. This work gained Kendrew, jointly with Perutz, the 1962 Nobel prize for chemistry. The crystallographic calculation for both models relied decisively on the use of the first electronic digital computers built at Cambridge, EDSAC I and II, of which Kendrew made pioneering use. Together with John Bennett of the mathematical laboratory in Cambridge he wrote the first paper on crystallographic computation with electronic digital computers, published in <span class="italic">Acta crystallographica</span> in 1952. His interest in electronic computers built on his long-standing fascination with information handling systems. This pronounced interest, together with his organizational skills, were crucial for the successful completion of the myoglobin project. In her informed guide to Kendrew's extensive collection of papers, Jeannine Alton observed how an interest in note keeping, filing, and organization, present in the schoolboy and fostered by operational research during the war, found a kind of &#145;bureaucratic apotheosis in the sustained effort of accuracy required for the long haul to the final successful three-dimensional picture [of the protein molecule]&#146;  (Alton, 65).<br>
<br>Kendrew was an active fellow of Peterhouse, where he was first a research fellow (1947&#150;53), then a supernumerary fellow (1953&#150;75), and finally an honorary fellow (1975&#150;97); from 1972 he was also an honorary fellow of Trinity. He was director of studies in natural science for many years and also undertook other college duties, serving successively as librarian, prolector, steward, wine steward, and custodian of the college's paintings. Also from Peterhouse, Kendrew for many years edited the <span class="italic">Journal of Molecular Biology</span>, founded by him on the initiative of Kurt Jacobi in 1959. The journal contributed decisively to the establishment of molecular biology as a distinctive field of research. Kendrew remained editor-in-chief of the journal until 1987. In 1964 he presented the new biology in a BBC lecture series, later published as a book, <span class="italic">The Thread of Life</span> (1966). On 1 May 1948 he married Mary Elizabeth Jarvie (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), a widow, and daughter of John Henry Gorvin, civil servant; shortly thereafter she qualified as a medical practitioner. There were no children of the marriage, which was dissolved in 1956.<br>
<br>When Bragg moved to the Royal Institution in 1954 Kendrew became a part-time reader at the Davy&#150;Faraday Laboratory to help build up protein crystallography there, a post he held until 1968. When in 1962 the MRC unit moved from the Cavendish to the new MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge, he became deputy chairman of the new institution and head of its structural studies division. He continued to work on the refinement of the myoglobin structure, pushing the analysis to 1.4 &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m resolution. However, this work was never published. While continuing to run his division effectively his own interest in active research began to wane. Instead he took on an increasing number of advisory and organizational functions relating both to military and to civil research.<h2>
<a name="Widerfields"></a>Wider fields</h2>In 1961, on the suggestion of Solly Zuckerman, chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence, who had crossed paths with Kendrew in Cairo during the war, he was appointed part-time scientific adviser to the same ministry. He resigned the position in 1963, but continued to serve as an independent member on numerous defence panels and committees. From 1971 to 1974 he was chairman of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council. Parallel to his military advisory functions he was also involved in civilian science policy. He was a member of the Council for Scientific Policy from its inception under the Labour government in 1964 to its demise in 1972. He served as deputy chairman from 1969. He was also chairman of the standing committee on international scientific relations and chairman or member of many of the council's working groups, notably one on molecular biology.<br>
<br>In December 1962 Kendrew became involved in the first informal discussions regarding the creation of a European molecular biology laboratory on the model of Conseil Europ&eacute;en de Recherches Nucl&eacute;aires, a plan which he embraced wholeheartedly. The successful conclusions of the negotiations, which stretched over more than a decade, owed much to Kendrew's perseverance and diplomatic skills. He was a founder member of the European Molecular Biology Organization; he served on its council (1963&#150;71 and 1975&#150;7) and as its secretary-general (1969&#150;74). He was also secretary-general of the European Molecular Biology Conference, the intergovernmental organization for the support of molecular biology (1970&#150;74). He headed the laboratory committee from its inception in 1969, became project leader in 1971, and in 1975 moved to Heidelberg as first director-general of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Kendrew's mediation was particularly decisive for the inclusion of Israel, which contributed with a generous gift to the launch of the plan.<br>
<br>On his retirement from Heidelberg in 1982 Kendrew became president of St John's College, Oxford, a post which he filled for five years with his usual dedication and effectiveness. In 1987 he returned to his residence at the Old Guildhall, Linton, near Cambridge.<br>
<br>Among the innumerable other offices he held Kendrew gave particular importance to his long association with the International Council of Scientific Unions, which he served as secretary-general (1974&#150;80), vice-president (1982&#150;3), president (1983&#150;8), and past president (1988&#150;90). He was also a member of the board of governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science (1963&#150;97); a member of the BBC Science Consultative Group (1964&#150;7); president of the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (1969&#150;72); president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1973&#150;4); trustee of the British Museum (1974&#150;9); trustee of the International Foundation for Science (1975&#150;8); chairman of the natural sciences advisory board of the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO (1976&#150;84); a member of the council, UN University (1980&#150;86; chairman 1983&#150;5); and chairman of the board of governors of the Joint Research Centre, EEC (1985&#150;92). Among the later responsibilities he took on was the chief editorship of the <span class="italic">Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology</span>, published in 1994.<br>
<br>Kendrew was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1960, appointed CBE in 1963, and knighted in 1974. He was a member of numerous societies and academies, including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1964) and the Leopoldina (1965). He was a recipient of the royal medal of the Royal Society (1965) and held honorary degrees from several universities, including Cambridge (1997).<br>
<br>Kendrew was highly valued for his sharp intellect, effectiveness, calm judgement, and diplomatic skills, as well as for the breadth of his interests and his sense of humour. Despite being somewhat aloof and reserved he was supportive and encouraging, especially with younger colleagues. He cultivated a deep interest in Renaissance art and music. He was fluent in French, German, and Italian, and spent as much time abroad as at home. A convinced European and socialist, he believed that science could help social development and international relations.<br>
<br>Kendrew died of cancer at the Evelyn Hospital, Cambridge, on 23 August 1997, and was cremated. A large part of his estate formed a bequest to St John's College, Oxford, dedicated to supporting students from the developing world and to promoting music in the college. His papers were deposited at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Both the &#145;sausage&#146; and the &#145;forest of rods&#146; models of myoglobin were given to the Science Museum, London.<br>
