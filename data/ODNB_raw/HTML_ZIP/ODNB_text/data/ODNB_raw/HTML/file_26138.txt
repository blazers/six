<span class="headword">Spencer,  Thomas</span>  (1796&#150;1853), <span class="occ">writer</span>, son of Matthew Spencer (1762&#150;1831) and his wife, Catherine Taylor (1758&#150;1843), was born on 14 October 1796, at Derby, where his father kept a large school. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26139/', "William George Spencer")</script> was his elder brother, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36208/', "Herbert Spencer")</script> was his nephew. For some time Thomas taught at Quorn School, near Derby, and in October 1816 entered St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated as ninth wrangler in 1820, and, after taking pupils for a term, was ordained deacon. While at Cambridge he fell under the influence of Charles Simeon, the evangelical. For eighteen months in 1821&#150;2 he was curate of Anmer in Norfolk, living in the house of the village squire, to whose son he was tutor. For a while he held the college living of Stapleford, near Cambridge. He was also a curate in Penzance, and had sole charge of a church at Clifton for a year or two. He was elected to a fellowship of St John's College in March 1823, which he retained until his marriage in September 1829 to Anna Maria, daughter of Major James Henry Brooke of the Bengal artillery.<br>
<br>In March 1826 Spencer was presented by George Henry Law, bishop of Bath and Wells and the father of Spencer's college friend Henry Law, later dean of Gloucester, to the perpetual curacy of Hinton Charterhouse, between Bath and Frome. He took pupils, among whom was the Revd Thomas Mozley, whose <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>  (1885, 2.174&#150;85) contains anecdotes of Spencer. The population of the parish of Hinton was about 737, and there had been no clergyman and no parsonage since the Reformation. The income was about &pound;80. Spencer built a house, erected cottages, and established a school, a clothing club, a village library, and field gardens. He fought against intemperance and pauperism; through his efforts the rates were reduced from &pound;700 to &pound;200 a year. Wages increased and outdoor relief gradually diminished. He described this achievement in <span class="italic">The Successful Application of the New Poor Law to the Parish of Hinton Charterhouse</span> (1836). When Hinton was incorporated in the Bath union, Spencer was elected a guardian, and was the first chairman.<br>
<br>Spencer's energies were not confined to local claims. He travelled about the country preaching and lecturing, chiefly as a temperance advocate. For Spencer, every teetotaller &#145;was a policeman engaged in repressing crime&#146;. He was a member of the Anti-Slavery Conference, he said grace at the first as well as at the last banquet of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>, and he was chairman of the Conference of Ministers of Religion. His many pamphlets&#151;on church reform, the poor law, education, and the corn laws&#151;had an immense circulation; of some, as many as 27,000 copies were printed. He resigned his curacy in September 1847, moved to London, and devoted himself to the pulpit and platform. In March 1851 he was appointed secretary of the National Temperance Society and editor of the <span class="italic">National Temperance Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>Spencer died at Notting Hill, Middlesex, on 26 January 1853 and was buried at Hinton. He was, Tom Mozley recalled, a &#145;decidedly fine-looking man, with a commanding figure, a good voice and a ready utterance&#146;  (Mozley, 2.176).<br>
