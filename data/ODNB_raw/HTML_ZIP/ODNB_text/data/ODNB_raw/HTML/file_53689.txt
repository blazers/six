<span class="headword">Houldsworth,  Margaret Marshall</span>  (1839&#150;1909), <span class="occ">educationist and philanthropist</span>, was born in Manchester on 14 September 1839, only daughter of Henry Houldsworth (1797&#150;1868), a cotton manufacturer, of Coltness and his second wife, Marianne (<i>d</i>. 1865), daughter of James Burt from Chorlton, near Manchester. Her grandfather, also named Henry Houldsworth, and great-uncle, Thomas Houldsworth, founded a flourishing cotton-spinning business in Manchester. The family also opened a mill in Glasgow before diversifying into the coal and iron industries in Lanarkshire.<br>
<br>Little is known of Margaret Houldsworth's early life but the evidence suggests that it was spent in Manchester, first at the family residence at Ardwick Green and then Oak Hill, Cheetham Hill, with her brothers Walter (1845&#150;1903) and Arthur (1847&#150;1890). When her great-uncle Thomas Houldsworth died in 1852 and her grandfather, Henry, died in 1853 her father, now in his sixties, was freed from the restrictions of a sometimes difficult working relationship with his uncle. He went on to expand the cotton mills in Manchester, was involved in the partnership of the Coltness Iron Company, and became the new laird of the Coltness estate in Lanarkshire, where the family settled. After the deaths of her parents Margaret Houldsworth lived with her brother Arthur at Springfield House, Polton, near Lasswade in Midlothian.<br>
<br>Margaret Houldsworth's move to the east of Scotland led to her involvement in the movement for promoting women's education. In April 1871 she joined the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association (ELEA), an association set up in 1867 to further the cause of higher education of women with a view to gaining admission to the universities. She was on the executive of the association in 1876. After the death in 1877 of Mary Crudelius, the pioneering secretary of the association, and its reconstitution as the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women, Margaret Houldsworth became the vice-president. Once the work of the association was completed, when women were admitted to the Scottish universities in 1892, she was one of the main instigators in the setting up of Masson Hall, a hall of residence for women students at Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>From 1872 Margaret Houldsworth was a member of the Edinburgh Ladies' Debating Society, which brought together many of the women who led the Scottish campaigns for women's suffrage and education in the second half of the nineteenth century. With Sarah Siddons Mair, the founder of the debating society and member of the ELEA, and two other members of the association, Ann Dundas and Mary Jane Urquhart, she helped to set up in 1876 the St George's Hall oral and correspondence classes to prepare girls for local examinations. The inadequacy of training for women teachers led the hall committee to set up St George's Training College in 1886. The need for women teachers to have practical experience in an appropriate setting and the desire to set up a school modelled on the Girls' Public Day School Company saw the foundation in 1888 of St George's School for Girls. At the centre of this new venture were the founding pioneers of Margaret Houldsworth, Sarah Siddons Mair, and Miss Urquhart.<br>
<br>As a comparatively wealthy woman in a family whose male members were steeped in entrepreneurial and business acumen, Margaret Houldsworth was able to provide practical, and particularly financial, help for the women's causes she promoted. She took a much less public role than some. Sarah Mair noted: &#145;she was very quiet and unassuming, very shy and diffident&#151;the heart of the enterprise&#151;but I could never persuade her to speak&#146;  (Welsh, 38). She supported other causes including the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage, the Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for women and children, and the Scottish Central Bureau for the Employment of Women. Margaret Houldsworth died on 29 October 1909 at 3 Ainslie Place, Edinburgh, where she had lived for the previous twenty years. She was buried at Cambusnethan cemetery.<br>
