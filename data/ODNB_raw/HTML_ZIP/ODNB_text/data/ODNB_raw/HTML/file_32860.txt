<span class="headword">Donnan,  Frederick George</span>  (1870&#150;1956), <span class="occ">physical chemist</span>, was born in Colombo, Ceylon, on 6 September 1870, the second of the six children of William Donnan, a merchant of Belfast, and his wife, Jane Rose Turnley Liggate, who was also from Northern Ireland. All Donnan's early life was spent in Ulster, where he returned at the age of three. In 1879 an accident caused the loss of his left eye, but he continued to play sport to a high standard. He attended the Belfast Royal Academy (1880&#150;89), where his chief interest was mathematics and physical science; there being no laboratories in the academy he did some practical work externally. From there he went to the Queen's College, Belfast, where he was remarkably successful in his studies, obtaining his BA from the Royal University of Ireland in 1894.<br>
<br>In 1893 Donnan obtained an 1851 Exhibition scholarship. In that year, before graduating from Ireland, he went to the University of Leipzig. He did a year's chemistry under Johannes Wislicenus (1835&#150;1902) and then joined W. Ostwald (1853&#150;1932) to devote himself to the emerging discipline of physical chemistry. He obtained his PhD <i>summa cum laude</i> in 1896. He finished his European tour with a year in the laboratory of J. H. van't Hoff in Berlin, where he studied the hydrates of calcium sulphate and the vapour pressures of a number of saturated aqueous solutions of single and double salts occurring in van't Hoff's investigations on oceanic salt deposits.<br>
<br>Returning to Ireland in 1897, Donnan sat the MA examination of the Royal University of Ireland. Awarded a four-year junior fellowship, he spent a year at home, &#145;to read more deeply in the literature of physical chemistry&#146;, before proceeding (in 1898) to University College, London, as a senior research student in the laboratory of William Ramsay. In 1901 he became assistant lecturer in Ramsay's laboratory; in 1902&#150;3 he was assistant professor in University College; and in 1903&#150;4 lecturer in organic chemistry in the Royal College of Science, Dublin. In 1904, however, he accepted the new chair of physical chemistry, founded at the University of Liverpool by Sir John Brunner. He supervised the building of the Muspratt Laboratory of Physical Chemistry and was its director from 1906 to 1913. He then succeeded Ramsay at University College, London, where he remained until his retirement in 1937.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Donnan was a member of a number of committees including those on chemical warfare and nitrogen products. As a consultant to the Ministry of Munitions he played an important part in the early stages of the research work at University College on synthetic ammonia and nitric acid, and assisted K. B. Quinan in the designs of plant for the fixation of nitrogen and for the production of mustard gas. He was appointed CBE in 1920 in recognition of his wartime services. His connections with the chemical industry continued after the war: he was research consultant to Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. from 1920 to 1926 and a member of the research council of Imperial Chemical Industries from 1926 to 1939. He was particularly successful in raising money from industry and other sources for scientific research.<br>
<br>Although pre-eminently a teacher, Donnan was internationally known as a colloid chemist and in particular for his theory of membrane equilibrium, published in the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Elektrochemie</span> (1911). The theory had important applications in the technologies of leather and gelatin, but particularly to the understanding of living cells, and how ions and molecules are transported within them and between the cell and its environment.<br>
<br>Donnan was elected FRS in 1911 and awarded the Davy medal in 1928. He received the Longstaff medal (1924) of the Chemical Society, over which he presided in 1937&#150;9, had no fewer than eleven honorary degrees, and was an honorary member of numerous academies and learned societies. His range of interests was extraordinarily wide; his early appreciation of the necessity of a united Europe led him to the study of artificial languages, while in his old age he was much preoccupied with cosmic problems. He was tall, good looking, well built, and of great physical strength and endurance. His face in repose was often stern and rather sad, but when he began to talk he radiated charm and sympathy. A tremendous worker, he kept late hours. He was devoted to his friends but had his dislikes. To accompany him abroad was to take part in a royal progress.<br>
<br>After his retirement Donnan remained in his home in Woburn Square until 1940, when he left only twelve hours before it was destroyed by a bomb. He went to live at Hartlip, near Sittingbourne, Kent, and died in hospital at Canterbury on 16 December 1956. He never married and owed much to two sisters who played an unobtrusive but important part in his life and both of whom died in the same year.<br>
