<span class="headword">Tiptoft <span class="st"> [Tibetot]</span>,  John</span>, first earl of Worcester  (1427&#150;1470), <span class="occ">administrator and humanist</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27470/', "John Tiptoft, first Baron Tiptoft (c.1378&#150;1443)")</script>, and his second wife, Joyce (<i>c</i>.1403&#150;1446), younger daughter of Edward Charlton, fifth Baron Charlton of Powys (<i>d</i>. 1421). Born at Great Eversden, Cambridgeshire, on 8 May 1427, he was educated in arts at University College, Oxford, where he had rooms as a <i>commensalis</i> (&#145;lodger&#146;) for three terms in 1440&#150;41, 1441&#150;2, and 1442&#150;3 with his tutor John Hurley, and for one term in 1443. Upon his father's death, about the end of January 1443, he succeeded to his honours and estates in East Anglia as Lord Tiptoft, and also to Nether Wallop and Brockenhurst, Hampshire, Enfield, Middlesex, and to the Wroth estates at Wimbish in north-west Essex. At his mother's death, on 22 September 1446, he divided the Powys estates in Gloucestershire on the Welsh border with his cousin Henry, son of Sir John Grey and Joanna Charlton. In April 1449 he married Cecily, widow of Henry Beauchamp, duke of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1446), and daughter of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1460); his wife's aunt <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50231/', "Cecily")</script> was wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23503/', "Richard, duke of York (d. 1460)")</script>, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19934/', "George Neville")</script>, the future archbishop of York (<i>d</i>. 1476), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19955/', "Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury and Warwick, the Kingmaker (d. 1471)")</script>. On 16 July 1449 Tiptoft was created earl of Worcester by patent. Following Cecily's death, on 28 July 1450, he married another widow, Elizabeth Baynham, daughter of Robert Greyndour, MP for Gloucestershire, and his wife, the schoolfounder <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107508/', "Joan Greyndour")</script>; the couple had a son who died in infancy. Elizabeth died before 4 April 1452, when in a letter to Henry Cranebroke, monk of Christ Church, Canterbury, Tiptoft asked for prayers, &#145;with special remembraunce of her soule whom I loved best&#146;  (Pantin, 3.103). Elizabeth had been an only child, and her death brought him the Greyndour estates in Gloucestershire. Remaining close to the Yorkist members of his first wife's family, Tiptoft was appointed treasurer of England on 15 April 1452 (an office he held until 7 October 1454), and was already a member of the king's council when on 24 October 1453 he signed a minute calling for the attendance of York at a great council summoned for the settlement of the regency during Henry VI's insanity. On 3 April 1454 he was appointed joint keeper of the sea for three years. On 5 August 1457 he was appointed, with Robert Flemming (<i>d</i>. 1483) and Philip Wentworth, to offer the king's obedience to Pope Calixtus III (<i>r</i>. 1455&#150;8).<br>
<br>Although this mission was not in fact carried out, early in 1458 Tiptoft left England, which was then on the brink of civil war, to visit Italy and make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Letters of attorney to go abroad were issued to him on 28 January 1458, and he and his party arrived in Venice in time to attend the ceremonial &#145;wedding of the sea&#146; on Ascension day (11 May). With the Milanese soldier Roberto da Sanseverino, and the Paduan noble Gabriele Capodilista, he sailed for Jaffa on 17 May. His ship reached Durazzo on 2 June, Cyprus on the 15th, and Jaffa on the 19th. He arrived in Jerusalem on the 25th and bathed in the Jordan on the 29th, departing from Jaffa on 5 July and arriving back in Venice on 6 September 1458. In the autumn of 1458 he resided briefly on the Capodilista estates in the Euganean hills, south of Padua, and began his studies at the university, almost certainly in civil law, which he continued with some interruptions until the summer of 1461. There he made the acquaintance of Ognibene da Lonigo and Galeotto Marzio, and also met two English scholars, Peter Courtenay (<i>d</i>. 1492) and John Free (<i>d</i>. 1465), probably engaging the latter as his secretary. Tiptoft probably spent the autumn of 1459 in Ferrara at the school of Guarino da Verona, where he met Lodovico Carbone, whom he later tried to persuade to return with him to England.<br>
<br>Tiptoft returned to Padua, from where he addressed a letter to the University of Oxford, offering to present a collection of choice Latin works, on which students would be encouraged to model their Latin style. The proposal was met with immediate acceptance in a letter of 1 April 1460, averring that this largess made Tiptoft the successor to the late Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1447) in the university's affections. Although the donation did not take place as planned, several of his books were eventually given to Oxford. In the summer of 1460 Tiptoft travelled to Florence, where he heard at least one lecture by John Argyropoulos, and commissioned books from Vespasiano da Bisticci. Appointed an envoy on 16 May 1459 to convey the obedience of Henry VI to the new pope, Pius II (<i>r</i>. 1458&#150;64), Tiptoft probably travelled from Florence to Rome, where he made a Latin oration which, according to John Free, moved the pope to tears of joy for the beauty of his Latinity. Following another visit to Venice in the autumn of 1460, Tiptoft returned to Padua for a final year of study and book collecting, and commissioned John Free to make a Latin translation of Synesius's <span class="italic">Laus Calvitii</span>, and Francesco Griffolini a Latin version of Lucian's <span class="italic">De calumnia</span>, which he received just as he left Italy.<br>
<br>The accession of Edward IV in the summer of 1461 opened the way to high office. An elegy by Carbone, rejecting Tiptoft's offer of employment in England, asserts that John &#145;&#147;Gunthorp told me that the king has called you home&#148;&#146;  (Weiss, &#145;Tiptoft and Carbone&#146;, 212). Tiptoft landed in England on 1 September 1461, and two months later he was appointed to the king's council. On 25 November he was made chief justice of north Wales, which office he resigned on 28 August 1467 in favour of William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, in return for a life pension of &pound;200 a year. On 2 December 1461 he was appointed constable of the Tower of London for life, and on 7 February 1462 as constable of England was commissioned to try all cases of treason on simple inspection of fact (that is, without a jury). An earlier generation of historians regarded Tiptoft's judicial activities as entailing a substantial extension of the powers of his office. But this is unlikely. Basing its jurisdiction upon civil- rather than common-law principles, the constable's court had long been empowered to proceed to judgment upon the king's record alone, without either indictment or jury trial. It would have been at Edward IV's bidding that later in February, Tiptoft tried and sentenced to death for high treason John de Vere, earl of Oxford, and his son Aubrey, Sir Thomas Tuddenham, and others. He was created knight of the Garter on 21 March 1462 and appointed treasurer on 14 April, an office he held for fourteen months. He accompanied Edward IV north in the autumn of 1462 and took part in the siege that led to the surrender of Dunstanburgh Castle. Next year he was appointed lord steward of the household, and in July 1463 was given command of a fleet that failed to prevent the escape of Queen Margaret from Northumberland to Flanders. On 31 January 1464 he was appointed chancellor of Ireland for life. But he was with Edward IV that spring and summer in the north, where he tried and condemned to death a number of prisoners after the battle of Hexham on 15 May, and Sir Ralph Grey on 10 July, after the surrender of Bamburgh. On 12 August 1464 he was commissioned to arrange a truce with envoys of the duke of Brittany; in June 1466 he was responsible for organizing the famous tournament held outside London at West Smithfield between Antoine, the Bastard of Burgundy, and Anthony Woodville, Lord Scales (<i>d</i>. 1483). That autumn Tiptoft was sent to Wales to capture rebels loyal to Henry VI holed up in Harlech Castle but he could not force them to surrender. In 1467, during the lieutenancy of the duke of Clarence, Tiptoft was appointed deputy governor of Ireland to replace the suspect Thomas Fitzgerald, seventh earl of Desmond. Soon after reaching Ireland he summoned a parliament to Drogheda at which he attainted Desmond and his brother-in-law, Thomas Fitzgerald, the seventh earl of Kildare. There he had Desmond executed, and tortured his two young sons, eventually having them put to death. In revenge for these executions the Fitzgeralds of Munster rebelled and ravaged Meath and Kildare. At a second parliament Kildare was pardoned, and he was later installed as deputy governor, Tiptoft having been recalled to England early in 1470.<br>
<br>Tiptoft remained loyal to the king when Warwick and Clarence rebelled in 1469. Campaigning in the north with Edward, on 14 March 1470 he was reappointed constable of England. On 23 March he received the lieutenancy of Ireland, from which the duke of Clarence had been dismissed, and on 10 July he was reappointed treasurer of England. He accompanied the king south to Southampton, where he had twenty of the earl of Warwick's men who had been captured at sea handed over to him for trial, and condemned them to execution for high treason, adding impalement to the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering. This cruelty outraged public opinion and earned him the reputation, reported in a contemporary chronicle, as &#145;that fierce executioner and horrible beheader of men&#146;  (Gairdner, 183). In October 1470, after the flight of Edward IV to Flanders, and the consequent readeption of Henry VI, Tiptoft left London and took refuge in the Forest of Weybridge, Huntingdonshire, disguised as a shepherd. When a man sent to buy food for him aroused suspicion by presenting an unexpectedly valuable coin in payment, soldiers were sent to search for him and found him concealed in a tree. Taken prisoner and brought back to London, on 15 October 1470 Tiptoft was arraigned and condemned for high treason before the newly appointed constable of England, John de Vere, earl of Oxford (<i>d</i>. 1513), whose father and brother he had sentenced to death. His execution was fixed for the 17th, but the crowd pressing to see him so interrupted his passage by foot that the sheriffs were obliged to lodge him in the Fleet prison for the night. At his execution on Tower Hill on the afternoon of 18 October, he bore himself with quiet dignity, requesting the executioner to strike off his head with three blows in honour of the Trinity. He was buried, head and body together, in the church of the Blackfriars at Ludgate, where his sister Joan Ingoldisthorpe later put up a tablet to his memory. Hated for his cruelty, he was called (by later Tudor propagandists) the Butcher of England. For his swift and ruthless justice Tiptoft earned the reputation that he &#145;juged by lawe padowe&#146;  (Warkworth, 5), that is, he followed summary legal procedures, learned from his study of Roman law. This same charge is repeated by his Italian biographer, Vespasiano da Bisticci, writing in 1490  (Bisticci, 1.419).<br>
<br>On his way to Ireland in the autumn of 1467 Tiptoft had met and promptly married (without the king's licence) his third wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Hopton and widow of Sir Roger Corbet of Morton Corbet, Shropshire. Elizabeth gave birth, on 14 July 1469, to the earl's only surviving child, a son named Edward in honour of the king. Since Tiptoft was not attainted, Edward succeeded <i>de jure</i> to the earldom of Worcester at his father's death. When he died, childless, on 12 August 1485, this earldom became extinct. Edward's heirs were his three aunts, his father's sisters, who probably commissioned Tiptoft's effigy (with two of his wives) on the cenotaph erected in the south aisle of Ely Cathedral in the 1470s.<br>
<br>Infamous for his cruelty, Tiptoft was also renowned for his learning and his love of books, especially the Latin classics, humanist works, and fresh Latin translations of ancient Greek texts. Of his own writings only some survive. These include his English translations of Cicero's <span class="italic">De amicitia</span>, and Buonaccorso's <span class="italic">De vera nobilitate</span>, both printed by Caxton in 1481; the latter was reprinted as <span class="italic">The Declamacion of Noblesse</span>  (Mitchell, <span class="italic">John Tiptoft</span>, appx 1, 215&#150;41). Several of his ordinances, issued as lord constable or as treasurer, survive: <span class="italic">For Jousts and Triumphes</span>  (J. Harington, <span class="italic">Nugae antiquae</span>, 1804, 1.1&#150;11); &#145;For Placing the Nobility&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Tiberius E.viii, and Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 763); and various ordinances published in <span class="italic">Excerpta historica</span> (ed. S. Bentley, 1833). His letter to Oxford University is published by J. Tait  (Tait, 571&#150;2), and those of 1452 to and from Henry Cranebroke are edited by W. A. Pantin  (Pantin, 3.103&#150;4). A supposed work is the compendium of English history compiled under the title <span class="italic">Cronice regum Anglie de diversis historiografis per dominum Iohannem Wigornensem Comitem sparsim collecte</span>  (Hunt. L., HM 19960). Lost works include an oration to the people of Padua and the speech given before Pope Pius II and cardinals at Rome in 1460. A great loss is the <span class="italic">Liber epistolarum Johannis Tiptofti</span>, which Thomas Tanner reports  (<span class="italic">Bibl. Brit.-hib.</span>, 1748, 716&#150;17) was once housed in the library of Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>Tiptoft's real passion was book collecting: as Carbone observed in his funeral oration for Guarino da Verona, Tiptoft &#145;despoiled the libraries of Italy so he might adorn England with handsome monuments of books&#146;  (Carbone, 398, 400). At least a dozen books from his library survive, including classical texts: Lucretius, <span class="italic">De rerum natura</span>, Tacitus, <span class="italic">De oratoribus claris</span>, Suetonius, <span class="italic">De claris grammaticis rhetoribusque</span>, and Sallust, <span class="italic">Bellum Catilinarium</span> and <span class="italic">Bellum Jurgurthinium</span>, which he commissioned from Vespasiano as a gift for Peter Courtenay. Humanist works include Ognibene da Lonigo's commentary on Juvenal, Basinio da Parma's <span class="italic">Astronomicon</span>, and Free's Latin version of Synesius's <span class="italic">Laus Calvitii</span>, and Griffolini's version of Lucian's <span class="italic">De calumnia</span>, mentioned above. Even after taking into account various scholastic collections, John Lydgate's <span class="italic">Fall of Princes</span>, and books of hours, inherited from family members or perhaps confiscated from political enemies, the collection remains heavily classical, reflecting the critical importance of the years in Italy. Tiptoft may thus be justly called the first Italianate Englishman in two different respects. He brought the texts of the &#145;new learning&#146; of the University of Padua, Guarino's school in Ferrara, and Medicean Florence back to English libraries, and he applied the harsh lessons of Italian politics to the service of his sovereign, Edward IV, in ways that in the end were to cost him his life.<br>
