<span class="headword">O'Grady,  Standish</span>, first Viscount Guillamore  (1766&#150;1840), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Limerick on 20 January 1766, the eldest son of Darby O'Grady (<i>d</i>. 1804), high sheriff, of Mount Prospect, Limerick, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1809), daughter of James Smyth, also of co. Limerick. He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 8 November 1780, and graduated BA in 1784. He was admitted as a student at Middle Temple, London, on 19 April 1783, and at King's Inns, Dublin, was in 1787 called to the bar, and joined the Munster circuit. He quickly attained a considerable practice. In 1790 he married Katharine Waller (<i>d</i>. 1853), with whom he had seven sons and five daughters. On 28 May 1803, after the murder of Lord Kilwarden, O'Grady became attorney-general, and he was one of the prosecuting counsel at the trial of Robert Emmet. In 1805 he was made lord chief baron, in succession to Barry Yelverton, Lord Avonmore. He was considered to be a sound judge by his contemporaries, and David Richard Pigot, chief baron of the Irish exchequer, called him &#145;the ablest man whose mind I ever saw at work&#146;. He was renowned for his wit and praised for his advocacy and knowledge of procedure. On his retirement from the bench in 1831 he was created Viscount Guillamore of Cahir and Baron O'Grady of Rockbarton, co. Limerick (28 January 1831). A paralytic stroke in the same year affected his speech and the movement of his hands. He then retired from his house in Baggot Street, Dublin, to his seat at Rockbarton, co. Limerick, and over the next nine years his health steadily declined. He died at Rockbarton on 21 April 1840 and was buried at Aney, co. Limerick.<br>
<br>His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_20621"></a><span class="headword">Standish O'Grady</span>, second Viscount Guillamore  (1792&#150;1848), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 26 December 1792. He was educated at Westminster School and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he matriculated on 4 July 1809. He did not take a degree but entered the army, in March 1811; he became lieutenant in 1812, captain in 1815, major in 1825, lieutenant-colonel in 1829, and colonel in 1842. It was as lieutenant that he served in the 7th hussars at the battle of Waterloo, where his skills as a commander gained him respect. He led his regiment in a charge against the French: the charge was successful, though many losses were suffered, and he was made captain. On 16 October 1828 he married the Hon. Gertrude Jane Paget (1805&#150;1871), the eldest daughter of the Hon. Berkeley Paget. They had several children, including Standish, third viscount (1832&#150;1860); Paget Standish, fourth viscount (1838&#150;1877); Hardress Standish, fifth viscount (1841&#150;1918); and Frederick Standish, sixth viscount (1847&#150;1927). The second viscount died at Rockbarton, co. Limerick, on 22 July 1848 and was buried at Aney, nearby. Some of his letters were published in <span class="italic">Waterloo Letters</span> (1891), edited by H. T. Siborne.<br>
