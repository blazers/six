<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phillips,  Morgan Walter</span>  (1902&#150;1963), <span class="occ">political organizer</span>, was born on 18 June 1902 at Aberd&acirc;r, Glamorgan, the eldest son in the family of six children of William Phillips, a coalminer, and his wife, Sophia Alberta Jones. The young Phillips attended Bargoed elementary school until he was twelve, and then began working in the local pits. He became an active trade unionist and was chairman of the Bargoed steam coal lodge from 1924 to 1926. He was also politically involved, and between 1923 and 1925 was secretary of the Bargoed Labour Party.<br>
<br>Morgan Phillips grew up in a south Wales mining community in a period when industrial and political militancy were at their most lively. He was much influenced by the tradition which in 1912 produced <span class="italic">The Miners' Next Step</span>, and in the year of the general strike he won a South Wales Miners' Federation scholarship to the &#145;marxisant&#146; Central Labour College in London. When his two-year course ended, Phillips chose to remain in London rather than return to almost certain unemployment in Aberd&acirc;r. He became secretary and agent to the West Fulham Labour Party from 1928 to 1930, and he married on 15 March 1930 Norah Mary (1910&#150;1992) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51282/', "Phillips, Norah Mary, Baroness Phillips")</script>], daughter of William Charles Lusher, a postman. He was to remain associated with the borough of Fulham throughout the 1930s. In the early years of the decade he was for a short time on the staff of the National Council of Labour Colleges, and then in 1934 he became Labour Party agent for Whitechapel. Between 1934 and 1937 he was also a member of the Fulham borough council and became chairman of its finance committee.<br>
<br>Until this time Phillips's career had been typical of the general run of Labour Party local organizers. His efficiency and competence were, however, beginning to be recognized beyond the boundaries of the London Labour Party, and in 1937 he joined the headquarters staff of the Labour Party at Transport House as propaganda officer. When war broke out in September 1939 he served for a short time in the Ministry of Information; he was party organizer for the eastern counties from 1940 to 1941, and in the latter year he returned to head office in charge of the research department&#151;a position which was to become increasingly important as post-war plans came under urgent discussion. In 1944 he was selected by the national executive committee of the Labour Party to succeed J. S. Middleton as national secretary. He faced serious competition for the job, most notably from George R. Shepherd, the national agent, from Reg Wallis, Lancashire regional organizer, and Maurice Webb, the youth officer. Hugh Dalton, who was on the selection committee, noted in his memoirs that Phillips's record at Transport House as secretary to the policy committee had been impressive, and that his ability to guide a discussion and state a case in lucid and persuasive terms was well proven. In the selection committee Phillips had a majority of two votes over Maurice Webb.<br>
<br>Phillips remained national secretary for seventeen years. By the time he was elected, his own political views had moderated considerably from those of his youth, and in the 1950s he was to oppose vigorously the left groupings within the party, especially the Bevanites. He backed Hugh Gaitskell for leadership during the bitter controversies of these years, although he and Gaitskell never seem to have been close personally. Immediately after his appointment in 1944 his central concern was the working efficiency of the labour organization in the country for the post-war election. Phillips's ability to infuse new energies into political organizations was never better illustrated, and the part which he played in the 1945 victory was widely appreciated. He was a member of the 1945 campaign committee, with Herbert Morrison, Clement Attlee, Dalton, and Arthur Greenwood, but as regards policy he was much less important at this time than Morrison, who was chairman. In the general elections of 1950 and 1951 his political influence was greater; indeed Morrison always believed that Phillips, resentful of Morrison's acknowledged part in the 1945 election, contrived to limit and curtail Morrison's place and role in the future. Certainly by the time of the 1955 general election Phillips was in a strong position, and the election campaign was largely run by him from Transport House. The political leadership apparently never or rarely met to discuss strategy; but the poor showing of Labour at the polls led to criticism of Phillips himself.<br>
<br>During this decade Phillips was involved in three main areas of political work. The first, and most important, was the unity of the party, which Phillips was convinced should develop around the moderate platform favoured by Gaitskell. Phillips was against a commitment to large-scale nationalization; favoured the acceptance of German rearmament; and was strongly opposed to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament at the end of the decade. The second concern was the rebuilding of the Labour Party's youth section, a matter to which he had referred in his first address as general secretary to the 1944 annual conference. To the 1950 annual conference he explained the new constitution and organization of the Youth League, and he urged the whole party to involve themselves in their youth movement. It remained a minor but troublesome issue for the leadership.<br>
<br>Phillips's third notable interest was with the international movement, and he played a leading part in the re-creation of the Socialist International. He presided over several conferences which preceded the establishment of the International in 1948, and was its chairman from that date until 1957. On behalf of both the International and the British Labour Party Phillips travelled widely, including a visit to Moscow and China with an official Labour Party delegation which included Attlee and Edith Summerskill (August 1954). His last series of visits before he became ill in 1960 were to Central and South America on behalf of the International.<br>
<br>The general election of 1959 took place at a time when Phillips's reputation within the Labour Party was reviving, and although he had no central part in policy making during the election campaign, his daily press conferences were widely appreciated. He had always been an excellent conductor of meetings with the press, where his qualities of conciseness and well-ordered answers found much favour. Early in 1960 his status within the party was raised from secretary to general secretary, and in the same year he published <span class="italic">Labour in the Sixties</span>, an influential pamphlet which achieved a wide circulation and evoked intense discussion.<br>
<br>Phillips had begun to think seriously again about a parliamentary career (he had been parliamentary candidate for Central Nottingham in 1931 but withdrew before the general election), and he made several efforts to obtain a nomination. What finally settled the matter was a serious stroke in August 1960, from which he never fully recovered. He resigned from the general secretaryship in December 1961, and died in Westminster Hospital on 15 January 1963, being survived by his wife and their son and daughter. He was buried at Fulham cemetery, and on 12 February a memorial service was held in the Kingsway Hall, at which Donald Soper officiated and the address was given by James Griffiths MP. His wife was created a life peer in 1964. Their daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99861/', "Gwyneth P. Dunwoody (1930&#150;2008)")</script>, was Labour MP for Exeter from 1966 to 1970, for Crewe from 1974 to 1979, and for Crewe and Nantwich from 1983.<br>
