<span class="headword">Carrick,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1380/81), <span class="occ">chancellor of Scotland</span>, is of unknown origins, but his surname and strong links throughout his career with the diocese of Glasgow may suggest descent from the kindred of the ancient earls of Carrick. He is described as &#145;skilled in decrees&#146; in a papal grace of 10 April 1374  (Rome, Vatican City, Archivio Segreto Vaticano, registra Avinionensia, vol. 193, fol. 345<i>v</i>), and therefore presumably studied canon law at a European university; although sometimes styled &#145;master&#146; in contemporary sources, it does not appear that he was in fact a graduate. Probably before 1360 he had become chancellor in the diocese of Glasgow under Bishop William Raa, but it is not clear how long he held this office. In 1362 he acted as proctor for the Glasgow chapter in a dispute with Bishop Raa, an appointment which hints at the forensic skills of the canon lawyer; these may also have been exercised when he was one of the arbiters in a dispute between Sempringham and Paisley abbeys in April 1373. Carrick acquired the prebend of Moffat, Dumfriesshire, and at some time before 1374 also came to hold the church of Bothwell in Lanarkshire, both charges being in the diocese of Glasgow.<br>
<br>By 1361 Carrick was a papal sub-collector in Scotland under William Grenlaw and had also entered royal service as clerk of the wardrobe, perhaps helped by the patronage of Archibald Douglas, later third earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1400), himself prominent in the king's service. During the 1360s he was successively audit clerk of the king's household and king's secretary or keeper of the privy seal. Carrick resigned the latter to become royal chancellor in March or April 1370, being in charge of the king's writing office or chapel and the great seal. He held this post until February or March 1377, and it is noteworthy that, although appointed by David II, he continued in office when Robert II succeeded as king in 1371. His period in charge of the royal seals was one of significant development in their use.<br>
<br>Carrick was a regular envoy to England under David II, an exchequer auditor every year from 1364 to 1377 except 1365, and a participant in the general and judicial business of parliament during the same period. He was the king's choice to fill the bishopric of Dunkeld when it fell vacant in 1369, but failed to secure the appointment at the papal court. Apart from his links with Archibald Douglas and the diocese of Glasgow, Carrick's later career seems to have been almost entirely confined to the service of the king. He was the recipient of many payments from royal revenues, and after his retirement from the chancellorship he continued to draw a pension from the burgh ferme of Lanark. It was reported to the exchequer audit of February 1379/80 that he had collected this pension, but in March 1380/81 it was said to have been paid to his executors. His death therefore took place between these dates. Carrick's career is an excellent example of how in the later middle ages clerics possessed of legal, financial, and administrative skills could come to play an important role at the highest levels of lay administration and government.<br>
