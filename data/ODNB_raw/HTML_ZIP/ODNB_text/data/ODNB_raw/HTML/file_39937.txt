<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Howard,  Trevor</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Trevor Wallace  Howard-Smith]</span>  (1913&#150;1988), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Cliftonville, Kent, on 29 September 1913, the only son and elder child of Arthur John Howard-Smith, who worked as Ceylon representative for Lloyd's of London, and his Canadian wife, Mabel Grey Wallace, nurse. Until he was five he lived in Colombo, Ceylon, but then travelled with his mother until the age of eight, when he was sent to school at Clifton College, Bristol. He was an isolated child and when neither of his parents returned to England holidays were spent either in seaside bed-and-breakfast accommodation or in the home of one of the housemasters. At school Howard was not strongly academic and it was sport that caught his interest, particularly boxing and cricket. The latter became one of the great loves of his life, together with jazz. Towards the end of his school career he started visiting the local theatre, and he left Clifton to become an actor, getting into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) without any previous stage experience.<br>
<br>Howard's first paid work was in the play <span class="italic">Revolt in a Reformatory</span> (1934), before he left RADA in 1935 to take small roles. That year he was spotted by a Paramount studio talent scout but turned down the offer of film work in favour of a career in theatre. This decision seemed justified when, in 1936, he was invited to join the Stratford Memorial Theatre and, in London, given the role of one of the students in <span class="italic">French without Tears</span> by Terence Rattigan, which ran for two years. He returned to Stratford in 1939. At the outbreak of war he decided to enlist, but both the army and the Royal Air Force rejected him. However, in 1940, after working at the Colchester repertory theatre, he was called up into the Royal Corps of Signals, airborne division, becoming a second lieutenant before he was invalided out in 1943. The stories of Howard's war heroism were fabricated, without his consent, for publicity purposes.<br>
<br>Howard moved back to the theatre in <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> (1943), where he met the actress <a href="#cosubject_76362">Helen Cherry [<i>see below</i>]</a>; they married in 1944. They had no children. A short part in one of the best British war films, <span class="italic">The Way Ahead</span> (1944), provided a springboard into cinema. This was followed by <span class="italic">The Way to the Stars</span> (1945), which led to the role for which Howard became best known, the doctor in <span class="italic">Brief Encounter</span> (1945), in which his co-star was Celia Johnson. Directed by David Lean, the film won an award at the Cannes festival and considerable critical acclaim for Howard. Next came two successful Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat thrillers, <span class="italic">I See a Dark Stranger</span> (1945) and <span class="italic">Green for Danger</span> (1946), followed by <span class="italic">They Made me a Fugitive</span> (1947), in which the roots of British realism in cinema can be traced. In 1947 he was invited by Laurence Olivier to play Petruchio in an Old Vic production of <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>. Despite <span class="italic">The Times</span> declaring &#145;We can remember no better Petruchio&#146;, the opportunity of working again with David Lean, in <span class="italic">The Passionate Friends</span> (1948), drew Howard back to film and, although he had a solid reputation as a theatre actor, his dislike of long runs, and the attractions of travel afforded by film, made him concentrate on cinema from this point.<br>
<br>Howard's film reputation was secured in <span class="italic">The Third Man</span> (1949). He played the character type with which he became most associated, the British military officer, but his capabilities were stretched by his role in this story of post-war Vienna by Graham Greene. Howard had a certain notoriety as a hellraiser, based on his drinking capacity. Under the influence of alcohol he could embark on celebrated exploits, one of which led to his arrest in Vienna, for impersonating an officer. Despite his drinking, however, he always remained reliable and professional, never allowing alcohol to affect his work.<br>
<br>During the 1950s, while often eliciting good notices for his work, Howard frequently appeared in flawed films like <span class="italic">Odette</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">An Outcast of the Islands</span> (1951). An exception was <span class="italic">The Heart of the Matter</span> (1953), another Graham Greene story, in which he produced his best screen performance. Such opportunities were rare, even though he shifted into the American market. In 1958 he received the best actor award from the British Film Academy for his performance in <span class="italic">The Key</span>, but this film, too, failed to meet his high standards.<br>
<br>Although <span class="italic">Sons and Lovers</span> (1960), for which Howard received an Oscar nomination for his performance as the father, and <span class="italic">Mutiny on the Bounty</span> (1962), in which he worked with Marlon Brando, enabled him to move away from playing military stereotypes, <span class="italic">Von Ryan's Express</span> (1965) and <span class="italic">The Long Duel</span> (1967), with Yul Brynner, saw a return to playing officer figures. Even the role of the pugnacious Cardigan in <span class="italic">The Charge of the Light Brigade</span> (1968) revisited military territory, and in this uneven yet innovative film Howard gave a fine performance. Working with Brando and Brynner proved frustrating experiences, leaving him with a mistrust of Hollywood. After the 1960s cinema gave him fewer opportunities to display his ability. His performance as the cynical priest in Lean's <span class="italic">Ryan's Daughter</span> (1971) is one of the most memorable in this over-long film, but for much of the 1970s he was increasingly relegated to cameo appearances in films such as <span class="italic">Ludwig</span> (1973) or disappointing movies such as <span class="italic">Persecution</span> (1974) and <span class="italic">Conduct Unbecoming</span> (1975). However, in 1978 he played a choric-narrator figure in <span class="italic">Stevie</span> with Glenda Jackson, an experience he found satisfying.<br>
<br>In television Howard began to find more substantial roles. In 1962 he played Lovborg in <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> with Ingrid Bergman, and in 1963 won an Emmy award as Disraeli in <span class="italic">The Invincible Mr Disraeli</span>. In the 1970s he was acclaimed for his playing of an abbot in <span class="italic">Catholics</span> (1973) and in 1975 he received an Emmy nomination for his role as Abb&eacute; Faria in a television version of <span class="italic">The Count of Monte Cristo</span>. The decade ended with him reunited with Celia Johnson, giving a moving performance in the nostalgic <span class="italic">Staying on</span> (1980), written by Paul Scott.<br>
<br>The 1980s saw a resurgence of Howard as a film actor. The exhilarating role of a Cheyenne Indian in <span class="italic">Windwalker</span> (1980) revitalized his acting. However, as was the case with <span class="italic">Sir Henry at Rawlinson End</span> (1980), a low-budget black and white film, this impressive movie never reached a wide audience. He continued with cameo roles, including Judge Broomfield in <span class="italic">Gandhi</span> (1982). His final films were <span class="italic">White Mischief</span> and <span class="italic">The Old Jest</span>, both released in 1988. Howard did not abandon the theatre altogether in 1947, returning to the stage on occasion, most notably as Lopakhin in <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span> (1954) and the captain in <span class="italic">The Father</span> (1964). His last appearance on the British stage was in <span class="italic">Waltz of the Toreadors</span> in 1974.<br>
<br>Howard made seventy-four films. He embodied the traditional Englishman: his tight-lipped features and quiet, well-bred speaking voice caught the mood of post-war Britain while, in later years, his craggy face and gravelly voice animated the crusty character roles he played. He lacked the looks and physique to be an archetypal male hero, and his tall frame suited military roles. He failed to fulfil his potential, for he rarely played the lead roles he deserved. Supporting some of the most notable names in the world of cinema, he often received the highest critical acclaim. Howard died on 7 January 1988, at Bushey Hospital in Hertfordshire, of bronchitis complicated by jaundice.<br>
<br>Howard's wife, <a name="cosubject_76362"></a><span class="headword">Helen Mary Cherry</span>  (1915&#150;2001), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 24 November 1915 at Thurgarton, Worsley, Lancashire, daughter of (John) William Cherry, a works manager then serving as a captain in the 45th provisional battalion, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nall. Educated in Harrogate, she trained as a commercial artist, intending to be a theatrical designer, but instead found work in northern repertory; her first part was as an extra in <span class="italic">The Vagabond King</span> in Manchester in 1938. Her London d&eacute;but was in Herbert Farjeon's revue <span class="italic">In Town Again</span> at the Criterion in 1940. Spotted by Robert Atkins, actor&#150;manager of the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, London, she appeared in many of his productions there, at the Westminster Theatre, and&#151;after a season at Alec Clunes's Arts Theatre, where she met Howard&#151;at the Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon. Her Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (1943) was particularly well received. After the war she remained in demand for Shakespeare and Restoration comedy, though she also appeared in many modern plays. Her Ursula in John Gielgud's production of <span class="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</span> at the Palace Theatre in 1955 earned outstanding reviews; her Goneril in his &#145;Japanese&#146; <span class="italic">King Lear</span> the same season was also acclaimed, though critics disliked the production. Her last West End appearance was in <span class="italic">Ladies in Retirement</span> at the Fortune Theatre in 1982. She appeared in more than twenty films, mostly derived from stage plays. She also featured in many television productions and reached a wider audience through the quiz show <span class="italic">Guess My Story</span>. Tall, auburn-haired, and blue-eyed, she was renowned for her elegance and sense of style. She bore her husband's philandering with stoicism, and after his death was quick to defend his reputation. She died on 27 September 2001 at the BUPA Hospital, Heathbourne Road, Bushey, Hertfordshire, of multiple organ failure and cerebrovascular disease.<br>
