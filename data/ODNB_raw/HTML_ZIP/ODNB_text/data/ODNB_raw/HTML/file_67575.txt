<span class="headword">Godward,  John William</span>  (1861&#150;1922), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, was born at 2 Woodbine Cottages, Bridge Road West, Battersea, London, on 9 August 1861, the first of five children of John Godward (1836&#150;1904), investment clerk in a life assurance office, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eborall (1835&#150;1935). The Godwards moved to Fulham and then Wimbledon, where their eldest son lived until leaving home at the age of twenty-six. He initially followed his father's profession, while also studying with the architect William Hoff Wontner from 1879 to 1881. The young Godward did not follow the conventional route of an aspiring Victorian artist; he did not enrol at the Royal Academy of Arts Schools, the Slade School of Art, or in the Paris atelier system. Nevertheless, he must have received formal training at a local art college, as he secured his first entry into the Royal Academy of Arts summer exhibition in 1887 with <span class="italic">A Yellow Turban</span> and his first classical subject, <span class="italic">Poppaea</span>, at the Royal Society of British Artists in the same year. He went on to produce a type of oil painting popularized by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, with women in classical drapery set in a Pompeian-style interior or else on a marble terrace overlooking a Mediterranean sea.<br>
<br>Following the exhibition of his first works Godward left the family home for Bolton Studios in Kensington, where he lived and worked alongside other classicizing painters, George Lawrence Bulleid and Henry Ryland. In 1889 he moved to a larger residence in St Leonard's Terrace, Chelsea, at the time an area known for its artists' colony. In 1888 Godward was represented by a fashionable London dealer, Arthur Tooth, with whom he sold ten oils, until transferring to another West End firm headed by Thomas Miller McLean. A prolific painter, Godward produced between fifteen and twenty pictures a year, which, selling for &pound;25 to &pound;100, provided a steady income. An engraving contract with the noted German printer Franz Hanfstaengl secured extra revenue from reproductions.<br>
<br>Exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy and the New Gallery, Godward's work elicited critical coverage. And yet a typical response describes him as &#145;a disciple of Mr Alma-Tadema&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, 19 March 1890, 4). Alma-Tadema's trademarks appear throughout Godward's work: a fish pond motif, cut-off inscriptions, and the reproduction of familiar classical statuary including a bust of Homer in <span class="italic">A Classical Beauty</span> (1892; priv. coll.), the Parthenon frieze in <span class="italic">In Expectation</span> (1892; priv. coll.), and Atlases holding the cornice of a room in the Pompeian forum baths in <span class="italic">The Toilet</span> (1900; priv. coll.). Likewise the older artist's distinctive representation of female drapery, with a Greek himation wrapped around a chiton, appears in a number of Godward's paintings, as do familiar studio props of animal skins and Pompeian-type lion-legged tables. However, Godward does not borrow from Alma-Tadema alone; his representation of diaphanous drapery is characteristic of Frederic Leighton, while his variegated marble and mosaic architectural decoration recall Edward Poynter. In fact so well was he able to depict materials that the critic of <span class="italic">The Studio</span> reported of <span class="italic">Campaspe</span> (1896; priv. coll.) that &#145;behind a nude figure is a mosaic, so marvellously reproduced that it seems a pity the form obscures it&#146;  (1896, 111). For all this Godward should not be judged as a mere imitator or his work as total pastiche of the styles of others. At his worst he created over-large canvases of dull, flat nudes, but at his best he painted charming pictures displaying harmonious colour and lively texture. It is noteworthy that his models never conform to a classical ideal, and it is their personalized &#145;real&#146; faces and bodies that lend a warmth and individuality to his paintings.<br>
<br>In 1894 Godward moved from St Leonard's Terrace to a larger house in Fulham Road, where he built himself a garden studio. The garden was landscaped with water features and statuary in imitation of a Roman peristyle, but unlike Alma-Tadema or Leighton he never advertised his house as an extension of his art. Far from courting celebrity Godward did not even seek official recognition from the art establishment. Although briefly a member of the Royal Society of British Artists, he was not elected an associate of the Royal Academy, let alone full academician. Godward never married, and his bachelor status, together with his avoidance of London's artistic milieu, have led to his being labelled a recluse; an obituary described him as &#145;of exceptionally retiring personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span>, 1923, 108).<br>
<br>Godward first visited Italy in 1905, and by 1912 he had made it his permanent home, lodging at one of the artists' residences of the Villa Strohl-Fern in Rome. According to a family story Godward ran away with an Italian model  (Swanson, 96), an event that lends romance to a seemingly uneventful biography, although there is no record of him living with a lover in Italy. After he ceased to exhibit in Britain his works were shown on the continent. <span class="italic">Golden Hours</span> (1913; priv. coll.) appeared at the Rome International Exhibition, the Paris Universal Exhibition (1914), and the Brussels International Exhibition (1919); <span class="italic">The Belvedere</span> (1913; untraced) was awarded the gold medal at the Rome International Exhibition. His paintings were still sold through McLean, whose business, when taken over by Eug&egrave;ne Cremetti, continued to represent the artist in London. Italy produced its own classical subject painters like Augusto Bompiani, Luigi Bazzani, and Giulio Sartorio, and hosted such expatriate classicizers as the Polish-born Henryk Siemiradzki and Ludwig von Langenmantel from Germany. Nevertheless, by the outbreak of the First World War modernist art movements across Europe constituted a systematic challenge to conservative art and its institutions. In Britain the position of the Royal Academy, and, along with it, classical subject painting, was being gradually eroded. With the death of Alma-Tadema in 1912 and Poynter in 1919 the heyday of paintings of dreamy women on marble balconies was over.<br>
<br>Undaunted, Godward continued to produce the same scenes, usually one-figure compositions of classicizing women draped or nude. Indeed he is one of the few painters of his generation to specialize exclusively in classical subject pictures, even eschewing portraiture, the most reliable source of income for established artists. Avoiding narrative in favour of mood, colour, and form, many of his titles tend to favour obscure Greco-Roman female names, curiously often beginning with the letter C. The buyer of one such canvas wrote to the artist asking: &#145;You have not answered my question as to how you came to select the name of <span class="italic">Crytilla</span>. Perhaps you will kindly let me know&#146;  (Swanson, 89). No answer is recorded although the name derives from a figure in Aristophanes' <span class="italic">Thesmophoriazusae</span> (&#145;Assembly women&#146;). Other titles have a similar literary or mythological origin: <span class="italic">Callirhoe</span> (1889) is a daughter of the river god Achelo&uuml;s; <span class="italic">Clymene</span> (1891), the mother of the sun god Phaethon; <span class="italic">Corinna</span> (1900), a Greek female poet; <span class="italic">Cassotis</span> (1914), a sacred spring at Delphi; <span class="italic">Crispinella</span> (1921), a Roman aristocrat mentioned by Tacitus.<br>
<br>Godward returned to England in 1921, taking up residence in the garden studio of the house at 410 Fulham Road, which was now occupied by his brother Charles Arthur Godward and his wife, Gertrude. The following year, on 13 December 1922, John William Godward killed himself by leaving on the gas ring in his studio. Inquest witnesses noted that he suffered from &#145;insomnia and acute dyspepsia&#146; and the coroner's verdict was &#145;suicide whilst of unsound mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fulham Gazette</span>, 22 Dec 1922, 3). He was buried in the family plot in Old Brompton cemetery. The unfashionable nature of Godward's oeuvre was illustrated by the fact that only one memorial notice appeared in the press.<br>
<br>In his lifetime Godward's paintings were for the most part bought by private patrons rather than municipal collections and as a result they appear at auction today with relative frequency. A resurgence of interest in Victorian painting from the 1970s onwards ensured that his works increased in value towards the end of the twentieth century. In 1995 Andrew Lloyd Webber bought <span class="italic">Dolce far niente</span> (1904) for &pound;361,000. An 1897 painting of the same title, which was sold for &pound;3200 by London's Phillips Gallery in 1976, fetched $746,500 at Sothebys, New York, in 2010.<br>
