<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Meade <span class="st"> [Mead]</span>,  Matthew</span>  (1628/9&#150;1699), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, the second son of Richard Meade of Mursley, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Joane. After studying at Eton College (1645&#150;8), he was elected a scholar at King's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a fellow on 6 August 1649. He resigned on 6 June 1651, possibly to avoid expulsion for refusing to take the engagement to the Commonwealth. Between 1653 and 1657 he was involved in a dispute over the rectory of Great Brickhill, Buckinghamshire, which (despite support from within the parish and from the triers, who dispatched a troop of horse to back up their presentation of him to the living) he ultimately lost.<br>
<br>Meade married Elizabeth Walton (<i>d</i>. 1707) of All Hallows parish, Lombard Street, London, on 3 January 1655 at St Mary Woolnoth, London. The same year he became morning lecturer at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, where he associated with William Greenhill, the vicar, and on 28 December 1656 he joined the gathered congregation of which Greenhill was pastor. About August 1656 Meade wrote to Richard Baxter, whom he did not know, expressing his admiration for <span class="italic">Gildas Salvianus</span> and asking Baxter's advice on which books of philosophy and divinity to read, subjects where he admitted his knowledge did not match his competence in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. Meade became an assistant to the Buckinghamshire commission on 29 September 1657 and the Middlesex commission on 24 October 1657. Cromwell appointed him curate of New Chapel, Shadwell, near Stepney, in January 1658, and on 1 February 1659 he became a lecturer at St Bride's, Fleet Street. After the army dissolved the restored Rump Parliament in October 1659, on the 31st, Meade, Greenhill, John Owen, and sixteen other Independents sent a delegation to ascertain George Monck's intentions. Appointed preacher to the council of state on 16 January 1660, Meade was assigned lodgings at Whitehall on the 31st.<br>
<br>Ejected from his positions at the Restoration, Meade continued to preach. In his prefatory epistle to <span class="italic">Spiritual Wisdom Improved Against Temptation</span>, a sermon preached at Stepney on 16 September 1660, he indicated he had been accused of sedition for having averred that worship according to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> was sinful. Following Thomas Venner's Fifth Monarchist uprising in January 1661, Meade and Greenhill had to take out recognizances of &pound;300 each for their good behaviour. With William Dell, George Cokayne, and five other nonconformist ministers, Meade published <span class="italic">An English-Greek Lexicon</span> in the same year. That summer, as lecturer at St Sepulchre, Holborn, he preached seven sermons on <span class="roman">Acts</span> 26: 28, seeking to unmask hypocrites and awaken &#145;the formal sleepy professor&#146;; the sermons were published as <i>En olig&#333;i Christianos</i>: <span class="italic">the Almost Christian Discovered</span> (1662). The informer Edward Potter deemed Meade one of the &#145;Chief Ringleaders&#146; among London nonconformists  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/43/107). Ejected from his lectureship at St Sepulchre in 1662, Meade preached his farewell sermon, <span class="italic">The Pastors Valediction</span> (1662), on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 1: 3, exhorting his audience to suffer rather than conform.<br>
<br>Meade subsequently visited the Netherlands, but he was apparently back by 1665. In <span class="italic">Solomon's Prescription</span> (1666) he depicted the plague as &#145;Medicine for a distempered Nation&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>) and vowed to preach despite the government's efforts to silence him. The following year, in <span class="italic">An Appendix to Solomon's Prescription</span>, he blamed England's calamities on the restraints imposed on dissenting clergy and called for an indulgence and protestant unity. On 21 February 1669 he became Greenhill's assistant at Stepney, and the same year they preached to a conventicle of 300 in Meetinghouse Alley, Wapping. Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon's survey also linked him to an Independent church at Woburn, Bedfordshire, and a congregation of presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists at Sibson, Leicestershire. His reputation reached to Massachusetts, where on 21 August 1671 a group of magistrates and clergy wrote to him, Greenhill, Owen, and sixteen others seeking help for Harvard College.<br>
<br>Following Greenhill's death the Independent church at Stepney called Meade as its pastor on 13 October 1671, and on 14 December Owen, Joseph Caryl, George Griffith, and John Collins ordained him. The church inaugurated a new meeting-house on 13 September 1674, complete with four pine columns donated by the Dutch states general. Earlier that year he preached the first of what would become annual May day sermons for young people. Found guilty in king's bench of violating the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> and fined &pound;40 in 1678, he filed a writ of errour, which the court rejected because the judgment had not been entered on the plea roll. When he sought relief from the king, the House of Lords upheld the verdict on 10 July.<br>
<br>Undeterred Meade continued to preach and in November 1681 he, Owen, and nine other dissenters were fined a total of &pound;4840 for recusancy and violating the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span>. At Tunbridge Wells in July 1682 the printer Henry Hills heard Meade, Griffith, and other nonconformist ministers denounce popery and arbitrary government. For preaching to five conventicles at his house in October and November 1682, Meade was fined &pound;180 at the Middlesex sessions, and in December a magistrate and his guards damaged Meade's meeting-house and distrained his goods, though Meade escaped. In the ensuing days he completed an expanded version of his 1681 and 1682 May day sermons, <span class="italic">The Good of Early Obedience</span> (1683), with an epistle, dated 15 November 1682, to Lady Diane Alington.<br>
<br>Following the disclosure of the Rye House plot the government issued a warrant for Meade's arrest on 27 June 1683. With the dissenting minister Walter Cross and the conspirator Zachary Bourne he was apprehended as he attempted to flee the country; one E. M. provided an account of his capture in <span class="italic">A Copy of a Letter</span> (1683). Examined by the privy council in July, Meade admitted having used the alias Matthew Richardson to avoid arrest, acknowledged that John Nisbet, an agent of the radical covenanters known as the United Societies, had lived in his home eight or nine months, and confessed having had contact with the plotter Robert Ferguson. Meade was suspected of having administered a &#145;sacramentall Oath of Secrecy to diverse persons in Wapping&#146;  (U. Nott. L., MS PwV95, fol. 250), but he almost certainly knew nothing of the conspiracy of Robert West and others to assassinate Charles and James, a point confirmed by Bourne. Meade claimed he had criticized Ferguson for writing in opposition to the government. However, he apparently knew about the plans of the Monmouth cabal for an insurrection, as the duke, West, and (under torture) William Carstares testified. In mid-July Meade, suffering from a stone, petitioned Charles for pardon and release, expressing remorse for having opposed the government. A warrant for his release dated 27 July stipulated that he appear in king's bench in Michaelmas term, and he was freed on the 30th after being bound over on his recognizance of &pound;2000 and providing two sureties.<br>
<br>Following Owen's death, Meade succeeded him as lecturer at Pinners' Hall, London, in September 1683, a position which he held until his own death. Charged at the Middlesex sessions in December 1683 with recusancy and attending conventicles, Meade was ordered to conform and publicly confess. In October 1684 he was among 111 dissidents in London and Westminster targeted for arrest. The following year Ferguson recruited him to help raise London for Monmouth. The duke wanted Meade, John Wildman, and Henry Danvers to launch an insurrection as soon as royalist troops left for the south-west but Meade, now increasingly cautious, was dilatory in returning from Essex and failed to assist Monmouth. He evaded arrest by fleeing to the Netherlands in October with the help of Sir John Thompson, the former whig MP.<br>
<br>At first Meade was openly hostile to James's regime, proclaiming in Amsterdam &#145;that Babylon might be destroyed in England &amp; her brats dasht against the walls&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 41818, fol. 125<i>v</i>). However, by April 1686 he had repudiated his militancy and was defending the royal prerogative and dissuading English merchants from settling abroad. This probably explains why the exiled Monmouth rebel Joseph Tiley opposed his appointment as minister to the English clothworkers in Leeuwarden. Before moving to Utrecht in June, Meade preached a farewell sermon in Amsterdam criticizing the use of violence to oppose princes or reform the church. That summer he sought the assistance of the English envoy Bevil Skelton in obtaining a pardon, manifesting his loyalty by praying for James II so fervently &#145;that all the whiggish auditory were amazed&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 41813, fol. 233<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Pardoned on 19 March 1687, Meade returned to England, and in November preached before the lord mayor at Grocers' Hall. On 31 January 1689 he preached thanksgiving sermons for William's victory in the merchants' lecture at Broad Street and to the Independent church at Stepney. Published as <span class="italic">The Vision of the Wheels</span> (1689), the sermons described the revolution as a work of providence. His return to Stepney prompted the congregation to add galleries to their meeting-house in March 1689 and give him an adjoining house and garden in July. He wrote an epistle for Cotton Mather's funeral sermon commemorating his brother, <span class="italic">Early Piety, Exemplified in the Life and Death of Mr. Nathanael Mather</span> (1689).<br>
<br>Meade devoted his final years to the cause of nonconformist unity. In 1690 he joined the presbyterian minister John Howe in promoting the Happy Union of Independents and Presbyterians, and the Common Fund to assist needy ministers, subscribing &pound;100 and serving as correspondent for Bedfordshire, Gloucestershire, Kent, Leicestershire, Middlesex, Oxfordshire, and Lancashire. On 6 April 1691 he preached the inaugural sermon for the Happy Union in his meeting-house on <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> 37: 19. Published as <span class="italic">Two Sticks Made One</span> (1691), it included his argument that &#145;Divisions are very dishonourable to Jesus Christ&#146;  (p. 15). His ecumenical outlook was also reflected in the fact that two of the young men who had lived and studied with him, John Nesbit and James Peirce, became Independent and presbyterian ministers respectively. In 1692 Meade published <span class="italic">A Funeral Sermon</span> for Thomas Rosewell, minister at Rotherhithe. Theological differences led to the disintegration of the Happy Union in 1694, but in December 1695 Meade helped found the Congregational Fund Board to aid needy clergy. With Howe, he wrote an epistle to David Clarkson's <span class="italic">Sermons and Discourses</span> (1696), and he preached the funeral sermon for the London minister Timothy Cruso, published as <span class="italic">Comfort in Death</span> (1698).<br>
<br>Meade died on 16 October 1699, aged seventy, and was buried in Stepney churchyard&#151;Howe's sermon on the occasion was published as <span class="italic">A Funeral Sermon for &hellip; Matthew Mead</span> (1699). Meade was survived by his widow and seven of their thirteen children, Matthew, Samuel, Robert, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18467/', "Richard Mead")</script> (a physician), James, Rebecca (Shrimpton), and Elizabeth. In his will, dated 28 September 1699, he bequeathed more than &pound;2800, houses in London, property in Buckinghamshire, stock in the East India Company, and part-ownership of a ship to his wife, children, grandchildren, and three servants. An anonymous elegy also marked his death: <span class="italic">Tristiae Christianae</span> (1699). Several of his works were posthumously published: <span class="italic">The Young Man's Remembrancer, and Youth's Best Choice</span> (3rd edn, 1701), his last two May day sermons, and <span class="italic">Original Sermons on the Jews; and on Falling into the Hands of the Living God</span> (1836). An uncompromising nonconformist for nearly four decades, Meade was deeply concerned for protestantism's future in England. His support for Monmouth, his enthusiastic embrace of William, and his efforts on behalf of nonconformist unity were manifestations of that concern.<br>
