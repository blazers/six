<span class="headword">Bowyer, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1740&#150;1800), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was baptized on 3 May 1740, at Denham, Buckinghamshire, the third son of Sir William Bowyer, third baronet (1710&#150;1767), of Denham, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1785), daughter of Sir John Stonhouse, baronet, of Radley, Berkshire, MP and comptroller of the household to Queen Anne. On 11 May 1751, as a captain's servant, he joined his first ship, the <i>Glory</i> (44 guns), commanded by Richard Howe; in 1752 he moved with Howe to the <i>Dolphin</i> (24 guns), in which he stayed until 1755. In her he saw service off west Africa, in the West Indies, and in the Mediterranean. After three years in the <i>Princess Louisa</i> (60 guns), the <i>Lancaster</i> (66 guns), and the <i>Royal George</i> (100 guns), mostly in the Channel Fleet, he was promoted lieutenant on 13 February 1758 and appointed to the <i>Nottingham</i> (60 guns), initially in the West Indies and then in the channel. In May 1760 he rejoined Captain Howe in the <i>Magnamine</i> (74 guns).<br>
<br>On promotion to commander on 4 May 1761 Bowyer commanded the cutter <i>Swift</i>, which was captured off Ushant on 30 June 1762 by a much larger French privateer. Bowyer was acquitted at the subsequent court martial, &#145;having done everything in his power for escaping the enemy&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5301). Promoted captain on 28 October 1762, he commanded the <i>Sheerness</i> (20 guns) in the Mediterranean until the peace in December 1763. On 11 November 1768 he married Margaret (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Price), widow of Sir Jacob Downing, baronet; the couple had no children and Margaret died in 1778.<br>
<br>In 1776, after the outbreak of the American War of Independence, Bowyer commanded the <i>Burford</i> (70 guns); he transferred to the <i>Albion</i> (74 guns) in 1778, and took part in the battle of Grenada, under Vice-Admiral John Byron, in the West Indies on 6 July 1779, and in Admiral Sir George Rodney's three actions with de Guichen on 17 April, and 15 and 19 May 1780. On 15 May the fleet, &#145;led by that good and gallant officer Captain Bowyer&#146;  (Rodney's dispatch of 31 May, TNA: PRO, ADM 1/311/217), engaged fifteen French ships in succession. Inevitably the <i>Albion</i>, as the first to engage each ship, suffered severely in men, spars, and hull.<br>
<br>Bowyer returned home at the end of 1781 and on 4 June 1782 married Henrietta (1753&#150;1845), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3346/', "Admiral Sir Peircy Brett")</script>; they had three sons and two daughters. As a commodore he commanded the <i>Irresistible</i> (74 guns), guardship in the Medway, from 1783 for fifteen months. From 1784 to 1790 he was MP for Queenborough, near Sheerness, a seat under Admiralty patronage which his father-in-law had held from 1754 to 1774. In 1785 he was a member of the committee to consider the defences of Portsmouth and Plymouth. On 24 September 1787 he was appointed a colonel of marines. During the Spanish armament in August 1790 he commissioned the <i>Boyne</i> (78 guns) and in January 1791 he paid her off. In April 1792 he inherited the Radley estates from his maternal uncle.<br>
<br>Having been promoted rear-admiral on 1 February 1793 Bowyer hoisted his flag in July in the <i>Prince</i> (90 guns), commanded by Cuthbert Collingwood, in the Channel Fleet. He and Collingwood transferred to the <i>Barfleur</i> (98 guns) in January 1794 and took part in Lord Howe's victory at the battle of 1 June. The <i>Barfleur</i> was warmly engaged in the action on 29 May but early on 1 June Bowyer lost a leg, being caught by Collingwood as he fell. He received a pension of &pound;1000 p.a. for his wound, and the gold medal with chain for the victory, and on 16 August 1794 he was created a baronet. Unable to serve again, Bowyer was promoted vice-admiral on 4 July 1794 and admiral on 14 February 1799. He succeeded his brother in the family baronetcy as fifth baronet in April 1799 and died at Radley on 9 December 1800; he was buried at Radley parish church on 16 December. At his house, now Radley College, the union flag is flown annually on 1 June in his memory.<br>
