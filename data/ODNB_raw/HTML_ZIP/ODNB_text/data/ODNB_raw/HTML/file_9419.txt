<span class="headword">Filcock,  Roger</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1601), <span class="occ">Jesuit and martyr</span>, was probably born in Sandwich, Kent. Nothing is known about his parents or his early life; none of the family appears in the three Sandwich church registers. Filcock arrived at the English College, Rheims, on 15 June 1588 for his early studies. He was then sent to St Alban's College, Valladolid, Spain, on 29 September 1590 with nine other students, entering on 20 February 1591. After completing his studies in theology he was ordained a priest in 1597. He wanted to become a Jesuit, but his superior, Henry Garnet, deferred his admission until he had spent some time on the English mission, to which he was sent in 1598. Filcock's alias in the English mission was Arthur Nayler. He was admitted to the Society of Jesus about 1600. Garnet was about to send Filcock to Flanders for his two years noviceship when Filcock was apprehended.<br>
<br>On 23 February 1601 Filcock was indicted under the statute of 27 Elizabeth for being a seminary priest and entering the country. He was convicted, without any previous examination and without production of any witnesses, on the bare suspicion of being a priest. He neither denied nor admitted his priesthood. He was executed at Tyburn on 27 February 1601, together with the woman who had allowed him to stay in her house, the gentle widow Ann Line, and Mark Barkworth. There had not been a martyrdom at Tyburn since 1595 and it was said that the three were executed to divert public attention from the trial of the earl of Essex, who was executed on 7 March 1601.<br>
<br>Filcock was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987.<br>
