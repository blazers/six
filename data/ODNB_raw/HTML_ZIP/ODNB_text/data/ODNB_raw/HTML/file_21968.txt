<span class="headword">Perkins <span class="st"> [Parkins]</span>, Sir  Christopher</span>  (1542/3&#150;1622), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was born in Berkshire, most likely at Ufton Court. Little is known about his family background except that he described himself as a &#145;near kinsman&#146; of Francis Parkins in his petition to acquire the latter's recusancy fines in 1599  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 9.76). According to the Winchester College lists, he was twelve when he was admitted in 1555.<br>
<br>In 1596 Perkins explained to Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary, that he had been educated first at Winchester and then at the University of Oxford. It is commonly believed that he attended New College because of its traditional connection with Winchester, but there is no evidence to support this. Perkins graduated BA on 7 April 1565. Presumably about this time he decided to leave England for religious reasons. He entered the Society of Jesus in Rome on 21 October 1566. After completion of his Jesuit noviceship in 1569, he studied philosophy at the Roman College. He was transferred to the Jesuit college in Dillingen in Germany to study theology in May 1572. He was ordained priest in Augsburg in April 1575. The Jesuit Henry More, the first historian of the order in England, claimed that Perkins &#145;heard theology at Dillingen with sufficient profit to get himself employed on occasion as assistant lecturer to James [Gregorio] of Valentia at Ingolstadt&#146;  (More, 33). In early 1579 Perkins was teaching philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt, but by November, then stationed at the Jesuit college in Innsbruck, he requested permission to work at the English College in Rome.<br>
<br>The Jesuit mission to England opened with great fanfare in April 1580. Years later, Robert Persons recalled that he and William Allen deemed Perkins fit for the mission. With the approval of the father-general of the order, Everard Mercurian, they wrote to Perkins about this assignment. To their astonishment, Perkins replied:<blockquote>that he would go willingly; but that if he went it would be advisable that he should have dispensation from the Pope for certain things, as, for example, to go to the Protestant churches and to take in a good sense the oath of the Queen's ecclesiastical supremacy and other like things.</blockquote>Persons and Allen attributed the reply &#145;to the simplicity of the people with whom he [Perkins] lived, or to the little information he possessed about English affairs&#146; and clung to the hope that he would eventually embark on the mission  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 101). As late as 16 June 1581, Persons, now in London, still expected Perkins's imminent arrival.<br>
<br>The reasons for Perkins's departure from the Jesuits are unclear. In July 1580 Peter Canisius, father provincial of southern Germany, complained about his troublesome behaviour and made it clear that he would not welcome him back into his province if he left for Rome. Perkins set out for Italy none the less. On 30 September he was in Milan on his way back to Germany (whether he had already visited Rome is not known). In November he found the doors of the Jesuit community in Hall near Innsbruck closed to him: Canisius had carried out his threat. Over the next year Perkins wandered from college to college in the Jesuit province of the Rhineland. On 14 October 1581 he was dismissed from the society. According to the official register in the <span class="italic">Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu</span>, he requested dismissal, but Persons contended Perkins was expelled because of &#145;bad conduct&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 101).<br>
<br>After leaving the Jesuits, Perkins resided in Venice and Rome. There is no evidence that he had abandoned either his priesthood or his allegiance to the Church of Rome. Indeed, his good standing is implicit in his successful intervention in the case of William Cecil, grandson of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the lord treasurer. Most likely between July and November of 1585, Cecil visited Rome where he encountered problems with the Inquisition. A. F. Pollard blamed &#145;an indiscreet expression of protestant opinions&#146;, but Godfrey Goodman and Anthony Wood claimed that he was a victim of vindictive exiles at the English College seeking revenge for Burghley's role in the execution and imprisonment of Catholics  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In some unexplained way, Perkins interceded, despite his later claim that he too was in peril in Rome because he professed himself the queen's &#145;faithful servant&#146;, and accompanied Cecil back to Padua and not to England as many suggest  (Wernham, 2.449). Cecil, however, did carry with him a manuscript written by Perkins in Venice about the Jesuits. Unfortunately the pamphlet was never published and no extant copy has been identified. While he was on the continent, Perkins acquired a doctorate from an unknown university.<br>
<br>By October 1588 Dr Perkins was communicating with Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, and serving as his informant. He was engaged on business &#145;in behalf of the Queen's subjects&#146; and had been received, apparently at Elbing, &#145;as coming from the Queen of England&#146;. He informed Walsingham that he was about to leave for Poland. In reply to the secretary's query about returning to England, Perkins considered his religion a hindrance: &#145;the laws as to it he cannot approve, though he admires the political institutions and would enjoy them, but will not be a judge or disturber of the laws of religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 3.411). He abhorred the Spanish faction among English Catholics but had not abandoned Roman Catholicism. More likely he stressed his aversion to the Spanish faction because of suspicions generated about him by the alchemists Sir Edward Kelley and Dr John Dee.<br>
<br>Perkins met Kelley and Dee in Prague. In June 1589 Kelley accused him of being a papal emissary and of complicity in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth I. In his diary Dee recorded that on 5 August Edmond Hilton departed for England &#145;with my letters to disclose the treason of Perkins&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Diary</span>, 31). By September Perkins had returned to England, perhaps to defend himself against their accusations. On 21 September the privy council instructed John Young, bishop of Rochester, to receive into his custody &#145;one&#151;&#151;Perkins, a student heretofore in Oxford, a man learned and a Doctour of the Civill Lawe&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, 18.136). On 12 March 1590 Perkins wrote to Walsingham that he hoped that Kelley would &#145;deal sincerely&#146; with him, a hope that lacked solid foundation if Kelley followed &#145;the counsel of his friends and ghostly fathers the Jesuits&#146;. Moreover, Perkins produced in his defence a letter from Sigismund III Vasa, king of Poland (ironically a fervent supporter of the Society of Jesus and the Counter-Reformation), and anticipated that Burghley &#145;would lend his assistance to deliver the innocent from the malicious practice of common enemies&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1581&#150;90</i>, 653). By 9 May he had been exonerated and was granted &pound;300 for a journey to Poland and Prussia on the queen's service. Perhaps, at this time, he demonstrated his innocence by conforming to the Church of England.<br>
<br>Throughout the early 1590s Perkins served on numerous diplomatic missions: special ambassador to Poland, Denmark, and the Hanse cities (May 1590 &#150; July 1591); to the empire and various German states (April&#150;September 1593); and to Poland (December 1594 &#150; June 1595). Periodically he begged for preferment &#145;to some living without cure&#146;, so that he could continue to serve the queen  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 4.583). However, such preferment was not offered. With no more income than the annual stipend of 100 marks promised in December 1591, Perkins suspected that the government discriminated against him, despite his years of service and loyalty, because of his foreign education and his former Catholicism. &#145;Some endeavour to insense that I am no great matter by birth, other that I am moved by the dregs of superstitious Papistical impressions&#146; even though, as he claimed on 14 December 1597, he had renounced Catholicism &#145;as soon as he could judge thereof&#146;  (ibid., 7.516). Through the intercession of the Cecils, he secured the deanery of Carlisle in 1596. According to Goodman, Perkins anticipated a quiet life in the country but &#145;being all alone and having no employment, he became melancholy, for remedy whereof he did resolve to come up to London&#146;  (Goodman, 1.331).<br>
<br>On 20 February 1597 Perkins was admitted a member of Gray's Inn. On 16 September, presumably through the intercession of Cecil, he was elected MP for Ripon, West Riding of Yorkshire. He was returned from the same district in 1601. He continued to serve as special ambassador to Denmark (and made the journey three times in the final years of Elizabeth's reign: May&#150;June 1598, September&#150;December 1598, and March&#150;July 1600) and as the government's principal adviser on mercantile matters with the Baltic countries. Two aspirations were eventually achieved: he was appointed master of requests extraordinary in 1598 and Latin secretary on 21 August 1601.<br>
<br>James VI and I increased Perkins's annuity to &pound;100 and, on 23 July 1603, knighted him in Whitehall. In James's first parliament in 1604 Perkins was returned as MP for Morpeth, Northumberland, again through the influence of Cecil. On 20 March 1605 he was admitted commoner of the College of Advocates. After years of acting as deputy to Sir Daniel Donne, Perkins succeeded him as master of requests in 1617.<br>
<br>Goodman, More, and Wood claimed that Perkins, on the basis of his friendship with Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, helped formulate the oath of allegiance to &#145;determine&#146; the loyalty of Catholics after the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, a concern that earlier lay behind his refusal to serve on the English mission unless he could take an oath to his queen. Despite Persons's accusation that Perkins exercised the &#145;office of Inquisitor against Catholics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 101), the latter had little involvement in the persecution of his former co-religionists. He served on parliamentary committees concerned with penal laws, examined at least one Jesuit priest, William Wright, after his arrest in 1607, and discussed religion with Sir Tobie Matthew and Francis Walsingham (alias John Fennell), as they abandoned the Church of England in favour of the Church of Rome, but there is no record that he betrayed Catholics, lay or clergy. None the less, Catholics spread rumours that he was an &#145;atheist&#146; and &#145;given wholly to gluttony and lechery, to feasting and women&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 14.42), or, in the case of Matthew, that Perkins was homosexual: &#145;Now this Sir Christopher Perkins loved music very much, and had a boy whom he was yet suspected to love more&#146;  (Matthew, 70).<br>
<br>On 5 November 1617 Perkins married Anne, daughter of Anthony Beaumont of Glenmore, Leicestershire, and widow of James Brett of Hoby, Leicestershire. She was the sister of Mary Villiers, countess of Buckingham, the mother of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham. Goodman attributed this strange marriage to ambition. However, Perkins married her on the condition that he was not obliged to pay her debts. This clause so outraged Buckingham that he vowed that Perkins would rise no higher. Perkins did not&#151;but whether that was because of Buckingham's intervention or Perkins's old age is not known. Suggestions that Anne was his second wife because of the mention of a &#145;Lady Parkins&#146; in 1611&#150;12 seem to be unfounded  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1611&#150;18</i>, 107). It is highly doubtful that the wife of Perkins would have sent a daughter to a Roman Catholic convent on the continent at that date.<br>
<br>Although not a rich man, Perkins was not penurious in his final years. Brian Levack evaluated his annual income to be at least &pound;450, with two manors and investments in various mercantile operations. Perkins's will was dated 30 August 1620. According to Goodman, he left his wife as little as possible so that &#145;he might revenge himself on the kindred&#146;  (Goodman, 1.335). Anthony Bright was his heir and sole executor&#151;and the recipient of a small estate. Other beneficiaries were Westminster Abbey and the poor of the parish, Gray's Inn, Doctors' Commons, the Clothworkers' Company, and the University of Oxford. He mentioned no relatives but the children of his sister and his wife. Perkins died at the end of August 1622 and was buried on 1 September on the north side of the long aisle in Westminster Abbey. Commenting on his death, John Chamberlain wrote that Perkins &#145;was said to be a papist, or Jesuit, a doctor, a dean, a master of Requests, a knight, and what not&#146;  (Birch, 2.332).<br>
