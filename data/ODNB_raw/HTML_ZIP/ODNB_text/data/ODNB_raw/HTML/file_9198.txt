<span class="headword">Farrow,  Joseph</span>  (1652/3&#150;1692), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, the son of Thomas Farrow (<i>d</i>. in or before 1669) and his wife, whose name is unknown. He was of &#145;religious parents&#146; according to Calamy, and was educated at Boston School. His father had died when he was admitted as a sizar to Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 25 May 1669, aged sixteen; he graduated BA in 1673 and proceeded MA in 1677. On leaving university he became a private tutor at Louth, Lincolnshire, for several years, refusing the mastership of the free school at Brigg in the same county. Farrow was ordained, but was unwilling to conform to the Church of England and could not therefore take up a public ministry. In Lincolnshire he became a chaplain, first to Lady Elizabeth Hussey of Caythorpe (1630&#150;1698), and then either to Sir Richard Earle of Stragglethorpe (<i>d</i>. 1667) or to his son, Sir Richard (<i>d</i>. 1684), before returning to Boston as curate to Dr Obadiah Howe. When Howe died in February 1683 Farrow acted as vicar in the parish until the arrival of a replacement later in the year. For the rest of his life he was employed at Nocton, Lincolnshire, as a chaplain to the family of Sir William Ellys (<i>c</i>.1654&#150;1727), MP for Grantham between 1679 and 1710, a notable exclusionist and whig. Farrow is reported to have been &#145;so pleased with that religious and regular family wherein God had placed him that &hellip; if he had lived never so long he would not have left it by his good will&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 2.444). Among his friends Farrow numbered the bishop of Gloucester Edward Fowler (1632&#150;1714), John Locke (1632&#150;1704), and Thomas Burnet (<i>c</i>.1635&#150;1715), master of Charterhouse School, and he corresponded with John Spademan in the Netherlands. He is reported to have had &#145;a political head, and would give surprizing conjectures about public affairs, by which he foretold the several steps of the glorious Revolution&#146;, and his sermons were &#145;thought not much inferior to those of the most celebrated preachers of the age&#146;  (ibid.). Farrow died, unmarried, at Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, on 22 July 1692, and was buried in the chancel of the church there.<br>
