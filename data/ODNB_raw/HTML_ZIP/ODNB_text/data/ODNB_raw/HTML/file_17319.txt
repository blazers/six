<span class="headword">Mabbe <span class="st"> [Mab]</span>,  James</span>  (1571/2&#150;1642?), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born in Surrey, in the diocese of Winchester, one of the eleven children of John Mabbe and Martha, daughter of William Denham of London. His grandfather, also named John Mabbe, was a well-known member of the Goldsmiths' Company who served as chamberlain of London in 1577. James's father, who was also a goldsmith, was outlawed for debt some time before March 1589  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1588&#150;9</i>, 57). Mabbe matriculated aged sixteen at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 9 February 1588, received his BA on 8 February 1594, was elected to a perpetual fellowship in 1595, and received his MA on 17 October 1598. He was a scholar of the Goldsmiths' Company, but in August 1602 the company voted to turn Mabbe's scholarship over to someone else. Mabbe had already been granted leave the previous April to spend a year in France, and presumably he took the opportunity to travel before embarking on the study of civil law in 1603.<br>
<br>To this period belong Mabbe's first modest literary efforts. In 1598 he dedicated a treatise entitled <span class="italic">The Dyet of Healthe</span> (now lost) to the Goldsmiths' Company, and in 1600 he wrote a Latin commendation for fellow Magdalen scholar Charles Butler's <span class="italic">Rhetoricae libri duo</span>. He contributed one Latin and one Italian poem to Oxford's volume in honour of James I, <span class="italic">Academiae Oxoniensis pietas</span> (1603); in 1605 he presented a Latin oration when the royal family visited Magdalen; and in 1611 he wrote an anagram and Latin verses for John Florio's <span class="italic">Queen Anna's New World of Wordes</span>. An autograph poem addressed by Mabbe to &#145;Sir G. T. K.&#146; (probably Sir George Trenchard, knight) survives in the Bodleian Library (MS Add. 29419, fols. 56<i>v</i>&#150;57). Meanwhile, he served as junior proctor of Oxford in 1606, senior dean of arts in 1606&#150;7, and junior dean of arts in 1609&#150;10.<br>
<br>On 4 July 1609 Mabbe supplicated for the degree of doctor of civil law, but his thirst for travel soon led him in a different direction. In April 1611 he accompanied his former Magdalen classmate Sir John Digby on a mission to Madrid to negotiate a marriage between Prince Henry and Ana, daughter of Philip III. According to Wood, Mabbe spent several years as Digby's secretary in Spain, improving himself &#145;in various sorts of learning, and in the customs and manners of that and other countries&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.53), a statement confirmed by a letter Mabbe wrote from Madrid in 1612 describing various Spanish wonders. In 1613 he was made prebendary of Wanstrow, Wells, but he was absent in July 1615, perhaps travelling again. About this time he sent a copy of the 1613 edition of Lope de Vega's <span class="italic">Rimas</span> (now Balliol 700 a.14) to his Oxford friend Will Baker via fellow Hispanist Leonard Digges, who wrote an inscription on the flyleaf comparing Lope de Vega to Shakespeare.<br>
<br>For about the next fifteen years Mabbe taught at Magdalen (where he served as bursar six times between 1617 and 1630), suffered from gout, occasionally travelled to the continent, and translated various Spanish works. In 1622 his close friend Edward Blount published an elaborate folio edition of <span class="italic">The Rogue</span>, Mabbe's translation of Matheo Aleman's picaresque novel <span class="italic">Guzman de Alfarache</span>. This translation, made partly from Barezzo Barezzi's Italian version and partly from the original Spanish, was popular and influential enough to go through four editions by 1656; Mabbe's modern editor calls it a &#145;triumph&#146; which &#145;might very well pass for a piece of masterly English prose&#146;  (Fitzmaurice-Kelly, xxiii). Mabbe dedicated the volume to his friend Sir John Strangeways of Dorset, and included many marginal notes explaining Spanish customs. In 1623, under the initials I. M., Mabbe contributed a short poem to the Shakespeare first folio, of which Blount was co-publisher; two other poems in the volume were by Ben Jonson and Leonard Digges, both of whom had commended Mabbe's book the year before.<br>
<br>Mabbe's next translations were of a religious nature. His folio manuscript <span class="italic">Advertisements Touching Festivall Dayes</span> (BL, Harleian MS 5077) is dated 27 December 1626. In the dedication to his &#145;worthy friend&#146; John Browne of Frampton Court, Dorset, Mabbe says that this translation (the original of which is unknown) has been delayed by illness, and is an appendix to an earlier work. Secord tentatively suggests that this earlier work may have been Cristobal de Fonseca's <span class="italic">Devout Contemplations</span>, of which Mabbe published his translation in 1629, dedicated to Strangeways and Sir Lewis Dyves and their wives. Secord also demonstrates that Mabbe was the translator of <span class="italic">Christian Policie, or, The Christian Common-Wealth</span>, from the Spanish of Juan de Santa Maria, first printed in 1632 with a dedication to James Hay, earl of Carlisle, and mistakenly attributed by earlier commentators to Edward Blount.<br>
<br>In 1631, under the pseudonym Don Diego Puede-ser (James May-be), Mabbe published <span class="italic">The Spanish Bawd</span>, a lively and thorough translation of Fernando de Rojas's well-known play <span class="italic">La celestina</span> (partly via Alfonso Ordonez's Italian translation and Jacques de Lavardin's French version). He had originally done the translation many years earlier, in a manuscript dedicated to his old patron Strangeways (now Alnwick Castle, MS 510), but the printed version, considerably revised, was dedicated to Sir Thomas Richardson, newly appointed chief justice of the king's bench. <span class="italic">The Spanish Bawd</span> was considerably less successful than <span class="italic">The Rogue</span> in its day, but it has similarly impressed modern critics with its fluency and verbal inventiveness.<br>
<br>In 1633 Mabbe left Oxford and eventually went to live with Strangeways at Abbotsbury, Dorset. There he did his last translation (again as Don Diego Puede-ser), consisting of six novellas of Cervantes printed in 1640 under the title <span class="italic">Exemplarie Novells</span>, with a dedication to Susanna Strangeways, daughter-in-law of Sir John. A second edition, published in 1654 under the title <span class="italic">Delight in Severall Shapes</span>, omits Mabbe's name and his original dedication, and a third edition in 1742 wrongly ascribes the translation to Thomas Shelton. Mabbe was succeeded as prebendary of Wanstrow on 7 December 1642, and presumably died that year. Although the relevant records are lost, Wood says that he was buried at Abbotsbury. He never married.<br>
