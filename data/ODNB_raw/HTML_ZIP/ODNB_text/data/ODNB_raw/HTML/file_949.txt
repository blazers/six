<span class="headword">Ayrton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Chaplin]</span>,  Matilda Charlotte</span>  (1846&#150;1883), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Honfleur, France, the daughter of John Clarke Chaplin, a solicitor. Her early studies were in drawing and painting and she used her artistic talents throughout her subsequent career. But she began what was to prove a long struggle to qualify as a doctor about 1867. She attended classes at the Medical College for Women in London, opened in 1864 to train women in midwifery, and she passed the preliminary examination for the licence of the Society of Apothecaries just before the society closed its professional examinations to candidates who had not attended regular medical schools. At the time this move appeared to preclude women's obtaining any qualification that would entitle them to have their names entered on the General Medical Council's register. However, in 1869, Sophia Jex-Blake was pressing to be admitted to medical classes at Edinburgh University. The university court refused consent for mixed classes and was not prepared to make special arrangements for Jex-Blake alone, but conceded that special classes for a group of women might be possible. Jex-Blake advertised for women to join her and Matilda Chaplin was the second to do so. In October 1869 Chaplin, together with four other women, passed the matriculation examination for Edinburgh University, the first women to be fully enrolled at a modern British university.<br>
<br>These five with two others who joined them the following year were to become known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61136/', "Edinburgh seven")</script> or &#145;septem contra Edinam&#146; as over the next four years they battled in private and, in the later stages, in public for access to the full range of medical instruction and the right to graduate. This culminated in a lawsuit against the university. Chaplin was &#145;not individually in favour of such bellicose means being employed but she loyally worked with the little band of students, of whom she was so distinguished a member&#146;  (Orme, 345). In 1870&#150;71 Chaplin took high honours in anatomy and surgery at the extramural examinations of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Edinburgh. She also wrote several articles for the <span class="italic">Medical Press and Circular</span> at this same time and in 1871 attended some medical classes in Paris.<br>
<br>In June 1873 the seven's legal battle for the right to graduate was finally lost. But in the meantime Chaplin had married her cousin, the physicist and engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30509/', "William Edward Ayrton (1847&#150;1908)")</script>, on 21 December 1871. In 1873 her husband was appointed professor of physics and telegraphy at the new Imperial Engineering College in Tokyo and Mrs Ayrton went with him to Japan. Before leaving England she obtained a certificate in midwifery from the London Obstetrical Society and in Tokyo she started a school for Japanese midwives, lecturing there herself with the aid of an interpreter. She also continued with private medical studies and wrote and illustrated several newspaper articles about her travels.<br>
<br>In 1877 Mrs Ayrton became ill and she and her young daughter Edith Chaplin Ayrton (who later married the writer Israel Zangwill) returned to London. Here Ayrton recommenced her medical training at the London School of Medicine for Women; she obtained her MD in Paris in 1879 and in 1880 became a licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, where she, the only female candidate, headed the pass lists in medicine and midwifery. She then began practice in Sloane Street, London, while studying diseases of the eye at the Royal Free Hospital. She was a founder member of a club for women students in Paris and of the Somerville Club in London, which provided rest, recreation, and assistance for women students. Through this club Ayrton was a much valued adviser to many young women. She continued to write articles on life in Japan and other topics and, in 1879, she published a book entitled <span class="italic">Child Life in Japan</span>, illustrated by her own sketches. But by 1880 her health was breaking down and the signs of tuberculosis were manifest. She was obliged to winter abroad, first in Algiers and then in Montpellier, continuing her medical studies in both places. Ayrton died of tuberculosis on 19 July 1883, aged thirty-seven, at her home, 68 Sloane Street, Chelsea, London, and was buried in Brompton cemetery on 24 July.<br>
