<span class="headword">Mac Cuarta,  S&eacute;amas Dall</span> <span class="st"> [James MacCourt or Maccuairt]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1645&#150;1733), <span class="occ">Irish-language poet</span>, may have been born in the area known as Cr&eacute;amhainn (the tribal territory of Creamhthainn or U&iacute; Chreamhthainn in early medieval times), on the borders of co. Louth and co. Monaghan, although some authorities have argued for a birthplace in the vicinity of Dundalk, others for one in co. Meath, and still others&#151;with perhaps greater probability&#151;in the district of Omeath, co. Louth, with which he is most closely identified. He spent most of his life in and around Omeath but also had close links with the vicinity of the Boyne, particularly with the townland of Kellystown in the parish of Monknewtown, barony of Upper Slane. He lost his sight as a boy, in unexplained circumstances, and&#151;like many of his contemporaries who shared his affliction&#151;spent most of his life as a wandering minstrel.<br>
<br>Mac Cuarta's poetry reflects a familiarity with Irish literature and history, the classics (Greek and Latin), and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His surviving work&#151;the earliest of which appears to date from about 1690&#151;runs to more than fifty poems and is to be found in approximately 130 manuscripts. One of the manuscripts dates from as early as 1724&#150;5 and no fewer than fifteen of his poems occur in manuscripts that were penned either during his lifetime or immediately after his death.<br>
<br>Much of Mac Cuarta's work echoes the political events of his time, such as the catastrophic battle of Aughrim (1691)&#151;which inspired &#145;Tuireamh Shomhairle Mhic Dhomhnaill&#146; (a lament for a Catholic leader who fell in that battle)&#151;and the subsequent subjugation of his people by the English, who are condemned both as foreigners and heretics. (Strangely enough, Mac Cuarta does not mention the battle of the Boyne.) He bitterly laments the loss of the traditional local chieftains, the O'Neills of the Fews, in south Armagh, where their great castle at Glasdrummond now lay broken and deserted. He is especially bitter about those Irishmen whom he deems to have betrayed their compatriots and accordingly praises local men of non-noble lineage&#151;whom others consider upstarts&#151;who are willing to challenge the English, however futile their efforts, and he never loses hope that eventually the Englishry will be destroyed and the exiled leaders will return.<br>
<br>Mac Cuarta's great love of nature (despite his blindness) is most poignantly reflected in his poem to the cuckoo&#151;&#145;F&aacute;ilte don &eacute;an&#146; (&#145;Welcome to the bird&#146;)&#151;said to date from 1707. His work includes a body of religious poetry that is characterized by strong Marian devotion and a fiercely anti-protestant tone. Other poems on ecclesiastical matters include one welcoming the appointment of James O'Shiel OFM as bishop of Down and Connor in 1717 and a lament for a priest named Pilib &Oacute; Raghallaigh. His poems of &#145;exile&#146; (which relate to his being some twenty or thirty miles removed from some of his favourite haunts), &#145;Beannacht B&oacute;inne&#146; and &#145;D&uacute;iche Chr&eacute;amhainn&#146;, are noteworthy, as are his elegies, particularly that on his close friend Niall &Oacute;g Mac Murchaidh who died in 1714. He also mourned the death of his two brothers Ruair&iacute; and Brian, in 1717. He composed numerous poems in praise of chieftains&#151;Toirealach &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, Brian Mac Naois, Brian Mac Eoghain, Mac Airt U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, the baron of Slane, and others&#151;as well as several in praise of women; these latter works are rather pedestrian and lacking in passion.<br>
<br>One of Mac Cuarta's most justly celebrated works is his well-crafted, delicious little satire &#145;Tithe Chorr an Chait&#146; on the niggardly inhabitants of the village of Corrakit. A more bitter one is his attack, &#145;Scanradh an Daill&#146;, on the miscreant who had callously stolen 18 guineas from the blind poet. Mac Cuarta was a noted practitioner of the verse form known as &#145;tr&iacute; rainn agus amhr&aacute;n&#146; (consisting of three quatrains in traditional&#151;albeit rather loose&#151;syllabic metre and a stanza in song metre). He was also famed for his sociability and his great friendship with his fellow poets and musicians, most notably Niall &Oacute;g Mac Mhurchaidh, P&aacute;draig Mac Giolla Fhiond&aacute;in (1665&#150;1733), and Toirdhealbhach &Oacute; Cearbhall&aacute;in 
    (Turlogh O'Carolan; 1670&#150;1738)
  &#151;they praised, mocked, and mourned one another, as appropriate. For example, Mac Cuarta lamented Niall &Oacute;g and Mac Giolla Fhiond&aacute;in lamented Mac Cuarta. From the latter lament comes the knowledge that Mac Cuarta died in February 1733, but there is no indication of where he was buried. Two editions of his writings (neither complete) have appeared, the first in 1925 and the second in 1971.<br>
