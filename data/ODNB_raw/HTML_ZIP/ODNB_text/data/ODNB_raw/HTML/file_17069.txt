<span class="headword">Lovibond,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the son of Edward Lovibond (<i>d</i>. 1737), a director of the East India Company, and his wife, Mary, and was baptized at St James's, Clerkenwell, London, on 6 July 1723. He was educated at Kingston upon Thames under Richard Wooddeson and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he matriculated as gentleman commoner on 15 May 1739. Having inherited a competence from his father, Lovibond spent the greater part of his life in the neighbourhood of Hampton, Middlesex, &#145;where he seems to have divided his time between the occupations of rural economy, the amusements of literature and poetry, and the gaieties of elegant society&#146;  (Anderson, 577). On 26 December 1744 he married Catherine Hamilton, third daughter of Gustavus Hamilton of King's county, Ireland. The marriage was reputed to have been unhappy. Lovibond died on 27 September 1775 at his home in Hampton, which had formerly belonged to Charles Jervas. In 1776 Horace Walpole bought some pictures, including one by Cowley, &#145;at Mr. Lovibond's sale&#146;, which he had admired previously on a visit to Lovibond's estate in the early 1770s (Walpole, letter to Lady Ossory, 20 June 1776; &#145;Walpole's journals&#146;, 69).<br>
<br>Through his involvement with Edward Moore's weekly newspaper <span class="italic">The World</span>&#151;to which he contributed five papers  (Chalmers, 283&#150;4)&#151;Lovibond may have been acquainted with Walpole, who was one of the paper's original contributors. His best-known piece, &#145;Tears of Old May Day&#146;, occasioned by &#145;the reforming our style or calendar to the general usage of the rest of Europe&#146;, first appeared in <span class="italic">The World</span> on 25 July 1754 and was praised for its &#145;plaintive melody which has only been surpassed by the inimitable Churchyard Elegy&#146;  (Anderson, 577, 579). This poem, along with another entitled &#145;Mulberry Tree&#146;, on the contrasting characters of David Garrick and Johnson, was later noted with approval by Boswell  (Boswell, 1.70&#150;71).<br>
<br>Although it circulated privately in his lifetime, the majority of Lovibond's poetry was published posthumously as <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1785) under the superintendence of his brother, Anthony Lovibond Collins. Lovibond's poetical voice chiefly draws its inspiration from Gray, though in the case of &#145;Julia's Printed Letter&#146; Pope's &#145;Eloisa to Abelard&#146; is evidently his model. His &#145;demi-platonic&#146; love verses directed to Miss K&#151; P&#151;, identified by Chalmers as Miss Kitty Philips, also suggest the influence of his subject's namesake, Katherine Philips, the matchless Orinda. Lovibond's poems were reprinted in Anderson's <span class="italic">British Poets</span> (1794), together with a panegyric sneeringly described by Croker as &#145;hyperbolic&#146;  (Boswell, 1.71). His life was subsequently revised by Alexander Chalmers for the <span class="italic">General Biographical Dictionary</span> (1816) and his edition of the <span class="italic">British Poets</span> (1820). Selections of his poetry reappeared in two early nineteenth-century collections.<br>
