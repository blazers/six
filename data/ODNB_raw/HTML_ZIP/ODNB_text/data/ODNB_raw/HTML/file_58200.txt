<span class="headword">Heren,  Louis Philip</span>  (1919&#150;1995), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 6 February 1919 in Shadwell, in the docklands of Wapping, London, the second son and third and youngest child of William Heren (<i>d</i>. 1923/4), a machine minder on <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and his wife, Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keller. His life was a true <span class="italic">Times</span> romance of the messenger boy who almost became editor. His paternal grandfather was a French Basque; his maternal grandfather a German Jew; and he also had Irish blood. He grew up in the East End during the depression. His father died when Heren was four, and his mother supported the family by running a greasy-spoon caf&eacute; near the gates of London Docks. She was offended when Heren called his autobiography <span class="italic">Growing up Poor in London</span>. She said that &#145;Growing up among the poor in London&#146; would have been accurate.<br>
<br>Heren was educated at St George's, the local grammar school, where his English teacher introduced him to Dickens, G. A. Henty, and Conrad, and kindled his lifelong interest in gripping narrative and rattling good yarns. He became an autodidact and avid borrower of books from the public library. In those days <span class="italic">The Times</span> was a paternalist club that looked after &#145;<span class="italic">Times</span> men&#146;. So in 1933 it hired Heren, when he left school aged fourteen, as a messenger in the publicity department. <span class="italic">The Times</span> proved a substitute for secondary and university education. An assistant editor spotted the messenger boy reading Conrad's <span class="italic">Nostromo</span> in a corner, and mentioned the prodigy to his colleagues. Stanley Morison, the <i>&eacute;minence grise</i> of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, took an interest in the boy and helped him to become a reporter. Heren's first assignment for <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1937 was to report the East End parties celebrating the coronation of George VI. As a junior reporter he would volunteer for weekend duty in Printing House Square, which he described as &#145;a very cushy job&#146;. He loved having the old house to himself, sleeping in a bed with crisp linen sheets after a dinner served by &#145;a manservant from the chief proprietor's house&#146;, being called on Sunday morning with a cup of tea, and then having a breakfast of bacon and eggs in the editorial sitting room while reading the Sunday papers and marking stories worth following up  (Heren, <span class="italic">Growing up Poor in London</span>, 136).<br>
<br>In 1939 Heren volunteered for the Royal Artillery, and served as a gunner non-commissioned officer in France, Iceland, and Greenland. He was then commissioned into the Royal Tank regiment, serving in India, Burma, the Yunnan province of China, and south-east Asia. War service gave him a taste for travel. So <span class="italic">The Times</span> transferred him to the foreign department, and in 1947 he was appointed the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent to India, where he described the massacres of partition with the sensitivity and courage of a front-line reporter. On 16 June 1948 he married Patricia Cecilia Regan (1924/5&#150;1975), daughter of Thomas Francis Regan, a civil servant in the Air Ministry. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Heren was next posted to Palestine, which had become a shambles of terrorism and bloodshed, culminating in the birth of Israel in 1948, when Britain withdrew from its mandate. When Ian Morrison, the staff correspondent covering the Korean War, was killed by a landmine, Heren was sent to replace him. For the next quarter of a century Heren flew towards the sound of the guns and the political drums as brilliantly as his predecessor on <span class="italic">The Times</span>, William Howard Russell, the first professional war correspondent, a century before. While he was in Korea, Heren compared the relief of having filed a story under gunfire and deadline to &#145;having a good shit&#146;. He was subsequently based in Singapore (1951&#150;3), Delhi (1953&#150;5), and Bonn (1955&#150;60). While he was covering the communist uprising in Malaya he had serious brushes with the Templar administration. The reputation of <span class="italic">The Times</span> being what it then was, the good and the great regarded its staff as just another arm of the establishment. Neither Heren's working-class background nor his bolshie temperament responded to this old boy network. He said: &#145;Always ask yourself why these lying bastards are lying to you&#146;  (Heren, <span class="italic">Growing up on &#145;The Times&#146;</span>, 26). From every country where he reported his office was bombarded with complaints from those in authority, whose feathers he had ruffled.<br>
<br>In 1960 Heren was appointed head of the Washington bureau. He arrived there in time for the inauguration of President Kennedy, but the succeeding Johnson era was more suited to Heren's skills than the glitter of Camelot. He reported the upsurge and climax of racial tension and civil rights disturbances, and the rise in opposition to American involvement in Vietnam, recording the anguish and divisions that split the American nation as it became bogged down in a war that could not be won. His decade in Washington was the pinnacle of Heren's career. By 1970 he was ready to come home out of the cold, mainly because his wife was ill (in fact dying). He returned as deputy editor (foreign). But he found life in London anticlimactic and frustrating. Like many foreign correspondents he was something of a lone wolf and a prima donna. He would not write leaders because they were unsigned. He was not a team player in the court of office politics, for he was still at heart a reporter from the front lines. He caused outrage in some quarters when he invited Menachem Begin to lunch at <span class="italic">The Times</span>. At the time Begin was leader of the Israeli opposition, and still <i>persona non grata</i> with the British government because of his terrorist activities during the British mandate in Palestine. In 1979 he provoked similar outrage when he invited Anthony Blunt to a <span class="italic">Times</span> lunch immediately after Blunt's traitorous activities had been exposed. Both lunches brought the paper front-page scoops.<br>
<br>Heren was reckoned a favourite to succeed William Rees-Mogg as editor when Kenneth Thomson sold <span class="italic">The Times</span> to Rupert Murdoch in 1981. He applied for the post, and wrote a long memorandum to the new proprietor about changes that he believed were necessary to make the paper profitable and to restore its former glories. That appointment would have made Heren a legend in his own <span class="italic">Times</span>, worthy of a Samuel Smiles or Horatio Alger penny novel about the virtuous apprentice. But Heren's bid was unsuccessful, and he suffered a second disappointment when he was deprived of the deputy editorship. His final year at <span class="italic">The Times</span> became embittered, and in 1981 he left the paper to which he had devoted his life to concentrate on writing more books about himself, the press, and America.<br>
<br>Heren was a stocky, pugnacious, chippy man, with a dangerous look in his eye. He enjoyed good company and good food in fine surroundings, especially his beloved Garrick Club. He would recommend his favourite restaurant in any city in the world. He was the best war correspondent of his generation, and a proper &#145;<span class="italic">Times</span> man&#146;. He died of a heart attack at his home, Fleet House, Vale of Health, Hampstead, London, on 26 January 1995. After a funeral at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Hampstead, he was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 2 February. He was survived by his son and three daughters. A memorial service was held at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, on 28 March 1995.<br>
