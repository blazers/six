<span class="headword">King,  Edward</span>, Viscount Kingsborough  (1795&#150;1837), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born on 16 November 1795, was the eldest son of the family of three sons and two daughters of George King, third earl of Kingston in the peerage of Ireland (1771&#150;1839), and Lady Helena Moore (1773&#150;1847), only daughter of Stephen Moore, first Earl Mountcashell. After his father succeeded to the earldom in 1799 he was known by the courtesy title of Viscount Kingsborough. He matriculated at Oxford from Exeter College on 25 June 1814, and in Michaelmas term 1818 gained a second class in classics, but did not graduate. In 1818 and again in 1820 he was elected MP for Cork county, but resigned his seat in 1826 in favour of his younger brother Robert.<br>
<br>Kingsborough was introduced by the bibliophile Sir Thomas Phillipps to Bodley's librarian Bulkeley Bandinel, who showed him the great Mexican manuscript the <span class="roman">Codex Mendoza</span> in the Bodleian Library. This determined Kingsborough to devote his life to the study of the antiquities of Mexico. Again with Phillipps's encouragement, Kingsborough promoted and edited, with copious notes, a magnificent work entitled <span class="italic">Antiquities of Mexico, Comprising Facsimiles of Ancient Mexican Paintings and Hieroglyphics</span> (9 vols., 1830&#150;48). Seven volumes were published during his lifetime. Four copies were printed on vellum, with the plates coloured. The drift of Kingsborough's speculations is to establish the colonization of Mexico by the Israelites. The enterprise cost him more than &pound;32,000. He incurred heavy debts in the preparation of his book, to paper makers and others. He was arrested, apparently in connection with having stood security for a debt of his father's, and was lodged in the sheriff's prison, Dublin, where he caught typhus fever and died within a few days, on 27 February 1837. Kingsborough, who was unmarried, was buried at Mitchelstown. Had he lived, he would have succeeded to the earldom of Kingston and to a substantial income.<br>
<br>Sales of Kingsborough's manuscripts and of the remaining stock of the <span class="italic">Antiquities</span> were conducted by Charles Sharpe in Dublin on 1 November 1842 and 14 March 1843. On 24 May 1854 further manuscripts were included in a mixed sale in Dublin. Sir Thomas Phillipps was a substantial purchaser at the sales.<br>
