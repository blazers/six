<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  William</span>  (1761?&#150;1842), <span class="occ">improver of cotton machinery</span>, was born probably in 1761, and baptized on 14 November 1761, at Mellor, Derbyshire, the son of William Radcliffe, a weaver, and his wife, Mary. His early life is obscure, but in 1785 he married Sarah Jackson, the daughter of Oliver Jackson, a farmer at Mellor, and four years later began business at Mellor as a spinner and weaver. He produced warps for the hand-loom weavers employed by Samuel Oldknow and also gave out some work to muslin weavers on his own account. In 1794, concurrent with the sudden collapse of Oldknow's integrated cotton-manufacturing empire, Radcliffe decided to add weaving to his capitalist activities. With wartime needs for textile products, and with the spread of the new cotton-spinning technologies (waterframe, jenny, and mule), demand pushed up weaving rates and expanded hand-loom weaving, but probably not by as much as Radcliffe claimed. He evidently profited from adding weaving to spinning: he claimed to employ more than 1000 weavers across three counties in the late 1790s, exporting the plain and fancy goods they made. To support expansion, in 1799 Radcliffe took as partner Thomas Ross of Montrose, the son of a rich Scottish merchant, who brought &pound;6000 to the business. Ross had charge of the sales side, and travelled to the continent. Around this time the firm also moved its headquarters to the Muslin Hall at Stockport. In 1801 Radcliffe settled his family at Stockport; he became captain in the Stockport Loyal Volunteers in 1803 and was elected manorial mayor of the town in 1804.<br>
<br>Radcliffe's espousal of weaving pursued political and technological directions as well as a commercial route. In April 1800, in response to a trade depression and the prospect of the export of British yarns to rival manufacturers abroad (especially the German states), Radcliffe proposed to a meeting of Stockport manufacturers held at The Castle inn that Britain's weaving capacity could be increased by mechanization, providing export of yarns was prohibited. He canvassed his mercantilist views and in 1811 wrote a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Exportation of cotton yarns: the real cause of the distress that has fallen upon the cotton trade for a series of years past</span>.<br>
<br>A technological breakthrough in weaving was adumbrated in the late 1780s by the primitive power-loom of Edmund Cartwright, and Radcliffe publicly committed himself to the goal of mechanizing weaving. He and his partner used their combined resources of &pound;11,000 to buy the empty factory built by Samuel Oldknow in the Hillgate, Stockport. Here they concentrated production and recruited Thomas Johnson of Bredbury, near Stockport, an ingenious weaver, to work on the problem, Radcliffe specifying objectives and Johnson designing mechanical solutions. Modifications were recorded in four patents, taken out in Johnson's name (to conceal their source and value), between 1803 and 1807. The most important, dated 2 June 1804, was for the dressing-frame which starched the warp before it was put into the loom. With Johnson's aid Radcliffe also added mechanical movements to the loom, chiefly the taking up of the cloth by the motion of the lathe. Built with an iron frame, this superior hand-loom was known as the &#145;dandyloom&#146;. Together with Robert Miller's cam-driven shedding principle (1796) and William Horrocks's variable batten speed motion (1813), Radcliffe's take-up motion formed the basis of the first truly practical power-loom, built by Richard Roberts (1822).<br>
<br>By 1806 Radcliffe's profits from hand-loom weaving, now concentrated mostly in workshops, amounted to &pound;90 to &pound;100 a week, and his patent royalties (sold only to British manufacturers) to about &pound;50 a week. These increases in scale and investment overstretched him, however. By now he had separated from his partner and was raising capital by mortgaging his Mellor estate, his Stockport premises, and his patents. He raised a loan of &pound;5000 from four &#145;gentlemen&#146;, but still his credit contracted, and in March 1807 he was declared bankrupt. The loan of &pound;2000 from four friends enabled him to resume business soon afterwards, but he was unable to pay off all his debts and gain a discharge from bankruptcy until 1817. Meanwhile his patented ideas were freely borrowed by rivals, and his fellow manufacturers never kept their promise to fight for restrictions on yarn exports.<br>
<br>The Luddites on 14 March 1812 broke into Radcliffe's mill and residence (as well as those of other manufacturers) and destroyed both his machinery and furniture. His wife was so alarmed and injured by the rioters that she died a few weeks later, on 18 May 1812, aged forty-seven. In old age, and embittered by his struggles, Radcliffe published <span class="italic">Origin of the New System of Manufacture, Commonly called Power-Loom Weaving</span> (1828), a rambling set of recollections, and blamed the &#145;Foreign Anglo Junto&#146; centred on Manchester for all his troubles.<br>
<br>Radcliffe gave evidence in 1808 in the inquiry which resulted in a parliamentary grant of &pound;10,000 to Edmund Cartwright for his inventions. Efforts in 1825, 1834, and 1836 to obtain public recognition of Radcliffe's services were in vain until, in the last year of his life, the government awarded him a small grant of &pound;150. He died at Mill Gate Hall, Stockport, on 20 May 1842 and was buried in Mellor churchyard on 24 May. Ten children predeceased him; he was survived by four sons and three daughters.<br>
