<span class="headword">Bowman,  Henry</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1674&#150;1680), <span class="occ">composer and music copyist</span>, is of unknown parentage, but he may have been related to the booksellers Francis and Thomas Bowman, of St Mary the Virgin parish, Oxford. The earliest reference to &#145;Mr Bowman&#146; is dated 5 February 1674, when his &#145;new Ayres&#146; were first performed at the Oxford music school  (Bodl. Oxf., MSS mus. sch. D.241&#150;244).<br>
<br>Probably during the 1670s Bowman copied a number of manuscripts mainly devoted to the Italian and English vocal music then popular in Oxford. The manuscripts Christ Church Mus. 623&#150;626 contain anthems by Edward Lowe, professor of music at Oxford, while BL, Add. MS 30382 is an early source of two vocal duets by Purcell. Several of Bowman's own vocal compositions, which reflect the influence of the Italian works he transcribed, also appear in the latter manuscript. Some loose autograph papers, now bound in Bodl. Oxf., MSS mus. sch. C.203 and C.204, were performing material for the music school, and other works in the same collection, including the ayres in D.241&#150;244, were copied by Lowe, in some cases in collaboration with Bowman.<br>
<br>In 1677 Bowman's <span class="italic">Songs for One, Two and Three Voices</span> was published at Oxford, engraved in a style modelled on his distinctive musical handwriting. All copies seem to have been produced with a decorative engraved title-page giving only the composer's name and a short title; some also have a printed title-page, dated 1678, identifying Thomas Bowman as publisher. Copies without this extra page also lack the imprimatur of 12 June 1677 and are assumed to have been issued in that year. A second, corrected, edition was published by Richard Davis in 1679, and a further impression was advertised in 1683. Bowman's songs are notable for the quality of their verses by Abraham Cowley and other poets; the high standard of their engraving, at a time when most London music prints used the Granjon moveable typeface; and their inclusion of some symphony songs possibly earlier than any works in this genre by Blow or Purcell.<br>
<br>The printed title-pages of <span class="italic">Songs</span> describe Bowman as &#145;Philo-Musicus&#146;, which may indicate that he was not a professional musician. There is no record of his having held an official post in Oxford, but he appears to have had a close relationship with Lowe and to have contributed significantly to Oxford's late seventeenth-century flowering as an independent musical centre with a tendency to cultivate its own musicians and a local if limited tradition of music publication. He is last mentioned in Lowe's comment that Bowman's act song &#145;My Lesbia, let us live and love&#146; was composed for Saturday 10 July 1680 but not performed  (Bodl. Oxf., MS mus. sch. C.120).<br>
