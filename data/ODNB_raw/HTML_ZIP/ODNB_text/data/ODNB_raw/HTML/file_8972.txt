<span class="headword">Evans,  Lewis</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1565&#150;1571), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was of unknown parentage and bore a name common in the Elizabethan church, especially at the University of Oxford. Anthony Wood listed him as an Oxonian, but gloomily mentioned half a dozen namesakes and confessed, &#145;I cannot tell&#146; which of them was the writer  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.411). Others have favoured <a name="cosubject_77314"></a><span class="headword">Lewis Evans</span>  (<em>b. </em>1532/3, <em>d.</em> in or after 1576), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the Flintshire man elected student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1552 at the age of nineteen, though Wood argued that the author, who mentioned no degrees on his title-pages, was from either Oxfordshire or Monmouthshire but not a graduate. Compared with others, Evans &#145;can hardly be regarded as a serious controversialist&#146;, and there is no certainty that he had the education implied in the Christ Church identification  (Southern, 116).<br>
<br>About the time of the Council of Trent's definite prohibition in 1564 of &#145;church papistry&#146; (Roman Catholic attendance at Church of England services), Evans seems to have abandoned his initial conformity to the Elizabethan settlement. He must have gone to the diocese of London, for in 1565 he recalled being before the bishop, Edmund Grindal, at Fulham Palace &#145;sundrie times for religion&#146;&#151;&#145;I founde at youre handes a certayne kinde of favour&#146;  (Evans, <span class="italic">Certaine Tables</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>). By 1565 he had withdrawn to the Catholic printing centre of Antwerp, where he published Willem van der Lindt's <span class="italic">Certaine tables &hellip; translated into Englishe by Lewys Evans and by hym intituled the betraying of the beastlines of heretykes</span> and also <span class="italic">A Brieve Admonition unto the Nowe Made Ministers of England</span> (signed by him at Louvain). Evans insisted that Catholics' political loyalty exceeded that of their protestant critics, and exhibited a particular interest in the sexual misconduct of protestant clergy. In this latter preoccupation he exceeded co-religionists such as Thomas Harding and John Rastell. He did not engage directly with Church of England opponents such as John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, nor they with him, though James Calfhill noted that he could have said worse things about Catholics' morality &#145;if I had Lewis Evans his vein&#146;  (Calfhill, 331).<br>
<br>By 1568 Evans was back in England, was imprisoned briefly, and published a protestant tract, <span class="italic">The Castle of Christianitie, Detecting the Long Erring Estate &hellip; of the Romaine Church</span>. The title-page quoted <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>: &#145;Be not ashamed to confesse thine errour, for he that is wise will remember himselfe.&#146; The dedication to Elizabeth I thanked her for overlooking his drinking &#145;of the puddell of ignorancy, of the mudde of idolatrie, of the ponde of superstition&#146;  (Evans, <span class="italic">Castle</span>, sig. D<i>v</i>). He espoused patriotism, continuing in <span class="italic">A Short Treatise of the Mistery of the Eucharist</span> (1569) that Catholics should &#145;understande where they were brought up &hellip; They knowe what I meane, and they be not ignorante what I doe know&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>). The northern rising provided the occasion for <span class="italic">The Hatefull Hypocrisie and Rebellion of the Romish Prelacie</span> (1570), which he began by refuting rumours that he had heard in &#145;the university of Oxforde&#146; and London &#145;that I had revolted from the gospell, and &hellip; agayne gonne beyonde the seas &hellip; that I was deade&#146;  (Evans, <span class="italic">Hatefull Hypocrisie</span>, &#145;To the reader&#146;, sig. A4<i>r</i>). It, and <span class="italic">The Castle of Christianitie</span>, continued his favoured accusations of disloyalty and incontinence, merely reversing the direction of his arguments from those he had made in 1565. In summer 1571 he was at Denbigh&#151;he told Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, that he was seizing for the bishop of Bangor, Nicholas Robinson, &#145;sediciouse and trayterouse&#146; prophecies. Moreover, &#145;there came hyther of late a Welshe booke wrytten by some of Rome &hellip; At the busshop's request I translated yt into English, and soe doe aunswere yt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 5.182). This was Morys Clynnog's catechism, to which Evans published his <span class="italic">Brief Answer</span> that year.<br>
<br>The career of the Lewis Evans who was at Christ Church is clearer, but accords in some respects with the details of the life of the controversialist as they are known. He had Thomas Francis, later regius professor of physic, as tutor. Having entered under Edward VI's religious dispensation, he weathered later changes to graduate BA on 1 February 1554, proceeding MA in July 1557 and BD in February 1562. He was ordained subdeacon at Oxford in December 1557. Probably he was the MA presented in November 1561 to the rectory of Waterstock, Oxfordshire, by Elizabeth, widow of Sir Thomas Cave. He left Christ Church some time between Michaelmas 1562 and Michaelmas 1563, conceivably for Waterstock&#151;but this would also be a plausible time for a reversion to Catholicism. An argument against the controversialist's being Evans of Christ Church is that the latter seems to have retained Waterstock&#151;although it might have been sequestrated&#151;and was given dispensations to hold pluralities with it by Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, in May 1566 and by the faculty office in May 1567. This allowed him to become rector of Westwell in Oxfordshire, a Christ Church living, worth under &pound;8 per annum. As Waterstock was worth &pound;10 16<i>s</i>. per annum, his circumstances were still not lavish, but he also held a third Oxfordshire rectory, Ducklington, worth &pound;24 10 <i>s</i>. per annum. He resigned Westwell by October 1574 and was replaced at Waterstock in May 1576, apparently being deprived and certainly departing rather than dying. Later references are probably to namesakes, especially the graduate of Oriel College, Oxford, who died in 1585, and has been identified as canon of Wells in 1566, MA in 1570, and chaplain to Ferdinando Stanley, Baron Strange, in 1576.<br>
<br>Wood believed the controversialist Evans became a schoolmaster, which tends to identify him with the editor of John Withal's <span class="italic">Shorte Dictionarie</span> (1574)&#151;published with a dedication to Leicester&#151;and possibly also with the author of <span class="italic">Abridgement of Logique</span> (1568). The dedication of the latter to Grindal, who is thanked for &#145;clemencie&#146; towards the author, might recall that of <span class="italic">Certaine Tables</span>, but the book's classical interests have little in common with those of the religious polemics and more with that of a fragmentary translation of Horace by &#145;Lewis Evans scholemayster&#146;, whose date of 1565 makes it unlikely that he was the controversialist  (sig. A7<i>v</i>). Ultimately the controversialist's career is obscure except for the information he gives about himself&#151;the Christ Church identification is tempting but unproven. Evans the controversialist was remembered for self-contradiction; although he was listed in or before 1588 as both &#145;papist&#146; and protestant divine, it is confirmed that he was then dead  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 13.394).<br>
