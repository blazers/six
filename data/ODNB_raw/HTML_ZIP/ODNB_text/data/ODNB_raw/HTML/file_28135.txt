<span class="headword">Vaughan,  John</span>, third earl of Carbery  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1713), <span class="occ">politician and colonial governor</span>, was baptized on 18 July 1639 at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28140/', "Richard Vaughan, second earl of Carbery (1600?&#150;1686)")</script>, and his second wife, Frances (1620/1621&#150;1650), daughter and coheir of Sir James Altham of Oxhey in Watford, Hertfordshire. He was educated at home at Golden Grove, Llanfihangel Aberbythych, Carmarthenshire, by Dr Jeremy Taylor, who was chaplain to the family under the second earl's protection during the protectorate. Despite being royalists, the Carberys benefited from the personal favour of Cromwell, who admired Frances Vaughan's piety. Vaughan matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1656 and proceeded to the Inner Temple in 1658. He was knighted at Charles II's coronation in 1661 and became MP for the borough of Carmarthen in the same year. In parliament Vaughan was a fierce promoter of the king's personal interests, especially those involving providing money for Charles. He opposed Lord Chancellor Clarendon's austerity measures, and played a role in Clarendon's impeachment in 1667. Vaughan's activities caused Pepys to declare him &#145;one of the lewdest fellows of the age, worse than Sir Charles Sedley&#146;, and Clarendon described him as having &#145;as ill a face as fame&#146;  (Pepys, 8.532 and n). Vaughan enjoyed life in Restoration London to the fullest. He was fond of the theatre and especially of the plays of John Dryden for whom he wrote a poetic prologue to <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span>. He became his father's heir in 1667 upon his elder brother's death and claimed the courtesy title Lord Vaughan. He married Mary Brown, of Green Castle, Carmarthen, a couple of years before her death in 1674; they had no children.<br>
<br>Vaughan was appointed governor of Jamaica in 1674. He intended to run Jamaica's government with the English parliament as a model. His instructions for running the island from the king and the lords of trade and plantations included stopping piracy, encouraging planting of sugar, and negotiating prices of slaves with the Royal African Company. Once he arrived in the colony, he was in constant conflict with his lieutenant-governor, the ex-buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan, and with the Jamaican assembly, which opposed his tough measures against pirates. In piracy cases the accused were often supported by Morgan as they were prosecuted by Vaughan. Vaughan made piracy an executable offence in 1677 when the Jamaican assembly was given the right to issue death sentences without appeal. None of the laws passed by the Jamaican assembly under Vaughan were given the royal assent, but his leadership marks the start of the constitutional history of the island. He corresponded with Henry Oldenburg, secretary to the Royal Society, while on Jamaica, and thereby kept up with all the latest scientific developments in London. An element of scandal followed Vaughan throughout his life from his time in Jamaica; he was accused by his enemies of selling his Welsh servants, including his clergyman, into slavery on the island. Vaughan was an unpopular governor, and the assembly failed to vote him an income for his last year on the island. He suffered from ill health in the tropical climate and was no doubt happy to return to London in 1678.<br>
<br>Vaughan regained his place in parliament as MP for the county of Carmarthen (1679&#150;81, 1685&#150;6). Despite his dubious reputation his life and career flourished after his return from Jamaica. His friend Dryden dedicated his coarsest comedy, <span class="italic">The Kind Keeper, or, Mr Limberham</span>, to Vaughan in 1680. The play was forced to close after only three days, even in the relaxed moral world of Restoration London, though Dryden had been initially confident that his learned and witty patron would protect the play, which had first been performed when Vaughan was away in Jamaica. Vaughan married Lady Anne Savile (1663&#150;1690), daughter of George Savile, first marquess of Halifax, in 1682. With her he had his only surviving legitimate child and heir, Anne, before his wife died in childbirth in 1690. On the death of his father in December 1686 Vaughan became third earl of Carbery and also inherited the baronies of Mullengar and Emlyn. His wide learning and love of mathematics were acknowledged when he became president of the Royal Society in 1686; he held the position for three years. He supported the accession of William and Mary in 1688 and remained a member of the whig establishment until his death. He built a house at Tite Street, Chelsea, subsequently called Gough House after a later owner, which was his chief London residence. The earl was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script>, and his portrait was painted by Kneller as one of the famous collection commemorating the club. It is now on display at Beningbrough Hall. Carbery died suddenly on 16 January 1713 while returning to Chelsea after visiting his banker in London. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 28 January in St John the Baptist's chapel. His titles died with him, and his daughter inherited the wealth he carefully accumulated throughout his life. She married, almost immediately after her father's death, Charles Powlett. The marriage was unhappy, and she died without children in 1751. Carbery's house at Chelsea was demolished in 1966.<br>
