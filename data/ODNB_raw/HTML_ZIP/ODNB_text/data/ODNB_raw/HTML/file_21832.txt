<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Penderel,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">royalist sympathizer</span>, was the third son of William Penderel (<i>d</i>. in or before 1651) and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. after 1662), of Hobbal Grange in Tong, Shropshire, where Richard was born. The family were Catholic and rented a &#145;little farm&#146;  (Broadley, 118) from another Catholic, Basil Fitzherbert of nearby Boscobel House. Richard was described by Thomas Blount as &#145;of honest parentage, but mean degree&#146;  (Blount, 40), while Father John Huddleston referred to him as a humble woodcutter and &#145;labouring&#146; man  (Matthews, 113). In an interview with Charles II in early June 1660 Richard allegedly called himself a &#145;raw and undisciplined rustic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antiquarian Repertory</span>, 1780, 2.59). But, although illiterate, he was in fact of yeoman status, as appears by a letter of attorney which he authorized on 24 June 1663. By the time of Charles II's escape after the battle of Worcester in 1651 he had succeeded his father to the life tenancy of the Hobbal Grange property and it was from there that he was summoned to attend the king when the latter arrived at nearby White Ladies Priory in the small hours of 4 September 1651. The hapless monarch was placed under his care and protection. Penderel's first task was to disguise the king as &#145;William Jones&#146;, &#145;a la mode the woodman&#146;  (Fea, <span class="italic">Flight</span>, 1897, 204); this he did by cutting the king's hair &#145;with a pair of shears&#146; and dressing him in a suit of his own clothes comprising &#145;a doe-skin leather doublet&#146; and a pair of breeches made of &#145;green course cloth&#146;  (Matthews, 88). Fortunately for the king, Richard was a tall man like himself and thus his modest attire was a perfect fit. Richard next hid the king in an adjacent wood called Spring coppice and attended to his physical comforts as best he could, in the pouring rain, for the rest of the day, while maintaining a vigilant watch for the enemy. In the evening Penderel took the king to the family farm where his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1689), prepared supper while Charles held the couple's daughter, Nan, on his knee. From here the king and Penderel set out on foot for Wales. They had an unpleasant encounter at Evelith Mill when the angry occupant accosted them and gave chase as they fled down a muddy country lane, Charles being forced to listen to &#145;the rusling of Penderel's leathern Breeches&#146;  (Broadley, 122) to retain his sense of direction. By dawn the two men had reached Madeley and the king was not &#145;a little troubled&#146; when Richard &#145;very indiscreetly and without any leave&#146; aroused the household of Francis Wolfe and sought his protection  (Matthews, 46). The king need not have feared, since Penderel knew Wolfe to be &#145;an honest man&#146;  (ibid., 44) from his previous acquaintance with him as a fellow Catholic. After hiding with the king in Wolfe's barn all next day, and discovering that the passage over the River Severn was blocked by Cromwell's troops, Penderel and his royal companion returned to Hobbal Grange early in the morning of Saturday 5 September, Charles at one point helping him over a stream because he could not swim. Charles immediately went on to Boscobel and the following Sunday Penderel served as one of Charles's bodyguard during the famous nocturnal journey from Boscobel House to Moseley Hall, near Wolverhampton.<br>
<br>Though much threatened by &#145;a peevish neighbour&#146;  (Blount, 42), who suspected his complicity in Charles's getaway, Penderel escaped detection until the Restoration, when he came into his own. &#145;Friend Richard&#146; was warmly welcomed at court in June 1660 when the king urged all about him to &#145;respect this good man for my sake&#146;  (F. Grose, <span class="italic">Antiquarian Repertory</span>, 2.59). On 12 April 1662 Charles awarded Penderel &pound;200 &#145;to enable him to live in the quality of a farmer&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 338), as well as subsequently settling upon him and his heirs forever an annual pension of &pound;100. Penderel continued to live at Hobbal Grange but made regular visits to London to see the king and it was there, on 7 February 1672, while staying in the house of Henry Arundel in the Great Turnstile in Lincoln's Inn Fields that he died of a fever. In his will, dated the same day, he proudly refers to himself as a &#145;gentleman&#146; and was now clearly a man of substance, bequeathing his eldest son, Thomas, a newly built house at Statherton in Shropshire, an annuity to another son, Simon, and a tenement in Russell Street, Walsall, to a third, William. He was buried on 11 February in the churchyard of St Giles-in-the-Fields where his grave was marked by a special tomb-chest, reputedly commissioned by the king, which praised him as &#145;Unparalled Penderel&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 1st ser., 11, 1855, 410). A portrait by Zoust depicts him as stockily built, with chubby cheeks, prominent nose, and long, flowing hair. He looks every inch &#145;an honest man&#146;  (Broadley, 60), and his likeness more than explains why his contemporaries dubbed him Trusty Dick  (Matthews, 114).<br>
<br>Richard Penderel's four brothers were also instrumental in Charles II's escape. The eldest brother, <a name="cosubject_77033"></a><span class="headword">William Penderel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1609&#150;1700)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Hobbal Grange and was living with his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1669), a sister of William Cope, husbandman of Tong, at Chillington in the neighbouring parish of Brewood, in 1641 when they were both indicted for recusancy. He was then described as a yeoman. By 1651 he was the caretaker of Boscobel House and on 29 August 1651 offered sanctuary to the royalist earl of Derby after his disastrous defeat at Wigan in Lancashire. Six days later he met the fugitive king in the inner parlour of White Ladies Priory and &#145;promised to do his utmost&#146;  (Broadley, 118) to assist him, a pledge he amply fulfilled on 6 and 7 September.<br>
<br>During the first day of the king's stay at Boscobel William and his wife furnished the wood ladder to enable Charles to climb into the boughs of the royal oak as well as providing two pillows for him to rest on, to say nothing of their diversionary tactic of &#145;peaking up and down&#146;  (Matthews, 92) in the adjoining wood to deflect the attention of the parliamentary cavalry, who were then combing the entire area. That evening and the following day the couple were equally solicitous about the king's welfare, plying him with food as well as ministering to his blistered feet and bleeding nose, hospitality which put Charles in a &#145;good humour&#146; and prompted him to address William's spouse as &#145;My Dame Joan&#146;  (Blount, 39). After the king's departure husband and wife suffered considerable molestation, William being twice interrogated at Shrewsbury while Joan was &#145;much affrighted&#146;  (ibid., 39) by the frequent searches of Boscobel House.<br>
<br>Both William and his wife lived to see the Restoration. Joan died in 1669 and was interred in the graveyard of White Ladies Priory, while William continued to live at Boscobel. He was an extremely enterprising man, turning Boscobel into a tourist attraction and converting part of the house into an inn named, appropriately enough, the Royal Oak. He was also a recipient of the royal bounty, having a regular pension of &pound;100 a year and other gifts of money. In his later years he was persecuted for his Catholicism, particularly during the Popish Plot, though he did receive the royal protection in January 1679. Like his brother Richard, William was a tall man; an engraving of him at the age of eighty-four suggests that he had an elongated face with a moustache and goatee beard. He died at Boscobel in August 1700.<br>
<br>According to Father Huddleston, the second eldest brother, <a name="cosubject_77034"></a><span class="headword">John Penderel</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1683)<span class="occ"></span>, &#145;tooke the most pains of all the brothers&#146;  (Matthews, 113). During the civil war he fought for Charles I as a common soldier and probably served under Colonel William Careless in the royalist garrison at Tong Castle in his native parish. When Charles II took refuge at White Ladies on 4 September he was then living in the house, &#145;a kinde of woodward there&#146;  (ibid.). He was initially delegated the task of conveying the king's companion, Henry, Lord Wilmot, towards London; and after many narrow escapes finally left him with Thomas Whitgreave of Moseley Hall. He then trudged on foot back and forth between Moseley and White Ladies bearing messages from Wilmot to the king, who used him on 6 September to inform Squire Whitgreave of his intention to seek protection at Moseley. Along with his other four brothers, all armed, he escorted Charles at dead of night from Boscobel to his new sanctuary, and remained with him for the next few days serving as a royal messenger. At the Restoration he received an annuity of &pound;100 and a number of other payments from the crown in recognition of his services. By the late 1660s he had migrated to Albrighton in Shropshire following his marriage to Jane Southall of Beamish Hall in that parish. At this time his social rank is given as that of a husbandman, suggesting that he did not prosper as well as the other Penderel brothers from the king's largess, and significantly he left debts in excess of &pound;100 at his death about 1683.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77035"></a><span class="headword">Humphrey Penderel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1687/8)<span class="occ"></span>, the fourth brother, was a miller at the time of the king's flight, running the mill next to White Ladies Priory. During Charles's concealment in Spring coppice on 4 September he acted as a scout and that evening at Hobbal Grange offered to reconnoitre in advance the king's route to Madeley, but his services were declined. On 6 September, while the king was hiding in the royal oak, he was sent to Shifnal to gather intelligence about the enemy troop movements, and there he was closely interrogated by a Cromwellian colonel who threatened him with dire punishment if he withheld information and promised a &pound;1000 reward should he give it. But Humphrey &#145;pleaded ignorance and was dismissed&#146;  (Blount, 29). Unfortunately, on his return to Boscobel he rather tactlessly informed Charles of these proceedings, causing him some anxiety, and it took all of Humphrey's &#145;urgent asservations&#146;  (ibid.) to set the king's mind at rest. It was during the famous night march from Boscobel to Moseley, however, that Humphrey Penderel made his most notable contribution to the royal escape. He provided his old mill horse for Charles to ride on, prompting the king to quip &#145;It was the heaviest dull jade&#146; he had ever encountered, to which Humphrey supposedly replied &#145;Can you blame the horse &hellip; when he hath the weight of three kingdomes upon his back?&#146;  (Broadley, 67). This witty riposte is often regarded as apocryphal, but Penderel himself confirmed that he made it in a petition to Charles II in January 1673.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Penderel was rewarded with a pension, though his annuity of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. was less than the &pound;100 assigned to his brothers. In May 1668 he was living at Little Bloxwich in Staffordshire and had now become a yeoman. He and his wife, Eleanor, had at least four children, which proved such a &#145;great charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1672&#150;3</i>, 496&#150;7) that he was obliged to appeal to the king for a gift of &pound;200 to satisfy his creditors. Charles not only furnished the money but secured Humphrey's son Edmund the position of footman to his wife, Queen Catherine. Humphrey died in 1687 or 1688 with a reputation for being a man of &#145;solid honesty&#146; and &#145;resolved loyalty&#146;  (Broadley, 63).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77036"></a><span class="headword">George Penderel</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1684)<span class="occ"></span> was the youngest of the five brothers. He too fought for Charles I in the first civil war and in 1651 was serving as a domestic in the White Ladies' household. He was the first man to welcome Charles at White Ladies on 4 September and spent most of that day in reconnaissance around Tong and Spring coppice to ensure that the king's pursuers remained at bay. He also shared a meal with the king and accompanied him to Hobbal Grange. His final assistance to the royal refugee was to guard him during the evening ride to Moseley. After the Restoration George settled at Hednesford in Staffordshire and thanks to royal favour rose in status, being described as a yeoman in May 1668 and a gentleman in February 1671. Such was his improved standing that he was appointed one of the three overseers of the poor in the parish of Cannock in 1670. During the Popish Plot hysteria he was regularly indicted for recusancy and had to be protected by the king, who exempted him from prosecution in January 1679. He married and had several children, and had died by June 1684. To the very end the king retained &#145;a gracious sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1684&#150;5</i>, 77) of his indebtedness to George and the rest of &#145;the five loyall and faithfull brothers&#146;  (Broadley, 101).<br>
