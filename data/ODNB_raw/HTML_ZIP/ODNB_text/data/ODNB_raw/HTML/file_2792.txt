<span class="headword">Boldero,  Edmund</span>  (1609&#150;1679), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the seventh of the eleven children of John Boldero and his wife, Mary, daughter of Raygnall Tillot of Rougham. He was educated at Ipswich School and at Cambridge University, where he matriculated from Pembroke College in 1626, graduated BA in 1629, was awarded a fellowship on 4 February 1631, and proceeded MA in 1632. He became a curate of St Lawrence, Ipswich, and rector of Westerfield, Suffolk, in 1643.<br>
<br>During the civil war Boldero strove to defend the established church. Besides challenging William Dowsing's iconoclasm in Pembroke College chapel (unsuccessfully), he co-authored with John Barwick, Peter Gunning, William Lacy, Isaac Barrow, Seth Ward, and William Quarles a tract against the solemn league and covenant, <span class="italic">Certain Disquisitions and Considerations Representing to the Conscience</span> (1644). He was ejected from his fellowship in 1644. John Walker, in the <span class="italic">Sufferings of the Clergy</span> (1714), claimed that Boldero was sent in captivity to London, where he was &#145;detained under a long and chargeable confinement&#146;  (p. 162). The committee for plundered ministers sequestered him, as rector of Westerfield, for drunkenness on 1 July 1647. He was also charged from St Lawrence, at an unspecified date, with scandalous living and doctrinal misdemeanours which consisted of administering the sacrament only at the rails and obliterating from the church wall the final clause of <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 3: 17, which specified the temple of God to be situated in people, rather than buildings.<br>
<br>According to Boldero's later claim, he then became a chaplain in Scotland under the marquess of Montrose and subsequently &#145;was released from prison only by banishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 117). Roger North, whose brother was a colleague of Boldero's in the 1660s, suggested that &#145;between the ladder and the rope, [Boldero] had narrowly escaped hanging&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lives of &hellip; the Norths</span>, 1826, 3.278&#150;9).<br>
<br>In 1661 Boldero was created DD at Cambridge by royal mandate. He was restored to Westerfield in 1662. Bishop Wren of Ely, to whom he was chaplain, presented him to the Suffolk rectories of Glemsford, on 15 February 1662, and of Harkstead. He was successfully nominated by Wren master of Jesus College, Cambridge, and admitted on 27 May 1663; he left Harkstead when Wren also presented him to the rectory of Snailwell, Cambridgeshire, on 13 July 1663. Life at Jesus under Boldero was generally undistinguished, but he seems to have transformed the college library. He was vice-chancellor of the university in 1668 and 1674. Boldero died at Cambridge on 5 July 1679, and was buried in Jesus College chapel. Most of his goods were bequeathed to his niece Jane Colman and his kinsman Daniel Boldero, and all his books went to Jesus Library.<br>
