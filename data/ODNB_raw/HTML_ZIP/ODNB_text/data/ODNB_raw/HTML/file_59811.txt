<span class="headword">Peterson,  Alexander Duncan Campbell</span>  (1908&#150;1988), <span class="occ">educational reformer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 13 September 1908, the third of five sons, but the second to survive childhood (there were no daughters), of John Carlos Kennedy Peterson (1876&#150;1955), of the Indian Civil Service, under-secretary in the finance department, government of Bengal, and his wife, Flora Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1953). One of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66866/', "Sir Arthur William Peterson")</script>. He and his brothers were brought up largely by aunts and uncles. His parents had no home leave between 1915 and 1919, and when his mother eventually arrived at his preparatory school he failed to recognize her. He won scholarships to Radley College and to Balliol College, Oxford, liking the second as much as he had disliked the first. At Oxford he showed the breadth of interest and taste for experiment which marked him throughout life. His activities as an undergraduate were multifarious, and in 1930 he missed a first in <i>literae humaniores</i>, apparently by a very narrow margin. He had received a second class in classical honour moderations in 1928.<br>
<br>Peterson's flair for communication did not stay hidden for long. His ascent up the teacher's ladder (as assistant master, Shrewsbury School, 1932&#150;40; and as headmaster of Adams' Grammar School, Newport, 1946&#150;52, and of Dover College, 1954&#150;7) was punctuated by two periods of psychological warfare in the Far East. The first (1943&#150;5), under Lord Louis Mountbatten, earned him an OBE (1946); during the second (1952&#150;4), under Sir Gerald Templer in Malaya, his formidable chief judged him &#145;absolutely first class&#146;.<br>
<br>The directorship of Oxford University's department of education, which Peterson held from 1958 until his retirement in 1973, left him time for writing on educational problems and for outside activities. As the chairman of the Farmington Trust's council from 1964 to 1971 he helped to found the <span class="italic">Journal of Moral Education</span>. He acted for a time as the Liberal Party's spokesman on education, and stood without any chance of success for Oxford in the 1966 election. He served from 1959 to 1966 as chairman of the Army Education Advisory Board. It was, however, as the advocate of broader sixth form studies that he became well known. He opened the campaign with a broadcast early in 1956  (<span class="italic">Listener</span>, 16 February), continued it in his Estlin Carpenter lectures at Oxford in 1957 (published as <span class="italic">Educating our Rulers</span>, 1957), and brought it to a remarkable climax with the Oxford department's report, &#145;Arts and science sides in the sixth form&#146;, in 1960. This established beyond reasonable doubt that the early specialization characterizing English secondary schools not merely precluded sixth form courses appropriate to a scientific age, but reduced the flow of science graduates. About 40 per cent of the English sixteen-year-olds questioned for the report would have liked to combine arts with mathematics or science: under 6 per cent were actually doing so. When more than 700 pupils in French <i>lyc&eacute;es</i> and German <i>Gymnasia</i> were asked what subjects they would have chosen for the <i>baccalaur&eacute;at</i> or <i>Abitur</i> had there been no restrictions on choice, only five chose entirely from mathematics or science. Peterson had won the argument; but, like many others in the decades which followed, he found that this did not open the road to the needed reforms.<br>
<br>Frustrated in England, Peterson turned abroad. The international sixth form which he had started at Dover brought him into contact with Kurt Hahn, and in 1962, when Atlantic College was founded, he helped to plan its curriculum. No single syllabus could be made to conform to university entrance requirements, which varied from country to country; and in the same year plans for an international baccalaureate were being discussed in Geneva. The Oxford department, which was then embarking on an investigation for the Council of Europe, was soon involved in the planning for this; and Peterson was the director of the International Baccalaureate Office during the crucial phase of growth, from 1966 to 1977. In the year of his death an international baccalaureate, based on a balanced curriculum of six subjects, was in use in fifty-six countries and 2643 diplomas were awarded. Eleven years later this figure had grown to 13,089, and the system had been extended to include younger pupils, the total entry for the diplomas and certificates being 38,129. The United World Colleges, headed by Atlantic College, needed the international baccalaureate and nourished it. Peterson, who was chairman of the United World Colleges (1978&#150;80), helped with both organizations until he died. In <span class="italic">Schools across Frontiers</span> (1987) he recorded the struggle to establish them. He was made an honorary doctor of the University of Trieste (1985).<br>
<br>Peterson was tall and good looking. In December 1939 he married Ruth Pauline, daughter of William Anderson Armstrong, solicitor. This marriage ended in divorce in 1946, and in the same year he married Corinna May, daughter of Sir Arthur William Steuart Cochrane, Clarenceux king of arms. There were two sons and a daughter of the second marriage. Peterson, who lived latterly at 107A Hamilton Terrace, London, died of a heart attack in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 17 October 1988. He was survived by his wife.<br>
