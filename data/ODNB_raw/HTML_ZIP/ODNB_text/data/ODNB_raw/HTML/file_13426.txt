<span class="headword">Hodges, Sir  William</span>  (1808&#150;1868), <span class="occ">legal writer and judge</span>, eldest son of William Hodges of Weymouth, and Sarah, second daughter of William Isaac of Weymouth, was born at Melcombe Regis, Dorset, on 29 September 1808, and educated at a private school at Salisbury and at the University of London. Lectured by John Austin (1790&#150;1859) and Andrew Amos (1791&#150;1860) on jurisprudence and law, he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 3 May 1833. He married in 1835 Mary Schollar, daughter of James Sanders of Weymouth, and they had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Hodges went the western circuit, and in 1835 he began to report cases in the court of common pleas (published 1835&#150;7), presided over by Sir Nicholas Tindal, who in 1837 appointed him revising barrister for Devon and Cornwall. In 1838 he began to report in the queen's bench. In 1839 he published <span class="italic">Report of the case of the Queen v. Lumsdaine, with observations on the Parochial Assessment Act</span> and, in 1840, jointly with Graham Willmore and F. L. Wollaston, <span class="italic">Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Court of Queen's Bench &hellip; Hilary Term to Michaelmas Term, 1838</span>. In 1842 he published a small treatise entitled <span class="italic">The Law Relating to the Assessment of Railways</span> and, in 1845, <span class="italic">The Statute Law Relating to Railways in England and Ireland</span>. In 1846 he was appointed recorder of Poole, Dorset. <span class="italic">The Law Relating to Railways and Railway Companies</span>, which he published in 1847, reached a seventh edition, edited by J. M. Lely, in 1888, and became a standard work on the subject. He also drafted the <span class="roman">Public Health Act</span> of 1848, and acquired some parliamentary and general practice at Westminster.<br>
<br>In 1857 Hodges was appointed to the chief justiceship of the supreme court of the Cape of Good Hope, and to the presidency of the legislative council and of the court of admiralty. He was made KCMG in 1858. He discharged his official duties with energy and efficiency until his death at his residence, Sea Point House, Cape Town, on 17 August 1868. He was honoured with a public funeral.<br>
