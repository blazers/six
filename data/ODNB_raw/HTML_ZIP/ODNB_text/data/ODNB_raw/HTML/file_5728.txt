<span class="headword">Coates,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> 1813), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was baptized in St Laurence's Church, Reading, on 27 March 1746, the son of John Coates, watchmaker in the City of London, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was educated at Reading School for a record nine years, under the Revd John Spicer, being admitted as a sizar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, at the age of sixteen in May 1762; he became a scholar that same year. He obtained the degree of bachelor of medicine five years later.<br>
<br>Having chosen the church as his profession, Coates was ordained deacon at Salisbury in 1770 and priest a year later in London. After a curacy at Ealing, under the Revd Charles Sturges, in 1780 he was presented to the living of Preston, Dorset, with the help of John Spicer, then the prebendary there. In 1788 the bishop of Salisbury permitted him to take the nearby living of Osmington, and he received a Lambeth LLB.<br>
<br>In 1791 Coates issued proposals for a work on <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Reading</span>, and embarked on some intensive research. He studied the relevant manuscripts in the British Museum and the Bodleian Library and the records at the Tower of London, the rolls and augmentation offices, and those with the corporation of Reading. The 500-page quarto volume, handsomely illustrated, did not appear until 1802, when the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> commented ironically that &#145;those subscribers, who have been so lucky as to live long enough to reap the benefit of their subscription-money, have very sufficient reason to be satisfied with the work&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 72/2, 1802, 620). In 1810 he published <span class="italic">A Supplement &hellip; with Corrections and Additions by the Author</span>. His history gives an unrivalled portrayal of the town, as well as its memorials and remains, at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Unfortunately it has no index. Coates was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1793. Having been appointed chaplain to the prince of Wales, he dedicated the history to him. In 1808 he was made prebendary of Wells.<br>
<br>Coates had many friendships in Reading. He was the benefactor of Mrs Ann Latournelle, the needy widow of a nonconformist minister, until her death in 1780. Although he would have welcomed preferment, or one of the Reading parishes that were in the gift of the crown, he never left Dorset. His later decades were clouded by his wife's chronic ill health, and it brought on a severe paralytic attack, which ended his literary career. He had been working on a new and enlarged edition of Elias Ashmole's <span class="italic">History of Berkshire</span>, which he did not complete. He had also collected documents for a continuation of John Le Neve's <span class="italic">Lives of the Protestant Archbishops</span>; these he presented to Alexander Chalmers for insertion in a new edition of the <span class="italic">General Biographical Dictionary</span>.<br>
<br>Mrs Coates died on 27 November 1812, leaving no children. The <span class="italic">Reading Mercury</span> published a tribute to her by him. However, it did not record Coates's own death at Osmington four months later, on 7 April 1813.<br>
