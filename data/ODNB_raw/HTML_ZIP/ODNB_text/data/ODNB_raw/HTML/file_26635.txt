<span class="headword">Strange, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1696, <em>d.</em> 1754), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, on 8 September 1696, the eldest son of John Strange of Fleet Street, London, and his second wife, Mary Plaistowe. He was admitted a student at the Middle Temple on 11 July 1712, and later commenced pupillage in the busy practice of Charles Salkeld, a solicitor of Brook Street, Holborn, where Thomas Parker (later chief baron of the exchequer), Philip Yorke (later Lord Chancellor Hardwicke), and Robert Jocelyn (later lord chancellor of Ireland) had all trained. One of his tasks was to carry his master's papers to Westminster Hall, and in 1717 he witnessed Sir Joseph Jekyll's first appearance as master of the rolls, hardly suspecting that twenty years later he himself would be invited to succeed Jekyll in the office.<br>
<br>At this early stage in his career Strange was already beginning to compile notes and transcripts of various cases in the Westminster courts which were to form the basis of his posthumously published <span class="italic">Reports</span>. On 27 October 1718 he was called to the bar, and by 1722 was appearing as junior counsel for the crown. At St Bride's on 14 May 1722 he married Susan (1700/01&#150;1747), daughter and coheir of Edward Strong of Greenwich, and a large family of two sons and nine daughters (two daughters dying young) followed. His second son was the natural philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26636/', "John Strange")</script>. In 1725 he was employed as defence counsel in the impeachment of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, but though he maintained a commendable reputation at the bar it was not until 9 February 1736 that he became a king's counsel and thus marked out for future advancement. In the same year the Middle Temple elected him a bencher.<br>
<br>On 28 January 1737 Strange was appointed to Sir Robert Walpole's ministry as solicitor-general, and less than a fortnight later was brought into parliament for West Looe, Cornwall. As one of the crown's chief law officers in the Commons he was soon drawn into important work in assisting the government's bill against the provost and city of Edinburgh following the murder of Captain Porteous the previous year, and on 9 June he gave a lengthy summary to the house of the evidence against the provost. On the death of the master of the rolls, Sir Joseph Jekyll, on 19 August 1738, he was immediately invited to succeed by his old friend from student days Philip Yorke, now Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. Strange reluctantly declined, protesting his lack of experience in chancery jurisdiction but also expressing concern that the profits might be insufficient to support his large family. In November 1739 he was elected recorder of London by the court of aldermen, and on 12 May 1740 was knighted at Whitehall with his senior colleague Dudley Ryder, the attorney-general. He stood down at West Looe in the election of May 1741, but in January 1742 was returned at a by-election for Totnes, Devon, and continued to sit for the borough until his death. At the end of March 1742 he was one of the small handful of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93705', "old corps")</script> whig supporters elected to the secret committee to inquire into Walpole's conduct, but in spite of having supported the former minister on all previous occasions Strange's attitudes subsequently fell in line with those of the inquiry, and in May he voted in the Commons in favour of an (unsuccessful) opposition bill indemnifying such witnesses as chose to give evidence against Walpole.<br>
<br>It may have been later embarrassment for this act that caused Strange suddenly to resign all his legal appointments in November. A piece of satirical verse on his resignation entitled <span class="italic">The Causidicade</span> which appeared a few months later in 1743 insinuated darker reasons, speculating that Strange had resigned &#145;foreseeing approaching disgrace&#146;, but Strange himself, in his <span class="italic">Reports</span>, explained that he had done so &#145;having received a considerable addition to my fortune and some degree of ease and retirement being judged proper for my health&#146;  (Strange, 1176). His recent display of anti-Walpolian sentiment was not held against him, for on 27 November 1742 George II granted him precedence after the attorney-general for life. Strange continued to practise as a barrister but confined himself to morning sittings of the court of king's bench. His most important case work in these years came in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising; in 1746 he was one of the counsel for the crown at the trials of the rebels Francis Townley and Lord Balmerino, and in March 1747 acted as a manager of the impeachment of Lord Lovat, summing up the evidence against the peer in an hour-long speech.<br>
<br>In March 1750, after more than thirty years at the bar, Strange was prevailed upon by Hardwicke to accept judicial office as master of the rolls, and on 17 March, a week after his appointment took effect, he was sworn of the privy council. At the general election in the spring of 1754 he expressed indifference to retaining a parliamentary seat, but his mind was changed on hearing from the duke of Newcastle, the incoming first lord of the Treasury, the king's observation that it was essential the master of the rolls should have a seat in parliament. He died, however, on 18 May, a month after being re-elected at Totnes, and was buried next to his wife in the churchyard at Leyton, Essex, near the manor house which for many years had been his country residence. Newcastle extolled &#145;his many excellent public qualities and most amiable private ones&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 169).<br>
<br>Before his death Strange had been preparing his collection of reports for publication. Because of his willingness to lend his notes to judges there had been many opportunities for copies of this material, unscrupulously obtained, to pass into the hands of legal hacks. It included summaries and arguments of cases where no judgment had been made. It was Strange's chief concern, therefore, to have ready a definitive compilation of reports of adjudged cases that could be published in the event of any pirating of his work. Accordingly, when some of Strange's case notes did indeed appear shortly after his death under the title of <span class="italic">A Collection of Select Cases Relating to Evidence, by a Late Barrister-at-Law</span>, his executors acted swiftly to suppress it, and in 1755 his eldest son published the reports as authentically selected, dedicating them to Lord Hardwicke. Reprinted in second and third editions in 1782 and 1795, Strange's reports endured in their usefulness for the rest of the century and after.<br>
