<span class="headword">Glaisher <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Belville]</span>,  Cecilia Louisa</span>  (1828&#150;1892), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 20 April 1828 in Greenwich, Kent, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103436/', "John Henry Belville (1795?&#150;1856)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96694/', "Belville, (Elizabeth) Ruth")</script>], an assistant astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, who was possibly of French descent, and his second wife, Apollonia Slaney (1810/1811&#150;1851). She had two elder half-sisters and three elder half-brothers from her father's first marriage in 1819 to Sarah Dixon (<i>d</i>. 1826), and a younger half-sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96694/', "Ruth Belville")</script>, from his third in 1851 to Maria Elizabeth Last (1811/12&#150;1899) [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/103444">Maria Elizabeth Belville</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/96694">Belville,  (Elizabeth) Ruth</a>]. Little is known about her early life or education except for a pencilled note in one of her father's Greenwich workbooks recording that &#145;Cecilia took her first lesson in painting April 17th 1841 of Mr Villalobos&#146;. On 31 December 1843, at the age of fifteen years and eight months, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33419/', "James Glaisher (1809&#150;1903)")</script>, superintendent of the meteorological and magnetic department at the Royal Observatory. The legal age for marriage in England was twelve at the time. The Glaishers had three children: Cecilia Appelina (1845&#150;1932), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33420/', "James Whitbread Lee Glaisher (1848&#150;1928)")</script>, and Ernest Henry (1858&#150;1885).<br>
<br>Made during the 1850s, Cecilia Glaisher's work consists of photographs of ferns, illustrations of snow crystals, and coloured nature-prints of leaves. It is likely that she learned about photography, at least initially, through her husband and his scientific contacts at the Greenwich observatory, and by meeting other practitioners and experimenters in photography during visits to Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire, home of the antiquary and astronomer John Lee (1783&#150;1866). During the severe winter of 1854&#150;5 Cecilia and James Glaisher studied the formation of snow crystals. Cecilia Glaisher made drawings of 151 different crystal types that were used to illustrate the paper &#145;Snow crystals observed by James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S. from February 8th to March 10th 1855&#146;. These show with scientific accuracy in magnified detail varying forms of snow crystal structure, and reveal the beauty of a world not visible to the unaided human eye.<br>
<br>Also at this time Cecilia Glaisher undertook a project to photograph the British ferns, lifesize on folio paper, in collaboration with the fern expert and publisher Edward Newman, who supplied the specimens. Using William Henry Fox Talbot's photogenic drawing process, a fern specimen was arranged on a sheet of paper previously rendered light-sensitive by applications of salt and silver nitrate, placed in a printing frame, and exposed to sunlight until a negative image formed. After fixing, washing, and drying, the paper negative could be used to make multiple positive prints.<br>
<br>In September 1855 twelve prints of British ferns by Cecilia Glaisher were exhibited at the Glasgow Photographic Exhibition, held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. These examples of her work, entitled &#145;The British ferns, photographed from nature by Mrs Glaisher&#146;, which were seen alongside that of some of the most respected photographers of the day, publicized the project with Edward Newman. In the competitive world of fern publishing during the Victorian fern craze the intention was to use the still relatively new art of photography to rival in beauty and surpass in exactness the many fern publications illustrated by other techniques. In December 1855 Newman presented a portfolio of ten of Cecilia Glaisher's salt paper prints to the Linnean Society in London, along with a flyer advertising the work at a price not to exceed four guineas. However, for unknown reasons, but possibly due to difficulties in production, or in raising subscriptions, publication appears to have been abandoned in 1856. Cecilia Glaisher's other work at this time consists of coloured nature-prints of leaves collected in an album, &#145;Leaves of the British forest trees 1857 nature printed C J Glaisher&#146;, presumably the initials of both Cecilia and James Glaisher.<br>
<br>Family correspondence indicates that Cecilia Glaisher suffered ill health after the birth of Ernest, the Glaishers' third child, in 1858. At present nothing is known of work she may have done after that date, and from the early 1860s facts about her life are few. Latterly she lived in west London, where she died, at 162 Lancaster Road, Kensington, from bronchitis on 28 December 1892. She was buried in All Souls cemetery, Kensal Green, on 31 December.<br>
<br>Cecilia Glaisher had an intuitive feel for composition, an accurate eye for detail, and a sense of colour which she skilfully applied to nature-prints of leaves. She mixed media, using paint, ink, and photography, painstakingly retouching her photogenic drawings where necessary in order to get them to print more cleanly, overworking prints, altering the line of a fern frond, or painting-in details of rootball systems which had not registered adequately by photographic printing alone. Her photographs of ferns, recognized at the time from both a technical and an artistic point of view, remain a beautiful and unique body of work from the early years of photography.<br>
