<span class="headword">Holland <span class="st"> [Holand]</span>,  Thomas</span>, sixth earl of Kent and duke of Surrey  (<em>c.</em>1374&#150;1400), <span class="occ">magnate and courtier</span>, was the son and heir of Richard II's half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13544/', "Thomas Holland, earl of Kent (1350&#150;1397)")</script>, and Alice, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9534/', "Richard Fitzalan, earl of Arundel")</script>. He had two brothers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13518/', "Edmund Holland, later earl of Kent")</script>, and six sisters, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98133/', "Margaret Holland, later duchess of Clarence")</script>. John Holland, earl of Huntingdon and duke of Exeter, was his uncle. Thomas was not active in court circles until he reached adulthood, but he then became a leading supporter of Richard II.<br>
<br>Thomas Holland served on Richard II's Irish expedition in 1394, and he received two royal annuities, 200 marks in 1395, and &pound;10 the following year. He had married Joan, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26206/', "Hugh Stafford, earl of Stafford (d. 1386)")</script>, in 1392, in spite of his uncle John's murder of her brother in 1385. His own father's death on 25 April 1397 brought the young earl into the vortex of the crises of Richard II's final years. He found the assumption of his inheritance greatly eased by royal favour. Not only was he made warden of his father's lands while they were nominally in the king's hands, but he was also granted all issues and reliefs due to his royal uncle. Moreover the earl was made a knight of the Garter in place of his father.<br>
<br>The new earl of Kent was immediately summoned to Nottingham where the king was planning the destruction of Thomas, duke of Gloucester, one of the lords appellant who had challenged the king's power a decade earlier. After Gloucester was in custody, Kent and the earl of Rutland were sent to arrest another of the appellants, Kent's uncle, the earl of Arundel. When Arundel and his former colleague the earl of Warwick were brought to trial in the parliament of September 1397, the earls of Kent and Huntingdon served as two of the eight appellants who appealed the former lords appellant of treason. Kent urged Arundel's execution, which was carried out. When Warwick was exiled, Kent received Warwick Castle with the custody of Warwick's heir, as well as the earl's stud of horses and cattle. On 29 September 1397 Thomas Holland was created duke of Surrey, and John Holland was created duke of Exeter. Selden noted that the <i>virga aurea</i> was first used on this occasion. Surrey and Exeter were two of five men elevated to dukedoms at the time, an inflation of honours which led to the derisive title of <i>duketti</i>.<br>
<br>When Henry Bolingbroke, duke of Hereford, accused his fellow <i>dukettus</i> and former appellant colleague the duke of Norfolk of attempting to enlist him in a conspiracy to act against Richard II before the king attacked them, Hereford reported that Norfolk warned him that Surrey was one of those out to destroy them both. Surrey replaced Norfolk as marshal of England on 31 January 1398 so that he might officiate at the scheduled duel between Hereford and Norfolk. Surrey's father had held this post in 1380, but the 1398 appointment gave Surrey specific power to arrest traitors found within the realm. The duel never took place; both men were banished. The duke of Surrey became marshal for life and shared in the spoils of Norfolk's estates. After the death of Hereford's father, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, on 3 February 1399, Surrey received on 8 May custody of two Lancastrian manors until Bolingbroke or his heir should sue for livery. Surrey was also granted (on 18 February 1398) a licence to found a Carthusian priory called Mount Grace in his lordship of Bardelby in Cleveland; further grants to Surrey from the resources of alien priories helped to endow this house. The foundation of Mount Grace may demonstrate a degree of personal piety, but patronage of the Carthusians was also fashionable in court circles in the 1390s.<br>
<br>Richard II was greatly concerned to build up royal power in Ireland, and he hoped to employ Surrey in this endeavour. John Holland had had an abortive tenure as king's lieutenant in Ireland in 1382. Thomas Holland was now appointed to the office on 26 July 1398; the incumbent, Roger Mortimer, earl of March and Ulster, was ordered to have nothing to do with the office once Surrey arrived. Unknown to Richard at the time, Mortimer had been killed by the Irish on 20 July. An abstract of Surrey's indenture dated 10 April 1399 specifies that the duke was to command a retinue of 150 men-at-arms and 100 archers, including a mason and carpenter in every 20 archers. It has been argued that the indenture should be dated to 1398, but there seems no reason to assume such a scribal error so late in the regnal year. In May 1399 Surrey received 11,500 marks to support himself and his retinue in Ireland for one year. Surrey had been given wardship of the extensive Mortimer lands in Ireland; he was appointed keeper of Dublin Castle and of Drogheda; and he was given authority to present to all Irish benefices in the king's hands. On 16 May 1399, moreover, Thomas was appointed keeper of Carelogh Castle until the Mowbray heir sued for livery, and he was given the barony of Norragh while Art mac Murchada (<i>d</i>. 1417) remained a rebel. Norragh was one of the most prized estates of mac Murchada, the self-styled king of Leinster. The Lancastrian chronicler Adam of Usk improbably speculated that Richard II intended to crown Surrey king of Ireland. Richard II arrived in Ireland for his second campaign on 1 June 1399; Henry Bolingbroke landed in Yorkshire on 4 July.<br>
<br>Surrey returned with Richard to England, and he and the duke of Exeter attempted a reconciliation between Richard and Henry. Bolingbroke had no love for Surrey, and may have imprisoned him briefly at Chester, although the evidence is weak. On 20 October 1399 Surrey and other advisers of the deposed Richard II were arrested. Thomas Holland was committed to the Tower of London and then transferred to Wallingford. He was brought before parliament on 29 October where he pleaded his tender age as justification for his actions. On 6 November he and his uncle John were deprived of their dukedoms, and of the estates they had acquired after they had launched their appeal in 1397.<br>
<br>Once more earl of Kent, Thomas Holland joined his uncle John, the earl of Salisbury, and others in a plot to seize Henry IV and his sons at Windsor on 4 January 1400. The king had been warned and had withdrawn. Finding an empty nest, the conspirators rode to Richard's queen at Sonning. Kent announced that Richard II had escaped and was at Pontefract with 100,000 men. The conspiracy, betrayed by the earl of Rutland, soon collapsed. The conspirators fled to Cirencester where they were overcome by the townsmen. A priest in their company tried to cover their escape by torching a house. This further enraged the townsmen, who dragged the earls of Kent and Salisbury from the abbey in which they had sought refuge and beheaded them on the night of 7&#150;8 January 1400. Kent's head was placed on London Bridge; his body was interred at Cirencester. Cooled by its stay on the bridge, the head was reunited with Kent's body; both were buried at his foundation, Mount Grace. According to Froissart, he was &#145;much lamented by several knights in England and other countries. He was young and handsome, and had very unwillingly taken part in this conspiracy; but his uncle and the earl of Salisbury had forced him into it&#146;  (Froissart, 2.706). The earls' conspiracy probably induced Henry IV to do away with the imprisoned Richard II. Kent's widow, Joan, was detained at Liverpool, probably while attempting to escape to Ireland, and was taken to London, but was not harmed by Henry IV. She lived until 1442; there were no children from her marriage to Thomas Holland. There are inquisitions post mortem for Thomas Holland for Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Lincoln, and Middlesex, recording annual incomes in these counties amounting to nearly &pound;650.<br>
