<span class="headword">Pratt,  Joseph  Bishop</span>  (1854&#150;1910), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 1 January 1854 at 4 College Terrace, Camden New Town, London, the son of Anthony Pratt, a mezzotint engraver, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bishop. From 1868 he was apprenticed for five years to the noted mezzotint engraver John Lucas, of whom he made a portrait drawing (priv. coll.). Pratt's first published plate was <span class="italic">Maternal Felicity</span>, after Samuel Carter, issued in December 1873, proofs of which cost 4 guineas. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1874, when his address was given as 24 Kentish Town Road, London. On 26 August 1878 Pratt married Caroline Almader James, with whom he had six children. His eldest son, Stanley Claude Pratt (1882&#150;1914), trained under his father, and also became an engraver.<br>
<br>Pratt was a prolific and successful engraver who declared more than a hundred plates to the Print Sellers' Association. He worked in mezzotint, line, and mixed-method engraving. He was also significant for his work in colour, and also for engaging with new technology through his hand photogravures. His prints were signed in roughly equal proportion either &#145;Joseph B. Pratt&#146; or &#145;Bishop Pratt&#146;. He was known particularly for his engravings of animal and landscape pictures by Peter Graham, Sir Edwin Landseer, Frank Paton, Briton Rivi&egrave;re, and Rosa Bonheur, all issued by the leading print publishers of the day. From the mid-1890s he devoted himself increasingly to mezzotint, and executed a series of successful prints in this medium after the portraits of Reynolds, Gainsborough, Romney, Lawrence, Raeburn, and Hoppner, artists who were then enjoying renewed critical interest. Pratt generally chose unengraved subjects, and in his employment of mezzotint sought to evoke the prints of that period. Such plates often sold for the relatively high price of 10 guineas for an artist's proof.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Pratt's skill was widely admired, and exhibitions of his work were held by Agnews at Manchester and Liverpool in 1902, and by Vicars in Bond Street in 1904. A large collection of his prints is held by the British Museum. From 1878 until the mid-1890s he lived in Dartmouth Park Avenue, first at Lonsdale House and from 1891 at Northover. From 1897 his address was Carlton House, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, but in 1907 he moved to High Firs, Brenchley, Kent. He died on 23 December 1910 at 25 Dorset Square, London, following an operation, leaving an estate valued at almost &pound;22,000. He was survived by his widow.<br>
