<span class="headword">MacBride,  Ernest William</span>  (1866&#150;1940), <span class="occ">biologist</span>, was born on 12 December 1866 in Belfast, the first of the five children of Samuel MacBride, linen manufacturer, and his wife, Mary, daughter of a Presbyterian minister. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Insitution and Queen's College in Belfast, and then studied zoology at University College, London, where he obtained a BSc in 1889. He moved to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was elected fellow in 1893 after having obtained a first-class BA in zoology in 1891.<br>
<br>After a brief period of study at the Stazione Zoologica in Naples, MacBride returned to Cambridge as university demonstrator in animal morphology. Then in 1897 he was appointed professor of zoology at McGill University, Montreal. There he supervised the building of new laboratories and taught a zoology course, primarily to medical students. While in Canada, in 1902 he married Constance Harvey, daughter of H. Chrysler KC, an Ottawa barrister; they had two sons. In 1909 MacBride was appointed assistant to Adam Sedgwick, professor of zoology at Imperial College, London. He remained at Imperial until his retirement in 1934, succeeding Sedgwick in 1914 and developing a successful postgraduate research school.<br>
<br>MacBride built his scientific reputation on his studies of the embryology of invertebrates, especially the echinoderms (including starfish and sea-urchins). He published a series of papers and also the <span class="italic">Textbook of Embryology</span> (1914). When he trained in London and Cambridge, the minute study of embryological development was still seen as a vital source of information on evolutionary relationships. MacBride remained loyal to this belief, even when the vast majority of biologists turned away to other interests. Indeed, he was one of the last British scientists to defend in detail the theory that the development of the embryo recapitulates the evolutionary history of its species. Nevertheless, it was through the application of this theory that he made his most enduring contribution: his recognition that echinoderms (which are now characterized by radial symmetry) have evolved by degeneration from a bilaterally symmetrical form. He showed that the cushion star, <i>Asterina</i>, passes through a larval stage in which it is attached to the sea-bed. This he interpreted as the relic of an evolutionary stage in which the ancestors of the echinoderms gave up their free-swimming habits and began to degenerate into radial symmetry. He was one of the first to recognize that the ancestors of the echinoderms must have been closely related to the earliest chordates, from which the vertebrates have descended.<br>
<br>MacBride continued to defend the recapitulation theory long after most biologists rejected it in favour of new approaches to the study of development and heredity. He condemned the new science of genetics as based on the study of artificially induced characters. MacBride favoured the Lamarckian theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics: he believed that changes in bodily structure produced by new habits would gradually become incorporated into the species' inheritance. In effect, he maintained, heredity represents a memory of the species' past evolutionary modifications. In the 1920s he played a prominent role in defending the Lamarckian biologist Paul Kammerer against attacks by the geneticists. As a fluent German-speaker, MacBride provided on-the-spot translations for Kammerer when the latter visited London in April 1923.<br>
<br>MacBride's Lamarckism has deflected historians' attention from his extreme position on social issues. Through the 1920s he played a prominent role in the Eugenics Society, eventually becoming vice-president. He strongly endorsed claims that persons of &#145;inferior&#146; character should be prevented from reproducing, as a means of purifying the population. He argued for the compulsory sterilization of the least fit members of the British population, whom he identified as those of Irish descent. According to MacBride (who was of Ulster protestant stock), the Irish race had evolved in a less challenging environment than that which had produced the hardy Anglo-Saxons. His views on compulsory sterilization were not endorsed by the membership of the Eugenics Society, and in 1931 he resigned as vice-president. He defended the fascist side in the Spanish Civil War, and in 1937 he expressed support for German military policy.<br>
<br>Less controversially, MacBride served on the council and also as chairman of the Marine Biological Association. In 1913 he was appointed to a committee of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, formed to draw up a programme of investigation into Britain's fisheries. In 1919 he joined the advisory committee on fisheries research set up by the Development Commissioners, and was appointed chairman of the committee in 1933.<br>
<br>After his retirement MacBride moved to Alton in Hampshire, where he died at his home, Westbank, on 17 November 1940 and was buried on 25 November at St Lawrence's Church there. His wife survived him. He was remembered with affection by many of his students, who preferred to concentrate on his enthusiasm as a teacher rather than on his outdated theoretical opinions and controversial political stance.<br>
