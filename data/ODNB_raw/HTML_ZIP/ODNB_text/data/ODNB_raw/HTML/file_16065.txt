<span class="headword">Lapraik,  John</span>  (1727&#150;1807), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Laigh Dalquhram, near Muirkirk, Ayrshire. After education in the parochial school he succeeded his father on the estate, which was of considerable extent, and had been in the family for generations. He also rented the lands and mill of Muirsmill, in the neighbourhood. In 1754 he married Margaret Rankine, sister of Burns's friend, &#145;rough, rude, ready-witted Rankine&#146;. She died after the birth of her fifth child, and in 1766 Lapraik married Janet Anderson (1740/41&#150;1826), a farmer's daughter, who bore nine children, and survived her husband by nineteen years.<br>
<br>Ruined by the collapse of the Ayr Bank on 12 August 1773, Lapraik had first to let and then to sell his estate, and after an interval to relinquish his mill and farms, on which for several years he struggled to exist. Confined for a time during 1785 as a debtor, he figured as a prison bard.<br>
<br>Early in 1785 Burns heard the song &#145;When I upon thy bosom lean&#146; at a &#145;rocking&#146;, or social gathering, in his house at Mossgiel Farm, Muirkirk. Learning that Lapraik was the author, he made his acquaintance, and within the year addressed to him his three famous &#145;Epistles&#146;. Lapraik's other significant connection with Burns, according to local legend at least, is that he helped inspire the sentiments of &#145;Is there for honest poverty&#146; (&#145;A Man's a Man for a' that&#146;). Burns sent an improved version of Lapraik's song to Johnson's <span class="italic">Scots Musical Museum</span>. An early version of the song may be one of the lyrics published in the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine</span>, 14 October 1773.<br>
<br>Burns's generous patronage encouraged Lapraik to publish his verses, which appeared at Kilmarnock in 1788 as <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>. The volume contains nothing equal to &#145;When I upon thy bosom lean&#146;. James Maxwell of Paisley notices Lapraik unfavourably in his <span class="italic">Animadversions on some Poets and Poetasters of the Present Age</span> (1788).<br>
<br>After 1796 Lapraik opened a public house in Kirk Street, Muirkirk, conducting also the village post office on the same premises. Here he died on 7 May 1807 and was buried in the churchyard of Muirkirk parish church. A cairn was erected in 1914 by the &#145;Lapraik Burns Club&#146; of Muirkirk to mark the spot where Lapraik's house once stood at Laigh Dalquhram.<br>
