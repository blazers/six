<span class="headword">Kyan,  Esmonde</span>  (1750&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was the third son of Howard Kyan (1711&#150;1766), landowner, of Mount Howard, and Frances Esmonde (<i>d</i>. 1785), daughter of Lawrence Esmonde and sister of Sir James Esmonde, seventh baronet (1701&#150;1767), of Ballinastragh, co. Wexford. Early in his life he served as an artillery officer in the British army. After leaving the army he lost his left arm, having been fired on by a debtor; he was subsequently fitted with an artificial arm. However, this did not inhibit his activity as a United Irish artillery officer during the insurrection of 1798. He was married twice, first to Mary Ann Byrne on 16 March 1774 in the Franciscan chapel at Wexford. They had five daughters. After her death he married Margaret Furlong of Kincone, Ferrybank, Wexford, and they had two sons, who both died young, and one daughter. John Howard Kyan (1774&#150;1850), inventor of kyanizing; was his nephew.<br>
<br>5 feet 6 inches in height and regarded as handsome, Kyan was one of the outstanding figures in the social, commercial, and political life of co. Wexford. He was a senior partner in the banking and minting firm of Kyan and Carnac. His instinct for humour and wit was noted by friends and even recorded by enemies in battle. He became an early adherent to the United Irish Society and, because of his army experience, achieved military rank at colonel level in the north-east (Ballaghreen) area of co. Wexford. At the outbreak of the rebellion in co. Wexford on 26 May 1798 he was arrested and lodged with other suspects in the market house at Gorey. Following the remarkable rebel victory at nearby Tubberneering he was rescued from imminent execution, and he immediately took command of the captured artillery pieces with such effect that the crown forces under General Loftus abandoned north Wexford. He was badly injured at the battle of Arklow and never completely recovered.<br>
<br>Kyan was recuperating at his wife's family home at Ferrybank when, on 21 June, he heard of the killing of loyalists by a mob on the adjacent Wexford Bridge; he crossed the bridge, confronted the crowd, and saved several lives. He marched north with the insurgent division which headed for the Wicklow Mountains following defeat at the major battle of Vinegar Hill on 21 June 1798. Unable to withstand the rigours of the march, he returned to Ferrybank, where he was arrested. He was tried and then hanged on 24 June 1798 on Wexford Bridge within twenty-four hours of his arrest. Had he reached the Wicklow Mountains his life would have been saved under the surrender terms arranged with General Dundas. His brother-in-law, Patrick Furlong, recovered his body from the Slaney River and had it interred beside the Furlong family grave in Ardcavan churchyard, Castlebridge, co. Wexford. A simple monument was erected in 1938 to mark Kyan's last resting place.<br>
