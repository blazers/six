<span class="headword">Bullen,  Edward</span>  (1813&#150;1868), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born at Taunton, on 3 April 1813, the son of Robert Uttermare Bullen, an attorney. He was educated at the Benedictine College of Douai, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1833. (He should not be confused with a Gray's Inn barrister of the same name, called in 1852.) As a Roman Catholic he was unable to subscribe to the oaths required for call to the bar, and therefore followed the course set by others in the same plight&#151;notably Charles Butler (<i>d</i>. 1832), also of Douai and Lincoln's Inn&#151;by practising &#145;below the bar&#146;. Such practitioners had no rights of audience in court, but were permitted to engage in chambers practice either as conveyancers or special pleaders. Bullen chose pleading, and became one of the most celebrated pleaders of the century. He is first mentioned in the <span class="italic">Law List</span> for 1838, when he was practising at 2 Elm Court. The privilege of reading as a pupil in his chambers was highly prized.<br>
<br>Bullen wrote <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on the Law of Distress for Rent and of Things Damage Feasant</span> in 1842, a work which achieved a second edition in 1899 but which was destined to be overtaken by more detailed treatises on the same subject. A pamphlet which he published in 1853 on the changing relationship between landlord and tenant indicates his continuing interest in that branch of the law. His lasting renown, however, was due to his classic <span class="italic">Precedents of Pleadings in Common Law</span>, compiled in collaboration with a former pupil, Stephen Martin Leake, and which first appeared in 1860. The object was to produce a collection of simple modern precedents in conformity with the new pleading system introduced by the <span class="roman">Common Law Procedure Act</span> 1852, and the rules made under it, which put an end to the fictions and prolix formalities which had characterized special pleading during the first twenty years of Bullen's professional life. The book was an enormous success and became the <i>vade mecum</i> of every common-law barrister; an extended second edition appeared in 1863, and by the time of the fourth edition (1882) the work's original length had been doubled. Despite the many further reforms introduced throughout the next century, which necessitated heavy revision by successive editors, the work of Bullen and Leake was still in use (as Bullen, Leake, and Jacob) in the thirteenth edition of 1990.<br>
<br>Bullen died at his London home, 82 Belsize Park Gardens, on 19 July 1868, after reading the proofs of the third edition of <span class="italic">Precedents of Pleadings</span>. He was survived by his wife, Louise. Three of his sons were barristers who had served as pupils in his chambers. His eldest son, Edward Uttermare, born about 1838, was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1856, called to the bar in 1860, and joined the western circuit. The second son, Charles Louis, became a member of the same inn in 1857 but does not appear to have been called or to have practised. Another son, Thomas Joseph, born in 1845, joined the Inner Temple in 1864, and practised as a special pleader until 1883, when he was called to the bar. He assisted Leake in the completion of the third edition of <span class="italic">Precedents of Pleadings</span>, was co-editor of the 1882 edition, and also helped to prepare the 1899 edition of Bullen's <span class="italic">Distress</span>.<br>
