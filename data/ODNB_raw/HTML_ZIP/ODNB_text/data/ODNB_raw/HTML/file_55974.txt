<span class="headword">Sichel,  Edith Helen</span>  (1862&#150;1914), <span class="occ">historian and philanthropist</span>, was born on 13 December 1862 at 25 Princes Gardens, London, the daughter of Michael Sichel (1819&#150;1884), a cotton merchant, and his wife, Helena Reiss (1833&#150;1888); her parents were Christians, but of German Jewish descent. She was well educated, becoming proficient in French, German, and Latin. In 1876 she met and formed a close friendship with Mary Elizabeth Coleridge (1861&#150;1907), with whom she went to read Greek classics with William Johnson Cory (1823&#150;1892), the poet and former master at Eton. She also attended Professor John Wesley Hales's lectures on Elizabethan and Jacobean drama in 1880.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-three Edith Sichel joined the Whitechapel branch of the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants. Through her work here she met Canon Samuel Barnett and his wife Henrietta, and also Emily Ritchie, who became her closest friend. Her philanthropy, informed by her deep Christian faith, was essentially conservative and individualistic: accepting as God-given the class system of Victorian society, she held that the core of her mission was the creation and development of personal friendships, and had little interest in administrative and committee work which resulted from the growth of institutional social work.<br>
<br>Sichel's faith in personal initiative in philanthropic work was evidenced by her private projects, pursued after bad health had forced her to abandon her work in the East End in 1891. In 1889 she and Emily Ritchie established a nursery for East End workhouse children in Chiddingfold near Witley, where they were renting a cottage. When they moved to The Hurst, Hambledon, in 1891 they started a home for Whitechapel girls, where they intended to train them for domestic service. In &#145;The confessions of an amateur philanthropist&#146; (reprinted posthumously in <span class="italic">Old and New</span>, 1917) Edith Sichel gave an amusing description of her endeavours with her prot&eacute;g&eacute;es: working with about six girls at a time, she combined domestic training in housework and cookery (a laundry proved unsuccessful) with outdoor rambles, intended to improve their health and&#151;with the aid of poetry and botany&#151;widen their minds. A similar project for older girls proved unsuccessful, but the original home was still thriving when Sichel died. She was also treasurer of a boys' home in Islington for twenty-two years, and from 1893 to 1905 she was manager of the Ashburnham and Park Walk Schools in Chelsea. Subsequently she assisted school-leavers seeking employment.<br>
<br>However, Edith Sichel's leading interest from the 1890s was her literary career. Her first published work, the tale of a Wapping girl entitled &#145;Jenny&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> in 1887, was inspired by her East End work. She became a steady contributor to journals and magazines, including <span class="italic">The Pilot</span>, the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, revealing herself to be an enthusiastic, perceptive, and generous reviewer of histories, biographies, and memoirs. In 1893 she published <span class="italic">Worthington Junior</span>, an undistinguished novel, before turning to the more congenial pursuit of French history. <span class="italic">The Story of Two Salons</span> (1895) described the salons of the Suards and Pauline de Beaumont, while <span class="italic">The Household of the Lafayettes</span> (1897) dealt with the pre- and post-Revolution history of a prominent French family. In 1903, with G. W. E. Russell, she published <span class="italic">Mr Woodhouse's Correspondence</span>, a collection of comic correspondence (which had originally appeared in <span class="italic">The Pilot</span>) between the family and associates of the imaginary Algernon Wentworth-Woodhouse, a rich, miserly, and valetudinarian egotist. This was followed in 1906 by <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of Alfred Ainger</span>, a tribute to a close friend. Another such tribute appeared in 1910, when she contributed a memoir to <span class="italic">Gathered Leaves</span>, a posthumous collection of pieces by Mary Coleridge, whose death in 1907 was a considerable blow. <span class="italic">Women and Men of the French Renaissance</span> (1901) foreshadowed more directly her <i>magnum opus</i>, a two-volume account of the life and career of Catherine de' Medici, published as <span class="italic">Catherine de'Medici and the French Reformation</span> (1905) and <span class="italic">The Later Years of Catherine de'Medici</span> (1908). <span class="italic">The Renaissance</span>, written for H. A. L. Fisher's <span class="roman">Home University Library of Modern Knowledge</span> series, and <span class="italic">Michel de Montaigne</span>, both published in 1911, were the last of her works to appear in her lifetime. In humorous self-deprecation, Sichel described herself as &#145;only a gossiping lady's maid who curls the hair of History&#146;. In fact her histories were well researched in primary as well as secondary sources, and she believed that a woman historian could have a distinctive and serious role in exploring the more personal and domestic aspects of history. Vivid, impressionistic portraits of many leading figures in French courts and salons bear witness to her appropriately Renaissance belief that history was &#145;human life remembered&#146;  (Ritchie, 147, 45).<br>
<br>In 1911 Edith Sichel began to hold classes for female prisoners at Holloway Prison, where her sister was already a visitor. She became deeply interested in the 1914 <span class="roman">Prison Reform Bill</span>, drawing up a report for the commissioners of prisons and attending police courts to examine sentencing. This additional work may have contributed to her unexpected death, on the night of 13 August 1914, while visiting friends at Borwick Hall, near Carnforth, Lancashire.<br>
<br>Edith Sichel was remembered by her contemporaries as a woman of great charm, witty, cultivated, and cheerful, with a genius for friendship. Both her books and her letters reveal an attractive and vivacious personality. While her poetry is generally third rate and laboured, her prose is elegant, absorbing, and seasoned with epigrams. Her appearance was striking rather than handsome&#151;photographs show a large-featured, dark-haired woman, a sort of beautified George Eliot&#151;but observers commented on her expressive face, &#145;full of mobility, vigour and refinement&#146;  (Cornish, 217).<br>
