<span class="headword">Turner,  Joseph</span>  (1745&#150;1828), <span class="occ">college head and dean of Norwich</span>, was born at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 3 October 1745 into a family long associated with the town. He was the third of four sons of the Revd Francis Turner (1716&#150;1790), minister of St George's Chapel, Great Yarmouth (1742&#150;90), and rector of South Elmham (1743&#150;90), and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dawson, also from Great Yarmouth. Turner began a lifelong connection with Pembroke College, Cambridge, when he was admitted as a sizar on 26 January 1763 and matriculated at Lent the same year. He graduated BA (senior wrangler) in 1767, MA in 1770, and DD in 1785.<br>
<br>In October 1773 Turner was elected lecturer in Greek and Hebrew at Pembroke, serving as tutor in mathematics from 1776 alongside George Pretyman, both men including William Pitt the younger among their charges. Turner took a genuine interest in the progress of all the undergraduates, as one of them, Henry Ainslie, reported on 3 November 1777, after completing his examinations, &#145;when he [Turner] heard I was first he shook my hand for 10 minutes &amp; paid me a thousand compliments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gazette</span>, 15). Turner's teaching and administrative services to Pembroke were recognized by his nomination as master in 1784 in succession to James Brown, a post he held until his death. It was fortunate that Turner's appointment roughly coincided with Pitt's assumption of the premiership. This ensured that Pembroke's welfare (and Turner's own) were not overlooked at the highest levels of government. Turner's quiet efficiency as master contributed to the continuing academic distinction enjoyed by the college in the late eighteenth century. This scholarly revival continued until at least the halfway point in his mastership. Thereafter Turner's increasing age, residence for three or four months yearly in Norwich, and differences of opinion with some of the fellows (he failed in legal proceedings to obtain the use of a property bequest to Pembroke) may have adversely affected the college.<br>
<br>Turner's administrative abilities were also called upon when he twice served as vice-chancellor of the university (in 1785&#150;6 and 1805&#150;6). During both terms he presented addresses to George III on behalf of the university: the first, attended by William Pitt, Edward Eliot (Pitt's brother-in-law), and George Pretyman, congratulating the king on the preservation of his life after Margaret Nicholson's assassination attempt; the second offering a loyal expression of thanks for Nelson's victory at Trafalgar.<br>
<br>Turner undoubtedly benefited from Pretyman's role as secretary to William Pitt and subsequently from his promotion to the bishopric of Lincoln in 1787. Pitt secured his former teacher a second major post in 1790 when Turner was named dean of Norwich, being installed and inducted on 24 June. Thereafter he resided for part of the year in Norwich, attended the twice-yearly meeting of the general chapter, and was conscientious in his discharge of chapter business. He married on 5 January 1793, at Lambeth Palace, Mary (<i>b</i>. 15 Jan 1764), the eldest daughter of Philip Derbyshire. She died on 10 March 1804, and was buried in Norwich Cathedral on 17 March. Six years later, on 3 January 1810, he married Mary, daughter of John Taylor of Great Yarmouth. During these Norwich years a restoration of the cathedral took place which showed a sensitivity to fittings not always evidenced by late Georgian chapters. Turner oversaw the major repairs to the cathedral fabric undertaken in 1806. These included the provision of a new pulpit and extra seats in the choir. However, failing health in the 1820s curtailed the extent of his appearances in Norwich, and by that date chapter records suggest a perceptible decline in organizational efficiency.<br>
<br>First and foremost an administrator Turner published nothing, but became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1801. In addition to his mastership and deanery he was also awarded by the crown the wealthy rectories of Sudbourne and Orford in Suffolk in 1787, and held them until his death at the deanery, Norwich, on 2 August 1828. He was buried in the choir of Norwich Cathedral on 12 August, where a brass recalls that: &#145;The general uprightness and integrity of his character were invariably acknowledged by all with whom the duties of his public situations brought him in connection&#146;. Turner was survived by one son from his first marriage, William Hamilton (<i>b</i>. 1803), who became a country clergyman. His second wife died on 25 February 1842 and was buried at St Peter Mancroft, Norwich.<br>
