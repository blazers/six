<span class="headword">Eleanor</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Eleanor Cobham]</span>, duchess of Gloucester  (<em>c.</em>1400&#150;1452), <span class="occ">alleged sorcerer</span>, was the second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14155/', "Humphrey, duke of Gloucester")</script>, and attracted notoriety when convicted and imprisoned for treasonable necromancy in 1441. The fourth child of Sir Reginald (or Reynold) Cobham of Sterborough, Lingfield, Surrey, and his first wife, Eleanor, she became about 1422, the year of her mother's death, an attendant of Jacqueline d'Hainault, who, on divorcing John (IV), duke of Brabant, had fled to England in 1421 and in 1423 married Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (1390&#150;1447). After unsuccessfully invading Hainault to assert his wife's claims Humphrey returned to England in March 1425 and Eleanor became his mistress. When in January 1428 his marriage with Jacqueline was pronounced invalid he married Eleanor. Though condemned as a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, the union proved a success. Eleanor was beautiful, intelligent, and ambitious and Humphrey was cultivated, pleasure-loving, and famous. Together they developed a manor at Greenwich into a pleasure garden, La Plesaunce, encircled by a wall with walks bordering the Thames, a tower, and a conduit. Here they gathered poets, musicians, scholars, physicians, and their friends to form a miniature court.<br>
<br>In the year 1435&#150;6 when, on Bedford's death, Duke Humphrey became heir apparent and attained the height of his influence, Eleanor was accorded full recognition of her position: in November 1435 he created a jointure for her in his whole estate and in April 1436 she received the robes of a duchess for the Garter ceremony. At court she exercised some influence over the young king and became obsessed with the possibility of her husband's succeeding the unmarried and inert Henry VI. It was in this context that she began&#151;certainly by April 1440&#151;to consult astrologers to cast the king's horoscope and to predict her personal fortunes. This of itself was neither suspicious nor unusual. Mathematical astrology had become socially and academically respectable and other great noblemen had astrologers in their employ. Those whom Eleanor consulted were Thomas Southwell, her physician, canon of St Stephen's, Westminster, and Roger Bolingbroke, principal of St Andrew's Hall, Oxford&#151;both men of high reputation. Unwisely, if honestly, from their reading of Henry VI's horoscope they predicted that a serious illness would endanger his life in July or August 1441. Rumours of this spread in London and reached the court. The authorities thereupon commissioned an alternative horoscope to reassure the king and took steps&#151;on 28 and 29 June 1441&#151;to examine Southwell, Bolingbroke, and Eleanor's chaplain, John Home, canon of Hereford. Between 10 and 12 July they were arrested and charged with necromancy and heretical practices and Eleanor fled to sanctuary in Westminster. On 23 July Bolingbroke was examined before the council and named Eleanor as the instigator. On 24 and 25 July she was examined by a panel of bishops on eighteen charges of treasonable necromancy, five of which she admitted. She was committed to Leeds Castle pending trial. After further investigations Southwell and Bolingbroke were indicted for sorcery, felony, and treason, with Eleanor as an accessory. But on her insistence it was again before an ecclesiastical tribunal that she was judged on 21 October; she denied most of the charges but admitted procuring potions from Margery Jourdemayne, the Witch of Eye (Ebury, near Westminster), in order to conceive and bear Duke Humphrey's child. On 27 July she abjured her errors and on 9 November penance was imposed on her to walk barefoot to three London churches on successive market days in November bearing a taper. She was forcibly divorced and condemned to perpetual imprisonment. Her associates suffered more harshly: Southwell died in the Tower of London, Bolingbroke was hanged, drawn, and quartered, and Margery was burnt.<br>
<br>Eleanor was imprisoned initially at Chester, then in 1443 moved to Kenilworth, in July 1446 to the Isle of Man, and finally in March 1449 to Beaumaris, where she died on 7 July 1452 and was buried, presumably in the parish church. How guilty was she? Although she had instigated predictions of the king's illness this fell short of devising the means to encompass his death. She admitted procuring love potions and had perhaps participated in casting spells. Such practices, common to all classes, attracted particular suspicion and alarm where women exercised influence at a high level. It is possible that her exposure was plotted by her husband's political enemies, who certainly exploited it to estrange the king from his uncle and implant suspicions which led to Humphrey's own arrest and death six years later. Finally the problem of how peeresses should be tried was resolved by a statute making them, like their husbands, judicable by the lords and judges.<br>
