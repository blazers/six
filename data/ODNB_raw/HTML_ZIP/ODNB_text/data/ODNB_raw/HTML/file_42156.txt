<span class="headword">Sunlight,  Joseph</span>  (1889&#150;1978), <span class="occ">architect and property developer</span>, was born in Novogrudock, Belorussia, then part of the Russian empire, on 2 January 1889 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> (20 December 1888 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>), the son of Israel Schimschlavitch, afterwards Sunlight (1864&#150;1945), and his wife, Minnie (<i>d</i>. 1941). His father, like many Russian Jews, was anxious to evade conscription into the tsarist army and the family emigrated to Britain in 1890. Israel, who was a cotton merchant, and Joe became naturalized British subjects on 10 July 1900, adopting the surname of Sunlight, no doubt after Port Sunlight in Cheshire, but the family settled in Manchester.<br>
<br>Sunlight's was a classic rags-to-riches life story. For his education it seems that he was sent to London to private school in Kingston upon Thames. Unusually for a first-generation Jewish immigrant, he trained as an architect, in the office of William Purdey of Brazenose Street, Manchester. He began his apprenticeship in 1904 earning 3 <i>s</i>. a week. In 1907, at the age of eighteen, he had set up on his own at 4 St Ann's Square, &#145;and before he was 21 had designed and built more than 1000 houses in Prestwich&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span>, 18 April 1978). He himself boasted that &#145;By 1921 [he] could account for one million pounds sterling worth of buildings from [his] plans&#146;  (&#145;Sunlight House AD 1929&#146;, Sunlight papers). Sunlight acted as architect&#150;developer, buying up land, planning, designing, and building whole estates and then selling or letting the properties. He also built factories and warehouses in Cheetham, many of them for Jewish clients, immigrant entrepreneurs like himself. His best-known building in Manchester is Sunlight House, Quay Street, just off Deansgate in the city centre. At fourteen storeys and 135 feet, this art deco steel and concrete building clad in Portland stone was claimed to be the first skyscraper in the north of England when erected in 1932&#150;3 as the headquarters of Sunlight's building empire. The original scheme was scaled down from thirty storeys after being blocked by the city council. After the Second World War (1948&#150;9) he designed a 40-floor extension, intended by Sunlight to be Manchester's answer to New York's Rockefeller Center; but this was never built. A decade later Sunlight House, rented out as offices to the Ministry of Works, had fallen into a dilapidated condition. Sunlight was criticized as a bad landlord and for allegedly overcharging his tenants, and in 1959 the dispute with the ministry led to a court case. Very late in the 1990s the grade II listed landmark was renovated and adapted for reuse as shops and offices. Sunlight became a member of the Institute of Registered Architects on 31 January 1942 but, it seems, never bothered to apply to become an FRIBA.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-four Sunlight won a limited competition, in which six architects participated, for South Manchester Synagogue, Wilbraham Road, Fallowfield (1913). This was his only known commission for a religious building. The synagogue was built in the style of a Turkish mosque with dome and minaret, in a simplified, almost cubist manner. Sunlight himself claimed to have used &#145;St Sophia of Constantinople&#146; as his model, with the tower (which in execution had to be scaled down by 20 feet on grounds of economy) derived from Westminster Cathedral. In the estimation of the <span class="italic">British Architect</span> the whole gave &#145;a very satisfactory effect of an Eastern place of worship&#146;  (20 Feb 1914, 157&#150;8). While exhibiting a mix of stylistic influences, there can be no argument over the fact that the construction of South Manchester Synagogue was innovative. Reinforced concrete was used for the 35 feet span of the dome and for the lattice girders carrying the gallery, thus dispensing with the need for column supports beneath, probably the earliest application of this technology to synagogue architecture in Britain. Always a great publicist, Sunlight made sure that his work was written up in the architectural press.<br>
<br>Sunlight had a brief political career, being elected Liberal MP for Shrewsbury in 1923&#151;some achievement for a Russian-born Jew in a constituency with a staunchly conservative history and where his family origins had been made something of an election issue. In June 1924 he introduced a private member's bill to make all bricks a standard size. The ideal dimensions of a &#145;Sunlight brick&#146; were 9 inches by 4 &frac12; inches by 3 &frac12; inches. He proposed that bricks used in all state-subsidized housing schemes conform to these specifications. The rationale was that the greater thickness would reduce the number of bricks required per unit, thus making building quicker and cheaper&#151;with the unarticulated additional benefit of facilitating Sunlight's own speculative housing schemes. Unfortunately he faced practical opposition from builders and bricklayers as well as ideological objections to the increased state interference in the building trade that the measure represented. The bill passed by a single vote but was lost, along with Sunlight's seat, in 1924. A contemporary newspaper lampooned:<blockquote>
<div>You will never quicken housing<br>
</div>
<div>By such childish little tricks<br>
</div>
<div>As a Bill for making people<br>
</div>
<div>Manufacture bigger bricks.<br>
</div>
<div>No; what's wanted, Mr Sunlight,<br>
</div>
<div>Is a measure which contains<br>
</div>
<div>Some provision which will give our<br>
</div>
<div>Union leaders <i>bigger brains</i>.<br>
</div> (Sunlight's press cutting book, Sunlight papers, Portico Library, Manchester)</blockquote>Sunlight's personality, like some of his buildings, was larger than life. He was fond of mythologizing his youth in Russia, where his family faced persecution and he himself on more than one occasion narrowly escaped premature death. He claimed to have survived being run over by a troika on a bridge at the age of two and subsequently being dropped into the river at the same spot. In Manchester his father, Israel, became well known as a committed Zionist, promoter of Jewish education, and founder of the Holy Law Synagogue. Joe Sunlight professed his &#145;great love for the Jewish faith&#146; imbued in him by his Hebrew teacher in Russia, &#145;which I have always retained&#146;  (will). Yet his lifestyle, especially after the Second World War, was that of a moneyed English gentleman. In addition to his London address at 14 Victoria Square, Belgravia, he owned a large mansion called Hallside in Chelford Road, Knutsford, Cheshire. His wife, Edith Forshaw (1913&#150;2000), though she identified with her father-in-law's Zionist causes, came from a fairly humble Church of England background; her father was a motor engineer. Edith was nearly half Joe's age and they finally married in a register office in Brighton on 8 May 1940. Their only son, Ben Sunlight, the artist, had been born in Brighton in 1935; he died in 2002.<br>
<br>Sunlight died an eccentric millionaire at his home, Hallside, on 15 April 1978, and was remembered chiefly for Sunlight House and for his love of gambling and horse-racing. He left &pound;500 to the minister at Wilbraham Road &#145;in recognition of his having looked after the South Manchester Synagogue (which I consider as my monument) with such loving care for so many years&#146;  (will). He was buried on 17 April in the Jewish section of the southern cemetery, Barlow Moor Road, Manchester.<br>
