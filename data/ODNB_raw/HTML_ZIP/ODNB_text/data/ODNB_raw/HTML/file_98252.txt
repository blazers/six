<span class="headword">Duroveray,  Jacques-Antoine</span>  (1747&#150;1814), <span class="occ">political exile and politician in Geneva</span>, was born at Geneva into a poor labouring family. Little is known about Duroveray's early life, aside from his education in law at the Coll&egrave;ge de Gen&egrave;ve and his qualification as an advocate in 1771. In spite of his youth he was named from 1766 among the leaders of the <i>repr&eacute;sentant</i> movement. This sought to reform the constitutional and penal laws of the city-state by expanding the powers of the sovereign <i>conseil g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>, which met twice yearly to elect magistrates and to which grievances were &#145;represented&#146;. From 1770 Duroveray and his associate &Eacute;tienne Clavi&egrave;re served as members of a commission to provide a new law code for the city, and from 1775 Duroveray was a member of the executive <i>conseil des deux cents</i>, sitting alongside magistrates who sought to defend the <i>status quo</i>. On 19 December 1779 Duroveray was elected to one of the leading magisterial positions, that of <i>procureur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>. Speaking in the <i>petit conseil</i>, the highest executive council of state, Duroveray attacked French involvement in Genevan politics in what became known as the <i>fameuse remonstrance</i> of 11 December 1780. Matters came to a head when the magistrates were overthrown by an armed rising, led by Duroveray and Clavi&egrave;re, in February 1782. Duroveray then made his first visit to London to seek support for the new regime. This proved unsuccessful, and in July the uprising was suppressed and Duroveray fled Geneva. His fate was to be permanently exiled by the returning magistrates.<br>
<br>Duroveray went first to the Prussian protectorate of Neuch&acirc;tel. Good relations between his fellow exile Fran&ccedil;ois D'Ivernois and Lord Mountstuart, the British envoy to Sardinia, led the <i>repr&eacute;sentants</i> to formulate plans to establish a manufacturing centre&#151;to be known as New Geneva&#151;at Waterford in Ireland. The scheme, for which Duroveray acted as a commissioner while resident in Dublin, enjoyed the support of the prime minister, Lord Shelburne, and the lord lieutenant, the third Earl Temple, though it ultimately ended in failure. Despite this Duroveray became a British subject in 1783, and now sought to obtain a chair in public law at Trinity College, Dublin  (<span class="italic">The Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland</span>, 4 vols., HMC, 24, 1888&#150;1905, 4.130). On 19 March 1785 he was awarded an annual government pension of &pound;300 in recompense for his contribution to the New Geneva project.<br>
<br>In the previous year Duroveray, along with D'Ivernois, had moved to London. Here he became a prominent member of the exiled Genevan community, which from 1786 also included the pastor and political writer &Eacute;tienne Dumont, who had taken up a position as tutor in the household of Lord Shelburne (from 1786 third marquess of Lansdowne). Duroveray developed a strong friendship with Dumont and this gave him access to Lansdowne's assembly of intellectuals and reformers&#151;the Bowood circle&#151;which included Jeremy Bentham, the diplomatist Benjamin Vaughan, the politician and legal reformer Samuel Romilly, Richard Price, and Charles Stanhope, Lord Mahon, to whom Duroveray was particularly close, having been acquainted with Stanhope since his residence in Geneva during the 1760s and early 1770s. Duroveray also maintained excellent relations with &Eacute;tienne Clavi&egrave;re who, having left Ireland, pursued a financial career in Paris. In 1788 Duroveray visited the French capital with Dumont with the intention of persuading Louis XVI to repudiate the French &#145;guarantee&#146; of Geneva's constitution. As with visits a decade earlier, the mission ended in failure.<br>
<br>The exiles' banishment was ended on 17 February 1789 after a second rising in Geneva. Duroveray was torn between Geneva and Paris. While his central intention was to reform the Genevan constitution, he also realized that unless the French guarantee was abandoned any reform might be short-lived. With Dumont he left London in March 1789 for Paris, where he became part of the influential Genevan <i>atelier de Mirabeau</i> responsible for many of the speeches delivered in the national assembly by the comte de Mirabeau, in addition to contributions to Mirabeau's newspaper, the <span class="italic">Courier de Provence</span>. According to Dumont's posthumously published <span class="italic">Souvenirs sur Mirabeau</span> (1832) Duroveray led the way in using Mirabeau to persuade members of the assembly to show sympathy for British laws and political practices. Indeed Duroveray's intention was that the French should institute a constitution on the British model. He was also reputed to be behind the creation of a national guard based on the bourgeois militia he believed to thrive in Britain, and he also favoured making French government ministers members of the new legislative assembly, following the practice of British parliamentary government. Duroveray's approach led, in June 1789, to accusations from Anglophobe members of the assembly that he was a British agent.<br>
<br>In 1790 Duroveray returned to Geneva and once more took up a position of leadership, being credited with the authorship of the new constitution, the <i>&eacute;dit du 22 Mars 1791</i>. With D'Ivernois he was involved in negotiations to protect the independence of the state against France in 1792, an issue that pitted him against Clavi&egrave;re, now a minister in Paris working to create a more powerful French republic. Duroveray sought to combat both the French threat and the growing political unrest in Geneva. For a time he found a new recipient for his proposals in Charles Maurice Talleyrand, and he was involved in Talleyrand's diplomatic missions that went to London in an attempt to negotiate peace between Britain and France in 1792 and 1793. In October 1793 Duroveray left London for Morges on Lake Geneva, where he acted as a British agent with a brief to supply information about the French republic and its activities in Switzerland. He was subsequently denounced by the Jacobin Club as William Pitt's leading agent in the region. In correspondence with the British Home Office official Evan Nepean&#151;in which he offered his services and subsequently supplied reports on French military movements&#151;Duroveray mentioned a wife and daughter, though nothing else is known of his family.<br>
<br>Duroveray returned permanently to London at some point before the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798. When France annexed Geneva he was not granted French citizenship on the basis of the threat he posed to the new state and &#145;for his attachment to England&#146;  (Soulavie, 5.217). There is very little information concerning his activities in the following decade. He remained close to Dumont and D'Ivernois, but did not establish a new career in Britain as they did, though he continued to draw his government pension. He retained his interest in Geneva and sent reform projects to friends and politicians after the city-state had regained its independence late in 1813. He was about to return to Geneva, and no doubt to front-line politics, when he died in London in 1814.<br>
