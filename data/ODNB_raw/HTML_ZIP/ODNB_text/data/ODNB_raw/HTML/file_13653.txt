<span class="headword">Homer,  Philip Bracebridge</span>  (1765&#150;1838), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and poet</span>, was the tenth son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13651/', "Revd Henry Sacheverell Homer (bap. 1719, d. 1791)")</script>, rector of Birdingbury, Warwickshire, where Philip was born, and Susannah Pitts (<i>d</i>. in or after 1806). He went to Rugby School in 1772, and was distinguished for his classical attainments. He matriculated as a member of University College, Oxford, on 31 October 1781, aged fifteen, and was elected a demy of Magdalen College in 1783 (BA 1785, MA 1788, BD 1804). In 1785 he returned to Rugby, where he was an assistant master for thirty-seven years. He was better regarded for his scholarship than for his abilities at maintaining discipline among the boys, who gave him the sobriquet Philly. He entered holy orders and was a probationer fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, from 1802; he gave up his fellowship in 1806, having married in the previous year. His wife, Caroline, died on 21 February 1815. The terms of his will (20 June 1834) indicate that he remarried. In 1825 he was elected a fellow of Rugby School, being the first of the newly created fellows on the foundation. He died at Rugby on 26 April 1838.<br>
<br>While at Oxford, Homer gained a literary reputation, contributing in 1787 to the miscellany <span class="italic">Olla Podrida</span> edited by his Magdalen contemporary Thomas Monro. A collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Garland</span>, followed in 1788, and his <span class="italic">Anthologia</span> (1789), including verse which he had previously published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, gained the high opinion of Thomas Burgess, who was then a fellow of Corpus Christi College. Some light-hearted aspersions by Samuel Parr on the quality of his verse only temporarily interrupted their friendship. With his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13650/', "Arthur Homer (d. 1806)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13651/', "Homer, Henry Sacheverell")</script>] he completed and prepared for publication the editions of the Latin classics which their brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13652/', "Henry Homer")</script>, had left unfinished. In the 1820s he published two schoolbooks, an edition of the Eton Greek grammar (1825) and a school text on Christian evidences (1827). A manuscript English&#150;Hebrew lexicon which he had compiled was presented by Henry Homer (1819&#150;1911), his son by his second marriage, to the library of Magdalen College, Oxford.<br>
