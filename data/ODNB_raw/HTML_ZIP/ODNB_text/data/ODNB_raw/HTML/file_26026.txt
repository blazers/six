<span class="headword">Somervile <span class="st"> [Somerville]</span>,  William</span>  (1675&#150;1742), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 2 September 1675 and was baptized the next day at Colwich, Staffordshire, the eldest son of Robert Somervile (1647&#150;1705) of Edstone, Warwickshire, and Elizabeth (1644&#150;1742), eldest daughter of Anne (<i>d</i>. 1704) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29849/', "Sir Charles Wolseley (d. 1714)")</script>. He was first educated at Stratford upon Avon and then admitted to Winchester College on 8 August 1690 as founder's kin, his grandmother Anne Fiennes being descended from the sister of William of Wykeham. In 1694 he entered New College, Oxford, matriculating on 24 August, and later became a fellow. On 3 October 1696 he also became a student of the Middle Temple.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in early October 1705 Somervile took up residence at the family home at Edstone and spent the rest of his life there. On 1 February 1708 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1731), daughter of Hugh Bethell of Rise, Yorkshire. His life was taken up with his responsibilities as a country squire both at Edstone and also at Aston Somerville, Gloucestershire, where his family had long had property. Fair, 6 foot tall, and handsome, he established a reputation as a sociable generous man, popular with his neighbours, and skilful and upright as a local magistrate. He observed his commitments as patron to the parishes of Wootton Wawen, near Edstone, and Aston Somerville, and appreciated the loyalty of those who worked for him, as is evident in the plaque to his servant, Thomas Malbone (<i>d</i>. July 1718), at Aston Somerville, and in the epitaph at Wootton Wawen to his butler James Boeter who died in January 1719 after a hunting accident.<br>
<br>Somervile had two major interests, writing poetry and hunting. His first major work written by 1708 was &#145;The Wicker Chair&#146;, a lively recollection by the character of a Vale of Evesham farmer of his exploits at Robert Dover's Cotswold Games. Like the drafts of many of his poems, the text circulated in manuscript before being published, with revisions, as <span class="italic">Hobbinol, or, The Rural Games</span>, a burlesque dedicated to Hogarth, in 1740. Other early poems reflected his whig sympathies, typical being his 1712 tribute to the duke of Marlborough when the ministers of Queen Anne removed him from all his offices. His first published poem was <span class="italic">The Two Springs, a Fable</span> (1725). The title of his second published work, <span class="italic">Occasional Poems, Translations, Fables, Tales, &amp;c</span> (1727) indicated the variety of his output.<br>
<br>Somervile's major poem was <span class="italic">The Chace</span>, published in 1735 and dedicated to Frederick, prince of Wales. In four books of blank verse he conveyed the excitement and dangers of the chase as well as its place in history. This poem was followed less successfully with <span class="italic">Field Sports</span> in 1742. Dr Johnson was grudging in his comments on Somervile as a poet, saying that he &#145;set a good example to men of his own class&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Poets</span>, 36.6), but Somervile was at his best when writing with vitality and enthusiasm about a topic he knew well, especially if it conveyed his love of the countryside. His occasional poems have a genuine but mannered control, whereas in his fables and tales, the moral tends to be laboured.<br>
<br>Somervile's poetry brought him into contact with other writers. He developed a lengthy literary relationship with Allan Ramsay, the Scottish poet who admired his works. He encouraged William Shenstone and Richard Jago. He exchanged ideas about literature and landscape gardening with Lady Luxborough, Bolingbroke's half-sister, who lived nearby at Barrels, Ullenhall, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Somervile's hunting exploits were well known in the locality. He disapproved of coursing, but he took an active part in hunting, his favourite horse Old Ball being used three days a week during the season. His kennels included twelve couples of beagles, six couples of fox-hounds, and five couples of otter-hounds. Such an establishment cost money, and Somervile was beset with financial problems during his years at Edstone. The income from his estates amounted to &pound;1500 a year but he had to provide an annuity of &pound;600 for his widowed mother who lived to the age of ninety-eight and died a month before him. By 1730 he was so much in debt (and had no children to inherit his property), that he arranged that his friend and cousin, James, thirteenth Lord Somerville of the Scottish peerage, would underwrite him financially with a reversion of his estates after his death.<br>
<br>On 5 September 1731 Somervile's wife died and was buried at Wootton Wawen. &#145;My House is now a House of Mourning&#146;, he wrote to Lord Somerville  (BL, Add. MS 44885A). His financial position did not improve, and his kind nature did not help. In September 1734 he was owed more than &pound;1000 by his Aston Somerville tenants. By 1737 he felt he was growing too old for field sports, but he continued to circulate poetic compositions and his translation of Voltaire's <span class="italic">Alzire</span> was well received. He was still well-respected locally, two hundred attending a dinner in his honour when he was sixty-five.<br>
<br>Somervile died at Edstone on 17 July 1742 and was buried on 20 July alongside his wife in the chantry chapel of the church at Wootton Wawen. An epitaph composed by him marks the stone. Shenstone most aptly summarized the feeling of his friends, much of the expression being later used by Dr Johnson:<blockquote>Our old friend Somervile is dead! I did not imagine I could have been so sorry &hellip; I can now excuse all his foibles; impute them to age, and to distress of circumstances &hellip; For a man of high spirit, conscious of having (at least in one production) generally pleased the world, to be plagued and threatened by wretches that are low in every sense; to be forced to drink himself into pains of the body in order to get rid of the pains of the mind, is a misery &hellip; I loved him for nothing so much as his flocci-nauci-nihili-pili-fication of money. (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 55&#150;6)</blockquote>
