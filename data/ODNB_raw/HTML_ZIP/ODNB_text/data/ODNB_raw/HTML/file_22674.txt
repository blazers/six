<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powle,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 18 October 1630 at Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, the second son of Henry Powle (<i>d</i>. 1646), landowner, of Shottesbrooke and his wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of Matthew Herbert of Monmouth. Sir Richard Powle MP was his elder brother. Powle matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 16 December 1646 and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 11 May 1647, being called to the bar on 31 May 1654.<h2>
<a name="Oppositionpolitician"></a>Opposition politician</h2>In 1657 Powle succeeded his uncle, William Powle, at Quenington, Gloucestershire, and that same year he purchased the manor of Williamstrip from his brother Richard. In 1659 he married the Hon. Elizabeth Newport (1627&#150;1672), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20038/', "Richard Newport, first Baron Newport")</script>. They had one daughter, Katherine, who married Henry Ireton, son of the regicide. Powle's two Gloucestershire manors gave him an interest in the parliamentary borough of Cirencester for which he was returned in the Convention of 1660. His only speech of note occurred on 9 July when he opposed the established religion according to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, an early indicator of his sympathy for a broader church. Powle was elected FRS, probably in 1663 (he was expelled in 1685). He was not returned in the 1661 election. In 1667 he had the reputation of a gambler and a rake, and in 1670 he was removed from the Gloucestershire bench, probably because of his reluctance to enforce the <span class="roman">Conventicle Acts</span>, although he was reinstated the following year.<br>
<br>Powle was returned to parliament again at a by-election for Cirencester on 3 January 1671. He made at least one speech during the session, on 22 March 1671, over the fining of juries, and acted as a teller and chair of several select committees. Powle really began to make his mark as an opposition speaker during the 1673 session, peppering his speeches with a detailed knowledge of parliamentary precedents. As Bishop Burnet put it, &#145;Powle was very learned in precedents, and parliament journals, which goes a great way in their debates&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.84). In 1673 Powle particularly opposed the king's declaration of indulgence, favouring a temporary parliamentary indulgence for protestant dissenters, and arguing on 10 February &#145;that the king could not dispense, much less suspend, the laws in being&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Edward Dering</span>, 115). On a related matter, Powle was a keen supporter of the bill preventing the growth of popery (the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>), even suggesting on 21 March 1673 that supply legislation be delayed so that this bill could be completed.<br>
<br>Parliament was summoned to meet again on 20 October 1673, and on the eve of the session Sir William Temple thought Powle a leader of a moderate group of MPs whose aims were to safeguard religion and end the war with the Netherlands. Powle thwarted the court's plan for an immediate prorogation on the 20th and proceeded to move for an address that the duke of York's marriage with Mary of Modena might not be consummated. Parliament was prorogued later that day for a week, and when the new session began on the 27th Powle was again at the forefront of the opposition. On 30 October he opined that &#145;when money is given, or any good thing done, still popery spoils all&#146;  (Grey, 2.195&#150;6). He continued to stress the danger from popery and the grievance of the standing army before parliament was again prorogued on 4 November 1673.<br>
<br>When parliament reconvened in January 1674, Powle was again at the head of the attack on the court, and especially the conduct of the dukes of Buckingham and Lauderdale. On 13 January he spoke of &#145;a pernicious design to alter the government &hellip; these councillors having brought us to the brink of destruction&#146;  (Grey, 2.239&#150;40), and moved for an address that Lauderdale be removed from the king's presence for ever. On the 14th he supported moves to have Buckingham stripped of all the offices he held during royal pleasure. He was less forward in promoting the case against the earl of Arlington, arguing that what was done should be &#145;just and regular&#146;  (ibid., 2.323&#150;4). He described the war against the Dutch as hanging &#145;over our heads like a comet&#146;  (ibid., 2.334&#150;5). He supported a general test bill to distinguish between protestants and papists and a habeas corpus bill, but described the Lords' bill for regulating the trial of peers as likely to set them up as kings should it pass.<br>
<br>The parliamentary session which began in April 1675 saw Powle return to the attack on ministers, especially Lauderdale. Despite claiming &#145;an unwillingness to accuse great men&#146;  (Grey, 3.41&#150;2), on 26 April, he nevertheless supported the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Danby. Other targets for Powle included the danger from France, pensioners, and Lauderdale again (who remained in power). Powle was critical of the king's advisers, believing that there was a design to rule without parliament, and that there were those whose &#145;boundless ambition makes them hate parliaments&#146;  (ibid., 3.132).<br>
<br>Powle continued his opposition in the next session. On 20 October 1675 he supported a bill for the royal children to be educated as protestants. On the 21st he made the point about royal finances: &#145;it seems prodigy to him, that having no war, and such a revenue, there should be such debts&#146;  (Grey, 3.318). On the need for a supply for a shipbuilding programme, he thought money should not be voted for all the ships requested because then there would be no need to summon parliament, and &#145;the prospect of the coming of a parliament keeps things in order&#146;  (ibid., 3.331).<br>
<br>In 1677 the earl of Shaftesbury thought Powle &#145;doubly worthy&#146;, but Powle did not endorse Shaftesbury's contention that the fifteen-month prorogation of parliament to February 1677 constituted a dissolution. He was not, however, willing to support the grant of a supply until grievances had been redressed. He was perturbed by the misuse of previous grants of supply, complaining on 21 February that money was &#145;not laid out for the purpose it was given&#146;  (Grey, 4.126&#150;7), and on 26 March argued for the need to formulate a system of alliances which would secure &#145;the reduction of the French power to an equality with their neighbours&#146;  (ibid., 4.310&#150;11).<br>
<br>When parliament sat again in January 1678, Powle's speech on the 29th encapsulated the case for a restrictive grant of supply: &#145;whilst we give small sums, there will be still recourse to parliaments for more, but giving of great sums will make parliaments useless&#146;  (Grey, 5.23&#150;5). He then argued for redress of grievances before money was granted for the king's foreign policy. On 4 February he defended the right of the Commons to advise the king on foreign policy, and in March consistently pressed for more information on the king's foreign policy and for a war with France. Following a short adjournment in May 1678 he continued to resist a grant of supply without redress of grievances, arguing on 1 June, &#145;I think it can never be suitable to our trust to give money and leave men's minds unquiet as to the growth of popery&#146;  (ibid., 6.48&#150;51). On 8 June he summed up the frustration of the Commons with Charles II's foreign policy: &#145;we desired a war, and we have a peace. We desired to lessen the power of the French king, and we make peace to greaten him&#146;  (ibid., 6.76&#150;7).<br>
<br>In the last session of the Cavalier Parliament Powle was one of a number of MPs associated with Lord Arlington and Prince Rupert who were encouraged to attack Lord Treasurer Danby, probably in Powle's case because of his ambition to secure a place on the Treasury commission. Initially he was sceptical of the Popish Plot, noting on 6 November 1678 his belief that &#145;this plot has come in by the connivance of the government&#146;  (Grey, 6.154). However, he was soon supporting a whole raft of opposition policies for safeguarding the state and the protestant religion, including the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> depriving Catholics of their parliamentary seats, and raising the militia as an alternative to a standing army, which he hoped to see disbanded. He defended the former courtier and now MP Ralph Montagu on 19 December, perhaps partly to protect his own contacts with the French ambassador, Paul Barillon, which had been begun via Montagu and which subsequently led to him receiving &pound;500 from Barillon for his opposition to the court. He then helped to promote Danby's impeachment.<h2>
<a name="Expedientsnotexclusion"></a>Expedients not exclusion</h2>On 11 February 1679 Powle was re-elected to parliament for Cirencester, and three days later he was defeated at East Grinstead where he stood on that part of the Sackville interest espoused by the dowager countess of Dorset. Following Charles II's initial refusal to accept Edward Seymour as speaker, Powle was actually nominated, though not chosen, as an alternative on 8 March. On 19 March he wanted the journals inspected and a report on the events of the previous session laid before the house for the benefit of new MPs. On 1 April he opposed an investigation into the army, wishing to see the troops disbanded quietly, and the punishment of those that counselled raising them. On 7 April he was seated on petition at East Grinstead, but did not choose between his two seats before the end of the parliament. In the middle of the session, on 21 April 1679, Powle was one of a group of former members of the opposition who were admitted to the privy council. The duke of York was encouraged by this move regarding Powle &#145;as a man of honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 1.31). The new privy councillors, however, were now placed in the position of being royal spokesmen in the Commons, but without the full support of the king. Powle thus faced a difficult time being heard in the house, particularly when arguing for a supply to be granted to the king. In the debate on excluding the Roman Catholic duke of York from the throne on 11 May 1679, he argued for limitations to be placed on a royal successor, not for exclusion, which he voted against.<br>
<br>Powle's first wife having died on 28 July 1672, following the end of the parliamentary session he married, by a licence of 28 June 1679, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1687), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6609/', "Lionel Cranfield, first earl of Middlesex")</script>, and the widow of Richard Sackville, fifth earl of Dorset. They had no children. The king dissolved parliament in July 1679, and on 19 August Powle was re-elected for Cirencester. Despite being married to a Sackville, he came bottom of the poll at East Grinstead. In December 1679 Barillon thought him &#145;a man fit to fill one of the first posts in England; he is very eloquent and able&#146;  (Dalrymple, 1.338). Charles II's refusal to allow the new parliament to meet led to Powle's resignation from the privy council on 31 January 1680. When parliament eventually met in October 1680 he was again an unsuccessful candidate for the speakership. He was probably a moderate exclusionist, being appointed to draw up the second <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>, but not speaking for it. He was a manager of the impeachment of Lord Stafford in December 1680, summing up on the 4th &#145;in a vehement oration&#146; on the &#145;Jesuitical doctrine of holding it not only lawful but meritorious to murder an heretic king&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.229&#150;30). He also supported the <span class="roman">Comprehension Bill</span> and the impeachment of Lord Chief Justice Scroggs, but he appeared to be losing his influence to the more ardent exclusionists.<br>
<br>Elected for both Cirencester and East Grinstead in February 1681, in the week-long Oxford parliament Powle spoke on 24 March 1681 in favour of &#145;expedients&#146; over exclusion. After the accession of James II, Powle stood at Cirencester in March 1685, and was easily defeated. He retained his seat on the Gloucestershire bench, but was absent from the county when the &#145;three questions&#146; were asked concerning the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> and penal laws. In September 1688, however, the earl of Sunderland recommended Powle as a court candidate for New Windsor.<br>
<br>Powle had been in contact with The Hague before the invasion of William of Orange in November 1688. Together with Sir Robert Howard he travelled to the prince's camp at Windsor on 16 December 1688, and after a long audience carried a letter back from the prince to the common council of London, which disapproved of James II's return to the capital and ensured that the authorities took precautions to secure the city for William. Powle took the chair of the meeting summoned by William of all the members of Charles II's parliaments on 26 December 1688 in order to find a method of calling a &#145;free parliament&#146;. Powle clearly impressed in this role, the Dutch ambassador, Van Citters, describing him as a &#145;man of excellent understanding and probity&#146;  (Schwoerer, 136).<h2>
<a name="Speakerofthehouse"></a>Speaker of the house</h2>Powle was elected to the Convention Parliament for New Windsor on 11 January 1689, and was chosen speaker on the 22nd. There was an attempt to have him removed from the speakership by overturning his election for New Windsor, but it was confirmed by the house without a division on 2 May. Powle was appointed on 14 February 1689 to the privy council, was named master of the rolls on 13 March, and reappointed on 14 June. He had been made a bencher of Lincoln's Inn on 13 May of the same year. As well as presiding over the succession debates, Powle presented the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span> to William and Mary on 16 December 1689.<br>
<br>In the 1690 election Powle was returned for Cirencester, but despite support among some whig back-benchers he was not re-elected to the chair. On 26 April he supported the <span class="roman">Abjuration Bill</span> because it was aimed only at those people employed in the government, and &#145;they who are to act ought to be zealous in it&#146;  (Grey, 2.85&#150;6). Unseated on petition on 25 November 1690, Powle died on 21 November 1692, after a few days' illness, and was buried at Quenington. His great collection of precedents, parliamentary journals, and manuscripts on English history was split up, eventually part of it finding its way into the Lansdowne collection, and part to the Bodleian Library.<br>
