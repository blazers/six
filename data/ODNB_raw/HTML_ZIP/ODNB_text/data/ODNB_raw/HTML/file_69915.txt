<span class="headword">Ross,  John</span>  (1728/9&#150;1807), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born probably in Scotland; nothing further is known of his early life. In 1762, after working for seven years as an overseer in a London printing house, he joined Rhys Thomas in the latter's two-year-old printing business in Carmarthen. Their imprints of 1763 refer to a &#145;new printing-house&#146; in Lammas Street (Heol Awst). On 17 April 1764 Ross married Jane Edwards in St Peter's Church, Carmarthen; a son, Daniel, was baptized on 6 January 1765 and buried on 13 February of the same year. By March 1768 Ross was a member of Heol Awst Welsh Independent Chapel, of which he was subsequently a trustee; &#145;Mr Ross's father&#146; also subscribed to chapel funds between 1769 and 1772.<br>
<br>Rhys Thomas moved to Llandovery in 1764, leaving Ross to quietly revolutionize the Welsh book trade as the first printer in the area to serve an appropriate apprenticeship. He announced that he had procured from London a printing press and new types, including, it transpired, a Hebrew font. Initially he employed Evan Thomas to oversee the Welsh publications but in due course Ross learned the language himself. The quality of his presswork and his business acumen set standards which signalled the death knell of the non-professional printer in Wales. In 1772 he moved from Lammas Street to Priory Street, but in 1781 he returned to Lammas Street, to a site now commemorated with a plaque. Ross printed about 400 books in English, Welsh, and Hebrew on an infinite variety of subjects, designed to edify, inform, or merely entertain; they ranged from broadside ballads to folio bibles. He rarely published himself and, when he did so, it tended to be by subscription. Usually the onus of publication lay on the author, with Ross's efficient book distribution network within Wales and extending to English towns, notably London and Shrewsbury, facilitating the process.<br>
<br>The size of Ross's editions was impressive; an unprecedented 8600 copies were issued of the first edition of his most famous publication, the 1770 Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span>, with a commentary by Peter Williams. He was the printer of two early Welsh periodicals, the fortnightly <span class="italic">Trysorfa Gwybodaeth</span> (1770) and the quarterly <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Repository</span> (1795&#150;6). Jobbing printing was lucrative; the professional classes, tradesmen, and gentry in the prosperous town of Carmarthen and in the neighbouring counties were avid clients. Cardiganshire quarter sessions records for 1786 reveal that Ross would also provide a Welsh translation service. His shop was well stocked with new and secondhand books, binding materials, stationery, and patent medicines. By 1787 he had a circulating library. A highly respected figure in Carmarthen, Ross was one of the two sheriffs of the borough in 1785.<br>
<br>Ross died in October 1807, aged seventy-eight. The business was taken over by Ann Scott, who had married Walter Scott, a market gardener, in 1776. She is described in her obituary as John Ross's daughter but she is more likely to have been his sister, since she was 107 when she died in September 1842 and, according to the 1841 census, she was born outside the county. In March 1808 she disposed of &#145;the entire stock of a large Printing Office&#146;.<br>
