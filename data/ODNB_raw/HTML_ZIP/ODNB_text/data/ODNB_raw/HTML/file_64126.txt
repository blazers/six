<span class="headword">Mortlock,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1755, <em>d.</em> 1816), <span class="occ">banker and mayor of Cambridge</span>, was born at Cambridge and baptized at St Edward's Church there on 17 October 1755, the only son of John Mortlock (<i>d</i>. 1775), a prosperous woollen draper and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davy (<i>d</i>. 1800). He is often referred to as John Mortlock III to distinguish him from his father and grandfather. On 3 October 1776 he married Elizabeth Mary Harrison (1756/7&#150;1817), daughter of Stephen Harrison, a wealthy Presbyterian grocer, and they had ten children.<br>
<br>Mortlock became the first banker to the town and university of Cambridge and achieved rapid success and popularity, for his business was conducted &#145;liberally and cheerfully&#146;  (Gunning, 1855, 1.128) and answered a real need. He entered politics in 1780 as a would-be reformer and supporter of the fourth duke of Rutland, and was rewarded with the receivership of the Cambridgeshire land tax, which he relinquished on his unopposed election as MP for Cambridge in April 1784. His parliamentary career was brief and inglorious; he narrowly avoided censure in 1786 for tampering with a list of commissioners of the land tax, and was equivocal in his allegiance to the administration, causing Rutland to write to Pitt in September 1786: &#145;Personally he weighs not a feather; but he has decided influence in the town of Cambridge, which I am apprehensive he will throw into the hands of the duke of Bedford&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Cambridgeshire</span>, 74).<br>
<br>For part of 1788 Mortlock was mayor, member of parliament, and recorder of the borough, but he resigned the last two of these positions in favour of Rutland nominees, and afterwards continued to enjoy the patronage of the family and of government ministers, while managing Cambridge with its small electorate of freemen as a pocket borough in the Pittite interest. His recompense was a lucrative office as receiver-general in the Post Office, and other preferments for his sons. His power depended on his mastery of the town corporation into which he had bought his way in 1778, becoming alderman in 1782. His election as mayor in 1785 was followed by alterations in the manner of appointment; he held office thirteen times in the following thirty years, turn and turn about with his sons and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. Besides his wealth he employed legal tactics ruthlessly and altered by-laws at will to transform an oligarchy into a dictatorship. His use of corporation funds and leases as well as charitable trusts was self-serving. During the danger of the French wars he was strongly conservative and did little to prevent the persecution of his former allies, the dissenters of Cambridge, although he was usually an able magistrate and checked food riots in 1795. He died at his town house in Cambridge, after a short illness, on 7 May 1816, a landed gentleman, owner of Abington Lodge and a substantial fortune possibly worth &pound;120,000. He was buried at St Edward's, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Mortlock's reputation suffered greatly when Liberal and municipal reformers of the 1830s delved into events of the previous fifty years. The learned town clerk of Cambridge, Charles Henry Cooper, blamed him for most of the corruption in local affairs, remarking that, had he wished, Mortlock could have made his own footman MP for Cambridge. He became the villain of modern studies by Helen Cam and Sir Lewis Namier. His rule, however, &#145;although despotic was not inefficient&#146;  (Gray, 54), and he was probably no worse a grafter than others of his time. His probity as a banker was not undermined and attempts to bankrupt him for political ends always failed. Henry Gunning, that staunch and argumentative whig, who differed markedly in politics, none the less maintained a long and cordial friendship with him. &#145;&#147;Without <i>influence</i>,&#148; he would say, &#147;which you call <i>corruption</i>, men will not be induced to support government though they generally approve of its measures&#148;&#146;  (Gunning, 1855, 1.127).<br>
