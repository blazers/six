<span class="headword">Wickwane,  William  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1285), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, is of unknown origins, and his early career is wholly obscure. Although he never held an advanced academic degree, his status as a <i>magister</i> has led to the suggestion that he may have been a student at the University of Paris (or possibly Oxford). Whether he was the author of the theological compilation or &#145;Memoriale&#146; with which he is credited by John Bale, bishop of Ossory, is, however, extremely uncertain. Nor, as far as is known, had he any experience of administrative service on behalf of the English crown. It is accordingly somewhat surprising that Wickwane already held the important dignity of chancellor at York Minster by January 1264, the month in which he was also admitted to the rectory of Ivinghoe in Buckinghamshire. As chancellor and (from at least 1268) canon and prebendary of Newbald, he emerges from Archbishop Giffard's archiepiscopal register as a somewhat truculent member of the York Cathedral chapter, often at odds on financial matters with his superiors. Nevertheless, only two months after Giffard's death in April 1279, Wickwane was elected in his place by an overwhelming majority (eighteen votes out of twenty-one) of the chapter. He lost no time in travelling to Italy where the pope, Nicholas III, set aside the capitular election, and then by papal authority provided Wickwane to the archdiocese of York before consecrating him archbishop at Viterbo on 26 August. The temporalities of his see were restored on 28 October.<br>
<br>Immediately on his return to England, Wickwane began to display a provocative&#151;and characteristic&#151;tenacity in defence of what he took to be the canonical privileges of the church of York. His insistence on having his primatial cross carried before him while travelling through the province of Canterbury from Dover to his enthronement at York, which took place on Christmas day 1279, caused something of a national scandal and permanently embittered his relations with Archbishop Pecham. More dangerously still, and as early as 12 December 1279, Wickwane launched what seems to have been the first full-scale programme of provincial visitation that the northern English church had ever experienced. In 1281 the archbishop deliberately asserted his metropolitan authority over his suffragan see of Durham. On being prevented by force from visiting the cathedral chapter there on 25 June, he had his chair set up in Palace Green and concluded an uncompromising sermon by excommunicating Bishop Robert de Insula as well as Prior Richard of Claxton and his monks, later placing Durham under an interdict. Two years later he took the opportunity of Robert de Insula's death to renew his attempts to conduct a visitation of the Durham chapter, this time <i>sede vacante</i>. On 3 July 1283 he dismounted at the cathedral, only to find the church closed against him yet again. Wickwane was forced to leave Durham unceremoniously, after an even more dangerous assault on himself and his retainers than the one he had endured in 1281.<br>
<br>Despite ceaseless endeavours to find a solution to the complex legal issues at stake, Wickwane's attempts to exercise jurisdictional superiority in the diocese of Durham therefore ended in humiliating failure for him. The election of Antony (I) Bek to the bishopric of Durham in July 1283 introduced a new and powerful personality into the confusions of the situation, but the archbishop was now too enmeshed in litigation against the monks of Durham to contemplate a compromise. As his register demonstrates, he was also restlessly active in visiting religious houses and churches within his own diocese. In late 1284 he finally decided to seek justice against the obduracy of the Durham Cathedral chapter by visiting the curia in person. Reported to have arrived at the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny in Burgundy by December 1284, he became fatally ill not long afterwards and returned to Pontigny to die on 26 or 27 August 1285. Miracles were later alleged to have been worked at his tomb there, but in the north of England, Wickwane left a more ambiguous reputation, as an archbishop who was &#145;lean, harsh and niggardly&#146;, but to those who knew him best also &#145;just in judgement and most tender in conscience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Lanercost</span>, 19).<br>
