<span class="headword">Colepeper,  Thomas</span>  (1637&#150;1708), <span class="occ">soldier and engineer</span>, was born on Christmas day 1637 in Kent, possibly in either Dover or Hackington, the son of Sir Thomas Colepeper (1598&#150;1643), governor of Dover Castle, and his wife, Barbara (1599&#150;1643), daughter of Robert Sidney, first earl of Leicester. Sir Thomas was Lady Colepeper's second husband; her first was Thomas Smythe, first Viscount Strangford, with whom she had other children. It was to the Smythe household that Thomas went when in 1643 he was orphaned. What formal education he received seems to have been at home, where he was trained as a steward for his family estate at Stanford. Whatever the actual nature of his education, Colepeper possessed a formidable intellectual curiosity, and in later life he displayed remarkable energy in scientific pursuits.<br>
<br>With his half-brother Philip, second Viscount Strangford, the young Colepeper joined the royalist underground. From 1658 he claimed to be a colonel in the royal service, though he may never have actually been commissioned. Nevertheless, the council of state knew of his royalist connections, and in July 1659 ordered his appearance. He was arrested at Canterbury and sent as a prisoner to the Gatehouse in Westminster in early August. The council granted him bail of &pound;3000 on 26 September 1659.<br>
<br>Like so many who devoted themselves to the Restoration, Colepeper received meagre rewards. In 1663 he claimed a grant from the Loyal and Indigent Officer's Fund, but whether he ever received one is unknown. By this time he was much in need of assistance, for his attempt to ally himself with a noble family had gone awry. About 1662 he eloped and married Frances (1638&#150;1698), the youngest daughter of Lord Frescheville, who then refused to make her a settlement. Father and son-in-law were ultimately reconciled, but Frescheville never gave his daughter a fortune. The &pound;300 annuity he granted her after his death in 1682 would have done little to rescue the struggling Colepeper, who had, by 1675, already sold the family estate. In any event Lord Frescheville's own estate was so heavily encumbered that it is doubtful that the annuity was regularly paid.<br>
<br>Colepeper's embarrassed circumstances compelled him to live by his wits and the exercise of his scientific imagination. In February 1665 he and several others petitioned the crown for a grant of marshland they planned to drain on the Lancashire coast. By September 1665 he had gained a foothold in the royal service as a gun-founder. His scientific interests led to his election to the Royal Society on 28 May 1668, not long after the crown granted him a patent for an iron hearth. In 1675 he was appointed engineer in the Ordnance office at an annual salary of &pound;100; his work in the Ordnance office led to the invention of a grenade launcher in 1681.<br>
<br>Colepeper's fertile mind was, unfortunately, joined with a hot temper, and he wrecked his career as a military engineer by a rash act in the summer of 1685. On 9 July, standing near James II's bedchamber door, he met William Cavendish, fourth earl of Devonshire. The two men had a troubled relationship, inspired primarily by Colepeper's unreasonable belief that his wife should have inherited lands that Lord Frescheville sold to Devonshire's family shortly before his death. Bitter lawsuits ensued. Added to this was political animosity: Colepeper rudely demanded to know what &#145;an excluder&#146; was doing at court. Devonshire, while whiggishly inclined, had in fact not been an avowed exclusionist, and gave Colepeper the lie. The result was a brawl conducted in full view of the king. Colepeper was not only bested by Devonshire, who knocked him to the floor, but also imprisoned by the king's command. On 20 July he was tried in the court of the verge of the palace, and received a savage sentence: the loss of his right hand, a fine of &pound;1000, and life imprisonment. Under the circumstances, the royal order to sack him from the Ordnance office nine days later was no more than a minor inconvenience. Luckily, he did not suffer the full rigour of the law. His wife threw herself into his cause, and, with the help of the earl of Danby, secured his pardon. In December 1686 he petitioned James for the restoration of his place, though without success. In April the following year he had another altercation with Devonshire, who challenged him in the king's presence. Colepeper had learned his lesson, and refused the challenge; Devonshire was arrested and ultimately fined &pound;30,000, which he never paid, and was in his turn pardoned by William III. The choleric earl assaulted Colepeper yet again in 1697, though in this case neither man was prosecuted. Colepeper, now in his sixtieth year, was, however, badly beaten.<br>
<br>By the time of Devonshire's last attack, Colepeper was declining into a destitute, if frenetic, old age. His penchant for invention never left him, but it never rewarded him with anything like the fame and riches he thought his due. In May 1688 he received a patent for a &#145;new water engine&#146;. During William III's reign he proposed a comprehensive scheme which he guaranteed would make the king Europe's most powerful sovereign by, among other things, allowing royal naval vessels to be used as fire ships without actually burning, making all of the king's fortresses impregnable, and raising, at his own expense, a force of 12,000 men for the crown. None of these boons was taken up. Following his wife's death in December 1698 and the loss of her annuity&#151;if it was paid at all&#151;he sank further into poverty.<br>
<br>But Colepeper was fundamentally an optimist, and he never ceased hoping for better things. He compiled many volumes of evidence to prove his right to the Frescheville title, which availed him nothing, but reveal his quarrelsome and petulant nature. Only two months before his death he was writing to the king of Prussia, offering his services and claiming to have &#145;discovered&#146; longitude. He died in his rented lodgings in Westminster in December 1708, and was buried at St Margaret's Church there on 28 December.<br>
