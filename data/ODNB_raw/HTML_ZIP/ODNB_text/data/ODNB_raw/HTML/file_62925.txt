<span class="headword">Boyle,  William</span>  (1853&#150;1923), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 4 April 1853, at Dromiskin, co. Louth; his father may have been Christian Boyle, a farmer. He was educated at St Mary's College, Dundalk, subsequently joining the civil service in London, and acting as an excise officer until 1914. <span class="italic">A Kish of Brogues</span> (1899) was a collection of tales and poems based on the country life of his childhood. On 25 April 1905 the Abbey Theatre in Dublin staged his first play, <span class="italic">The Building Fund</span>, which dealt with rural life in a realistic and unromanticized manner. Many critics of the Abbey policy at the time, which was faulted for being either too poetic or for making a travesty of Irish character (as was said of J. M. Synge's <span class="italic">The Playboy of the Western World</span>), welcomed Boyle's familiar style and accuracy. Boyle was, in fact, drawing upon an older set of conventions than that which the Abbey (founded 1904) was seeking to form for itself; his models were those of Victorian melodrama and farce in their Dublin manifestations: stereotypical characters, stock situations, humorous brogue, broad comedy, and sentiment. Yeats thought his work vulgar and yet recognized its commercial appeal, a consideration of some importance for a theatre heavily dependent on the goodwill of its patron, the English heiress, Annie Horniman. Nevertheless Yeats &#145;nearly had a fit&#146; when Boyle told him he wrote poetry, but relaxed when he was reassured that it was merely comic verse  (Hogan and O'Neill, 59).<br>
<br>Boyle returned to the Abbey with <span class="italic">The Eloquent Dempsey</span> (20 January 1906) and repeated his popular success with this study of small-town politics and patriotism. It was followed by <span class="italic">The Mineral Workers</span> (20 October 1906), dealing with the conflict between modernization and tradition in the countryside, as a young industrialist seeks to set up a smelting plant in an area exclusively given over to farming, and after much opposition, some of it politically motivated, who triumphs. Once again, Boyle found more favour with the popular reviewers than he did with Yeats and the Abbey directorate. When the controversy blew up over Synge's <span class="italic">Playboy</span> (January 1907) Boyle withdrew his three plays from the Abbey repertory in protest against the staging of a play which, in his view, calumniated Irish character. Lady Gregory, who distrusted Boyle as much as Yeats did, commented on his departure: &#145;that's a rotten branch gone&#146;  (Hogan and others, 183).<br>
<br>Boyle returned, however, with another play of rural realism, <span class="italic">Family Failing</span> (28 March 1912), which was less well received. After retiring from his post in London he returned to his native place to build a house on the spot where the family one had been. He became a magistrate, which effectively estranged him from the very people he had hoped to become closer to on his return. Out of sympathy with the Easter rising of 1916, he went back to England where he died at his home, 16 Ardbeg Road, Dulwich, London, on 6 March 1923, survived by his wife, Maud. A nationalist who distrusted Yeats and the Irish literary movement, and a realist who yet could not tolerate the Irish country people being (as he put it) &#145;misrepresented&#146;, his emotional tensions were the source of his dramatic energy and his irascibility.<br>
