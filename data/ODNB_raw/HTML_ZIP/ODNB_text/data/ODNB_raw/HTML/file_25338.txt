<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shepherd, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1760&#150;1840), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 6 April 1760, the son of Henry Shepherd, a jeweller and toy maker of 85 Cornhill, London, a friend of Garrick, and a dabbler in poetry. Shepherd attended the Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1773 to 1774, and was then at a school at Chiswick, probably that of Dr William Rose. In July 1776 he was entered at the Inner Temple, where he became pupil of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24280/', "Serjeant Charles Runnington")</script>, who married his sister Anna Maria in 1777. On 23 November 1781 he was called to the bar. On 1 January 1783 he married Elizabeth White (<i>d</i>. 1833), daughter of John White of Hick's Hall, St Sepulchre, Middlesex, who was pronounced &#145;fine and figety&#146; by Sir Walter Scott.<br>
<br>Shepherd went the home circuit, and soon acquired a considerable practice both on circuit and in the court of common pleas. He earned the praise of lords Mansfield and Kenyon. Thomas Erskine became his travelling companion during the vacations. From about 1790 he began to suffer from progressive deafness. In 1793 he declined the dignity of king's counsel, but he was created serjeant-at-law in Easter term 1796, and in the following Trinity term became king's serjeant. On the death of Serjeant Cockell he rose to be king's ancient serjeant.<br>
<br>As regent, the prince of Wales made Shepherd his solicitor-general in June 1812, and in December 1813 he was appointed solicitor-general to the crown following a warm recommendation from Lord Ellenborough. He was knighted on 11 May 1814, and in the spring of 1817 was made attorney-general. From 11 April 1814 to June 1819 he sat for Dorchester in parliament, where he was effective in the transaction of legal business on behalf of Lord Liverpool's administration, and in rebuffing opposition attacks. In the law courts his chief cases were the prosecution of the radical publishers James Watson (in June 1817) and Richard Carlile, the latter for publishing Paine's <span class="italic">Age of Reason</span>.<br>
<br>By common consent Shepherd was a sound lawyer, who but for his deafness would have risen higher in his profession. He refused the two offices of chief justice of the king's bench and of the common pleas in 1818, partly owing to his deafness, and partly because he had made up his mind not to accept a judicial office that involved the trial of prisoners. The objection did not apply to the post of lord chief baron of the court of exchequer in Scotland, which he held from June 1819 to February 1830. While in Scotland he sat on the bench with Scottish judges to assist them with the application of English law in treason trials arising out of the radical insurrection there in 1820. He was raised to the privy council on 23 July 1819.<br>
<br>After suffering some initial suspicions from Scottish lawyers, Shepherd became popular in Edinburgh society, and was a close friend of Sir Walter Scott, who said of him:<blockquote>There is a neatness and precision, a closeness and truth in the tone of his conversation, which shows perfect good humour &hellip; with a little warmth of temper on suitable occasions. His great deafness alone prevented him from being Lord Chief Justice. I never saw a man so patient under such a malady. (Lockhart, 8.152)</blockquote>With his friend William Adam, lord chief commissioner of the jury court, Shepherd presented in 1834 to the Bannatyne Club, of which they were members, a volume of the ragman rolls (1291&#150;6). Shepherd was also a member of the Blair-Adam Club, of which William Adam and Sir Walter Scott were leaders, and joined in the club's annual excursions. Scott once commented that Shepherd had &#145;too much English figettiness about him for rocks and precipices perpetually afraid that rocks would give way under his weight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 6.466).<br>
<br>Ill health forced Shepherd to resign his post in 1830, when he retired, amid his own regrets and those of his Edinburgh friends, to a cottage at Streatley in Berkshire, where he owned a small property. For the last three years of his life he was blind. He died at Streatley on 3 November 1840, and was buried in the churchyard there, where a monument was erected to his memory.<br>
<br>Shepherd's widow died at Hyde Park Terrace, London, on 24 March 1833, aged seventy-four. Their son Henry John Shepherd (1783?&#150;1855), bencher of Lincoln's Inn (KC 1834), recorder of Abingdon, and commissioner of bankrupts, was author of <span class="italic">A Summary of the Law Relating to the Election of Members of Parliament</span> (1825; 3rd edn, 1836) and of <span class="italic">Pedro of Castile</span>, a poem (1838). He died at Caversham, near Reading, on 21 May 1845  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 44, 1855, 108). His wife, whom he married on 11 April 1808, was Lady Mary (1777&#150;1847), the second daughter of Neil Primrose, third earl of Rosebery, and the author of three philosophical treatises [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58699/', "Shepherd, Lady Mary (1777&#150;1847)")</script>]. Sir Samuel's niece Sarah Garay Thomas was the first wife of his intimate friend John Singleton Copley (afterwards Lord Lyndhurst).<br>
