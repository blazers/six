<span class="headword">Campbell,  Lorne Maclaine, of Airds</span>  (1902&#150;1991), <span class="occ">army officer and wine merchant</span>, was born at The Airds, Argyll, Scotland, on 22 July 1902, the eldest of the three sons of Colonel (Ian) Maxwell Campbell of Airds (1870&#150;1954), army officer and wine merchant, and his wife, Hilda Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wade. He came from a family steeped in military service: he was the eleventh, with one exception, in a line of army officers. His great-great-grandfather had raised the grenadier company of the 98th, later the 91st, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. His father served with the 8th battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders throughout the First World War, commanding it as a Territorial Army unit thereafter. His uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32263/', "Vice-Admiral Gordon Campbell")</script> won the VC in 1917 for sinking a U-boat from a badly damaged Q-ship; he was later Conservative MP for Burnley from 1931 to 1935.<br>
<br>Campbell was educated at Dulwich College, where he was captain of school in 1920&#150;21. From there he went as a postmaster (scholar) to Merton College, Oxford. He excelled in sports, and was awarded a half-blue for athletics. He missed a rugby blue through injury. He graduated with a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1925. Meanwhile he had joined the 8th battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (then under his father's command) as a Territorial Army officer, in 1921. After leaving Oxford he joined the family firm of wine shippers. It was said of him that &#145;he had the finest palate for wine in Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). On 27 December 1935 he married (Amy) Muriel Jordan Campbell (1905&#150;1950), only daughter and second of the four children of Alastair Magnus Campbell of Auchendarroch. They had two sons.<br>
<br>By the outbreak of the Second World War, Campbell was second-in-command of the 8th battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. The battalion was sent to France in 51st Highland division as part of the British expeditionary force. When the Germans launched their blitzkrieg in May 1940, the 51st were ordered to move across France to recapture the Somme bridgeheads from the Germans, but the overwhelming success of the German army on all fronts made this task impracticable. The Argylls, with the rest of 51st division, were ordered to make their way to Le Havre and, under French command, launch counter-attacks. Conflicting orders in the face of a relentless German onslaught led to much confusion. Nevertheless Campbell managed to reach Le Havre with two companies of his highlanders, without losing a single man. The rest of 51st division were taken prisoner at St Val&eacute;ry-en-Caux. Campbell was awarded a DSO for his conduct during the campaign.<br>
<br>Evacuated from Le Havre, Campbell was given command of the 7th/10th battalion in the newly formed 51st Highland division, which he took to north Africa to fight in the western desert. He was awarded a bar to his DSO at the battle of El Alamein in October&#150;November 1942. When the British Eighth Army advanced to Tunisia, his battalion was given the task of crossing an enemy minefield and an anti-tank ditch at Wadi Akarit in order to form a bridgehead. After forming up in darkness and traversing an offshoot of the wadi (a dry, rocky watercourse) in order to attack, they accomplished their objective and took 600 prisoners. The following day Campbell's position was under constant heavy bombardment but, although wounded in the neck by shrapnel, he inspired his men to such an extent that all attacks were repulsed and the bridgehead held. Exposed in full view of the enemy he rallied his men and, although painfully wounded, he stood in the open to direct the fight under close fire from German infantry. His VC citation concluded with the words: &#145;It is the opinion of the Army Council that in all the long and glorious annals of the British Army the conduct of this officer has seldom been equalled and never surpassed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>In 1943 Campbell was promoted brigadier, and was given command of the 13th infantry brigade, which he then led through Sicily, the Anzio landings, and much of the Italian campaign. During the absence of the general officer commanding, he commanded 5th division for several weeks. He was then posted to the British army staff in Washington (1944&#150;5), where he was made an officer of the US Legion of Merit. At the end of the war he was sent to Germany on an official mission to report on the possibilities of establishing the Boy Scout movement there, to replace the unwholesome ideology of the Hitler youth movement. He had always been an enthusiast for scouting, although later he declined the offer of high office in the organization.<br>
<br>Following demobilization Campbell returned to the wine trade, becoming a liveryman of the Vintners' Company, and eventually its master. He served on the committees selecting wine for the royal cellars and for official hospitality, and was instrumental in setting up the qualification &#145;master of wine&#146;. For his services on official bodies he was made an OBE in 1968.<br>
<br>Although much of his life had been lived in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, Campbell's final years were spent in Scotland, where his recreations were fishing and gardening. An exceptionally modest man, he declined prestigious appointments and the possibility of a seat in parliament. He was religious, gentle, sociable, and unselfish. A fellow officer described him as the &#145;nicest man in Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). He died at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Edinburgh, on 25 May 1991, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his two sons, his wife, Muriel, having predeceased him in 1950. A memorial service was held on 21 June 1991 at Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh.<br>
