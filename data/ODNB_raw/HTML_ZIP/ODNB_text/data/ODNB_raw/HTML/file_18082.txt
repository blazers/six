<span class="headword">Marmion,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1216<span class="mult">x</span>18), <span class="occ">baron and justice</span>, was the son of Robert Marmion of Tamworth, Staffordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Hugues, count of Rethel, near Rheims. The death of his father, about October 1181, made the younger Robert a leading baron in the English midlands, with important estates also at Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire and Berwick in Sussex, and at Fontenay-le-Marmion in Normandy (Calvados). Identity of name makes it impossible to tell whether it was father or son who witnessed a number of Henry II's charters in Normandy in the 1170s, but it was probably Robert junior who in January 1178 sat on a judicial assize at Caen. After his father's death he was active in the king's service in England; he is recorded as a justice in the <i>curia regis</i> at Melksham, Wiltshire, on 25 January 1184, while in 1187 he headed a circuit of eyres in the west midlands, during which he also imposed a tallage on the counties visited. Between Easter 1185 and Michaelmas 1189 he was sheriff of Worcestershire.<br>
<br>In common with many sheriffs Marmion lost his shrievalty at the accession of Richard I, and in 1190 had to promise a fine of &pound;1000. This was subsequently commuted to 700 marks, which he paid in Normandy. In 1191 he was in Wales, paying &pound;300 to the garrison of Carmarthen Castle. But in 1194 he joined Richard I in Normandy, and was still there in 1197, when he swore on the king's behalf to observe the treaty between Richard and the count of Flanders, and in July 1198. At some point he vowed to go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but about 1200 gave &pound;500 angevins instead to the Norman abbey of Barb&eacute;ry, of which his father ranked as second founder. Marmion seems to have remained in Normandy during the early years of John's reign; he witnessed one of that king's charters at Caen on 7 August 1203, and on the same day was granted the lands of such of his own men as had joined the French.<br>
<br>When Normandy was lost in 1204, Marmion returned to England, but his eldest son remained in France, and this, combined with Marmion's obvious determination to retain his position in both realms, seems to have prompted John's mistrust. Although Marmion acted as a justice in the king's court when it sat at Worcester in August 1204, and in 1205 was entrusted with the custody of a royal hostage, thereafter he appears in the record of government only as paying scutages and clearing old debts. The latter may have been achieved by borrowing, for at his death Marmion was indebted to two London Jews, owing at least &pound;170. In 1210 three of his knights went on the king's Irish expedition, but Marmion does not appear to have gone himself. Estranged from John, he subsequently joined the baronial rebels. At about the end of 1215 the king ordered that Tamworth Castle be demolished; the order was not carried out, but at least some of Marmion's lands were confiscated. On 25 September 1216 it was ordered that the manor of Quinton, Gloucestershire, be restored to him, and early in November he was offered a safe conduct to enter into negotiations, but there is no evidence that he accepted it. He died, probably at Scrivelsby, some time before 9 May 1218.<br>
<br>Robert Marmion married twice, first to Maud de Beauchamp, and second, before about 1200, to Philippa (<i>d</i>. in or after 1221), whose surname is unknown. There were children of both marriages, though, confusingly, the eldest son of each was named Robert. In the provision that he made for his sons Marmion showed himself determined to keep his cross-channel lordship in being. The elder Robert remained in Normandy after 1204. The younger Robert came to England with his brother William, who became a secular clerk. Their father provided for both his younger sons, giving lands by charter to Robert in Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire, and Sussex, and in Lincolnshire and Sussex to William, whom he also presented to two Warwickshire churches during the civil war. There can be little doubt that these grants were intended to shape arrangements subsequently made for the Marmion inheritance, when on 15 May 1218 the younger Robert (who had also been a rebel against John, and was captured at the battle of Lincoln) promised &pound;500 for Tamworth and his father's lands, to be held until England and Normandy were reunited. If his elder brother Robert came into Henry III's allegiance, the lands were to pass to him, except for those that their father had already granted to the younger Robert and to William. In the event the elder Robert did return to England, and for a while reunited almost all his father's Anglo-Norman lordship.<br>
