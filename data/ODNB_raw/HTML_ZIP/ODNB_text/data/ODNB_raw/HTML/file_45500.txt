<span class="headword">Collins,  An</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1653), <span class="occ">poet</span>, is known only as the author of <span class="italic">Divine Songs and Meditacions</span> (1653), the sole source of information about her. This volume is in part a spiritual autobiography, but specific details about her life are either lacking, only briefly or cryptically disclosed, or woven into a generic pattern that makes it difficult to separate person from persona.<br>
<br>Collins's poems describe afflictions in conventional though often moving fashion, as Job-like storms of anguish, and winters preceding spring-like recoveries, but there are also more personal references. She alludes to her external unattractiveness, bodily imperfections, and physical incapacity in metaphors that suggest that she may have been disfigured by an illness such as smallpox and immobilized by the loss or paralysis of a limb, perpetually housebound as a result of some early &#145;weakness&#146;. That she was able to turn retirement into creative uses by practising her intellectual, spiritual, and poetic powers in &#145;morning exercise&#146; apparently did not erase her lifelong sense of physical vulnerability, disability, and shame, recurrent themes in her lyrics.<br>
<br>Collins gives no information about her family: she offers her poems to &#145;some neare Kindred&#146;  (Collins, ed. Gottlieb), but her strongest ties are to a community of saints constituted by shared religious beliefs rather than blood relations. She never mentions a husband or intimate companion, roles abrogated by God, the one truly essential &#145;Sweet presence&#146; in her life, who instigates and supports her &#145;calling&#146; to poetry and accepts her poems as &#145;the offspring of my mind&#146;.<br>
<br>Frequent references throughout Collins's volume to flowers, rocks, and caves, and &#145;the beauty of the Land&#146; suggest a country rather than city life, but one filled with tension and strife. The typical struggle between the godly and the ungodly appears in her portraits of a community filled with dissension and slander, often aimed at her, and a countryside ravaged by civil war. Presumably with the parliamentarians in mind, Collins identifies those who ruin the land by forced oaths, confiscations, and innovations in religion and government as dangerous enemies of truth and liberty, but she also criticizes the kind of libertinism often associated with the court, comments favourably on the aims of the &#145;Good Old Cause&#146;, and supports what is often thought of as the radical challenge of continuing to reform the Reformation.<br>
<br>Collins's religious beliefs are difficult to pin down exactly. One of the poems in the volume, &#145;The Discourse&#146;, is a relatively unexceptional primer of traditional protestantism, and Collins's profound sense of sin has led some critics to call her a Calvinist, but her lack of emphasis on election and predestination and bracing descriptions of the human inclination to goodness make this doubtful. And although she is occasionally critical of &#145;Novelties&#146; in religion, she displays affinities with some of the sects of the time that were attuned to a personal inner light, apocalyptic, aware of being shunned by respectable secular society, and ever ready to combat publicly the enemies of the godly.<br>
<br>Collins gives voice to the pains of her triple affliction&#151;as a physically disabled person, one of the godly living &#145;where profanenesse did abound&#146;, and a woman traditionally constrained to silence and a limited range of activities&#151;but challenges these pains and constraints in metrically inventive songs and meditations that are &#145;memorandums&#146; of praise to God and powerful assertions of her own role in typological and contemporary history.<br>
