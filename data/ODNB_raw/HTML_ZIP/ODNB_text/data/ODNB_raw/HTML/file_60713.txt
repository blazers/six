<span class="headword">Cromwell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1610/11), <span class="occ">parliamentary diarist</span>, was the third son of Gregory Cromwell, first Baron Cromwell (<i>d</i>. 1551), and Elizabeth, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset")</script>, and widow of Sir Anthony Oughtred. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6769/', "Thomas Cromwell")</script>, Henry VIII's minister, was his grandfather. He attended St John's College, Cambridge, and in August 1580 married Katherine, daughter of Thomas Gardner of Coxford. Cromwell sat in five of Elizabeth's parliaments, for Fowey (1571), Bodmin (1572), Preston (1584), and Grampound (1586 and 1589), seats often available to the well connected. He is best remembered for the diaries he kept for the sessions of 1572, 1576, 1581, and 1584, now in Trinity College, Dublin. These reveal a love for parliamentary process and the details of legislative business at a key time in the development of the English parliament. Where they can be checked against other sources, Cromwell's diaries are shown to be an accurate, if at times incomplete, record of bill proceedings, peppered with details of measures and often quite extensive reports of debates. In 1572 he took pains to report the Commons' actions against Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, and Mary, queen of Scots; the remaining diaries consist largely of bill proceedings.<br>
<br>Cromwell was intimately acquainted with the workings of parliament. He was an active committee man, being named to almost a hundred committees considering a wide range of matters. In the last two weeks of March 1585, for example, he was appointed to the Commons' committees dealing with cloth making, malt, apprentices, church ministers, leases of land, copyhold lands in Ely, and a bill concerning a debtor. On occasion he notes that his afternoon committee work necessitated his absence from the floor of the house. He seems to have had a special interest in electoral returns, being entrusted with reporting the work of the relevant committees, and in legal matters. In 1585 Cromwell was one of three members chosen to argue before the lord chancellor, unsuccessfully, that members' privilege of freedom from arrest should extend to being unavailable to receive subpoenas.<br>
<br>According to his own diaries, and the journal of Elizabeth's parliaments compiled from a number of original sources by Sir Simonds D'Ewes in the seventeenth century, Cromwell made several speeches to the house. In 1572 he spoke in favour of bringing minstrels under the terms of the vagabonds bill and, in 1581, on the subject of children born to foreigners. In 1587 Cromwell made a well-received motion thanking the queen for her response to the Commons' petition urging the execution of Mary Stuart. He was no sycophant, however. When a leading government minister urged caution after an MP moved that the whole house should attend the queen to request Norfolk's execution in 1572, Cromwell &#145;misliked to have any delay from so necessarie a motion&#146;  (Hartley, 1.314). He supported Paul Wentworth's 1581 motion for a public fast, a move considered by the queen to be a breach of her royal prerogative. Cromwell also objected to the queen's imprisonment of MPs in 1587 for promoting a radical alternative to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>.<br>
<br>Cromwell's will requested &#145;that noe pompe or sumptuousnes be used in about or by reason of my buriall, beinge not willinge to have vanities continued for me after my deathe whereto I have beene too much subiect in my lifetime&#146;. He was one of those moderate puritan MPs with a compromising marriage, for his brother-in-law was a Jesuit priest. Nevertheless, his marriage to Katherine Gardner was evidently a happy one. His will repeatedly acknowledged his &#145;beloved&#146; wife, and required his children's obedience to her if they hoped to receive their inheritances. Cromwell assisted the privy council on local matters in Norfolk, where he retired to property near King's Lynn. His land dealings and agricultural activities were complicated, troubled, and rather unsuccessful. This, he claimed in his will, was due to his preoccupation with the affairs of his brother and nephew, the second and third barons Cromwell. He died between February 1610 and April 1611.<br>
