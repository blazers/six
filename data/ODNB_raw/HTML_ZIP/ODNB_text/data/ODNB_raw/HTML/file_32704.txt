<span class="headword">Dampier <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Whetham]</span>, Sir  William Cecil  Dampier</span>  (1867&#150;1952), <span class="occ">scientist and agriculturist</span>, was born in South Hampstead, London, on 27 December 1867, the only son (he had one sister) of Charles Langley Whetham, manufacturer, and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of Thomas Dampier, glove manufacturer, of Yeovil. A shy boy, of indifferent health, he was educated for the most part privately. He became interested in science and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was awarded an exhibition and a scholarship in his second and third years. He obtained first classes in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1888&#150;9), was Coutts Trotter student (1889), and Clerk Maxwell scholar (1893). Influenced by J. J. Thomson he undertook research at the Cavendish Laboratory which earned him a college fellowship in 1891. He was a college lecturer in physics (1895&#150;1922), tutor (1907&#150;13), senior tutor (1913&#150;17), and remained a fellow for the rest of his life, an active member of the finance and estates committees and an ardent supporter of the Cambridge Preservation Society. An attempt in 1918 to represent Cambridge University in parliament as an independent Conservative proved unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In 1901 Whetham was elected fellow of the Royal Society and in the following year he published a treatise, <span class="italic">Theory of Solution</span>, which was for some time the standard textbook. He wrote a number of papers on ionic velocities and on electrolysis. Although college duties and other pursuits gradually diverted him from research he retained an interest in the work of other scientists, publishing <span class="italic">The Recent Development of Physical Science</span> (1904) and <span class="italic">History of Science</span> (1929), both of which went into a number of editions.<br>
<br>In 1897 Whetham married Catherine Durning, daughter of Robert Durning Holt, shipowner, of Liverpool. They had one son and five daughters, two of whom became scientific research workers. Whetham and his wife became absorbed in the history of his forebears, among whom were Thomas and William Dampier, bishop and buccaneer respectively; they published a biography of the roundhead Colonel Nathaniel Whetham in 1907 and, led on to a general study of heredity and its influence on society, they followed this with <span class="italic">The Family and the Nation</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">Heredity and Society</span> (1912).<br>
<br>Whetham inherited the Dampier family property in 1916 and farmed the land on the Hilfield estate in Dorset between 1918 and 1926. He specialized in the making of cheese and took part in the investigation of the possibilities of extracting lactose from whey. So he came to his last and abiding interest in agricultural economics.<br>
<br>Whetham was co-opted a member of council of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1921, received its gold medal in 1936, and became a vice-president in 1948. In 1925&#150;42 he was a member of the Agricultural Wages Board, in 1933&#150;51 a development commissioner, and in 1938&#150;9 chairman of the land settlement committee. He was chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture machinery testing committee (1925&#150;33) and of the committee for the preservation of grass and other fodder crops (1933&#150;9), and acting chairman of the rural industries bureau (1939&#150;45). In 1931 he was knighted for his services to agriculture, and changed his name to Dampier. In the same year he became first secretary of the Agricultural Research Council which he was able to establish on sound lines with freedom to engage directly in research before resigning in 1935 when he felt the technical side of the work had gone beyond his range of knowledge. He remained a member of the council until 1945 and served on many of its committees.<br>
<br>A shrewd and kindly man who found his long life &#145;interesting and amusing&#146;, Dampier was always willing to give his services in the public welfare. He died at the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 11 December 1952, a few months after his wife.<br>
