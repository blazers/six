<span class="headword">Onslow,  Richard</span>  (1527/8&#150;1571), <span class="occ">lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was a younger son of Roger Onslow of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and his first wife, Margaret, daughter of Thomas Poyner. His elder brother, Fulk (<i>d</i>. 1602), was clerk of the parliaments in the reign of Elizabeth I. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1545, aged seventeen, at the instance of Sir Nicholas Hare, and called to the bar some time before 1554. Although he was expelled from the inn in 1556, with seven others, after an outbreak of disorder, this did not prevent him from being elected a bencher in 1559 in advance of reading. Several copies survive of his first reading, given in the autumn of 1562 on the Henrician statute concerning final concords (32 Hen. VIII c. 36). By this time he was a member of parliament, having been elected for Steyning in 1558 and Aldeburgh in 1559. In 1559 he married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1599), daughter and heir of William Harding of Knowle, Surrey; they would have seven children. In 1560 he became a member of the council in the marches of Wales, in 1561 clerk of the council to the duchy of Lancaster, and in 1562 a justice of the quorum for his home county. These positions, which he retained until his , did not prevent his practice at the bar, and in 1561 he argued successfully for the plaintiff in the earliest known reported case on the doctrine of consideration, when it was held by the queen's bench that an exchange of conditional promises could constitute a binding contract.<br>
<br>In 1563 Onslow was chosen recorder of London, and occupied that office until he became solicitor-general in 1566. In 1563 he was again elected member for Steyning, and in 1566 for the city of London as well as for Steyning, serving for the latter. It was in this last parliament that he was elected speaker of the House of Commons, though not without difficulty. Onslow attempted to disqualify himself on the grounds that the speakership was incompatible with his office as solicitor-general, which bound him not only to the queen but also to attendance on the Lords; but he was elected after a division (eighty-two against seventy). Well might he seek to be excused, for it proved to be a turbulent session, during which the burning issues were the succession to the crown and the queen's marriage. On 25 November 1566, after the suppression of a <span class="roman">Bill for Regulating the Succession</span>, Onslow read to the house the queen's command to stay all proceedings touching the crown, which she considered &#145;very unmeet for the time and place, and certainly very dangerous to the common quietness of all her good subjects now here assembled&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lost Notebooks</span>, 125&#150;6). This interference with freedom of speech&#151;a liberty that Onslow, perhaps with deliberate circumspection, had omitted to claim at the beginning of the session&#151;had been approved by a meeting of judges, and (according to Dyer) was observed by the house. Nevertheless, on 2 January 1567, when the parliament ended, Onslow made a two-hour speech during which he eulogized hereditary monarchy and daringly urged the queen to marry without delay. This earned a further royal rebuke to the Commons for busying themselves in matters that did not concern them. The incident did not harm Onslow's career, for in 1569 he was promoted from the office of solicitor-general to the lucrative attorneyship of the court of wards and liveries.<br>
<br>Onslow is said to be the author of &#145;Arguments proving the queene's majestie's propertye in the sea landes and salt shores&#146;, which survives in several manuscripts and was edited for publication by J. W. Pycroft in 1855. However, his promising career was cut short by the plague. He died on 2 April 1571, still in his early forties, from a pestilential fever caught while visiting his uncle at Shrewsbury, and was buried in St Chad's, Shrewsbury, on 7 April. His will mentions lands in Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire, Kent, Middlesex, Shropshire, Surrey, Sussex, Warwickshire, and Wiltshire, and a house in the Blackfriars, London, which his widow had as part of her jointure. Among his bequests were a standing cup and cover for the earl of Leicester, to whom he was &#145;most bounden&#146;, and a gilt bowl for Lord Burghley. His second son (and eventual heir), Sir Edward Onslow (<i>d</i>. 1615), was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20793/', "Sir Richard Onslow (d. 1664)")</script> and ancestor of the earls of Onslow.<br>
