<span class="headword">Lewis, Sir  (John) Herbert</span>  (1858&#150;1933), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born at Mostyn Quay, Whitford, Flintshire, on 27 December 1858, the only son of Enoch Lewis (1812&#150;1885), merchant and shipowner (great-nephew of Thomas Jones of Denbigh, Methodist leader, 1756&#150;1820), and his wife, Catherine Roberts (<i>d</i>. 1868), of Plas Llangwyfan, Denbighshire. He was educated at Denbigh grammar school, briefly at McGill University (Montreal), privately with Dr E. Pan Jones, and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he read jurisprudence and graduated with a fourth in 1879. He continued his legal training in Chester and London before he established the Liverpool practice of Herbert Lewis and Davies in 1885. His partner, Alfred Thomas Davies, became the first secretary of the Welsh department of the Board of Education. On 16 November 1886 he married, at the Welsh Presbyterian church, Toxteth, his cousin Adelaide Hughes (1862/3&#150;1895), daughter of Charles Hughes JP, publisher, of Wrexham. After her death he married Ruth Caine (<i>b</i>. 1871/2), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32238/', "William Sproston Caine")</script>, the Liberal MP and temperance advocate, on 8 July 1897. There was a son and a daughter of the second marriage.<br>
<br>Lewis was active in local politics from 1886 and was appointed treasurer of the North Wales Liberal federation. He was elected alderman and first chairman of Flintshire county council in 1889 and took part in implementing the provisions of the <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Act</span> of 1889 and the <span class="roman">Technical Education Act</span> of 1889 in the county. He remained chairman until 1893 and continued his involvement with the county council until 1913.<br>
<br>Lewis entered parliament in 1892 as a Liberal, representing Flint Boroughs until 1906 and Flintshire until 1918, when he was elected the first MP to represent the University of Wales, a seat for whose creation he had campaigned. He held it until his retirement in 1922. A close colleague of David Lloyd George and Tom Ellis, he practised a radical nonconformity which came early to the fore when in the &#145;Welsh revolt&#146; of 1894 he joined Lloyd George, D. A. Thomas (later Lord Rhondda), and Frank Edwards in refusing the Liberal whip over disestablishment of the Church in Wales. A leading figure in the Cymru Fydd (Young Wales) movement that flourished in the final decades of the nineteenth century, he was consistent in bringing a range of Welsh concerns to parliament's attention. His long and persistent campaign to obtain for Wales a share in the museum grants voted annually by parliament led to the establishment of a national museum in Cardiff and a national library in Aberystwyth, and his advocacy, with that of others, achieved status for the library as a place of deposit under the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1911. He was a vice-president of the library from 1907 to 1926 and president from 1926 to 1927. He was also involved in the development of the university colleges in Wales and with others, notably Lord Rendel and Tom Ellis, succeeded in obtaining a royal charter establishing the University of Wales in 1893.<br>
<br>Lewis was appointed junior lord of the Treasury in 1906, parliamentary secretary to the Local Government Board in 1909, and parliamentary secretary to the Board of Education in 1915. At the Board of Education, with its president H. A. L. Fisher, he worked for educational reform, particularly the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> (1918), the <span class="roman">Libraries Act</span> (1919), and legislation concerning teachers' superannuation and educational grants for former servicemen. On leaving parliament in 1922 he was appointed GBE. In retirement he was able to indulge further his lifelong interest in travel, in 1924 revisiting India, where his daughter was involved in missionary work.<br>
<br>Lewis was sworn of the privy council in 1912 and was an alderman of Flintshire county council from 1889 to 1913; he was also constable of Flint Castle, a freeman of the boroughs of Flint and Aberystwyth, vice-president of University College of North Wales, Bangor, an honorary LLD of the University of Wales (1918), deputy lieutenant of Flintshire, and president of the Library Association of the United Kingdom (1920&#150;21), and was awarded the gold medal of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion in 1927.<br>
<br>In June 1925, when visiting Aberystwyth, Lewis slipped and fell into a quarry, seriously injuring his spine. Thereafter he was confined to the family home at Penucha, Caerwys, Flintshire, where he died on 10 November 1933. He was buried at the Calvinistic Methodist cemetery of Ddol Chapel, near Caerwys, on 13 November. His widow, Lady Lewis, who was appointed OBE in 1918 and one of the first women JPs in 1921, survived him.<br>
<br>An obituarist writing in the <span class="italic">North Wales Times</span> (18 November 1933) noted that during his time in parliament Lewis did more constructive work for Welsh institutions than anybody else before or since. Throughout a long career in public service he was consistent and effective in his support of nonconformity, of the Welsh language, and of Wales.<br>
