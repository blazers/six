<span class="headword">Coleman,  William Stephen</span>  (1829&#150;1904), <span class="occ">book illustrator and painter</span>, was born at Horsham, Sussex, and baptized there on 28 August 1836, one of the twelve children of William Thomas Coleman, a surgeon, and his wife, Henrietta Dendy. His sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57879/', "Helen Angell (1847&#150;1884)")</script> became well known as a flower painter. Coleman trained as a surgeon, but never practised. Instead he became interested in natural history and published <span class="italic">Our Woodlands, Heaths, and Hedges</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">British Butterflies</span> (1860), illustrated by himself. He also helped to illustrate other books, mainly on natural history, assisted by his sister Rebecca Coleman. He provided the illustrations for some of J. G. Wood's natural history books including <span class="italic">Common Objects of the Country</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Our Garden Friends</span> (1864), and <span class="italic">Common British Moths</span> (1870), all published by Routledge in a series of shilling handbooks on natural history which were frequently reprinted. Among other books illustrated by Coleman were J. C. Atkinson's <span class="italic">Sketches in Natural History</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">British Birds' Eggs and Nests</span> (1861) and T. Moore's <span class="italic">British Ferns</span> (1861). He also designed the heading for <span class="italic">The Field</span> newspaper.<br>
<br>Coleman painted many watercolour landscapes, which proved very popular. In the 1860s he began to depict young girls. Two of his paintings are in the Victoria and Albert Museum: <span class="italic">Girl, with a Basket of Coral, Seated Near the Shore</span> and <span class="italic">Girl with Shell</span>. He also designed Christmas cards. A member of the management committee of the Dudley Gallery from the beginning, he contributed to the first exhibition there in 1865. He continued to exhibit until 1879, and remained on the committee until 1881. In addition he exhibited at the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours from 1866 to 1899.<br>
<br>In 1869 Coleman entered on a third artistic career: he joined the Copeland factory in the Potteries, and painted china plaques. Later that year he moved to Minton's, in order to work with their famous turquoise colour. Inspired by Japanese prints, his tableware designs included the &#145;Game Plate&#146; and the &#145;Naturalist&#146; set of herbs, shellfish, butterflies, birds, and vegetables, and dessert services with maidens in oriental settings. In 1871 he became head of the new Minton's Art Pottery Studio in Kensington Gore, close to the South Kensington Museum, set up by Herbert Minton to enable eminent artists to paint on porcelain and earthenware. This grew out of the South Kensington Museum porcelain-painting class, where from 1867 to 1870 women students painted Minton tile blanks for the decoration of the grill room at the museum. Among Coleman's most successful designs during his two years at the studio were porcelain plaques decorated with scantily clad or nude young girls, women, and children, a fish bowl decorated with fish and aquatic plants, and circular bottles decorated with plants and birds in turquoise and blue. He also attracted designers such as Christopher Dresser. Although he gave up his position as art director in 1873, he continued to paint on Minton blanks and use the studio kilns until it burnt down in 1875, and he exhibited his Minton designs at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873 and the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Examples of his ceramic works are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. After 1873 he worked as a freelance designer, painter, and illustrator.<br>
<br>Coleman died after a long illness at his home, 11 Hamilton Gardens, St John's Wood, on 22 March 1904, survived by his widow.<br>
