<span class="headword">Cross,  Herbert Shepherd</span>  (1847&#150;1916), <span class="occ">bleacher and landowner</span>, was born on 1 January 1847, at Mortfield, Halliwell, Bolton, Lancashire, the third surviving son of Thomas Cross (1805&#150;1879), a bleacher, cotton spinner, and banker, of Bolton, and his first wife, Ellen, the daughter of Joseph Mann of Liverpool. He was educated at Worksop and Harrow schools and Exeter College, Oxford, and entered the Inner Temple in 1867; however, illness ended his law studies, and he later joined the family business. On 22 June 1870 he married Lucy Mary, the only child of the Revd Shepherd Birley, of the Birleys of Kirkham, Lancashire; the adoption of the name Shepherd in 1884 was a requirement of his father-in-law's will, and concerned his wife's inheritance. Following Lucy's death, in 1891, he married, on 23 January 1895, Patty Penelope, the daughter of James Hortor, gentleman, of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>The three Cross brothers inherited their father's personal estate of nearly &pound;350,000 and formed a partnership to run the Mortfield bleaching interests. Illness removed Alfred (1849&#150;1886), leaving control to Herbert and, principally, James Percival Cross (1843&#150;1906). The Crosses were known for their paternalism, the development of an extensive area of alcohol-free working-class housing, and the provision of public buildings. The bleaching process, with its heavy demand for water, inevitably meant the family had extensive landed interests. In 1884 Herbert added to the land he owned in Bolton the large Hertfordshire estate of Hamel's Park, Buntingford. Later he owned land at Sheen in Surrey.<br>
<br>Behind Cross's move to Hertfordshire&#151;he also acquired a house in Kensington&#151;lay politics. He served on the Bolton school board (1873&#150;81), became a JP (1874) and a major in the Duke of Lancaster's Own yeomanry, and actively supported the Anglican church's education and temperance movements. The Crosses ranked among Bolton's leading tory families, and in 1884 Cross was nominated for one of the town's seats. He was elected in 1885 and remained in parliament until illness&#151;some said differences with his supporters over Chamberlain's programme&#151;led to his retirement in 1906. He spoke in the house seven times, supported his party in the division lobbies, and whiled away parliamentary tedium by playing chess. He was also a member of the Carlton and Junior Carlton clubs. He was reputedly a good constituency member and he did not neglect his base; the Crosses' strength as employers and landlords, particularly in the Victory and Chorley Old Road districts of Bolton, where street names reflected his influence, was combined with generous gifts to the town. Cross's wife, Lucy, was a founder of the Adult Deaf and Dumb Society, and in 1885 she was influential in establishing the Bolton Habitation of the Primrose League. His second wife was also active in the league.<br>
<br>Cross, described at the time of his first marriage as a &#145;gentleman&#146;, and at his death as a &#145;landowner and JP&#146;, illustrates the attraction of rural society to industrialists of the period. At Hamel's Park&#151;purchased from Charles Frederic Villiers MP&#151;he brought up two families, enjoyed farming, fishing, and shooting, and entered into country life. He took an interest in agriculture and the management of his home farm, was a member of Hertfordshire county council, chairman of the Buntingford magistrates' bench, the Braughing council school, and the parish council, and president of the Braughing, Standen, and Puckeridge Nursing Association. On one occasion he arranged for more than a thousand of his Bolton constituents to attend an immense picnic at his Hertfordshire home.<br>
<br>Politics did not end Cross's business career. His participation as chairman in two small mining ventures, on the Gold Coast (1896&#150;1902) and in British Columbia (1898&#150;1901), suggests other interests. However, he was best known as a bleacher. In 1900 Thomas Cross &amp; Co. was the third largest of the fifty-three concerns which merged to form Bleachers Association Ltd, one of Britain's largest industrial companies. A family account credits Cross with the association's inception. To the trade's members the new combine offered reduced competition, less risk, and the opportunity to convert some of their assets. Cross became the first chairman. He was resented for interfering in matters which were the concern of the general managers and, following reorganization in 1904 and 1906, became a nominal chairman, a post he retained until his death.<br>
<br>Cross died from cancer at Hamel's Park on 9 January 1916, and was buried at Braughing parish church on 13 January. In a complex will he settled his estate on his wife, the two sons and a daughter of his first marriage, and the son and two daughters of the second.<br>
