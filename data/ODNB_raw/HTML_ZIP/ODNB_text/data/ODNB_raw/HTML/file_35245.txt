<span class="headword">Noble, Sir  Percy Lockhart Harnam</span>  (1880&#150;1955), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Charles Simeon Noble and his wife, Annie Georgina Noble, was born on 16 January 1880 in India where his father was a major in the Bengal staff corps. He entered the <i>Britannia</i> as a naval cadet in 1894 and spent his midshipman's time in the <i>Immortalit&eacute;</i> on the China station. In view of his subsequent career it seems strange that his captain should notice him in his report as lazy and dull. During his sub-lieutenant's courses Noble was detailed for the naval guard of honour mounted at Windsor for the funeral of Queen Victoria. When the horses which were to draw the gun-carriage bearing the coffin became restive, and later unmanageable, Noble suggested that they be unhitched and the gun carriage drawn by the naval guard of honour, a precedent followed in every subsequent royal funeral. He was appointed MVO.<br>
<br>After service in the battleships <i>Hannibal</i> in the channel squadron and <i>Russell</i> in the Mediterranean, Noble was appointed flag lieutenant to A. L. Winsloe, commanding destroyer flotillas at home. He commanded the destroyer <i>Ribble</i> from 1907 to 1908, when he joined the signal school at Portsmouth and qualified as a signal specialist. A brief appointment to the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i> for Edward VII's visit to Copenhagen was followed by a commission in China as flag lieutenant to Winsloe, and on completion of that duty he returned to the royal yacht as first lieutenant, being promoted commander when he completed the appointment in 1913. In December he joined the <i>Achilles</i>, in the 2nd cruiser squadron, Home Fleet, as executive officer, and three years later was transferred, still as executive officer, to the large cruiser <i>Courageous</i>, flagship of the light cruiser force, Grand Fleet. His promotion to captain came in June 1918 and in October of that year he was made flag captain to Sir Allan Everett in the <i>Calliope</i>, transferring to the <i>Calcutta</i> in 1919. In 1922 he was appointed to the <i>Barham</i> in command and as flag captain to Sir Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair, then commanding 1st battle squadron, Atlantic Fleet. He was promoted CVO in 1920.<br>
<br>Noble's next command (1925) was the <i>Ganges</i>, the boys' training establishment at Shotley, and his experience in this post led to his selection two years later (1927) as the first commanding officer of the <i>St Vincent</i>, a new boys' training establishment being set up at Gosport. This was followed by an appointment as director of the operations division on the naval staff, 1928&#150;9, and his promotion to rear-admiral (1929).<br>
<br>In 1931 Noble became director of naval equipment in the Admiralty and at the end of the following year was selected to command the 2nd cruiser squadron in the Home Fleet, flying his flag in the <i>Dorsetshire</i>, then in the <i>Leander</i>. In 1935 he was brought back to the Admiralty as fourth sea lord where he was successful in obtaining marriage allowances for naval officers. He was promoted vice-admiral while holding this appointment and in 1937 was chosen to command the China station. He was appointed CB in 1932 and KCB in 1936.<br>
<br>Noble's qualities of tact and restraint were continuously called into play during this difficult period in the Far East. The Japanese were engaged in their war with China and frequently made threatening advances to the borders of the British settlements at Hong Kong and Shanghai. Noble managed to prevent any of these threats from developing into outright hostilities, and the skill with which he handled all such incidents brought him many expressions of the Admiralty's appreciation.<br>
<br>In 1939 Noble was promoted admiral, relinquished his command in July 1940, and in February 1941 was appointed commander-in-chief western approaches. It was this command which bore the responsibility for the war against German U-boats, which by that time had established a definite ascendancy in the Atlantic. Setting up his headquarters in Liverpool, Noble set about his task with his usual thoroughness. He realized that special training in anti-submarine warfare was the key to ultimate victory in this campaign, and although he was continuously hampered by a shortage of anti-submarine forces, he laid down the principles of training and also established the group organization of escort forces which was later to pay a high dividend in the Atlantic war. He himself went to sea and flew with Coastal Command so that the crews knew that he understood their problems and there were forged &#145;links of mutual confidence of inestimable value&#146;. By the time he left the command, the British anti-submarine forces had reached a degree of organization and training which left his successor, Sir Max Horton, a firm and lasting foundation on which to wage successful warfare.<br>
<br>On leaving Liverpool in the autumn of 1942 Noble was sent to Washington as head of the British Admiralty delegation. He saw the switch from the defensive to the offensive in the naval war, and much of the credit for the smooth co-operation both in planning and in operations between the British and American navies was owed to Noble for the qualities of firmness, tact, and sound sense which he brought to the deliberations of the combined chiefs of staff. For his services in Washington he was appointed GBE in 1944 and was made a commander of the American Legion of Merit in 1946.<br>
<br>Noble was twice married: first, in 1907, to Diamantina Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of Allan Campbell. Their son, Commander Sir Allan Noble, on retiring from the navy entered parliament and was minister of state for foreign affairs in 1956&#150;9. In 1913 Noble married, secondly, Celia Emily (<i>d</i>. 1967), daughter of Robert Kirkman Hodgson; they had a son.<br>
<br>In 1943 Noble was appointed first and principal naval aide-de-camp to George VI. He retired from the navy on 16 January 1945 and was made rear-admiral of the United Kingdom. He received the grand cross of the royal order of St Olaf for his services to the Royal Norwegian Navy. He died at his home, 66 Ashley Gardens, London, on 25 July 1955.<br>
