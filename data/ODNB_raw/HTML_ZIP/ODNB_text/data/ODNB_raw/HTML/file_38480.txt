<span class="headword">Urquhart,  Francis Fortescue, of Urquhart</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Sligger]</span>  (1868&#150;1934), <span class="occ">bachelor don</span>, was born on 1 September 1868 at 21 Malagnou, Geneva, the third (second surviving) son and fifth (last) child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28017/', "David Urquhart (1805&#150;1877)")</script>, diplomatist and writer on international affairs, and his wife, Harriet Angelina Fortescue (1824&#150;1889), also a writer. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9938/', "Chichester Fortescue, Baron Carlingford")</script>, was a father figure during Francis Urquhart's youth: the name Fortescue was added at Carlingford's request when he died childless in 1898.<br>
<br>Urquhart's childhood home was in Montreux, with summers at the Chalet des M&eacute;l&egrave;zes, which his father had built in 1865, 1000 metres above St Gervais-les-Bains, in the French Alps. His mother became a Roman Catholic in 1877, and he was educated in that tradition at Hodder Place near Stonyhurst (1879&#150;80), Beaumont College in Old Windsor (1881&#150;6), and Stonyhurst College (1886&#150;9). In 1889 he took an external London BA in classics. Urquhart entered Balliol College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner in 1890: he won the Stanhope historical essay prize, took a first in modern history (1894), and was elected to a tutorial fellowship in 1896. The first Catholic tutor in Oxford since the Reformation, and a pious one at that, his presence did much to reconcile conservative Catholics with the university; but he did not seek converts, which helped to settle the suspicions of conservative Anglicans.<br>
<br>Urquhart lived in Balliol for nearly forty years, holding office as junior dean (1896&#150;1907), domestic bursar (1907&#150;19), and dean (1918&#150;34). A conscientious but uninspiring tutor, his interests were more in art and architecture than literature or history, and he made no contributions of his own to historical scholarship. He took little part in university affairs except the development of the Oxford Catholic chaplaincy&#151;he was instrumental in the appointment of his friend R. A. Knox as chaplain in 1926. Nevertheless, he became one of the best-known and most warmly remembered dons of his time. His main role, recalled L. E. Jones, &#145;was social, not pedagogic &hellip; he appeared to have endless leisure for loitering in the Quad by day and gossiping in his rooms by night&#146;  (Jones, 33). Late in the evening during term time his rooms above Balliol's back gate became an informal salon for undergraduates of all sorts to mix and talk. In vacations he often took a chosen few with him touring, and every summer except 1915&#150;18 he invited groups of a dozen or so to stay with him at his father's chalet, which became known as the Chalet des Anglais. He had first taken a reading party there in 1891; in 1896 he bought the chalet from his elder brother, David Urquhart (1855&#150;1928). It burnt down in 1906 while he was on a trip round the world, but he had it rebuilt. Between 1891 and 1931, when his health failed, he had about 300 chalet guests for a week or two of morning reading and afternoon mountain walks. About half were Balliol undergraduates, including C. V. Connolly, L. P. Hartley, J. S. Huxley, F. S. Kelly, M. Harold Macmillan, and W. T. Monckton, but other colleges were also well represented&#151;by T. S. R. Boase and R. J. G. Boothby (both Magdalen); R. H. S. Crossman, W. G. Hayter, J. P. R. Maud, J. H. A. Sparrow (all New College); and Q. McG. Hogg (Christ Church).<br>
<br>Urquhart had a slim, athletic frame, blue eyes, and a handsome, smooth face with heavy, slightly pouting lips; his hair was thick and curly&#151;light brown in youth, white later. The nickname Sligger, by which he was generally known after about 1892, was derived from &#145;sleek one&#146; through &#145;slicker&#146;. He liked handsome young men, and photographing them, but was probably celibate. Only one special relationship is evident, with Stephen Hewett (1893&#150;1916), whose letters from the trenches he edited for publication. Walter Pater may have used Urquhart as the model for some features of the subject in <span class="italic">Emerald Uthwart</span> (1892). Anthony Powell, a pupil of Urquhart's, placed his recurrent character Sillery in a setting based on Urquhart's salon, but denied otherwise drawing on him.<br>
<br>Urquhart died of lung disease at the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 18 September 1934, and was buried in Wolvercote cemetery three days later after a solemn requiem mass at the church of St Aloysius. He left most of his &pound;15,000 English estate to Balliol. In 1959 lord Lyon king of arms accepted that the chiefship of the clan Urquhart had been vested in him (1928&#150;34), and had passed on his death to his distant American cousin Wilkins Fisk Urquhart of that ilk (1896&#150;1976). Urquhart bequeathed the Chalet des Anglais to his Balliol friend R. A. B. Mynors. At the close of the twentieth century it was still being used for undergraduate reading parties.<br>
