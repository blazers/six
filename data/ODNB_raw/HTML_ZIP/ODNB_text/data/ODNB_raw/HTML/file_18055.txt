<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Margoliouth,  Moses</span>  (1815&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Hebrew scholar and convert from Judaism</span>, was born in Suwa&#322;ki, Poland, son of a prosperous local merchant named Gershon Margoliouth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1852), apparently originally surnamed Epstein or Epszteyn. In 1834 Moses Margoliouth married Chaja Goldberg (1818&#150;1870), daughter of writer and historian Ber Goldberg (1799&#150;1886) and his wife, Rachel (<i>d</i>. 1874), and a daughter, Miriam, was born in the following year. Margoliouth left Poland alone in 1837, arriving at Liverpool on 28 October. On his very first day in the city he met a missionary from the Institute for Enquiring Jews, who offered him lodging, employment, and a Hebrew <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Moses Margoliouth was baptized into the Church of England on the following Good Friday, 13 April 1838.<br>
<br>Margoliouth was obviously a young man of learning and potential, and he was soon the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of an anonymous benefactor, who from January 1840 paid for his studies at Trinity College, Dublin, which he completed in summer 1843. In that year he published his first book, <span class="italic">The Fundamental Principles of Modern Judaism Investigated</span>, printed at Chester and dedicated to Dr Alexander M'Caul (1799&#150;1863), the Christian missionary to the Polish Jews and Hebrew professor at King's College, London.<br>
<br>Margoliouth returned to Liverpool, to his old position at the Institute for Enquiring Jews, and he was joined in his house at 5 Juvenal Street by his wife and daughter, newly arrived from Poland. On 30 June 1844 he was ordained into the Church of England and granted the curacy of St Augustine's, Everton, Liverpool. But within a few days a better offer came from Bishop Lindsay of Kildare, who gave him the rectorate of Glasnevin, on the outskirts of Dublin. A son was born just then, named Charles Lindsay, so the position could not have come at a better time. On 23 October 1844 Margoliouth took office, and spent the next three years in an undemanding position that gave him plenty of opportunity to carry on with the scholarly work that led to numerous publications throughout his life. Margoliouth also became a freemason and published a monthly magazine, the <span class="italic">Star of Jacob</span> (January&#150;June 1847), but it folded after six numbers.<br>
<br>The life of a provincial Anglican clergyman in Ireland was clearly not enough for Margoliouth, so he sent his wife to live with her newly arrived parents, resigned his living, and in July 1847 set sail for the Holy Land, arriving at Constantinople in March 1848 and finally Jerusalem, where he went at once to see the protestant bishop of Jerusalem, Samuel Gobat (1799&#150;1879). He travelled throughout Palestine until May 1848 and returned to Liverpool, becoming early the next year curate in the parish of St Catherine Tranmere on the Wirral. He fell out with the vicar and resigned in the autumn, although his children remained in the care of a family in the parish while he went to London to supervise the publication of his three-volume <span class="italic">History of the Jews in Great Britain</span> (1851).<br>
<br>In September 1851 Margoliouth was made curate of St Bartholomew's, in Salford. On 4 January 1853 his daughter, Miriam, married William Parker, the son of a local farmer: they and their children emigrated to New Zealand in 1859 and Margoliouth's son Charles followed them a few years later. In May 1853 he resigned his curacy once again, taking a similar post at St Chad's, Wybunbury, Cheshire. This too ended unhappily, and in February 1855 he became curate in Great Coates, near Grimsby, but only for a few months.<br>
<br>Margoliouth spent a year and a half abroad in 1856&#150;7. His wife Chaja, from whom he had separated about 1847, had moved to Paris with her parents in 1852, leaving the children behind. Margoliouth paid a return visit to his native town in Poland, visiting his mother and his brother Hershel, whose son Gershon would himself come to England twenty years later. Upon his return to Britain early in 1857 Margoliouth became curate in Braintree, Essex. But by July 1858 he had gone again, in order to apply himself to another of his unfinished projects, a new edition of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>.<br>
<br>Margoliouth spent the next three years living at 25 Great Russell Street, London, working on his edition and writing a semi-autobiographical novel entitled <span class="italic">The Curates of Riversdale</span>. In September 1861 he took on another curacy at Wyton, near Huntingdon, and remained for about a year, afterwards taking temporary positions until in 1864 he was given a very satisfying post as assistant minister in the East End parish of St Paul's, Haggerston, where he remained for about ten years. He then moved across London to a curacy at St Paul's, Onslow Square, living at 22 Pelham Crescent in South Kensington. It was while serving in this post that he met a childless widow named Sarah Golding St Osyth Smith (1826&#150;1889), and they were married on 14 October 1874 (his first wife having died in 1870). Two years later Margoliouth was offered a proper living at Little Linford, Buckinghamshire, near Newport Pagnell, and he was inducted as vicar on 30 January 1877 and installed with his wife in a new purpose-built house. The following April he had the pleasure of baptizing there his nephew Gershon (now George), who had recently arrived in England after studying in Germany. Margoliouth died at the Portland Hotel, Great Portland Street, London, on 25 February 1881, attended by his nephew George at the end. He was buried at Little Linford churchyard.<br>
<br>Margoliouth's nephew George Margoliouth (1853&#150;1924) was ordained in 1881 and became keeper of the Hebrew, Syriac, and Ethiopic manuscripts at the British Museum (1891&#150;1914). His son Herschel Maurice Margoliouth (1887&#150;1959) was educated at Rugby School and Oriel College, Oxford, where he became a fellow in 1935 and an expert on early modern English poetry.<br>
<br>Moses Margoliouth was probably related to Ezekiel Margoliouth (1816&#150;1894), also born in Suwa&#322;ki, the son of the rabbi there, Abraham Margoliouth. The two met in the East End about 1864 and became close friends. Ezekiel was baptized in England in 1848 and worked for the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. His son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34874/', "David S. Margoliouth (1858&#150;1940)")</script>, Laudian professor of Arabic at Oxford (1889&#150;1937).<br>
