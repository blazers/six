<span class="headword">Trevor,  John  Hampden-</span>, third Viscount Hampden  (1748&#150;1824), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in London on 24 February 1748 and baptized John Trevor at St George's, Hanover Square, on 26 March, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27733/', "Robert Trevor, later fourth Baron Trevor and first Viscount Hampden (1706&#150;1783)")</script>, a diplomatist, and his wife, Constantia de Huybert (1726/7&#150;1761). In February 1754 his father added Hampden to the family name on succeeding to John Hampden's Buckinghamshire estates.<br>
<br>Hampden-Trevor was educated at Westminster School, and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 28 January 1767. He graduated BA on 20 October 1770 and proceeded MA on 9 July 1773. On 5 August 1773 he married at Slapton, Buckinghamshire, Harriet (1750/51&#150;1829), only child of Daniel Burton, a canon of Christ Church and rector of Slapton; they had no children. Following his father's career, he was appointed on 8 April 1780 minister-plenipotentiary at Munich to the elector palatine and minister to the diet at Regensburg. His principal duty was to watch for attempts by France to negotiate a subsidy treaty, which would secure troops, with any part of the empire. He was also charged with investigating the grievances of protestants in the empire. Having performed his duties satisfactorily, he succeeded Lord Mountstuart as envoy to the Sardinian court in March 1783. He arrived at Turin on 15 October 1783 with instructions to assist the Vaudois and other protestant subjects of the Sardinian king, and to this end he received a Vaudois deputation on 27 December. In January 1785 he was ordered to maintain strict neutrality in the struggle between France and Austria, and his numerous dispatches demonstrate the difficulties of the Sardinian kingdom sandwiched between the two great powers. He tried unsuccessfully to be promoted to Florence in December 1786 but later refused missions to both Russia and Vienna. The title of minister-plenipotentiary was conferred on him on 16 June 1789, with additional pay he had requested six years earlier when he declared that he had spent &pound;4000 more than he received from the government. From 1793 to 1796 the critical state of affairs kept him constantly at his post but in May 1797 he took leave; he was never able to return to Turin because the French occupied the city in July 1798. His official recall was delivered to him in Florence in November 1799 and, having failed to be nominated as an intermediary between the Austrian army and the Piedmont government in May 1800 on the grounds of his too strong attachment to the Sardinian court, he went into retirement.<br>
<br>During his time in Turin, or on leave in Switzerland, Hampden-Trevor counted among his friends Horace Walpole, the Berry sisters, Edmund Burke, Lord Sheffield, and Edward Gibbon; the latter wrote of him in 1792 that he was &#145;par lui-meme un des hommes les plus essentiels et les plus essentiels que j'aye jamais conn&ucirc;s&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward Gibbon</span>, 3.245). In the same year Hampden-Trevor published at Parma <span class="italic">Poemata Hampdeniana</span>, a folio edition of his father's Latin poems, dedicated to George III. Gibbon was also charmed with his wife, as was Benjamin Constant who fell briefly but dramatically in love with her in Lausanne. In retirement, such lustre as accompanied their life in Italy and Switzerland soon faded. When Lord Glenbervie dined with them at Richmond in 1804 he noted:<blockquote>He has a great deal of that stiff politeness which a long diplomatic career is so apt to give. His parts are above par, and he is civil but not agreeable. She has still the remains of a most engaging countenance and manner, but too coaxing and adulatory, which by being perpetual and undiscriminating does not flatter. (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.362)</blockquote>Hampden-Trevor succeeded his brother Thomas in the peerage as third Viscount Hampden on 20 August 1824 and died a few weeks later on 9 September 1824 in Berkeley Square, London. He was buried at Glynde in Sussex. The Hampden estates passed to the Hobart family. He was survived by his wife, who died on 26 June 1829 and was also buried at Glynde.<br>
