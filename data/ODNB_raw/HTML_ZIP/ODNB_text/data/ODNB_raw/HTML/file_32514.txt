<span class="headword">Colville,  (David) John</span>, first Baron Clydesmuir  (1894&#150;1954), <span class="occ">politician and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 13 February 1894 at Motherwell House, Lanarkshire, the only son and younger child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56520/', "John Colville (1852&#150;1901)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51875/', "Colville family")</script>], an industrialist, and his second wife, Christian Downie (<i>d</i>. 1936). His paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37305/', "David Colville (1811/12&#150;1898)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51875/', "Colville family")</script>], had pioneered Scottish steel making; his father was Liberal MP for North-East Lanarkshire (1895&#150;1901).<br>
<br>Born to wealth (unlike his forebears), Colville attended Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a third in part one of the historical tripos in 1914. He was already an officer in the Territorial Force of the 6th battalion, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and, during four years on the western front, he was three times wounded. Colville married Agnes Anne (1890&#150;1970), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50407/', "Sir William Bilsland, first baronet")</script>, a Glasgow businessman, on 6 October 1915. Their children were Ronald, Mary, and Rosemary.<br>
<br>Major Colville served on Lanarkshire county council (1919&#150;26) and the board of the family steel firm, David Colville &amp; Sons (managed by Sir John Craig). As a Lloyd George Liberal, he came fourth at Motherwell at the general election of 1922. As a Unionist he narrowly failed to take Midlothian and Peeblesshire North at a by-election in January 1929 before winning it at the general election five months later. He retained the seat until 1943.<br>
<br>In parliament Colville spoke mainly on economic matters, missing no chance to recommend protective tariffs. The best way to combat unemployment, he said, was to &#145;safeguard&#146; British iron and steel. He knew a lot about industrial &#145;rationalization&#146;, as mergers and amalgamations gave Colvilles Ltd a near monopoly of steel making in Scotland after it became a public company in 1931. Following two months as parliamentary private secretary to No&euml;l Skelton, under-secretary for Scotland, Colville stopped asking questions about imports and answered them instead, as parliamentary secretary to the overseas trade department from 10 November 1931. He was responsible for export credit guarantees and helped to negotiate reciprocal trading agreements with nineteen countries after Britain abandoned free trade. In 1932 his military rank advanced to lieutenant-colonel in the Territorial Army.<br>
<br>Colville became under-secretary for Scotland on 28 November 1935 and worked under Sir Godfrey Collins on agricultural initiatives, such as the Scottish raspberry marketing scheme. A privy councillor from June 1936, he impressed his superiors by always mastering his brief and never straying beyond it. His tone was businesslike yet courteous; narrow eyes and a military moustache gave him a determined appearance. Conservatives felt confidence in an officer and a gentleman who also had a head for figures. In London he lived at 56 Eaton Square; his country home was Braidwood House, Braidwood, near Carluke, in Lanarkshire. He enjoyed shooting and fishing, and touring the western isles aboard his yacht, <i>Iolanthe</i>.<br>
<br>Promotion to financial secretary to the Treasury on 29 October 1936 entailed Colville's working for Neville Chamberlain and Sir John Simon. He ably defended the national defence contribution, a tax on the growth of profits, and had the satisfaction of imposing a tariff on imported beef. In his view, the National Government had inherited the old Liberal motto of &#145;peace, retrenchment, reform&#146;.<br>
<br>Chamberlain appointed John Colville to the cabinet as secretary of state for Scotland on 16 May 1938 in the reshuffle caused by the departure of Lord Swinton. In this office much of his time was devoted to developing policies initiated by his predecessor, Walter Elliot, such as larger subsidies for council housing and industrial estates in depressed &#145;special areas&#146;. In the months preceding the Munich agreement Colville had to busy himself with aid to herring fishermen. He voiced no support in cabinet for Czechoslovakia.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Reorganization of Offices (Scotland) Act</span> 1939 was the most comprehensive reform of Scottish administration since 1885. It replaced the system of semi-autonomous boards with four new departments within the Scottish Office&#151;agriculture, education, health, and home affairs&#151;directly subject to the secretary of state and all located in Edinburgh at the newly built St Andrew's House on Calton Hill. However, because the legislation followed the recommendations of Sir John Gilmour's committee, published in September 1937, it sounded anticlimactic in Colville's lucid but mundane exposition.<br>
<br>Plans for air-raid precautions, evacuation, and increased food production were priorities at the Scottish Office in 1939, and civil servants marvelled at Colville's unremitting application. In March he found time to abolish &#145;irregular&#146; marriages, thus ending the romantic tradition of Gretna Green. Thereafter, non-emergency measures were shelved, including proposals for a highland development commissioner. His expanded department mobilized Scottish civil authorities for war in the autumn.<br>
<br>When Churchill chose his coalition government in May 1940, there was no place for Colville (who is to be distinguished from Sir John Rupert Colville, later Churchill's principal private secretary); he became a full-time colonel on the staff of the lowland district, raising the Home Guard. In 1941 he warned the Scottish advisory council of ex-secretaries of state on post-war problems (&#145;the council of state&#146;) that the policy of industrial concentration threatened to damage Scotland's economy by penalizing light industry in favour of war-producers bound to close down at the end of hostilities.<br>
<br>In November 1942 Colville replaced Sir John Dill as governor designate of the Bombay province. As his support for Churchill in the censure debate of July 1942 had been grudging, many saw this as the exile of another old Chamberlainite, though Amery, the Indian secretary, and Linlithgow, the viceroy, both judged that Sir John Colville (as he became in February 1943) would make an excellent pro-consul&#151;and they were right. When he arrived in Bombay on 23 March 1943, the situation remained tense after the suppression of the &#145;quit India&#146; campaign. With Congress Party leaders imprisoned in the province, the British ran it without cabinet or legislature under Section 93 of the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> (1935). Colville exercised his broad powers shrewdly in successive crises. In April 1944 the accidental explosion of an ammunition ship in Bombay docks made 20,000 people homeless. In February 1946 sailors of the Indian navy mutinied. Communal violence escalated after an elected provincial government took office in April 1946.<br>
<br>As the only former secretary of state to hold a governorship in India since crown rule began in 1858, Colville ranked above his colleagues and deputized several times for the viceroys, Wavell and then Mountbatten, during their absences in London (20 March&#150;6 June and 24 August&#150;16 September 1945, 1&#150;23 December 1946, and 19&#150;30 May 1947). He offered his resignation in February 1947, when the British government removed Wavell and set a terminal date for imperial rule that struck him as premature; the offer was not accepted.<br>
<br>Sir John Colville continued as governor of Bombay for five months after Indian independence and retired on 6 January 1948. As Baron Clydesmuir from March 1948, he addressed the House of Lords on Scottish, industrial, and army matters. A governor of the BBC from 1950 and lord lieutenant of Lanarkshire from 1952, Lord Clydesmuir died at home at Braidwood on 31 October 1954. He was buried on 4 November 1954.<br>
<br>Colville was a proficient executive politician, safe rather than showy. Historians paid him minimal attention, though he was occasionally mentioned as a representative type of Scottish tory: the Clydeside capitalist in politics.<br>
