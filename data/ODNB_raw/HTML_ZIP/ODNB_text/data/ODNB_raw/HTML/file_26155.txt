<span class="headword">Spilsbury <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Taylor]</span>,  (Rebecca) Maria Ann <span class="st"> [Mary]</span></span>  (1777&#150;1820), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 68 Great Ormond Street, London, the daughter (her twin brother died) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26154/', "Jonathan Spilsbury (bap. 1737, d. 1812)")</script>, engraver, and his wife, Rebecca (1748&#150;1812), daughter of Dr Walter Chapman, senior prebendary of Bristol Cathedral. She had a younger brother, Jonathan Robert Henry Spilsbury, who was baptized on 7 December 1779 at St Marylebone, London. Maria Spilsbury received art instruction from her father who, about 1785&#150;9, was drawing-master at Harrow School. His pupils included the sons of Mrs Sarah Tighe of Rossana, co. Wicklow. In 1789, having been employed to teach drawing to Mrs Tighe's daughters, he took his family to Ireland. About May 1791 they moved back to London and settled at 10 St George's Row, Hyde Park. Sir William Beecher gave Maria Spilsbury lessons in colour and she was taught music by Charles Wesley the younger (1757&#150;1834), who considered her the best amateur performer on the organ in London.<br>
<br>Maria Spilsbury exhibited forty-seven works at the Royal Academy as an honorary exhibitor (1792&#150;1808), and thirty-two at the British Institution (1806&#150;13). Her contributions, primarily oil paintings, included portraits, often of children, such as <span class="italic">Miss Elizabeth Angerstein Attended by Guardian Angels</span> (exh. RA, 1805; ex Phillips, 13 June 1997); genre scenes comprising picturesque subjects such as <span class="italic">The Schoolmistress</span> (1803; Tate collection) and <span class="italic">Confusion, or The Nursery in the Kitchen</span> (exh. British Institution, 1811; Williamson Art Gallery and Museum, Birkenhead) and others revealing an interest in charitable initiatives, an example of which is <span class="italic">The House of Protection for Destitute Females of Character; Two Girls Applying for Admission</span> (exh. RA, 1806 and British Institution, 1807); she also exhibited biblical subjects and literary themes from Dr Johnson, William Cowper, Richard Bloomfield, James Thomson, and Mrs Row. Her most ambitious and celebrated works depicted crowd scenes on f&ecirc;te days, holidays, and at open-air meetings: <span class="italic">Christ Feeding the Multitude, the Second Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes&#151;St. Matthew, xv</span> (exh. RA, 1804), <span class="italic">The Fourth of June</span> (exh. RA, 1807 and British Institution, 1808), and <span class="italic">The Royal Jubilee, as Celebrated at Great Malvern, 1809</span> (exh. British Institution, 1811) were all large-scale works, the last measuring 4 ft 6 in. by 5 ft 6 in.<br>
<br>Although Maria Spilsbury and her mother were both members of the Church of England, the family had early associations with nonconformity. Jonathan Spilsbury was received into the Moravian church in 1781; Mrs Tighe, a close friend of the family, was a supporter of John Wesley. Through the Wesleys, the Spilsburys became acquainted, about 1798, with the family of Walter Taylor, a nonconformist who ran a successful engineering business in Southampton. By 1807 Maria was engaged to his son, John Taylor (1785&#150;1821)&#151;dissenter, Calvinist, philanthropist, and unrecognized inventor of the box wheel or Collinges patent axle&#151;who was her junior by eight years, and whom she married at St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 3 November 1808. They lived in rooms at 8 Collyer's Buildings, Blackheath Road, London.<br>
<br>During the year of her engagement Maria Spilsbury worked extremely hard (possibly to finance her forthcoming marriage), exhibiting a total of thirteen paintings in 1807 and twelve in 1808. Her work became fashionable and on private view days at her studio in 10 St George's Row over twenty carriages would sometimes wait outside. The prince regent (George IV) and the marquess of Stafford were regular purchasers of her pictures. For these she charged up to 40 guineas, and such was her success that the family was able to depend upon her income. After the death of her parents in 1812 (both were buried at Bunhill Fields, a nonconformist burial-ground near Wesley's Chapel in London), the Taylors moved into 10 St George's Row with the first of their five children.<br>
<br>In 1814 the Taylors settled in Ireland, where they lived initially with Mrs Tighe in Rossana and from 1817 at her town house in Upper Dorset Street, Dublin. Maria Taylor is said to have exhibited in Dublin at the Hibernian Society (1814, 1816) and at Hawkins Street (1816, 1817, 1819). She continued to paint multiple-figure subjects, such as <span class="italic">John Wesley Preaching in the Open Air at Willybank, Rossana</span> (1814/15; Museum of Methodism at Wesley's Chapel, London), which included representations of her family. This painting is probably <span class="italic">The Irish Fair in the Vale of Glendalough or the Seven Churches</span>, commissioned by the prince regent). <span class="italic">Patron's Day at the Seven Churches, Glendalough</span> (exh. Hawkins Street, 1816; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin), in which the artist painted herself sketching the scene, is another example of her multi-figured subjects. She also executed numerous portraits including <span class="italic">Mrs. Henry Grattan</span> (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin), <span class="italic">Alexander Hamilton and his Wife and Daughters</span>, and <span class="italic">Francis Synge</span>, who founded the Pestalozzi School in Dublin. Many of these remain in private collections in Ireland. A number of her subject pictures and her <span class="italic">Portrait of the Reverend Benjamin Williams Mathias (1772&#150;1841) Chaplain of Bethesda, Dublin</span> were engraved by Charles Turner (1774&#150;1857). Henry Edward Dawe (1790&#150;1848) engraved her <span class="italic">Portrait of the Rev. William Kingsbury</span>. Maria Spilsbury also executed a few original etchings. Other examples of her work are in private collections in New Zealand. She died on 1 June 1820 at her home in Upper Dorset Street, Dublin, and was buried in Drumcondra churchyard. Her husband, John Taylor, died in London the following year.<br>
