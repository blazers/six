<span class="headword">Somerville,  Alexander</span>  (1811&#150;1885), <span class="occ">journalist and soldier</span>, was born on 15 March 1811, at Springfield, Oldhamstocks, East Lothian, the youngest of eleven children of James Somerville, a farm labourer, and Mary Orkney, who before marriage had been a servant in a farmer's house. Somerville grew up in poverty. His father lacked the 1<i>s</i>. required to register his birth, and his mother sewed rags together to clothe him. At the age of eight he was put to work herding, cleaning stables, loading corn sheaves, and ploughing; later he harvested hay, broke stones in a quarry, drained land, and worked in a garden nursery. His parents, who were members of the Anti-Burghers, or General Associate Presbyterian Synod, conducted religious worship each day, and Somerville's religious convictions remained unshaken throughout his life.<br>
<br>Somerville learned to read at home, where he was exposed to religious books, the only kind his father possessed. His formal education was limited to at the most six years, and his attendance at school was irregular as it had to be combined with paid employment. He had anything but fond memories of school, where he was thrashed frequently. He was an avid reader and acquired considerable knowledge, but essentially he was self-taught.<br>
<br>Somerville joined the army in December 1831 and within seven months had become a celebrity and a hero to the many supporters of parliamentary reform. With part of his regiment, the Scots Greys, he was at Birmingham, the site of the largest public meetings in support of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, to aid the civil authorities in the event of disturbances. In May 1832 the fate of the bill was uncertain: there were rumours that an anti-reform tory ministry under Wellington would be appointed, in the event of which large numbers of Birmingham citizens might march to Westminster to present a petition for reform. There were also rumours that in the event of a clash between the civil authorities and the people, the Scots Greys would support the populace. In the midst of this turmoil Somerville wrote to a newspaper asserting that the soldiers would protect property but would not prevent citizens from exercising their liberties, nor would they lend their support to a military government.<br>
<br>Somerville had not violated military regulations, but his officers were outraged and were determined to punish him. Circumstances were contrived to provoke him to be disobedient. At the riding school he was ordered to ride an unfamiliar and difficult horse: after he had dismounted and refused to remount, he was court-martialled and punished with 100 lashes. It became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>: there were protests in newspapers and in parliament, for many assumed that Somerville had suffered punishment for having written the letter. A court of inquiry was convened which exonerated the commanding officer, but through Somerville's interrogation of several officers the suspicion grew that he had been punished for his political action. The publicity surrounding his case contributed to demands for the abolition of flogging in the army.<br>
<br>A subscription was raised to purchase Somerville's discharge from the army, and with his name widely known he had an opportunity to carve out a career that already had attracted him: he acknowledged being &#145;filled with ambition to be an author&#146;  (Somerville, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1st edn, 429). Initially this desire led to his becoming a soldier again, as he served in a British mercenary force in Spain for two years in search of adventures that would allow him to write a book. After his return in 1837 he published newspaper accounts of his war experiences and subsequently a 700 page volume, <span class="italic">History of the British Legion, and War in Spain</span> (1839). This was followed by two somewhat autobiographical novels, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Serjeant Paul Swanston, being a Narrative of a Soldier's Life</span> (1840) and <span class="italic">Life of Roger Mowbray</span> (1853). He also wrote pamphlets and numerous articles for various newspapers. He was pleased to describe himself as engaged in &#145;political authorship&#146;  (Somerville, <span class="italic">Cobdenic Policy the Internal Enemy of England</span>, 17) and to say, &#145;I am a literary man&#146;  (ibid., 14).<br>
<br>A major theme in Somerville's writing harkened back to his experience during the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> crisis&#151;the relationship of the army to the government and to the people in circumstances of popular uprising. Somerville argued that the populace, lacking training, organization, and adequate arms, would be helpless in any conflict against a disciplined body of soldiers. He insisted, moreover, that it was fantasy to assume that soldiers engaged in such conflicts would support working-class political movements. He applied this analysis to the Chartist agitations in 1839, 1842, and 1848, and he was especially worried that the tactics of &#145;physical-force&#146; Chartists would lead to the repression of all working-class political activity. Somerville warned working people about leaders who encouraged street violence, and he severely criticized working-class leaders who used revolutionary rhetoric. His abhorrence of civil conflict and fear of revolution led him to develop what he called a &#145;conservative science of nations&#146;, based on a &#145;logic of revolutions&#146;, according to which revolution led to despotism and the end of civil liberty  (Somerville, <span class="italic">Conservative Science of Nations</span>, 9). This historical theory, which had a long provenance, underpinned Somerville's opposition to revolutionary activity, but it did not lead him to oppose gradualist parliamentary reform that would extend the franchise to increasing numbers of the populace.<br>
<br>Interpreting his own conduct in light of this understanding of working-class political agitation, Somerville developed an image of himself as a saviour of his country. Looking back to 1832 he claimed that his letter &#145;gave the gathered storm that direction which conducted it to peaceful serenity, and saved the unwilling aristocracy from &hellip; the irretrievable disaster of revolution&#146;  (Somerville, <span class="italic">Conservative Science</span>, 13), and thereby saved the country from what would have become Wellington's military despotism. In 1834, when he was in touch with those organizing trade unions, he warned the home secretary of a conspiracy to seize government offices, and ever after he claimed that he had forestalled a revolutionary conspiracy by some of the union leaders. In 1839 he published <span class="italic">Dissuasive Warnings to the People on Street Warfare</span> and claimed that it undermined the efforts of the physical-force Chartists. He also fantasized about preventing the assassination of Queen Victoria at the Great Exhibition of 1851, a theme he included in his novel, <span class="italic">Life of Roger Mowbray</span>. His exaggerated sense of his own significance rested upon an assumption that revolution originated in conspiracy.<br>
<br>Somerville was employed by the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script> in August 1842, after Richard Cobden read his articles signed &#145;One who has whistled at the plough&#146; and was &#145;struck with the graphic force&#146; of his writing  (Cobden to Parkes, 12 Jan 1854, Parkes MSS). He was hired to promote the cause of free trade in agricultural districts where protectionist sentiment was especially strong. To this end Somerville became an itinerant journalist and travelled over the entire country for much of four years, writing a prodigious number of articles for newspapers. In the spirit of a social anthropologist he described farming communities&#151;work habits, the condition of the soil, crops, prices, rents, wages, the state of the roads, diets, dwellings, crime, discontents, religious beliefs&#151;all laced with arguments for free trade. He also included accounts of actual conversations on these topics: one, revealing strong resentments against the clergy among farm labourers, was quoted by Engels in <span class="italic">The Condition of the Working Class in England</span> (1845). Somerville's reports have been compared to William Cobbett's <span class="italic">Rural Rides</span> (1830), and there are patterns of resemblance in the courses of their lives. Many of these writings were published in Somerville's <span class="italic">Whistler at the Plough and Free Trade</span> (1852&#150;3), a three-volume work that included biographies of notable figures in the free-trade movement and those, such as Adam Smith, who had anticipated their efforts. Somerville served the Anti-Corn Law League well and was kept on in spite of periods when he was incapacitated by heavy drinking. He was also sent to Ireland in 1847 to report on the effects of the famine. Later he quarrelled with Cobden and published <span class="italic">Cobdenic Policy the Internal Enemy of England</span> (1854), in which he accused Cobden of unscrupulous tactics and of supporting policies such as pacifism that weakened the country.<br>
<br>From the late 1840s Somerville's journalism became desultory, and he faced financial ruin. In 1857 he suffered a psychiatric episode in which he had delusions of persecution, and the following year he emigrated to Canada. With him travelled his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Binks (1825&#150;1859), daughter of a London cabinet-maker, whom he had married on 10 January 1841, and their six children, but he was left a widower only a year later. His journalism revived and was based largely in Hamilton; he wrote about Canada for several English papers and edited the <span class="italic">Canadian Illustrated News</span> from 1862 to 1864. In 1866 he reported on the Fenian disturbances and published his <span class="italic">Narrative of the Fenian Invasion of Canada</span>, having lost much of his sympathy for the cause of reform in Ireland in the process.<br>
<br>Somerville had hoped to return to England in 1868, but the assassination of Thomas D'Arcy McGee prevented this; Somerville had been counting on payment from McGee for an &#145;emigrant's handbook&#146;. He went on to edit the <span class="italic">Church Herald</span>, from 1873 to 1875, and continued to report on the Fenian disturbances. The Canadian government commissioned articles from him to encourage immigration, and awarded him a pension in 1876. During the last decade of Somerville's life, however, he was isolated, impoverished, and became increasingly eccentric.<br>
<br>Somerville's politics cannot be encompassed with a single label. He had a good deal of class feeling&#151;he had shown &#145;the martinets of the Scots Greys that, although my parents were poor &hellip; and their parents rich &hellip; yet I was a man, and that they were, if quite as much, nothing more&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Soldier</span>, 7 Dec 1833, 1). Throughout his life he sympathized with the working classes and was eager for a democratic suffrage. At the same time he upheld established authority and feared civil conflict, defended the monarchy, and regarded atheists with abhorrence. He also criticized unbridled commerce, and, in spite of his support for free trade, he wished to rescue political economy from the &#145;soulless materialism which had made it &hellip; odious to the People&#146;  (Somerville, <span class="italic">Conservative Science of Nations</span>, 22). He felt great national pride that Britain had achieved reform without sacrificing either order or liberty. His political sentiments reflected his love of &#145;dear old rural England&#146;  (Somerville, <span class="italic">Cobdenic Policy</span>, 18), and he acknowledged that his &#145;mental constitution sympathises with a reasoning conservatism&#146;  (ibid., 38&#150;9).<br>
<br>Somerville was distinguished by his broad Scottish accent and his mountainous size, and Cobden described how &#145;the doorway was literally darkened with the huge awkward hulking figure that came lumbering head-foremost into the room&#146;  (Cobden to Parkes, 12 Jan 1854, Parkes MSS). In old age he weighed more than 20 stone. He was capable of immense physical stamina. There were times when he went on drinking sprees, but they were followed by &#145;fits of penitential remorse&#146;  (ibid.). He was fiercely independent, and throughout his adult life he was obsessively concerned with issues of loyalty and betrayal as they related to social order and revolution. For all his flaws Somerville is memorable for being a self-educated working man who, in spite of great poverty and an unpromising start in life, conducted himself in difficult circumstances with moral seriousness and a sense of honour, and who wrote prodigiously and thoughtfully with a clear and forceful prose style on important economic and political subjects.<br>
<br>Somerville died on 17 June 1885 at his home in York Street, Toronto, Canada, and was buried in the cemetery of the St Andrew's Society at Toronto.<br>
