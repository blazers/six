<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finlaison,  John</span>  (1783&#150;1860), <span class="occ">civil servant and government actuary</span>, was born on 27 August 1783 at Thurso, Caithness, the eldest son of Donald Finlayson (1761&#150;1790), fisherman, who had six children, and his wife, Isobel Guthrie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sutherland (<i>b</i>. 1761). His parents were both Scottish. As a youth Finlaison produced some lyrical poems of considerable merit, none of which survive. In 1799 he was apprenticed to Donald Robeson, writer (legal practitioner) of Thurso. In 1802 he became factor to Sir Benjamin Dunbar, whose estates, together with those of Lord Caithness, were entrusted to his management when he was only nineteen years of age. In 1804 he went to Edinburgh to study for the Scottish bar and was apprenticed to Alexander Glen (1777&#150;1841), writer to the signet. In the same year he visited London on business and also became attached to Elizabeth (1773&#150;1831), the sister of his employer and the daughter of Alexander Glen (1726&#150;1805). In September 1804 Finlaison eloped to London with Elizabeth and they were said to have married there.<br>
<br>Finlaison was offered an appointment with the board of naval revision and took up his post in July 1805. Shortly afterwards he became first clerk to the commission, and he filled that office until the board was wound up in August 1808. For some time previously he had also acted as secretary to a committee of the board, and in that capacity, at the age of only twenty-three, he drafted the eleventh and twelfth reports of the commission for revising the civil affairs of the navy and was the sole author of the system for the reform of the victualling departments. The accounts had seldom been less than eighteen months in arrears, but by Finlaison's system they were produced, checked, and audited in three weeks. The saving made in the navy's Deptford yard in the first year alone, 1809, was &pound;60,000. In 1809 Finlaison was employed to devise a plan for arranging the records and dispatches at the Admiralty, and after nine months of hard work he produced a system for analysing and indexing the records so that any document could be found immediately. This plan met with such universal acclaim that it was adopted in France, Austria, and Russia. Its inventor received as a reward the order of the Fleur-de-lys from Louis XVIII, in 1815  (C. Dupin, <span class="italic">Voyages dans la Grande-Bretagne</span>, 1821, pt. 2, 65&#150;7). In the same year Finlaison was appointed keeper of the records and librarian of the Admiralty, and he became reporter and pr&eacute;cis writer on all difficult and complicated inquiries arising from day to day.<br>
<br>During his twelve years in this post Finlaison was also engaged in many other confidential duties. He was requested by Lord Mulgrave to prepare the materials for a defence of the naval administration before parliament in 1810, and in three months he collected a mass of information which enabled Mulgrave to make a successful defence. In 1811 he compiled an exact record of all the enemy's naval forces, on which accurate information had never before been obtained. Experience proved it to be reliable and it was quoted in parliament as an authority. In the same year Finlaison was employed to investigate the abuses of the &#145;sixpenny revenue&#146; scheme at the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, a fund for the support of the out-pensioners. In his report he showed that by altered arrangements, as well as by the elimination of abuses and sinecure places, pensions could be considerably increased.<br>
<br>After the subject of the salaries of government clerks had been raised in parliament, in 1813, the Admiralty secretary John Wilson Croker directed Finlaison to inquire fully into the case of his department. After six months of detailed work Finlaison completed a report which was used to form a new system of salaries in the Admiralty. In 1814 he compiled the first official <span class="italic">Navy List</span>, a work of great labour, accuracy, and usefulness. It was issued monthly, and Finlaison continued to undertake the task of correcting and editing it until the end of 1821. From 1817 to 1818 he was occupied in developing a biographical register of every commissioned officer in the navy, describing the services, merits, and demerits of each; he grafted this on to his digest and index, which became a valuable reference tool for the lords of the Admiralty. Finlaison also introduced into the naval record office a new attribute of openness towards enquiries from the public.<br>
<br>As librarian to the Admiralty Finlaison found many valuable state papers relating to the American war. In 1813 he was persuaded to attempt to complete Redhead Yorke's &#145;Naval history&#146;, which was intended to form a part of John Campbell's <span class="italic">Lives of the Admirals</span>. He continued the history to 1780, and the work was printed for private circulation, though no further progress was made. In 1815 Finlaison's friend Dr Barry O'Meara, physician to Napoleon at St Helena, started correspondence with him about the former emperor's daily life. In 1824, at the request of the writer, the letters were burnt. However, some copies had fallen into other hands and were published in 1853 as <span class="italic">Napoleon at St Helena and Sir Hudson Lowe</span>.<br>
<br>Since 1812 Finlaison had been working on the establishment of pension provision for the widows and orphans of all who were employed in the civil departments of the Royal Navy. Aided by Lord Melville's intervention, his efforts resulted in the establishment of a fund by order in council on 17 September 1819. The naval medical supplemental fund for the widows of medical officers also owed its existence and subsequent prosperity to Finlaison. He was secretary until 1829, when the directors treated him so badly that he resigned; the fund was ruined by mismanagement in 1860. The success of these charities when under his direction, together with his subsequent investigation into the condition of friendly societies, upon which he was employed by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1824, won Finlaison a private practice among benefit societies; he constructed tables for many of these, prepared the schemes of some, and set up others. Among other societies with which he was connected were the London Life, the Amicable Society, the Royal Naval and Military Life Assurance Company, and the New York Life Assurance and Trust Company.<br>
<br>In 1808 the government had instituted a new system for raising finance based on the granting of life annuities, the tables used being the Northampton tables of mortality. On 1 September 1819 Finlaison's first report to Nicholas Vansittart, chancellor of the exchequer, stated that in eleven years the government had lost &pound;2 million by granting life annuities at prices much below their value. The report was not printed until 1824, when Finlaison was instructed to make further investigations into the true laws of mortality prevailing in England. These investigations led to the discovery that the average duration of human life had increased during the century and resulted in the first mortality tables drawn from British data to show the difference between the mortality rates of men and women. They were also the first tables to use the technique of adjusted average graduation (a method used to eliminate the random fluctuations that arise from observations). In addition the report featured the first sickness data produced from the study of working classes in London (<span class="italic">Life annuities: report of J. Finlaison, actuary of the national debt, on the evidence and elementary facts on which the tables of life annuities are founded</span>, 1829).<br>
<br>Before the close of 1819 Finlaison provided the chancellor of the exchequer with a statement of the age of each of the 14,000 individuals in the receipt of naval pensions or half pay, and he deduced the likely number of deaths among them. In 1821 George Harrison employed him for several months in calculations relative to the <span class="roman">Superannuation Act</span>, and in 1822 he was occupied on matters relating to the commutation of the naval and military pensions and half pay. The measure consequently suggested by him was finally adopted by the Bank of England, which accepted the charge for public pensions in return for payment of the &#145;dead weight&#146; annuity. Finlaison made all the calculations and it was plainly stated in the House of Commons that there was no one else capable of computing the new annuity at the fractional rate of interest agreed.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1822 Finlaison moved from the Admiralty to the Treasury. He was appointed actuary and principal accountant of the check department of the National Debt Office, where he remained until 1851. Finlaison, who sought to alert the government to the loss which was caused by the use of erroneous annuity tables, was ignored for many years, and it was only by the accidental production of one of his letters before Lord Althorp's committee of finance in March 1828 that the matter was taken forward. This letter showed that the revenue was losing &pound;8000 a week, and that this loss was concealed by the method of preparing the yearly accounts. The life annuity system was suspended immediately and remodelled on the basis of Finlaison's 1829 report. Instituted in November 1829 the new system made savings of &pound;390,000 over five years. In 1831 Finlaison made some calculations on the life expectation of slaves and Creoles, before compensation was paid to the slave owners on 1 August 1834. He was consulted by the ecclesiastical commissioners on the means of improving church property, on the question of church leases, and finally on the subject of church rates; he made various reports on these matters, and on one occasion was summoned to attend a cabinet meeting to explain his views to ministers. When the <span class="roman">General Registration Act</span> was passed in 1837, his opinion was sought on the detailed working of the scheme, and he was the first witness called before the parliamentary committee on church leases in the following year. On the formation of the Institute of Actuaries in 1848, he was elected the first president when Griffith Davies stood down, and he retained that position until his death. In 1848 he wrote two reports on the act for lending money to Irish landlords. His first wife had died at Brighton in 1831, and in 1851 Finlaison married Eliza (1807&#150;1896), daughter of Thomas Davis of Waltham Abbey. He retired from public service in August of the same year and employed his remaining days in his favourite study of scripture chronology, and the universal relationship of ancient and modern weights and measures. He was also interested in electricity, and conducted some experiments with Alexander Bain, the pioneer of telegraphy, at Loughton, Essex, in 1842. He published on the subject the following year.<br>
<br>Finlaison died of pulmonary congestion and pneumonia at his home, 15 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, London, on 13 April 1860, and was buried at St Nicholas's Church, Loughton, in Essex. His son, Alexander Glen Finlaison (1806&#150;1892), and his grandson Alexander John Finlaison (1840&#150;1900), also became actuaries. John Finlaison's contemporary reputation was as a skilled practitioner in actuarial analysis addressing questions on life assurance posed by various government departments. His reports showed meticulous application of the theoretical heritage of Richard Price and others. Known to his peers as the government actuary before the title was formally conferred upon Alfred Watson in 1917 and before the government actuary's department was created in 1919, his nomination as first president of the Institute of Actuaries lent weight to the perception of actuaries acting for the public interest beyond mere employment in insurance companies. Before the Assurance Associations Committee of 1853, Finlaison argued for government investigation of life office solvency, which was heeded in 1870. His practical ideas in information retrieval for naval commission records in 1809 were a forerunner of formal library indexing and more modern records management. His contribution to the institute's committee work was unremarkable, but Finlaison as government servant helped to set in train the progression of actuaries from being mere practitioners in the life assurance industry to autonomous professionals able to model financial risk.<br>
