<span class="headword">Needham,  (Amy) Violet</span>  (1876&#150;1967), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 5 June 1876 at 9 John Street, Berkeley Square, London, the younger daughter of Colonel Charles Needham (1844&#150;1934) and his wife, Hendrika Amelie Charlotte Vincentia (Amy) de Tuyll de Serooskerken (1854&#150;1936), a Dutch heiress. Charles Needham was the illegitimate but acknowledged son of Francis Jack, second earl of Kilmorey (1787&#150;1880), and Priscilla Anne, daughter of Captain Sir William Hoste RN (1780&#150;1828). Needham entered the 1st Life Guards, served in the Egyptian campaign (1882), and commanded the regiment (1888&#150;92), but his addiction to gambling brought financial difficulties; the family moved house frequently during Violet's youth as his fortunes changed.<br>
<br>Violet and her sister, Evelyn Norah (1874&#150;1967), were educated at home and became fluent in French, Italian, and German. They accompanied their parents when their father was military attach&eacute; in Rome (1895&#150;1901); later the family lived in London and at their country house, Tylehurst, Forest Row, Sussex, where Violet became friendly with the alpinist Douglas Freshfield (1845&#150;1934). Visits were paid to her mother's relatives in France, Austria, and the Netherlands. After her parents' deaths she moved to 1 Spanish Place, Marylebone, London, and in the early 1950s joined her widowed sister at Horton Hall, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Violet Needham was physically plain, but dressed elegantly and had great personal charm. She remained a Victorian lady, but took to motoring (rather dangerously) and was a heavy smoker of Turkish cigarettes, using a special oval shagreen holder. She once gave her hobbies as gardening and wood chopping, but she also painted and did needlework. Although she published nothing until the age of sixty-three, she had always told stories to young relatives, particularly her four nephews. In 1918 they urged her to write down the latest bedtime story; it was sent to various publishers but was rejected as too adult for children. Twenty years later a niece-in-law showed it to William Collins; on his own children's recommendation he published it in 1939 as <span class="italic">The Black Riders</span>. Eighteen children's books followed, as well as short stories and articles. Only at the age of eighty, following a car accident, did she cease writing.<br>
<br>Violet Needham's most popular stories belong to a sequence of eight set in a group of Ruritanian countries clearly modelled on pre-1914 Austria&#150;Hungary. <span class="italic">The Black Riders</span> (1939), <span class="italic">The Emerald Crown</span> (1940), <span class="italic">The Stormy Petrel</span> (1942), <span class="italic">The House of the Paladin</span> (1945), and their sequels are a heady mixture of romantic backgrounds, swift action, and spine-chilling suspense, with characters remarkable among the children's books of the period for having real moral dilemmas, and faults as well as virtues. She was particularly good at portraying children in relation to adults and at drawing convincing villains. Again unusually, she did not hesitate to kill off major characters. Her books are marked by the importance of loyalty and a firm sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i>&#151;all her heroes and heroines are decidedly upper-class&#151;with an underpinning of strong but unbigoted faith (she was an Anglican), sincere but not sanctimonious. The books were well illustrated by Joyce Bruce, a Gloucestershire neighbour, who worked closely with her to match the drawings to the author's imagination.<br>
<br>Violet Needham's works also include three contemporary English stories with supernatural elements, <span class="italic">The Horn of Merlyns</span> (1943), <span class="italic">The Bell of the Four Evangelists</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">Pandora of Parrham Royal</span> (1951); two Ruritanian historical stories, <span class="italic">The Woods of Windri</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">The Changeling of Monte Lucio</span> (1946); and a historical tale, <span class="italic">The Boy in Red</span> (1948), dealing with William the Silent and using as a setting Clingendaal near The Hague, a house belonging to Dutch relatives.<br>
<br>Violet Needham's heyday was the 1940s, when her books reached a wide audience through being broadcast on <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, and her young readers included Auberon Waugh, Antonia Fraser, A. S. Byatt, and Alice Thomas Ellis. She died of heart failure at Horton Hall, Gloucestershire, on 8 June 1967. She was cremated, and her ashes scattered at Little Sodbury Manor, Gloucestershire. After a period of neglect her works began to arouse interest in the 1980s; the Violet Needham Society was formed in 1985.<br>
