<span class="headword">Beckett,  Edmund</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Edmund  Beckett Denison]</span>, first Baron Grimthorpe  (1816&#150;1905), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical controversialist, architect, and horologist</span>, was born at Carlton Hall, near Newark, on 12 May 1816, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57573/', "Sir Edmund Beckett, fourth baronet (1787&#150;1874)")</script>, later MP for the West Riding, and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 27 March 1874), daughter of William Beverley and great-niece and heir of Anne Denison, widow of Sir Thomas Denison. His father had assumed the additional surname of Denison in 1816 but reverted to his original surname on succeeding to the baronetcy in 1872. His brothers included the banker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48805/', "William Beckett")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46612/', "Beckett, Rupert Evelyn")</script>].<br>
<br>Beckett Denison was educated at Doncaster grammar school, Eton College, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1834 and graduated BA in 1838 (MA 1841, LLD 1863). He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1841, became a QC in 1854, a bencher of his inn in the same year, and its treasurer in 1876. On 7 October 1845 he married Fanny Catherine Lonsdale (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17002/', "John Lonsdale")</script>, bishop of Lichfield, of whom he wrote a biography (1868). He soon acquired a large practice chiefly in connection with railway bills. Advancing rapidly in his profession, by 1860 he was recognized as the leader of the parliamentary bar, as a result more of his assertive manner than of his knowledge of law. He accumulated a large fortune and ceased to practise regularly after 1880. On his father's death on 24 May 1874, he succeeded to the baronetcy and followed his father's example in discarding the second surname. As Sir Edmund Beckett he was appointed chancellor and vicar-general of the province of York in 1877, an office which he held until 1900. In recognition of his activity in ecclesiastical matters, as well as his architectural and mechanical contributions, Beckett was created a peer by the title of Baron Grimthorpe of Grimthorpe, Yorkshire, on 17 February 1886.<br>
<br>Beckett had many interests outside the law and was a vigorous and acrimonious controversialist on ecclesiastical, architectural, scientific, and other topics. Among his earliest causes was a measure of relaxation in the law surrounding marriage with a deceased wife's sister. He was a strong advocate of reform in church discipline, giving evidence before the royal commission on ecclesiastical courts of 1883 and drafting a disciplinary bill of his own with racy notes which he sent to the commissioners. He took exception to the revised version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, publishing in 1882 <span class="italic">Should the Revised New Testament be Authorized?</span> Alarmed by the spread of ritualism in the Church of England, he became president of the Protestant Churchmen's Alliance, which held its inaugural meeting in Exeter Hall in 1889. Archbishop Benson's judgment in 1890 in the trial of the bishop of Lincoln for ritual offences stirred him to write what Benson called a &#145;furious letter&#146;, entitled &#145;A review of the Lambeth judgment in <i>Read</i> v. <i>Bishop of Lincoln</i>&#146;. On occasions his involvement in ecclesiastical affairs was helpful: his assistance with the <span class="roman">Church Patronages Bill</span> of 1893, for example, was welcomed. But at other times he was spiteful and vituperative: he made a startling attack on the archbishop of York in 1895 while opposing in the Lords a divorce bill amending the act by which the clergy were compelled to lend their churches for the remarriage of those guiltily divorced. His standpoint through all his disputes was strongly Erastian and orthodox, as he understood orthodoxy. In 1883, for the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, he published <span class="italic">A Review of Hume and Huxley on Miracles</span>, which Bishop Harold Browne considered one of the best books in defence of Christianity.<br>
<br>Architecture, especially on its ecclesiastical side, was another of Beckett's interests, and he published widely on this subject between 1855 and 1876. One of the projects with which he was involved, the rebuilding of St George's Church at Doncaster, led the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott to acknowledge Beckett's generosity but also to remark upon his &#145;unpleasant way of doing things&#146;  (G. G. Scott, <span class="italic">Personal and Professional Recollections</span>, 1877, 173). Beckett claimed to have &#145;substantially designed&#146; many buildings, including the church of St James, Doncaster; St Chad's Church, Headingley; Cliffe parish church in the East Riding; St Paul's, Burton upon Trent; the tower top of Worcester Cathedral; Doncaster grammar school; and the extension of Lincoln's Inn Library. His influence is also to be traced in the poorly received restoration of Lincoln's Inn chapel in 1882, but his contemplated demolition of Sir Thomas Lovell's gatehouse in Chancery Lane was happily frustrated.<br>
<br>Living in a house at Batch Wood, St Albans, Hertfordshire, designed by himself (&#145;the only architect with whom I have never quarrelled&#146;), he was interested in the unsound condition of St Albans Abbey, and the attempts of the St Albans reparation committee to fit it for cathedral and parochial service. He subscribed generously to the funds, contributing, from first to last, some &pound;30,000, and interfered freely with Scott, the architect. &#145;The leader among those who wish me to do what I ought not to do is Sir Edmund Beckett&#146;, Scott wrote in 1877  (G. G. Scott, <span class="italic">Personal and Professional Recollections</span>, 1877, 357). In 1880 various parts of the building were in danger of falling down, and the committee was &pound;3000 in debt. Beckett obtained permission to restore the church at his own expense. He set to work with characteristic zeal, and by 1885 the nave was finished. But his arbitrary architectural decisions excited fierce criticism, and he entered into arguments with both George Edmund Street, architect, and Henry Hucks Gibbs who had obtained concurrent permission to restore the high altar screen. This conflict of authority came before Sir Francis Jeune, chancellor of the diocese, in 1889, Beckett conducting his own case. Neither side was completely successful. Beckett described his part in the St Albans controversies in <span class="italic">St Albans Cathedral and its Restoration</span> (1885), which, though purporting to be a guidebook, is also a somewhat vehement review of the old arguments.<br>
<br>Through his long life Beckett worked on mechanical inventions and was a keen horologist. In 1850 he published <span class="italic">A Rudimentary Treatise on Clock and Watchmaking</span> which passed through eight editions, in the preface to the last of which he claimed to have designed over forty clocks, in churches, cathedrals, railway stations, and town halls, including some in the colonies. He contributed articles on clocks, watches, and bells to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He designed the great clock for the Great Exhibition of 1851, made by Edward John Dent, which was later installed at King's Cross railway station. In the same year he undertook, in conjunction with George Biddell Airy and Dent, the construction of the great clock for the clock tower in the Houses of Parliament, Westminster. The design was Beckett's, as an inscription records, and it included a new gravity escapement designed by him. Beckett also prepared the specifications for the bell commonly called Big Ben, after Sir Benjamin Hall, commissioner of public works. The clock and Big Ben, like most of Beckett's undertakings, involved him in fierce controversies. He antagonized the respected horologist B. L. Vulliamy by ridiculing his design for the clock. Vulliamy was effectively ousted by Beckett from involvement in the project. Airy, too, felt forced to withdraw. And Barry suffered sixteen years of disputes. Beckett was elected president of the Horological Institute in 1868, on condition that he should not attend dinners, and was annually re-elected, though not always without opposition.<br>
<br>Although a man of arrogance and bile, Beckett was capable of generosity, strong friendships, and kindness towards people in need of help. He was tall and stern looking and remained faithful to early Victorian dress. He died at Batch Wood, St Albans, on 29 April 1905, after a short illness, aggravated by a fall, and was buried by his wife's side in the burial-ground of St Albans Cathedral. His personal estate was valued at &pound;1,562,500, and he left a complicated will with many codicils which was the cause of prolonged litigation. Having no children, he was succeeded in his titles by a nephew, Ernest William Beckett.<br>
