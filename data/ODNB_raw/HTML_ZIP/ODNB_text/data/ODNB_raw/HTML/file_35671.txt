<span class="headword">Rankin, Sir  George Claus</span>  (1877&#150;1946), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 12 August 1877 at Lamington in Lanarkshire, the second son of the Revd Robert Rankin, minister of Lamington, and his wife, Theresa Margaret, daughter of George John Claus, shipowner, of Liverpool. He was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated in 1897 with first-class honours in philosophy. He was awarded the Bruce of Grangehill and Falkland prize and won the Vans Dunlop (1897) and Ferguson (1899) scholarships. In October 1897 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a sizar, becoming a scholar the following year, and was placed in the first class of both parts of the moral sciences tripos (1899, 1900). He twice won a Hooper declamation prize and in 1901 was awarded a Whewell scholarship to which he was re-elected in 1903. In 1901 he was also president of the union.<br>
<br>In 1904 Rankin was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn and entered the chambers of William Pickford, where he became acquainted with Lancelot Sanderson. He practised mainly in bankruptcy and commercial cases. In 1910 Rankin married Alice Maud Amy (<i>d</i>. 1924), daughter of Geoffrey Sayer, of Bromley, Kent; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1916 Rankin received a commission in the Royal Garrison Artillery and served until 1918. On returning to the bar he found his practice dispersed and was faced with the uncertainty of regaining it, without the advantage of private means and with the anxieties of family responsibilities. So at the suggestion of Sanderson, then chief justice of Bengal, he accepted appointment as a puisne judge of the high court of Calcutta. In 1919 he served as a member of the Hunter commission appointed to report on the disturbances at Amritsar and the action taken by General R. E. H. Dyer. In 1924 he served as chairman of the civil justice committee appointed to make recommendations for the reform of legal procedure in British India, particularly with reference to the law's delays. In recognition of these services he was knighted in 1925, and a year later, on Sanderson's retirement, he was appointed chief justice of Bengal, the first puisne judge of the Calcutta high court to be so promoted. Early in 1934 his health failed; he returned to England on long leave and eventually resigned his office.<br>
<br>In the following year Rankin's health was sufficiently restored for him to be able to resume work. He was appointed to inquire into the disorders at Barlinnie prison, Glasgow, was sworn of the privy council, and later in 1935 succeeded Sanderson in one of the two paid posts on the judicial committee of that body created by the <span class="roman">Appellate Jurisdiction Act</span>, 1929. He was elected a bencher of his inn and in 1937 received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh University. In 1944 his health again broke down and he was forced to retire.<br>
<br>In both his private and his professional life Rankin was remarkable for his unassuming modesty and natural courtesy. The latter quality in particular endeared him to his colleagues and to the bar, both in India and in Downing Street. It was a friendly courtesy, recognized by practitioners as no mere conventional politeness. But it did not permit the abuse of the time of the court: persistence too prolix in an unacceptable argument met with observations containing more than a touch of acerbity.<br>
<br>Early in his tenure of office in India, Rankin applied himself to an exhaustive study of Hindu and Muslim law in both of which systems he attained a profound knowledge. His judgments delivered in India in cases governed by these laws were acknowledged to be of the greatest assistance to the judicial committee of the privy council in dealing with appeals from Indian courts. He also became thoroughly versed in all the complexities of the <span class="roman">Bengal Tenancy Act</span>, probably the most intricate code of law relating to land tenure ever devised by human wit. In dealing with cases which came before him, of whatever nature, Rankin excelled in quickly sifting out the essential questions of fact or law involved. His judgments were distinguished by great clarity of expression: only in rare instances did subtlety of thought find expression in a passage of some seeming obscurity.<br>
<br>When he became a member of the judicial committee, it was soon apparent that Rankin was a real addition of strength. However modestly he expressed his views, however seldom he intervened during argument, he proved himself capable of great tenacity in upholding his own opinion. Lord Maugham, on the occasion of his death, wrote of him: &#145;there has been no judge of my time who more greatly impressed me in a sphere he may be said to have made his own&#146;  (private information). He was probably the greatest judicial authority on Indian jurisprudence of his time. Rankin's authoritative <span class="italic">Background to Indian Law</span> appeared in 1946. Rankin died at the Beach Hotel, at Elie, Fife, on 8 April 1946.<br>
