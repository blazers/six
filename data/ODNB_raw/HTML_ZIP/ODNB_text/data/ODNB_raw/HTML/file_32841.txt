<span class="headword">Dixon,  Walter Ernest</span>  (1870&#150;1931), <span class="occ">pharmacologist</span>, was born at Fern Bank, Darlington, on 2 June 1870, the younger son of Robert Bland Dixon, architect and surveyor, and his wife, Mary Ann Whitecomb (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Parr). He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32840/', "Sir Robert Bland Dixon")</script>. Dixon was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Darlington, and entered St Thomas's Hospital in 1890, graduating BSc in 1891 and MD (London) in 1898. In 1899 he was appointed assistant to the Downing professor of medicine at Cambridge. On 25 September 1907 he married Hope (<i>b</i>. 1874/5), only daughter of Francis Glen Allan, banker, of Dulwich; they had no children. In 1909 Dixon was made lecturer and in 1919 first reader in pharmacology at Cambridge, a post he held until his death. He also held concurrently, until 1919, the chair of materia medica at King's College, London. For his services in the intelligence department of the Royal Navy during the First World War he was appointed OBE in 1919.<br>
<br>When Dixon began to devote himself to pharmacology in 1899, there was no university chair in this subject in England, and the science received little attention from the point of view of teaching or research. By the time of Dixon's death, chairs of pharmacology had been established in many English universities and the subject was achieving something like the recognition it deserved. Dixon played a dominant part in fostering this development. He taught pharmacology as an experimental science and as the scientific basis of therapeutics. As a writer, teacher, lecturer, and investigator, he became one of the foremost pharmacologists in the world. H. H. Dale said that, under Dixon, pharmacology became &#145;a lively adventure in experimental science, offered with an inimitable racy humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>). Dixon was author of <span class="italic">A Manual of Pharmacology</span> (1905; 7th edn, 1929) and <span class="italic">Practical Pharmacology</span> (1920).<br>
<br>Dixon's original researches, of which only a few can be mentioned, covered a wide field. With the help of various collaborators he investigated the physiology and pharmacology of the bronchial muscles, the pulmonary circulation, and the cerebro-spinal fluid. He was greatly interested in the subjects of addiction and tolerance to drugs and in various papers dealt with the pharmacology of hallucinogens and the physiology of addiction. His work on Indian hemp in the 1890s concluded that it was a &#145;useful and refreshing stimulant and food accessory&#146;  (&#145;The pharmacology of cannabis indica&#146;, <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 11 Nov 1899, 1357). In other papers he dealt with tobacco, morphine, alcohol, cocaine, and heroin. Dixon was a member of the departmental committee on morphine and heroin addiction (1924&#150;6), chaired by Sir Humphry Rolleston, the report of which confirmed a medical basis for drug control in Great Britain. Dixon's public pronouncements strongly favoured this policy and opposed attempts to bring Britain into line with the prohibitionist drug control policy of the United States. He was subsequently a member of the League of Nations expert committee on drug addiction.<br>
<br>In 1907 Dixon suggested that when a nerve is excited the resultant effect may be due to the liberation of some chemical substance. The subsequent corroboration of this hypothesis revolutionized concepts of the nature of transmission of nerve impulses, and constituted one of the most far-reaching advances in physiology of the twentieth century. Dixon's suggestion was, however, based on somewhat slender experimental data, and gained little credence at the time.<br>
<br>Dixon's impact on his generation rested not only on his own contributions to science: he also took a wide and participating interest in medical affairs. His witty and persuasive lectures and dogmatic writing had a potent influence in moulding medical thought within and beyond his own university. His buoyant and resolute spirit was a stimulus and example to his fellows. He was &#145;the leader, life, and soul of the party. His wit was sprightly and never cruel&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>).<br>
<br>Dixon was elected FRS in 1911 and FRCP in 1930. The University of Manitoba conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD in 1930. He died suddenly at his home, The Grove, at Whittlesford, near Cambridge, on 16 August 1931. He was survived by his wife.<br>
