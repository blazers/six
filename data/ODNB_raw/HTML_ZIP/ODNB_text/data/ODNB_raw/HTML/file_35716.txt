<span class="headword">Reid,  James Smith</span>  (1846&#150;1926), <span class="occ">classical scholar and historian</span>, was born at Sorn, Ayrshire, on 3 May 1846, the eldest son of John Reid, schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Smith. Among collateral relatives on his mother's side he reckoned Adam Smith, author of <span class="italic">The Wealth of Nations</span>. He was educated first in Arbroath and then at the City of London School, and entered Christ's College, Cambridge, as a scholar in 1865. Three years later (1868) he was bracketed senior classic, and was awarded the Browne medal for a Latin epigram. He was senior chancellor's medallist in 1869, and the same year was elected a fellow of his college. While studying classics Reid also studied law, and was Whewell scholar in 1870 and graduated LLM in 1872. In the same year he married Ruth, daughter of Thomas Gardner, and sister of Professor Percy Gardner, Professor Ernest Gardner, and Miss Alice Gardner. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>From 1873 to 1878 and again from 1880 to 1885 Reid was classical lecturer at Pembroke College, and in 1878, having ceased to be a fellow of Christ's on his marriage in 1872, he was elected to a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, where he remained a fellow for forty-four years. Here, together with the Revd E. S. Roberts (master of the college, 1903&#150;12), he built up a brilliant classical school. In 1899 he was elected first professor of ancient history in the university, and held this chair until 1925. He received the honorary degrees of LittD of Dublin University and LLD of St Andrews University, and in 1917 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. He was also an honorary fellow of Christ's College, where he had continued to lecture until 1880.<br>
<br>Reid's main interests were in Roman literature and history, and he quickly established himself as a leading Ciceronian scholar, bringing to the elucidation of the texts a particular mastery of idiom. He was greatly influenced by the work of the Danish philologist Johan Nicolai Madvig. In the early stages of his career he produced several compact editions of philosophical and oratorical works of Cicero. These were chiefly designed for undergraduates preparing for the classical tripos, which underwent several revisions in this period. The most important of these editions was of the <span class="italic">Academica</span> (1874) which appeared in an enlarged edition in 1885, and for which he gained the degree of LittD at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Reid's considerable teaching commitments together with his tutorship at Caius (1885&#150;99) and his tenure of the chair of ancient history (1899&#150;1925) greatly delayed the publication of his major work&#151;an edition of <span class="italic">De finibus</span>. Although he had produced a translation in 1883, the edition which he had begun to prepare at the same time was not published until 1925 and only covered books one and two. It was unfortunate that Reid's advanced age and failing health made it impossible for him to revise his text in the light of new approaches to the manuscript tradition. Nevertheless the edition shows a deep understanding of the Greek philosophical sources as well as the linguistic idioms of Cicero's work, and its value is increased by the copious illustrations of usage provided.<br>
<br>As first professor of ancient history Reid took on a heavy burden of lecturing which limited his published work. He produced several articles on Roman law and constitutional history, and made contributions to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Companion to Latin Studies</span>. His only historical book&#151;<span class="italic">The Municipalities of the Roman Empire</span> (1913)&#151;was the published version of his Lowell lectures. Although the chapters on the theory and history of the Roman municipality in the abstract are valuable, the absence of documentation limits its use.<br>
<br>Reid played a large part in the foundation in 1910 of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, of which he succeeded F. J. Haverfield as president in 1916. He was an active member of the editorial committee of the <span class="italic">Journal of Roman Studies</span> and of the council of the British School at Rome. For fifteen years he was a tutor of Caius, but his forte was in scholarship and teaching rather than in administration. For university affairs he had little taste. In politics he was a Liberal of the old school, and was for some years chairman of the party in the town of Cambridge. His personality, in which the desire to shine found no place, was gentle and kindly. He retired from his chair on the ground of failing health in 1925, and died at Cambridge on 1 April 1926.<br>
