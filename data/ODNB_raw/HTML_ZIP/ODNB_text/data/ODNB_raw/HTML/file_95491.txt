<span class="headword">Miller,  Charles William</span>  (1874&#150;1953), <span class="occ">footballer and administrator</span>, was born in Bras, an industrial neighbourhood in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, on 24 November 1874, the second son of John Miller (1844&#150;1886), a Scottish merchant and commission agent, and his wife, Charlotte (Carlota), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fox (<i>d</i>. 1892), a Brazilian woman of English heritage. His parents had married in the British consulate in S&atilde;o Paulo on 2 March 1872, his father having arrived in South America from Scotland in the early 1860s. His paternal grandfather was a shipowner, operating between Greenock and Rio de Janeiro. In early 1884, aged nine, Miller was sent to England to be educated at Banister Court School, Millbrook, near Southampton. He embraced the new cult of physical education and team sports, and excelled at both association football and cricket, playing football for St Mary's (later known as Southampton Football Club), Hampshire, and also making an appearance for the Corinthians.<br>
<br>In 1894, aged twenty, Miller returned to S&atilde;o Paulo, bringing the football rules established by the Football Association in 1863 as adopted by the Hampshire FA, two footballs, and great enthusiasm for the game. Three decades later he recalled his return:<blockquote>On the quay in Santos, solemn, as if he were at a funeral, my father was waiting for me to disembark holding my degree certificate. But in fact I appeared in front of him with two footballs, one in each hand &hellip; the old man, surprised, enquired:<div>&#145;What is this Charles?&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;My degree&#146;, I replied.<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;What?&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;Yes! Your son has graduated in football &hellip;&#146;.<br>
</div>
<div>The old man, in good spirits, laughed. I was off the hook &hellip;.<br>
</div>(interview with Charles Miller, <span class="italic">O Imparcial</span>, 21 Oct 1927, reproduced in Hamilton, 9)</blockquote>This exchange has long been celebrated as the original moment when the sport of football arrived in Brazil. Miller, in retelling it, was part of this foundational moment, relishing the role he had been assigned in a complicated story of transnational, imperial, transatlantic, and cultural transfer from Europe to Brazil which was much easier to understand as the work of one prescient &#145;great&#146; man. There are many doubts about the facts of the legend: his father, John Miller, had in fact died in Glasgow in 1886, and the man who received him in Santos was probably an uncle; other footballs had arrived before Miller's (though admittedly they had not been promoted or received with such enthusiasm); and many football games had already been played on Brazilian soil by visiting Royal Navy crews in the preceding decades.<br>
<br>There is no doubt, however, that on his return from England, Miller evangelized for football in Brazil. On 15 April 1895 he organized what has been remembered as the first game played in Brazil &#145;officially&#146; under the rules of the English FA, recruiting players from the British community. The match pitted the Gas Company versus the S&atilde;o Paulo Railway, who won 4&#150;2. Inspired, Miller was the driving force behind the organization of more and more matches, including the first &#145;international&#146; match on Brazilian soil, against a South African touring party in 1902. He was instrumental in the setting up of a S&atilde;o Paulo football league, the Liga Paulista, which his team, SPAC, won in its first three years: 1902, 1903, and 1904. As a footballer he was a skilful technical player as well as a strong runner. His name survived in the &#145;<i>chaleira</i>&#146;, defined in the S&atilde;o Paulo football dictionary as &#145;Charles&#151;skill in which the player bends his leg back and kicks the ball with his heel&#146;  (Hamilton, 126).<br>
<br>Miller worked as a clerk for the S&atilde;o Paulo Railway Company, and then (from 1904) he was the agent for the Royal Mail, and acting British vice-consul. He became a central figure in the British and commercial communities in S&atilde;o Paulo, as much for his amateur sporting activities as for his professional duties. In January 1906 he married the pianist Antonietta Rudge (1885&#150;1974), ten years younger than him, who was from a far wealthier and established British family in S&atilde;o Paulo. They were distant cousins. They had two children, Carlos Rudge Miller, born in February 1907, and Helena Rudge Miller, born in 1909. Miller accompanied his wife on her concert tours of Europe. The couple later separated, and from 1922 Antonietta had a relationship with the Brazilian futurist poet and journalist Menotti del Picchia.<br>
<br>In 1910 the Corinthians, symbol and pride of British amateur football, toured Brazil, which was in the grip of a crisis around the consequences of footballers being paid to play, many of these shaped by prejudices and fears of class and race. Miller remained a strident advocate of amateur sport throughout his life, believing that &#145;professionalism, for me, is not sport&#146; (Miller, 1928, interview in <span class="italic">O Estado</span>, reproduced in Hamilton, 148). It is often repeated, and is possible, that Miller had a hand in suggesting the name Corinthians for the new, working-class team founded in 1910 which became one of Brazil's most important clubs.<br>
<br>Miller made frequent visits to Britain, a benefit of his position as a Royal Mail agent. He was a founder member of the British Chamber of Commerce in S&atilde;o Paulo, instituted during the First World War. He profited from investing in the construction of garden suburbs in S&atilde;o Paulo, built according to the designs of the British architects Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, and built and lived in a large villa in the Jardins America. In the later years of his life he largely eschewed professional sports, continuing to play cricket and golf, and was cared for by the family of his son, Carlos Miller. In 1948, aged seventy-three, he was honoured by making the ceremonial kick-off for the match in S&atilde;o Paulo between the visiting Southampton side and a S&atilde;o Paulo eleven. The local press described him as &#145;one of the first English footballers out here and a well-known character&#146; (<span class="italic">Southampton Echo</span>, reproduced in Hamilton, 166). He died on 30 June 1953 in S&atilde;o Paulo and was buried in the city's protestant cemetery.<br>
<br>The legend of Miller as the father of football in Brazil persists, in the face of much historical evidence uncovered after his death, and has been entrenched by urban design, football history, and media representations of the historical footballing links between Britain and Brazil. What made Miller's return to the country in 1894 notable and worthy of commemoration was that he was identifiably Brazilian rather than foreign. His Scottish-born father and his &eacute;lite education abroad were counteracted by his Brazilian-born mother, his own Brazilian birth, and his wholehearted commitment to Brazil during his life. His legend encapsulated Brazil's story: the land of immigrants caught between new and old worlds, seeking and finding a new identity somewhere in between. In football Brazil found a space where it could take on and outperform all other nations: it is for this reason that its myth of origin became so important, and why Miller's story has endured.<br>
