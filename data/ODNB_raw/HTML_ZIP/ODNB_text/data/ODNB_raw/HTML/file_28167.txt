<span class="headword">Vavasour, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1506), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of John Vavasour of Spaldington in Yorkshire, and his wife Isabel, daughter and coheir of Thomas de la Hay, lord of Spaldington. He studied law at the Inner Temple. His first employment in court recorded in the year-books took place in Trinity term 1467, and in Trinity term 1478 he was invested with the order of the coif. He acted as legal adviser to various corporations and individuals, including Richard, duke of Gloucester. On 15 June 1483, in the last fortnight of the reign of Edward V, he was nominated a king's serjeant, an appointment renewed by Richard III and Henry VII. On 23 September 1485 he was appointed second justice at Lancaster, and was promoted to chief justice there in 1495. In the first year of Henry VII's reign the king and the earl of Northumberland put forward candidates for the post of recorder of York, but the corporation defended its autonomy and elected Vavasour (who had acted for the city for some years) in spring 1486. He continued in office until his appointment as puisne justice of the common pleas on 17 October 1489. He was knighted in 1501.<br>
<br>Vavasour married, possibly as his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1509), daughter of Robert Tailboys, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26949/', "Sir William Tailboys")</script>. She was the widow of an unidentified Greystoke, probably Sir Robert (<i>d</i>. 1483). In 1494 she and Vavasour were estranged, with Vavasour denying her any share of his land unless she repaid &pound;700 she had taken away; but matters were apparently settled by 1502 when Vavasour granted her a life interest in Badsworth, Yorkshire. In the sixteenth century Vavasour was remembered as &#145;a very homely man and rude of condycyons and lovyd never to spend mych money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Testamenta Eboracensia</span>, 4.90). From a memorial dated 1505&#150;6 it appears that he was concerned in Sir Richard Empson's lawsuit against Sir Robert Plumpton, and that he allowed himself to be influenced by Empson. Vavasour was discharged as judge on 16 October 1506. He died without issue on 26 November 1506 and was buried in St Helen's, Bishopgate, London. His heir was Peter, son of his brother William.<br>
