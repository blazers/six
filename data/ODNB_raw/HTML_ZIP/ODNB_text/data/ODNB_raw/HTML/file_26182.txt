<span class="headword">Sprot <span class="st"> [Sprott]</span>,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1608), <span class="occ">conspirator and forger</span>, was a notary of Eyemouth, Berwickshire, who by no later than 1600 had become intimate in the affairs of Robert Logan, seventh laird of Restalrig, and a regular guest at his house at Gunsgreen. Logan died in 1606, but two years later Sprot let slip, while drunk, that he had knowledge of the Gowrie conspiracy. When arrested and interrogated by the privy council in April 1608 Sprot confessed to possession of letters written by Logan to the third earl of Gowrie and others suggesting a plot to abduct James VI to Fast Castle. Tortured in iron boots, he recanted and admitted he had forged the letters. The case was nevertheless brought to the attention of George Home, earl of Dunbar, who intervened to halt the torture and persuade Sprot to revert to his original confession implicating Logan, though Sprot continued to maintain that the letters were themselves forgeries. The likely motive for forging the letters appears to have been to blackmail Logan's heir.<br>
<br>Sprot was tried and convicted for his role in the conspiracy in August. At his trial it emerged that he had made a regular business of forging letters and receipts for other clients. He was hanged, broken, and quartered at Edinburgh High Cross on 12 August 1608. The following June Logan's corpse was exhumed for the treason trial conducted to forfeit his son Robert, and Sprot's letters were introduced as evidence. The five letters, dated between 18 and 31 July and variously addressed to Gowrie, Logan's agent James Bower, and an unknown person, disclose intrigue between Logan and the Ruthvens, but do not clearly reveal its purpose. Before he was executed Sprot had clarified earlier contradictory statements to confess that he had copied the letter addressed to Gowrie directly from an original letter penned by Logan which he had seen, but that the others were pure inventions based upon this letter. Sprot's compliance may have been secured by Dunbar's promise to safeguard the welfare of his wife and children after his death. The Logan estates were forfeited, to the ruin of the family but also to the considerable benefit of the earl of Dunbar, who still owed a substantial sum for the purchase of the traitor's Berwickshire lands.<br>
