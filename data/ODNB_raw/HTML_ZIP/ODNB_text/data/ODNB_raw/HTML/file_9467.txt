<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finlay,  Kirkman</span>  (1773&#150;1842), <span class="occ">cotton merchant</span>, was born in April 1773 in the Gallowgate, Glasgow, the second son of James Finlay (1727&#150;1790), a minor Glasgow textile merchant, and his wife, Abigail, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whirry, the daughter of an innkeeper at Whitehaven, Cumberland. James Finlay had the foresight to invite Richard Arkwright to Scotland to advise on the erection of spinning mills, and in 1783 he was a founder of the Glasgow chamber of commerce&#151;the first in Britain. Kirkman Finlay was educated in Glasgow at the grammar school and briefly at the university, and spent six months in Paris in a silk merchant's house before joining his father as a partner in James Finlay &amp; Co., aged only seventeen, as his signature on surviving documents proves&#151;perhaps in anticipation of his father's death the following year. He raised the annual balance from &pound;11,784 in 1789 to &pound;255,496 in 1800, and increased it steadily thereafter through the manufacture and wholesaling of fine and embroidered muslins and mill-spun yarns to new markets in Europe, the Americas, and India. He bought three large Arkwright-type spinning mills in the west of Scotland, and controlled production vertically from the purchase of cotton in the USA to finishing and marketing. Using the protection of Royal Navy bases he established agents at Heligoland (Patrick Colquhoun) for northern Europe, Gibraltar (John Galt), and Malta (Ritchie and Steuart), who, with four travelling partners, serviced &#145;upward of 700 correspondents upon the continent of Europe&#146;, ranging from St Petersburg through Germany, Spain, Italy, the Levant, Malta, and up the Danube via Turkish Greece to Austria&#150;Hungary. Because of the British blockade of Europe and the Napoleonic Berlin decrees which forbade trade with Britain, much of this trade was doubly illegal. Goods for northern Europe went through the Forth and Clyde Canal to Hull, and from there were forwarded&#151;smuggled&#151;by a partner, MacConnel Kennedy &amp; Co., of Manchester. Finlay displaced the board of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company in a takeover in order to facilitate passage of goods from the west of Scotland across the North Sea, and as chairman he printed and distributed to all shareholders the first known annual report and accounts of a British company in a format that became standard.<br>
<br>From 1806 Finlay opened branches in Charleston, New Orleans, and New York, in partnership with Eason Alston &amp; Co., a Glasgow merchant house engaged in buying raw cotton and selling Glasgow manufactures. He also in 1806 opened a branch of James Finlay &amp; Co. in New Providence, a free port in the Bahamas, to supply South America, which alone made &pound;10,000 profit in its first year.<br>
<br>In 1812 Finlay used his election as MP for Glasgow burghs and as lord provost of Glasgow, and his status as chairman of the chamber of commerce, as a springboard to attack the trade monopoly of the East India Company. He formed the Glasgow East India Association to promote a national campaign for free trade, and, together with his friend and associate John Gladstone of Liverpool, persuaded government to curb the monopoly of the company and City of London. The cost of government subsidies to the East India Company to offset their territorial gains had not been accompanied by any increase in the company's Indian trade, and five select committees on East Indian affairs had reported inconclusively between 1804 and 1813. Thereafter the renewed charter of the East India Company (1813) permitted licensed free trading from the outports of Britain to compete with the company in India. Finlay and Gladstone immediately fitted out ships. Finlay's <i>Earl of Buckinghamshire</i> was the first ship from the Clyde to India. She sailed in 1816 with Ritchie and Steuart on board to set up a Finlay agency in Bombay; others were later established in Calcutta and Colombo. Two of Finlay's sons followed. To their surprise the initial cargo of Western luxury goods sold badly, but the makeweights of cheap cotton yarns and piece-goods were in great demand. Finlay realized that the potential market for light cottons could not be supplied by indigenous handworkers; his correspondent, Sir Thomas Munro, governor of Madras, confirmed both this and the great demand for cottons. A market greater than Europe opened out. After an initial loss, profits from these sales in India soon exceeded gross sales in all Finlay's other outlets in Europe and North and South America.<br>
<br>In 1795 Finlay married Janet Struthers, the sister of a Glasgow brewer; they had five sons followed by five daughters. He acquired the large estate of Auchwhillan, and in 1820, to the plans of the architect David Hamilton, built Castle Toward on the shores of the Clyde near Dunoon, where he was a pioneer in large-scale afforestation. His nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9464/', "George Finlay")</script> the philhellenist recalled a happy childhood there with his Finlay cousins. Finlay was a genial man, popular in social clubs, chairman of the Glasgow Gaelic Society and of the Glasgow Highland Society, which encouraged emigration. He was a JP, rector of Glasgow University, and chairman of the Clyde Navigation Trust. He was also a hard taskmaster in his cotton mills, and campaigned against the <span class="roman">Ten Hours Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Factory Act</span>. He declared his child workers were privileged as he supplied them with schooling after their day's work of ten hours, and he justified the lower wages paid to mill workers in Scotland, compared with those in Lancashire, because Scotland was healthier and the living cheaper. He put down strikes of textile workers in 1816&#150;17 and 1819&#150;20 with determination, employing spies to gather information about the then illegal trade unions, but not agents to stir trouble. He corresponded closely with Viscount Sidmouth as the Home Office's trusted source of information. However, he always held to the teachings of Adam Smith, and campaigned for freer trade which would lead to fuller employment and better working conditions. His was a brief parliamentary career, as member for Glasgow burghs from 1812 to 1818 and for Malmesbury from 1818 to 1820. Although he declined standing for Glasgow burghs in 1820 and was an unsuccessful candidate for Glasgow in 1830, government continued to consult him on commercial matters throughout his life. On the liberating of the China trade in 1833 he immediately sent a ship (the <i>Kirkman Finlay</i>) to Canton (Guangzhou), and opened in York Street the first tea warehouse in Glasgow, in partnership with a commodity broker, William Connel senior. He never traded in opium, a market he considered overstocked.<br>
<br>Finlay's old age was clouded with religious melancholia and sorrow over the consumption from which his daughters suffered. His youngest daughter was buried with him in Glasgow Cathedral. He died at Castle Toward on 4 March 1842, leaving James Finlay &amp; Co. prosperous but by then static; however, it has continued to diversify and trade from Glasgow under this name to the present. Finlay's epitaph in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> obituary was &#145;the beau-ideal of a Glasgow merchant&#146;.<br>
