<span class="headword">Todd,  Alpheus</span>  (1821&#150;1884), <span class="occ">librarian and constitutional historian in Canada</span>, the son of Henry Cooke Todd, an author, was born in London on 30 July 1821. He emigrated with his family to York, Upper Canada, in 1833, and the following year, when York was incorporated as Toronto, produced an <span class="italic">Engraved Plan of the City of Toronto</span>. This work brought him to the notice of the lawyer Robert Baldwin Sullivan, who helped him gain employment in the library of the house of assembly of Upper Canada in 1835, and in 1836 he became assistant librarian. Keenly interested in British parliamentary practice and its relevance to Canada, he published <span class="italic">The Practice and Privileges of the Two Houses of Parliament</span> (1840), which was officially adopted for the use of Canadian members, who hitherto had had no such guide. In 1841 Todd was made assistant librarian to the assembly of the united province of Canada, and subsequently was appointed constitutional adviser to both houses of the legislature, a task for which his intimate knowledge of parliamentary precedent made him admirably suited. In 1856 he visited Europe to restock the library, which had suffered two serious fires. His canny buying there and his subsequent additions left the library with 55,000 volumes by 1865. On his return from Europe in 1856 he was made chief librarian. In 1867 he was appointed librarian at Ottawa to the dominion parliament, an office which he held until his death, judiciously stocking and efficiently organizing the library.<br>
<br>Todd's most important published work was <span class="italic">On Parliamentary Government in England</span> (2 vols., 1867&#150;9), which met with acclaim at the time and soon ran to further editions and foreign-language translations. He sought to vindicate the power of the monarch and saw the rising tide of democracy with considerable foreboding. His work was extensively used in Britain and its dominions and in the development of parliamentary institutions in nineteenth-century Japan. Todd was special adviser in 1873 to the governor-general, Lord Dufferin, to whom he dedicated <span class="italic">Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies</span> (1880), which extended his study of the granting of responsible government by Britain to its possessions, particularly Canada, and in which he again stressed the continuing role of the crown, and therefore the governor-general.<br>
<br>In 1845 Todd married Sarah Anne St John. They had a daughter and four sons, one of whom, Arthur Hamlyn, edited second editions of his father's two main works and left an unpublished life of him. Todd was a keen student of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and in 1837 entered the ministry of the Catholic Apostolic church. He was dissuaded from giving up his secular appointment only by the arguments of the church authorities themselves. From 1874 he had charge of the apostolic congregation at Ottawa, and at one point during this time of a second in the United States.<br>
<br>In 1881 Todd was made honorary LLD of Queen's College, Kingston, and was created CMG. He died suddenly at Ottawa on 22 January 1884. Of humble parentage and largely self-taught, he influenced the practice of government over much of the British empire through his meticulously researched publications.<br>
