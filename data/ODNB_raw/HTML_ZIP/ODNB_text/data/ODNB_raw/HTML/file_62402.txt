<span class="headword">Balchin,  Nigel Marlin</span>  (1908&#150;1970), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 3 December 1908 at The Butts, Potterne, Wiltshire, the third of the three children of William Edwin Balchin (1872&#150;1958), grocer and master baker, and his wife, Ada Elizabeth Curtis (1870&#150;1939). Balchin was educated at Dauntsey's School, West Lavington, near Devizes in Wiltshire, and then as an exhibitioner and prizeman at Peterhouse, Cambridge, gaining a second in part one of the natural sciences tripos (1929) and graduating in 1930. At Cambridge he wrote short stories which were influenced by his scientific studies. After graduation he joined the National Institute of Industrial Psychology and became a consultant to J. S. Rowntree &amp; Son, the chocolate manufacturers in York. Here he pioneered a study of the psychology of the workplace to increase efficiency (he also claimed to be largely responsible for the marketing success of the Aero and Kit Kat chocolate bars).<br>
<br>On 21 January 1933 Balchin married Elisabeth Evelyn Walshe (1910&#150;1991) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49561/', "Ayrton, Elisabeth Evelyn")</script>], whom he had met in Cambridge where she was a student; she was the daughter of the writer Douglas Walshe, and was later a writer herself. The couple had three daughters, including Penelope Leach, the developmental child psychologist. In the mid-1930s Balchin developed a second career as a writer and became a regular contributor to <span class="italic">Punch</span>. Several articles for that journal were republished in book form as <span class="italic">How to Run a Bassoon Factory</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Business for Pleasure</span> (1935) under the pseudonym Mark Spade; both were satires on efficiency in the workplace, and drew on his work at Rowntrees. He also wrote three novels under his own name&#151;<span class="italic">No Sky</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Simple Life</span> (1935), and <span class="italic">Lightbody on Liberty</span> (1936), all critically successful&#151;and several stage plays.<br>
<br>Balchin joined the War Office as a psychologist in its personnel section in 1941 and went on to become deputy scientific adviser to the army council, attaining the rank of brigadier. His experience of the cynical machinations of government departments in wartime, and the internecine rivalries and skulduggery of civil service mandarins, were graphically portrayed in his fourth and fifth novels, <span class="italic">Darkness Falls from the Air</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">The Small Back Room</span> (1943). The latter was made into a film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger in 1949. They were riveting stories, with steadily mounting tension and drama, but they also acquired instant status as contemporary social documents. In detached, terse, unsentimental prose, bitterness and humour being deployed in equal measure, Balchin captured the authentic atmosphere of London during the blitz, especially from the viewpoint of those working in Whitehall. He interwove private lives and emotions with depictions of life in government offices; the frustration of those in the lower ranks, desperate to get things moving but fated to see fresh initiatives stifled, were contrasted with the Machiavellian manoeuvres of complacent senior civil servants and their masters, intent on maintaining their own positions. With the publication of these two books Balchin attained some prominence as a novelist. He was also popularly credited, in later years, with having coined the terms &#145;back room boy&#146; and &#145;boffin&#146;, although the evidence in support of these claims is not altogether conclusive.<br>
<br>With the ending of the war Balchin moved from London to Kent, and decided to become a full-time writer, though he retained business interests into the 1950s. He consolidated his success with <span class="italic">Mine Own Executioner</span> (1945), a cleverly developed tale of a psychoanalyst who, inspired initially with zeal and dedication, becomes disillusioned and goes sadly adrift in failing to prevent a steadily developing catastrophe. During the next ten years Balchin produced a novel on average every eighteen months, but these later works, while well crafted and usually quite absorbing, were not in the same league as their immediate predecessors. His output also included a number of short stories and some non-fiction work, and he continued to write plays.<br>
<br>By the late 1940s Balchin's marriage was over. A cordial m&eacute;nage with the artist Michael Ayrton and his partner Joan, with whom Balchin was having an affair, ended when Elisabeth and Ayrton fell in love (they married in 1952). Balchin's novel <span class="italic">A Way through the Wood</span> (1951) draws on this experience. Divorced from his first wife in 1951, Balchin married Yovanka Zorana Tomich (<i>b</i>. 1930), a Yugoslav refugee, on 5 February 1953; they had a son and a daughter. From 1952 until 1961 he devoted most of his attention to writing screenplays, at first in England and later in Hollywood. He received a BAFTA award for <span class="italic">The Man Who Never Was</span> (1956) and did some preliminary work on <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> (1963), but life in Hollywood soon palled owing to his growing reliance on alcohol. During the 1960s he wrote three more novels, including <span class="italic">Seen Dimly before Dawn</span> (1962), and some television plays.<br>
<br>In appearance Balchin was a tall, sparse man, with penetrating blue eyes and an erudite expression. In later life he grew a beard. He interested himself in a wide range of activities, including music, gardening, wood-carving, and all types of sport (polo excepted). He died from a coronary thrombosis and pneumonia in the Greenaway Nursing Home, Fellowes Road, Hampstead, London, on 17 May 1970. He was buried at Hampstead cemetery three days later. His wife survived him.<br>
