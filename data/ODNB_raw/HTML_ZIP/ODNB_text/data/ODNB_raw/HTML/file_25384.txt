<span class="headword">Sherman,  Edward</span>  (1776&#150;1866), <span class="occ">coach proprietor</span>, was the son of Edward Staniford Sherman and his wife, Mary, and was born in Berkshire and baptized at South Moreton, near Wallingford, Berkshire, on 16 January 1777. It was later recorded that he went to London on foot in 1793, being too poor to pay the fare, and obtained employment at 12<i>s</i>. a week. It has been claimed that he owed his advancement either to success as a stockbroker, or to friendship with Lewis Levy, the great toll lessee and stockbroker, but this rests entirely on later evidence, particularly the fact that Sherman later &#145;dealt largely&#146; in stocks  (<span class="italic">City Press</span>, 29 Sept 1866, 5).<br>
<br>More credibly, it was stated in 1907 that Sherman married three old and wealthy ladies in succession; the widow who owned the Oxford Arms inn, Warwick Lane, London, followed by her sister, and then the sister's niece. It is certainly the case that, at St Martin Ludgate on 6 August 1803, Sherman, then a bachelor of the parish of St Luke Middlesex, married Ann Palmer, a widow, and on 5 October 1803 he became a member of the Innholders' Company in respect of the Oxford Arms inn, Warwick Lane. However, no subsequent marriage can be traced until 1849, and the date of Ann Sherman's death is unknown.<br>
<br>Sherman's move to the Bull and Mouth, Aldersgate Street, about 1823, brought him to the forefront of the coach trade. By the 1830s his coach business was the third largest in London, with 700 horses at its peak. In 1836 he had sixty-one coaches, including ten mail coaches, leaving London every day. Sherman himself was never seen driving a coach, and was later described as &#145;not a horsey man&#146;  (Harper, 1.37). He originated the long-distance day coaches; in particular, the Wonder to Shrewsbury, performing the 158 mile journey in fifteen and three-quarter hours, set a new standard in 1825. It was followed by the Telegraph to Manchester in 1833 (186 miles in eighteen and a half hours). His coaches had distinctive yellow wheels and bodies, and, unusually, he owned some himself instead of hiring them. He rebuilt the Bull and Mouth (as the Queen's Hotel) in 1830, with extensive underground stabling. He was also a promoter, and then a director, of the <i>Thames</i>, the first steam packet plying between London and Margate in 1814.<br>
<br>Harper, writing in 1907, stated that:<blockquote>Without doubt a man of strong character, he had many peculiarities, among them a decided taste for extravagance in dress and jewellery, remarkable even at that time &hellip; instead of sporting a shirt front, his chest displayed an expanse of black satin, plentifully covered with diamond pins. (Harper, 1.43&#150;4)</blockquote>Sherman was apparently unpopular with his country partners, who had difficulty obtaining their share of the earnings from him.<br>
<br>Sherman was the slowest of the great coach proprietors to adapt to the railways. When the Grand Junction Railway opened in 1838 he kept some of his coaches working along its route, not only losing heavily on them, but also forfeiting the opportunity to become one of the railway's agents. However, this does not seem to have diminished his prosperity significantly. Certainly by 1839 he was aware that, where railways existed, only the poor or the timid would travel by coach, and the number of people too timid to use railways was rapidly declining. He later worked omnibuses between Paddington and Bank, and he remained the proprietor of the Queen's Hotel. He was said to have been a shareholder in some of the earliest railways.<br>
<br>Sherman's last wife was Isabella, daughter of Thomas Hunt, whom he married at Christ Church, London, on 14 October 1849. She survived him. No children are recorded in Sherman's will, although he was reputed to have illegitimate children. According to Harper, his family took advantage of his eccentricities to commit him, without reasonable cause, to Bethlem Hospital. He died at an asylum in Chiswick known as the Manor House, on 14 September 1866.<br>
