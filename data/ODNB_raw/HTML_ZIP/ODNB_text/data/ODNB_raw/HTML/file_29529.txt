<span class="headword">Williams,  (Maria) Jane</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Llinos]</span>  (1795&#150;1873), <span class="occ">singer and compiler of traditional Welsh music</span>, was almost certainly born at Aberpergwm House in the Vale of Neath, Glamorgan, south Wales, where her family had lived for generations. She was the daughter of Rees Williams (1755&#150;1812), a landowner, businessman, and coal master, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jenkins (<i>c</i>.1759&#150;1834). Aberpergwm had an ancient association with poetry, and Rees Williams is thought to have been the last Welshman to uphold the tradition of employing a household poet, Dafydd Nicholas. Jane Williams had her first education at home before attending a school in Swansea with her sister, Elizabeth Ann (1794&#150;1871), who was to be her lifelong companion. She was taught the harp later in life by the English harpist Elias Parish Alvars; at some point she also learned the guitar.<br>
<br>The Williams family moved in Anglo-Welsh London society, particularly when the sisters were young and marriageable (although neither, in fact, ever married). Jane, it seems, was a vivacious young woman who enjoyed the attention she received for her musical talents: her soprano singing voice was distinctive and widely acclaimed. It is not entirely clear how she acquired the name Llinos (the Welsh for linnet), but her obituary in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> refers to her unwillingness to be called by the more flattering name Eos (nightingale). It was her singing and playing which apparently brought her to the attention of Lady Llanover, one of the most prominent figures in that social circle, with whom Jane kept up a friendship throughout her adult life. Williams appears to have met the author Crofton Croker in 1826 while returning from a visit to Ireland. She introduced him to the fairy legends of Cwm Nedd, which he later included in his book <span class="italic">Irish Fairy Legends</span> (1828). They continued to correspond on their mutual interest in Celtic myth and legend.<br>
<br>With her sister and brother William (1788&#150;1855), Jane Williams was associated with the Welsh literary society Y Cymreigyddion Y Fenni and the Abergavenny eisteddfod, which it instituted in the 1830s. Aberpergwm House and nearby Ynys-las, at Blaen-gwrach (to which the sisters moved on William's marriage in 1837), became a lively focus for their &#145;Celtic renaissance&#146; circle. Jane competed at Abergavenny, but there are conflicting accounts of her victories. She probably won in 1838 for an arrangement of a Welsh air for four voices, and a year earlier for the best collection of unpublished Welsh music. This was to be published as <span class="italic">Ancient Airs of Gwent and Morgannwg</span> (1844), the collection of folk-songs for which she is best remembered. She was considered an authority by her contemporaries and was consulted by them on matters pertaining to folk-songs, but her authority has been challenged by modern scholars. Some have suggested that the contribution of her sister to her published work has not been fairly recognized, and others claim that her texts were sent to John Jones (Tegid) and Taliesin Williams (ab Iolo) for rendering into more refined Welsh. Her practice of providing only abbreviated versions of song texts has also been criticized. But Jane Williams was undoubtedly one of the first Welsh women to gain a close understanding of the country's poetic and musical traditions through a systematic study of songs.<br>
<br>Jane Williams died on 10 November 1873 at Ynys-las. She was buried on 15 November with Elizabeth Ann, who had died two years earlier, in the family vault in Aberpergwm church, where a simple plaque commemorated the lives of the sisters. She had lived most of her later life in a small area of Wales, and her principal interest was in the cultural heritage of her own country. Therefore, despite the later criticism of her work, it is a mark of her achievement that her death was widely reported not just in Wales, but in major English newspapers such as <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. It is clear from contemporary writings about her that her endeavours as a scholar, together with her unmannered brilliance as a singer, were matched by a kind and lively personality.<br>
