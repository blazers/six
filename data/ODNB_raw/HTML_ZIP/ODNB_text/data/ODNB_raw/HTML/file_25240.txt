<span class="headword">Sharples,  James</span>  (1751/2&#150;1811), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born into a Roman Catholic family in Lancashire. His brother, Henry, became a timber merchant in Liverpool and a half-sister, Mrs Talbot, was subprioress in a Catholic school. His parents sent him to study for the priesthood in France, but he decided instead to become an artist. A bequest from an uncle possibly assisted him in this decision. He may have studied with George Romney, and in 1774 he exhibited a portrait and two miniatures at the first exhibition of the Liverpool Society of Artists, when his address was given as Duke Street, Liverpool. From 1779 to 1785 he occasionally exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy. In 1781 he advertised himself as a &#145;Portrait Painter in Oil and Crayons&#146; in the <span class="italic">Bristol Advertizer</span> (28 July 1781), and exhibited in Bristol &#145;upwards of one hundred specimens of known characters&#146;  (Miles, 725). By 1785 he had moved to London and married twice. The sons of his first and second marriages, George and Felix Thomas (1786&#150;1832&times;49), both became artists. After his second wife's death Sharples returned to Liverpool, where about 1787 he married Ellen Wallace (1769&#150;1849) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25242/', "Sharples, Rolinda")</script>], a Quaker. She had been his pupil in Bath. Their two children, James junior (<i>c</i>.1788&#150;1839) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25242/', "Rolinda Sharples (1793&#150;1838)")</script> both became artists.<br>
<br>In 1793 Sharples set out with his young family for the United States of America. After a delay of seven months, when their ship was interned at Brest after being captured by a privateer, they arrived in New York. They settled in Philadelphia, where Sharples executed small profile portraits, mostly in pastels. The American painter William Dunlap recorded that Sharples carried letters of introduction to<blockquote>persons distinguished, either military, civil or literary, with a request to paint their portraits for his collection. This being granted, and the portrait finished in about two hours, the likeness generally induced an order for a copy, and brought as sitters all who saw it. His price for the profile was $15; and for the full-face (never so good) $20. (Miles, 725)</blockquote>Ellen Miles notes that:<blockquote>The portraits were on thick, textured, gray paper measuring about nine by seven inches. The outlines of the bust-length portraits were apparently drawn with a mechanical instrument to ensure physiognomic accuracy. The powdered colors, applied with a fine brush, were predominantly black, gray, and white, with flesh tones for the faces and blue for the backgrounds. (ibid.)</blockquote>His earliest recorded commissions were from George Washington in 1796. These included portraits of Washington himself (National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; City of Bristol Museum; two pastel copies after Sharples, NPG; a copy by Ellen Sharples, Yale University Art Gallery); Motier Lafayette, the son of the marquis de Lafayette; and the president's wife, Martha, and adopted grandson, George Washington Parke Custis. Other sitters included Alexander Hamilton (1755/7&#150;1804), Gouverneur Morris (1752&#150;1816), and the chemist Joseph Priestley (all National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution). James and Dolley Madison and Thomas Jefferson also sat to Sharples in Philadelphia. In her diary Ellen Sharples noted that &#145;copies were frequently required; these I undertook and was so far successful as to have as many commissions as I could execute; they were thought equal to the originals, price the same&#146;  (ibid.). Her long-continued practice of making replicas has sometimes confused attempts to attribute individual works to Sharples.<br>
<br>After working in New York from October 1797 to 1801, when his name sometimes appears in trade directories as Sharpless, concern about the possibility of war between England and France led Sharples to return with his family to England. He continued to take likenesses and to exhibit his American portraits. His sons James and Felix returned to America in 1806 and worked as pastel portraitists in New York state and in Virginia. Sharples returned with his wife and daughter in 1809, settling in New York. He made working visits to Niagara Falls and Philadelphia but his health deteriorated, and he died in New York as a result of a heart attack on 26 February 1811, and was buried in St Peter's Roman Catholic Church in the city. Ellen offered for sale his collection of portraits of distinguished Americans in the New York <span class="italic">Public Advertizer</span> (6 April&#150;10 July 1811) and returned to England with Rolinda and James junior. Felix Sharples remained in the United States and had died by 1849 in North Carolina. His collection of his father's unsold portraits is now at Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia. The portraits retained by Ellen Sharples went first to the Bristol Fine Arts Academy and are now in Bristol City Art Gallery. These include portraits of Sir Humphrey Davy, Sir William Herschel, William Godwin, and Robert Southey. Further examples of his work are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and Boston Museum.<br>
<br>Dunlap, who sat to Sharples, thought his works &#145;strikingly like&#146; and described him as &#145;a plain, well-disposed man [who] accumulated property by honest industry, and uncommon facility with his materials&#146;  (Miles, 726). His interest in the application of mechanical aids to his art also led him to take out patents in England on three designs for machinery in 1791, 1802, and 1804. He also designed a special carriage to carry his family and working materials in America. His portraits of American sitters continue to be appreciated not only for their strikingly accurate likenesses, but for recording prominent figures of historical importance, particularly leaders of the American War of Independence.<br>
