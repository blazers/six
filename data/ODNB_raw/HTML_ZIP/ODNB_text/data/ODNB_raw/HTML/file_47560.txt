<span class="headword">Hillman,  Edward Henry</span>  (1889&#150;1934), <span class="occ">transport entrepreneur</span>, was born on 19 March 1889 in Croydon, Surrey, the son of Edward Hillman and his wife, Annie. He left school at the age of nine, and worked as a brush maker. He joined the army as a drummer boy at the age of twelve. The First World War saw him rise to the rank of sergeant-major in a cavalry regiment, and also provided him with a gratuity on demobilization, which he used to buy a taxi. Success in this venture led to the sale of the cab and the purchase of a cycle shop in Romford with the proceeds. Suburban Essex remained his base, from which he built up a deserved reputation as a thorn in the side of the existing transport establishment.<br>
<br>It is said that Hillman's entry into the motor coach business arose from his taking a booking agency for a local firm, the commission showing him the profits that could be made from running his own service. In December 1928 he started to run a service between Stratford Broadway and Brentwood, with a garage and office at 52B Romford Road, Stratford. This was an immediate success, being faster and cheaper than the existing bus services. By the summer of 1931 he had extended the route to serve Clacton, Ipswich, Norwich, Southwold, and Yarmouth, offering short-stage fares between all points, to the irritation of local bus operators.<br>
<br>Hillman had entered the industry relatively late in its period of expansion, and when route licensing began in 1931 he faced considerable opposition in the new traffic courts. This, and the establishment of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1934 (which had been foreseen for some years), may have influenced his diversion into air transport. The compulsory acquisition of sixty-five of his ninety-three coaches on 10 January 1934 would have provided an input of capital, but it was on 1 April 1932 that he started an air service between Maylands airfield, near Romford, and Clacton-on-Sea, with a three-seater Puss Moth aircraft. In the following season he reinstated the Clacton service, and started to fly to Margate, and to Paris. In 1934, with all-year operation developing, he moved his base to what was later to become RAF Stapleford Tawney, at Abridge, near Chigwell, and obtained a Post Office mail contract for a service to Belfast, later extended to Glasgow. On the Paris service he undercut the fares charged by Imperial Airways and Air France, but his operating standards were high, and his airline had only one fatal accident.<br>
<br>The de Havilland DH-84 Dragon airliner was Hillman's favoured machine, and he claimed that it had been designed to his specifications. He was also closely associated with the manufacturers of Gilford coaches, and his home in Romford was called Gilford Lodge. He was exceptional among airline operators in his practice of managing aircraft in the same way that he managed his coaches. There is a telling anecdote of Hillman on a bank holiday, standing in his shirtsleeves on the tarmac, pushing a mug of tea into the hand of one of his pilots, and telling him to &#145;get back to Paris and do another relief&#146;  (private information). Not only was he ready to drive his own coaches, he also learned to fly, so that he knew what he was expecting of his staff.<br>
<br>Late in 1934 Hillman's Airways was floated, with an authorized capital of &pound;150,000. Hillman intended to be managing director and deputy chairman for at least seven years. With this injection of new capital, further ventures were to be expected, but the promise was cut off by his untimely death. His interest in the company was acquired by the bankers, D'Erlanger, and subsequently Whitehall Securities merged the company with other independents to form British Airways, the government's second &#145;chosen instrument&#146; (the first having been Imperial Airways). The coach services, which he had continued to operate, were sold to the Eastern National and Eastern Counties Omnibus companies, who removed the local fare stages, thus increasing fares for short-distance travellers.<br>
<br>Hillman was always a rough diamond, who could at times be moody and intolerant. What sets him off against the general run of entrepreneurs in the transport business is the combination of hands-on management and strategic insight, which might have changed the nature of air transport by offering frequent, low-cost services over domestic routes. He died at his home, Gilford Lodge, Hare Street, Gidea Park, Romford, Essex, on 31 December 1934, of a heart attack and stroke. He was survived by his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> White, and their son Edward.<br>
