<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cavalcanti,  Alberto de Almeida</span>  (1897&#150;1982), <span class="occ">film director and producer</span>, was born in Dona Marciana Street, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 6 February 1897, the youngest son of Captain Manoel de Almeida Cavalcanti (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1920) and his wife, Dona Ana Olinda do Rego Rangel (<i>d</i>. 1945). His father, of Italian descent, taught mathematics at the military school of Praia Vermelha. His mother came from an artistic family; an uncle, Alberto Rangel, was a leading novelist of the period.<br>
<br>Like his elder brothers, Cavalcanti was sent to military school in Rio de Janeiro, but he showed little aptitude for army life. Nor did law suit him: in 1913 he was enrolled at the law faculty of the Rio de Janeiro Polytechnic College, but after less than a year he quarrelled with his professor and quit. Aged seventeen, he left for Geneva to study architecture, and spent three years there before moving to Paris and the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts in 1918. Having graduated, he joined an architectural practice, but found the work boring and poorly paid. On both counts the cinema offered greater attractions. Around this time Cavalcanti's father died. He had always been closer to his mother, who now became his frequent companion until her death in 1945. Thirty years later he dedicated his book <span class="italic">Film and Reality</span> to her memory. A homosexual, Cavalcanti never married.<br>
<br>Cavalcanti entered films as art director on Marcel l'Herbier's unfinished version of Tolstoy's <span class="italic">Resurrection</span> (1922), and made his directorial d&eacute;but with <span class="italic">Le train sans yeux</span> (1925). This was impounded when the producers ran out of money. To replace it, Cavalcanti hastily improvised <span class="italic">Rien que les heures</span> (1926), an impressionistic study of twenty-four hours in the life of Paris. Poetic, quirky, and humorous, it made his reputation and influenced other &#145;city films&#146; of the period, such as Walter Ruttmann's <span class="italic">Berlin: Symphony of a Great City</span> and Dziga Vertov's <span class="italic">The Man with a Movie Camera</span>. Cavalcanti followed it up with <span class="italic">En rade</span> (1927), a feature about a young man wandering through a busy seaport which in mood and treatment anticipated the &#145;poetic realism&#146; of the 1930s. Now rated one of the foremost avant-garde directors, he completed several more features and short films before the coming of sound disrupted his career.<br>
<br>&#145;The producers thought that [sound] films should be made by stage directors&#146;, Cavalcanti later recalled. &#145;The results were pitiful and we were called back to the studios very quickly&#146;  (Hillier, Lovell, and Rohdie, 36). But the only work he could find was at Paramount's Paris studios, directing French and Portuguese-language versions of Hollywood comedies. After a few years of this soulless toil, &#145;I did what I have done many times in my long life, I said I was sick and I came to London to recover&#146;  (ibid.). There he met John Grierson, leader of the British documentary school and head of the General Post Office (GPO) film unit. Cavalcanti's stint at Paramount had given him expertise in sound technique, which the GPO unit lacked; Grierson invited him to join them at their Blackheath studio &#145;for a few months&#146;. In the event he stayed for seven years, working as director, producer, and, above all, mentor to the other film-makers in the unit.<br>
<br>According to Harry Watt, the arrival of Cavalcanti was &#145;the turning point of British documentary. If I've had any success in films I put it down to my training from Cavalcanti and I think a lot of other people should say the same thing&#146;  (Sussex, &#145;Cavalcanti&#146;, 207). Others who benefited from Cavalcanti's enthusiasm and professional expertise included Humphrey Jennings, Basil Wright, Len Lye, and Norman McLaren. Exact credits for the films Cavalcanti contributed to are hard to establish, since the GPO unit worked collaboratively; besides, Cavalcanti later claimed, he was often denied credit by the aesthetically austere Grierson, who looked with suspicion on Cavalcanti's playful, surrealist-tinged approach. Relations between the two men were edgy: according to Cavalcanti, Grierson &#145;only came to the studios to upset my work&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>None the less, Cavalcanti soon settled in. &#145;The GPO was a very nice place to work &hellip; The atmosphere was much better than it had been in France&#146;  (Hillier, Lovell, and Rohdie, 43). He took directorial credit on some of the unit's less remembered films: <span class="italic">Pett and Pott</span> (1934), a jokey fantasy supposedly promoting thrift; <span class="italic">Coalface</span> (1936), which with poetry by W. H. Auden and music by Benjamin Britten acted as a dry run for <span class="italic">Night Mail</span>; and <span class="italic">Line to Tcherva Hut</span> (1937), about phone services in the Alps. But Cavalcanti was closely involved, as producer and sound supervisor, on many of the unit's most famous productions, such as <span class="italic">Song of Ceylon</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Night Mail</span> (1936). Basil Wright, credited director on both, paid him grateful tribute: &#145;His ideas about the use of sound were so liberating that they would liberate in you about a thousand other ideas&#146;  (Sussex, &#145;Cavalcanti&#146;, 207).<br>
<br>When Grierson left in 1937 to join the Film Centre (advising Commonwealth governments on film), Cavalcanti took over as head of the unit. Under his guidance the centre produced some fifteen films, including Harry Watt's best pre-war work, <span class="italic">North Sea</span> (1938), and the first of Humphrey Jennings's masterpieces of documentary poetry, <span class="italic">Spare Time</span> (1939). When war broke out the GPO unit was transferred to the Ministry of Information and renamed the Crown Film Unit. Since the ministry had little idea what the unit should do, Cavalcanti led his staff out into the streets to capture the sights and sounds of London as it adjusted to the coming of war. <span class="italic">The First Days</span> (1939), with its quiet, understated air of determination, set the tone of &#145;the people's war&#146; that would become the main theme of British wartime propaganda.<br>
<br>Unfortunately Cavalcanti, who lacked Grierson's skill at dealing with officialdom, found himself in an equivocal position as a foreign national. Pressure was put on him to relinquish his Brazilian citizenship; instead he quit the unit in 1940, and accepted an invitation from Michael Balcon to join <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93789', "Ealing Studios")</script>. Though a commercial studio, Ealing was to Cavalcanti &#145;an absolute parallel to the GPO&#146;  (Hillier, Lovell, and Rohdie, 45). Under Balcon's benevolent rule he continued to direct and produce documentaries such as <span class="italic">Yellow Caesar</span> (1941), a virulent attack on Mussolini. He also resumed directing feature films for the first time since leaving France. <span class="italic">Went the Day Well?</span> (1942), based loosely on a short story by Graham Greene, vividly imagined a sleepy English village taken over by undercover German paratroopers. By contrast, <span class="italic">Champagne Charlie</span> (1944) celebrated the robust culture of the Victorian music-halls. Cavalcanti masterminded, and part-directed, <span class="italic">Dead of Night</span> (1945), a chilling anthology of ghost stories. His last feature for Ealing, <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> (1947), was a workmanlike adaptation of Dickens that paled beside David Lean's two masterpieces.<br>
<br>As at the GPO, Cavalcanti's significance at Ealing extended far beyond the films he himself directed; the character of the studio in its most famous manifestation was as much his creation as Balcon's. Several members of the unit followed him to Ealing, notably Harry Watt and Robert Hamer, and he acted as mentor to other young recruits such as Charles Crichton, Charles Frend, and the cinematographer Douglas Slocombe. His influence on Ealing's wartime output was crucial: the switch from the stilted, stagey films produced early in the war to gritty, realist works such as <span class="italic">Next of Kin</span> and <span class="italic">San Demetrio London</span> owed much to his inspiration. Monia Danischewsky, Ealing's publicity officer turned producer, wrote &#145;If Mick [Balcon] was the father figure, Cavalcanti was the Nanny who brought us up &hellip; a natural if inarticulate teacher&#146;  (Danischewsky, 134). At moments of excitement, Cavalcanti's strong Brazilian accent and fractured syntax could run wild; on one occasion, accused of underlighting a scene, he retorted, &#145;I 'ave been making films in France for years and years when nobody could see nothing and everybody was delighted&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Balcon, generous with opportunities, was frugal with money, and in 1946 Cavalcanti left Ealing, hoping for richer pickings as a freelance film-maker. His first independent film, <span class="italic">They Made me a Fugitive</span> (1947), was a remarkably tough crime drama about a bored former serviceman (Trevor Howard) drawn into the Soho gang world, a rare example of British <i>film noir</i>. But his next two films&#151;<span class="italic">The First Gentleman</span> (1947), a costume drama about the prince regent, and another crime drama, <span class="italic">For them that Trespass</span> (1948)&#151;did poorly. When a deal with the Rank Organisation fell through in 1950, Cavalcanti accepted an invitation from Brazil to lecture at the Museum of Modern Art in S&atilde;o Paulo.<br>
<br>There followed what Cavalcanti called &#145;an unhappy adventure&#146;  (Sussex, &#145;Cavalcanti&#146;, 211). Hoping to create his native country's first film industry, he became production chief of the newly formed Vera Cruz film company. But he encountered hostility and obstruction on all sides, not least from powerful Hollywood interests who whispered that he was a communist. He struggled on for four years, directing three films&#151;of which the best was <span class="italic">O canto de mar</span> (<span class="italic">The Song of the Sea</span>, 1954), a compassionate study of impoverished peasants&#151;before giving up and returning to Europe. From then on Cavalcanti worked as a peripatetic film-maker in Austria, East Germany, Romania, Britain, Israel, and France. His films included: a Brecht adaptation, <span class="italic">Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti</span> (1955), which Brecht called the only faithful version of his work ever filmed; a children's film in Britain, <span class="italic">The Monster of Highgate Pond</span> (1960); and <span class="italic">Thus Spake Theodor Herzl</span> (1967), a tribute to the founder of Israel. In his later years Cavalcanti settled in Paris, where he directed for television and the stage. He died there, at a clinic in rue de Passy, from a cardiac seizure on 23 August 1982.<br>
