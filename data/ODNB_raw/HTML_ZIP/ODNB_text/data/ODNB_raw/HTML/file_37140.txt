<span class="headword">Badlesmere, Sir  Bartholomew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1275&#150;1322), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son and heir of Guncelin of Badlesmere (<i>d</i>. 1301), of Badlesmere, Kent, and an unknown mother. Like his father, who was a royal banneret and justice of Chester from 1274 to 1281, Badlesmere made his way in the world through service to the crown. First summoned to serve in Gascony in 1294, he accompanied Edward I to Flanders in 1297, fought at Falkirk in 1298, and by 1299 was one of the king's household knights. His representing Kent in the Carlisle parliament of 1307 was a mark of corresponding importance in his own <i>pays</i>. Edward II's accession later that year accelerated his rise. He was made constable of Bristol Castle in August 1307, and began to receive numerous royal grants. Only in 1310&#150;12, during the prolonged crisis caused by the opposition of the reforming ordainers to the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston, did his loyalties waver. He was among those barons who petitioned Edward for reform in March 1310, and in 1312 he was ordered to surrender Bristol Castle, probably the sign of a more open opposition. But after Gaveston's execution in June 1312 he returned to a more comfortable position at the king's side.<br>
<br>By this time Badlesmere had a firm place in baronial society. His early connections had been with Henry de Lacy, fifth earl of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1311), whose retainer he was by October 1300, and with the northern magnate Robert Clifford, lord of Westmorland (<i>d</i>. 1314), with whom he served in Edward I's later Scottish campaigns. He had a closer association with Gilbert de Clare, eighth earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1314), perhaps resulting from his marriage, before 30 June 1308, to Gloucester's cousin, Margaret de Umfraville, <i>n&eacute;e</i> de Clare, the widow of the eldest son of the earl of Angus. As Gloucester's knight he earned an ignominious name at Bannockburn in 1314 when he left his lord to be killed in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.<br>
<br>Badlesmere was by now one of the king's chief councillors and lieutenants. Together with Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1324), often his partner in these years, he led an expedition to the north in 1315; in 1316 he took a major role in the suppression of the Welsh rising of Llewelyn Bren (Llywelyn ap Rhys), and also of the disturbances that broke out in that year at Bristol, which constituted a revolt by the townsmen against Badlesmere himself. In the same year he was among the committee of bishops and magnates appointed to reform the royal household. In September 1316 Edward retained him for a very large fee in return for the promise of his service with a commensurately large retinue; and shortly afterwards he and Pembroke set off for the papal curia on a mission that had the repeal of the ordinances as one of its objectives.<br>
<br>All these activities point to Badlesmere's standing at Edward's court. He was, however, on the court's moderate wing. In 1317 he and Pembroke combined to restrain the most avaricious of the courtiers, Roger Damory (<i>d</i>. 1322), in order to placate the court's leading opponent, Thomas, earl of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1322); and he went on to play a part in the negotiations with Lancaster that culminated in the treaty of Leake in 1318. But his appointment as steward of the royal household in November 1318 was both a snub to Lancaster, who claimed the right of appointment, and a mark of his growing association with Hugh Despenser the younger (<i>d</i>. 1326), the chamberlain of the household and the rising star at court. He remained very close to Edward, particularly as the king's negotiator with the Scots, until June 1321, when, at Sherburn in Yorkshire, he deserted to the baronial party which was forming against the two Despensers. Resentment at the younger Despenser's dominance at court, and his own links with the marchers who formed the core of the opposition&#151;his daughter Elizabeth married the son and heir of Roger (IV) Mortimer, lord of Wigmore (<i>d</i>. 1326), in 1316&#151;may account for this dramatic change of sides. But although Badlesmere even engaged in forgery in his efforts to discredit the younger Despenser, the fabrication was detected and he achieved nothing. Lancaster, the opposition's leader, refused to receive him and Badlesmere returned to Kent. There his wife's exclusion of Queen Isabella from Leeds Castle in October 1321 inaugurated the short and violent civil war that ended with Lancaster's defeat at Boroughbridge on 16&#150;17 March 1322. Badlesmere fought with the rebels at Boroughbridge, but escaped, only to be captured and subsequently hanged and decapitated in Canterbury on 14 April 1322.<br>
<br>Badlesmere left one son, Giles (1314&#150;1338), and four daughters. Through the favour of the king and of the earl of Gloucester he had built up a large estate in Kent and elsewhere: a royal grant of 1315 enumerates lands in forty-six places spread through eight counties. To judge by his employment, he was an able man, who owed his promotion to both his diplomatic and military skills and his energetic acquisitiveness. That such a natural loyalist should have met a traitor's end reflects all Edward II's failings as a political manager.<br>
