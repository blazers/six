<span class="headword">Fisher, Sir  Henry Arthur Pears <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1918&#150;2005), <span class="occ">barrister, judge, and college head</span>, was born at The Hall, Repton, Derbyshire, on 20 January 1918, the eldest of six sons of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31108/', "Revd Geoffrey Francis Fisher (1887&#150;1972)")</script>, then headmaster of Repton School, and his wife, Rosamond Chevallier, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forman, daughter of the Revd Arthur Forman, a former master at Repton. Geoffrey Fisher later became bishop of Chester, bishop of London, and finally, in 1945, archbishop of Canterbury; he was made a life peer, as Baron Fisher of Lambeth, on retirement in 1961. On both sides of the family Fisher was descended from long lines of clerics and schoolmasters. His paternal great-great-grandfather, great-grandfather, and grandfather were all rectors of Higham on the Hill, Leicestershire, in continuous succession from 1792 to 1910. His great-grandfather on his mother's side was Steuart Adolphus Pears, the dynamic headmaster of Repton from 1854 to 1874, who created the modern school, and his great-great-grandfather was the Revd James Pears, headmaster of Bath grammar school. It might have been expected that with such an ancestry Harry Fisher would himself have gone into the church or become a schoolmaster. In the event, in his public life at least, he manifested a total lack of religious belief. Nor did he feel any call to be a schoolmaster. The fact that three of his brothers did become headmasters of public schools sufficiently perpetuated the family tradition.<h2>
<a name="Warserviceandthebar"></a>War service and the bar</h2>Fisher was educated at Marlborough College (where his father had also been a pupil and, for a short period, a master) then Christ Church, Oxford, where he won the Gaisford Greek prose prize in 1937 and obtained a first in classical moderations in 1938. The advent of the Second World War compelled him after one and a half years to take a war-shortened (unclassified) degree. In 1940 he joined the Leicestershire regiment. While an officer cadet he displayed his characteristic independence of mind by refusing to attend church parade on the ground that he was an agnostic. He was posted to India and served also in Burma and Malaya. He went to the Staff College in Quetta in 1943, became a GSO2 in that year and GSO1 at the headquarters of the Fourteenth Army in 1945. He was mentioned in dispatches &#145;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Burma&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 9 May 1946).<br>
<br>Demobilized in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, Fisher decided to read for the bar and was called by the Inner Temple in 1947. The previous year he had entered the prize fellowship examination at All Souls College. He applied as a candidate in law, notwithstanding the fact that he had not read for a law degree. (A college tradition holds that he received from an Oxford law don a reading list and expert advice as to the type of questions that might be put by the law examiners.) His successful election in November 1946 began a long connection with the college, in various different categories of fellowship. Between 1961 and 1966 he held the office of estates bursar, an appointment that coincided with most of the period when he was heavily engaged as a silk, appearing regularly in court, and giving advice in weighty matters. On 18 December 1948, at the Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer, Chelsea, he had married Felicity Sutton, a 26-year-old artist, and daughter of Eric Sutton, author. They had one son and three daughters. The marriage was extremely happy and Felicity gave Harry continuous support in all his activities.<br>
<br>Fisher was a junior counsel from 1946 to 1960. Much of the work was of a standard commercial type, though some specialist cases came his way. Thus when the coal industry was nationalized he became involved in claims for compensation for expropriation. Another unusual area in which he was briefed concerned the liability of the Air Ministry as the owner of rectorial property to pay a share of the costs of repairing the chancel of the local parish church (<i>Chivers &amp; Sons Ltd v. Air Ministry</i>, 1955). Fisher, who was briefed by the Treasury solicitor, always claimed that he was instructed in this abstruse matter because he was the son of the archbishop of Canterbury and could be assumed to be a master of ecclesiastical law. Sadly this was not true and Fisher had to carry out much antiquarian research in his attempt (ultimately unsuccessful) to protect the Air Ministry from the claim.<br>
<br>In 1960 Fisher took silk. His first major brief arrived out of the blue in January 1961. He had about ten days in which to prepare for a case in the restrictive practices court on behalf of the cement manufacturers. He was ready to open the case on time and after a three-week hearing won the case. It brought Fisher's name to the attention of solicitors, and he became much in demand. However, he did not confine himself to his own work but deployed his energy and skills on behalf of the profession. After service on the Bar Council he was chairman of the bar from 1966 to 1968. He was also recorder of Canterbury from 1962. He was asked to act as counsel in one case where two senior silks had in succession returned the brief on accepting appointment to the bench (first Fred Lawton, next Stanley Rees). When Fisher met the client he observed: &#145;You have been unfortunate in your choice of counsel&#146;, to which came the reply, &#145;We don't have to worry with you. Your clerk says you will never be a judge&#146;  (private information). Though true for the particular case this prophecy was not fulfilled.<h2>
<a name="HighCourtandresignation"></a>High Court, and resignation</h2>At the beginning of 1968 Fisher accepted appointment as a High Court judge, in the Queen's Bench Division. He did not take the oath on appointment. Instead he affirmed. His tenure of office was short and there was hardly time for him to make his mark on the law. He was in any event unsympathetic to innovative decision-making by judges. Law reform he thought was a matter for the Law Commission and parliament. However, in July 1968 he was the junior member in a Court of Appeal decision that quashed the conviction for obscenity entered against the publishers of <span class="italic">Last Exit to Brooklyn</span>. This case sounded the death knell for prosecutions on the ground of obscenity of books with literary merit (real or plausibly claimed).<br>
<br>As a judge Fisher spent much of his time out of London on circuit. During the day he would try criminal cases and in the evening he was expected to entertain official guests in the company of his fellow judges. This lifestyle proved to be totally unsatisfying for him. In particular he sorely missed the intellectual challenge of arguing complex cases as counsel. He concluded that he had made a mistake and resigned from his judicial appointment at the end of July 1970. There is reason to believe that his first preference would have been to return to practice at the bar but there was a convention at the time that prevented this, so instead he took up a directorship of J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bankers, at the invitation of his friend Gordon Richardson (later governor of the Bank of England). Ignoring the traditional advice, &#145;Never explain, never apologize&#146;, he wrote a letter to many of his friends to explain his decision:<blockquote>I am not resigning on the ground of ill health. I am not resigning in protest about anything. I have not been asked to resign. Nothing disreputable has occurred. I am resigning because I find judicial work uncongenial, and I do not enjoy the life which Judges are expected to lead &hellip; I find a Judge's life a dull life, and I have found myself becoming dull as a result. The art of advocacy is a fascinating one to practise, but to sit and listen day after day to other people's advocacy I find a wearisome ordeal.</blockquote>He had given much consideration to the question: &#145;Ought I in the public interest to disregard my own personal feelings and stay on the bench?&#146;, and had concluded that &#145;there is no sufficient reason&#146;  (letter of 1 August 1970).<br>
<br>Within the legal profession Fisher's resignation caused emotions ranging from shock and surprise to indignation and hostility. A critical article in the <span class="italic">Solicitors Law Journal</span> deplored the precedent Fisher's move created and concluded that &#145;It should not be too much for the country to ask that, in return for the invaluable constitutional guarantee of security in their appointments, High Court judges should themselves refrain from resigning to take other jobs unless circumstances are exceptional&#146;  (&#145;Current topics&#146;, <span class="italic">Solicitors Law Journal</span>, 114/32, 7 Aug 1970, 593). By contrast the <span class="italic">New Law Journal</span> reacted with calm and restraint, observing that &#145;A judge is entitled like anyone else, to make his life where he honestly believes he can best be himself&#146;  (&#145;On retiring from the High Court bench&#146;, <span class="italic">New Law Journal</span>, 120, 13 Aug 1970, 746&#150;7). The controversy took some time to die down, however. As late as 19 November 1970 Viscount Dilhorne, a former lord chancellor, took the opportunity of a debate on the <span class="roman">Courts Bill</span> to criticize as &#145;inexcusable&#146; the action of any judge who resigned in order to take up a career in business: &#145;having embarked on a judicial career, one is under a moral obligation to do the job and not to give it up in favour of one that appears more attractive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 312.1288, 19 Nov 1970).<br>
<br>Fisher remained with Schroders for five years, also serving on the board of Schroder International and other companies, including Thomas Tilling and Equity and Law Life Assurance. Later in his career he returned to the City as chairman of the appeal committee of the Takeover Panel (1981&#150;7). He was also involved in self-regulation in the City in his capacity as founder chairman of the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation.<h2>
<a name="Publicinquiries"></a>Public inquiries</h2>Notwithstanding the disfavour with which Fisher continued to be regarded by much of the legal establishment after he left the bench, the government was quick to appreciate that there was now available an individual of exceptional skills who could be called upon to undertake the role of chairman in difficult inquiries. The first such appointment came the year after Fisher ceased to be a judge. In March 1971 he was asked by the ministers for social services and for employment and productivity to head a committee to investigate and report on abuse of social security benefits. By October 1972 the committee had produced a painstaking report that included eighty-eight recommendations aimed at minimizing the number of benefit frauds. Although, as with any committee report, it is difficult to spot the fingerprints of any particular member, a couple of the recommendations may be noted as exemplifying Fisher's approach in public affairs. The committee recommended that the departments should not be inhibited in their efforts to detect those working while drawing benefits &#145;by fear of criticism for excessive zeal&#146;, but that the departments &#145;should not take any positive steps to encourage the general public to inform&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 14 April 2005). The first recommendation advocated right conduct by public officials notwithstanding the risk of criticism; the second abhorred the creation of a Stasi-like informer society.<br>
<br>In the Confait inquiry (1975&#150;7) Fisher was asked by the crown to examine a gravely flawed prosecution that had resulted in the conviction of three young men, all for arson, one for murder, and another for manslaughter. On a reference by the home secretary the Court of Appeal, presided over by Lord Scarman, had quashed all the convictions. In the ensuing investigation Fisher heard evidence from numerous witnesses and scrutinized a mass of documents. He concluded that there had been blatant disregard by the police of the &#145;judges' rules&#146; (designed to secure fair procedures for the interrogation of suspects). His cogent report recommended radical changes in the system. This led directly to the appointment of a royal commission under Sir Cyril Philips and thence to the enactment of the <span class="roman">Police and Criminal Evidence Act</span> 1984 and the <span class="roman">Prosecution of Offences Act</span> 1985. The following year the Crown Prosecution Service was established. Fisher's report laid the groundwork for all these reforms. However, it did not satisfy all who read it. Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, who had represented the three young men at the Fisher inquiry, commented after his death that Fisher should have held on the facts that there had been no sustainable case against any of the accused.<br>
<br>In 1979 Fisher was asked by Lloyd's of London to conduct an inquiry into self-regulation at the institution. The following year he produced a seminal report recommending the adoption of a new constitution he had drafted. One aspect of this was the creation of a new governing council. Effective disciplinary machinery was also put in place. A novel feature was a clause protecting council members from claims of negligence; liability was made to depend on bad faith. However, the recommendation to which the greatest financial consequences attached was one to the effect that all Lloyd's brokers should over a five-year period divest themselves of their underwriting interests, on the ground that there was an inherent conflict of interest between the two roles. When Lloyd's presented a private bill to parliament to implement what Fisher had proposed this particular recommendation was omitted. But the House of Commons insisted on its inclusion and the necessary amendments were made before the bill was enacted.<h2>
<a name="WolfsonImperialandretirement"></a>Wolfson, Imperial, and retirement</h2>In 1975 a new opportunity for service had presented itself. On the retirement of Sir Isaiah Berlin, the first president of Wolfson College, Oxford (a college for graduate students, many of them from overseas and many married), Fisher was elected as his successor. This proved to be a brilliant appointment. The Fishers got to know all the students by name and what each was studying. It was a point of pride with Fisher to acquire sufficient knowledge of such subjects as mathematics and physics that he was able to discuss the research projects being undertaken by all members of the college. An exceptional degree of pastoral care was displayed by the Fishers to these students and their families. No visitor to the college could fail to be struck by the warmth of these relationships.<br>
<br>Fisher also had a lifelong interest in scientific developments. It was very appropriate that Lord Sherfield should in 1973 have introduced him to Imperial College as a member of the governing body. From 1975 to 1988 he was its much-respected chairman. Another role he undertook was the presidency of the Howard League for Penal Reform (in succession to Lord Gardiner) from 1983 to 1991. He was a successful fund-raiser on behalf of the league and a gracious host at its annual September conference in Oxford.<br>
<br>Fisher was one of the most brilliant lawyers to appear in the generation after the Second World War. His time on the bench was short, but his career also straddled the City, public service, and the world of academe in a manner for which it would be hard to find a parallel. Such leisure as his restless spirit allowed him was spent with his wife, Felicity, and children and friends, or at the keyboard. His passion was J. S. Bach, whose works he performed with great ability and affection. The music of the romantic composers generally received a cool reception.<br>
<br>For the last few years of his life Fisher lived quietly in retirement at Marlborough, Wiltshire, where he had been a member of the governing council of the school for many years. He walked on the downs, read, listened to and played music, and with his wife travelled abroad. She supported him with the help of the children during his last painful illness. He died at his home in Marlborough on 10 April 2005, following a stroke, and was survived by his wife and children.<br>
