<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McLaren,  (William) Norman</span>  (1914&#150;1987), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born on 11 April 1914 at 21 Albert Place, Stirling, the youngest of three children of William McLaren, a master house painter, and his wife, Jeanie Cross Wilson Smith. Little is known about his early life and education. He studied art and interior design at the Glasgow School of Art (1933&#150;6), but soon found his enthusiasm fired more by college film society screenings of work by Soviet directors V. Pudovkin and S. Eisenstein. He saw film as an exciting new artistic medium and the abstract films of the European avant-garde appealed to his interest in synaesthesia: even as a schoolboy some of his paintings had aspired to represent music visually. Like many artists he realized film was a way to make created images move. His student films, such as the delightful experimental documentary of a student ball, <span class="italic">Camera Makes Whoopee</span> (1935), aroused attention, local newspapers proclaiming him &#145;the young genius of Glasgow School of Art&#146;  (Cutler). He also became, briefly, politicized, making <span class="italic">Hell Unlimited</span> (1936) an anti-capitalist, anti-war film with Scottish sculptor Helen Biggar, and he worked as cameraman on a Spanish civil-war documentary.<br>
<br>John Grierson, a seminal figure in British documentary film-making, and then head of the General Post Office film unit, spotted the young McLaren's talent at a Scottish Amateur Film Festival, and in 1937 he invited his fellow countryman to join him in London. Also at the unit&#151;then a focus for innovative film-making&#151;was Len Lye. Lye's work was a direct precursor to McLaren's own experiments in painting directly onto film, and he rekindled McLaren's interest in animation. He also experimented with drawing sound directly on film. McLaren later wrote that<blockquote>animation is not the art of moving drawings, but of the drawn movement: the key is not what one finds in a drawing, but what is created between the drawings linked in a series. (Solomon, 11)</blockquote>After working on sponsored documentary films, in 1939 McLaren moved to the United States. On arrival in New York he obtained work through friends, painting murals in luxury private homes. He then made some short abstract films with support from the Guggenheim Foundation. In 1941 he was again given a job by Grierson, who was now in Canada heading the new national film board (NFB), a government initiative to help the Canadian war effort. McLaren made propaganda films, experimental in form but with general appeal. In 1943 McLaren was asked to organize an animation department at the NFB in Ottawa. After the war the NFB's remit changed and they made history, ethnic, creative, and experimental films. McLaren had found a perfect haven, allowing him almost total freedom and security to pursue his own artistic goals.<br>
<br>For the next forty years Norman McLaren never ceased to experiment and to invent new techniques. He is most usually associated with the direct, or cameraless, method, which involved working directly onto the film stock, and for his many developments of that technique. But his interests were wide-ranging and this is reflected in the variety of his films, all of which aspired to achieve coherence of the visual rhythm with the rhythm of sound. Like a latter-day Leonardo, he considered science, art, technique, and style as one whole. He often developed techniques before finding a suitable film subject for them. Sometimes his experiments left him dissatisfied, but he would return to them years, even decades, later to successful effect. Process was important to him: he took from the surrealists a belief in the creative role of the unconscious. McLaren's closest collaborator at the NFB until the 1970s was Evelyn Lambart, who had a background in mathematics and science. Together they made <span class="italic">Begone Dull Care</span> (1949), an exuberant abstract film that was accompanied by a jazz score by Oscar Peterson. It enthused Pablo Picasso, who commented, &#145;Finally, something new!&#146;  (Bendazzi, 116), and their vibrancy and appeal have endured.<br>
<br>In 1949 McLaren went to China on a UNESCO mission to teach local artists visual communication for health education programmes. He was caught up in the civil war there and on his return to Canada he made <span class="italic">Neighbours</span> (1952). This pixilated allegory of how humankind's territorial instincts lead to mutual destruction won an Oscar in 1953. McLaren's reply to a congratulatory telegram was typical: &#145;Thanks, but who is Oscar?&#146; His stay in India that year, working on another government education project, saw the structure of his own films become influenced by Indian classical music&#151;gradually developing a simple theme and increasing in complexity and tempo.<br>
<br>The late 1950s and early 1960s saw McLaren return to experiments with abstraction, particularly with geometric forms. A growing interest in how film could represent dance was manifest in the later 1960s. <span class="italic">Pas de deux</span> (1967) began with a desire to see images multiply in a stroboscopic way and it revived E. J. Marey's technique of chronophotography to recreate the movement of two dancers; it was the first of a series of dance films.<br>
<br>McLaren was an intensely private man, and when he was asked to introduce the 1960 Montreal film festival, shyness led him to animate himself on film instead&#151;also a demonstration of his sense of fun. He was generous with his knowledge and he duplicated technical notes on all of his films in response to enquiries from around the world about his methods. Some critics have questioned McLaren's status as an abstract artist, given the tendency to figuration and narrative suggestion in many of his films, but for others that tendency is precisely their appeal. The dance series often divided opinion. It is perhaps the earlier films that continue to have the strongest impact, but the body of his work as a whole is rich enough to sustain enduring interest. Although he retired in 1984 McLaren continued to experiment with film-making. He died, unmarried, in Montreal on 26 January 1987.<br>
