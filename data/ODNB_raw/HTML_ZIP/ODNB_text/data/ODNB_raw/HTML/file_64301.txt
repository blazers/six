<span class="headword">Ruddiman,  Walter</span>  (1719&#150;1781), <span class="occ">printer and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born in the parish of Alvah, by Banff on the Moray Firth, the youngest of the four sons of James Ruddiman (<i>c</i>.1680&#150;<i>c</i>.1739), farmer, and his wife, Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ruddiman. The will of his brother John (<i>d</i>. 1744), proved in Aberdeen on 11 March 1745, reveals Walter to have been then employed as a &#145;merchant in Banff&#146;  (cited in Johnston, <span class="italic">Ruddimans in Scotland</span>). It was shortly after this date that he moved to Edinburgh to work as a printer. That move meant that there were then two firms named Ruddiman working as printers in Edinburgh: that of Walter and the established firm of his uncles <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24249/', "Thomas Ruddiman (1674&#150;1757)")</script> and Walter (1687&#150;1770). Until the death of the elder Walter, he appears as &#145;Walter Ruddiman Junior&#146; on the title-pages of his publications. On 11 September 1754 he was admitted a burgess of Edinburgh, and about that time he married Janet Bradfute (<i>d</i>. 1776), with whom he had four children: Thomas (1755&#150;1825), with whom he entered partnership and who inherited his printing firm; John (<i>d</i>. 1816); Walter (1762&#150;1823), a lieutenant in the Scots brigade in the Netherlands; and Janet (1761&#150;1849).<br>
<br>In July 1757 Ruddiman began publishing the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>, a periodical in octavo bearing the imprint &#145;Edinburgh:/Printed by Walter Ruddiman Junior and Company,/Morocco's Close, Lawn - Market&#146;. Ruddiman abandoned the project in 1762, after publishing the sixth volume. His most significant undertaking was to publish the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine, or, Edinburgh Amusement</span>. The first issue was published on 7 July 1768, and the periodical claimed to offer &#145;The Essence of all the Magazines, Reviews, Newspapers, &amp;c. published in Great Britain: Also Extracts from every new Work of Merit, whether political, literary, serious, or comical, being a Register of the Writings and Transactions of the Times&#146;. It was a tremendous success, quickly establishing itself as the most popular weekly publication in Edinburgh, selling as many as 3000 copies per week. By 1770 Ruddiman had moved his business to Forrester's Wynd in Edinburgh's Lawnmarket, and from that location came the edition of the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine</span> (7 February 1771) that carried the first published poem of Robert Fergusson (1750&#150;1774). Ruddiman's son Thomas became a partner in the following April, and it is with the imprint &#145;Printed by Walter and Thomas Ruddiman&#146; that the first edition of <span class="italic">Poems by Robert Fergusson</span> appeared in January 1773, the only edition to appear in the poet's lifetime. In his versified will Fergusson bequeathed his portrait to Ruddiman, concluding with the request that his will be printed:<blockquote>
<div>patent may it be, and seen,<br>
</div>
<div>in Walter's <span class="roman">Weekly Magazine</span>.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>By the mid-1770s the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine</span> was a runaway success, not least because of its appealing mix of reviews, literature, and news. Newspapers carried stamp duty at the time; &#145;literary&#146; periodicals did not. The presence of news in the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine</span> was brought to the attention of the exchequer, which found it liable to stamp duty on this account. In response Ruddiman in 1777 divided the magazine into two separate publications: a new octavo newspaper entitled <span class="italic">Ruddiman's Weekly Mercury</span>, costing 3<i>d</i>. and attracting tax at a halfpenny per copy, and the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine</span>, now a weekly miscellany free of news and tax, which from the forty-seventh volume (30 December 1779) became the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine, or, Literary Amusement</span>. Ruddiman's restructuring of his publications effectively divided his market: in 1780 the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span> had a circulation of some 1400 copies, the <span class="italic">Weekly Mercury</span> between 1800 and 2000. The action brought against Ruddiman, together with his response, had an important influence in clarifying the distinction between newspapers and other periodical forms that is common today. Predeceased by his wife, who had died on 21 May 1776, Walter Ruddiman died in Edinburgh on 16 June 1781, and was buried on 19 June at the city's Greyfriars churchyard.<br>
