<span class="headword">Lehmann <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Bedford]</span>,  Elizabeth Nina Mary Frederica <span class="st"> [Liza]</span></span>  (1862&#150;1918), <span class="occ">composer and singer</span>, was born on 11 July 1862 at 139 Westbourne Terrace, London, the daughter of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34481/', "(Wilhelm Augustus) Rudolf Lehmann (1819&#150;1905)")</script> and his wife, the composer Amelia Lehmann (&#145;A. L.&#146;), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chambers (1820&#150;1903). Always known as Liza, she spent the first five years of her life in Italy before her parents returned to England and settled in London. Apart from a year spent at a day school she was privately educated, and her first music teacher was her mother. She also studied singing with Alberto Randegger and Jenny Lind and composition with Niels Ravnkilde and Wilhelm Freudenberg. Encouraged by both her parents to embark on a career as a professional musician, Lehmann made her formal d&eacute;but as a lyric soprano at a Monday Popular Concert in London in 1885 at the age of twenty-three. Over the next nine years she was in great demand as a concert singer, and she performed at both private and public venues throughout Britain. Her repertory included both her own songs, which started appearing in print in 1888, and various seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English songs which she discovered in the British Museum.<br>
<br>On 10 October 1894 Lehmann married the amateur composer Herbert Bedford (1867&#150;1945), son of John Thomas Bedford, and retired from the public stage. She turned instead to composition, and in 1896 she wrote her best-known work, the song cycle <span class="italic">In a Persian Garden</span>, for four voices and piano. Lehmann saw this as her &#145;first serious composition&#146;  (Lehmann, 70), and one critic described it as &#145;one of the most impressive works ever penned by a female composer&#146;  (<span class="italic">MT</span>, 38, 1897, 20). A setting of a selection of verses from &#145;Umar Khayyam's <span class="italic">Rubaiyat</span> in the translation by Edward FitzGerald, <span class="italic">In a Persian Garden</span> captured the <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> fascination with the Orient and philosophy of living for the moment. It is still sometimes performed today, and at the end of the twentieth century was widely heard throughout Britain and the United States.<br>
<br>The song cycle was not commonly used by British composers in the late nineteenth century, and Lehmann can be credited with establishing the genre in Britain. Further cycles included the intense and moving <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> (1899), for baritone or mezzo-soprano and piano, to sections from Tennyson's poem of the same name. The births of her two sons, Rudolf (<i>b</i>. 1897) and Leslie (1900&#150;1989), inspired several works either written for children or reflecting childhood. Among these were the much-loved cycles <span class="italic">The Daisy-Chain</span> (1900), for four voices and piano, to poems by Robert Louis Stevenson and others, and its sequel <span class="italic">More Daisies</span> (1902). Humour also became an important element of Lehmann's work, as in the cycles <span class="italic">Nonsense Songs</span>, incorporating &#145;The Songs that Came out Wrong from Alice in Wonderland (Lewis Carroll)&#146; (1908), for four voices and piano, and <span class="italic">Four Cautionary Tales and a Moral</span> (1909), to poems by Hilaire Belloc, for two voices and piano. Always well crafted and using compelling melodies, such light-hearted works were in great demand from both the public and Lehmann's publishers. In addition they provided a vital source of income when Bedford fell into financial difficulties. Lehmann found it harder to gain a hearing for what she described as her &#145;more ambitious work&#146;  (Lehmann, 117) and, as her more popular music became widely known, faced growing disapproval from critics previously enthusiastic.<br>
<br>In 1904 Lehmann was the first woman to be commissioned to compose the music for a musical comedy. <span class="italic">Sergeant Brue</span>, with a libretto by Owen Hall and lyrics by J. Hickory Wood, was an undoubted success, playing in London for 290 performances between 1904 and 1905. Other stage works were the light opera <span class="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</span> (1906), to a libretto by Laurence Housman after Oliver Goldsmith, and an operatic version of the morality play <span class="italic">Everyman</span> (1915).<br>
<br>While cultivating an acceptably ladylike image as devoted mother and wife (clearly reflected in her published memoirs <span class="italic">The Life of Liza Lehmann</span>, which appeared posthumously in 1919), Lehmann always remained fiercely professional. Towards the end of her life she toured the United States, took up a post at the Guildhall School of Music, and served as the first president of the Society of Women Musicians (established in 1911). In 1916 she was devastated by the death of her beloved son Rudolph during military training and could not continue with many of these activities. She died at her home at Hatch End, Pinner, on 19 September 1918.<br>
