<span class="headword">Shuttleworth,  Robert James</span>  (1810&#150;1874), <span class="occ">botanist and conchologist</span>, was born at Dawlish, Devon, in February 1810, the eldest son of James Shuttleworth (<i>d</i>. 1846) of Barton Lodge, Preston, Lancashire, and his first wife, Anna Maria, daughter of the Hon. and Revd Richard Henry Roper, dean of Clones. His mother died of consumption a few weeks after his birth; his father married again in 1815 and settled in Switzerland. Shuttleworth was chiefly brought up by his mother's relatives. He was sent to school at Geneva, studying under Seringe, keeper of the Candolle Herbarium, and botanizing on the mountains near Geneva. At the age of eighteen he went to Germany, passing a winter at Saxe-Weimar where he enjoyed the court life and came to know Goethe. He also spent some time at Frankfurt and Heidelberg before being recalled to his father's house at Soleure (apparently his father feared his becoming too irresponsible and boisterous if left to his own devices).<br>
<br>Retaining his interest in botany, Shuttleworth made a considerable collection in the Jura during the summer of 1830. From the autumn of that year until the end of 1832 he studied in the medical faculty of the University of Edinburgh. During this period he also made a vacation tour in the highlands, and helped his stepbrother Blake on his estate in the west of Ireland during the famine of 1831 and 1832. On 11 January 1833 Shuttleworth was appointed to a captaincy in the duke of Lancaster's own regiment, but after returning to Soleure in the following winter he married Susette, daughter of Comte de Sury of Soleure, and settled at Bern. The couple later had a son, Henry, and a daughter who died in childhood.<br>
<br>In Switzerland, Shuttleworth resumed his botanizing. He collected on the Grimsel and the Oberland, and worked particularly on red snow (<i>Chlamydomonas</i>) and other freshwater algae, until weak eyesight compelled him to abandon the microscope. In 1835 he purchased the extensive herbarium and library of Joseph August Schultes of Z&uuml;rich. Between 1840 and 1850 he became interested in conchology, an interest sparked by a friendship with Jean de Charpentier of Bex, himself a zealous conchologist.<br>
<br>Shuttleworth spent money freely on his researches. He sent the collector Blauner of Bern to Corsica, the Canaries, and ultimately to Puerto Rico (where he died of consumption). Other collectors in the Americas were also supported through Shuttleworth's purchase of their shells, plants, and seeds. He worked up a large number of the plants, forming a very extensive annotated herbarium.<br>
<br>Shuttleworth suffered from gout, a condition which led him to winter in the south, where he botanized in the Var and Alpes-Maritimes. This resulted in a <span class="italic">Catalogue des plantes de Provence</span> (1889). Indeed, many of his botanical discoveries were in part due to his constant comparison of French with Italian types. His letters and the notes in his herbarium also evince the critical caution which made him apt to recognize minute differences. However, following the death in 1866 of his son, Henry, then a medical student, Shuttleworth moved to Hy&egrave;res, and gave up scientific work.<br>
<br>Shuttleworth joined the Botanical Society of Edinburgh as an original member in 1836, became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1856, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Basel. Following his death, at Hy&egrave;res on 19 April 1874, Shuttleworth's collection of shells, considered by Mousson  (<span class="italic">Journal de Conchyliologie</span>, 23.99) one of the most remarkable in Europe, was presented to the state museum at Bern. His herbarium of more than 150,000 specimens of flowering plants and 20,000 cryptogams was added to the British Museum collection. An account of the various collections comprised in this herbarium appears in the official report of the department of botany in the museum for 1877  (<span class="italic">Journal of Botany, British and Foreign</span>, 2nd ser., 7, 1878, 179&#150;80).<br>
<br>Shuttleworth was the author of some twenty papers, including several on the land and freshwater shells of Corsica. He also published <span class="italic">Nouvelles observations sur la mati&egrave;re coloriante de la neige rouge</span> (1840), and <span class="italic">Notitiae malacologicae</span> (1856). <span class="italic">Notitiae</span> contained nine lithographic plates, of which eight were unsigned, and presumably by Shuttleworth. The second part of <span class="italic">Notitiae</span> was issued in 1878, edited with synonymy by Dr Paul Fischer and containing a &#145;Nekrolog von R. J. Shuttleworth&#146;, by Guthnick, director of the Bern Botanical Garden.<br>
