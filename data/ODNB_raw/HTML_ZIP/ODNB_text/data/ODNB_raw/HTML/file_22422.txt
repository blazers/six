<span class="headword">Pocock,  Isaac Innes</span>  (1782&#150;1835), <span class="occ">playwright and painter</span>, was born at Bristol on 2 March 1782. He was the second and eldest surviving son of the sea captain turned marine painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22425/', "Nicholas Pocock (1740&#150;1821)")</script> and his wife, Ann Evans (1752&#150;1827), and, after the family moved to London in 1789, was educated by Joseph Hambledon at Hemel Hempstead. He then trained as a painter, first under George Romney from September 1797 to between February 1799 and Romney's return to the north later that year, after which he worked for a while under Sir William Beechey RA. He exhibited historical compositions and portraits at the Royal Academy (1803&#150;18), the British Institution (1806&#150;17), and the Liverpool Academy (1810&#150;14). In 1807 he won the first 100 guinea premium awarded by the British Institution, for his painting <span class="italic">The Insolent Visit of Thomas &agrave; Becket to Henry II</span>, and was a candidate for associate of the Royal Academy in 1806 and 1811. Pocock married Louisa Hime, a &#145;Jewish proselyte&#146; (W. I. Pocock's phrase), at St Nicholas's parish church, Liverpool, on 29 August 1812, and they had three daughters and a son: Anne (<i>b</i>. 13 July 1813), Louisa (<i>b</i>. 28 May 1815), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22423/', "Isaac John Innes Pocock (1819&#150;1886)")</script>, and Frances Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 29 June 1824).<br>
<br>Pocock's last known painting was an altarpiece for the former chapel of St Andrew and St Mary Magdalene at Maidenhead, Berkshire, a gift from him in 1825, complementing the organ presented by his widowed aunt Anne, Lady Pocock, in 1817. On her death in 1818 he ceased exhibiting and inherited Ray Lodge, the Maidenhead property of his uncle Sir Isaac Pocock (1751&#150;1810), who, like his elder brother Nicholas, had been a Bristol sea captain and was knighted as high sheriff of Northampton in 1786.<br>
<br>Isaac Pocock shortly afterwards became an active local magistrate and, in 1831, a deputy lieutenant of Berkshire, devoting his time to local affairs and the playwriting on which his memory largely rests. His first dramatic piece, the musical farce <span class="italic">Yes and No</span>, was produced at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, in 1808; having some musical ability, he easily collaborated in many similar works for the three London theatres royal, though the most successful were published and more widely performed. In 1813 his <span class="italic">Miller and his Men</span>, an archetype of spectacular melodrama and the most popular staple of the nineteenth-century toy theatre, with villainous miller, brigand crew, innocent heroine, and explosive finale, was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. The music was by Henry Bishop, their next well-known collaboration being <span class="italic">Home Sweet Home, or, The ranz des vaches</span>, of which the Bishop&#150;Pocock master is in the British Library. Pocock's first adaptation from the works of Sir Walter Scott, the operatic drama <span class="italic">Rob Roy Macgregor, or, Auld Lang Syne</span>, was performed at Covent Garden in March 1818&#151;&#145;a well-made little patchwork with plenty of highland songs and thoroughly pasteboard characters&#146;  (Downer, 56). It was none the less Macready's first important role as hero and when performed at Edinburgh was honoured by the presence of Scott himself. Several other such adaptations followed, but none so successful, and Pocock not only wrote but on occasion also supplied watercolour drawings of his ideas for scenery and costume. Setting sketches for his Christmas equestrian spectacle <span class="italic">King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table</span>, adapted from Scott's poem &#145;The Bridal of Triermain&#146; and performed at Drury Lane in December 1834, and costume drawings for his posthumously produced <span class="italic">Cavaliers and Roundheads</span>, adapted from Scott's <span class="italic">Old Mortality</span> and performed at Drury Lane in October 1835, are in the Theatre Museum, London. A single setting sketch for the latter is in the British Museum among designs by the Grieve family, who actually executed the scenery.<br>
<br>Pocock's merit as a playwright, in common with similar contemporaries', was his ability to turn out a stream of stageworthy and commercial, but otherwise ephemeral, pieces for a popular audience. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> lists thirty-one which were performed, but there were others: Nicoll's tally of forty-eight comprises twenty-six melodramas or musical dramas, nine farces, four operatic farces, and nine other works (four classed an interlude, a ballet, a comic opera, and an entertainment, and five unspecified). Pocock was addressed in verse as &#145;Ingenious son of an ingenious Sire&#146; by William Hayley, whose son Thomas Alphonso was a fellow pupil of Romney, who made a sketch of them together in February 1799 while all were at the Hayleys at Eartham, Sussex. As master of Ray Lodge, Pocock was noted for his kindness and generosity; a few surviving letters (transcripts in the Theatre Museum) show tory attitudes and sociable habits, and throw a little light on theatre in Berkshire at the time of his death. He died from a sudden collapse brought on by gallstones at his home on 25 August 1835, and he was buried in the vault of Holy Trinity, Cookham, where his is one of several family memorials (his uncle Sir Isaac's being by John Flaxman).<br>
<br>Pocock's portrait of George Bartley as Hamlet is in the Garrick Club, London, and one of C. E. Horn as Seraskier in James Cobb's and Stephen Storace's comic opera <span class="italic">The Siege of Belgrade</span> (exh. RA, 1817) is in the collection of the Royal Society of Musicians, London. One of his father (exh. RA, 1811), which was engraved by Edward Scriven (impression and plate, NMM), is in the possession of a distant relative, together with one of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22429/', "William Innes Pocock (1783&#150;1836)")</script>, a naval lieutenant who was also an accomplished marine watercolourist, which is also possibly by Isaac Pocock. Some engravings from his other portraits are in the British Museum, while his composition <span class="italic">Britannia Recommending to the Historic Muse the Victors of the Present War</span> is the frontispiece to the July 1799 issue of the <span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, a journal for which his father did much work. According to his brother William, while still living in London Pocock was elected to serve as lieutenant, captain, and major in the light company of the Westminster voluntary (the Royal Westminster volunteers, according to Isaac's obituary, <span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 4, 1835, 657&#150;8), and there is an oil portrait by Beechey in the Indianapolis Museum of Art which may show Pocock as a young man in militia uniform, though this identification remains tentative. The National Portrait Gallery archives hold a record of a now unlocated head-and-shoulders version of this portrait.<br>
