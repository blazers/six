<span class="headword">Tuckwell,  William</span>  (1829&#150;1919), <span class="occ">schoolmaster, author, and self-styled radical parson</span>, was born in Oxford on 27 November 1829, the eldest son of William Tuckwell (1784&#150;1845), and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood (1803/4&#150;1842). His father was a surgeon at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford and was the leading practitioner in the city. Tuckwell attended a preparatory school in Hammersmith before entering Winchester College as a scholar in 1842. He had a notably successful school career; becoming prefect of hall in 1847 and winning both the queen's silver medal for oratory and the gold medal for English composition a year later. He proceeded to New College, Oxford, in 1848. In retrospect Tuckwell realized this was a mistake. &#145;At that time&#146;, he recalled, &#145;New College absorbed the cream of Winchester and converted it into the thinnest milk&#146;  (Tuckwell, &#145;Corpuscular reminiscences&#146;, 78). Sure enough, he graduated in 1852 with a disappointing fourth in <i>literae humaniores</i>. None the less, New College was to be consistently important throughout his life. He held his fellowship there until 1858, and even afterwards was to rely repeatedly on its patronage.<br>
<br>Between 1853 and 1854 Tuckwell worked as a master at St Columba's College, Rathfarnham, near Dublin. He was then ordained, and served as curate of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford. From 1857 to 1864 he was headmaster of New College School. This was not a particularly challenging role. The school was small and undistinguished. It did, however, allow him time to develop his interest in educational reform and to act as chaplain and precentor to the college between 1858 and 1862. Still more importantly, in 1858 it enabled him to marry Rosa (<i>b</i>. 1829/30), eldest daughter of Captain Henry Strong, an Indian army officer; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32825/', "Emilia Frances Dilke")</script> was her younger sister. Rosa and William Tuckwell had four children, one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1864 Tuckwell moved to Taunton, having been appointed to the headmastership of the grammar school there by New College. With the support of Lord Taunton he transformed the place: increasing numbers from 22 on his arrival to 120 eleven years later, erecting new buildings, and&#151;most significantly&#151;reforming the curriculum. The Taunton Collegiate School, as Tuckwell reconstituted it, pioneered the teaching of science; a fact which he publicized in papers to the British Association, in articles for <span class="italic">Nature</span>, and in his evidence to the schools inquiry commission. Nor were his innovations limited to science. His boys were also taught geography and history, French and German, and even English language and literature. By 1877, however, it was clear that Taunton was in trouble. Tuckwell's modern curriculum and his decision to admit Catholics and nonconformists as well as Anglicans to the school had not proved sufficiently popular to be profitable. Despite a staunch defence of his work by <span class="italic">Nature</span>, Tuckwell resigned as headmaster, apparently condemned to life as a housemaster at Blundell's School, Tiverton.<br>
<br>Once again New College came to the rescue, appointing him to the living of Stockton, Warwickshire, in 1878. It was here that he became a public figure. Influenced by writers like Henry George and Alfred Russel Wallace, and shocked by the poverty of his parish, Tuckwell set about a programme of practical reform. He established a school board, lectured on English history and geology, founded a choir, and&#151;in 1886&#151;divided his glebe land into allotments for the villagers. Increasingly he was drawn into party politics as well. An invitation in 1884 to address the local Liberal Association started a decade-long campaign of public speaking, which took him through Warwickshire and Wales, and to annual meetings of the National Liberal Federation. At the general election of 1885 he urged the newly enfranchised agricultural labourers to support the Liberals. He wrote voluminously too, advocating land nationalization, the disendowment and disestablishment of the Church of England, universal suffrage, home rule, and a broad swathe of reforms which he characterized as Christian socialism.<br>
<br>In 1893 Tuckwell left Stockton to take on the living of Waltham in Lincolnshire. The move brought with it a withdrawal from party politics. He turned to writing memoirs and studies of more literary themes. 1893 saw the publication of his <span class="italic">Ancient Ways: Winchester Fifty Years Ago</span>. This was followed by <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Oxford</span> (1900), <span class="italic">Reminiscences of a Radical Parson</span> (1905), and <span class="italic">Pre-Tractarian Oxford</span> (1909). Discursive and diverting in equal measure, these proved to be a huge hit with the reading public. Tuckwell had always enjoyed teaching English; indeed he had been a candidate for the Merton chair of English at Oxford in 1885. He now wrote popular accounts of Spencer (1900), Kinglake (1902), Chaucer (1904), and Horace (1905), and produced a scholarly edition of Milton's <span class="italic">Lycidas</span> in 1911. Tuckwell retired as rector of Waltham in 1905, and moved to live with his brother-in-law, Sir Charles Dilke, at Pyrford Rough, Pyrford, Surrey. He died there on 1 February 1919.<br>
<br>William Tuckwell saw himself as the natural inheritor of the broad church tradition within Anglicanism. A belief in the power of education and in the need for a truly national church informed his whole career. Tuckwell's personal philosophy, however, was deeply idiosyncratic: rooted both in incarnationalism and in the idea of the Norman yoke; drawing equally on the ameliorism of Henry George and the arcadianism of William Morris. He was a radical Liberal, yet he never lost his nostalgia for unreformed Oxford. Ultimately Tuckwell's politics limited his prospects. A contemporary concluded that he was &#145;magnificent; but he'll never be a bishop&#146;  (Tuckwell, <span class="italic">Radical Parson</span>, 208). His ideals were perpetuated by his daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36572/', "Gertrude Tuckwell")</script>. It was to her that he dedicated the <span class="italic">Reminiscences of a Radical Parson</span> and she who acted as executor after his death.<br>
