<span class="headword">McGregor, Sir  Ian Alexander</span>  (1922&#150;2007), <span class="occ">malariologist</span>, was born on 26 August 1922 at 12 Church Street, Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, the son of John McGregor (<i>d</i>. 1945), tailor, and his wife, Isabella Chapman Greig, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1974). He had two older half-brothers, his mother's first husband having died in an industrial accident. He was educated at Rutherglen Academy, Lanarkshire. Uncertain as to whether to pursue a career in medicine or veterinary medicine, he was too late to gain a place in medicine at the University of Glasgow. He elected instead to study at the extramural St Mungo College and Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and graduated in 1945, having secured the class medals in anatomy, physiology, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, and public health, with certificates of merit in seven other subjects, a record McGregor himself described simply as &#145;good&#146;  (autobiographical notes).<br>
<br>McGregor was conscripted into the army in 1946. Before the end of the year he was posted to a field ambulance at Suez, by the side of the canal, relocating after only a few weeks to al-Sarafand in Palestine. He was ordered to train as a malariologist at the Middle East School of Hygiene at Dimra, near Gaza, and then assumed the post of command malariologist, spending his time travelling through Palestine and Transjordan inspecting the seven malaria control units that were in his charge and organizing training courses for other regimental medical officers.<br>
<br>Having completed his military service in 1948, McGregor enrolled to study for the diploma in tropical medicine and hygiene at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and in 1949 was persuaded by Benjamin Stanley Platt, professor of human nutrition at the school, to join the Medical Research Council (MRC)'s human nutrition research unit that had been established in the Gambia. He was asked to investigate the possible contributory role of parasitic infections on protein malnutrition and began by assessing the incidence of splenic enlargement and anaemia in children under ten years of age in the village of Keneba, in the remote Kiang West district. It was during this period of relative isolation in Keneba that his lifelong interest in acquired malarial immunity and the mechanisms responsible for it developed. He had observed a reduction in the incidence of malaria in residents of Keneba as a result of the use of insecticide and periodic drug treatment but even when used in combination these interventions failed to eliminate the disease. Repeated serious episodes of malaria in young children stood in stark contrast to the infrequent cases in adults, leading McGregor to question the view that immunity to malaria was ineffective.<br>
<br>McGregor published the results of his preliminary but detailed observations in 1952, as &#145;A nutritional assessment of the results of the control of parasitic diseases in Keneba, a rural Gambian village&#146; in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</span>. This led to the MRC's invitation to him to develop his research on diseases that were important in the Gambia, as director of the Gambian unit, later termed the MRC Laboratories, in 1954. Meanwhile, on 30 January that year, at Mapledurham, Oxfordshire, he married (Nancy) Joan Small (<i>b</i>. 1922), an executive officer in the MRC, and daughter of Frederick Herbert Small, company director. They had two children, Alistair (<i>b</i>. 1956) and Lesley (<i>b</i>. 1957).<br>
<br>As director of the MRC's Gambian unit, McGregor embarked on the seminal field studies of malaria immunity that led to the demonstration that antibodies from adult Gambian serum had the capacity to reduce both the levels of malaria parasites in the blood and the clinical effects of the infection in the recipients who were young Gambian children suffering acute clinical <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> or <i>Plasmodium malariae</i>. This was the first reliable experimental data showing that humans repeatedly exposed to malaria infection could develop an immunity that was capable of restricting clinical illness and the density of parasites in the blood. Since this acquired immunity could be transferred by antibodies from immune serum, vaccination against malaria was at least theoretically possible. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that adult Gambian serum had the same therapeutic effect when used in children from Tanzania who had <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria, suggesting that west and east African strains of the malaria parasite had common features and that a vaccine against parasites from one region of Africa might be effective in protecting against parasites from other regions.<br>
<br>Many other important contributions followed. McGregor's work at the MRC Laboratories, Gambia, on malaria immunology and epidemiology underpinned the global effort to combat malaria. The quest for an effective vaccine, essentially triggered by McGregor's passive transfer of immune serum, continued at his death. His nutritional studies from Keneba provided demographic and health data that was also still being used by researchers at the time of his death.<br>
<br>McGregor served as chair or rapporteur on several important World Health Organization committees on malaria. He gave generously of his time, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of malaria, gleaned from his many years of practical experience in the field, ensured that the epidemiological features of malaria immunity were paramount when decisions on policy and planning of malaria research and control activities were being made by the World Health Organization in Geneva. McGregor was one of the very few scientists who had a complete mastery of malariology, amply demonstrated in his publication, with Walter Wernsdorfer, of <span class="italic">Malaria: Principles and Practice of Malariology</span> in 1988.<br>
<br>McGregor finally left the Gambia in 1980, becoming a professorial fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. He continued to write about malaria and was particularly supportive of younger researchers at the school until he retired in 1994. He received many prizes and other honours. He was appointed OBE in 1959 and CBE in 1968, and knighted in 1982. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1981 and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1987, and was president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene from 1983 to 1985. He died at Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, on 1 February 2007, following a heart attack suffered at home in Homington, Wiltshire, and was survived by his wife, Joan, and their two children.<br>
