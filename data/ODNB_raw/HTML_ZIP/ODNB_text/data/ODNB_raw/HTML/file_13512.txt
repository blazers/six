<span class="headword">Holl family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1800&#150;1884), <span class="occ">printmakers</span>, came to prominence with the engraver <a name="cosubject_13512"></a><span class="headword">William Holl the elder</span>  (1771&#150;1838)<span class="occ"></span>, who was apparently of German origin and a pupil of Benjamin Smith, engraver. William Holl's prints were executed mainly in stipple and included many plates of portraits, decorative subjects, and statuary after contemporary artists, one of his best works being <span class="italic">The Boar which Killed Adonis Brought before Venus</span> after Richard Westall (1802). Although a man of retiring disposition, Holl was an advanced liberal in politics with strongly held views on social equality. At the time of the Spa Fields riots in 1816 he exposed himself and his family to great risk by concealing the ringleader, James Watson, son of the radical James Watson (1766&#150;1836), and helping him escape to America. He was married to Mary Ravenscroft, who was recorded as the mother of his children in 1815. Holl was one of the first engravers to try out the new matrix of the steel plate for engraving banknotes in 1819. He also pioneered the use of stipple-engraving on steel, as seen in his <span class="italic">Portrait of the Reverend John Roadhouse</span> (1821). He died in London on 1 December 1838.<br>
<br>William Holl had four sons who were all apprenticed to their father as engravers. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_13513"></a><span class="headword">William Holl the younger</span>  (1807&#150;1871)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Plaistow, London, in February 1807 and baptized on 6 August 1815 at St Mary's, St Marylebone, Middlesex. His independent plates date from 1835 with a series of portraits for E. Lodge's <span class="italic">Portraits of Illustrious Personages</span> (2nd edn, 1835). He also worked in line-engraving and mezzotint and between 1860 and 1871 he exhibited twenty-two engravings at the Royal Academy. He produced plates for the Art Union of London from 1851 and his plate after W. P. B. Frith's <span class="italic">An Old English Merrymaking</span> (1849), was the first large engraving to be executed in the &#145;chalk&#146; style. William Holl the younger was a founder member of the Chalcographic Society formed by several prominent engravers in 1830. He died at his home, 174 Adelaide Road, Haverstock Hill, London, on 30 January 1871, leaving a widow, Annie. His brother Charles Holl (<i>c</i>.1810&#150;1882) worked in his studio for thirty years and completed several plates after William's death, including <span class="italic">Rebekah</span> after Frederick Goodall (1871) for the Art Union of London. Charles exhibited only one plate under his own name at the Royal Academy, in 1874.<br>
<br>Henry Benjamin Holl (1808&#150;1884) was baptized on 6 August 1815 at St Mary's, St Marylebone, Middlesex. He was also a portrait engraver of merit whose plates date from 1828 to 1861. He was also an actor and a wine merchant and enjoyed a gregarious and cultured life. He was living at Broadstairs, Kent, with his wife and family in 1874 but apparently he died at Marisiana in the United States in 1884.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13510"></a><span class="headword">Francis Holl</span>  (1815&#150;1884)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 23 March 1815 at Bayham Street, Camden Town, London, and baptized on 6 August that year with his brothers and sister, Isabella, at St Mary's, St Marylebone, Middlesex. He became a successful and fashionable engraver, working for book as well as print publishers. He frequently collaborated with his brother William, as in the four plates after J. Hayter for Finden's <span class="italic">Gallery of Beauty</span> (1841). He worked for twenty-five years engraving the queen's pictures and received royal commissions to execute private plates of portraits of the royal family. He engraved many plates after works by famous artists of the day. Two of his most popular engravings were <span class="italic">The Railway Station</span> (1862) and <span class="italic">Coming of Age in the Olden Time</span> (1854), both after paintings by W. P. B. Frith. Between 1856 and 1883 he exhibited twenty engravings at the Royal Academy and was finally elected an associate engraver in 1883. Francis Holl was also well known as an amateur actor and was a member of the Histrionics, who played at St James's Theatre, London. In 1846 and 1848 he played comic characters in performances in aid of the Artists' General Benevolent Fund, given by an amateur company of eminent artists which included George Cruickshank. He also sang well and played the cello. On 23 September 1841 he married Alicia Margaret, the daughter of Robert Dixon, a veteran of Trafalgar, and they had two sons and two daughters. The family lived for many years at 30 Gloucester Road, Regent's Park, London. In 1879 Francis Holl retired to live at Elm House, Milford, Surrey, where he died of peritonitis on 14 January 1884. He was buried on 19 January at Highgate cemetery, Middlesex. His wife survived him. His eldest son, Francis Montague Holl, known as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13511/', "Frank Holl (1845&#150;1888)")</script>, showed artistic talent from an early age. He became a celebrated portrait painter and was elected a Royal Academician in 1883.<br>
