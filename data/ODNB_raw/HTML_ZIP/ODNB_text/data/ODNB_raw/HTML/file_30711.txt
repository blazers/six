</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bennett,  Richard Bedford</span>, Viscount Bennett  (1870&#150;1947), <span class="occ">prime minister of Canada</span>, was born at Hopewell Hill, Albert county, New Brunswick, on 3 July 1870, the eldest of the three sons and two daughters of Henry John Bennett (1842&#150;1905), shipbuilder and later general merchant at Hopewell Cape and his wife, Henrietta Stiles (1844&#150;1914), a schoolteacher, daughter of Captain Daniel Stiles of Hopewell Hill, 8 miles to the west of the cape. His mother was a staunch Wesleyan Methodist, her husband an easy-going, occasionally bibulous, Baptist.<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlylife"></a>Family and early life</h2>Henrietta Stiles's Methodism became the supreme law in the Bennett family, with its strong emphasis on work, diligence, and self-denial. Make sure, John Wesley had said, that you don't waste time with<blockquote>silly unprofitable diversions. You have always something better to do &hellip; Do it as soon as possible. No delay! &hellip; And do it as well as possible. Do not sleep or yawn over it. Put your whole strength to the work. (J. Wesley, &#145;The use of money&#146;, <span class="italic">The Works of John Wesley</span>, ed. A. C. Outler, 1985, 273&#150;9)</blockquote>Then followed Wesley's further rule, &#145;Save all you can&#146;  (ibid.). And curb wilfulness, which is the main source of sin, including smoking, drinking, and dancing. By this abstemious life, having earned and saved all you could, you then gave away as much as you could to society, to the needy, to good causes. These were the lessons that Henrietta taught Richard, her eldest son. Bourgeois to the core, they inculcated a way of life that was austere, sober, hard-working, and socially conservative. If charitable to the outer world, Henrietta's Methodism was exacting to the inner self. Those moral principles would guide R. B. Bennett all his life.<br>
<br>Something else came from Bennett's mother: ambition. Aim high, she said. Young Bennett had to memorize Longfellow's &#145;Ladder of St Augustine&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>The heights by great men reached and kept<br>
</div>
<div>Were not attained by sudden flight,<br>
</div>
<div>But they, while their companions slept,<br>
</div>
<div>Were toiling upward in the night.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Henrietta Bennett's ambition for her eldest son came probably from frustrated hopes for her husband. Henry Bennett's training was in shipbuilding in his father's yard at the cape; by the mid-1870s the shipyards there, and in the maritime provinces of Canada generally, were having a difficult time and Henry Bennett had to turn himself into a general merchant and farmer. He was not very successful at either. R. B. Bennett's penury started early in life and he never forgot it. &#145;I'll always remember&#146;, said he in 1934, &#145;the pit from which I was digged and the long uphill road I had to travel. I'll never forget one step&#146;  (J. S. Stewart to Alice Millar, Bennett's private secretary, 27 Sept 1947, Bennett MSS).<br>
<br>After attending Fredericton Normal School in New Brunswick, Bennett started work as a schoolteacher when he was sixteen years old, and for the next four years, from 1886 to 1890, he eked out a living teaching at Douglastown, a lumber village on the Miramichi River in north-eastern New Brunswick. But he saved enough to put himself through law school at Dalhousie University, Halifax, in 1890&#150;93. He did remarkably well, eschewing all but work, study, and debating. His record was sufficiently remarkable that Dalhousie's dean of law, R. C. Weldon, also MP for Albert county, 1887&#150;96, in the Canadian House of Commons, recommended Bennett to a fellow Conservative, Senator James Loughheed of Calgary. Loughheed was looking for an able young lawyer and possible junior partner. At this point, 1896, Bennett had taken up a law practice in Chatham, New Brunswick, on the Miramichi, his familiar territory. But the call of western opportunity was strong and in January 1897, his law books preceding him, young Bennett, tall, lean, and twenty-six years old, got off the Canadian Pacific Railway train in Calgary, Alberta. It was bitterly cold, with a thin skiff of snow holding down the dirt and dust of the streets; Calgary was a cow town of some 4000 people, new, raw, and as Bennett added in letters back to New Brunswick, with not all that much business.<br>
<br>Bennett was a very eastern looking denizen of Calgary. He dressed meticulously. He was not like the local Calgary lawyers, but then he never was one to emulate the crowd. He took the world on his own terms, with his own standards of what an able, upright, advocate should, or should not, do. He neither drank nor smoked. He did not swear; his expletive nearest to swearing was &#145;Blast!&#146; He had a vigorous and retentive mind; he worked like a horse, long hours with little or no play; there was in fact only a little play in him.<br>
<br>The Loughheed&#150;Bennett practice went slowly at first; but by 1900 Calgary was expanding, with land, farming, ranching (and by the 1920s oil). Bennett's reputation grew with it as an honest, versatile, clever, and persistent lawyer; he took silk in 1905 and by 1914 had an extremely busy and profitable practice, and with a substantial clutch of business ventures and investments as well.<h2>
<a name="Conservativepolitician"></a>Conservative politician</h2>Bennett was by this time well into Conservative politics. A vigorous, not to say voluble, debater, not afraid of challenges, confident, perhaps too confident, of his own mind and opinions, he took on the Alberta Liberal establishment. He was elected first in 1898 for Calgary West to the territorial legislature at Regina. After Alberta's creation as a province in 1905, with its new capital in Edmonton, he was put forward by friends in 1909 for the new 41-seat Alberta legislature. In that election the Liberals took thirty-seven seats; there was one socialist and three Conservatives. Of this narrow and unpromising opposition he was soon the spokesman, giving the Liberal government no quarter. In 1911 he ran in the Canadian general election for Calgary West and won. That rare being, a successful western Conservative, he was now a formidable voice, though not one brought easily under party discipline.<br>
<br>Bennett's views on Canadian railways, tariffs, on Canada's proper position within the British empire, were in advance of those of the Conservative Party leader, Robert Borden. To his old friend Max Aitken, now in London contemplating entry into British politics, Bennett wrote on 13 November 1910:<blockquote>Your problem is how best to serve the Empire. It is too bad that such erroneous ideas should prevail in England about Canada and the Empire. I am convinced that the real crisis in the life of our Empire is now upon us. If the Empire is to endure the self-governing nations which compose it must in some way be federated. Unless there is a recognition of common interests, common traditions, &amp; above all common responsibilities and obligations, and that too within the lifetime of this generation, independence is inevitable not of Canada alone but of all the nations that now make up the Empire. In Canada the situation is really acute. (Beaverbrook MSS, vol. 66)</blockquote>That prescient letter sums up much of Bennett's imperial ideas then and later.<br>
<br>Bennett was a restive back-bencher in the Canadian House of Commons. He was never much of a follower, ready to quarrel with party leaders on what he felt were important issues of principle. But he was so able a parliamentarian, so valuable an assistant, that Borden took him to England in 1915 as adviser, and on a tour of the battlefields of France. Both men came home dissatisfied with British conduct of the war. In October 1916 Bennett was appointed director of the Canadian National Service, an inventory of Canada's male population. In his view this was not a prelude to conscription but an effective substitute for it, rationalizing manpower in all aspects of war, army, industrial production, and farming. He wanted to make sure that useful farmers and workers were not sent needlessly off to the western front. Like Borden, he was still confident that Canada's war effort could go forward without conscription. But the battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917 changed that. The Canadian army lost 10,000 men in that battle and that April produced only 4000 recruits. Bennett believed that the war now required conscription though still not at the expense of sacrificing Canada's farm labour.<br>
<br>Bennett was chagrined that the prime minister, Robert Borden, did not appoint him to the senate in February 1918, something that Bennett believed he had been promised. That humiliation&#151;for so he regarded it&#151;was partly assuaged by his being appointed minister of justice in 1920 under a new Conservative prime minister, Arthur Meighen, Borden having retired from politics owing to ill health. But in the general election of December 1921 the Meighen government was defeated and Bennett with it. Just then he was called to England on an appeal in one of his cases at the judicial committee of the privy council.<h2>
<a name="Returntolawpractice"></a>Return to law practice</h2>Bennett was already thinking of moving to England, losing interest in his Calgary law practice. But when his partner, Sir James Loughheed, with a minimum of consultation and arrangement, arbitrarily chose to use Bennett's absence in England to dissolve the old partnership, Bennett, after an acrimonious exchange of cables, returned from England in high dudgeon. He went straight to Calgary and established his own law firm. It would fare much better than his old partnership with Loughheed. That accident of circumstance would keep him in Canada for the eventful next seventeen years.<br>
<br>Bennett was by this time a millionaire. In 1925 he had an annual income from professional fees and business of some $90,000. He was elected to the House of Commons in the general elections in 1925 and in 1926, and Meighen appointed him minister of finance in 1926 during Meighen's brief three-month tenure as prime minister. Meighen then resigned the leadership of the Conservative Party, and the party for the first time called a national convention, set for Winnipeg in October 1927, to select a new leader.<br>
<br>In the meantime Bennett had to deal with his serious responsibilities for the E. B. Eddy Company, a huge match and pulp and paper conglomerate that stretched along the Quebec shore of the Ottawa River for 2 miles. Bennett owned just over half of Eddy's 3000 shares. How that came to be went back to Bennett's days on the Miramichi in the 1890s. One of his acquaintances was Jennie Shirreff, some nine years older than Bennett. She had trained as a nurse in Boston, and in 1894 in Halifax married E. B. Eddy, a 67-year-old widower who had created the Eddy Company. Eddy died in 1906 and his widow inherited his control of the company. The Quebec government demanded succession duties on such a scale that Jennie Shirreff Eddy needed expert legal advice and at once. She called on Bennett, whom she knew had the tough legal skills she needed. Eddys was also profitable: dividends in 1907 were 14 per cent and in 1910 reached 50 per cent. Bennett was drawn into the company more and more, becoming the senior legal adviser, and was so influential that when Mrs Eddy died in 1921 she left 500 shares to him and 1007 shares to her brother. The latter died in 1926 and left his shares to Bennett who now held 1508 shares, at that time worth about $1.5 million.<br>
<br>The Winnipeg convention of October 1927 elected R. B. Bennett leader of the Conservative Party. He was now leader of the opposition. He set about getting rid of some of the more important corporate commitments, directorships especially, that would get in the way of political responsibilities. Eddys was sold to Bryant and May, the English company, late in 1927; many of Bennett's other directorships, and some substantial blocks of stock, were given up in 1928. It was a good time to be unloading stock!<h2>
<a name="PrimeministerofCanada19301935"></a>Prime minister of Canada, 1930&#150;1935</h2>The depression that followed the 1929 crash made it easier for the Bennett Conservatives to win the general election of July 1930. The Liberal regime of Mackenzie King was defeated partly by issues arising from the gathering force of the worldwide economic dislocations. Bennett promised measures that would cure those effects on the Canadian economy and would push Canadian exports into the markets of the world. A strikingly successful businessman and politician, he was listened to and believed. He and his party won the election of July 1930 with 137 seats in the 245-seat House of Commons. He was sworn in as prime minister, minister of external affairs, and minister of finance on 7 August 1930. He had now to deliver on his promises to the Canadian electorate. It was not going to be easy.<br>
<br>There was an early session of parliament in September 1930 to provide emergency funds for the unemployed. Bennett, his party, and the public expected orthodox solutions to Canada's problems in the world economic crisis. He went to the Imperial Conference in London later that autumn, where he urged an economic union of the British empire, with free admission of empire natural products into the British market, in return for what would be, presumably under certain conditions, free entry of British goods into the Canadian market. The Ottawa economic conference of 1932, called and presided over by Bennett, was to be the capping stone of this policy. It did not work all that well. Britain was not ready to exclude foreign wheat and lumber, and Canadian manufacturers were unwilling to allow free admission of British goods. What emerged were complex bilateral treaties between different segments of the empire. Nevertheless, trade between Canada and the rest of the empire rose considerably; Canadian exports rose by 51 per cent over the next two years, most of the increase being between Canada and Great Britain.<br>
<br>In 1931 and 1932 the judicial committee of the privy council reversed policies of many years' standing. The privy council's rulings in Canadian constitutional cases for half a century had favoured the provinces in legal battles with the central government. Now with new questions of jurisdiction, aviation, and radio broadcasting, the privy council gave the federal government control over them. Bennett acted. The Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission was established in 1932, the immediate predecessor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The following year he appointed Lord Macmillan as royal commissioner to examine the possibility of establishing a central bank, the Bank of Canada. This was done in 1934 in the teeth of the resistance of the Canadian private chartered banks.<br>
<br>In 1935, with the depression still grinding down the country, exports still languishing, and conditions in the prairies truly desperate, Bennett went much further. Overcoming resistance within his own cabinet and his party, he established the <span class="roman">Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act</span>, and, more dramatically, the <span class="roman">Employment and Social Insurance Act</span>, the latter the centrepiece of what came to be called the Bennett New Deal. This social legislation, as the name suggests, was inspired superficially by the Roosevelt New Deal in the United States, but its social core was the Methodist Bennett of old. When asked about it, he would pull out his speeches in his first days as an MP in 1911, or his address on becoming party leader in 1927. This leftish social legislation did not sit well with older members of the party, particularly the business elements from Montreal and Toronto. Moreover, to the electorate as a whole it seemed like a last-minute conversion, for Bennett had to have an election in 1935. On top of those questions, the Conservative Party was weakened by the defection of H. H. Stevens, one of Bennett's ablest and most popular ministers, whose royal commission on price spreads was revealing how big business was systematically undercutting the small businessman.<br>
<br>Thus came the election of 14 October 1935, which Bennett fought boldly and lost. Probably no government would have survived five years of the depression of the 1930s. But he took the defeat much to heart, especially its devastation of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons. With 30 per cent of the popular vote, the Conservatives took only 16 per cent of the seats; the Liberals, with 45 per cent of the popular vote, took 71 per cent of the seats. So the Conservatives in 1935 elected only 40 members, the Liberals 173, others 32.<br>
<br>Bennett was not well. In March 1935 he had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation of the heart. He might then have resigned, but the forthcoming election and the defection of Stevens put him squarely on his mettle, and he carried on despite the heavy drain on his hitherto superabundant energy. Indeed as leader of the opposition from 1935 to 1938, he was still one of the most vital and vigorous members of the House of Commons. Finally, however, in March 1938 he resigned the leadership of the Conservative Party.<h2>
<a name="Retirementpeerageanddeath"></a>Retirement, peerage, and death</h2>A private tragedy now was upon him. In May 1938 Bennett's sister Mildred died of breast cancer in a New York hospital. She was only forty-nine years old. Mildred had been the light of his life. Born in 1889, three years after Bennett had left home, a surprise baby to her mother, Mildred was always something more than a sister to him. He had looked after her education and as she grew into an attractive young woman, she became his hostess and companion. She had qualities that Bennett lacked. She loved a party, she could dance, she liked champagne; she had what men called charm, that is, vivacity, a sense of humour, tact, and a willingness to listen. She had also great political sagacity, and she had much to do with Bennett's victory in the 1930 election. Mildred had the moral sweep of Shaw's Candida and her death stunned her brother. Bennett shut himself up in his suite in the Ch&acirc;teau Laurier, reading aloud the book of <span class="roman">Ruth</span>, &#145;And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go &hellip; ought but death part thee and me.&#146;<br>
<br>Bennett had been a bachelor all his life, but certainly not a misogynistic one. There had been ladies who wanted him, and after Mildred's marriage in 1931 to W. D. Herridge, Canadian minister to the United States, he had certainly wanted at least one lady, a rich and handsome Montreal widow, Hazel Kemp Colville. After two years she broke off relations. Bennett would not have been the most tractable of husbands: gifted, energetic, honest, generous, with integrity beyond the reach of most businessmen of his time, he could also be temperamental, autocratic, and impatient. Mildred knew how to handle him, and also his long-serving secretary, Alice Millar; few others did.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1938 Bennett decided he would live in England. His ample means allowed him to buy a substantial 60 acre property at Juniper Hill, Mickleham, Surrey, next to that of Max Aitken, now Beaverbrook. He moved his books and effects from Ottawa and Calgary to England, and after effecting at some expense those very necessary Canadian improvements, central heating and substantial new plumbing, he came to settle in at Juniper Hill, not unhappily. He had things to do; there was his house, garden, and grounds; after the war started he was recruited by Beaverbrook to help at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, and there was an abundance of charities. He was also a justice of the peace, and occasionally sat on the local bench at Dorking. His social life was considerable and he commuted back and forth from Mickleham to London by chauffeur-driven car. In June 1941 he was made Viscount Bennett of Mickleham, Calgary, and Hopewell, the result of Beaverbrook's lobbying with Churchill. In the House of Lords he was not a viscount <i>fain&eacute;ant</i>; his not infrequent interventions were usually pertinent and informed.<br>
<br>In 1944 Bennett was diagnosed with diabetes and from then on had to take insulin every day. He loved chocolates and never stinted his food. He always claimed sugar did not ruin families: alcohol did. He also liked his hot baths and had his butler to help. On 26 June 1947 he had been in London all day; it was warm. Epps, his butler, was sent off for the evening; Bennett would not bathe that night. But he changed his mind, and died in his bath of a heart attack. He was buried on 30 June at St Michael's, Mickleham.<br>
<br>Bennett had considerable gifts: a quick intelligence, a tenacious memory, enormous energy, and a huge appetite for work. As prime minister he took on too much; he was rarely satisfied with the work and functioning of his colleagues, and would often say so with his mordant wit and sarcastic style. That did not always endear him to his associates. His style of dress, formal and stiff whether in Calgary or Ottawa, suggested he was rich even before he became so. In the depression years in Canada it was easy to cartoon him as crass, wealthy, overbearing, and unfeeling. While that had some truth in it some of the time, it was a gross distortion of his real character. His reputation has suffered ever since, in many respects unjustly. He gave his best to Canada at a very difficult time and was ill rewarded for it.<br>
