<span class="headword">Faussett,  Bryan</span>  (1720&#150;1776), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 30 October 1720 at Heppington, near Canterbury, the eldest of the thirteen children of Bryan Faussett (<i>d</i>. 1750) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1761), daughter and sole heir of Henry Godfrey of Heppington and Lydd, Kent. After schooling in Kent, Faussett went up to University College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1742 and MA in 1745. He shared his father's Jacobite sympathies, and tried at Oxford to raise a force of volunteers to support the Young Pretender. Earlier, in 1742, he was rusticated for six months for entertaining a prostitute in his college rooms. When he applied for a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, as founder's kin, he was turned down on the ground that he was not a person of &#145;chaste and virtuous life&#146;; but he appealed successfully to the college's visitor, the archbishop of Canterbury. He enjoyed the fellowship for two years, and then in 1748 was presented by All Souls to the Shropshire living of Alberbury.<br>
<br>Faussett was later to declare: &#145;I went into Shropshire a stranger, and was caressed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kentish Parson</span>, 127). In his two years there he married in 1748 Elizabeth Curtois (<i>bap</i>. 1714), daughter of the Revd Rowland Curtois and his wife Elizabeth of Hainton, Lincolnshire, and saw their first son born, and, it seems, fitted happily into local society. In retrospect, he regretted reacting to his father's death in 1750 by returning to Kent. He lived at Street End House, near Heppington, and then, after his mother too had died, in 1761, he enjoyed full control of the family estates and occupied the house at Heppington.<br>
<br>Despite his considerable wealth, Faussett was a disappointed, perhaps even embittered, man. He felt neglected by the gentry and higher clergy of east Kent. According to Dean Lynch he was &#145;never properly introduced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kentish Parson</span>, 127), and his friend Joseph Price wrote that Faussett &#145;does not agree long with anybody&#146;  (ibid., 128). He was curate at Kingston from 1750 until 1756, but it rankled that he had to wait until 1765 to obtain a benefice of his own: Archbishop Secker presented him that year to the rectory of Monks' Horton. Secker himself may later have regretted his kindness, especially when he was advised that Faussett was &#145;a man subject to passion, and to utter at such times very unclerical language&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.355). Faussett did not reside there, but held the living until his death.<br>
<br>Faussett at first used some of his leisure to engage in heraldic and genealogical research, and made careful notes of the monuments in nearly every church east of a line from Ashford to Faversham (though excluding Romney Marsh and Thanet); he also collected coins. In 1757, however, he walked one day with the rector of Crundale to Tremworth Down to look at the site of a Roman burial-ground which had been dug up fifty years earlier. The parish clerk remembered the location of these graves, and the expedition so aroused Faussett's curiosity that he was fired with an ever-growing passion for investigating ancient burials. Over the next sixteen years he was to be responsible for the opening of some 750 ancient burial-mounds and graves on and around the east Kent downs.<br>
<br>Faussett never grasped that most of the graves were of the Anglo-Saxon period: he thought them to be of &#145;Romans Britonized&#146; and &#145;Britons Romanized&#146;. He could not identify post-Roman coins. But as an archaeological recorder he showed prescient skill in drawing up an extremely careful and precise narrative account, with a limited number of sketches, of all that he and his labourers found. Writing first in a field notebook and then preparing a fair copy for one of the series of journals that together formed what he called his <span class="italic">Inventorium sepulchrale</span>, he provided a remarkably consistent and full picture of the contents of each grave that was opened: not just the glass and occasional metal artefacts that he particularly valued, but all the other grave goods, bones, and coffin parts that survived. His ability to age and sex skeletons and his awareness of details such as tooth wear and tooth loss, with reabsorption of sockets, as factors in the ageing process, suggest that he had studied anatomy when at Oxford.<br>
<br>Faussett continued to have barrows dug up even when he was so afflicted by gout that he had to watch and direct operations from his coach. It was in such circumstances that he gained from grave 205 on Kingston Down, in August 1771, his greatest prize, the largest Kentish jewelled gold composite disc-brooch ever discovered. Overall, his collection contained about 400 jewelled pieces, and until the discovery of the Sutton Hoo treasure it was the finest array of Anglo-Saxon antiquities in the country.<br>
<br>Faussett died at Heppington on 10 February 1776 and was buried in Nackington church. He and his wife had had four children; their elder son, Henry Godfrey, had helped Faussett in his excavations and was the actual discoverer of the Kingston brooch. The collection long remained the property of the family, almost unknown to scholars until the 1840s. Faussett's great-grandson Bryan Faussett sold 5000 coins at Sothebys on 3 December 1853; the British Museum declined to buy the Anglo-Saxon antiquities and in 1855 these were purchased by Joseph Mayer, whose collections were later given to the Liverpool Museum. Mayer arranged for the <span class="italic">Inventorium sepulchrale</span> to be edited by Charles Roach Smith in 1856.<br>
<br>Faussett had decorated a garden pavilion at Heppington with some larger antiquities, including a terracotta relief from Roman London, a font bowl from Kingston church, and what he called King Canute: a late twelfth-century head of a biblical prophet from Canterbury Cathedral. When the pavilion was demolished in 1950, most of its contents were given to the Canterbury Museum. His library and some of his papers were dispersed onto the market around 1990.<br>
