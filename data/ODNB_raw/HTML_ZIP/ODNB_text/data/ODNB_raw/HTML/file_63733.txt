<span class="headword">Booth,  (William) Bramwell</span>  (1856&#150;1929), <span class="occ">Salvation Army officer</span>, was born at Halifax, Yorkshire, on 8 March 1856, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31968/', "William Booth (1829&#150;1912)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2874/', "Catherine Booth, n&#233;e Mumford (1829&#150;1890)")</script>, the founders of the Salvation Army. He had two brothers and five sisters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49017/', "Catherine Booth-Clibborn")</script>; all the children shared their parents' itinerant lifestyle until the family settled in London in 1865. Bramwell Booth saw the army grow from an obscure Christian mission, established in Whitechapel, into an international organization with numerous and varied social activities. He was educated at home and, briefly, a preparatory school and at the City of London School, where he was bullied. Known to his family as Willie, his health was poor, with digestive ailments, and he had a slight hearing loss. William and Catherine Booth set high standards for their children and Bramwell, as the eldest, found the weight of parental expectation particularly heavy. He was often responsible for his younger siblings, and both parents, William more than Catherine, took young Bramwell into their confidence. In 1870 he went to help in the management of his father's mission and in the cheap food kitchens established in its early days. It was as a teenager that the course of Bramwell's life was set; his parents were totally committed to their work and Bramwell, despite his early wishes to study medicine and his fear of public speaking, became William Booth's amanuensis, adviser, and administrator.<br>
<br>On 12 October 1882 Bramwell married Florence Soper [<a name="cosubject_63733"></a><span class="headword">Florence Eleanor Booth</span>  (1861&#150;1957)<span class="occ"></span>], who was born at Blaenau, Monmouthshire, on 12 September 1861, the eldest daughter of Isabell Hawker Soper (1831/2&#150;1907), surgeon, and his wife, Jane Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levick. Florence had joined the Salvation Army in 1880 and worked in France with Bramwell's sister Catherine. After her marriage she took charge of the women's social work. All of their seven children (five daughters and two sons) became active workers in the army.<br>
<br>Bramwell Booth was chief of staff of the Salvation Army from 1881 until his father's death in August 1912. Through Booth's guidance the right to hold open-air meetings&#151;an issue which had brought the army into conflict with many local authorities&#151;was firmly established. In 1885 he was associated with William Thomas Stead (1849&#150;1912) in an attempt to publicize the traffic in young girls, which resulted in the spectacular July 1885 &#145;Maiden tribute of modern Babylon&#146; revelations in Stead's <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and the passing of the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span> of 1885 raising the age of consent to sixteen years. Owing to Stead's bungling and a technical breach of the law in the collecting of evidence, Booth, Stead, and Rebecca Jarrett, a converted brothel-keeper who assisted them, were arrested and tried at the Old Bailey. Booth was acquitted but the others served prison terms.<br>
<br>William Booth appointed Bramwell his successor. Like his father, Bramwell ruled autocratically, and expected complete obedience. However, what officers would tolerate from William (already glorified as &#145;The Founder&#146;) they would not take from Bramwell. Bramwell was enough of his father's son to stamp down on perceived insubordination and he summarily retired officers with little cause, but seemed to lack his father's willingness to forgive (and reappoint) former objects of his wrath. Allegedly he gave his children posts for which others were better qualified. Discontent simmered among senior officers, including some of Bramwell's brothers and sisters. In his last years he increasingly handed control to his wife, who was given power of attorney when he was away travelling. She had acted as the army's &#145;first lady&#146; since his mother died in 1890, and she started several army organizations including the Home League, Girl Guards, and League of Mercy.<br>
<br>As chief executive officer Booth was responsible for the preparation of <span class="italic">Orders and Regulations for Officers and Soldiers</span> and for the direction of the army's propaganda and operations. He wrote <span class="italic">Echoes and Memories</span> (1925), <span class="italic">These Fifty Years</span> (1929), and other books, as well as many articles on <span class="roman">Bible</span> studies and social problems, and frequent contributions to the press on prison reform, vagrancy, the homeless poor, and emigration. Bramwell did much to develop foreign missions, both as chief of staff and as general of the army. During his generalship the army made rapid progress, and he travelled extensively on its behalf.<br>
<br>The early years of Bramwell's generalship were complicated by the First World War, which threatened the international character of the Salvation Army. Bramwell was able to steer a course that neither offended German salvationists nor outraged British public opinion. As time wore on, senior officers, including Bramwell's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62097/', "Evangeline Cory Booth")</script>, began to question his leadership. In May 1928 Bramwell's health began to deteriorate, and by September he was suffering from insomnia and depression. His poor health offered those in the army who were dissatisfied with his leadership an opportunity to act, and in January 1929 the army's high council of leading officers was summoned to adjudicate on his fitness for duty. He was relieved of the generalship in February 1929 and a successor elected by the high council.<br>
<br>Bramwell Booth bore a strong facial likeness to his mother. Like both of his parents, Bramwell suffered much from poor health and adopted a vegetarian diet as a means of maintaining his rather fragile constitution. On the platform he presented a striking contrast to his father: the latter played on his hearers' emotions, his son relied on calm and reasoned argument. He was something of a mystic; none the less he inherited his father's flair with finance and property. Although mild and sensitive, he had inherited enough of his father's inflexibility and his mother's didacticism to preclude easy relations with his brothers and sisters and other senior officers; his loyalty to the Salvation Army was unquestionable and lifelong. He was &#145;promoted to Glory&#146; on 16 June 1929 at his home, The Homestead, Hadley Wood, near Barnet, Hertfordshire, and was buried near his parents in Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, London. Huge numbers attended his funeral. He was commemorated by the Bramwell Booth Memorial Hall, Queen Victoria Street, London. He was survived by his wife, who died at her home at Finchampstead, Berkshire, on 10 June 1957.<br>
