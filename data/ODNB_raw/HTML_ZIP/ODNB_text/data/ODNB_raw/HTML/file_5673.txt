<span class="headword">Cline,  Henry</span>  (1750&#150;1827), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born in London, was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London. His sister, Frances, was the mother of the surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11393/', "Joseph Henry Green (1791&#150;1863)")</script>. At the age of seventeen Cline was apprenticed to Thomas Smith, one of the surgeons to St Thomas's Hospital, London, and during his apprenticeship he frequently lectured for Joseph Else, then lecturer on anatomy. On 2 June 1774 Cline obtained his diploma from Surgeons' Hall. In the same year he attended a course of John Hunter's lectures, and as a result became a strong supporter of Hunter. In 1775 Cline took a house in Devonshire Street, and married a Miss Webb, lecturing on the day of his marriage. They had at least one son and one daughter. When Else died in 1781, Cline bought his preparations from his executors, and was appointed to lecture on anatomy. Three years later, on the death of his old master, Smith, Cline succeeded him as a surgeon to St Thomas's.<br>
<br>According to Astley Cooper, who became his pupil in 1784, Cline was &#145;in surgery cool, safe, judicious, and cautious; in anatomy sufficiently informed for teaching and practice&#146;  (Cooper, 1.98). Despite such ability, Cooper considered that Cline liked &#145;other things better than the study or practice of his profession&#146;  (ibid.). A democrat at a time when the term was synonymous with &#145;subversive&#146;, Cline was a friend of Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, visiting the former when he was confined in the Tower and giving evidence for the latter at his treason trial in 1794. For years afterwards Cline held an annual dinner at his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields to commemorate Horne Tooke's acquittal. Cline also used his influence to secure Astley Cooper's safety during his stay in Paris in 1792. A patriot in the true sense of the word, and a deist in religion, Cline was a man of integrity. His character, said Astley Cooper, &#145;was that of Washington; he would have devoted himself to what he considered to be the advantage of his country, and surrendered whatever distinction he might have attained when he had accomplished his object&#146;  (Cooper, 2.338). After living for some years in Jefferies' Square, 12 St Mary Axe, Cline moved in 1796 to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he remained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1796 Cline was elected a member of the court of assistants of the Surgeons' Company; but the fact that his election took place at a meeting when neither of the two governors was present (one having just died) was found to have contravened the act of incorporation.<br>
<br>In 1808 Cline, having become interested in agriculture, bought some land at Bounds Green in Middlesex. This venture, together with his interest in politics, lost him the chance to increase his income. Although Cline earned about &pound;10,000 in 1810, Astley Cooper considered that it could have been far more, had he devoted himself to cultivating his practice. In 1810 Cline became an examiner at the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1812 resigned his appointments at St Thomas's, to be succeeded as surgeon by his son Henry (<i>d</i>. 1820). In 1815 he became master of the College of Surgeons, and in the following year delivered the Hunterian oration (never published); he gave the oration again in 1824. In 1823 Cline was president of the college, the title having been changed from that of master in 1821. He died at his home at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 2 January 1827, a short time after catching an ague. His only publication was <span class="italic">On the Form of Animals</span> (1805).<br>
