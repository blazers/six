<span class="headword">Bourne,  Immanuel</span>  (1590&#150;1672), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born on 27 December 1590, the eldest son of Henry Bourne (<i>d</i>. 1649), clergyman, and his wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bright), of Gray Stones near Sheffield. In 1595 his father became minister of East Haddon, Northamptonshire. Immanuel matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 6 May 1608, graduated BA on 29 January 1612, was ordained deacon at Oxford in February 1613 and priest in March 1614, and proceeded MA on 12 June 1616.<br>
<br>An early indication of Bourne's taste for controversy was his Paul's Cross sermon of 10 June 1617: <span class="italic">The Rainebow</span>, published that year with a dedication to Robert Spencer of Wormleighton, was a brave, if forlorn, attempt to enlist the support of the arch-encloser of Northamptonshire against depopulating enclosures. Another Paul's Cross sermon, delivered on 22 August 1619 and published as <span class="italic">The Godly Man's Guide</span> (1620), was addressed to &#145;merchants and tradesmen&#146;. About 1619 William Piers (the future Laudian bishop of Bath and Wells), another Christ Church man and a former Northamptonshire rector, but by this time rector of St Christopher-le-Stocks, London, appointed Bourne as preacher in his parish. Here he became chaplain to Sir Samuel Tryon and his wife, Elizabeth, in whose household he met his own future wife, Jemima (<i>c</i>.1602&#150;1679), daughter of Sir Thomas Beckingham of Tolleshunt Major, Essex; she was Lady Tryon's young cousin and companion. On Tryon's presentation, Bourne was instituted to the living of Ashover, in the Derbyshire Peak District, on 11 July 1621. Further publications followed, <span class="italic">The True Way of a Christian, to the New Jerusalem</span> appearing in 1622 and <span class="italic">The Anatomie of Conscience</span>, an assize sermon preached at Derby, in 1623.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1623, by licence dated 7 July, Bourne married Jemima; the couple had at least three sons&#151;Elisha (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1625), Samuel (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1628), and Obadiah (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1634)&#151;and four daughters, Jemima, Mary&#151;who subsequently married the local preacher John Billingsley (1625&#150;1684) and was mother of John Billingsley (1657&#150;1622)&#151;Lidiah, and Dorothy. In 1625 and 1630 Bourne bought extensive property in Ashover, including Eastwood Hall, and he later purchased the advowson of Ashover, thus assuring the future of his sons. Family ties with Derbyshire strengthened further at this period as his younger brothers Nathaniel (<i>b</i>. 1601/2) and Elisha (<i>b</i>. 1604/5) also gained livings there. Bourne himself sat on the commission of the peace for the county, and was related to another local JP, John Spateman. In 1639 he was prosecuted by high commission for organizing a fast day during time of plague in contravention of a royal proclamation; the case set him back by &pound;300. He also took his own parishioners to court for their lead tithe debts.<br>
<br>Bourne claimed that, at the outset of the civil war, he adopted a neutral position. This did not protect him: indeed, both sides victimized him. When Sir John Gell left Derbyshire to the earl of Newcastle's men, the cavaliers, &#145;like demons, destroyed all they came neare and left the poore to starve&#146;. Bourne lost, in this way, all his books and &#145;my Manuscripts, near thirty years studies and pains night and day rent in pieces and taken away&#146;  (Bourne, <span class="italic">Light from Christ</span>, 7). He began to side with parliament. He ceased to pray for the king in public, left marriages to the JPs, and, when &#145;the kyng's cause became hopeless&#146;, accepted an appointment on the committee of sequestration, &#145;thinking thereby to soften some of the hard measures dealt out to the kyng's friends&#146;  (I. Bourne to W. Bourne, 28 Aug 1646, Derby Public Library, Ashover Collection). He was briefly in 1646 rector of Calbourne in the Isle of Wight and became preacher at St Sepulchre, Holborn, in London, because Derbyshire was neither &#145;safe nor comfortable abiding&#146;. In June 1646, recently returned to Ashover, Bourne found the parliamentary troops were busy taking over his church and hall to prevent their falling into malignants' hands.<br>
<br>Bourne was always a high clericalist by conviction. According to his <span class="italic">A Light from Christ</span>, a catechism first published in 1645 and reissued, enlarged, in 1646, ministers were &#145;ordained by Christ, in a special calling above others, to be instruments or outwards of converting men and women unto Christ&#146;  (Bourne, <span class="italic">Light from Christ</span>, 129). Although, as he later explained, his purpose in this work was to help right the &#145;sad evidences &hellip; of deplorable ignorance&#146;  (I. Bourne, <span class="italic">A Defence and Justification</span>, 1659, 5), he felt in 1646 that &#145;our Church is now in a hopeful way of Reformation&#146;  (Bourne, <span class="italic">Light from Christ</span>, 329) and he supported the introduction of a watered-down form of presbyterianism. By 1656, as a despairing member of the Chesterfield classis debating with James Naylor, he had lost his optimism. That year he became rector of Waltham on the Wolds, Leicestershire, and laid out his position on the ordination controversy in <span class="italic">A Defence of the Scriptures</span>. In 1659, as his youngest son, Obadiah, a graduate of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, was instituted to the Ashover rectory, he published <span class="italic">A Defence and Justification of Ministers' Maintenance by Tithes</span>.<br>
<br>Unlike his son-in-law John Billingsley, Bourne retained his living in 1662, but he was still prepared to challenge his social superiors. His <span class="italic">A Golden Chain of Directions to Preserve Love between Husband and Wife</span> (1669) roundly criticized his patron, the earl of Rutland, for his divorce and remarriage. In 1670 Bourne became rector of Aylestone, Leicestershire. He died at Ashover on 27 December 1672, his eighty-second birthday, and was buried, at his request, in the chancel of Ashover church. He left a substantial library. His will of 1671 made his widow, Jemima, &#145;with whom I have lived comfortablie fifty yeares&#146;, his executor, providing from his private property for her, for his surviving son, Obadiah, still rector of Ashover, and for all future rectors there. His grandson Samuel Bourne (1653&#150;1694), son of his eldest son, Elisha, was designated, and became, Obadiah's successor.<br>
