<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Geoffrey Anketell  Studdert</span>  (1883&#150;1929), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born on 27 June 1883 in Leeds, the seventh child in the family of seven sons and two daughters of the Revd William Studdert Kennedy, vicar of St Mary's, Quarry Hill, Leeds, and his second wife, Jeanette Anketell. There were also one son and four daughters of a first marriage. Educated at Leeds grammar school, he graduated in classics and divinity at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1904, after which he taught for two years at a school in West Kirby in Liverpool. Following a year of ordination training at Ripon Clergy College he was ordained in 1908 to a curacy at Rugby parish church, moving from there in 1912 to be curate at Leeds parish church. In 1914 he married Emily, daughter of Alfred Catlow, coal merchant; they had three sons. Appointed that same year as vicar of St Paul's, Worcester, in 1915 he became a chaplain to the armed forces and began the wartime ministry among the troops in France and Flanders for which he is most remembered.<br>
<br>Studdert Kennedy's considerable natural gifts as a preacher were combined with a talent for poetry, particularly dialect verse in the manner of the barrack-room ballads of Rudyard Kipling. In the carnage and suffering of the trenches his strongly sacramental Christianity was communicated in memorable addresses and in colloquial verse of sometimes powerful simplicity, which brought together the passion of Christ and the doubt, fear, and courage of soldiers caught in the squalid stalemate of the Flanders trenches. Studdert Kennedy preached a suffering God, Christ the revealer, &#145;pierced to the heart by the sorrow of the sword&#146;  (Wilkinson, 138). The experience of war made him question both the metaphysical assumption of an impassible God, and the hortatory patriotic moralism of many contemporary churchmen and political leaders. He could contrast sharply (in <span class="italic">Peace Rhymes of a Padre</span>) the God of glory in Isaiah's vision with the God revealed in the suffering Christ:<blockquote>
<div>God, I hate this splendid vision&#151;all its splendour is a lie &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>And I hate the God of power on His hellish heavenly throne &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Thou hast bid us seek Thy glory, in a criminal crucified &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>For the very God of Heaven is not Power, but Power of Love.<br>
</div> (Wilkinson, 137)</blockquote>A bitter poem from the end of the war saw the statesmen who were meeting at Versailles to agree to a peace treaty as those who crucified Christ anew. After the war a number of volumes of Studdert Kennedy's collected poems were published, the most notable being <span class="italic">Rough Rhymes of a Padre</span> (1918), <span class="italic">Peace Rhymes of a Padre</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Songs of Faith and Doubt</span> (1922), and <span class="italic">The Unutterable Beauty</span> (1927).<br>
<br>Given the nickname Woodbine Willie by the troops, Studdert Kennedy once described his chaplain's ministry as taking &#145;a box of fags in your haversack, and a great deal of love in your heart&#146;  (Mozley, 141) and laughing and joking with those he was called to serve. &#145;You can pray with them sometimes; but pray for them always&#146;  (ibid.). Ministering on the front line under fire he showed conspicuous bravery and was awarded the MC for his tending of the wounded under fire during the attack on the Messines Ridge. He was slightly built and liked to joke in public about his prominent ears and simian features, though contemporaries were much more likely to be arrested by the large and melancholy brown eyes.<br>
<br>Demobilized in 1919, Studdert Kennedy was appointed a chaplain to the king. In 1922 he left his Worcester parish to run the church of St Edmund King and Martyr in Lombard Street in the City of London, a non-parochial cure, which left him free for his major post-war work as &#145;messenger&#146; of the Industrial Christian Fellowship (ICF), which had come into being in 1920 as a result of the amalgamation of the Christian Social Union and the Navvy Mission Society. Critical alike of Marxist socialism and of capitalism, Studdert Kennedy commanded considerable audiences for his addresses during the ICF's missions and crusades in the years of the depression. He was sure that his Christianity had political consequences, but that it was religion not political panaceas that met human need. Archbishop William Temple, who described him as &#145;the finest priest I have known&#146;  (Mozley, 208), characterized him as evangelical without a trace of puritanism, and fired by a strong Catholic sacramentalism, with the cross at the heart of it all. The suffering of war and the suffering of the depression were alike uniquely met by the crucified God.<br>
<br>Studdert Kennedy was on an ICF crusade at the time of his death, which occurred in Liverpool on 8 March 1929 at St Catherine's vicarage, Abercromby Square; he was survived by his wife. After a funeral ceremony in Worcester Cathedral, where a memorial plaque was erected in his memory, he was buried in St John's cemetery, Worcester.<br>
