<span class="headword">Cecil,  James Edward Hubert  Gascoyne-</span>, fourth marquess of Salisbury  (1861&#150;1947), <span class="occ">politician and lay churchman</span>, was born on 23 October 1861 at 21 Fitzroy Square, London, the eldest of the five sons and third of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32339/', "Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, successively Viscount Cranborne and third marquess of Salisbury (1830&#150;1903)")</script>, politician and later prime minister, and his wife, Georgina Caroline Alderson (1827&#150;1899). With his similarly distinguished brothers (Rupert Ernest) William Gascoyne-Cecil (1863&#150;1936), who became bishop of Exeter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32335/', "(Edgar Algernon) Robert Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32336/', "Edward Herbert Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32337/', "Hugh Richard Heathcote Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, and his two formidable sisters, (Beatrix) Maud [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50054/', "Palmer, (Beatrix) Maud, countess of Selborne")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46553/', "Gwendolen Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, James Cecil obtained his principal intellectual, religious, and moral education from his parents.<h2>
<a name="Upbringingandpoliticalapprenticeship"></a>Upbringing and political apprenticeship</h2>Contrary to contemporary aristocratic conventions, the Cecil children remained at home for most of their childhoods. From an early age their parents treated them as near equals and involved them in their own lives, expecting them to think for themselves, to justify their opinions, and to participate in the household's adult conversation. As their father was a leading politician and expert controversialist, whose many guests included statesmen, diplomats, churchmen, and intellectuals, this was an unusually bracing atmosphere which gave his children intellectual precision, robust dialectical skills, and an addiction to debate on public affairs as much between themselves as with others, continuing throughout their lives in a huge family correspondence. The children also absorbed a deep Christian faith and attachment to the Church of England, together with their father's sophisticated Conservative politics and elevated conception of aristocratic responsibilities. The effect was a distinctive practical idealism, fusing loyalty towards established institutions with a belief that privilege imposed duties, and tough-minded attention to public business with &#145;formidably developed social and political consciences&#146;  (Cecil, 259). While Lords Robert and Hugh Cecil became famously mercurial exemplars of these characteristics, James Cecil&#151;&#145;Jem&#146; to his family and styled Viscount Cranborne from 1868&#151;came to embody them with the diligence, deliberation, and dignity he thought necessary as heir to a great family tradition, to Hatfield House, and to his father's formidable legacy as prime minister, foreign secretary, and leader of the Conservative Party, the unionist alliance, and the House of Lords.<br>
<br>By comparison with his family upbringing, Cranborne learned little from his formal education at Eton College (1875&#150;8) and University College, Oxford (1880&#150;84), where he graduated BA with second-class honours in modern history&#151;an education diversified by accompanying his father on diplomatic missions to Constantinople in 1876 and to the congress of Berlin in 1878. Cranborne had no interest in team games or field sports but became an enthusiastic volunteer soldier, &#145;the second dominant secular interest in his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He joined the 4th (militia) battalion of the Bedfordshire regiment while a student, was commissioned as major in 1887, and later commanded the battalion for nearly twenty years. In his primary secular interest of politics Cranborne's family advantages were manifest, but his father nevertheless expected him to serve an apprenticeship. He became candidate not for a safe Conservative parliamentary seat but for a marginal constituency, the Darwen division of north-east Lancashire. After intensive campaigning in the general election of 1885, he defeated the Liberal candidate by five votes. He increased his majority at the general election of 1886, and thereafter received further training as one of his father's links with House of Commons opinion and as a confidant on party and government business. Only after he was defeated at Darwen in the general election of 1892 did he receive a secure seat. He was returned unopposed in 1893 in a by-election at Rochester, which he held until succeeding his father in the House of Lords in 1903.<h2>
<a name="Landownerandlaychurchman"></a>Landowner and lay churchman</h2>While Lord Cranborne, and still more on becoming Lord Salisbury, Cecil conscientiously undertook the many local and county duties expected of the territorial aristocracy. Beginning with the eldest son's estate around Cranborne Manor in Dorset, then with the rest of the properties in Hertfordshire and Lancashire, he administered family estates totalling over 20,000 acres. He was an attentive and sympathetic landlord, who regularly visited his tenants, invested in improvements, and in Dorset and Hertfordshire built some 500 cottages, often to his own design. On receiving his full inheritance in 1903 he found that the family agents had allowed urban properties in Liverpool to degenerate into slum housing. He rejected advice to sell out to speculators, as Lord Derby was doing with neighbouring properties, because he felt this &#145;a cowardly way of evading one's responsibilities&#146;  (Jones, 2.192). Instead he spent about &pound;40,000 on reconditioning the houses for the existing tenants, without raising their rents. Thereafter he retained a close interest in the problems of working-class housing, and until 1917 was president of the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association, the body dedicated to implementing Ebenezer Howard's progressive housing schemes. At Hatfield he restored the early Tudor bishop's palace, and created a muniment room for the considerable family archives. In 1919 he sold the family's London house at 20 Arlington Street which his father had enlarged for official entertainments, only to move next door to number 21, which became almost as significant as a political venue. He was a JP for Hertfordshire and chairman of its quarter sessions from 1896 to 1911, an alderman of Hertfordshire county council, a member of the visiting committee of St Albans prison, and president of numerous county associations. He was high steward of Westminster (1903) and of Hertford (1905).<br>
<br>Cranborne became a leading lay churchman, a dimension of his life he considered as important as his political career. He gave land and substantial funds for building churches and church schools. As a member of Hatfield parochial church council he served on St Albans diocesan conference, from which he was a representative in the house of laymen of Canterbury convocation and the Representative Church Council. As a founder member of the church parliamentary committee in 1893 and its chairman from 1895 to 1900, and from 1894 a member of Archbishop Benson's church committee for defence and instruction, he took a prominent part in defending and reforming the Anglican church establishments in the face of increasing radical nonconformist and secular pressures. In the House of Commons he helped organize efforts to secure increased public provision for church schools and the Unionist resistance to Welsh church disestablishment. In 1896 he introduced a private benefices bill to reform lay patronage and maintain worthy clergymen in the parishes, some provisions of which were adopted by the Unionist government in 1898. He was chairman of the Canterbury house of laymen from 1906 to 1911, and a member of the standing committee of the body supervising Church of England schools, the National Society. To the end of his life successive archbishops of Canterbury consulted him as a matter of course on political and secular aspects of church affairs.<br>
<br>Cranborne was personally devout, notably courteous and considerate towards others, and sensitive to the religious and moral dimensions of public life. His<blockquote>whole life was dominated by his resolution to be a Christian. He believed that personal Christian endeavour was the only way of life and that it was worth while to take infinite trouble to achieve that end. If he had to make an important decision he wore himself out till he was sure that he was taking one that was right. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 April 1947)</blockquote>This did not contribute to his personal ease, for all his wealth and privilege. An entirely unjustified sense of his own sinfulness and an exacting standard of public conduct aggravated a melancholic and hypochondriacal disposition, leading to periodic descents into nervous exhaustion and depression.<h2>
<a name="Marriagepeerageandministerialoffice"></a>Marriage, peerage, and ministerial office</h2>Cranborne married Lady (Cicely) Alice Gore (1867&#150;1955), the second daughter of Arthur, fifth earl of Arran, on 17 May 1887. High-spirited and a sympathetic conversationalist, she soothed her husband's self-doubts and as an energetic and popular hostess complemented his public life. She herself acquired political significance through friendships with and mediations between public figures&#151;most notably as Lord Kitchener's unofficial channel of communication with the cabinet during his dispute with Curzon over Indian military arrangements in the early 1900s. She was appointed a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Alexandra in 1903. Cranborne and his wife had four children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30911/', "Robert Arthur James Gascoyne-Cecil")</script>, who succeeded to his titles and political prominence; Lord David Cecil, the literary critic [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39801/', "Cecil, Lord (Edward Christian) David Gascoyne-")</script>]; Beatrice, who married the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35330/', "William Ormsby-Gore, later fourth Baron Harlech")</script>; and Mary, who married the future tenth duke of Devonshire.<br>
<br>In the early 1900s Cranborne reaped the public advantages of being the prime minister's eldest son. Now a lieutenant-colonel, he led the 4th Bedfordshire battalion in February 1900 on campaign in the South African War. Although not involved in combat, he was mentioned in dispatches and created CB. He was recalled early, on being appointed under-secretary to the Foreign Office in November 1900&#151;retaining a Cecil presence there on his father's relinquishing the foreign secretaryship (which he had previously held concurrently with the premiership). Cranborne's promotion was among those criticized as creating a government packed with the prime minister's relatives, satirized by Labouchere as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42039', "Hotel Cecil")</script>, and it caused particular comment because apart from his zealous churchmanship he had made little mark in the Commons. He soon attracted further criticism for tactlessness, especially in answering parliamentary questions, when personal honesty tended to prevail over departmental obfuscation in &#145;blazing indiscretions&#146;. Nevertheless, after his father's political retirement in 1902 his advancement continued under his cousin the new prime minister, A. J. Balfour. In November 1903, following his father's death in August and his succession as fourth marquess of Salisbury, he was promoted by Balfour to the cabinet as lord privy seal in the government reshuffle caused by the tariff reform crisis. He soon proved more effective in the House of Lords' discursive exchanges than in the House of Commons' debating contests. Loyal to Balfour's efforts to create a fiscal <i>via media</i> that could hold the Unionist government together, he received the additional post of president of the Board of Trade in March 1905. He retained both offices until the government resigned in December 1905.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcreed"></a>Political creed</h2>Salisbury's politics were rooted in tradition, and over three decades he was associated with three successive &#145;die-hard&#146; movements. Nevertheless he was not a reactionary. His fundamental political creed was church-and-state Conservatism, linking religious establishment as the custodian of spiritual values, a balanced secular constitution as the check upon political excess, and a propertied and dutiful &eacute;lite as the guarantee of freedom and stability. He remained loyal to his father's commitment to the union with Ireland, and adopted an imperialism conceived as an alliance of the dispersed British peoples and trusteeship over less developed peoples brought under their charge. He did not believe that democracy was necessarily good, nor that the most vocal &#145;public opinion&#146; was automatically right or representative. While acutely conscious of social and political change, he neither accepted that his aristocratic rank distanced him from modern life nor assumed that the middle classes were better attuned to its demands. He was astounded when before the general election of 1923 Baldwin told him that &#145;his own social circumstances made him a better judge of popular opinion&#146; than Salisbury, &#145;born in the purple&#146;, could be  (Cowling, <span class="italic">Impact of Labour</span>, 415), and was not surprised when Baldwin was proved wrong. While regarding defence of property and private enterprise as obviously essential, he considered preservation of social solidarity no less vital and disliked the middle-class ethos of money-making as narrow, materialistic, and likely to provoke working-class resentment. He feared the labour movement as destructive, because socialistic and tending to incite class hatred, but was otherwise sympathetic towards working-class hardships and aspirations.<br>
<br>Salisbury did not oppose reform or state intervention in principle, but considered them matters to be judged according to circumstance and merits. On economic and social issues he was pragmatic, and even progressive if the purpose was to assist individual effort and avoid class conflict. He supported various ideas for a Unionist social policy, including contributory pensions and state-organized unemployment insurance, and in 1913 chaired a party agricultural committee which proposed a minimum wage. Nevertheless he believed that the ultimate solution for social problems was &#145;beyond the sphere of politics&#146; and could not lie in &#145;public alms-giving&#146;, because they originated in &#145;moral evils and must be combatted with moral weapons&#146;  (Sykes, 669). He understood the Conservative and Unionist Party to have &#145;two main functions &hellip; To defend certain capital institutions and in everything else to go slow&#146;  (4 Sept 1916, in Boyce, 196), and judged the party's natural strategy to be &#145;the rallying of cautious men&#146; in resistance to &#145;restless change&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Tariffreformandconstitutionalcrisis"></a>Tariff reform and constitutional crisis</h2>Although Salisbury thought that limited preferential tariffs might have merits, he deplored the tariff reform movement for its clamorous radicalism and doctrinaire insistence on unpopular food taxes. In his view it jeopardized not simply Unionist electoral prospects but also the very principles and institutions that Conservatives and Unionists properly stood for:<blockquote>If it may be said to have finally made possible the destruction of the constitution, the prostitution of the Prerogative, the Repeal of the Union and the Disendowment of the Welsh Church, it will probably rank as the most costly policy in history. (Salisbury to Bonar Law, 1 May 1912, in Blake, 108)</blockquote>After the general election defeat of 1906 he tried to prevent tariff reform proscription of Unionist free-food MPs, including his brothers Robert and Hugh, but even his neighbouring East Hertfordshire Unionist Association succumbed to pressure from the tariff reform &#145;confederacy&#146;, and in 1909 he resigned as its president. Nevertheless he acquiesced in Balfour's modified version of tariff reform so far as this seemed to offer an alternative to the Liberal government's increasingly radical financial and social policies.<br>
<br>Salisbury's own efforts were concentrated on assisting Lord Lansdowne's use of the House of Lords to check Liberal measures, and Archbishop Davidson in opposing successive education bills which threatened the privileges of church schools. In 1909 he took a leading part in the House of Lords' defeat of Lloyd George's &#145;people's budget&#146;. Personally sanguine about how the increased taxes would reduce his own wealth, his chief objection was to the government's transparent attempt to circumvent House of Lords power. After the Unionist defeat at the general election of January 1910 had created the prospect of legislation to limit the Lords' power, Salisbury's constitutional concerns became paramount. Seeking to defeat what he regarded as an attempt to erect single-chamber government, he paradoxically became an advocate of constitutional innovations. He supported proposed modifications in the composition of the House of Lords as a means to preserve its authority, and with his brother-in-law Lord Selborne, with whom he now began a close alliance in the House of Lords and in church affairs, he adopted the idea of a popular referendum as a further check on radical majorities in the House of Commons. As tariff reform had not secured election victory and so failed as a buttress for other Unionist purposes, Salisbury now pressed strongly for its abandonment and approved of Balfour's offer to submit it to a referendum. After the further general election defeat of December 1910, the Liberal introduction of the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span>, ending the House of Lords' veto on legislation, established a leading cause for the rest of Salisbury's life: House of Lords reform. During July 1911 he was among the shadow cabinet rebels who repudiated Balfour's and Lansdowne's advice to abstain on the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span>, and with Selborne he rallied the &#145;die-hard&#146; Unionist peers who unsuccessfully voted against the bill. Afterwards, however, he sought restored party unity for the fight against further constitutional changes, and declined to join the organization of die-hard peers and MPs, the &#145;Halsbury Club&#146;. Following Balfour's replacement as party leader by Bonar Law, Salisbury was a major figure in the prolonged House of Lords opposition to both the <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span> and the <span class="roman">Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill</span>.<h2>
<a name="FirstWorldWar"></a>First World War</h2>On the outbreak of the First World War, Salisbury mobilized his Bedfordshire battalion for war service, and later at Kitchener's request took command of training a Territorial Army division, with the rank of major-general. He made Hatfield House Park available for secret trials of the original army tank, and chaired an advisory committee of the captain-general's office, supplying chaplains to the army. From June 1916 to September 1917 he chaired the central tribunal dealing with conscientious objectors' appeals for exemption from military service. On the creation of the Lloyd George coalition government in December 1916 Salisbury was offered the leadership of the House of Lords. He declined, however, ostensibly because he would have no cabinet or departmental position, but also because he retained his pre-war distrust of Lloyd George&#151;&#145;a windbag and a liar&#146;. Instead, in June 1917 he succeeded Carson as chairman of the Unionist war committee, which expressed the independent views of back-bench Unionist peers and MPs, and made representations to ministers across a range of policies. Already made a GCVO in 1909, he was made KG in 1917.<br>
<br>Salisbury was active in several aspects of post-war reconstruction. He led Unionist peers in calling for enfranchisement of all soldiers on active service, but resigned from the speaker's conference on electoral reform in December 1916 when more radical changes were proposed. He chaired the Ministry of Reconstruction's advisory housing panel, which momentously recommended in August 1917  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1918, 26, Cmd 9087) that in order to remedy the war-induced shortage of houses the state and local authorities should take responsibility for building working-class houses&#151;the origin of the <span class="roman">Addison Housing Act</span> (1919). He also chaired from 1917 to 1919 the ministry's advisory committee on the post-war disposal of surplus government property, and in early 1920 a committee which recommended  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1920, 18, Cmd 658) a three-year extension of wartime rent control.<br>
<br>Salisbury was also important in reform of the Church of England's organization and constitutional position, following the report in 1916 of the archbishops' committee on church and state chaired by Selborne. He helped manage the parliamentary passage of the 1919 <span class="roman">Enabling Act</span>, which created an elected national assembly of the church with independent legislative powers. Salisbury was a member of the national assembly's house of laymen from its inception in 1920 until 1945, and served on its original standing committee. With Selborne chairing the house of laymen, and with Lord Hugh Cecil and Selborne's son Lord Wolmer and son-in-law the fifth Earl Grey as further leading members, the lay leadership of the church was substantially in Cecilian hands for the next twenty years.<h2>
<a name="CriticoftheLloydGeorgecoalition"></a>Critic of the Lloyd George coalition</h2>During 1919 Salisbury declined invitations to chair the Church of England's central board of finance, and to become the British ambassador to the United States. He did so because he was increasingly concerned to prevent the Unionist Party's identity from being dissolved by its peacetime participation in the Lloyd George coalition government. In Salisbury's view Lloyd George and other Coalition Liberal ministers were not just indifferent or hostile to Unionist principles; they were also amoral, opportunistic, and a corrupting influence on their Unionist ministerial colleagues and on public life generally. He believed that the government was likely to alienate solid middle-class Unionist supporters, to create disillusion with existing institutions among new working-class voters, and to heighten class tension and strengthen the Labour Party and socialism.<br>
<br>Salisbury's preoccupation with public standards dated from pre-war Unionist campaigns against supposed misdemeanours under Asquith's Liberal cabinet, notably Lloyd George's entanglement in the Marconi scandal. In 1917 and 1918 he and Selborne publicly raised the issues of the proliferation and sale of honours and the appointment of newspaper owners to government posts. To them the &#145;honours scandal&#146; of 1922, during which they helped force an inquiry, was a vindication. In August 1919 they opposed the archbishops as well as the government over a compromise settlement on disendowment of the Welsh church. They criticized concessions toward Indian and Irish nationalists, and were appalled when the Irish treaty of 1921 ended the Irish union. They criticized the levels of government expenditure&#151;ironically, given Salisbury's wartime contributions to housing policy. They were also annoyed by the Unionist ministers' delay in proceeding with House of Lords reform, and the failure of their eventual bill in 1922.<br>
<br>Salisbury's vigilance over the coalition government was conducted through several channels. In March 1919 he and Selborne formed an association of independent Unionist peers. Sitting on the opposition benches in the House of Lords, they engaged in relentless verbal battles with Birkenhead, the lord chancellor, who later retaliated by satirizing them as &#145;the Dolly sisters&#146;, after the music-hall comediennes. Until March 1920 Salisbury remained chairman of the Unionist war committee's successors, the Unionist reconstruction committee and the Unionist parliamentary committee. In July 1920 he helped organize the People's Union for Economy, intended as a respectable alternative to Rothermere's Anti-Waste League. He also refined the art of using letters to newspapers as manifestos. In January 1920 he attacked the coalition's lack of principles, and from March began supporting Unionist candidates standing in by-elections against Coalition Liberals. Initially aiming only to preserve an independent unionism, in June 1921 he finally called upon all Unionist associations to support the replacement of the coalition government by a purely Unionist government.<br>
<br>Success came slowly, but Salisbury made a large contribution to the fall of the coalition government and the overthrow of the new Unionist Party leader, Austen Chamberlain. Although he disliked the fanaticism of the post-war breed of &#145;die-hard&#146; MPs, Salisbury welcomed them as useful allies. In March 1922 he joined their leaders in a &#145;statement of conservative and unionist principles&#146;&#151;the &#145;die-hard manifesto&#146;&#151;and in July was elected leader of &#145;the conservative and unionist movement&#146;. His real impact, however, lay less through these &#145;die-hards&#146; than in his own authority as a highly respected public figure and embodiment of a central Conservative tradition, able to confer confidence upon diverse groups of Unionist dissidents and to cast doubt among coalition supporters. As he helped encourage a groundswell of constituency and back-bench discontent during 1922, so the coalition itself fragmented. Salisbury held a meeting in his Arlington Street house to steel dissident MPs before the decisive party meeting at the Carlton Club on 19 October 1922. His pivotal importance was indicated the following day, after the coalition cabinet's resignation, as a member of the deputation which asked Bonar Law to accept nomination as the Unionist Party leader.<h2>
<a name="OfficeunderBonarLawandBaldwin"></a>Office under Bonar Law and Baldwin</h2>With the re-establishment of Unionist government Salisbury withdrew from his die-hard associations and rejoined the party leadership, as lord president of the council, deputy leader of the House of Lords, and, until May 1923, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. His brother Lord Robert Cecil was a cabinet colleague. Salisbury's main work was as chairman from March 1923 of a committee of imperial defence (CID) sub-committee appointed to consider the co-ordination of national and imperial defence. Its report, completed in August and published in 1924 (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1924, 10, Cmd 2029), led to the creation of the chiefs-of-staff committee&#151;vital in defence planning during the 1930s and in supervising British forces during the Second World War. The sub-committee also recommended an enlarged RAF as the vital defence force, and decided that the Fleet Air Arm should remain under RAF rather than Admiralty control. On Bonar Law's retirement in May 1923 Salisbury was asked to advise the king on his successor. He recommended Curzon, but was nevertheless content to serve under Baldwin's premiership. Difficulties arose, however, when in October Baldwin decided to call a general election on the issue of tariffs. As in the 1900s Salisbury thought the adoption of protection perverse, needlessly exposing fundamental public and Unionist Party interests to a large electoral risk, and probably to a further socialist advance. He was also offended by Baldwin's reluctance to take himself and other ministers into his confidence, and by his apparent readiness to replace them with the former Unionist coalition leaders, Austen Chamberlain and, shockingly, Birkenhead, whom Salisbury considered &#145;disreputable&#146;. Salisbury, Cecil and the other so-called &#145;free trade&#146; ministers came close to resignation, but allowed themselves to be persuaded by Baldwin that the cabinet had to keep together.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the general election in December 1923, which, as he had feared, led in January 1924 to the formation of a Labour government, Salisbury reluctantly acquiesced in reunion with Chamberlain, Birkenhead, and the other Unionist coalitionists. He was now conscious of a new need: to offer a positive contrast to socialism, appealing to the idealism of new voters and distinguishing Conservatism from any &#145;hard-shelled defence of the Haves against the Have-nots&#146;. In two statements&#151;&#145;Conservative policy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 and 19 March 1924) and &#145;An outline of Christian anti-socialism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century and After</span>, 97, 1925)&#151;Salisbury presented the Conservatives as the truly national party, concerned with all classes, seeking mutual trust in industry, and promoting the values of service and self-sacrifice.<br>
<br>In Baldwin's second government, from November 1924 to June 1929, Salisbury was lord privy seal and, after Curzon's death in April 1925, leader of the House of Lords. He chaired or served on numerous committees of the cabinet, CID, and Committee of Civil Research, on pensions, expenditure, imperial affairs, coal, and Ireland, though his visceral unionism baulked against signing the 1925 settlement on the Northern Irish boundary. Now considered a defence expert, he often chaired CID meetings and committees on naval limitation, disarmament, and belligerent rights. In 1926 and 1927 he visited Canada and Australia to review arrangements for imperial defence. Although much involved in disarmament policies, he shared only some of his brother Robert's confidence in the League of Nations, and felt only personal rather than political regret when Robert resigned from the government in October 1927. He had his own doubts on other matters, however. He was dismayed by the cabinet's wavering commitment to strengthen the House of Lords, and its abandonment of its own reform bill in 1927. Although he admired Baldwin's work in elevating public thinking after the coalition years, he was uneasy about what he judged to be concessions towards Liberal or Labour thinking. His colleagues received painfully fastidious notes of qualification, as he sought to square their policies with his sensitive political conscience. They were, he thought, &#145;without ballast or tradition&#146;, and he wondered &#145;if any of them know why they are Conservatives&#146;  (Salisbury to Selborne, 18 March 1929, Selborne papers, 7/203&#150;5, Bodl. Oxf.).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, after the government defeat in the election of 1929 Salisbury continued as Conservative leader in the House of Lords. He persuaded Conservative peers to exercise restraint in dealing with Labour government measures, negotiating a compromise over the controversial <span class="roman">Coal Mines Bill</span> in early 1930. But he had growing reservations about the shadow cabinet's reversion to tariffs and acceptance of Indian constitutional reform, while remaining publicly loyal to Baldwin. When he retired from the collective leadership in June 1931 it was on the public grounds of ill health, though he privately noted to Baldwin that &#145;Alas, you and I do not belong to the same school of Conservatism&#146;  (Hatfield House archives).<h2>
<a name="IndependentpeerIndiaandMoralReArmament"></a>Independent peer: India and Moral Re-Armament</h2>Once his health was restored, however, Salisbury resumed an active political role, independent of the Conservative-dominated national coalition governments of the 1930s. By now he was the most respected and influential peer in the House of Lords, where a remarkable family group accumulated: three of his brothers, two sons-in-law, Selborne, and his own and Selborne's eldest sons, both elevated by special dispensation in 1941. In March 1932 Salisbury assembled an unofficial joint committee of Unionist peers and MPs on House of Lords reform. Its report in October proposed that the House of Lords should have powers to refer legislation to the verdict of a general election, and should be composed of members elected from among the hereditary peers and by county councils. Although it obtained substantial Conservative Party support, although Salisbury's bill containing its recommendations obtained a second House of Lords reading in May 1934, and although he continued to make representations to ministers for three more years, the government judged the scheme too divisive to be adopted. From late 1931 Salisbury again became allied with Conservative &#145;die-hards&#146;, now including Churchill, as a leading opponent of the government's policy of establishing native Indian responsibility in the central government of India. He felt deeply that this constituted an abdication of British moral obligations towards the Indian masses. Appointed by ministers in April 1933 to the joint select committee on their proposals in the hope of constraining his criticism, when the committee reported in November 1934 he led nine of its members in repudiating its principal recommendations. Defeated in the Conservative Party's central council in December, he persisted to the very end, breaching House of Lords conventions by opposing all three readings of the <span class="roman">Government of India Bill</span> during 1935. Salisbury was also associated with Churchill in directing attention to what they considered to be the inadequate rate of government rearmament against the military threat from Germany. In July and November 1936 he participated in deputations of privy councillors to express their disquiet to Baldwin and other ministers. During the abdication crisis, however, he advised and supported Baldwin, regretting Churchill's efforts to assist Edward VIII. At King George VI's coronation he was high steward, and bore St Edward's crown.<br>
<br>Salisbury was acutely anxious about the spiritual and ideological challenges of the 1930s: materialism, irreligion, communism, and fascism. Remarkably, this great upholder of establishment religion turned for an antidote to the unecclesiastical evangelism of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group, renamed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96078', "Moral Re-Armament")</script> in 1938. While doubtful about several of its practices and never himself an adherent, he was much impressed by its apparent success in stimulating Christian belief among the young of all classes and among influential persons in many countries. From 1935 he became the most prominent British figure prepared to support the group. In October 1936 he invited other leading public figures to meet Buchman at Hatfield House; and in the House of Lords, in letters to newspapers, and in representations to ministers and bishops he promoted its appeal for wholehearted acceptance of guidance from God. Salisbury defended the group against its many critics, and when in 1941 the cabinet upheld a Ministry of Labour ruling that its workers were not exempt from conscription, he initiated a House of Lords debate in protest, though without success.<h2>
<a name="AntiappeasementroleSecondWorldWaranddeath"></a>Anti-appeasement role, Second World War, and death</h2>Appalled during the late 1930s by the character and actions of the Nazi regime, Salisbury became increasingly critical of Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Germany, especially after his son Cranborne, under-secretary at the Foreign Office since 1935, followed Eden in resigning from the government in February 1938. He disliked the Munich agreement and, sceptical of the cabinet defence preparations, joined public appeals late in 1938 for the introduction of national service. After the outbreak of war in 1939 he called for the formation of an all-party national coalition and a small war cabinet. Troubled by the apparent military inertia of the following months, he formed in April 1940 a secret group of non-ministerial peers and MPs, including Lord Cecil, Cranborne, and Wolmer, to act as a &#145;watching committee&#146;. Its criticisms of the direction of the war meant that Salisbury was soon doing to Neville Chamberlain what he had done to Austen Chamberlain in 1922&#151;contributing to the destruction of his leadership. During the political crisis of May he made representations to ministers on reconstruction of the government, and Churchill on becoming prime minister considered making him leader of the House of Lords. The watching committee remained in existence for the rest of the war, raising significant issues, on occasion criticizing Churchill's management of the war effort, and making proposals for reconstruction. In 1942 Salisbury published <span class="italic">Post-War Conservative Policy</span>, a pamphlet which recognized the inevitability of larger government, but argued the cases for individual freedom, private property, religious education, and a reformed House of Lords.<br>
<br>Salisbury was<blockquote>about five feet eight inches in height, clean shaved with moustache, well proportioned, and handsome in appearance. In London he was always immaculately dressed in the frock coat and top hat which had been <i>de rigueur</i> in his youth and which he was one of the last to wear. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>A long career as party grandee was formally recognized in his presidency of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations from 1942 to 1945. His last letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1946 was on House of Lords reform. His last major House of Lords speech, in February 1947, was a protest against British abandonment of the care of 50 million Indian &#145;untouchables&#146;. His last public act was to lead a deputation to the archbishop of Canterbury calling for church union and a stand against post-war materialism and irreligion. He collapsed during the meeting and died a week later, at 25 Westminster Gardens, London, on 4 April 1947. He was buried in the family graveyard of St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield. A bust of him was placed in the House of Lords &#145;by peers of all Parties in token of their affection and esteem&#146;.<br>
