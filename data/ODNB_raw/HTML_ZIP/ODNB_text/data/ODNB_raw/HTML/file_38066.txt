<span class="headword">Thoroughgood, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1594?, <em>d.</em> 1675), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was the second son in the family of seven sons and a daughter of William Thorowgood (<i>d</i>. 1625) of Grimston, Norfolk, and Anne, his first wife, the daughter of Henry Edwards of Norwich, gentleman. He was probably the son of that name whom they baptized on 4 May 1594. His father, who belonged to an armigerous family in Felsted, Essex, had served as commissary to Edmund Scambler, bishop of Norwich, and continued his career as ecclesiastical administrator until his death. It seems reasonable to suppose that John was born and spent his early years in Grimston, Norfolk, where his family was recorded as having an estate in 1664, but there is no record of his educational background.<br>
<br>By 1633 Thoroughgood was already moving in court circles. He went to Scotland as a gentleman pensioner to King Charles I in that year and was knighted by the king. In the civil war he sided with parliament, though the strength of his commitment is unclear. By now resident in fashionable Kensington, he was appointed to the Middlesex militia committee in 1644 and to both the Middlesex and the Norfolk militia committees in 1648. He was an assessment commissioner for Westminster and Middlesex in 1649, and in the 1650s he held a number of minor central and local offices and was a commissioner of oyer and terminer.<br>
<br>Thoroughgood's most important position was as one of the trustees for the maintenance of ministers, appointed in 1649 to supplement the work of the parliamentary plundered ministers' committee by augmenting the stipends of clergy and teachers out of funds at their disposal. He was active, usually as senior trustee, until 1660. Nevertheless no measures were taken against him at the Restoration, suggesting perhaps that he had not been a republican by choice and may have worked towards the return of Charles II. He was even appointed honorary gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles II. His moralizing work, <span class="italic">The King of Terrors Silenced, by Meditations and Examples of Holy Living and Holy Dying</span> (1664), reveals an orthodox Calvinism, but neither this nor his will gives any hint of Puritan enthusiasm, despite their author's central role in the administration of the interregnum church.<br>
<br>Thoroughgood married Frances, daughter of Thomas Meautys (1590&#150;1649) of West Ham, Essex, clerk to the privy council and MP. She died childless when still a minor in 1651 and he never remarried. He died at some point between 12 November 1675, when he signed his will, and 5 December 1675 when the will was proved; he asked to be buried next to his wife in the church of High Ongar, Essex. With no direct heirs he made elaborate provisions in his will to prevent legal disputes between his nephews; the bulk of his estate, including a manor in Bagthorp, Essex, which he was in the process of buying at the time of writing his will, was left to Robert Thoroughgood, the son of his brother Robert.<br>
