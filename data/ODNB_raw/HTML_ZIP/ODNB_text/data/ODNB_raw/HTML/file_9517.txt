<span class="headword">Fitch,  William Stevenson</span>  (1792&#150;1859), <span class="occ">antiquary and thief</span>, was born at Ipswich on 17 November 1792, the eldest of the five children of Samuel Fitch, druggist, and his wife, Elizabeth Stevenson. After five years at Ipswich grammar school (1802&#150;7) he joined the family business and later took over the shop on his father's death in 1815. An early and consuming fascination with old documents, autographs, prints, and coins, particularly those relating to Suffolk history, brought him into contact with other East Anglian antiquaries and collectors, most importantly Dawson Turner of Yarmouth, with whom he corresponded over three decades and to whom he presented and sold many important manuscripts.<br>
<br>By 12 July 1824 Fitch had secretly married Rachel Alexander, a gamekeeper's daughter whom he described to Turner as having been brought up and educated by Wilbraham Tollemache, sixth earl of Dysart; at the time of the marriage Rachel was responsible for the running of Ham House, Surrey, the principal home of the earl's sister and heir, Louisa, seventh countess. Both Ham House (first visited by Fitch in 1821) and Helmingham Hall, the Tollemache family property near Ipswich, were possessed of important archival libraries, to which Fitch gained intimate access and from which he appropriated, apparently without the knowledge of the aged countess, a large quantity of manuscript and early printed material.<br>
<br>From Ham House Fitch abstracted a portion of the papers of John Maitland, first duke of Lauderdale and second husband of an earlier countess of Dysart, to whom the Lauderdale papers had descended in 1682. Fitch's spoils included some of Lauderdale's own correspondence, as well as an important collection of primary documents from the time of Mary Stuart, many of them associated with Mary's secretary William Maitland of Lethington. In 1833 he arranged for the printing of thirty copies of &#145;Maitland's narrative of the principal acts of the regency during the minority, and other papers relating to the history of Mary queen of Scotland&#146;, dedicated to Dawson Turner. Some of the original manuscripts themselves later passed to Turner, who cannot have been unaware of their provenance; in 1859 many were purchased for the British Museum at Turner's posthumous sale. Fitch also plundered the Helmingham Hall library, where in the eighteenth century the third and fourth earls of Dysart had added substantially to the collection formed by Sir Lionel Tollemache, first baronet, around 1600. By 1832 he had sold (for a pittance) the Helmingham collection of about 160 early broadside ballads to the London collector George Daniel, who ceded approximately half to Richard Heber; Daniel's retained moiety passed eventually, through Henry and Alfred Henry Huth, to the British Museum, and Heber's to Britwell Court and the Henry E. Huntington Library. Other Helmingham &#145;finds&#146;, such as the manuscript of Alexander Nowell's large catechism, went to Dawson Turner, and still others directly to the British Museum; the only extant poetical holograph of George Peele, his &#145;Anglorum feriae&#146;, which Fitch published in 1835, may stem from Helmingham or Ham House as well.<br>
<br>Also in 1832 Fitch sold to the sixth duke of Devonshire the manuscript of John Bale's morality play <span class="italic">King Johan</span>; the sale was negotiated by Turner, to whom Fitch explained that the manuscript had come from the Ipswich corporation chest, but had been considered &#145;useless lumber&#146;. Other early documents deriving from the Ipswich muniments were listed by Fitch in a privately printed catalogue (1843) and appeared in the three auction sales of his collections held in 1855 and 1859, when some were claimed by town authorities and withdrawn.<br>
<br>Despite the irregularity of his activities, and the almost certain knowledge of them among contemporaries such as Turner, Hudson Gurney, and Sir Frederic Madden, Fitch was respected in his time for his knowledge of Suffolk antiquities and was an active member of both the British Archaeological Association and the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology. In 1837 he was appointed postmaster of Ipswich, a post which he held until 1859. He died on 17 July 1859 at Ipswich, where he was buried three days later, survived by his wife, two of his three sons, and a daughter, all of whom emigrated (to America and New Zealand) by 1868. His widow died on 14 January 1870 at Troy, New York state.<br>
