<span class="headword">Pennefather,  Richard</span>  (1772&#150;1859), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born into a well-known Irish protestant family at Knockevan, co. Tipperary, on 25 August 1772. He was the eldest son of Major William Pennefather (1732&#150;1819), of Darling-Hill, co. Tipperary, MP for Cashel, and Ellen, eldest daughter of Edward Moore DD, archdeacon of Emly. Like his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21864/', "Edward Pennefather")</script>, he was educated at Portarlington and Clonmel schools, and he graduated BA at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1794, after a distinguished career there. He had entered the Middle Temple in London in 1792, and was called to the Irish bar in 1795.<br>
<br>About ten years later Pennefather enjoyed a reputation both on the Munster circuit and as a junior in the court of chancery. He appears as king's counsel in 1816, but was seldom employed as leading counsel, being overshadowed by William Plunket and William Saurin. In 1798 he married Jane, daughter of Mr Justice John Bennett of Dublin. They had eight children (of whom at least two predeceased their father); the civil servant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21866/', "Richard Pennefather")</script> was one of the sons.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1821 Pennefather was appointed a baron of the Irish exchequer court, and he sat on the bench for thirty-eight years. He was a sound, able, and honourable judge, skilled in the digestion and elucidation of evidence, courteous in his bearing, and in criminal cases lenient. In his final years Pennefather lost his sight and this, coupled with his age (he being at the time over eighty) led to suggestions in the Commons that he be removed from the bench. Such suggestions were not favourably received, and the house united in paying tribute to the man: the Conservatives likened him to Lord Lyndhurst, and the Liberals admitted unreservedly his exceptional judicial gifts and undiminished popularity. So it was of his own accord that Pennefather retired, some three years later, in 1859. He died suddenly at his residence in Kiltegan, near Clonmel, co. Tipperary, on 7 August 1859, and was buried at Caher, co. Tipperary.<br>
