<span class="headword">Kimber,  Edward</span>  (1719&#150;1769), <span class="occ">journal editor and writer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15548/', "Isaac Kimber (1692&#150;1755)")</script>, a General Baptist minister. There is no evidence that Kimber had any formal education. However, it is likely that he gained editorial experience and training as a youth after his father took up the editorship of the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> in 1732  (Hayes, 11). In September 1742 Kimber left England for the American colonies, where he spent two years travelling. He recorded his observations on his travels in America, which were later published and would be reflected in his novels. Kimber returned to England in July 1744 and shortly thereafter married Susanna Anne Lunn, of East Kiel, with whom he had two sons, Edward and Richard, and one daughter, Margaretta Maria, who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Kimber worked on a wide range of literary projects and was extremely prolific. He began contributing poetry to the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> in 1734, ultimately taking over its editorship in 1755. A significant portion of his travel writing was also printed in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>. Much of his work, however, was published anonymously or pseudonymously. Kimber later explicitly identified himself as the author of numerous poems and essays in his <span class="italic">General Index to &hellip; the &#145;London Magazine&#146;</span> (1760). He also compiled an index for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1754) and contributed to the <span class="italic">Universal Magazine</span> (1750) and to the <span class="italic">Westminster Journal</span> (1751).<br>
<br>Kimber's seven novels, all anonymously published, enjoyed considerable success in the eighteenth century. Almost all of them went through two editions. His most famous novel, <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Joe Thompson</span> (1750), went through six editions, was translated into French (1762) and German (1765), and was abridged for children by Richard Johnson, with whom he revised Thomas Wotton's <span class="italic">Baronetage</span>, in 1788. In 1759 he published a translation of C. P. J. de Crebillon's novel, <span class="italic">Heureux orphelins</span>. Kimber also made indexes for law books and histories, wrote manuals, and compiled several peerages. He has also been credited with <span class="italic">The Ladies Complete Letter-Writer</span> (1763). He died in 1769, &#145;a victim, in the Meridian of his Life, to his indefatigable Toils in the Republic of Letters&#146;  (Johnson, viii).<br>
