<span class="headword">Thirlby,  Styan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1691, <em>d.</em> 1753), <span class="occ">textual critic and theologian</span>, was baptized on 7 January 1691 at St Margaret's, Leicester, the son of Thomas Thirlby (<i>d</i>. 1701), vicar of St Margaret's, Leicester, and his wife, Mary (1663&#150;1723), eldest daughter of Henry Styan of Kirby Frith. He was educated at the Leicester Free School, where, according to the head usher, the Revd John Kilby, &#145;his self-conceit was censured as very offensive.&#151;He thought he knew more than all the school&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.264). He was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge, as a sizar on 10 April 1707 and graduated BA in 1710/11.<br>
<br>In 1710 Thirlby engaged in controversy, publishing <span class="italic">The University of Cambridge vindicated from the imputation of disloyalty &hellip; also, from the malicious and foul aspersions of Dr. B&#151;ly, late master of Trinity College</span>, a &#145;violent and intemperate pamphlet&#146; in which he &#145;abuses Bentley without measure or decency&#146;  (Monk, 1.289). This was followed by involvement in the renewed Arian controversy in <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr. Whiston's Seventeen Suspicions Concerning Athanasius</span> (1712), a work generally considered (according to a correspondent of Dr Charles Ashton, the master of Jesus College) to be beyond the powers of such a young man in its knowledge of ecclesiastical history and of the church fathers, and leading Ashton's correspondent (&#145;A. M.&#146;) to declare Thirlby &#145;the greatest Young Man that has appeard these many years&#146;  (Smith, 222). On 16 October 1712 he was elected to a fellowship at Jesus, taking his MA in 1714.<br>
<br>Thirlby settled into the life of a fellow, and<blockquote>From his mental abilities no small degree of future eminence was presaged; but the fond hopes of his friends were unfortunately defeated, by a temper which was naturally indolent and quarrelsome, and by an unhappy addiction to drinking &hellip; being sometimes in a state of intoxication for five or six weeks together. (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.264, 267)</blockquote>He did, however, continue his studies in divinity and published what was to be his <i>magnum opus</i>, a folio edition of Saint Justin Martyr's <span class="italic">Apologiae duae et dialogus cum Tryphone Judaeo cum notis et emendationibus</span> (1722), with the Greek text and a Latin translation in parallel columns. In his preface he again attacks Bentley &#145;in so extravagant a style that he makes the reader, at the very outset of his work, doubt whether the editor was in a sane mind&#146;  (Monk, 2.167). His performance cost him the support of Ashton.<br>
<br>From study of divinity Thirlby proceeded to medicine, becoming (in Johnson's phrase) &#145;a nominal physician&#146;; he also lived briefly with the duke of Chandos, serving as librarian, but &#145;is reported to have affected a perverse and insolent independence, so as capriciously to refuse his company when it was desired&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.266). He then took up civil law, obtaining an LLD in 1728, and gave sporadic lectures, having Sir Edward Walpole as one of his students. This acquaintance led to a lifelong friendship and his moving to London, living in Walpole's house for a period. In May 1741 Walpole also procured him a sinecure as king's waiter in the Port of London custom house, worth about &pound;100 a year, after which he lived in lodgings.<br>
<br>From his undergraduate years Thirlby was interested in the text of Shakespeare. He bought editions of Shakespeare from Nicholas Rowe (1709) to William Warburton (1747), making extensive marginalia, most of which are acute, some intemperate. Warburton's reference in his preface to <span class="italic">Shakespear</span> (1747) to (unpublished) letters from Pope urging him to edit Shakespeare  (1.xix n.) produced: &#145;You might as well have said See my arse in a band box&#146;  (Folger Shakespeare Library, PR 2752 1747a c. 2). Theobald visited him in Cambridge early in 1729; their conversation included speculation about Shakespeare's &#145;foul papers&#146; being manuscript copy for certain plays, as appears from Theobald's recognition, after Thirlby, that a passage in <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span> (V. ii. 817&#150;22) is Shakespeare's first draft of matter that receives its final version later in the scene (ll. 837&#150;54)  (Seary, 144). Thirlby also gave Theobald &#145;the Liberty of collating his Copy of <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>, mark'd thro' in the Margin with his own Manuscript References and accurate Observations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of William Shakespeare</span>, ed. Theobald, 1.lxv) and sent him (7 May 1729) a list of seventy proposed emendations, not all of which were accepted  (Folger, MS W.b. 74, fols. 65<i>r</i>&#150;67<i>v</i>). In his edition, Theobald has fifty-two references to Thirlby. Johnson also had access to Thirlby's marginalia in Warburton's <span class="italic">Shakespear</span> (1747), when preparing his <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> (1765), and has forty-two citations. Thirlby never published his own projected edition of Shakespeare &#145;and consequently exerted only a dislocated subterranean influence upon the editorial tradition, as his orphaned conjectures were adopted (often without acknowledgement) by others&#146;  (Taylor, 54).<br>
<br>Thirlby died unmarried in London on 19 December 1753, leaving a simple will (11 January 1751): &#145;I give all I have to the Hon<sup>ble</sup> M<sup>r</sup>. Edw<sup>d</sup>. Walpole to do all I can to enable him to pay himself what I owe him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/807). Probably his legacy consisted of books.<br>
