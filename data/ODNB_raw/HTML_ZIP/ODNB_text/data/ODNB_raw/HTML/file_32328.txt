<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Catto,  Thomas Sivewright</span>, first Baron Catto  (1879&#150;1959), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne on 15 March 1879, the fifth son and seventh child of William Catto (1835&#150;1885), shipwright, of Peterhead, and his wife, Isabella, daughter of William Yule, sea captain. His father had moved to Tyneside with his family in search of steadier employment, but died within a year, and the family returned to Peterhead. Catto attended Peterhead Academy, but after a move back to Newcastle he won a scholarship to Heaton School (now Rutherford College). Catto's formal education ended at the pre-university stage, though in 1945 he was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Manchester. Catto married in 1910, at Smyrna, Gladys Forbes, daughter of Stephen Gordon, a partner in MacAndrews and Forbes there and a native of Elgin in Moray. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76231/', "Stephen Gordon Catto (1923&#150;2001)")</script>, a partner in Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co., who succeeded to the title. They also had three daughters, the eldest of whom, Isabel, was elected president of the World YWCA in 1955.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerinshipping"></a>Early career in shipping</h2>Catto's career began at the age of fifteen, when he entered the office of the Gordon Steam Shipping Company. Although by 1898 his wages had risen from 4<i>s</i>. to 10<i>s</i>. a week, Catto sought wider opportunities; through a newspaper advertisement he applied for, and obtained, the post of secretary to W. H. Stuart, managing partner of F. A. Mattievich &amp; Co. of Batumi, at a salary of &pound;8 a month. He sailed from Cardiff, barely nineteen, with a small trunk, a bicycle, and &pound;3 in cash. For six years he worked in Batumi and Baku, learned to speak Russian, and on his twenty-first birthday was made office manager. While working for Stuart, Catto met Vivian Hugh Smith (1867&#150;1956), later Lord Bicester, who was to have an important influence on his subsequent career.<br>
<br>Among other friends made in Baku was David Forbes junior, a Scottish merchant, whose business was soon to be absorbed in MacAndrews and Forbes, Russian and Near Eastern merchants with headquarters in the United States. In 1904 Catto was offered the management of their new European selling agency and, with Stuart's goodwill, found himself organizing an office in London. He became a member of the Baltic Exchange and learned London ways of merchanting and the chartering of ships; but after two years he returned to the Near East as second-in-command to Forbes in Smyrna, a post entailing much travel in the Near and Middle East. In 1909 he was transferred to the New York office, becoming a vice-president. The United States was to provide his home base for the next eleven years.<h2>
<a name="FirstWorldWarandIndia"></a>First World War and India</h2>When war broke out in August 1914, Catto was in England. His lack of inches prevented military service, but on the introduction of Vivian Smith he was employed in the organization of transporting supplies to Russia, and the same connection led to his becoming the British Admiralty representative on the Russian commission to the United States from 1915 to 1917. When Russia collapsed, he transferred to the British food mission in the United States, and in 1918 he became chairman of the allied provisions commission and head of the British Ministry of Food in the USA and Canada. In recognition of his war-time service, in 1918 he was appointed CBE, in 1919 a commander of the order of Leopold of Belgium, and in 1921 he received a baronetcy.<br>
<br>Catto never returned, as he had intended, to MacAndrews and Forbes. In 1917 Vivian Smith's firm, Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co., had acquired a predominating share in Andrew Yule &amp; Co. of Calcutta and its associated business, George Yule &amp; Co. of London, the great Indian commercial empire built by Sir David Yule, whom Catto was invited to succeed. With a young family, Catto had no mind to take up residence in India, but what decided him was that his mother's name was Yule (though no relationship was ever established). The position of head of Andrew Yule &amp; Co., which he assumed in 1919, led to Catto's playing an active part in financial and economic affairs in India: he became president of the Bengal chamber of commerce, and served as a member of the Inchcape committee on Indian government retrenchment in 1922&#150;3. Closer to home, he also served on the United Kingdom committee on coal-selling in 1926. In 1928 he became a partner in Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co., and retired from India. He remained chairman of Andrew Yule &amp; Co., and of the London business, which became Yule, Catto &amp; Co., until 1940.<h2>
<a name="BankinginLondon"></a>Banking in London</h2>Established in London, Catto became a director of the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation, the Mercantile Bank of India, the Tobacco Securities Trust Company Ltd, the Union Castle Mail Steamship Company Ltd, the Oriental Telephone and Electric Company Ltd, and the Royal Bank of Scotland. One other task he undertook in the 1930s was to act with Sir Ernest Harvey (deputy governor of the Bank of England) in reordering the affairs of the Royal Mail and the Elder Dempster shipping companies, an unpaid post to which he was drafted by Montagu Norman (1871&#150;1950), the governor of the Bank of England. On 24 February 1936 he was created a baron, taking his territorial title from Cairncatto, a farm which he had purchased in Buchan, Aberdeenshire, whence his forebears had come.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1940 Catto became a director of the Bank of England, and until July 1941 he served on the bank's advances and discounts committee, staff committee, and securities committee, and paid supervisory visits to the bank's branch in Newcastle. These were, however, secondary activities, because, only a fortnight after his appointment as a director of the bank, Catto succeeded Lord Woolton as director-general of equipment and stores at the Ministry of Supply. In July 1941 he resigned his directorship of the bank and moved to the newly created post of financial adviser to the Treasury. Catto thus joined the influx of outside experts assembled to assist the Treasury war effort, working alongside, among others, John Maynard Keynes. In this context, Catto represented commercial and banking experience, the kind of practical man of business Keynes had once scorned; he and Keynes, hitherto strangers, held widely contrasting economic views, but developed a strong mutual respect, and also friendship, and eventually became known to the press as lords &#145;Catto and Doggo&#146;.<h2>
<a name="GovernoroftheBankofEngland19441949"></a>Governor of the Bank of England, 1944&#150;1949</h2>By the close of 1943 it had become evident that illness was about to end Montagu Norman's long reign at the Bank of England. In April 1944 Catto, then sixty-five, was chosen as Norman's successor and, having been released from his position at the Treasury, was elected on 18 April to the governorship in a brief ceremony held in Norman's room at the bank. Catto was in many respects well equipped by his merchant banking knowledge and by his recent experience in Whitehall to oversee the middle position which the bank occupied between government and the City, but he faced some important difficulties. Following Norman was in itself a problem, for the great man had occupied the governorship for twenty-four years and, during that time, had transformed the organization and outlook of the bank and had come to be regarded as the perfect partner for the &#145;Old Lady&#146;. Moreover, in spite of his City background, Catto was initially regarded with some suspicion by senior bank staff, who felt that he had become too much a Treasury man. Most important, however, was the fact that Catto's tenure of the governorship coincided with the end of the war, the problems of domestic and international reconstruction, and the nationalization of the bank.<br>
<br>In dealing with these problems, Catto relied for the most part on the team that he inherited from Norman, which reassured those who had viewed him as a Treasury &#145;new broom&#146;. In his first year he occupied himself with the main questions likely to arise in the post-war period, notably in the field of industrial finance, where he was much concerned with the establishment of the Finance Corporation for Industry and the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation&#151;institutions designed to meet inter-war criticisms of the City's neglect of British industry. But he had been in office little more than a year when a Labour government was returned, pledged to an early nationalization of the Bank of England and ready to introduce new measures of control over the banking system as a whole; and it is with these questions that his name as governor is principally associated.<br>
<br>Catto accepted that the bank had already been converted, <i>de facto</i>, into a public institution, aligning its monetary policy with the general economic policy of the government of the day, and no longer seeking to provide for its stockholders more than a constant dividend. Accordingly he took the view that there was nothing in the proposal for public ownership which need diminish the utility or standing of the bank, provided its independence in thought and work was fully safeguarded. Similarly, he did not oppose the provision of a new measure of control over the banking system, provided that it was general in character and operated on the initiative of the bank. Catto's protracted negotiations with Hugh Dalton, the Labour chancellor at the time of the bank's nationalization, bear ample testimony to the tenacity with which he sought to achieve these ends.<br>
<br>Catto judged correctly that he could best defend the bank's own position, and that of the banking world more generally, by not actively opposing the general policy of nationalization. As a result the bank was taken into public ownership with the minimum public controversy and the maximum retention of operational independence. Catto's own speeches in the House of Lords were important here, for they established some of the principles for future interpretations of the legal intention of the nationalization statute. His successor, Lord Cobbold, instructed bank staff to read these speeches as the best indications of the bank's position, and in the 1950s the Treasury solicitors accepted their significance when they undertook a detailed examination of the constraints on the government's limited powers over the bank. Catto was appointed as the first governor of the publicly owned bank in March 1946, and on 25 July 1947, midway through his term of office, he was sworn of the privy council. In his last years as governor Catto divided his time equally between consolidating the bank's new domestic role and involvement in the financial aspects of international post-war reconstruction; in the latter context he played a significant part in discussions on the role of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank). He resigned the governorship on 28 February 1949, two weeks before his seventieth birthday&#151;by that time the statutory age limit for the office.<h2>
<a name="Retirementreputationanddeath"></a>Retirement, reputation, and death</h2>In retirement, Catto served as chairman, in 1950&#150;52, of a committee to report on the practicability of determining the financial and economic relations between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Scottish matters indeed, and particularly those of the county of Aberdeen, were a lifelong concern. In addition to the farm of Cairncatto, he had bought the nearby Schivas House, Ythanbank, which he restored fully on his return from India. In August 1957 he became the first freeman of Peterhead, an honour which gave him particular pleasure.<br>
<br>In appearance Catto was short of stature, with a fresh complexion and clear blue eyes. His open countenance and quiet manner perhaps tended to conceal his shrewdness and skill as a negotiator, so well displayed while he was governor of the bank. If there was occasion for controversy he avoided a head-on collision, and used his judgement to carry his objective without sacrificing any point of importance. As the head of a large organization he imposed his will with courtesy and with sensitivity towards his subordinates.<br>
<br>Catto's career formed a bridge between the pre-1914 world, in which informal business contacts and the presence of individual merchant companies, especially from Britain, were responsible for much of the world's commerce, and the post-1945 world, in which international financial institutions and conglomerates, and the emergence of world trading blocs, had become the engine of increasingly complex capital and trade flows and relationships. He was in the Middle East when the Baghdad to Berlin railway was projected, and when oil was discovered in Iran; he was still involved in business and economic development in the era of the International Monetary Fund, decolonization, and the emergence of the European Economic Community. Catto's business career is of intrinsic interest, but it is his period as governor of the bank that marks him out as a figure of historical importance. On a purely biographical level his ascent from humble Scots origins to the pinnacle of City, and ultimately national, financial rank is a story of great personal achievement. More broadly his brief period as governor of the bank witnessed a remarkable period of transition in international, national, and bank affairs.<br>
<br>Clement Attlee remarked with some justification on Catto's retirement that &#145;no governor has had to face such a difficult world situation&#146;  (Bank of England Archives, G 21) and Catto played a significant part in calming some of the turbulence which characterized post-war economic and financial reconstruction. But Catto's most important contribution to post-war history was his handling of the bank's nationalization. In the short term his adroit management of bank and City opinion indeed helped to ensure a minimum of public controversy. In the long term, however, his successful attempt to preserve much of the bank's independence was to prove crucial in shaping the future role of the financial sector and the governance of the post-war economy.<br>
<br>Catto suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in his sleep at his house, Holmdale, in Holmbury St Mary, Shere, Surrey, on 23 August 1959, at the age of eighty. A memorial service was held at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 23 October 1959.<br>
