<span class="headword">Buckland <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Morland]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1797&#150;1857), <span class="occ">geological artist and curator</span>, was born on 20 November 1797 in St Helen's parish, Abingdon, Berkshire, the eldest daughter of Benjamin Morland (1768&#150;1833), solicitor (and a member of the West Ilsley brewing family), and his wife, Harriet Baster (1777&#150;1799). Benjamin Morland was much involved in local politics and had made money during the Napoleonic wars. He was also involved in both canal promotions and Forest of Dean coalmines.<br>
<br>Mary Morland's mother died just over a year after her birth and it was her father who first aroused in her an interest in geology. She was educated in Southampton but also developed a close relationship with the childless regius professor of anatomy at Oxford, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21778/', "Sir Christopher Pegge (1764/5&#150;1822)")</script>, and spent some of her childhood with him and his wife in Oxford. Pegge had been an early advocate of the importance of teaching geology at Oxford, and had given a number of private lectures in mineralogy. His admiration of Mary Morland culminated in his bequest to her in 1822 of &#145;his mineral cabinets and all the minerals and fossils contained in them at the time of my decease and all my books of natural history and comparative anatomy as a mark of my esteem and regard for her&#146;  (will of Christopher Pegge).<br>
<br>On 31 December 1825, at Marcham, Berkshire, Mary Morland married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3859/', "William Buckland (1784&#150;1856)")</script>, professor of geology and mineralogy at Oxford University, who was thirteen years her senior. She clearly brought her own geological interests to this marriage, so the famous 1839 anecdote of their introduction&#151;in a Dorset coach discovering a mutual admiration for Georges Cuvier&#151;may have had some truth to it. Mary was certainly involved in independent geological investigations by 1819, when Buckland first mentions his extensive obligations to her and had been sending Georges Cuvier drawings of <i>Megalosaurus</i> (later published by William Buckland) from 1822.<br>
<br>Mary Buckland played a vital, if now forgotten, role in her husband's meteoric rise as geologist and founder of the Oxford school of geology. She accompanied him on a year-long wedding tour of the continent, and on their return she created a home for him in which the &#145;dust and rubbish [were] held sacred to geology&#146;  (Fox, 1.83). She corrected Buckland's fine prose and wrote much of it at his dictation. Her skill as an artist was also put to use in Buckland's wonderfully illustrated <span class="italic">Reliquiae diluvianae</span> (1823) and his <span class="roman">Bridgewater Treatise</span>, <span class="italic">Geology and Mineralogy</span> (1836). She was &#145;neat and clever in mending fossils&#146; with specially developed cements, in making models of them, and in assisting Buckland's experiments to reproduce fossil tracks&#151;all vital evidence for Buckland's science. She was Buckland's curator, and &#145;hardly a fossil or bone in the Oxford Museum &hellip; [had] not her handwriting upon it&#146;  (K&ouml;lbl-Ebert, 33).<br>
<br>Mary Buckland also played a vital role in the education of the five of her nine children who survived childhood; the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3857/', "Francis (Frank) Buckland (1826&#150;1880)")</script>, became a renowned naturalist. Worn out with caring for her husband, who had slipped into mental decline from about 1842 and had been placed in John Bush's Mental Asylum at Clapham in London in 1850, Mary Buckland died on 30 November 1857 at St Leonards, Sussex. She was buried at Islip, Oxfordshire.<br>
