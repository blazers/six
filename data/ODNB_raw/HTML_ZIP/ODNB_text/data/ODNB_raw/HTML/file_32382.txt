<span class="headword">Chatterjee, Sir  Atul Chandra</span>  (1874&#150;1955), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at Malda in Lower Bengal on 24 November 1874, the fourth son and sixth child of Rai Sahib Hem Chandra Chatterjee of Santipur, an engineer in the Bengal public works department, and his wife, Srimati Nistarini Debi. He was educated at Hare School, Calcutta, and Presidency College, Calcutta, where he graduated BA in 1892. In 1893 he was awarded a government of India scholarship and entered King's College, Cambridge, where he took a second class in history in 1895. The following year he headed the list of successful candidates in the open competition for the Indian Civil Service, and during his probationary year at Cambridge won the Bhaunagar medal.<br>
<br>In 1897 Chatterjee returned to India, and was posted to the United Provinces, where he remained for nine years in district administration. Also in 1897 he married Vina Mookerjee (<i>d</i>. 1905), with whom he had two daughters. A period of special duty, during which he conducted a comprehensive survey and produced a report on the industries of his province, was followed in 1912 by his appointment as registrar of co-operative credit societies for the United Provinces. In 1917 Sir James Meston selected him for the post of revenue secretary in the province, and this was followed in 1919 by his appointment as chief secretary under the lieutenant-governor, Sir Harcourt Butler. He was sent in the same year to Washington as the representative of India at the first international labour conference, and attendance at the Geneva conference of 1921 was followed by his appointment as secretary to the government of India in the newly constituted department of industries under Sir Thomas Holland. In 1923 Chatterjee himself became the member of the executive council responsible for the department, and he was largely responsible for the labour legislation initiated and passed from 1922 onwards. On 30 April 1924 he married Gladys Mary (1883&#150;1969), daughter of Captain William Barnard Broughton of the Dorsetshire regiment. She had been a member of the Indian educational service and an adviser to the government of India on issues of women's and child welfare. She was called to the bar in 1933.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1924 the viceroy, Lord Reading, offered Chatterjee the post of high commissioner for India in London. His wide administrative experience and intellectual gifts, combined with a ready adaptability to new demands and surroundings, made him an admirable choice for the post at a difficult point in its history. India House in Aldwych was built at Chatterjee's initiative to provide suitably spacious and dignified accommodation for the representative of the Indian government in London; it was formally opened by King George V in the summer of 1930. Chatterjee, who had been appointed KCIE in 1925, was appointed KCSI in 1930. The move to London provided him with an enlarged role in the international field: he represented India at six consecutive annual sessions of the international labour conference from 1924, and again in 1933. He was a member of the governing body of the International Labour Organization for five years (1926&#150;31), its vice-president in 1932, and president in 1933. In 1927 he was unanimously elected president of the tenth international labour conference. He also served as a member of the Imperial Economic Committee (1925&#150;31), represented India at the League of Nations assembly in 1925, and led the International Labour Organization delegation to the abortive world economic conference of 1933. He served the League of Nations as vice-president of the consultative economic committee, and as a member of the permanent central opium board and of the allocations committee. He was Indian delegate to the London naval conference of 1930. Confidence in his diplomatic gifts within imperial circles was marked by his appointment to lead the Indian delegation to the Ottawa conference of 1932. In 1933 he was promoted GCIE. Chatterjee's term of office as high commissioner ended in 1931. He was then appointed to the Council of India for the statutory period of five years. His last appointment, in 1942, was as adviser to the secretary of state for India, which he held until India became independent in 1947.<br>
<br>Chatterjee served on the council of the Royal Society of Arts for twenty years, and was its chairman in 1939&#150;40, the first Indian to hold this position. He was for many years vice-chairman of the council of the East India Association, and was also a member of the council of the Royal Asiatic Society. His intellectual interests were principally historical: he published <span class="italic">A Short History of India</span> (1936) with W. H. Moreland, an Indian Civil Service colleague; <span class="italic">The New India</span> (1948); and, with Sir Richard Burn, <span class="italic">British Contributions to Indian Studies</span> (1943). He was a fellow of the University of Allahabad (1908) and an honorary LLD of Edinburgh (1921).<br>
<br>Chatterjee sought to avoid political controversy, but lost no opportunity to advance his country's interests in the international field. In public he impressed by his sincerity and mastery of his subject; in private he was a man of simple tastes and abstemious habits. He died on 8 September 1955 at his home, 24 Motcombe Court, Bexhill, Sussex.<br>
