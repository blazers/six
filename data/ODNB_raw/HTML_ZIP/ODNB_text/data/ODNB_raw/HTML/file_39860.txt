<span class="headword">Silkin,  John Ernest</span>  (1923&#150;1987), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 18 March 1923 in London, the third and youngest son (there were no daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31684/', "Lewis Silkin, later first Baron Silkin (1889&#150;1972)")</script>, solicitor, who became minister of town and country planning in the Labour government of 1945&#150;51, and his wife, Rosa Neft (1889/90&#150;1947). It was a Jewish, intellectual, Labour family, and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40099/', "Samuel Charles Silkin (later Baron Silkin of Dulwich)")</script>, the second son, became a somewhat controversial attorney-general in the Labour governments of 1974&#150;9. John Silkin was educated at Dulwich College and for a short period at the University College of Wales, Cardiff, before going to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he obtained a second class (division one) in part two of the law tripos in 1942. He was then called up for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He became a lieutenant-commander in the intelligence branch and saw service in the Far East. On demobilization he entered the family firm of solicitors. He was admitted a solicitor in 1950. In that year he married an actress, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71127/', "Rosamund John (1913&#150;1998)")</script>, formerly the wife of Lieutenant-Commander (Hugh) Russell Lloyd, of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and daughter of Frederick Henry Jones. They had one son.<br>
<br>Silkin's first attempt to enter parliament in the Labour interest was in the general election of 1950 for the London constituency of Marylebone. It was a hopeless seat for any Labour candidate. Having unsuccessfully contested West Woolwich in 1951 and South Nottingham in 1959, Silkin finally entered the House of Commons in July 1963 for the south London constituency of Deptford, and very soon began to move upwards within the Parliamentary Labour Party. In 1966 he became chief whip in the government of Harold Wilson, a position which he filled with an agreeable competence until 1969, at a time when Labour had a majority of only three. He was deputy leader of the House of Commons in 1968&#150;9 and minister of public building and works in 1969&#150;70. It was in this period that he became close to Richard Crossman, whose diaries for these years offer a favourable commentary on Silkin's personality and political skills.<br>
<br>In the last Wilson government of 1974&#150;6 Silkin was given the office of minister for planning and local government. It was not a very happy appointment and in 1976 he was moved to the Ministry of Agriculture, where he was much more successful. During the years to 1979 he became well known through extensive press coverage of his disputes with the Brussels officials of the European Community. Silkin's own personal politics were now directly involved. He belonged to the left of the Parliamentary Labour Party, which clustered around the journal <span class="italic">Tribune</span>. In foreign affairs he was a unilateralist on the issue of the atomic bomb, and a vigorous opponent of Britain's entry into the European Community. His tenure at the Ministry of Agriculture was notable for the tough stance he took on European matters, using a strongly nationalist approach to the much debated issues of fishing rights, and agricultural policies in general. His public quarrels with Brussels greatly extended his political image among the British electorate. His general opposition to the European Economic Community was based upon his acceptance of what was known at the time as &#145;the alternative economic policy&#146;: import controls and the protection of Britain's industrial base, a withdrawal from Europe, and a renegotiation of the terms for a possible future entry.<br>
<br>The Labour Party lost the general election of 1979 and a year later, after James Callaghan had resigned from the leadership of the party, there was an election for his successor. For reasons which are difficult to justify, John Silkin confidently believed that he was a serious candidate as a compromise between Denis Healey on the right of the party and Michael Foot on the left. Barbara Castle wrote in her diary in 1976 that Silkin was &#145;the kindest chap, but has not yet proved himself a political heavyweight&#146;; it must have been his success against the Brussels officials that warped his judgement. In the first round of the leadership election he received 38 votes against Healey's 112, Foot's 83, and Peter Shore's 32. Nor did Silkin succeed in the election for deputy leader. This serious miscalculation concerning his own position weakened his general standing in the Parliamentary Labour Party.<br>
<br>In the years that followed, although he was on the Labour opposition's front bench, Silkin became involved in various disputes that he was to find very wearing. His own constituency Labour Party was much to the left of his own position and there were serious attempts to replace him as the candidate for the next election. They failed for the general election of 1983, but the continued friction helped to push Silkin into deciding in 1985 that he would not stand again. He was also much involved in a bitter internal quarrel over the control of <span class="italic">Tribune</span>, the organ of the moderate left.<br>
<br>Silkin had been brought up in an affluent family and he added to his inherited wealth during his own lifetime. His parliamentary salary was augmented by his continued practice as a solicitor. Among his clients was Robert Maxwell, which meant that Silkin had a place on the board of Pergamon Press. Silkin died before Maxwell was exposed as a fraudulent swindler on a very large scale. Silkin also benefited financially from property deals, one of which&#151;a family affair involving his father in earlier years&#151;prompted discussion in the national press in 1974. John Silkin publicly, and vigorously, defended his position.<br>
<br>Slightly taller than average, Silkin was well built. He died suddenly, of a heart attack, at his London home, 4 Dean's Yard, Westminster, on 26 April 1987. A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Deptford, on 23 June 1987.<br>
