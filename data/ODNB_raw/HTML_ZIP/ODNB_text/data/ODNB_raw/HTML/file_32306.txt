<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carr, Sir  Cecil Thomas</span>  (1878&#150;1966), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born at Poolemeade, Twerton, near Bath, on 4 August 1878, the younger son in the family of two sons and two daughters of Thomas Carr, a cloth manufacturer of Twerton, and his wife, Susan Arnell Creed. Educated first at Bath College under T. W. Dunn, who made boys enjoy working to their limits and gained their lasting devotion, Carr kept alive an association of old boys more than fifty years after the school closed.<br>
<br>In 1897 Carr went to Trinity College, Cambridge, with an exhibition soon converted into a scholarship. He was placed in the second division of the first class of part one of the classical tripos in 1899&#151;and the classics remained a resource throughout his life&#151;and in the third class of part two of the law tripos in 1901. Called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1902, he practised on the western circuit; and although his practice was still small when war broke out, private means had enabled him in 1911 to contract his happy marriage with Norah, daughter of the civil engineer Sir Alexander R. Binnie. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>His early years as a barrister, with comparatively few briefs, allowed Carr time to write. He twice won the Cambridge Yorke prize (in 1902 and 1905) with books published as <span class="italic">The General Principles of the Law of Corporations</span> (1905) and <span class="italic">Collective Ownership</span> (1907); and F. W. Maitland entrusted him with a Selden Society volume, which appeared in 1913 as <span class="italic">Select Charters of Trading Companies</span>. More light-heartedly Carr regularly entered for literary competitions, developing the lugubrious wit characteristic of his letters and speeches. He was good enough at various games to be an occasional recruit for county sides, and organized a cricket team for west country tours which inspired a series in <span class="italic">Punch</span> by A. A. Milne, one of his regular players; a tall, awkward character seems to be based on Carr.<br>
<br>Carr joined the 2nd / 4th Wiltshire regiment in September 1914, and spent the war in staff appointments in India. A year before he proceeded to the degree of LLD, Cambridge, in 1919 he became assistant to the editor and in 1923 editor of the <span class="roman">Revised Statutes</span> and of the statutory rules and orders (later called <span class="roman">Statutory Instruments</span>). His appointment followed from the chance recollection of his qualities by a former member of his chambers; and his main quality was a determination to make something of whatever engaged him. His duties lay in the edition and consolidation of the growing mass of delegated legislation, and in the consolidation of the statute book; and without the staff which Carr was later instrumental in securing for his successors most men would have been proud just to keep up with the work. But not Carr: with delegated legislation he made it his business to understand each item, and caught many flaws which had passed departmental muster; and with the <span class="roman">Revised Statutes</span> he hunted down suspect enactments, verified that they were obsolete, and himself drafted statute law revision bills.<br>
<br>Ultimately more important than his official duties was Carr's work in focusing thought on the problems of delegated legislation. He was one of the founders of administrative law in England, and played some part in the United States. This originated with three lectures given in Cambridge in 1921, subsequently published as <span class="italic">Delegated Legislation</span> (1921). When a congressional committee was considering the systematic notification of administrative regulations in the United States, a travelling fellowship was arranged which took Carr in 1935 to Washington, where he advised on techniques for the <span class="italic">Federal Register</span>, first published in 1936. This journey took him also to universities in the east and mid-west, where talks enhanced his reputation and gained him many friendships. In 1940 he gave the Carpentier lectures at Columbia University, published on both sides of the Atlantic in 1941 as <span class="italic">Concerning English Administrative Law</span>. Paradoxically this book was influential in England precisely because it was not addressed to English lawyers. Its historical detachment showed them the point they had reached after Lord Hewart's <span class="italic">The New Despotism</span> (1929) and the <span class="italic">Report of the Committee on Ministers' Powers</span> (1932). Ignoring slogans for and against the inevitable, Carr addressed the actual problems. It is the spirit in which the subject has since grown; though one might wish that Carr's imagination and values could also have been perpetuated.<br>
<br>In 1943, at an age when most men retire, Carr became counsel to the speaker, an office largely concerned with private bills. In securing procedural improvements generally, and in the passage of individual bills, Carr's resourceful helpfulness was widely appreciated. It was also extensively used. From 1944 to 1947 he headed a committee considering the law about parliamentary and local elections. From 1943 to 1965 he served on the statute law committee, and helped initiate more radical consolidation of the statute book. And in 1944 his experience with delegated legislation was again enlisted: the &#145;watchdog&#146; select committee then set up was granted the assistance of speaker's counsel, and Carr did much to settle the principles upon which it was to act.<br>
<br>Carr retired in 1955 at the age of seventy-seven. He was knighted in 1939 and became KCB in 1947. He became bencher of the Inner Temple in 1944 and KC in 1945. He received honorary degrees from Columbia in 1940, London in 1952, and the Queen's University of Belfast in 1954; and he became fellow of the British Academy in 1952, and honorary fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1963. From 1943 to 1956 he was election secretary, then chairman, of the Athenaeum. From 1958 to 1961 he was president of the Selden Society, editing for it after almost fifty years a second volume, <span class="italic">Pension Book of Clement's Inn</span> (1960), and travelling to Washington in 1960 to address American members. A year earlier he had captained a team sent to the United States by the Senior Golfers' Society, of which he later became president, to compete with their North American counterparts; and at the age of eighty-two he combined this with addresses to the American Philosophical Society and two law schools.<br>
<br>Carr played golf, on the course beside which he lived at Rock in Cornwall, almost to the end. No less energetic was his reading, also kept up to the end. As in his Westminster offices, everything was digested into untidy piles of clear notes which he could always find but rarely needed: what mattered remained in his head. He was offered an academic post when the First World War ended; and had he accepted, the problems of English public law might have been identified more clearly, more quickly, and much more quietly. But there is no saying what would have been lost without the practical authority exercised during a critical period by a shy man whose few words were always so compelling. Carr died on 12 May 1966 in the Nuffield Nursing Home, Wanford Road, Exeter. He was survived by his wife.<br>
