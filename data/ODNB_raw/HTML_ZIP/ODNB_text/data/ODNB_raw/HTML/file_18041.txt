<span class="headword">Bleddyn ap Cynfyn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1075), <span class="occ">king of Gwynedd and of Powys</span>, was the son of Cynfyn ap Gwerystan, probably a nobleman from Powys, and Angharad, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18040/', "Maredudd ab Owain (d. 999)")</script>, ruler of Deheubarth. According to English sources Edward the Confessor granted Bleddyn and his brother <a href="#cosubject_23449">Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn [<i>see below</i>]</a> the lands of their half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11695/', "Gruffudd ap Llywelyn")</script>, after the latter's death as ruler of all Wales in August 1063, in return for promises of service and tribute. In the early years of his reign Bleddyn was probably challenged by Gruffudd ap Llywelyn's sons Maredudd and Ithel, for it was only after their deaths in 1069, as a result of the battle of Mechain (in which Rhiwallon was also killed), that, in the words of the Welsh chronicle <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span>, &#145;Bleddyn ap Cynfyn held Gwynedd and Powys&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Hergest</span>, 27). In the meantime he had devastated English settlements in Archenfield (Ergyng) during Edward the Confessor's reign, while after the Norman conquest he joined Eadric the Wild in an attack on Herefordshire in 1067 and allied with earls Edwin and Morcar in their revolt against William I in 1068. After 1071 Bleddyn was the target of Norman aggression in north Wales, for Orderic Vitalis records that he was ambushed by Robert of Rhuddlan, who &#145;made him fly abandoning rich booty&#146;  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 4.145).<br>
<br>Bleddyn's rule ended in 1075 when he was killed by Rhys ab Owain, ruler of Deheubarth, as a result of, in the words of the <span class="italic">Brut</span>, &#145;the treachery of the evil-spirited rulers and chief men of Ystrad Tywi&#146;. The same chronicle claims that Bleddyn had, like Gruffudd ap Llywelyn before him, ruled &#145;the whole kingdom of the Britons&#146;, and also praised him as &#145;the gentlest and most merciful of kings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Hergest</span>, 29). His posthumous reputation was also promoted by the medieval Welsh law books, for he is one of only two Welsh rulers to whom they attribute changes to the native law of Wales following its alleged reform by Hywel Dda (<i>fl</i>. 903&#150;950). Bleddyn fathered five sons and up to four daughters with, according to later medieval pedigrees, four different partners, two of whom are identified as Haer, daughter of Gillyn, and an unnamed daughter of Brochwel ap Moelyn of Twrcelyn, Anglesey. The sons and grandsons of Bleddyn achieved a wide hegemony in late eleventh- and early twelfth-century Wales, and the dynasty he founded survived in Powys until the fourteenth century.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_23449"></a><span class="headword">Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1069)<span class="occ"></span> was the brother of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, with whom he shared authority until his death in the battle of Mechain in 1069. Rhiwallon had two sons, one of whom, Meilyr, was killed at the battle of Mynydd Carn in 1081; one of his two daughters, Gwladus, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23463/', "Rhys ap Tewdwr, king of Deheubarth (d. 1093)")</script>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_4319"></a><span class="headword">Cadwgan ap Bleddyn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1111)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and an unidentified mother, appears to have inherited a share of Powys after his father's death in 1075. Cadwgan first appears in the Welsh chronicles in 1088 when he joined his brothers Madog and Rhiryd in expelling Rhys ap Tewdwr from Deheubarth, but Rhys soon returned and defeated the sons of Bleddyn at Llech-y-crau; Madog and Rhiryd were killed but Cadwgan escaped and returned after Rhys's death to plunder Dyfed towards the beginning of May 1093. Cadwgan played a leading role in the Welsh revolt against the Normans which began in spring 1094, defeating a Norman army sent against Gwynedd. However, in 1098 Cadwgan was forced to flee to Ireland together with Gruffudd ap Cynan (<i>d</i>. 1137) in the face of an attack on Gwynedd and Anglesey led by the earls of Chester and Shrewsbury, and on his return the following year he made peace with the Normans and was granted a portion of Powys and also Ceredigion, presumably under the overlordship of Robert de Bell&ecirc;me, the new earl of Shrewsbury. Although Cadwgan, together with his brothers Iorwerth and Maredudd, supported Robert's revolt in 1102, he retained his lands in Powys and Ceredigion after the earl's fall and indeed increased his power following the imprisonment of both Maredudd and Iorwerth.<br>
<br>However, Cadwgan was unable to consolidate his position because of difficulties created by members of his family, especially his son <a href="#cosubject_20978">Owain [<i>see below</i>]</a>. After Cadwgan had held a great feast for the leading men of his land in Christmas 1109 (or perhaps 1108), Owain abducted Nest, wife of Gerald of Windsor. As a result, Cadwgan was expelled from his lands by his nephews Madog and Ithel ap Rhiryd at the instigation of Henry I's representative at Shrewsbury, Richard de Belmeis (<i>d</i>. 1127). Fleeing initially to an Irish ship in the Dyfi estuary Cadwgan then hid in Powys until he made peace with Henry I, who later allowed him to redeem Ceredigion for &pound;100 on condition that he give no support to Owain. However, following Owain's killing of William of Brabant in 1110, Henry I dispossessed Cadwgan of Ceredigion and granted it to Gilbert de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1117). After the murder of Iorwerth ap Bleddyn in 1111 the king granted Powys to Cadwgan, but the latter was almost immediately killed by Madog ap Rhiryd at Welshpool.<br>
<br>Cadwgan had at least seven sons and possibly one daughter with at least five different partners, among whom were Gwenllian, daughter of Gruffudd ap Cynan, and a daughter of Picot of Sai, lord of Clun.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20978"></a><span class="headword">Sir Owain ap Cadwgan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1116)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Cadwgan ap Bleddyn and an unidentified mother, destroyed Gerald of Windsor's castle at Cenarth Bychan after Christmas 1109 (or 1108) and abducted Gerald's wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19905/', "Nest (b. before 1092, d. c.1130)")</script>, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, with whom Owain subsequently had two sons. The immediate result of this action was the expulsion of Owain and his father from their lands and the flight of the former to Ireland, whence he returned in 1110 to Powys and raided Norman lands in alliance with his cousin, Madog ap Rhiryd, until they were expelled from Powys by their uncle, Iorwerth ap Bleddyn. Owain fled to Ireland again later that year after Henry I had confiscated Ceredigion from his father in reprisal for Owain's killing of the Flemish leader, William of Brabant, but was allowed to return and hold the greater part of Powys after the deaths of Iorwerth and Cadwgan in 1111. Two years later Owain blinded Madog ap Rhiryd and granted the latter's portion of Powys to Maredudd ap Bleddyn. Henry I's Welsh campaign of 1114 was directed partly against Owain, who was forced to submit to the king and accompanied him to Normandy, whence he returned, having been knighted, the following year. Owain's turbulent life ended in 1116, when he fell victim near Carmarthen to the vengeance of the Flemings of Rhos and Gerald of Windsor while campaigning at the king's behest against Gruffudd ap Rhys of Deheubarth (<i>d</i>. 1137).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_14442"></a><span class="headword">Iorwerth ap Bleddyn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1111)<span class="occ"></span>, a son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and, according to later medieval pedigrees, a daughter of Brochwel, supported Robert de Bell&ecirc;me in his revolt against Henry I in 1102; however, during the siege of Bridgnorth later that year he was won over to Henry's side by gifts and by promises of the Welsh lands of Bell&ecirc;me and his brother, Arnulf of Montgomery. His defection played an important part in ending the revolt, after which he soon seized and imprisoned his brother Maredudd and then granted Ceredigion and a portion of Powys to his brother Cadwgan. However, Henry refused to grant Iorwerth the lands he had promised him in and around Dyfed and in 1103 had him tried at Shrewsbury and imprisoned. Iorwerth was released in 1110 and restored to his portion of Powys. The decision to free him was probably prompted by the threat posed by Owain ap Cadwgan, who had joined forces in Powys with his cousin, Madog ap Rhiryd: Iorwerth soon expelled Owain and Madog from his territory. In revenge Madog had Iorwerth killed in Caereinion in 1111 with the help of Llywarch ap Trahaearn of Arwystli.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_18041"></a><span class="headword">Maredudd ap Bleddyn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1132), <span class="occ">king of Powys</span>, was the son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and, according to later medieval pedigrees, Haer, daughter of Gillyn. After supporting Robert de Bell&ecirc;me's revolt in 1102, he was soon seized by his brother Iorwerth, who had him imprisoned. However, Maredudd escaped in 1107 and co-operated with his nephew Owain ap Cadwgan, after the latter received Iorwerth ap Bleddyn's share of Powys in 1111; two years later Maredudd captured Madog ap Rhiryd and received the latter's share of the kingdom from Owain. After Owain's death in 1116 Maredudd was the most prominent member of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn's line. Although forced to submit and pay a huge tribute of cattle to Henry I after the latter's campaign against him in 1121, Maredudd survived and exploited the feuding between his nephews&#151;one of whom, Llywelyn ab Owain ap Cadwgan, he ordered to be blinded and castrated in 1130&#151;so as to establish a hegemony over the whole of Powys by his death in 1132. He was succeeded by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17762/', "Madog ap Maredudd (d. 1160)")</script>, one of three sons he had with his wife, Hunydd, daughter of Einudd. In addition he had another son, Iorwerth Goch, with Cristin, daughter of Bledrus, and fathered up to four other children whose mothers are unknown.<br>
