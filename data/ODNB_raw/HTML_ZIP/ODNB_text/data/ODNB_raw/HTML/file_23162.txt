<span class="headword">Rathborne,  Wilson</span>  (1748&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Richard Rathborne, a protestant clergyman, was born at Balnakil, near Loughrea, co. Galway, on 16 July 1748. In September 1763 he was entered as an able seaman in the <i>Niger</i>, with Sir Thomas Adams, on the Newfoundland station. As able seaman and midshipman he served for six years in the <i>Niger</i>. He then followed Adams to the <i>Boston</i>, and ten months later to the <i>Romney</i>, in which he returned to England in 1770. In 1773 he joined the sloop <i>Hunter</i> as able seaman, in which rating he continued for a year. He was then a midshipman for some months, and, seeing no prospect of promotion, accepted a warrant as master of the <i>Hunter</i>.<br>
<br>It was not until 1780 that Rathborne was allowed to return to England, and, having obtained an introduction to the earl of Sandwich, he passed his examination on 16 March; two days later he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Bedford</i>, with Commodore Edmund Affleck. In the <i>Bedford</i> he was present in the actions off the Chesapeake on 16 March and 5 September 1781, at St Kitts in January, and in Admiral George Rodney's actions under the lee of Dominica on 9 and 12 April 1782. In the summer of 1783 the <i>Bedford</i> returned to England and was paid off. At the time of the armament of 1787 Rathborne was in the <i>Atlas</i>, carrying Sir Edmund Affleck's flag; afterwards he was appointed to the <i>Colossus</i>, one of the Channel Fleet, in which he remained until 1791. In December 1792 he was appointed to the <i>Captain</i>, in which he went to the Mediterranean in 1793, and took part in the occupation of Toulon, the reduction of Corsica, and the action of 14 March 1795, when he was severely wounded in the right arm, and lost his right eye. He was invalided for the recovery of his health, and on 9 November 1795 was promoted to the rank of commander.<br>
<br>In 1797 Rathborne had command of the <i>Good Design</i>, convoying the trade from Leith to the Elbe, or to Elsinore. In December 1799 he was appointed to the brig <i>Racoon</i>, which he commanded in the channel, the Mediterranean, and the West Indies. On 18 November 1802 he was promoted captain and posted to the <i>Santa Margarita</i>, He returned to England in 1803, and, in the <i>Santa Margarita</i>, was attached to the Channel Fleet. On 4 November 1805 he was in company with Sir Richard John Strachan when he fell in with the French ships which, under Dumanoir, had escaped from Trafalgar. Now, harassed by the frigates <i>Santa Margarita</i> and <i>Phoenix</i>, they were brought to action and all taken. Rathborne almost immediately afterwards received an appointment to the <i>Foudroyant</i>, to which he objected, and on Admiralty orders he was permitted to remain in the <i>Santa Margarita</i> until December 1807, when the ship, being quite worn out, was paid off. For the next two years Rathborne commanded the sea fencibles of the Essex coast, and from 1810 to 1813 he had charge of the impress service in the Tyne. In 1822 he was appointed superintendent of the ordinary at Chatham, a post which he held until 1825. He had married, in 1805, Cecilia Mary, a daughter of John French of Loughrea, co. Galway; the couple had three sons. His sister Hester was the mother of John Wilson Croker, the politician and writer. Rathborne retained a connection with Loughrea all his life, and may have had property there, as well as a house in Kensington, London. He died in the summer of 1831.<br>
