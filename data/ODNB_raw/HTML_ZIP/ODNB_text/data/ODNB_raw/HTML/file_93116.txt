<span class="headword">Dunstan,  Gordon Reginald</span>  (1917&#150;2004), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman, theologian, and writer on medical ethics</span>, was born on 25 April 1917 at 79 Beaumont Street, Stoke, Plymouth, the son of Frederick John Menhenett Dunstan, an engineer's draftsman at the city's naval dockyard, and his wife, Winifred Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Orchard. He was educated at Plymouth grammar school before studying history at the University of Leeds, where he took a first-class degree in 1938 and graduated MA with distinction in 1939. A proud Devonian, he maintained his historical interests throughout his life, publishing <span class="italic">The Register of Edmund Lacy, Bishop of Exeter, 1420&#150;1455</span> in five volumes between 1963 and 1972.<br>
<br>After training for ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, Yorkshire, Dunstan served in curacies in Halifax and Huddersfield before becoming sub-warden at St Deniol's Library, Hawarden (1945&#150;9). On 23 August 1949 he married Ruby Maud (Ruth) Fitzer (<i>d</i>. 2003), a 34-year-old teacher and daughter of Herbert John Fitzer, a retired naval seaman; they had two sons and a daughter. In the same year he became vicar of Sutton Courtenay in Berkshire, where he conducted the funeral of Eric Blair (George Orwell), and Appleford in Oxfordshire, where he ministered until 1955. During this time he was also a lecturer at William Temple College, Rugby (1947&#150;9), and Ripon Hall, Oxford (1953&#150;5). Then began a series of posts in which Dunstan shaped the Church of England's social policy in ways that had a marked influence on government. Between 1955 and 1959 he was a minor canon at St George's Chapel, Windsor, and at Westminster Abbey from 1959 to 1965, during which time he was also secretary to the Church of England's council for social work (1955&#150;63), editor of the council's journal <span class="italic">Crucible</span> (1962&#150;6), and later of <span class="italic">Theology</span> (1965&#150;75). In their different ways both journals bridged academic theology and pastoral practice. From 1966 he was canon-theologian of Leicester Cathedral and in the following year was appointed the first F. D. Maurice professor of moral and social theology at King's College, London, where he taught for fifteen years. At that time the F. D. Maurice chair was one of only three such posts in England, the others being at Oxford and Manchester. While at King's College he was for six years from 1976 chaplain to the queen.<br>
<br>Dunstan stood in a tradition of Anglican moral and social thought particularly influenced by Kenneth Kirk, Robert Mortimer, and Alec Vidler. Dunstan insisted that the study of ethics started with philosophy, and his undergraduate courses began with Aristotle and Aquinas. His own ethical work nearly always opened with a description and analysis of the facts of the case. He was meticulous in his listening to, and questioning of, practitioners in every field of inquiry and he put theology to the service of these other disciplines. On one undergraduate's essay he commented, &#145;Best not to begin with the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146;. Yet he was clear that the scriptures and Christian tradition illuminated and guided those facing moral problems and dilemmas. Within King's he built a reputation for working with other disciplines, notably medicine and the new war studies department. He was made a fellow of the college in 1974.<br>
<br>Dunstan's first book, <span class="italic">The Family is not Broken</span> (1962), led to his playing a major role in the work of a group appointed by Michael Ramsey, archbishop of Canterbury, and chaired by Robert Mortimer, to advise on changes to the divorce law. Their report, <span class="italic">Putting Asunder</span> (1966), built on the distinction between law and morality, its own remit being the law. In place of the &#145;matrimonial offences&#146;&#151;with the notion of there being an &#145;innocent&#146; against a &#145;guilty&#146; party, which all too often bore no relation to the facts&#151;the report proposed irretrievable breakdown as the basis for divorce, contributing materially to the <span class="roman">Divorce Reform Act</span> (1969).<br>
<br>In what was perhaps his most important book, <span class="italic">The Artifice of Ethics</span> (1974), Dunstan developed the idea that the moralist's task was to help build institutions and conventions that supported morality. In keeping with this he served on a considerable number of government committees and advisory and regulatory bodies, notably concerning medical ethics but also the licensing of experiments on animals. This period also saw the development of in-vitro fertilization, which some sought to ban while others refused to consider the difficulties and disadvantages that might arise from this new medical procedure. With government policies slow to emerge, Dunstan in the interim (1985&#150;91) served on the Voluntary Licensing Authority, which had no legal power but considerable authority, refusing or granting licences to projected work. The authority's work was hugely influential on the way this work was continued by its official successor. A series of later books, typically co-written with medical writers, explored the ethical implications of a range of medical developments and situations. These works included <span class="italic">Consent in Medicine</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">The Status of the Human Embryo: Perspectives from Moral Tradition</span> (1988), both edited with Mary J. Seller; <span class="italic">Biomedical Ethics: an Anglo-American Dialogue</span> (1988, edited with Daniel Callahan); <span class="italic">Doctors' Decisions: Ethical Conflicts in Medical Practice</span> (1989, edited with Elliot Shinebourne); and <span class="italic">Euthanasia: Death, Dying and the Medical Duty</span> (1996, edited with Peter Lachmann). Uniquely for a priest Dunstan was made a fellow of all the royal medical colleges, a measure of the very high regard in which he was held by that profession. Between 1985 and 2001 he was also vice-president of the London Medical Group, which did much to foster the consideration of ethics in medical training, and of the Institute of Medical Ethics.<br>
<br>Dunstan's thought was always elegantly expressed and his manner was immensely courteous. At King's College he was a committed teacher of undergraduates, who included Njongonkulu Ndungane, later archbishop of Cape Town. At times he could also be fierce. He disliked mean-spiritedness, loose thinking, and sloth.<br>
<br>With his wife, Ruth, who was also a considerable theologian, Dunstan created a hospitable home. In &#145;retirement&#146;, which he described as a myth, the couple moved to Exeter, where he became an honorary research fellow of the university (1982&#150;2002). He had been awarded an honorary doctorate by Exeter University in 1973 and his career was similarly recognized by the University of Leicester in 1986. Three years later he was appointed CBE. In their last years, after he had lost his sight, Dunstan and his wife cared for each other beautifully and were supported by their family and their local church. They moved to Birmingham to be near their younger son, where Ruth predeceased him in 2003. Gordon Dunstan died on 15 January 2004 at Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, following a stroke; he was survived by his three children. At his memorial service in the chapel at Exeter University, Helen, Lady Oppenheimer, a collaborator and friend, wondered if Dunstan was a traditionalist or liberal. She concluded he had a traditionalist heart, nurtured by the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, but he followed the argument where it led and was capable of changing his mind, for example about the ordination of women.<br>
