<span class="headword">Potter,  John</span>  (1673/4&#150;1747), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was born in what was subsequently called Black Rock House, in Market Place, Wakefield, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Potter, a linen draper of that town. There he was educated at the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School. The non-juror Thomas Hearne claimed that Potter's father was a &#145;rank Presbyterian and a continual frequenter of their meetings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.5); it has also been claimed that Potter was brought up a dissenter and was perhaps even destined for the presbyterian ministry. Despite his nonconformist background, in 1688 Potter entered University College, Oxford, as a servitor, aged fourteen, and on 18 May he matriculated. He must therefore have subscribed to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and while at Oxford, he wrote to his father telling him of his decision to conform to the Church of England. As the letter is not dated it is unclear when this took place but it was possibly about mid-1690. Similarly it is unclear whether his conversion to Anglicanism was recent or whether he had made the decision earlier but had concealed the fact from his family. It is probable that through the influence of the Anglican clergyman Edward Clarke, who had been his tutor at school, he had secretly decided to conform before he left Wakefield in 1688; his decision to do so, however, caused a serious rift with his father, which may have left him in financial difficulties. He had matriculated without paying the standard fee, since he was considered a &#145;pauper&#146;, and following his announcement to his father financial support from his family may have been withdrawn, thus forcing him to become the tutor of Gilbert Jackson of Forest Hill.<br>
<br>Potter went on to gain his BA on 23 January 1692 and his MA in 1694. On 2 May of that year he was elected Yorkshire fellow of Lincoln College, a position which he held until 23 June 1706. While at Oxford he was a pupil of two other natives of Wakefield, Thomas Bateman (<i>d</i>. 1690) and Joseph Bingham. It was perhaps due to Bingham that Potter, who had become skilled in Greek from an early age, developed his interest in classical history and patristics. These studies led him to write his <span class="italic">Variantes lections at Notoe and Plutarchi librum de audiendis poetis</span>, which he published in 1694 on the advice of Arthur Charlett, master of University College, Oxford. Charlett also paid for the publication costs and gave copies as new year gifts to his students and friends. During his lifetime Potter also published a number of other classical works, including his <span class="italic">Archaeologia Graeca</span> in 1697 and 1698, and his <span class="italic">Klementos Alexandros ta Euriskomena</span> in 1715.<br>
<br>In 1697 Potter was made rector of Greens Norton, Northamptonshire, where he remained until 1700; at the same time he gained the vicarage of Coleby, Lincolnshire, which he held until 1709. In 1698 he was made deacon, and a year later he was ordained priest by John Hough, bishop of Coventry, to whom he was chaplain. On 8 July 1704 he gained his BD and moved to Lambeth to be chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison. His career advanced quickly under Tenison's patronage, and two years later he gained his DD, on 18 April 1706, and became chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Anne. Also in 1706 he resigned his fellowship at Lincoln College and was made rector of Mongeham, Kent; on 17 February the following year he was moved to the rectory of Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Potter was a high-churchman. He had an elevated role of the clerical estate, upheld the independent rights of the church, and was committed to the authority of the ancient fathers and the example of the primitive church. These views were expressed most notably in 1707, when he published <span class="italic">The Discourse on Church Government</span>, a work which, according to Stephen Taylor, prompted Potter's dissenting father to start writing a refutation, although he never completed the work. Despite his high-church outlook in religious matters Potter was a committed whig in political affairs. It is probably for this reason that Thomas Hearne called him a &#145;famous Low Church Man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.79) and frequently criticized him. During the reigns of George I and George II whig ministers were keen to promote a close relationship between the political administration and the Church of England, and Potter's political affiliation ensured that he enjoyed the patronage of a number of leading whigs, of whom his principal clerical supporter, Tenison, was one. He also enjoyed the influential patronage of John Churchill, duke of Marlborough. In January 1707 Robert Harley, speaker of the House of Commons, to whom Potter had dedicated the first volume of his <span class="italic">Archaeologia Graeca</span>, offered him the regius chair of Greek, a position which he refused as he was by that time more interested in divinity than in classics. Due to the influence of the duke of Marlborough he was made regius professor of divinity, on 8 January 1708, and a few weeks later, on 29 January, he was installed as canon of Christ Church. At the same time he was appointed rector of Newington, Oxfordshire, a position which he held until his elevation to the primacy in 1737.<br>
<br>While at Christ Church, Potter married a Miss Venner, with whom, according to Hearne, he had ten children, of whom six or seven survived  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 9.238). However, only four outlived their father, two daughters and two sons. Potter's first son, John (<i>d</i>. 1770), entered the church and was advanced considerably by his father, attaining the archdeaconry of Oxford in 1741. However, John lost his father's goodwill and patronage when he married a domestic servant from Lambeth, a marriage which Potter considered unsuitable. Potter bestowed similar patronage on his son-in-law Jeremiah Milles, who later became vicar of Merstham in Surrey as well as of West Tarring in Sussex, and dean of Exeter. Potter's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22619/', "Thomas Potter (1718?&#150;1759)")</script>, became a barrister of the Inner Temple, registrar of the province of Canterbury, recorder of Bath, and a member of parliament for St Germans, Aylesbury, and also Okehampton.<br>
<br>It was again through the influence of the duke of Marlborough that Potter was made bishop of Oxford; installed on 9 May 1715, he moved to Cuddesdon. On 1 August 1715 he was asked to preach before the House of Lords on the first anniversary of George I's accession to the throne. His whig principles, which expressed themselves on this occasion in his firm commitment to the Hanoverian succession and the new administration, ensured that he became a regular preacher at court and at Westminster. He was later to preach at the coronation of George II and Queen Caroline on 11 October 1727. A chance for further advancement came in September 1719, when the dean of Christ Church, George Smalridge, died and many people, including William Wake and Francis Atterbury and those within the ministry, urged Potter to take over the position, despite his already being bishop. However, Potter appeared reluctant, due to ill health and poor eyesight, which had plagued him throughout his life, and the king disposed of the position to Hugh Boulter. Similarly in 1727 he was offered the bishopric of Bath and Wells and again he declined. According to Hearne, Potter was already hoping for the archbishopric of Canterbury, but Hearne's assessment may be unreliable.<br>
<br>During his time at Oxford, Potter became embroiled in the Bangorian controversy. Despite his prominence and his learning he had tended to remain aloof from public controversies in religious matters, particularly those between the high and low church, preferring to concern himself with his pastoral duties. But, following the publication of Benjamin Hoadly's infamous sermon on the nature of the kingdom of Christ, delivered on 31 March 1717, and the protracted dispute that ensued, Potter became involved. At his triennial visitation to the clergy of his diocese in 1719 he delivered a charge in which he indirectly condemned Hoadly's arguments and denounced Arianism, which he believed was threatening the Church of England. He was reluctant to be drawn further into the controversy but agreed to publish his charge when urged to do so by his clergy. However, when Hoadly printed a condemnation of Potter's views the bishop of Oxford was moved to write a defence of his charge, which he published in the same year.<br>
<br>In 1734 the bishopric of Winchester became vacant and, according to Lord Hervey, Potter hoped to be given that position, primarily because of the great cathedral library there. His hopes were not to be fulfilled, since the government decided to appoint Benjamin Hoadly, in return for his service to the whigs. In 1737 the archbishop of Canterbury, William Wake, died and the ministry had to find a successor; there were a number of candidates. Lord Hervey recommended Potter for the position, telling Walpole that &#145;Potter is a great man of undoubted learning&#146; who was committed to the Hanoverian succession; he went on to say: &#145;his Character will support you in sending him to Lambeth, and his capacity is not so good, nor his temper so bad as to make you apprehend any great danger in his being there&#146;  (Barnard, 89). L. W. Barnard believes that &#145;Potter may have appeared as a mild, cautious, scholarly, almost a non-political choice&#146;  (ibid.) and that Hervey believed that he would be a compliant archbishop. He was also a great favourite of Queen Caroline, which may have been influential. He was installed as archbishop on 28 February 1737 at St Mary-Le-Bow and returned to Lambeth House.<br>
<br>As archbishop Potter opposed church reform. In March 1738 he resisted calls for the reform of the liturgy along the lines of the 1689 proposals, and throughout the 1740s he was opposed to pressure for convocation to initiate reform. He did not always receive a sympathetic or flattering assessment from contemporaries. Thomas Hearne was a regular critic, calling him &#145;an ambitious, conceited, proud man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.107) who had been elevated within the church in order to promote the interests of the whigs but who was &#145;far from being a truly great man upon any account&#146;  (ibid., 9.367). The Arian William Whiston wrote in his memoirs that when asked by Queen Caroline about Potter's suitability for the newly vacated archbishopric he had praised him, claiming that he was a man &#145;of great <i>Piety</i>, <i>Learning</i>, and <i>Moderation</i>; and an excellent pastor of a parish&#146; and so had recommended him for the position  (Whiston). Whiston went on to say that the new position had made Potter &#145;high and pontifical&#146; and he criticized him for not taking action against the rise of Athanasianism  (ibid., 300&#150;01). While bishop Potter had attempted to remain aloof from the politics of London, despite his prominent position within the church and his political support for the whig ministry, for which he was rewarded. Instead he preferred where possible to remain in his diocese and attend to ecclesiastical matters there. As he wrote to William Wake, then archbishop, on 20 October 1723, he did not spend as much time at court and parliament as many of his brethren, since &#145;for several years past I have found I could be altogether as serviceable both to the church and state whilst I remained here in the Country as in town&#146;  (Barnard, 62). His nineteenth-century biographer Robert Anderson claimed that Potter &#145;took care not to involve himself too much in secular matters, but devoted his chief attention to the affairs of the church&#146;  (Anderson, ix). This lack of involvement in secular matters continued during his years as primate and led to criticism from his peers, particularly during the period of danger from French invasion in 1743 and during the Jacobite rising of 1745&#151;when contemporaries such as the bishop of London, Edmund Gibson, condemned his lack of involvement and leadership. However, as both bishop and archbishop Potter appears to have fulfilled his spiritual duties diligently, while being committed to raising the pastoral quality of the clergy.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his career Potter became isolated at court, much to his frustration. It may have been for this reason that he was involved in the Leicester House opposition to the ministry in 1747. Both Thomas Gooch, bishop of Ely, and Thomas Herring, archbishop of York, mentioned this involvement in their private correspondence. Gooch claimed that the withdrawal of Frederick, prince of Wales, from the election for the chancellorship at the University of Cambridge in 1747 was a personal defeat for Potter. It may have been Potter's involvement in this political struggle that prompted the duke of Richmond, on Potter's death later that year, to write to the duke of Newcastle, saying that the archbishop had &#145;died in good time, because he was growing an old Rogue&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32713, fols. 277&#150;8).<br>
<br>Potter died suddenly, of an apoplectic fit, at Lambeth House on 10 October 1747, his wife having predeceased him. He was buried in the chancel of Croydon parish church; a simple white plaque, inscribed with his name and life dates, was placed over his grave but it was destroyed, probably in a fire of 1870. He left a sizeable fortune on his death, of between &pound;70,000 and &pound;90,000. He bequeathed &pound;100 to his old school at Wakefield and left the majority of the rest to his second son, Thomas, thus disinheriting his elder son, John. His will later became the subject of a legal trial when one of his chaplains, John Chapman, attempted to use his position as executor to promote himself by using the archbishop's options, although he failed when Potter's family won their legal case against him.<br>
