<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bentall family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1904&#150;1993), <span class="occ">department store owners</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_46624"></a><span class="headword">Leonard Hugh Bentall</span>  (1875&#150;1942)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 2 September 1875 at Holly Lodge, Orchard Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, the second of the two sons and third of the four children of Frank Bentall (1843&#150;1923), draper, of Kingston upon Thames, and his wife, Laura, daughter of George Dowman, a pharmacist, of Southampton. He was educated at New College, Eastbourne, and Forest House, Woodford, and considered becoming an engineer.<br>
<br>Instead, on leaving school in 1894 Bentall followed his brother George into the family drapery business, started by Frank Bentall in 1867 when Kingston was still a small market town, and worked in the shop for a short time before spending two years employed at Jones and Higgins in Peckham, followed by a year with Peter Jones in Chelsea, gaining experience before returning to Kingston. On 5 February 1902 Leonard Bentall married Winifred Ivy Smith (1879/80&#150;1953), youngest child of Edward Smith JP, clothing manufacturer, of Bewdley, Worcestershire. They had two sons, Gerald Chalmers Bentall and <a href="#cosubject_62453">(Leonard Edward) Rowan Bentall [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and four daughters. At the end of the 1890s the firm bought several adjacent shops and knocked them down in order to build a new department store, which opened in 1904. By 1907 there were departments selling china and glass, stationery, silver, beds, and toys, and there was a Moorish tea-room, with &#145;Sesame&#146; doors which opened automatically.<br>
<br>When Frank Bentall retired in 1909, the annual turnover was &pound;60,000. He handed the business over to his sons, and Leonard became general manager. The name of the business was changed from Frank Bentall to Bentalls in 1912. George left the business in 1917, but Leonard continued the expansion, buying up more properties and opening new departments, and in 1925 he converted the business into a private limited company. In the inter-war years Kingston grew rapidly as a prosperous London suburb, and the opening of the Kingston bypass in 1927 helped to make it into a major shopping centre for Surrey and west London, able to compete successfully with the West End. In 1927, to celebrate the store's diamond jubilee, Bentall opened the Tudor restaurant (formerly the vicarage) in the main store, featuring murals by Herman Cawthra showing scenes from Kingston's history. A large covered car park was built opposite the entrance to the store in order to attract the wealthier middle classes. In 1926 Bentall had decided to install his own generator in the basement to provide power for the store, and he was able to introduce the latest electrical gadgets such as electronic calculating machines and power sunblinds. In the 1930s he continued to add departments, including a food hall, a theatre booking agency, a travel bureau, and a building department selling new houses.<br>
<br>From 1930 to 1935 a new Bentalls store was built, in order to bring all the new departments under one roof, while business continued in the old store as building work went on underground. The architect, Maurice Webb of Sir Aston Webb &amp; Sons, designed a steel-frame building faced with bricks and Portland stone which extended for 750 ft along Wood Street and 230 ft facing Clarence Street (the latter the site of Frank Bentall's original shop). The fa&ccedil;ade of the new building was modelled on the William and Mary wing of nearby Hampton Court Palace, designed in the seventeenth century by Sir Christopher Wren. Escalators were installed and many of the store's fittings came from Gamages in Oxford Street, which had recently closed. Webb also designed a new furniture depository for Bentalls, in the Italian Renaissance style, and a drawing of it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1936.<br>
<br>From the start, Bentall was interested in publicity and in the 1930s, under the publicity director Eric Fleming, who had been recruited from Gamages, Bentalls began to stage a number of exhibitions and other special attractions. In 1930 Albert Sadler and his Palm Court Orchestra were engaged to play in the Tudor restaurant, and in 1932 <span class="italic">Bluebird</span>, the car in which Sir Malcolm Campbell broke the world land speed record, was on display. When the transatlantic liner the <i>Queen Mary</i> was built, Bentall not only created a special window display but also organized school trips to Southampton to see it. One of the more sensational attractions was the Swedish diver Anita Kittner, who twice a day dived 63 ft from the top of the store into a pool of water. The food exhibition in the new food hall in November 1933 attracted 35,000 visitors, while the sewing exhibition in 1933 was attended by the Lancashire cotton queen. The store also hosted a schoolboys' hobbies exhibition, and a bonny baby competition, judged by the customers, as well as fashion shows. Every year Bentalls bought the floral displays from the royal box at Ascot to decorate its foyer. All this publicity, and the slogan &#145;Why go to the West End&#151;when there's Bentalls of Kingston&#146;, was successful, and the expansion continued, so that the number of employees grew from 1000 in 1925 to 2000 in 1946.<br>
<br>Leonard Bentall devoted a lot of attention to his staff and their well-being. In 1925 he started a bonus scheme for employees who invested in the business and he introduced a pension fund in 1929. There was a staff clinic and food parcels were delivered by its matron to those who were ill. When he and his wife returned from a world tour in 1937, the staff put on a welcome-home ball in the store. Bentall was brought up in a Congregationalist household and was active in the Congregational church all his life. He devoted much time and energy to charitable causes, in particular the Warehousemen, Clerks' and Drapers' School in Purley for the children of textile workers. He was president of the appeal which raised &pound;52,000 for a second school in Addington, and from 1924 he was chairman of the after-care committee, which helped to place the school-leavers in business, mainly in the textile trade. He was on the committee, and was later trustee and chairman, of the Steadfast Sea Cadet Corps at Kingston from 1911 to 1936, and he also built cottages at Mill Hill for the Linen and Woollen Drapers' Cottage Homes, helped to raise money for the Kingston YMCA in 1927, and was treasurer of the Roberts Marine mansion, a convalescent and holiday home for shop assistants in Bexhill, Sussex. Bentall was elected a JP in 1925. An enthusiastic cricketer and golfer, his other interest was gardening, and he created a magnificent garden at his home in Cobham. He died on 24 December 1942 at Oakwood Court, Givons Grove, Leatherhead, Surrey, and was buried at Dorking cemetery in Surrey.<br>
<br>Both sons of Leonard and Winifred Bentall made a career with the firm. The elder son, <a name="cosubject_56171"></a><span class="headword">Gerald Chalmers Bentall</span>  (1903&#150;1971), <span class="occ">department store owner</span>, was born at Glendon Lodge, Fassett Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, on 17 February 1903. Educated at Tonbridge School, he joined Bentalls in 1922 and was appointed a director in 1925, when the firm became a limited company. He became general manager in 1928. As a territorial, he was called up at the outbreak of the Second World War, but was released from the forces in order to help his father run the store; he succeeded his father as chairman and managing director in 1942. Bentall's first marriage, which took place on 30 April 1930 to Edith Marjorie Shouler (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), ended in divorce and on 2 March 1945 he married his second wife, Marjorie Sydney Meller (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), a department store welfare officer. They had one son. This marriage also ended in divorce.<br>
<br>Gerald was faced with heavy death duties following Leonard Bentall's death, and in 1946 the business was converted into a public company. He began to expand the number of stores in 1947, when he bought Bentall &amp; Sons Ltd in Worthing, Sussex, founded by his great-uncle Charles Bentall in 1875. The business grew to include stores in Ealing and Tunbridge Wells. He was appointed CBE in 1950, and on 8 October 1959 he married his third wife, Sybil Gladys Brett (<i>b</i>. 1897/8). He retired as managing director in 1963 and as chairman in 1968, and died on 17 September 1971 at his home, Witley Park, Brook, Godalming, Surrey. His ashes were interred on 22 September at Dorking cemetery in Surrey.<br>
<br>Leonard Bentall's younger son, <a name="cosubject_62453"></a><span class="headword">(Leonard Edward) Rowan Bentall</span>  (1911&#150;1993), <span class="occ">department store owner</span>, was born on 27 November 1911 at Ferney, 23 Lovelace Road, Surbiton, Surrey. Educated at Eastbourne College, he joined Bentalls in 1930. His father arranged for him to spend a year working at Harrods in 1933, after a plan to send him to Macy's, in New York, was cancelled because of the international financial situation. He was appointed a director of Bentalls in 1936. On 15 September 1937 he married Adelia Elizabeth Hawes (1916&#150;1986), daughter of Edgar David Hawes, company director, of Southgate, London. They had three sons and two daughters. In 1940 he joined the East Surrey regiment as a private and was later commissioned into the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He served in the Eighth Army at El Alamein, in Sicily, and the mainland of Italy, and took part in the Normandy landings in 1944.<br>
<br>On demobilization in 1946 Rowan Bentall became merchandise director of Bentalls and in 1947 he made a six-week tour of the United States, visiting thirty-eight stores. Much impressed by what he saw, he recorded his impressions in a booklet, <span class="italic">My American Tour</span> (1947). Like his father, he took a particular interest in publicity, with advertising campaigns such as the &#145;June bride&#146; in 1951, promoting the idea that everything for a wedding and a couple's future home could be bought in the store, and &#145;Italy in Kingston&#146; in 1955. He became deputy chairman of Bentalls in 1950, and after his brother's heart attack in 1963 he became managing director. Under his chairmanship, which lasted from 1968 to 1978, the turnover of the group doubled, and in 1973 he opened a new store in Bracknell, Berkshire. He published a history of the firm, <span class="italic">My Store of Memories</span>, in 1974. On 23 June 1987 he married Katherine Christina Allan (<i>b</i>. 1935/6), a physiotherapist.<br>
<br>Bentall died at his home, Hill House, Buckholt Road, Broughton, near Stockbridge, Hampshire, on 24 July 1993. He was buried on 30 July in the churchyard of St Andrew's parish church, Chippenham, Wiltshire. In 1982 his eldest son, L. Edward Bentall (<i>b</i>. 1939), became chairman, the fourth generation to head the family business, which was still widely known as Bentalls of Kingston upon Thames. Bentalls stores continue to trade at Kingston and Bracknell at the start of the twenty-first century.<br>
