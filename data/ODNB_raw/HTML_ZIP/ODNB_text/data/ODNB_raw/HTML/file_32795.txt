<span class="headword">Des V&#339;ux, Sir  (George) William</span>  (1834&#150;1909), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 22 September 1834, the eighth of the nine children of Henry Des V&#339;ux (1786&#150;1857) of Baden-Baden, Germany, a clergyman who spent his time in foreign travel, and his second wife, Fanny Elizabeth, daughter of George Hutton of Carlton, Nottinghamshire. His grandfather was Sir Charles Des V&#339;ux, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1814), who had held office in the government of India. His mother died when he was two years old; his father remarried in 1839 and returned to settle in England, first in London, then at Leamington Spa. William was educated at Charterhouse School (1845&#150;53) and Balliol College, Oxford (from 1854), which he left in his third year without taking a degree, as he could not meet his father's wishes that he take holy orders.<br>
<br>Des V&#339;ux went to Canada in 1856, originally intending to farm, but instead settled at Toronto. He graduated BA from the university there, and also passed in law. After practising briefly at the Canadian bar, to which he was admitted in 1861, in 1863 he became a stipendiary magistrate and superintendent of rivers and creeks in an upriver district of British Guiana. Having been transferred to a coastal district including extensive sugar estates, which were worked largely by means of Indian and Chinese indentured labourers, Des V&#339;ux, an ardent liberal, formed the opinion that the &#145;coolies&#146; were grievously oppressed by the planters. He was reluctant, as magistrate, to enforce &#145;the Draconic laws against the coolie indentured labourers&#146;, and rather demonstratively took the part of the labourer against the employer, thereby incurring&#151;though not to the extent which he imagined&#151;the hostility of the planters and the distrust of the government. Relations became so strained that he asked for a transfer to another colony, and in 1869 was sent as administrator to St Lucia. From his new post he at once wrote to Lord Granville of what he regarded as the grievances of the indentured labourers in Guiana. He himself afterwards characterized his letter as &#145;defective&#146;, &#145;written in great haste&#146;, and &#145;without notes to refresh his memory&#146;. <span class="italic">The Times</span> described it as &#145;the severest indictment of public officers since Hastings was impeached&#146;. A royal commission of inquiry was appointed and Des V&#339;ux was recalled to Guiana to prove his case. The commission corrected certain abuses in the labour system, but Des V&#339;ux failed to prove what he later described as an exaggerated view.<br>
<br>Des V&#339;ux returned to his duties in St Lucia, &#145;depressed by a sense of personal failure&#146;, although the Colonial Office did not condemn him. At St Lucia he reorganized and codified the old French system of law in force there, put right the island finances, and started a central sugar factory. While on sick leave in 1875 he married, on 24 July, Marion Denison, the daughter of the pioneer of submarine telegraphy <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21831/', "Sir John Pender")</script>. They had two daughters and five sons, three of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>During 1877&#150;8 Des V&#339;ux was acting governor of Trinidad, and in 1878 he left St Lucia and acted for about a year as governor of Fiji during the absence on leave of Sir Arthur Gordon (afterwards Lord Stanmore). Des V&#339;ux successfully carried on the task of creating the first British crown colony in the south sea islands. After a visit home, during which he was appointed governor of the Bahamas but did not take up the post, in 1880 he returned to Fiji as actual governor and as high commissioner of the Western Pacific, where he remained until 1885. He was made KCMG in 1883. He was governor of Newfoundland in 1886 and of Hong Kong from 1887 until his final retirement from the service in 1891. He was made GCMG in 1893.<br>
<br>Thereafter Des V&#339;ux lived quietly in England, chiefly in London. He published his autobiography, <span class="italic">My Colonial Service</span>, in 1903, a pleasant, gossipy book in two volumes containing much of interest on colonial administration. He died in Brighton on 15 December 1909, survived by his wife.<br>
