<span class="headword">Robinson,  William Gordon</span>  (1903&#150;1977), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and college head</span>, was born on 19 May 1903 at Garston, Liverpool, the son of Frederick Robinson (1874&#150;1944), chief reporter and assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Widnes Weekly News</span>, and Helena Mary Tatlock (1877&#150;1951), schoolteacher. He and his twin brother, John Leslie, were baptized at Ormskirk Street Congregational Church, St Helens, on 28 June 1903. Robinson graduated in philosophy from Liverpool University (1924), winning the Edward Rathbone philosophy prize, and in theology from Manchester University (1927). Armed with the theology graduate prize, a research scholarship, and a Dr Williams Trust scholarship he proceeded to Mansfield College, Oxford, again graduating in theology in 1929. His PhD (Manchester) was awarded in 1951.<br>
<br>Gordon Robinson was ordained minister at Gatley Congregational Church in 1929, and while there he served as tutor at Lancashire Independent College. His pastorate at Gatley was notable for his ability to reach all age groups, for his leadership of the 150th anniversary celebrations of the building of the first chapel in Gatley, and for the decision taken by the church in 1930 to join the Congregational Union of England and Wales (CUEW). Robinson removed to the Union Street, Oldham, church in 1932, and on 14 December 1932 he married Phyllis King (1906&#150;1984), a schoolteacher. A year later they had twins, Ann Helena and David Gordon. He was then principal of Lancashire Independent College (1943&#150;58) in succession to A. J. Grieve, and of its successor, Northern Congregational College (1958&#150;68). During his principalship he faced numerous challenges: the maintenance of college life during the war; the integration of returning servicemen with younger school leavers after the war; the constant struggle for adequate funding in what was an independent, not a denominationally owned, institution; and the negotiations leading to the 1958 union in Manchester of Lancashire Independent College with Yorkshire United Independent College, Bradford. Students, books, and academic staff crossed the Pennines from Yorkshire, and Robinson found himself working with an associate principal in the person of Hubert Cunliffe-Jones.<br>
<br>In addition to his college teaching and administrative duties Robinson served Manchester University in a variety of ways; he lectured in <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (1943&#150;51) and in ecclesiastical history (1951&#150;70), and from 1948 to 1958 he was secretary to the faculty of theology. A welcome visiting preacher, he was twice chairman of the Lancashire Congregational Union (1946, 1956), and was chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales (CUEW) (1955&#150;6).<br>
<br>Gordon Robinson was a hard worker who put in a long day. Letters were answered as soon as they arrived, he was a capable administrator, his preparation for the pulpit and for college prayers was precise and well timed, his lectures were lucid and orderly, and he kept to publishing deadlines. He had a lively wit; he could be generous&#151;slipping his preaching fee to the wife of the manse in which he had stayed the weekend, for example. But he could also be peeved by those who attended prayers in carpet slippers, or who failed to attend at all&#151;such huffs being accompanied by vigorous puffs on his pipe and by equally vigorous attacks on his fire with the poker. Orderliness and etiquette meant a lot to him; failure in these matters was regarded as not only ill-mannered but as a poor witness. He had little patience with the pretensions of the pompous&#151;least of all if the pompous also happened to be ecclesiastical dignitaries. The clerical collar was anathema to Robinson, though it is said that on one occasion he was caught wearing one&#151;&#145;strictly for ecumenical purposes&#146;. For recreation he resorted to the Maine Road ground of Manchester City Football Club.<br>
<br>In his writings Robinson was as versatile as in his teaching, and whether for a specialist or for a wider audience his publications were always based on careful scholarship. There appeared studies of the books of <span class="roman">Samuel</span> and <span class="roman">Kings</span>; <span class="italic">An Introduction to the New Testament</span> (1949); <span class="italic">New Testament Treasure</span> (1954), consisting of articles reprinted from the <span class="italic">Christian World</span>; and <span class="italic">The Gospel and the Church in a Pagan World: a Study in I Corinthians</span> (1958). Other popular works included <span class="italic">Catchwords, Character and the Calendar</span> (1957)&#151;articles reprinted from the <span class="italic">Daily Dispatch</span>. Historical contributions include <span class="italic">William Roby (1766&#150;1830) and the Revival of Independency in the North</span> (1954), <span class="italic">A History of the Lancashire Congregational Union, 1806&#150;1956</span> (1957), and short biographies of Benjamin Waugh and Jonathan Scott. Robinson's elevation of the Christian ministry of every church member is reflected in his address from the chair of the CUEW, published as <span class="italic">Let us Give Ourselves to our Ministry</span> (1955); and in <span class="italic">Our Heritage of Free Prayer</span> (1950) he gave guidance on an art and craft which he himself practised in an exemplary manner. In &#145;Congregationalism and the historic faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Congregational Quarterly</span>, 29/3, 1951) he reviewed Congregational affirmations of faith, remarked upon the general disinclination of Congregationalists to utilize such products, and declared:<blockquote>[A] genuine trust in the operation of the Holy Spirit, held humbly, prayerfully and expectantly by ministers and people in their private devotion and in their gathering at worship and in the Church Meeting is not only our ultimate safeguard in matters of faith &hellip; It is of the essence of our existence. (Robinson, 213)</blockquote>On retirement the Robinsons moved to Grange-over-Sands. Gordon Robinson died on 1 February 1977 at Victoria Hospital, Morecambe, from heart disease. He was cremated at the City of Lancaster crematorium, Morecambe, on 7 February 1977.<br>
