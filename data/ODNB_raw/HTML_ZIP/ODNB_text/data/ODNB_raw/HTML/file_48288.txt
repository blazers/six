<span class="headword">Clodius Albinus,  Decimus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 197), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, was reportedly born into a noble family at Hadrumetum in the province of Africa Proconsularis (modern Tunisia). Albinus held a major military command in Dacia, on the lower Danube, early in the 180s, and possibly served as governor of Lower Germany before being appointed governor of Britain in 191 or early in 192. He thus held one of the major military commands in the Roman empire at a time of serious political crisis following the assassination of the emperor Commodus, the last, and unworthiest, representative of the Antonine dynasty. Commodus was struck down on the last day of 192. The strict and senior general, Publius Helvius Pertinax, was hailed as emperor, but only three months later was removed and replaced by Didius Julianus, a wealthy senator. His election was not generally popular and three months later he was killed in his deserted palace. The most powerful provincial governors had been notably unimpressed by the choice of Didius Julianus. The initiative was seized by Lucius Septimius Severus, the governor of Pannonia Superior on the upper Danube. He, Clodius Albinus in Britain, and Pescennius Niger, governor of Syria, held three of the greatest military commands; the civil wars which followed were fought out by these three and their armies.<br>
<br>Septimius Severus was the swiftest to act. Twelve days after the removal of Pertinax he had been hailed as emperor by his troops. In the search for potential allies he was bound to look to the forces under the command of Clodius Albinus in Britain. Albinus was offered the rank of Caesar, a position promptly accepted as an earnest of what it might lead to. Having thus neutralized, for the present, the threat on his western flank, Severus could turn his attention to his eastern rival, Pescennius Niger, eliminating him in 195. Albinus was now isolated but still retained possession of a formidable army. Severus gave clear notice of his intentions by renaming his eldest son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, a reference to the dynasty which had died with Commodus. Clodius Albinus Caesar was a redundant figure in the emerging Severan order and was declared an enemy of the state.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Albinus's activities between the early months of 193 and the winter of 195, when the final breach with Severus was effected. In 196 he crossed to Gaul, taking with him a substantial part of the army of Britain, no doubt hoping to gather additional military forces there. He was proclaimed emperor, issued his own coins, and won some successes in the field, defeating in the course of these actions one of Severus's generals, Virius Lupus. He took possession of Lugdunum (Lyons) in this campaign and prepared to face the army of Severus close to that city early in 197. The issue was contested on 19 February of that year in a hard-fought battle, in which Albinus's forces acquitted themselves well. But the army of Severus proved too strong and broke their opponents' line. When defeat was certain, Albinus took his own life. The battle was destructive of life to both sides and may have been followed by confiscation of property of those who had supported Albinus.<br>
<br>Very little is known of Albinus's personal life and circumstances aside from his origins in the urban &eacute;lite of Africa. He was married, but nothing is recorded of relatives or descendants.<br>
