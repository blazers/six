<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Saleeby,  Caleb Williams Elijah</span>  (1878&#150;1940), <span class="occ">writer and eugenist</span>, was born on 3 May 1878 at 1 Bedford Row, Worthing, Sussex, the only son of Elijah George Saleeby, the founder of the Mount Lebanon schools, and his wife, Frances Maria, daughter of the pioneering alienist Dr Caleb Williams of York. He was educated by his mother and then studied at the Royal High School in Edinburgh, after which he read medicine at Edinburgh University, where he was first in first-class honours for his MB ChB (1901). Saleeby briefly practised in Edinburgh as resident physician in the maternity hospital and in the Royal Infirmary, and then as a resident officer at the York City Dispensary, before moving to London in 1901 to work under Sir Jonathan Hutchinson (who had once been apprenticed to his maternal grandfather) at the Polyclinic, a postgraduate medical college in Chenies Street. On 24 June 1903 Saleeby married Monica Mary (<i>b</i>. 1880), eldest daughter of Wilfrid John Meynell and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35008/', "Alice Christiana Meynell")</script>, the poet. Monica's father was related to Saleeby, being the nephew of Caleb Williams, while her brother was the poet and publisher Sir Francis Meynell. The couple had two daughters.<br>
<br>Saleeby soon abandoned clinical practice for the life of a freelance writer and journalist, applying his knowledge and experience to a wide range of social issues. A turning point in his career came in May 1904 when he attended the meeting of the Sociological Society at which Francis Galton delivered his famous lecture on eugenics. Saleeby set out to popularize this new creed, and played an influential role in the launching of the Eugenics Education Society, founded in 1907. However, Saleeby was soon at odds with the society's officers: in 1913 its council even declined his offer to lecture to the organization. The main quarrel centred around Saleeby's increasingly outspoken attacks on what he called the &#145;better dead&#146; school of eugenists, whom he accused of discrediting the movement with their reactionary class prejudices. Saleeby also differed from most eugenists in combining a concern for heredity with an interest in post-natal care (the result of his training as an obstetrician) and with a desire to combat what he dubbed the &#145;racial poisons&#146;: venereal disease, insanity, and, in particular, alcohol. From 1907 to 1923 Saleeby regularly lectured on eugenics at the Royal Institution. But, although still playing his self-appointed role as &#145;counsel for the unborn&#146;, he gradually moderated his earlier confident belief in eugenics as the &#145;religion&#146; upon which depended the salvation of the world. Saleeby's interest in population questions never abated, but it is significant that when, during the First World War, he became chairman of the national birth-rate commission he seemed less concerned to emphasize the need for qualitative racial improvements, the main theme in his earlier writings, than to advocate policies designed to arrest population decline. The First World War provided other outlets for Saleeby's reforming energies. He acted as an unpaid adviser to Lord Rhondda, the minister of food, and vigorously argued the case for the establishment of a ministry of health as a national war priority. In addition, Saleeby developed an expertise in the design of protective body armour, and contributed to the invention of the steel helmet.<br>
<br>After the war Saleeby threw himself into the campaign for clean air and heliotherapy, or helio-hygiene, drawing his inspiration and many of his ideas from Dr A. Rollier's sanatorium at Leysin, Switzerland. In 1924 he founded the Sunlight League, of which he became chairman, and preached the gospel of sun worship in his regular column in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, written under the <i>nom de plume</i> Lens. A keen temperance reformer, Saleeby continued his lifelong attacks on alcohol, which he dubbed the &#145;most mortal abomination of our time&#146;  (Saleeby, <span class="italic">Modern Surgery</span>, 275), and in a stream of articles and pamphlets he also argued the case for smoke abatement, rational clothing, improved diets, and healthy exercise.<br>
<br>Saleeby's marriage to Monica had broken down by 1911. On 30 July 1929 he married Muriel Gordon (<i>b</i>. 1879/80), elder daughter of the Revd Robert Burland Billinge; the couple shared many interests, especially a love of music&#151;though, characteristically, he was keen to distinguish between &#145;healthy&#146; and &#145;morbid&#146; musical compositions  (Saleeby, <span class="italic">Health</span>, 372&#150;4). The couple were married by W. R. Inge, dean of St Paul's, who was himself a eugenist. At the start of the Second World War Saleeby moved his home from St John's Wood, London, to Appletree, Aldbury, near Tring, Hertfordshire, where he did unpaid consulting work in the local ante-natal clinic. He died from heart failure at his home on 9 December 1940. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Saleeby waged war tirelessly against what he called the diseases of darkness, true to his family name, which in Arabic means &#145;crusader&#146;. He was a tireless committee man, serving, <i>inter alia</i>, as vice-president of the Divorce Law Reform Union, the National Temperance League, and the National Council of Public Morals. Saleeby's handsome appearance and commanding manner made him an effective lecturer, and he addressed audiences all round the world in support of his favourite causes. He was equally fluent with his pen, contributing articles to a wide variety of coterie journals and popular newspapers as well as to the medical press. All his writings bear the same hallmarks: clarity of expression, polemical vigour, and the happy knack of supporting an argument with homely but apt illustrations.<br>
<br>It was perhaps as a pioneering eugenist that Saleeby exercised greatest influence, making that creed known to thousands who might otherwise never have heard of it. He boasted that he had invented the phrases &#145;positive&#146; and &#145;negative eugenics&#146; and &#145;racial poisons&#146;. Yet even in this field he managed to fall out with many would-be collaborators. Karl Pearson was furious at Saleeby's habit of referring to Galton as &#145;My Master&#146;, and Galton himself came to feel that Saleeby's occasional outbursts of silliness made him more of a liability than an asset. Yet Saleeby was important, not just as a popularizer of science, but for his role in dissociating population questions from the prevalent conservative orthodoxy. Saleeby joined the Fabian Society in 1910, advocated the emancipation of women, and never tired of proclaiming his belief in the compatibility between eugenics and social and political progress. In so doing, he became a leading spokesman for what scholars later called &#145;reform eugenics&#146;.<br>
<br>Although his name is not linked to any one outstanding work, Saleeby wrote over a dozen books and pamphlets, as well as innumerable articles. His earliest publications, <span class="italic">The Cycle of Life</span> (1904) and <span class="italic">Evolution: the Master-Key</span> (1905), are expositions of the cosmology of Herbert Spencer. His next book, <span class="italic">Health, Strength and Happiness</span> (1908), is very different in tone, demonstrating its author's skill at making scientific research relevant to the problems of everyday life. Saleeby then went on to write four of the most widely read popular expositions of eugenics, <span class="italic">Parenthood and Race-Culture</span> (1909), <span class="italic">The Methods of Race-Regeneration</span> (1911), <span class="italic">The Progress of Eugenics</span> (1914), and <span class="italic">The Eugenic Prospect</span> (1921). Among his other books are <span class="italic">Modern Surgery and its Making</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Woman and Womanhood</span> (1912), <span class="italic">The Whole Armour of Man</span> (1919), and <span class="italic">Sunlight and Health</span> (1923).<br>
<br>Particularly in the earlier stages of his career, Saleeby struck unsympathetic contemporaries as a crank, but many of the causes he espoused had become widely accepted by the time of his death: for example, his advocacy of clean air legislation, his warnings of the dangers of tobacco, his commitment to preventive medicine, and his calls for the training of parenthood. As his obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> observed, if people had heard little of Saleeby in his latter years, that was because so many of his crusades had succeeded.<br>
