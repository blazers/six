<span class="headword">Blomefield,  Francis</span>  (1705&#150;1752), <span class="occ">topographical historian and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 23 July 1705 at Fersfield, Norfolk, the eldest son of Henry Blomefield (1680&#150;1732) and his wife, Alice Batch (<i>d</i>. 1730), daughter of Henry Batch of Lynn. He came from a family of yeomen farmers and was the first member to receive a university education. He began attending classes run by the rector of Diss, but about 1714 was sent to Thetford grammar school. In April 1724 he was admitted sizar to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, under the tuition of Sir James Burrough, the future master of the college; he graduated BA in 1727 and proceeded MA in 1728. In March 1728 he was ordained and became curate of Quidenham, and in July 1729 he was instituted into the rectory of Hargham, which he held only for six months on behalf of John Hare. In September 1729 he was instituted into the rectory of Fersfield, the next presentation of which had been purchased by his father in 1708. He also held the rectory of Brockdish (1739&#150;52), the curacy of Poringland Magna (1736&#150;50), and ministries in the Norwich parishes of St James and St Mary Coslany for periods during the 1740s. He married on 1 September 1732 Mary (<i>c</i>.1707&#150;1796), the daughter of Lawrence Womack, rector of Buxton, Oxnead, and Caistor. They had three daughters, two of whom survived him.<br>
<br>From about 1719 the young Blomefield began recording monumental inscriptions from churches he visited in Norfolk, Suffolk, and later Cambridgeshire. While at Caius he started to keep genealogical and heraldic notes relating to local families, transcribed historical manuscripts in the library, and undertook some critical historical writing. Soon after leaving university he was actively collecting materials for a published account of the antiquities of Cambridgeshire, but in 1732 this project was deferred when another more promising opportunity presented itself.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1732 the course of Blomefield's career was determined when his friend Thomas Martin gave him virtually unrestricted access to an enormous collection of materials relating to the history of Norfolk. These had been amassed before his death in 1729 by Peter Le Neve, who had intended to publish a county history. Le Neve's collection included many original historical records, the notes and manuscripts of several previous Norfolk antiquaries and collectors, and transcripts, calendars, and indexes to local references in the public records. Le Neve had intended to leave them to a public repository, and appointed Thomas Martin and Thomas Tanner as his executors. However, the terms of his will were never carried out. Tanner was appointed to the see of St Asaph, and Martin married Le Neve's widow, Frances, in January 1732. The couple removed the collection to Martin's home at Palgrave, where they remained thereafter.<br>
<br>With Martin's encouragement and assistance Blomefield planned to use these materials as the basis of a county history, and issued proposals in June 1733 for <span class="italic">An Essay towards a Topographical History of Norfolk</span>. This was intended to comprise two quarto volumes, published in monthly parts over a two-year period beginning in March 1734. It was to be distributed to subscribers through local booksellers, or else by the author, his friends, or colleagues. The project excited sufficient interest to proceed, but Blomefield had no conception of the scale of task he was embarking upon, nor of the labour involved in collecting the additional materials required. His schedule was unrealistic, and publication did not commence until March 1736. By the time of his death sixteen years later Blomefield had almost completed three large folio volumes, but had only covered 40 per cent of the county. The years 1733 to 1735 were spent collecting additional materials, by means of tours through the county on horseback during the summer months, visits to libraries, record repositories, and country houses. However, the strain of travelling brought on a prolonged period of illness during the autumn of 1734. Blomefield was therefore compelled to collect materials through a detailed printed questionnaire&#151;an idea he may have copied from his friend Francis Peck. This was sent to several hundred Norfolk incumbents during the early months of 1735, and much useful additional information was gained in this way. While convalescing in April 1735 Blomefield was granted access to the muniment room of William Paston, the second earl of Yarmouth, at Oxnead Hall. Here he discovered &#145;innumerable letters, of good consequence in history&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 85), which are now known as the &#145;Paston letters&#146;. The means by which these and many associated manuscripts eventually found their way into his own and Thomas Martin's collections is obscure.<br>
<br>Blomefield recruited Charles Parkin, rector of Oxburgh, as a collaborator in July 1733, and Parkin took responsibility for the west of the county that was most remote from Blomefield's Fersfield rectory. Parkin therefore contributed the accounts of the hundreds of Grimeshoe and South Greenhoe published in Blomefield's lifetime. Other significant helpers in areas remote from Blomefield were Dr Henry Briggs, rector of Holt, John Holmes, master of the grammar school there, and Dr Edmund Newdigate, a physician from Walsingham. The antiquaries Sir Andrew Fountaine, Beaupr&eacute; Bell, and James Baldwin also helped, as did Antony Norris of the Middle Temple, who had substantial collections for east Norfolk. Bishop Thomas Tanner also greatly encouraged the project, both by commenting upon Blomefield's manuscript for the first two hundreds, and subsequently by granting him permission in his will to use the detailed registers of Norfolk institutions, compiled while he was chancellor of the diocese. Thus while the Norfolk history is indeed a co-operative work incorporating the work of many earlier and contemporary antiquaries, there is no question that Blomefield was the prime mover in its publication and the work is deservedly associated with his name.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1735 Blomefield considered himself ready to embark upon publication of his work, although only about 10 per cent was ready for the press. He therefore looked for a suitable printer. Enquiries in Norwich persuaded him that no printer there would have the necessary materials, and he was deeply suspicious of London tradesmen, whom he felt would be likely to swindle him. As a result he set up his own press at Fersfield and employed a journeyman printer, named Nicholas Hussey, from Bury St Edmund's. The autumn and winter of 1735 were spent converting a barn and negotiating with tradesmen for the supply of the necessary equipment and materials, and also for the provision of engravings and woodcuts. His press was ready to begin operation by February 1736 and the first part was issued to subscribers the following month.<br>
<br>Within a fortnight of publication the original figure of 320 subscribers had doubled, and as news of the work spread, new subscribers continued to come forward. As a result Blomefield was forced to reprint his first number on two occasions, and also to appoint a London agent, thereby delaying progress with the second and subsequent parts. Thereafter the size of the edition remained at about 800 copies. The project was further delayed for two months the following November, when Blomefield was again taken seriously ill. However, progress continued through the southernmost hundreds during 1736 and 1737 at the rate of one part every seven weeks. The twenty-eight numbers of the first volume were eventually completed by March 1740.<br>
<br>During 1737 the author began to receive complaints from subscribers about the practices of many of his bookseller agents, who were seeking to enhance the meagre commission he paid by imposing delivery charges, or else lending out the work to others before delivery. As a result, after Michaelmas Blomefield dealt only with a limited number of booksellers in the large towns, and made use of a rider employed by him for the purpose of delivering them in the country. These employees are reputed to have created just as many distribution problems, and created as many opportunities for creaming off his profits, as the provincial booksellers. Indeed Blomefield appears to have been in dispute with, or cheated by, virtually every workman he ever employed.<br>
<br>The success of the publication also gave rise to jealousies among the antiquarian community in Norfolk, notably with Benjamin Mackerell, who had helped Peter Le Neve collect materials and resented the unavailability of this collection to the public. Mackerell suggested to Blomefield that he should cover the urban areas of the county, leaving Blomefield to cover the rural. When the latter refused, Mackerell went ahead and published his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of King's Lynn</span> (itself a plagiarism) late in 1737. Blomefield then published his account of Thetford both as part of the history of Norfolk, and also simultaneously in quarto as a discrete history of the town. More significantly, Mackerell was known to be working on a detailed history of Norwich, which was complete and ready for the press at the time of his death in March 1738. Mackerell's work was never published, but the existence of the manuscript caused Blomefield to alter his plans in 1739 and publish proposals for the second volume of the history of Norfolk, devoted to the city of Norwich. Blomefield's 900 folio page history of Norwich, published between April 1741 and May 1745, represents his crowning achievement, and was the part with which he had least assistance. His public claim to have access to the papers of the late Norwich historian John Kirkpatrick was denied in the press by the latter's brother Thomas, who threatened to publish his brother's work. However, there was an element of truth in Blomefield's claim in so far as John Kirkpatrick had supplied Le Neve with his rough notes once they had been transcribed. The account of Norwich was simultaneously published to subscribers as volume 2 of the history of Norfolk, and also as a separate publication. Production appears to have run smoothly, although after March 1743 there was disruption when the press was transferred from Fersfield to a house in Willow Lane, Norwich. The suggestion by Chambers that this was after a fire at his press has not been substantiated; it was more likely due to difficulties recruiting skilled workmen in the country, or the need to reside in the city to collect materials.<br>
<br>Volume 3 was also delayed owing to ill health and the lack of a workman, but the first part was eventually published by January 1747. Throughout the 1740s Blomefield had used any free capacity of the press to print his materials relating to Cambridgeshire, which were eventually published as a small quarto volume, entitled <span class="italic">Collectanea Cantabrigiensia</span>, in 1750. The volume had reached the twenty-third part by December 1751, when Blomefield went to London to visit the Rolls Chapel and present a paper to the Society of Antiquaries. He contracted smallpox, and died at his Fersfield rectory on 16 January 1752, having exhausted his health and bankrupted his family. He was buried on 18 January 1752 in his parish church, St Andrew's, where there is a memorial. At the instigation of Thomas Martin, Charles Parkin completed the history of Norfolk between 1755 and 1764, although not with anything like as much care or detail as Blomefield had expended. Parkin's completion was published posthumously between 1767 and 1775 by Whittingham of Lynn. The work was largely pirated in a history of the county published by Crouse and Booth of Norwich between 1778 and 1781, and then reprinted in its original form between 1805 and 1810.<br>
<br>Blomefield's reputation was shabbily treated in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> by Walter Rye, who made scathing remarks concerning his work as a historian which do not stand up to detailed scrutiny, and spread unsubstantiated rumours about drinking and foxhunting. It is not difficult to find errors and misinterpretations in Blomefield's work, including his own genealogy, and the quality of the printing is poor. Yet given the period and circumstances in which he was at work, and the immensity of his task, his was a great achievement. His weakness was in underestimating what he had taken on. There has as yet been no other history of Norfolk on a comparable scale, and it remains the standard work.<br>
