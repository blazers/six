<span class="headword">Thorpe, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1372), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of Sir Robert Thorpe of Orton Waterville, Huntingdonshire, steward of the liberties of Peterborough Abbey, and his wife, Margaret. He has often been confused with a contemporary who was the second master of Pembroke College, Cambridge. The Thorpe family produced a number of prominent lawyers, and Robert's relative, Sir William Thorpe, chief justice of the king's bench, may have been influential in guiding him towards a legal career. Robert was created a serjeant-at-law in 1339 and was king's serjeant between 1345 and 1356. He served regularly on commissions of assize, gaol delivery, and oyer and terminer, and as justice of the peace, in Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Bedfordshire, and Buckinghamshire. His local connections are illustrated by the generous pensions and fees paid to him from 1352&#150;3 onwards by Ramsey Abbey. He also built up his landed base in the region, gaining life interests in estates in Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1356 Thorpe was appointed chief justice of the court of common pleas and assumed knighthood, and on 1 October he was awarded a grant of &pound;40 a year from the exchequer to support his new rank. His influence in the courts was recognized by both the Black Prince and John of Gaunt, who appointed him to their councils. In 1365 he was involved in an important debate on the relative status of ordinances and statutes. Appointed a trier of petitions in every parliament between 1362 and 1371, he took part in the parliamentary trial of Sir John de la Lee, steward of the king's household, in 1368, and in 1371 he was a member of the committee of royal judges appointed to inquire into the embezzlement of ransoms collected for the king by Sir William Latimer.<br>
<br>In the parliament of 1371 an anti-clerical movement forced the crown to dismiss the chancellor, treasurer, and keeper of the privy seal and replace them with laymen. Thorpe was appointed to succeed William Wykeham as chancellor on 26 March, though he did not formally vacate his judicial post until 14 April. The circumstances of his appointment suggest that he was in good political standing with the Commons. His tenure of office was, however, brief. On 29 June 1372, at the house of Robert Wyville, bishop of Salisbury, in Fleet Street, London, being very ill, he put the great seal out of commission by having it enclosed in a bag sealed with his own seal and the seals of Sir John Knyvet, the chief justice of the king's bench, and others. At the same time he made a will by which his executors, who included Knyvet, were empowered to sell all his moveable property and use the proceeds for the benefit of his soul. He died the same night.<br>
<br>In 1367 Thorpe had acquired a licence to alienate property in mortmain for the provision of prayers for himself, his parents, and benefactors in the chapel of St Mary, Maxey, in Northamptonshire. On 24 March 1373 his executors received a similar licence to found a chantry in Helpston church (also in Northamptonshire), served by three chaplains, to celebrate divine service for the king, the souls of queens Isabella and Philippa, and those of Thorpe and his parents. Thorpe, who evidently never married, was buried with other members of his family in Peterborough Abbey; a commemorative brass depicting him in his judge's robes was destroyed during the civil war.<br>
