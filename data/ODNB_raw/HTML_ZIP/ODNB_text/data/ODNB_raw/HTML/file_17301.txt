<span class="headword">Lyte,  Henry</span>  (1529?&#150;1607), <span class="occ">botanist and antiquary</span>, was born at Lyte's Cary, Somerset, the eleventh, in direct descent, of his name settled at that place. He was the second and eldest surviving son of John Lyte (<i>d</i>. 1576) and his first wife, Edith Horsey (<i>d</i>. 1556). Lyte became a student at Oxford about 1546 but it is unlikely that he took a degree. Anthony Wood wrote of him:<blockquote>After he had spent some years in logic and philosophy, and in other good learning, he travelled into foreign countries, and at length retired to his patrimony, where, by the advantage of a good foundation of literature made in the university and abroad, he became a most excellent scholar in several sorts of learning. (Wood)</blockquote>His son recorded that he &#145;was admitted of Clyffordes Inne&#146;. From 1559 Lyte seems to have managed his father's Somerset estate until the latter's death in 1576, when his stepmother, who had already sown discord between him and his father, brought a writ of dower against him. Lyte seems to have served as sheriff, or perhaps only as under-sheriff, of Somerset during the reign of Mary, and perhaps until the second year of Elizabeth. He captained one of the Somerset trained bands formed to fight the Spanish invasion, and was serving at Tilbury at the time of the armada.<br>
<br>Lyte was married three times: in September 1546 to Agnes, daughter and heir of John Kelloway of Collumpton, Devon, who died in 1564 and with whom he had five daughters; in July 1565 to Frances, daughter of John Tiptoft, citizen of London, who died in 1589 and with whom he had three sons and two daughters; and in 1591 to Dorothy, daughter of John Gover of Somerton, Somerset, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Lyte was a distant connection of Aubrey, who speaks of his &#145;deare grandfather Lyte&#146; and of a &#145;cos. Lyte of Lytes-Cary&#146;, and says that Henry Lyte &#145;had a pretty good collection of plants for that age&#146;. The garden at Lyte's Cary was well known in its day for having all possible kinds of fruit including ninety varieties of pear; a description survives in an extant list in the handwriting of Lyte's second son, Thomas.<br>
<br>Lyte's first and most important work was his careful translation of the <span class="italic">Cruydeboeck</span>, or herbal, of Rembert Dodoens (Antwerp, 1554), taken from the French edition of De l'Escluse (1557) and augmented clearly, in a different typeface, by his own notes. His only additional matter concerned the habitats of some Somerset plants. His working copy, annotated in Latin and English in his neat handwriting, endorsed &#145;Henry Lyte taught me to speake English&#146;, is in the British Library. It was printed in folio at Antwerp, in order to secure the woodcuts of the original. A dedication to Queen Elizabeth, written from Lyte's Cary, states Lyte's wish to contribute something to the welfare and renown of his country as well as to the health of its people. Other editions, without woodcuts, were published in 1586, 1595, and 1619; an abridged version appeared in 1606.<br>
<br>Lyte was interested in genealogy of a fanciful kind and spent much time in seeking to show how the British were of Trojan descent, as set out in his second work, <span class="italic">The Light of Britayne: a Recorde of the Honorable Originall and Antiquitie of Britaine</span> (1588), which was also dedicated to Elizabeth, and which contained her portrait. Lyte presented a copy of this work to the queen on 24 November 1588, when she went in state to St Paul's to return thanks for the defeat of the armada. Two small works on the same subject, written in 1592, were never printed. Lyte also drew up <span class="italic">A table whereby it is supposed that Lyte of Lytescarie sprange of the race and stocke of Leitus &hellip; and that his ancestors came to Englande first with Brute</span>, now in the British Library, and wrote a poem entitled &#145;A description of the swannes of Carie that came first under mightie Brute's protection from Caria in Asia to Carie in Britain&#146;, later printed in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>  (6th ser., 8, 1883, 109&#150;10). Lyte died in the house in which he was born, on 15 October 1607, and was buried at the north end of the transept of Charlton Mackrell church.<br>
<br>Lyte's second son, who succeeded him, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17303/', "Thomas Lyte (1568&#150;1638)")</script>, genealogist. His third son, Henry (<i>b</i>. 1573), was one of the earliest users of decimal fractions, and published in 1619 <span class="italic">The Art of Tens and Decimall Arithmetike</span>, dedicated to Charles, prince of Wales, and based mainly on the French work <span class="italic">La disme</span>, published in 1590. He is described as a teacher of arithmetic in London.<br>
