<span class="headword">Canning,  Hubert George  de Burgh</span>, second marquess of Clanricarde  (1832&#150;1916), <span class="occ">landlord in Ireland</span>, was born on 30 November 1832, the younger son of Ulick John de Burgh, first marquess and fourteenth earl of Clanricarde (1802&#150;1874), and his wife, Lady Harriet, the only daughter of George Canning. He was on poor terms with his father and identified with his mother's family. Later there were unfounded rumours that his biological father was a Russian nobleman. Educated at Harrow School, he entered the diplomatic service in 1852, and was for ten years attach&eacute; at Turin, retiring in 1863 after inheriting (in 1862) the fortune of his maternal uncle, Earl Canning, whose surname he assumed. His financial position had previously been extremely precarious, which is said to have been the cause of his lifelong miserliness. In 1867 the death of his elder brother made him heir to the marquessate. He succeeded his brother as Liberal MP for co. Galway (1867&#150;71). The home rule victory in the by-election after his resignation marked the decline of landlord influence; he later denounced his tenants' &#145;disloyalty&#146; to his father in 1871.<br>
<br>After his father's death in 1874, Clanricarde lived in rented rooms in London, never visiting his east Galway estates. He lived frugally, apart from the acquisition of an art collection, and allegedly engaged in money lending. In later life he enjoyed ice-skating. Although his estates were not highly rented he saw them as his absolute property, and denied that the tenants had any moral right to object to the contract by which they held them. With the rise of land agitation after the bad harvests of 1879, this unyielding attitude, coupled with his unsociable personality and his position as the stereotypical absentee landlord whose relationship with his tenants was merely that of rent-receiver, made him a major target; his financial resources enabled him to resist effectively. His obduracy brought him into conflict even with some of his land agents; he is alleged to have told one: &#145;If my tenants think they can intimidate me by shooting you, they are very much mistaken&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1886 the Clanricarde estates became a major battleground for the Plan of Campaign, whereby tenants demanded rent reductions and, if refused, paid the reduced rent to their representatives. Of 1159 tenants 186 were evicted after organized resistance, and &#145;emergency men&#146; placed in vacant holdings; boycotting and agrarian violence followed. Several tenant leaders and sympathizers were imprisoned. Even unionists saw Clanricarde as a political liability. One request for troops to assist with evictions was refused, and chief secretary A. J. Balfour privately advocated the compulsory purchase of his estates. (This was rejected by the cabinet as interference with property rights.)<br>
<br>Even after the collapse of the Plan, Clanricarde refused any compromise and opposed the policy of land purchase promoted by successive governments. The east Galway area remained a centre of unrest. His eviction of a Loughrea shopkeeper for political activities led to the passage of the 1907 <span class="roman">Town Tenants' Act</span>, and Clanricarde made a rare speech in the House of Lords against the 1907 <span class="roman">Evicted Tenants' Act</span>. The 1909 <span class="roman">Birrell Land Act</span> allowed the compulsory purchase of his estate and reinstatement of evicted tenants, but as he used every legal expedient to resist, not until July 1915 did the land court finally convey the estate to the congested districts board.<br>
<br>Clanricarde died at his home, 13 Hanover Square, London, on 12 April 1916 and was buried in London; some time previously he was evicted from The Albany due to refusal to pay an increased rent. Although heterosexual he never married. His marquessate became extinct; his cousin the marquess of Sligo inherited the earldom of Clanricarde, while his fortune was bequeathed to his great-nephew Lord Lascelles (later earl of Harewood).<br>
