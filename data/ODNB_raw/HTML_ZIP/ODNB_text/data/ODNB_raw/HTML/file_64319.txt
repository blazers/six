<span class="headword">Clifton,  Francis</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1716&#150;1724), <span class="occ">printer</span>, of unknown parentage, seems to have been educated at Oxford University despite being of the Roman Catholic faith. Between 1716 and 1724 he was notorious in London as a printer of cheap, seditious broadsheets espousing the Jacobite cause. He was involved in the production of three newspapers, the <span class="italic">Oxford Post</span> (December 1717 to 1719), the <span class="italic">Weekly Medley, or, The Gentleman's Recreation</span> (1718&#150;19), and briefly the <span class="italic">Orphan Revived</span> (1720) for Elizabeth Powell, another printer. Clifton's wife, Catherine, was also active in his printing business. Little is known of their married life, although Clifton described his wife as being pregnant in April 1720  (TNA: PRO, SP 35/23/37(3)), and later in that year, &#145;lame&#146;, while he portrayed himself as &#145;weak and consumptive&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 35/24/75(5)). His evidence, however, is not wholly reliable as he was at that time pleading for sympathy from government officials investigating him for his treasonable printing activities.<br>
<br>Francis Clifton was variously described as printing in Black House Alley, Fleet Street (1718), &#145;near the Ditchside&#146; (1718), at the Old Bailey (1719 and 1720), in &#145;the Libertys of the Fleet [prison]&#146; (1719 and 1720), in Waterman's Lane (1723), and in Little Wild Street. His frequent changes of premises reflect the precarious nature of his business, being often pursued for debt as well as for political reasons.<br>
<br>Clifton was probably the most active and persistent of a number of printers making a living by producing cheap broadsheets and pamphlets of an anti-Hanoverian and often Jacobite content at a time when, in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1715, George I's ministers were desperately concerned to stamp out any signs of support for the Pretender. Clifton had the ability to exploit the market for scurrilous popular ballads and verses which were reputedly cried about the capital in large numbers. One magistrate, Sir John Fryer, warned that Clifton's works, &#145;tho' they are silly ridiculous things, yett they do much hurt among the common people&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 35/18/35). A more sympathetic account is given by Clifton's journeyman, Thomas Gent, later himself a prominent printer in York, who noted his employer's &#145;poor circumstances&#146; and difficulties over debts, but presented a graphic picture of Clifton's busy enterprise carried on within the Fleet:<blockquote>Some time in extreme weather, have I worked under a mean shed, adjoining to the prison wall, when snow and rain have fallen alternately on the cases; yet the number of wide-mouthed stentorian hawkers, brisk trade, and very often a glass of good ale, revived the drooping spirits of the workmen. I have often admired at the success of this person in his station; for &hellip; advantageous jobs so often flowed upon him, as gave him cause to be merry under his heavy misfortune. (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 85, 86&#150;7)</blockquote>At least fourteen Jacobite broadsheets can be positively identified as having been produced by the Cliftons between 1716 and 1724, although this list is certainly incomplete. Thomas Gent records that on one occasion Clifton was secretly employed by the Jacobite Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester. Clifton's works included two broadsides on the death of the nineteen-year-old Jacobite John Matthews in 1719, the last printer to be executed in Britain. It is hard to assess how many copies of each of his pieces Clifton printed, perhaps between several dozen and several hundred, but these works were usually intended to be sung or declaimed to a wider audience in alehouses and gin shops, or on street corners.<br>
<br>Much of the evidence for the importance of the Cliftons in this period comes from the careful attention paid to them by authorities keen to clamp down on a dissident press: they were a prime target for informers, and raids on their establishments and several arrests followed. In 1719 Clifton was taken up for an edition of the <span class="italic">Oxford Post</span>, and in 1720 was gaoled as a result of a series of vehement accusations of treasonable work made by Richard Burridge, a hack writer and business rival. From prison Clifton wrote pleading letters to Charles Delafaye, the under-secretary of state responsible for his case, and even to a disdainful archbishop of Canterbury. He remained in custody until late March 1721 when he was finally allowed bail, the Treasury solicitor concluding that there was insufficient evidence against him to warrant prosecution. Another informer, Richard Shaw, continued to complain of Clifton's work, which was sustained despite the dangers of government action&#151;including the breaking up of his print by government messengers&#151;and Clifton's supposed ill health. In 1722 Clifton was again gaoled, this time on suspicion of printing &#145;lines&#146; on the arrest of the bishop of Rochester.<br>
<br>Clifton's Jacobitism was certainly persistent despite adversity. However he showed little solidarity with other Jacobite printers, offering to give information against those he clearly saw as business rivals if it would get him off the government hook, and denying that he ever received funding from Jacobite sources. He claimed that he was unfairly treated because of his Catholicism. Thomas Gent, growing disillusioned with his employer, portrayed Clifton as having an &#145;obstinate&#146;, violent, and &#145;ungovernable&#146; temper, and as &#145;ill-respected&#146;. The last work which can be attributed to him with any certainty was in 1724, after which, according to Gent, he &#145;proved himself a villain, in moving off to France with the money of a brewer to whom he was a steward, &amp; left his bondsmen to answer for what damage he had done thereby&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 112). Clifton is thought to have died in France, although the date of his death is unknown.<br>
