<span class="headword">Fraser, Sir  Simon</span>  (<em>c.</em>1270&#150;1306), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, was the son of Sir Simon Fraser of Oliver Castle, by Tweedsmuir, and his wife, Mary. The elder Simon, who had been keeper of the forests of Traquair and Selkirk, died in 1291, by when his son was of age. The younger Simon swore fealty to Edward I in 1291 and attested King John's homage to the English king at the end of 1292. Having fought against Edward at Dunbar, Fraser swore fealty to him again in October 1296, and in 1297, to gain release from English prison, he agreed to campaign with Edward in Flanders. He was rewarded with the return of his lands. He impressed the king while he was abroad and returned to Scotland in 1298 almost certainly as keeper of Selkirk Forest. In the aftermath of the battle of Falkirk he was involved in fighting with the Scots in that forest, and at the end of the year he was ordered to join an expedition for the relief of Stirling Castle. In 1299, however, doubts were again expressed about his loyalty. Edward's sheriff asserted that, when the Scots launched an expedition in the south-east, Fraser met them on the best of terms. There is a strong suggestion that the Scots were able to use Selkirk Forest precisely because Fraser was Edward's warden there. Yet in August 1299 the guardians appointed Sir Robert Keith to be their warden of the forest, and Fraser spent the period from 4 September 1299 to 12 June 1300 in a Scottish prison. This served to convince Edward of his loyalty, and on his release Fraser returned to English service and to his forest wardenship.<br>
<br>In March 1301 Fraser received his fee and robes in person at Lincoln, but by September he had changed sides. This volte-face was probably caused by his having been replaced as warden of Selkirk Forest by Sir Hugh Audley, as well as by a disillusionment over the scarcity of wage payments. He then employed his undoubted energy in trying to expel the English from south-east Scotland, leading a force against the garrison at Roxburgh early in 1303, moving on to the new peel at Selkirk, which he captured, attacking Linlithgow, which he failed to take, and finally defeating Sir John Seagrave's force at Roslin on 24 February. By June, Fraser and Sir Edmund Comyn were raiding south of the border. Nevertheless, most Scots submitted to Edward I early in 1304. As one who had personally betrayed the king, Fraser could submit only by agreeing to undergo three years' exile from Edward's lands in both England and France. He declined the offer and was outlawed, together with William Wallace, at the parliament of March 1304. At the same time the pair were &#145;discomfited&#146; at Hopperew, on Fraser's own lands. Fraser probably submitted soon afterwards, since on 25 July he and others were ordered to prove their loyalty by capturing Wallace. Although he was allowed to buy back his lands, his exile had been increased to four years, subject to recall. He was still in Scotland in April, when he was given leave to go to Berwick to discuss &#145;the state of Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">CDS</span>, 5, no. 492, xvii), but he soon joined Robert Bruce in his rebellion and was captured shortly after the battle of Methven. Fraser was taken to London and there hanged, drawn, and beheaded on 7 September 1306; his head was stuck on a pole beside that of Wallace. He and his wife, Mary, had two daughters, possibly called Margaret and Joanna. Sir Simon's death brought to an end the Tweeddale line of the family after which the Fraser descent continued through the Stirling Touch-Frasers [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54206/', "Fraser family (per. c.1300&#150;c.1500)")</script>].<br>
