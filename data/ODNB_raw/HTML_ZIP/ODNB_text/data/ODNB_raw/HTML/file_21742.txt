<span class="headword">Peckham, Sir  Edmund</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1495, <em>d.</em> 1564), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the second son of Peter Peckham of London and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Eburton of London. His father also acquired property at Denham in Buckinghamshire, while by 1516 Edmund had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1570), daughter of John Cheyne of Chesham Bois in the same county. He held a succession of offices related to government finance, beginning as a clerk in the counting house; in that capacity he accompanied Henry VIII to Gravelines in July 1520. In January 1524 he was promoted to be cofferer of the royal household, with joint responsibility for payment of household expenses and keeping its accounts. His further appointment in 1526 to the position of clerk of the green cloth brought additional responsibilities in the administration of household finances.<br>
<br>With promotion went rewards. Assessed in 1527 on lands valued at &pound;126 per annum, in 1536 Peckham was granted the lease of the manors of Alford, Eccles, and Alderley, and the stewardship of Londondale, all in Cheshire, which had been forfeited that year by William Brereton. He also expanded his family's estates in Buckinghamshire when Biddlesden Abbey, dissolved in 1538, was sold to him on 1 November 1540 by Sir Thomas Wriothesley (his kinsman by marriage). His responsibilities away from court grew as well. A JP for Buckinghamshire from 1525 to 1543, and for Middlesex from 1537 to 1543, he was constable of Scarborough Castle between 1528 and 1537. On 18 May 1542 he was knighted.<br>
<br>Well known to the king and his advisers, and with over twenty years' experience in the management of royal finances, Peckham merited his appointment on 19 May 1544 as high treasurer of all the mints. His promotion to this newly created post came as part of a sweeping reform of the royal mint. Committed to a major continental campaign, and already heavily engaged in Scotland, Henry VIII was eager to generate further revenues and saw the production of more coinage as a means to this end. He adopted a two-pronged policy: by covertly ordering a debasement of the currency he could create more money out of less gold and silver bullion; and by opening new mints in Durham, York, and Bristol, as well as a second mint in the Tower, between 1544 and 1546, he could greatly expand the means of production. Peckham was not directly charged with either receiving bullion or striking coin, duties which were devolved to the under-treasurers of the individual mints. Even so he is likely to have been frequently stretched, as the man with overall responsibility for supervising the personnel and running the mints during a period of frenetic production: it was later estimated that between 1544 and 1551 the mints produced debased coin worth &pound;1,323,281 14<i>s</i>. in gold and &pound;3,015,895 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in silver. With the gradual abandonment of debasement in Edward VI's latter years, however, Peckham's workload at the mint is likely to have dwindled accordingly.<br>
<br>On 18 June 1546 Peckham was appointed to receive the proceeds of the &#145;loving contribution&#146; granted that year to the king. In his will Henry VIII bequeathed Peckham &pound;200 and appointed him both treasurer to the executors and an assistant executor. But his religious conservatism was doubtless largely responsible for his being effectively sidelined during Somerset's protectorate. He was replaced as cofferer of the royal household by John Ryther in March 1547, and although he was briefly appointed to the privy council at the time of the autumn coup of 1549, attending meetings between 6 and 30 October, he probably owed his brief membership to Wriothesley's sponsorship, consequently losing his position when his patron fell. He remained treasurer of the mint, however, where he seems to have won admiration for his integrity. In 1553 his honesty was favourably compared with the corruptibility of others&#151;&#145;he never robbed his grace when he had all the rule of his treasure, he used not to buy silver for 4<i>s</i>. an oz. and make the King pay 5<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. as other false traitors did&#146;  (Brigden, 504&#150;5).<br>
<br>Following the death of Edward VI, Peckham played a key role in securing the throne for Mary. On 16 July 1553 it was reported that he and others &#145;of the force of the shyres of Oxforde, Buckyngham, Berks, Myddlesex&#146;, in number an estimated 10,000, had resolved &#145;to mershe forth towards the Palaice of Westminster&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1552&#150;4</i>, 293). This threat from the west put pressure on an increasingly nervous council and prevented Northumberland from summoning reinforcements from London. On 29 July Peckham was sworn a councillor, a position he retained until the queen's death. In October 1553 and November 1554 he was returned to parliament as one of the knights of the shire for Buckinghamshire. His experience as a senior financial officer also brought him employment at the heart of Mary's government. At the end of 1553 a reorganization of government finance led to Peckham's being appointed on 5 December to receive and disburse all the revenues of the crown, an appointment which gave him effectively a treasurer's role until autumn 1555. In spring 1554 he was additionally commissioned to receive the issues of sales of crown lands. Not surprisingly, his involvement in the day-by-day working of the mint seems to have become increasingly nominal. For his services he was granted a life annuity of &pound;60. He may have lost ground, however, as a result of the treason of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21744/', "Henry Peckham")</script>, executed in July 1556 for his involvement in the Dudley conspiracy.<br>
<br>Following Mary's death Peckham ceased to be a privy councillor, but he again remained treasurer of the mint. In his will, drawn up on 12 May 1563, he made austere provision for &#145;my body and vile carcas which is but earthe and duste&#146;, but showed himself essentially Catholic by leaving 20 marks &#145;unto my poore neighbours of Denham to praye for my soule&#146;  (will). To &#145;my welbeloved wife Anne Peckham&#146; he left &pound;500 and a life interest in Denham manor, and to his sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21743/', "George Peckham")</script> and Robert Peckham &pound;100 apiece; George, who may have been specially favoured as the father of Sir Edmund's grandsons, was granted the reversion of Denham. There were also bequests to servants and friends, and &pound;40 &#145;to be bestowed in dedes of charitie&#146;. Peckham died on 29 March 1564 and was buried in Denham church on 18 April.<br>
