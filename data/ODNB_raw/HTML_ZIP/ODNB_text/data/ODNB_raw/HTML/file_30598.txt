<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barlow,  William Henry</span>  (1812&#150;1902), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 10 May 1812 at Woolwich, London, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1435/', "Peter Barlow (1776&#150;1862)")</script>, mathematician and physicist, of the Royal Military Academy. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1436/', "Peter William Barlow (1809&#150;1885)")</script>. Following private schooling, at the age of sixteen he studied civil engineering with his father for a year. He then began three years' engineering pupillage, initially in the machinery department at Woolwich Dockyard, and subsequently at London docks under the civil engineer Henry Robinson Palmer (1795&#150;1844). In the spring of 1832, when he was still only twenty, he went to Constantinople on behalf of the firm of Maudslay, Sons and Field to install equipment for recasting and reboring Turkish ordnance.<br>
<br>Barlow remained in Turkey for six years, erecting a large structure to house the boring equipment, and reporting for the Turkish government on the lighthouses at the mouth of the Bosphorus. This work led to his first scientific papers, &#145;Experiments made at Constantinople on Drummond's light&#146;  (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 8, 1836, 238&#150;42) and &#145;The adaptation of different modes of illuminating lighthouses as depending on their situations and the object contemplated in their erection&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 127, 1837, 211&#150;16). There was to be a steady stream of papers for the remainder of Barlow's career. For his work in Turkey Barlow was made a member of the Nishan Iftikhar.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1838 Barlow was appointed assistant to G. W. Buck on the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. On its completion in 1842 he became resident engineer on the Midland Counties Railway on the section between Rugby and Derby, retaining a similar position on the Midland Railway when it was incorporated in 1844. Barlow's links with this ambitious company were to enable him to emerge as one of the most important civil engineers of the nineteenth century. The Midland rapidly expanded its network and Barlow became its chief engineer. He developed the wrought-iron saddleback rail (patent 12438, 1849), which became known as the Barlow rail and was widely used, particularly on the Great Western Railway. He described this in his paper on the construction of the permanent way of railways  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 9, 1849, 387). Barlow had been elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) on 1 April 1845, contributing his first paper, also concerned with permanent way, the same year.<br>
<br>In 1857 Barlow removed from Derby to 19 Great George Street, Westminster, setting up as a consulting engineer; and it was in subsequent years that he undertook his most significant projects. As consultant to the Midland Railway Company he was responsible for the southern section of its extension from Bedford to London (1862&#150;9). This work included the 240 ft span St Pancras Station roof, the largest in the world at the time of its construction, and a structure that was pioneering in its abandonment of crescent trusses or other external bracing as a means of stiffening the arch ribs. Barlow was helped in its design by R. M. Ordish (1824&#150;1868). It was one of the triumphs of Victorian structural engineering.<br>
<br>Barlow was involved as a consultant with a number of other outstanding structures. He had helped Sir Joseph Paxton with his calculations of the strengths of columns and girders for the Great Exhibition building. Following the demolition of the Hungerford suspension bridge in 1861 Barlow was appointed with John Hawkshaw (1811&#150;1891) as joint engineer for a scheme to complete I. K. Brunel's proposed Clifton suspension bridge, which with a span of 702 ft was the largest in the country at the time. Barlow described the bridge in his paper to the ICE  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 26, 1867, 243).<br>
<br>Following the failure of the Tay Bridge in December 1879 Barlow was appointed to the Board of Trade's commission of inquiry, one of the results of which was to recommend an investigation of wind pressure on railway structures. Barlow was appointed to the consequent Board of Trade committee which recommended inclusion of an allowance (of 56 lb per square foot) for wind pressure for the first time in the Board of Trade requirements for railway structures. The North British Railway Company appointed Barlow the engineer for the replacement Tay Bridge, the construction of which was entrusted to Barlow's second son, Crawford Peter Barlow (<i>d</i>. 1920), who was his partner from 1874.<br>
<br>In the wake of the Tay Bridge failure work had been suspended on the proposed Forth railway bridge, and Barlow, as consultant to the Midland Railway, was asked, along with John Fowler (1817&#150;1898) and Thomas Elliott Harrison (1808&#150;1888), the engineers to the other railway companies involved, to report on a suitable design for the crossing. Barlow was also consulted about Dufferin Bridge over the Ganges at Benares in 1880, and the Hawkesbury river bridge in New South Wales in 1885.<br>
<br>Alongside his design work Barlow pursued a series of scientific investigations. While in charge of the Midland's electric telegraph system he observed spontaneous deflections of the needles of the telegraph instruments and the effects of magnetic storms, and concluded that there were electric currents on the earth's surface (<span class="italic">Notices and Abstracts of Communications to the British Association for the Advancement of Science</span>, 1848, 2.21&#150;2; <span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 139, 1849, 61&#150;72). In the 1870s he became interested in recording the sound of the human voice, developing the logograph, which recorded sound waves graphically (<span class="italic">PRS</span>, 22, 1874, 277&#150;86; Royal Dublin Society, <span class="italic">Scientific Proceedings</span>, 2, 1880, 153&#150;72).<br>
<br>Barlow also investigated a range of structural problems typically faced by the engineers of the day. His first report, &#145;The existence, practically, of the line of equal horizontal thrust in arches, and the mode of determining it by geometrical construction&#146;  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 5, 1846, 162), was sceptically received by engineers such as Robert Stephenson as being of little practical assistance in design. It was, however, theoretically sound. In 1857 Barlow comprehensively revised G. W. Buck's classic work, <span class="italic">Oblique Bridges</span>, first published in 1839.<br>
<br>In recognition of this scientific research, Barlow was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 6 June 1850. He also served as president of the ICE in 1879&#150;80, and in his presidential address stressed the importance of study and experimental research, referring to his father's experiments on beams. He had himself undertaken work in this field in the 1850s, writing several papers on what he described as the &#145;resistance of flexure&#146; (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 145, 1855, 225&#150;42; <span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 147, 1857, 463&#150;8). This work included an investigation into continuous girders, which led to his patent 908 of 1859, which described girders continuous over piers, where they had their greatest depth. This was, in essence, the principle followed in the Forth railway bridge design. His final paper on beams was published in 1870  (<span class="italic">PRS</span>, 18, 1869&#150;70, 345&#150;7).<br>
<br>From 1858, when he had begun testing steel at Woolwich arsenal, Barlow supported its use by engineers. He was a member of the committee of civil engineers formed in 1868 to conduct further tests. Following his presidential address to the mechanical section of the British Association in 1873 urging the adoption of steel he was appointed to a Board of Trade committee of inquiry. In 1877 this recommended for the first time a safe level of working stress for the use of steel in railway structures.<br>
<br>Barlow married Selina Crawford Caffin, the daughter of W. Caffin who worked in Woolwich arsenal, but the date is unknown. Of their four sons and two daughters only Crawford became a civil engineer. He and his father worked as W. H. Barlow &amp; Son from 2 Old Palace Yard, Westminster, until 1891 when they removed to 53 Victoria Street. They both retired in August 1896. Barlow's own health had been in decline for a number of years and in 1888 he had been obliged to withdraw from the ordnance committee, of which he had been one of the original civil members, owing to ill health. Widely respected in his profession, he was an honorary member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Ing&eacute;nieurs Civils de France, and a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Society of Arts. Barlow died of exhaustion, following a fracture of the femur, at his house, High Combe, Old Charlton, Kent, on 12 November 1902.<br>
