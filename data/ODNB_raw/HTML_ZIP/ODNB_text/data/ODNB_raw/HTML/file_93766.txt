<span class="headword">Lee,  Anna</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Joan Boniface Winnifrith]</span>  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born Joan Boniface Winnifrith at The Rectory, Ightham, Malling, Kent, on 2 January 1913, the daughter of Bertram Thomas Winnifrith, rector of St Peter's Church, Ightham, and his wife, Edith Maude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blaker. Her father ran a small local school at which she was the only girl. She was one of five children; one brother was Sir John Winnifrith (1908&#150;1993), director of the National Trust. From an early age she enjoyed &#145;showing off&#146;, as she later said, and fortuitously her godmother was Dame Sybil Thorndike. Some sources also suggest that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a godfather, but as she was later prone to embroider youthful experiences (once claiming to have run away to join a circus) caution is necessary in accepting such information. Certainly she studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama under the renowned Elsie Fogarty, and she toured with the London Repertory Theatre in productions of <span class="italic">The Constant Nymph</span> and <span class="italic">Jane Eyre</span>, now using the professional name of Anna Lee, the constituents of which she later claimed to have derived (for reasons unspecified) from Anna Karenina and Robert E. Lee.<br>
<br>While still at the Central School of Speech and Drama, Anna Lee obtained work as a film extra in &#145;quota quickies&#146;, low-budget productions aimed at satisfying legislation that demanded exhibition of a certain percentage of British-made films, and this was later said to be the reason why she was not invited back to further terms at the school. In any event, she quickly found her way into British films, and by the end of the 1930s she had appeared in seventeen, many of them in leading roles. With her delicate blonde prettiness she was a natural for English-rose types, but she also brought commendable spirit to these roles. Her earliest features&#151;<span class="italic">His Lordship</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Chelsea Life</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Mannequin</span> (1933)&#151;probably no longer exist. In 1934, however, she starred with Jack Hulbert in a spoof outpost-of-empire adventure, <span class="italic">The Camels Are Coming</span>, and, though the film was tiresomely facetious for much of its length, Lee evinced the lively freshness that was to be her hallmark. An associate producer on the film was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76013/', "Robert Edward Stevenson")</script>, whom she married on 6 December 1934 and who directed her in five films later in the decade.<br>
<br>Anna Lee played second string to Jessie Matthews in <span class="italic">First a Girl</span> (1935), showing some real flair for romantic comedy. She was a charming heroine in <span class="italic">O.H.M.S.</span> (1937), for the American director Raoul Walsh, winning the love of John Mills in an entertaining flag-waver, and shone in Walter Forde's version of Edgar Wallace's thriller <span class="italic">The Four Just Men</span> (1939), but unquestionably her most attractive work was in the films she did for Stevenson. She coped gamely with the range of genres typical of his output: in the science-fiction piece <span class="italic">The Man Who Changed His Mind</span> (1936) she registered an authority and narrative importance more usually the prerogative of men in such circumstances; she was a lively, resourceful heroine (unusually lower-class, and even more unusually doing a stretch in gaol) in the largely airborne thriller <span class="italic">Non-Stop New York</span> (1937); and she did what she could with the conventional female lead in <span class="italic">King Solomon's Mines</span> (1937). Her last two films for Stevenson were her best. In <span class="italic">Young Man's Fancy</span> (1939) she was shot out of a cannon onto the lap of a mother-ridden young aristocrat&#151;and into the middle of a wittily abrasive account of the British class system. Lee's Irish accent wavered but not the zest with which she tackled the role. In her last British film for nearly twenty years, <span class="italic">Return to Yesterday</span> (1940), she played the ing&eacute;nue in a seaside repertory company who falls in love with a returned Hollywood idol, imbuing her life lessons with affecting poignancy.<br>
<br>Stevenson was a pacifist and in 1939 he and Lee left for America, where both proved to be in demand. Their marriage ended in 1944 and in the following year she married a pilot, George Stafford. She had substantial roles in <span class="italic">Seven Sinners</span> (1940) with John Wayne and Marlene Dietrich, both of whom became personal friends; in the romantic comedy <span class="italic">My Life with Caroline</span> (1941), opposite Ronald Colman; and most memorably as Bronwyn in John Ford's <span class="italic">How Green Was My Valley</span> (1941). Ford used her in seven more films, including <span class="italic">Fort Apache</span> (1948), as graceful mentor to Shirley Temple, her one further British film, <span class="italic">Gideon's Day</span> (1958), in which she provides domestic relief for her harassed, police-inspector husband, Jack Hawkins, and <span class="italic">Horse Soldiers</span> (1959), in which she has a heart-stopping moment as the widowed mother trying to restrain her remaining son from going off to fight in the American Civil War. Perhaps, though, her best Hollywood leading role was in <span class="italic">Bedlam</span> (1946) as the fiery actress who ends up in the nightmare of the eponymous asylum.<br>
<br>Lee's second marriage was dissolved in 1964 and in 1970 she married the novelist and poet Robert Nathan (1894&#150;1985). In her last decades she won her biggest following as the matriarch Lila Quartermaine in the long-running soap <span class="italic">General Hospital</span>, playing the role in a wheelchair after she was injured in a serious car accident. Largely in response to her popularity in this she was honoured in 1995 by having her star installed on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. She always retained her love of England, was famous for bringing a &#145;hunk of England to California&#146;  (Morley, 4), and in 1982 was appointed MBE for her work in support of the National Trust. She died in Los Angeles on 14 May 2004 and was survived by four of her five children, including the actress Venetia Stevenson (<i>b</i>. 1938) and the actor Jeffrey Byron (<i>b</i>. 1955).<br>
