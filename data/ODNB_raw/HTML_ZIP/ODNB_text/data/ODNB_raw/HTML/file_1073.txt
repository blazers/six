<span class="headword">Baillie,  William</span>  (1723&#150;1810), <span class="occ">art dealer and printmaker</span>, was born on 5 June 1723 at Kilbride, co. Carlow, Ireland, the second son of Robert Baillie of Celbridge. He was educated in Dublin by Dr Thomas Sheridan, who kept a school at King's Mint House, Capel Street; he then went to London and entered the Middle Temple on 10 May 1742. Baillie soon exchanged his study of law for a commission in the army; he fought with the 13th foot at Culloden and in several engagements in Germany. In 1756 he was captain of grenadiers in the 51st foot at Minden. In 1761 he exchanged into the cavalry, but retired in 1761 with the rank of captain in the 18th light dragoons. In 1773 he was appointed a commissioner of stamps, probably a sinecure with light duties.<br>
<br>Both before and after leaving the army Baillie bought, sold, collected, and created art. With the Irish painter Nathaniel Hone he assisted in the formation of Lord Bute's collection and he himself owned a number of old-master paintings that were engraved by various artists, including himself. Baillie had made prints from at least 1753, when he etched his own painting of a grenadier, one of several military portraits and scenes, and he devoted more time to printmaking after leaving the army. In May 1769, when bound sets were advertised for sale, his output extended to forty-seven prints with three more in hand. Only thirty-five complete sets were available because the early plates had been destroyed after a small edition had been printed. The sets were bought by the printseller Walter Shropshire, who advertised in June a list of about thirty prints by Baillie that he had for sale singly. Baillie's specialization was the imitation of old-master drawings and prints, and through the intimate knowledge of the style and techniques of the masters that he proved in this way he acquired a reputation as a connoisseur. He employed a variety of printmaking techniques and, like other printmakers of the day, improvised when attempting to imitate drawings. He exhibited with the Society of Artists as an honorary exhibitor from 1762 until 1776, and was elected an honorary fellow, although his status as an amateur was not universally acknowledged. Both Horace Walpole and Richard Bull excluded his work from their collections of amateur productions because they considered him a professional, and it is true that when marketing his prints he missed very few tricks. He worked after a variety of Italian, Flemish, and Dutch masters but preferred Ostade, Douw, and especially the highly fashionable Rembrandt. One habit that he copied from Rembrandt was that master's trick of altering his plates each time that he retouched them so as to produce different effects. Baillie liked also to add a touch of drama so that his imitation of Rembrandt's <span class="italic">Three Trees</span>, only slightly caricatured in the first two versions, has a fork of lightning added to the stormy sky in the third and a second fork for good measure in the last. He even managed to acquire three of Rembrandt's original plates: <span class="italic">Cornelis Anslo, Preacher</span>, <span class="italic">Jan Uytenbogaert, Goldweigher</span>, and <span class="italic">The Hundred Guilder Print</span>. His most famous, or notorious, achievement was his &#145;improvement&#146; of <span class="italic">The Hundred Guilder Print</span>, which he bought from the American auctioneer John Greenwood, who had acquired it in Holland. As Baillie demonstrated by exhibiting an impression that he had printed, the plate was so badly worn as to be a pale ghost of its former self. In 1775 Baillie reworked the print and then launched a subscription, proposing to sell impressions to subscribers for 4 guineas each, double what Thomas Worlidge had charged for his copy of the <span class="italic">Hundred Guilder Print</span> (1757) and the highest price yet asked in England for any new publication.<br>
<br>By 1803 Boydell was selling Baillie's complete works as 113 prints in two volumes, with impressions from the three Rembrandt plates thrown in. Opinions of Baillie's work varied dramatically. J. T. Smith, who considered Baillie and his friend Hone both &#145;swaggering fellows&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Nollekens</span>, 2nd edn, 1.119), thought his <span class="italic">Hundred Guilder Print</span> &#145;execrable&#146; and wrote that for years Baillie &#145;amused himself in what he called <i>etching</i>; but in what Rembrandt, as well as every true artist, would call scratching. He could not draw, nor had he an eye for effect&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Book for a Rainy Day</span>, 115). This was harsh criticism, for much of Baillie's work was innovative and skilful and caught the spirit of the original, but it was stimulated by contemporary adulation for Baillie's work that was equally exaggerated. Baillie died at his home in Lisson Grove, Paddington, Middlesex, on 22 December 1810. His sizeable estate, with houses in London at Lisson Grove, Berkeley Street, the New Road, and Queen Anne Street East, was distributed among his wife, Elizabeth, and four children: George, Thomas, Phillippa, and Caroline. His own collections of pictures, engravings, drawings, and books were sold at Christies on 15&#150;16 March 1811.<br>
