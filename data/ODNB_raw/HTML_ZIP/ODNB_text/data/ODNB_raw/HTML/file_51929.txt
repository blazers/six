<span class="headword">Rowles,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1777, <em>d.</em> 1840), <span class="occ">builder</span>, was baptized on 8 December 1777 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, the son of James Rowles and his wife, Catherine (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Holland), the favourite sister of the architect Henry Holland. He was trained in Holland's office but then entered business as a builder. Presumably his family contacts stood him in good stead.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1807 Rowles married Adelaide Theresa Georgiana Gourdez at St George's, Hanover Square. Henry Holland had leased to him the sites of twenty-one houses in Upper Cadogan Place on the Holland Park estate in west London; the largest of these houses, at the east end of the street, became Rowles's own residence. At about this time Rowles entered into a partnership with his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49436/', "Alexander Copland")</script>, one of the most successful of the early building contractors, and from 1811 the two men were responsible for developing part of the Tothill Fields estate belonging to the dean and chapter of Westminster Abbey. In parallel with this work Rowles entered into several major contracts on his own account. These included a saltpetre warehouse on south quay at the East India docks (1806)&#151;Henry Holland had completed the company's headquarters in Leadenhall Street; the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (1811), one of the first examples of a contract in gross; and the Royal Mint (1818), where Rowles was the office of works contractor for the masonry, bricklaying, and carpentry work. An estimate by Rowles dated 1807 for undertaking all the building work at East India College, Haileybury, survives in the Soane Museum, London.<br>
<br>About 1821 Rowles withdrew from the building industry altogether. He subsequently became a director of several dock, railway, and other companies, including the Globe Fire Insurance Company (of which he was chairman), St Katharine's Dock, and the Rhymni ironworks. He served as managing director of the latter until his death: the ironworks was established in 1837 as successor to the Bute ironworks and its first chairman was W. J. Copland, which suggests that the earlier business connection still endured.<br>
<br>Rowles was one of the principal witnesses examined by the 1828 select committee on the office of works. He and another witness, William Cubitt, were described as two of the principal London general builders. In his evidence Rowles was generally critical of the method of pricing works for government contracts by &#145;measure and value&#146; and strongly advocated contracts in gross as more advantageous to the employer. He commented that this system was &#145;very generally used now; I believe almost every new club house in London is built on the same principle&#146;  (Satoh, 38).<br>
<br>Rowles inherited all Henry Holland's architectural books and papers and his collection of antiquities. Many of the latter found their way into Sir John Soane's collection. The two men were on cordial terms and it seems likely that Rowles made Soane a present of the antiquities. In low spirits in later life, Rowles was found dead in the water closet of his home, 15 Stratton Street, Piccadilly, London, on 23 October 1840, having on that evening blown his brains out with a double-barrelled gun. He was buried on 27 October at Kensal Green.<br>
