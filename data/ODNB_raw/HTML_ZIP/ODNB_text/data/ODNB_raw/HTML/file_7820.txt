<span class="headword">Donne,  John, the younger</span>  (1604&#150;1662/3), <span class="occ">author and literary executor</span>, was born about May 1604, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7819/', "John Donne (1572&#150;1631)")</script>, poet and dean of St Paul's, and his wife, Ann More. He was educated at Westminster School, and proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1622, where he took the degrees of BA and MA. It is usually assumed that he was the John Donne who married Mary Staples at Camberwell on 27 March 1627.<br>
<br>Apart from being the son and literary executor of John Donne, Donne is remembered principally for an incident that took place on 31 October 1633 at St Aldates, Oxford, when he struck with his riding whip an eight-year-old boy who had startled his horse. The boy died on 22 November and Donne was put on trial for manslaughter under Laud, who was vice-chancellor at the time, but was acquitted, as two surgeons and a physician attested that they could not find any appearance of injury on the boy. Donne left for Padua after this and took the degree of doctor of laws there, and on his return was incorporated at Oxford with the same degree in 1638. He was ordained priest about this time and was presented to the living of High Roding, Essex, that year, and also concurrently to Ufford in Northamptonshire and Fulbeck in Lincolnshire in May and June respectively the following year. He resided at none of them. He was chaplain to Basil, earl of Denbigh, and during the rising of 1644 was under suspicion by the parliamentary party. In 1662, only months before his death, he published a small volume entitled <span class="italic">Donnes Satyr</span>, which revealed his fondness for witticisms and for playing the fool.<br>
<br>As early as 1637 Donne had petitioned for control of his father's estate and complained to the archbishop of Canterbury about Marriot's editions of Donne's works. He finally acquired Donne's letters, which had been left to Henry King in his will, from Izaak Walton, who was consulting them in the process of writing Donne's biography. That Walton had not consented to the acquisition is suggested by a letter of King to Walton (dated &#145;Novem. 17 1664&#146; and printed as a preface to the 1670 and 1675 editions of Walton's <span class="italic">Life of John Donne</span>), in which he comments:<blockquote>How these were got out of my hands, you, who were the Messenger for them, and how lost both to me and your self, is not now seasonable to complain: but, since they did miscarry, I am glad that the general Demonstration of his Worth was so fairly preserved, and represented to the World by your Pen in the History of his Life.</blockquote>Donne the younger, it seems, had acquired his father's letters despite King's desire to hold on to them. Recent scholarship has traced the course of this dispute and has suggested that, despite the acrimony, Donne and Izaak Walton worked together to some extent to assemble the volumes <span class="italic">Letters to Severall Persons of Honour: Written by John Donne Sometime Deane of St Pauls London</span> (1651) and <span class="italic">A Collection of Letters, Made by Sr Tobie Mathews Kt.</span> (1660). However, Donne's editorial methods in the first of these volumes are far from transparent or honest. As Bennett and Shapiro showed, apart from printing the letters out of chronological order and without their dates, Donne also gave many false addresses and substituted for the names or initials of his father's ordinary friends, including Sir Henry Goodyer, others suggestive of grander associations.<br>
<br>In 1644 Donne the younger was also involved in the publication of his father's treatise on suicide, <span class="italic">Biathanatos</span>. Caught between his father's injunction that the manuscript should be spared &#145;both the Presse and the Fire&#146;, Donne the younger eventually opted for publication, rather than the deliberate annihilation of the fire or the accidental damage of time and chance, remarking that the work was in equal danger of being &#145;utterly lost&#146; and &#145;utterly found&#146;.<br>
<br>Although Anthony Wood's comment that he was an &#145;atheistical buffoon, a banterer, and a person of over-free thoughts&#146; has often been used to characterize the younger Donne, it seems fairer, given the pressures of his father's fame and the complicated situations of his literary executorship, to remember him by Wood's more balanced observation, that &#145;there is no doubt but that he was a man of sense, and parts; which, had they been applied to a good use, he might have proved beneficial in his generation&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.503). In his will (dated 21 July 1657) Donne went some way towards setting his life in order: he returned to Izaak Walton's son some of his father's books and papers; he ordered that he wished to be buried plainly&#151;&#145;I have not lived by juggling &hellip; therefore I desire to dye and be buried without any&#146;; and, somewhat ironically, considering his own actions, warned his executor against interpreting his Spartan wishes too freely. Donne the younger died in the winter of 1662&#150;3 at his London house in Covent Garden and was buried on 3 February 1663 at the west end of St Paul's Church there.<br>
