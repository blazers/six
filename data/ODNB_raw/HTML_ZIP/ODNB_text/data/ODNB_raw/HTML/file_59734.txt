<span class="headword">Harrison,  George Henry</span>  (1816&#150;1846), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Liverpool, the second son in the family of twelve children of William Harrison (<i>d</i>. 1861), businessman, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12440/', "Mary Harrison (1788&#150;1875)")</script>, a flower painter, daughter of William Rossiter of Stockport. He was baptized at St Peter's Church, Liverpool, on 23 January 1823, as too was his brother <a href="#cosubject_59734">Robert [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12459/', "William Frederick Harrison (1815&#150;1880)")</script>, was also a painter. In 1830 he moved with his mother to London, where he studied anatomy at the Hunterian School in Windmill Street, while earning a living making anatomical drawings. Encouraged by John Constable, Harrison began to paint watercolour landscapes, and was one of many artists who went to the Farne Islands in 1838 to paint Grace Darling and the wreck of the <i>Forfarshire</i>; an engraving of his painting is in the British Museum. He exhibited fourteen paintings at the Royal Academy from 1840, and was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1845. Harrison gave weekly outdoor sketching classes during the summer months, and when the family moved to Paris for the sake of his health he gave similar classes there. Many of his later paintings are of the palaces and gardens of Fontainebleau and St Cloud, in the style of Watteau and Boucher, including <span class="italic">Fontainebleau, in the Days of Henri quatre</span> (exh. Society of Painters in Water Colours, 1846). He also painted a number of scenes of Gypsies, such as <span class="italic">Gypsy Children</span> (exh. Suffolk Street, 1836). Two of his watercolours are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. His sketch of Hinchinbrook House, Huntingdonshire, was engraved for S. C. Hall's <span class="italic">The Baronial Halls and Picturesque Edifices of England</span> (1848). Harrison died in Paris on 20 October 1846, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Harrison's younger brother <a name="cosubject_59734"></a><span class="headword">Robert Harrison</span>  (1820&#150;1897), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born on 26 November 1820 in Liverpool. He worked for a bookseller in High Holborn, London, before moving to Paris, and from there to St Petersburg in 1844, where he spent nine years as tutor to the family of Prince Demidov, and as a lecturer at St Anne's School. He married in Russia, but brought his family back to England before the outbreak of the Crimean War, and later published <span class="italic">Notes of a Nine Years' Residence in Russia, 1844&#150;1853</span> (1855).<br>
<br>Robert Harrison was librarian of the Leeds Library from 1854 to 1857, before his appointment as librarian of the London Library. He remained there until his retirement in 1893, and was responsible for the fifth edition of the catalogue (1888), with a preface on the history of the library. One of the founders of the Library Association in 1877, he served as treasurer until 1889, sat on several committees, and contributed papers to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, including &#145;On the elimination of useless books from libraries&#146; (1881). He was elected president for 1891&#150;2.<br>
<br>Harrison wrote ninety articles for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> between 1885 and 1891 for the editor, Leslie Stephen, who was to succeed Tennyson as president of the London Library in 1892. He also helped Sir Henry Montague Hozier with <span class="italic">The Franco-Prussian War</span> (1870&#150;72), wrote, with Joseph Gostwick, <span class="italic">Outlines of German Literature</span> (1873), and translated Alfred von Reumont's <span class="italic">Lorenzo de Medici the Magnificent</span> in 1876. Robert Harrison died on 4 January 1897 at his home in Christchurch Avenue, Brondesbury, Middlesex, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 8 January.<br>
