<span class="headword">Torr,  William</span>  (1808&#150;1874), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born on 22 December 1808, one of at least two sons of a yeoman family which had been settled for several generations at Riby in north Lincolnshire. His education was interfered with by a severe strain affecting the spine while pole-jumping, and he gave up plans to study law. He left school at sixteen and travelled through various parts of Great Britain and the continent.<br>
<br>Torr began farming in his native parish of Riby in 1833. In 1848 he moved to Aylesby Manor Farm, which had been well known for eighty years for its breed of Leicester sheep. Its reputation was successfully maintained and increased under Torr's management. Animals from the Aylesby flocks and herds were sent to all parts of the United Kingdom and to the continent, the colonies, and even Japan. In 1854 Torr also took a farm of 420 acres at Rothwell. In 1856 he succeeded his uncle in the occupation of the Riby Grove farm. The total area of his three farms was over 2400 acres, most of which had been rented by his family for 150 years. He managed all three farms himself.<br>
<br>The main feature of Torr's farms consisted in his magnificent breeds of livestock. He was especially proud of his flock of Leicester sheep, direct descendants of Robert Bakewell's original Leicester. He had also a stud of thoroughbred ponies, which had been bred at Riby since 1804. But what gives Torr's name its importance in the history of agriculture was his famous breed of shorthorn cattle, carefully bred over a thirty-year period. Torr began to lay the foundations of his herd in 1844, hiring bulls from Richard Booth of Worlaby, another famous shorthorn breeder of the time. After his death 84 animals, from stock bred (for several generations) on his farm, were sold, in the presence of about 3000 people, for a total of &pound;42,919 16<i>s</i>. This sale resulted in the scattering of Torr's herd over the whole of the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>Torr acquired a well-deserved reputation as an agriculturist, and was widely in demand as a judge of livestock at agricultural shows. He became a member of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1839, and continued to be closely connected with it throughout his life. In May 1857 he was elected to the council. He was a regular member of the inspection committee appointed to visit the sites offered for the annual country meetings, and he was one of the judges of farms in the first competition carried out under the auspices of the society in connection with the Oxford meeting of 1870. Torr was also an active member and trustee of the Smithfield Club, as well as honorary director of the Lincolnshire Agricultural Society, and a member of the Highland Agricultural Society.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of cattle plague in 1865, Torr gave expert evidence to select committees of the House of Commons on the various ways of transporting live cattle and dead meat. He also invented many improvements in the details of farm management, and designed one of the first convex mould-board ploughs, a farm gate (which won a prize at the Warwick meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1859), a spring wagon, and a pig trough. Torr died at Aylesby Manor on 12 December 1874, and was buried in Riby churchyard.<br>
