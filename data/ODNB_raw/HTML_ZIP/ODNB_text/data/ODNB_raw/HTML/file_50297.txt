<span class="headword">Kinnaird,  Arthur Fitzgerald</span>, eleventh Lord Kinnaird of Inchture and third Baron Kinnaird of Rossie  (1847&#150;1923), <span class="occ">footballer and philanthropist</span>, was born in London on 16 February 1847, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15631/', "Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird, tenth Lord Kinnaird of Inchture and second Baron Kinnaird of Rossie (1814&#150;1887)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15636/', "Mary Jane, n&#233;e Hoare, Lady Kinnaird (1816&#150;1888)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50783/', "Emily Kinnaird")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15636/', "Kinnaird, Mary Jane")</script>] was the youngest of his six sisters. After preparatory school at Cheam, Kinnaird went to Eton College in October 1861, precisely when football was first being developed as an organized sport in the leading schools. He clearly had an aptitude for several sports&#151;he was a fine runner, swimmer, and cricketer, and later represented Cambridge University at tennis&#151;but it was on the football field that he truly excelled. By the time he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1865 he had acquired a zeal both to play and to spread the game. Before he graduated in 1869 he had already been elected as the Old Etonians' representative on the Football Association (FA) committee.<br>
<br>On going down from Cambridge in 1869, Kinnaird began his banking career, becoming a partner in the West End firm Ransom, Bouverie &amp; Co., in which the Kinnaird family had been involved since the eighteenth century. He remained a partner when the bank became part of Barclay, Bevan, Tritton &amp; Co. in 1888. When further amalgamations led to the establishment of Barclays Bank Ltd in 1896, Kinnaird became a director, as well as principal director of the local head office in Pall Mall, which was later named in his honour. He retained these banking appointments until his death.<br>
<br>While in London Kinnaird began his work for voluntary associations, inspired by the example of his parents and of his father's friend Lord Shaftesbury. He taught in ragged schools in the poorer parts of London and visited India, principally to see the hospitals and missions that his mother, a founder of the Foreign Evangelisation Society, had helped to establish. He was a founder of the Boys' Brigade in 1870 and in the same year, with his Etonian friend Quintin Hogg, he established Homes for Working Boys. His work for Christian youth organizations continued a family concern: in 1887 he succeeded his father as president of the YWCA, founded by his mother, and in the same year joined the council of the YMCA, of which he became president in succession to George Williams in 1905. The YMCA's object, he proclaimed in 1908, was &#145;to win young men for Christ&#146;  (Yapp, 27). It was estimated that in total he held some twenty presidencies of voluntary organizations and over forty vice-presidencies and thirty treasurerships. Among the associations enjoying his support were the Church Missionary Society, the London City Mission, the National Rifle Association, the Boy Scouts, and the London Lock Hospital.<br>
<br>On 19 August 1875 Kinnaird married Mary Alma Victoria, daughter of Sir Andrew Agnew, eighth baronet, a Scottish landowner, Liberal MP for Wigtownshire, and a promoter of sabbatarianism. In 1887 Kinnaird succeeded his father to the barony and to the family seat at Rossie Priory, Inchture, Perthshire, with estates amounting to over 17,000 acres. As a Scottish peer of Liberal inclinations and strong evangelical convictions, Kinnaird occasionally spoke in the House of Lords on religious questions, complaining in 1899 of the failure of bishops to halt the spread of ritualism. In 1907 he was appointed by the Liberal government as lord high commissioner to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Kinnaird is best remembered, however, for his key role in the development of association football. As one of the most brilliant of the first generation of public-school footballers, he made his d&eacute;but for Scotland in 1873 and captained Wanderers to victory over Oxford University in the second FA cup final, scoring &#145;a very well-obtained goal&#146; after &#145;a splendid run, outpacing the opposite backs&#146;. His record of FA cup final appearances will probably never be equalled: he played in a total of eleven finals (if two replayed matches are included) and captained the Old Etonians five times and the Wanderers twice. He gained five winners' medals. Known for his skill, stamina, kicking, tackling, and speed, Kinnaird was an easily recognizable and popular figure on the pitch, with his white breeches, quartered cricket cap, and long red beard. He was a noted exponent of &#145;hacking&#146;&#151;the deliberate kicking of an opponent's shins&#151;which was extolled by Kinnaird and some others as crucial to the &#145;manly&#146; character of football. But it was not for the faint-hearted. His mother once told the FA secretary, C. W. Alcock, of her fear that Arthur would one day return with a broken leg. &#145;If he does, it won't be his own&#146;, Alcock replied  (Gibson and Pickford, 3.131).<br>
<br>In the early 1880s Kinnaird played a historic role as player and official (he was elected FA treasurer in 1878) in the transition of the game from a public-school, amateur sport into a popular, professional one. In February 1882 he backed a tough resolution against professionalism. The following month he captained the Old Etonians to FA cup victory over a quasi-professional, northern working-class team, Blackburn Rovers. Kinnaird celebrated by doing a headstand in front of the Kennington Oval pavilion. But in 1883 another Blackburn team finally overcame the Old Etonians, despite another valiant performance by Kinnaird. The age of the public-school team in first-class football was over. With his old Harrovian friend Alcock, Kinnaird was quick to recognize that professionalism could not be wiped out by FA resolutions, and the two men persuaded the FA in 1885 &#145;under stringent conditions&#146; to legalize professionalism. They thus gave English football that distinctive character of professionalism under amateur control which lasted until the 1960s. They also saved football from the social and ethical rupture that rugby was to suffer in 1895.<br>
<br>In 1890 Kinnaird became president of the FA, in succession to Sir Francis Marindin. Although real power on the FA council had shifted towards more bourgeois types, Kinnaird's position as a nobleman, his presence, and his personality helped to develop the game's ties both with the leaders of the political parties and with the monarchy. Lord Rosebery, A. J. Balfour, and the king himself were all guests of honour with Kinnaird at cup finals before the First World War. Such connections did much to protect the game when it came under attack for continuing during the first year of the war. He was justly celebrated for keeping together the aristocratic traditions, and the popular basis, of the national game.<br>
<br>However, the war brought great personal suffering to Kinnaird. His eldest son, Douglas Arthur, was killed in action in the third month of the conflict and another of his sons was killed in 1917. Then, on 20 January 1923, his wife died. She had been guest of honour at the 1895 cup final (whether from personal interest or conjugal duty is not known), and her own active involvement in voluntary concerns shared with her husband suggests that here was a practical as well as emotional partnership. For Kinnaird there was little in life without her: he died at their London home, 10 St James's Square, on 30 January 1923, ten days later.<br>
<br>For Kinnaird, apart from being sheer fun, football had great moral and physical benefits: &#145;I believe that all right-minded people have good reason to thank God for the great progress of this popular national game&#146;, he said late in life  (Young, 155&#150;6). It was simply of a piece with his overall mission in life, his devotion to evangelizing Christianity, to youth, to physical fitness and ideals of manliness and sportsmanship, to the poor, and to his country. His funeral on 2 February 1923 at the Kinnaird family burial-ground at Rossie Priory was attended by bankers, old football colleagues, and representatives of the legion voluntary organizations that owed so much to him. They were perhaps surprised at how much they had in common.<br>
