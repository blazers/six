<span class="headword">Peacock,  James</span>  (1735/1738&#150;1814), <span class="occ">architect and surveyor</span>, was for over forty years assistant clerk of works to the City of London. Nothing is known of his early life, although, according to Sir John Soane, Peacock became acquainted with George Dance the younger soon after Dance's return from Italy in December 1764. From then on the two formed a professional alliance which remained uninterrupted until Peacock's death; their abilities were complementary, with Peacock supplying the skills of surveying and estimating to Dance's abilities as a designer.<br>
<br>In December 1771 Peacock was appointed assistant to Dance, who had succeeded his father as clerk of works to the City of London in 1768, on Dance's recommendation and at his expense, although this arrangement was altered in 1776, when Peacock was given a salary by the corporation of &pound;52 10<i>s</i>. He was also employed by Dance in his private practice. Peacock's only independent work of importance was the stock exchange in Capel Court, which was built to his designs in 1801&#150;2 but reconstructed by Thomas Allason in 1853&#150;4. He also carried out repairs to St Anne and St Agnes, Gresham Street, in 1781&#150;2, and to St Stephen Walbrook in 1803&#150;4.<br>
<br>More remarkable than his architectural works was Peacock's prolific output as an architectural theorist, an inventor, and a social reformer. His architectural publications have a radical, semi-satirical attitude to design and practice. The most important of these was <span class="italic">Oikidia, or, Nutshells</span>, published under the anagrammatic pseudonym of &#145;Jose Mac Packe, bricklayer's labourer&#146; in 1785. At a time of a growing interest in the picturesque and increasingly elaborate exhibition drawings at the Royal Academy, Peacock recommended clients to commission strictly symmetrical plans for small villas with plain fa&ccedil;ades, and scale models complete with furniture instead of drawings and do-it-yourself estimates. These were the &#145;nutshells&#146;: &#145;the first and elementary principles of design&#146;  (p. 2). He repeated his mainly mathematical approach to architecture in his final publication, <span class="italic">Subordinates in Architecture</span> (1814). The anonymous <span class="italic">Essay on the Qualifications and Duties of an Architect</span>, published in 1773, may also have been by Peacock  (Harris, 366&#150;7). As an inventor he published <span class="italic">A Short Account of a New Method of Filtration by Ascent</span> in 1793, promising Londoners an inexhaustible supply of pure soft water from the Thames and neighbouring rivers.<br>
<br>Peacock was also interested in economic and social problems, and wrote a number of short treatises on these subjects. His <span class="italic">Outlines of a scheme for the general relief, instruction, employment, and maintenance of the poor</span> was published in 1777 and is described by him as &#145;an imperfect and crude performance&#146; in another tract entitled <span class="italic">Proposals for a Magnificent and Interesting Establishment</span> (1790). In 1789 he published <span class="italic">Superior Politics</span> and in 1798 <span class="italic">The Outlines of a Plan for Establishing a United Company of British Manufacturers</span>. All of these tracts set forth, with various modifications, Peacock's main project of:<blockquote>giving protection and suitable incitement, encouragement, and employ to every class of the destitute, ignorant, and idle poor who shall be healthy, able to work, and willing to conform &hellip; to such &hellip; regulations as the company shall enact, and which are intended to be of mutual benefit and advantage to the company and the workpeople, and eventually so to society at large.</blockquote>Peacock died on 22 February 1814 at 17 Finsbury Square, a house where he had lived for some years and &#145;which he apparently built for himself&#146;  (Papworth). His former residence was at Coleman Street Buildings. Little is known of his personality but in his edition of Chambers's <span class="italic">Treatise on Civil Architecture</span> (1875) Joseph Gwilt paid a tribute to Peacock's &#145;virtues and moral excellence&#146;, which &#145;will be honoured as long as the memory of his surviving friends remains sound&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 745). He was buried in the back cemetery of St Luke's, Old Street, where his headstone (now demolished) records that he died &#145;in the seventy-sixth year of his age&#146;  (Papworth), although according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, he was in his seventy-ninth year.<br>
