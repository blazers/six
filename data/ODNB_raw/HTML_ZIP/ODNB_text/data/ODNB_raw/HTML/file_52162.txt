<span class="headword">Canigiani <span class="st"> [Caniziani]</span>,  Gherardo</span>  (1424&#150;1484), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Florence, the son of Bernardo di Gherardo Canigiani and his wife, Papera di messer Tommaso Sacchetti. In 1457 he stated that he had a daughter aged twelve named Piera, but nothing is known of his wife. He came to England in 1446 as a factor of the Medici company and probably never returned to Florence. After 1460 he became prominent in the Medici's commercial affairs in England. From 1461 he appears as a lender to the crown and a supplier of textiles to the court. These connections explain why he was used by Edward IV in 1464 as an agent to visit Scotland and distribute bribes to the nobility there. In 1465 the Medici branch in London was reformed by an <i>accomandita</i> designating Canigiani and Giovanni de' Bardi as the managers in London. Canigiani contributed &pound;300 to the capital of the branch. From this time he became increasingly independent and prominent in London business.<br>
<br>A series of large loans were made to Edward IV in Canigiani's name. It is impossible to be certain on each occasion whether he was lending Medici money or his own, but the probability is that he was doing business for the Medici. The main loans were &pound;5354 19<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. in November 1466, &pound;8468 18<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in November 1467, &pound;1000 in August 1468, &pound;2610 9<i>s</i>. in December 1468, &pound;3225 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in January 1469, &pound;6600 in July 1471, and &pound;4566 1<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in March 1474. Between 1466 and 1471 they totalled over &pound;26,000. These loans were at least partially repaid. In 1468 Canigiani received an elaborate jewel in pawn. He was also at the same time involved in more ordinary trading activities, again presumably doing business on behalf of the Medici. Licences to make substantial exports of wool, cloth, and metal to the Mediterranean at this time were doubtless also intended to repay royal debts. There are documents which show him exporting wool and tin and importing pepper and madder. In 1468 Canigiani advanced money for the payment of the dowry of Margaret of York when she was married to Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy. It is therefore uncertain whether he was making an overall profit for the Medici, and whether the loans to Edward IV were necessary in order to secure privileges for trade and further business. Lorenzo de' Medici took over control of the Medici position at Florence and its banks elsewhere in Europe in 1469. In 1468 another Medici representative, Angelo Tani, had been sent to London by Piero de' Medici, Lorenzo's father, and had expressed disquiet at the large sums lent to the crown and the slow repayment of them. Lorenzo expressed disquiet himself in 1470, and two years later sent Cristofano Spini to London with instructions to encourage Tommaso Portinari, the Medici manager in Bruges, to keep control of the London business.<br>
<br>Canigiani was probably removed from the Medici branch in 1473. The main cause of the sacking may have been Spini's hostile criticism; it is clear that the two men became bitter enemies. Another consideration may have been the disaster which occurred in April 1473, when a galley loaded with Medici goods on its way from Zeeland to Southampton and Pisa was captured by pirates from Danzig. Canigiani attempted to reduce the damage by sending large numbers of cloths to be exported in the accompanying galley, which managed to reach Southampton. But he was replaced as Medici representative in London by Tommaso Guidetti.<br>
<br>Perhaps in response to Medici disapproval, Canigiani secured denization on 3 November 1473. By January 1474 he was already married to Elizabeth, widow of Sir John Stockton, with whom he had a son in 1476. He evidently retained the approval of the king. In December 1473 he was granted the position of keeper of the exchange at Calais, jointly with William Hatteclyffe (<i>d</i>. 1480), the king's secretary, for seven years, and this was renewed for four years in 1480. In July 1474 he was granted the manor of Great Linford, Buckinghamshire, and custody of the lands of Alice Lovel. Lorenzo de' Medici's <span class="italic">Promemoria</span> of 1478, a statement about the finances of his company, stated that the losses of his London branch amounted to 78,000 ducats (about &pound;14,000 sterling), but still the Medici continued to do business in London. It is not clear how far Canigiani was responsible for the losses. He died in 1484.<br>
