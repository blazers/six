<span class="headword">Norton,  John</span>  (1606&#150;1663), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was born on 6 May 1606 in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, the son of William Norton and his wife, Alice Browest. As a youth he was tutored by Alexander Strange at Bunningford School, and he matriculated as a pensioner at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1620 at the age of fourteen, graduating BA in 1624 and proceeding MA in 1627, having earned a reputation as an excellent Latinist. Cotton Mather claimed that family financial difficulties prompted him to leave the university rather than continue as a fellow. Mather also reported that as a youth Norton had been addicted to card-playing, but that once chastised for the practice by one of the family servants he henceforth adopted a strong lifelong opposition to the practice. After returning home he accepted a post as usher at the Stortford grammar school and also served as the local curate. Although he was exposed to puritan ideas at Cambridge, it was his attendance to the preaching of Jeremiah Dyke and other local puritans that effected his conversion. Because he was unwilling to compromise his new convictions he turned down a church benefice to become chaplain to Sir William Masham of High Lever, Essex. He likewise declined Richard Sibbes's efforts to procure him a fellowship at St Catharine's College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>After their attempt to leave England in 1634 was thwarted by bad storms, the following year Norton migrated to New England in the company of his wife, about whom nothing is known, and of his fellow clergyman Thomas Shepard. They landed at Plymouth, and he initially preached in that colony before moving to Boston in 1636. There he took a lead in opposing Anne Hutchinson, who preached a mystical apprehension of spiritual election and accused most of the region's clergy, including Norton, of preaching an Arminian-style covenant of works. He was a member of the synod of 1637 which defined religious errors said to be maintained by Hutchinson and her followers, and supported her exile. In 1638 Norton accepted the ministerial post of teacher in the church at Ipswich, Massachusetts, where Nathaniel Rogers was pastor.<br>
<br>In England in 1643 the unity of the puritans in the Westminster assembly splintered when the dissenting brethren issued their <span class="italic">Apologetical Narration</span> calling for toleration within a projected presbyterian settlement for independent congregations of orthodox believers. English congregational Independents such as Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye cited the example of the New England way in defence of congregational polity while the presbyterian majority, led by the assembly's Scottish observers, sought to discredit that position. Among other strategies the presbyterians sought to engage respected continental theologians to write in support of their position. One such important work was produced by William Apollonius, pastor of the church in Middleburg. The congregationalists turned to their New England allies for a response and the colonial clergy selected Norton. His Latin <span class="italic">Responsio ad totam questionum &hellip;</span> (1648) was an answer to Apollonius that was published in London with a preface by Nye, Thomas Goodwin, and Sidrach Simpson. It spelt out in great detail congregational church polity and sought to demonstrate the affinity of congregational practice with continental reformed belief and polity. Like most New Englanders, Norton strongly supported the dissenting brethren but was concerned about the alliance with the sects into which they were forced in the 1640s. As he wrote to the former New Englander Giles Firmin, he thought &#145;better of many Presbyterians&#146; than he did of some of the sects, &#145;for I distinguish between Independents and Congregational men&#146;  (<span class="italic">New England Historical and Genealogical Register</span>, 20, 1886, 229).<br>
<br>With his answer to Apollonius behind him, Norton served in 1648 as a member of the colonial assembly that prepared the Cambridge platform, which expressed the structural character and the faith of the churches of New England. When, prior to the assembly, members of the Boston church questioned whether such an endeavour would interfere with congregational autonomy, Norton preached to that congregation a guest sermon which was credited with gaining their participation. He also wrote to John Durie a letter, signed by forty-three other ministers, which expressed support for that reformer's eirenic efforts to unite Christians.<br>
<br>In 1645 Norton was invited to deliver the election sermon for the colony and was considered as a possible agent to represent Massachusetts in England until that plan was postponed. He came to the assistance of the magistrates in 1650 when one of their number, Springfield's William Pynchon, published <span class="italic">The Meritorious Doctrine of our Redemption</span> (1650), a tract which denied the doctrine that man's sins were imputed to Christ and that the Saviour suffered to redeem them. At the request of the colony's general court Norton wrote and published a refutation of Pynchon's <span class="italic">A Discussion of that Great Point in Divinity, the Sufferings of Christ</span> (1653).<br>
<br>John Cotton was said to have recommended Norton to succeed him as teacher in the First Church of Boston, and following Cotton's death in 1652 the churches of Ipswich and Boston entered into a protracted struggle for his services. After a council of twelve churches intervened the Ipswich congregation relented and Norton was ordained at Boston on 23 July 1656, the New England churches maintaining that ordination was specific to a particular congregation. In 1654 he published <span class="italic">The Orthodox Evangelist</span>, a critical exposition of puritan faith and theology which strongly asserted the inefficacy of man's work in the process of salvation while maintaining that the pietistic love that results from God's election of the saints was expressed within their lives. He also published <span class="italic">A Brief and Excellent Treatise Containing the Doctrine of Godliness</span> (1648), a <span class="italic">Brief Catechism</span> (1660), and a biography of his friend and predecessor John Cotton, <span class="italic">Abel being Dead yet Speaketh</span> (1658). The last work is credited as being the first biography written in America. In 1659 he wrote <span class="italic">The Heart of New England Rent</span>, in which he expounded the threat posed by Quaker missionaries to New England and justified the application of the death penalty to Quakers who defied banishment to return to the colony. Appointed an overseer in 1654 he also devoted attention to the affairs of Harvard College, and in addition he tutored children in his home, the most notable of whom was the young Increase Mather. By 1656 his wife had died, and on 23 July that year he married Mary Mason, who outlived him.<br>
<br>New Englanders had supported the English puritan regimes of the Commonwealth and protectorate and feared the consequences of the restoration of the Stuarts in 1660. Though he continued to urge the prosecution of the puritan errand, Norton's 1661 election sermon, &#145;Sion the Outcast Healed of her Wounds&#146;, called for reconciliation with the crown. Consequently in 1662 Norton and Simon Bradstreet were sent to England by the Massachusetts general court to seek reassurances regarding their charter and to respond to criticism about the colony's harsh treatment of Quakers. While the charter was upheld for the time, the royal government insisted on changes in the Massachusetts franchise, demanded adherence to the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>, and required toleration of dissenters. Norton and Bradstreet were generally blamed by their fellow colonists for conceding too much and their mission was judged a failure. Shortly after returning from England, on 5 April 1663, Norton appeared to suffer a stroke after preaching at the morning service and died that same day; he was buried in the King's Chapel burial-ground, Boston. His contemporary Nathaniel Morton characterized Norton as &#145;singularly endowed with the tongue of the learned, enabled to speak a word in due season&#146; and &#145;not only a wise steward of the things of Christ, but also a wise statesman&#146;  (N. Morton, <span class="italic">New England's Memoriall</span>, 1669).<br>

<a name="cosubject_45775"></a><span class="headword">John Norton</span>  (1651&#150;1716), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was the son of William Norton of Ipswich, Massachusetts, and his wife, Lucy, daughter of Emmanuel Downing (1585&#150;1660) and Lucy Winthrop. He was thus the nephew not only of John Norton but also of George Downing, and great-nephew of Governor John Winthrop. He was a pupil at Ipswich School and then matriculated at Harvard, where he received his BA in 1671. Ordained at Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1678, he became the colleague and then successor of Peter Hobart; his ministry was undistinguished. He published an election sermon, <span class="italic">An Essay Tending to Promote Reformation</span> (1708), and delivered a funeral elegy on Anne Bradstreet. Having proceeded MA from Harvard in 1716, he died in the same year.<br>
