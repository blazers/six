<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Southwell, Sir  Robert</span>  (1635&#150;1702), <span class="occ">diplomat and government official</span>, was born near Kinsale in co. Cork on 31 December 1635, the second but only surviving son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26065/', "Robert Southwell (bap. 1608, d. 1677)")</script> and Helena (1613&#150;1679), daughter of Major Robert Gore, of Shereton, Wiltshire. His father, from the second generation of a family settled in the recently planted province of Munster, had acquired the post of collector of customs in the port of Kinsale in 1631. Even before this Robert Southwell the elder, and his father of the same name, had been accumulating property in and around the town. They continued to add to their holdings in the locality. Southwell the elder, in common with other Munster planters, was endangered by the uprising of 1641 and spent the next decade trying to suppress it. Unlike some protestant leaders in the region, notably Broghill, he looked to the king and his Irish lord lieutenant, Ormond, to end the rebellion. Faithful to the royal cause even after Charles I had been defeated in England, in 1648 Southwell assisted Prince Rupert, who was harrying the victorious parliamentarians at sea. Kinsale was notable as a safe harbour and was also developing as a victualling centre for shipping. Southwell put it at Rupert's disposal, and thereby incurred the hostility of the English authorities.<h2>
<a name="Educationandforeigntravel"></a>Education and foreign travel</h2>Once the formidable army of the new English Commonwealth had disembarked in Ireland in August 1649, royalists among the Irish protestant community were liable to harassment and punishment. It may have been to escape this uncongenial atmosphere that Southwell dispatched his young heir to Christchurch in Hampshire in 1650. Already Robert the younger had received some schooling in the city of Cork. In 1653 the youth matriculated at Queen's College in Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1655. In 1654 Southwell was entered at Lincoln's Inn. Some signs of his versatility were precociously apparent in verses which he wrote between 1654 and 1656. Some celebrated his contemporaries among the undergraduates at Oxford, but one was occasioned by the death of John Selden, &#145;the grave and famous antiquary&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. poet. f.6, fol. 44).<br>
<br>The past affiliations of the elder Robert Southwell in 1654 threatened him with the forfeiture of one-fifth of his Irish holdings. However, he ingratiated himself with the new regime. From 1655, with Henry Cromwell as effective governor, prospects for older established settlers in Ireland brightened. Under this friendlier administration Southwell added to his property in Kinsale, attracted government contracts for provisioning ships, and so improved his finances. As a result, his heir was able to undertake an extended foreign tour. One motive for travelling at this juncture may still have been a wish to avoid too close contact with the usurpers; another, to improve links with the exiled royalists. But the principal purpose seems to have been to educate the promising young man who, as yet, had not chosen a career. Between 1659 and 1661 his travels took in France, the Netherlands, parts of central Europe, and Italy. An obvious result was a facility in languages which would soon be applied in foreign embassies. Welcomed by grandees, Southwell developed and exhibited a courtliness which was much admired. In 1660 he had spent three months in Florence, where he was warmly received by the grand duke and his brother, reviving a contact between the Medicis and Southwells which stretched back to the early sixteenth century and which would be extended in the improbable setting of Kinsale in 1669. In Florence and Bologna he frequented the circles of virtuosi, encountered a pupil of Galileo, and met mathematicians, astronomers, and antiquaries. Southwell followed a similar routine in Rome during 1661. There he counted the scientist Father Athanasius Kircher a particular friend and, on behalf of an acquaintance from Munster, Robert Boyle, questioned the Jesuit closely. He conversed with cardinals and English expatriates, exiled on account of religion and political principles. Among the last was the republican Algernon Sidney. The table talk in Rome ranged widely. It even embraced the attributes&#151;including dissimulation&#151;needed to thrive in state and diplomatic service, which Southwell seems to have heeded. These peregrinations also allowed the traveller to send back to his friends in Ireland and England rarities, from books and artefacts to a Parmesan cheese. It left him with an enthusiasm for the continent which he not only indulged during his own life but which he passed to his descendants. In successive generations the enlightening effects of the grand tour were appreciated.<h2>
<a name="Publicoffice"></a>Public office</h2>Equipped by this protracted preparation, Southwell returned home, there to consider his future. The Restoration had improved the standing of the family. The gains of recent years were likely to be confirmed, and the possible penalties had been averted. The elder Southwell wanted his heir to find a profitable occupation which would keep him in Ireland. The advent of Ormond to the lord lieutenancy made this a realistic ambition, since Ormond was accounted a friend and patron of the Southwells. However, the younger Southwell, uninterested in a military post, doubted that Ormond had anything in his gift which fitted his qualifications. Moreover, he argued that his knowledge of the wider world was more relevant to possible employments in England than in Ireland. The first office which he acquired, in 1664, was a secretaryship to the commission of prizes. This may have come his way thanks to his family's connections, as owners of the docks at Kinsale, with the naval administrators in London. But it also owed something to support from Ormond and his circle.<br>
<br>On 26 January 1665 Southwell married Elizabeth (1649&#150;1682), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37354/', "Sir Edward Dering")</script>, a baronet from Kent. Dering had recently served in Ireland as one of the English commissioners charged with adjudicating on the claims of those who wished to be restored to their confiscated estates. No doubt the opportunity for this alliance arose during Dering's stay in Dublin. With the bride came a portion of &pound;1500. The expectation of the dowry may have enabled Southwell late in 1664 to buy one of the four clerkships of the privy council for &pound;1600 or &pound;2000. The seller was another Irish protestant, Sir George Lane, secretary to Ormond. It was reckoned that a clerk could earn &pound;450 per annum. The office also introduced Southwell into the innermost workings of government. From his vantage point he maintained a watching brief for friends back in Ireland and Dublin University as the new land settlement was drafted. He soon attracted plaudits, being described by Arlington as &#145;an ingenious young gentleman and very well qualified for the employment&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 34336, fols. 1&#150;2). In particular, his linguistic proficiency rapidly brought him more work. In November 1665 he was appointed as emissary to Portugal, with the mission of concluding peace between the Portuguese and Spain. The next month he was knighted. He travelled to Lisbon early in 1666, and helped to bring about the peace of Lisbon, which was signed on 13 February 1668. Soon he was ordered to return to that country, again as envoy. His task was now to negotiate a commercial treaty between England and Portugal. Negotiations detained him for more than a year and left him financially embarrassed. More foreign missions soon followed. In October 1671 he was dispatched to Brussels as ambassador.<br>
<br>Back in England by 1672, Southwell was elected the next year to parliament for the Cornish borough of Penryn, which he represented until 1679. In 1672 he was reappointed secretary to the commission of prizes, having relinquished the post in 1667. Profitable involvement in maritime affairs increased with his being named as deputy to his father as vice-admiral of the province of Munster: no sinecure, but, with its chances to share in the sale of prizes and wrecks, lucrative to the family. In 1677 Southwell succeeded to the vice-admiralty itself following his father's death on 3 April. Another valuable post, a commissioner for the excise, was gained in 1671: it carried a salary of &pound;500 per annum. Throughout the 1670s Southwell distinguished himself as a diligent and adroit administrator. Loyal to the court, he hardly ventured into partisan politics. For much of the decade his original patron, Ormond, was in eclipse, but this did not slow the prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s steady progress. As a result of his greater prosperity and rank, by 1672 he had acquired a property in Spring Gardens in Westminster. By the 1670s he was enquiring what country estates were on offer. Like other purchasers from southern Ireland, he opted for one in south-western England, at King's Weston outside Bristol, handy for rapid movement between Ireland and England. In 1671 he had revisited his ancestral home; his father's death in 1677 obliged him to return to settle affairs in Kinsale. He drew approximately &pound;1000 annually from Irish property, almost all of which was concentrated in the town, and so watched vigilantly over his own and the port's interests. In particular, he used his official connections to urge on the Treasury and Admiralty the claims of Kinsale as the centre where ships could most expeditiously be provisioned. In 1682 he was prepared to lease his little-used house there as a navy office. In addition, he frequently bestirred himself to place the sons of tenants and kinsfolk from the district in the navy or government service. As such he remained a useful patron even after he had permanently absented himself from Ireland.<br>
<br>The furore over the Popish Plot embarrassed Southwell. Although a compliant servant of the administration throughout the 1670s, his Irish upbringing and property in Ireland gave him strong reasons for resisting the demands of the Catholics for better treatment. Yet in 1679 he was criticized in the House of Lords. In connection with his duties as clerk to the council he was reputed to have suppressed pertinent information about the conspiracy. He felt it best to leave the sensitive public post. Seemingly with the help of Ormond (since 1677 back in favour), Southwell was allowed to sell his clerkship in December 1679 for &pound;2500. His choice in the spring of 1680 for an embassy to the elector of Brandenburg showed that he was still highly regarded. The mission was connected with a scheme to construct an alliance against France, and it took Southwell to the prince of Orange and the court of Brunswick&#150;L&uuml;neburg. But such diplomacy was not to the taste of Charles II, moving in the orbit of France. Southwell was soon recalled. In 1681 his place in the excise commission was terminated. He was returned to the 1685 parliament, this time for another Cornish seat, Lostwithiel.<h2>
<a name="Estatesandscholarlyinterests"></a>Estates and scholarly interests</h2>Otherwise, without public employments, Southwell busied himself about private and family matters. King's Weston (bought in 1679) was improved; Kinsale, albeit from a distance, was overseen. Almshouses were endowed and the parish church ornamented with a monument to his parents from the workshop of Grinling Gibbons. The education of his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26060/', "Edward Southwell")</script>, born on 4 September 1671, preoccupied him, the more so as his wife had died in 1682. He attended also to the upbringing of other young kinsmen, the Percevals, Kings, and Sir Thomas Southwell. All were entrusted to the expert Southwell. Also, the ageing Ormond, who was restored to the Irish viceroyalty and held the post from 1677 to 1685, confided much in him. Probably the honorary doctorate of civil law which Southwell received from Oxford University in 1677 had been prompted by Ormond, the chancellor of the university. The management of his errant grandsons, especially the eldest&#151;James Butler, future duke of Ormond&#151;after his father, Lord Ossory, died in 1680, was delegated to Southwell. In 1682, when the duke became embroiled in an acrimonious and potentially damaging controversy with Anglesey, he turned to Southwell to construct a detailed defence of his conduct during the 1640s. The project expanded into an authorized biography. Although Southwell worked on it intermittently between 1682 and 1688, being accorded access to the archives of aristocrats other than Ormond, nothing was published in the lifetime of either the duke or Southwell. The life, eventually published in 1792, showed how the discretion which brought Southwell such respect could be carried to extremes.<br>
<br>Southwell's preferences, always sedentary, increasingly inclined to the cerebral. In 1662, sponsored by his friend Robert Boyle, he had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Absences overseas interfered with his attendance at meetings, but when in London he participated with enthusiasm. Furthermore, a close friendship with the polymath Sir William Petty stimulated an interest in utilitarian improvements and speculations on the natural world. Together they reflected on the demography, topography, and politics of Ireland. It indicated Southwell's tact and self-effacement that he could keep the affection of two such divergent figures as the haughty Ormond and the touchy Petty.<h2>
<a name="Southwellandtherevolutionof16881689"></a>Southwell and the revolution of 1688&#150;1689</h2>These same qualities stood Southwell in good stead during the developing crisis of 1688. Edward Southwell acted more impetuously than his cautious father by joining the forces of William of Orange shortly after they had landed in November 1688. Soon, although an uneasy calm descended on England once William and Mary had been accepted, the danger to protestant proprietors in Ireland, such as Southwell, worsened. James II, indeed, landed at Kinsale on 12 March 1689 at the start of his bid to use Ireland to regain his other two kingdoms. The absent, and those from Ireland who had embraced William, stood to forfeit their properties. Southwell had met William during his mission in 1680 and may covertly have kept in touch thereafter. He readily accepted from William appointment as principal secretary for Ireland. In this office, it seemed, Southwell's intimacy with the country was married to his administrative expertise. He accompanied the king to Ireland, and landed with him at Carrickfergus on 14 June 1690. In the field with William he was primarily concerned with the commissariat, not tactics. However, he may have proposed that William repeat the ploy tried by Cromwell in 1650: to seek to detach the humbler Irish Catholics from their leaders with offers of clemency. It did not succeed. Southwell's secretaryship, important while the kingdom had still to be subdued, occupied its holder less once more conventional rule through lords deputy or lords justices was resumed. He was not long detained in Ireland, being back in London by October 1690. High standing with the new order had also been shown in his appointment, on 19 April 1689, as a commissioner for managing the English customs, a post he held until he relinquished it on 12 June 1697. Further acknowledgement of his standing, and perhaps of his skills as organizer and diplomat, was shown in his election in December 1690 as president of the Royal Society. He was re-elected annually until 1695.<br>
<br>Much in demand for his good sense, Southwell shrewdly advised a nephew, Sir John Percival, about to take possession of his co. Cork estate, how to comport himself. An understanding of men and affairs generally made him treat with equanimity the foibles of his fellows. Yet, having advanced himself largely through his own exertions, he could be sensitive on questions of honour. A Brandenburger, Schwerin, whom&#151;as a favour&#151;Southwell had helped in the supervision of his Monmouthshire estate, provoked Southwell's wrath. Schwerin had accused him of malpractices. Southwell insisted that he had acted honourably, and warned Schwerin that he had &#145;other use of my time and ill health than to serve you and to displease you at once&#146;  (R. Southwell to Baron De Schwerin, 9 Feb 1698[9], Cardiff Central Library, MS 4.11/103). For once, the passionless mask had slipped. Southwell, deferential towards superiors and elders in his early years, once he had climbed to some eminence was himself accorded (and expected) respect and trust. He died at King's Weston on 11 September 1702 and was buried near by in Henbury church in Gloucestershire, where his wife had earlier been interred. He had not severed his links with Ireland, not least because it remained a vital source of remittances. Yet he had transformed himself from Irish protestant to English country gentleman in receipt of about &pound;1000 per annum from Irish property.<br>
