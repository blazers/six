<span class="headword">Service,  John</span>  (1833&#150;1884), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and writer</span>, was born at Campsie, Stirlingshire, on 26 February 1833, son of John Service, print engraver, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clachar. Robert Dalglish MP, the owner of the calico works at which Service's father worked, took an interest in the development of the promising youngster who moved on from Campsie parish school to Glasgow University, where he studied for the ministry. While there he was much influenced by the astronomer John Pringle Nichol. Service worked as editor of the <span class="italic">Dumbarton Herald</span> (1857), and from 1858 to 1862 he was sub-editor of Mackenzie's <span class="italic">Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography</span>. On 29 April 1859 he married Jessie, daughter of James Bayne, a Glasgow music teacher, with whom he had seven children.<br>
<br>Licensed by the presbytery of Glasgow on 12 January 1861, Service was ordained as missionary in the parish of Hamilton, Lanarkshire, in 1862. After ten months his health broke down and he moved to Australia. He was on the point of returning to Scotland when he was persuaded instead to go to Tasmania, where he became minister of St John's Presbyterian Church, Hobart Town. He remained there from 1866 to 1869, before returning to Scotland in May 1870. He was briefly assistant to Charles Strong at Anderston, Glasgow, until he was presented to the parish of Inch, Wigtownshire, where he was admitted on 11 April 1872. Service drew on his Australian experiences in writing a novel, <span class="italic">Lady Hetty</span> (1875), which initially appeared in <span class="italic">Good Words</span> as <span class="italic">Novantia</span>. He attracted attention through a volume of sermons, <span class="italic">Salvation Here and Hereafter</span> (1877), which revealed him as a thoughtful churchman, unusually well attuned to changing popular beliefs. The attention thus aroused led to his translation to the charge of Hyndland, in the west end of Glasgow, to which he was admitted in December 1878. He had been recognized by Glasgow University in the previous year, with the degree of DD. In his time at Hyndland, Service confirmed his growing reputation: as his obituary stated &#145;Though he never attracted great crowds, there was not in all Scotland so fascinating a preacher for a cultured audience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 17 March 1884).<br>
<br>Service was not prominent in church courts or in any other public role but exerted influence through numerous articles in magazines and newspapers, particularly the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>. He was a contributor to the controversial edition of <span class="italic">Scotch Sermons</span> (1880), and wrote an essay on Robert Burns for T. H. Ward's <span class="italic">English Poets</span>. Service died at his home, 6 Spring Gardens, Kelvinside, Glasgow, on 15 March 1884. His wife survived him.<br>
