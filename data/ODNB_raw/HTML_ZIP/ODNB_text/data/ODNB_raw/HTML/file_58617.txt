<span class="headword">Milligan,  Alice Letitia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Iris Olkyrn]</span>  (1866&#150;1953), <span class="occ">author and Irish nationalist</span>, was born on 14 September 1866 at Gortmore, Omagh, co. Tyrone, the third of the thirteen children of Seaton Forest Milligan (1836&#150;1916), managing director, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burns (<i>d</i>. 1916). Her parents were both Irish Methodists, and she had distant Scottish connections on her mother's side.<br>
<br>Alice Milligan's early education at home, followed by secondary instruction at Methodist College, Belfast (1879&#150;86), and a year at the ladies' department of King's College, London, revealed an enquiring mind. Her first published work, <span class="italic">Glimpses of Erin</span> (1888) was written in collaboration with her father, who was a fellow of both the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. Part travelogue, part philosophical reflection on Ireland and the Irish, <span class="italic">Glimpses</span> was well received, and marked the beginning of her lifelong preoccupation with Irish politics and literature. While in Dublin in 1888 to learn Irish she began to take an active interest in politics and was deeply impressed by Charles Stewart Parnell. Parnell's denunciation by the Catholic church following the O'Shea divorce scandal caused Milligan to champion the right of protestants to participate in the national movement, a concern reflected in her novel <span class="italic">A Royal Democrat</span> (1892).<br>
<br>In 1893 Milligan joined the Irish Literary Society and came into contact with key figures of the Gaelic revival. William Butler Yeats encouraged her to write plays and poetry, although he was more enthusiastic of her efforts as a dramatist than as a poet. The years between 1893 and 1916 were Milligan's most productive, in a political and literary sense. In 1895 she and Anna Johnston (whose pseudonym was Ethna Carbery) became founding editors first of the <span class="italic">Northern Patriot</span>, and in 1896 of the <span class="italic">Shan Van Vocht</span>, a seminal newspaper which provided a forum for the varied strands within the Irish nationalist movement. Ostensibly a literary publication, it addressed issues such as the morality of armed resistance, organized socialism, and the use of literature in politics. The final issue appeared in March 1899, when she and Johnston voluntarily halted publication in order to make way for Arthur Griffith's new journal, the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>. Although she was not enthusiastic about the decision, her growing political commitments filled the void.<br>
<br>From 1895 Milligan had been involved in the establishment of the Henry Joy McCracken Literary Society in Belfast, being elected vice-president in August of that year. She was appointed organizing secretary for the 1798 centenary celebrations, and became a member of the Gaelic League, for whom she travelled the country, lecturing and recruiting. 1898 saw the publication of her <span class="italic">Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone</span>. In 1900 her play <span class="italic">The Last Feast of Fianna</span> was produced at the Abbey Theatre, although Yeats rated her <span class="italic">Red Hugh</span> more highly, citing it as the model for his own <span class="italic">Cathleen ni Houlihan</span> in terms of literary propaganda. Her collection of poetry, <span class="italic">Hero Lays</span>, appeared in 1908, and in the years leading up to the war she continued her work for the Gaelic League, despite increasing family disapproval of her political activities, and the family's pressure on her, as the unmarried daughter, to care for her elderly parents. The year 1916 marked a turning point, bringing the death of both her parents and her elder sister, and the trial and execution of Sir Roger Casement, the friend for whom she wrote the eulogistic poem &#145;The Ash Tree of Uisneach&#146;.<br>
<br>Milligan's life after 1916 was one of increasing financial dependence upon her brothers Ernest and William, and she moved between England and Ireland, acting as governess and housekeeper in their homes. In 1932 she returned permanently to Ireland, where she lived in increasing poverty. Despite being awarded an honorary doctorate by the National University of Ireland in 1941, she remained in precarious circumstances. The intervention of friends and family, however, eased the final two years of her life, and she died at Tyrcur, Omagh, co. Tyrone, close to her birthplace, on 13 April 1953. She was buried in Drumragh, Omagh, two days later.<br>
