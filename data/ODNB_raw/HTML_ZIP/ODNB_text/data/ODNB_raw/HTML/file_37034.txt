<span class="headword">Wright, Sir  Charles Theodore Hagberg</span>  (1862&#150;1940), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born at Middleton Tyas, near Richmond, Yorkshire, on 17 November 1862, the third of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37033/', "Charles Henry Hamilton Wright (1836&#150;1909)")</script>, an Anglican clergyman and theological scholar, and his wife, Ebba Johanna Dorothea, daughter of Nils Wilhelm Almroth, governor of the royal mint, Stockholm. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37032/', "Sir Almroth Edward Wright")</script>, the bacteriologist, was an elder brother. He was educated at the Royal Academical Institution, Belfast, before following in his family tradition at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA (1885), and later proceeded LLB (1888) and LLD (1899). After his first-class degree in Greek and Latin he continued his education abroad, spending in 1888 almost a year in St Petersburg, where he lived in a professorial family and achieved fluency in Russian. Developing an antipathy to the all-apparent oppressiveness of imperial rule, he was discreetly sympathetic to nihilist aspirations. He travelled also in France, Germany, Romania, and his maternal Sweden, acquiring an unusually wide range of linguistic skills.<br>
<br>In 1890 Wright became an assistant librarian of the National Library of Ireland, and in 1893 he was appointed (from among 253 applicants) secretary and librarian of the London Library, where he continued in office for forty-seven years. The independent subscription library, founded in 1841, had outgrown its converted household premises in St James's Square. Complete rebuilding was urgently necessary, and the library's catalogues were inadequate for its growing stock. Wright had limited professional experience but boundless energy. The freehold buildings were reconstructed from 1896 at a cost of &pound;20,000, and opened in December 1898. Adjoining properties were acquired, providing space for extensions in 1922 and 1934. During his period of office the stock of books grew from 167,000 to 475,000 and the membership from 2293 to 4400.<br>
<br>Even more importantly, Wright set to work on recataloguing the entire library, working long hours, and by 1903 had produced the large first volume (revised in 1913&#150;14) of the author catalogue. Two supplements followed during his librarianship, with a third (covering the accessions of 1928&#150;50) eventually appearing in 1953. Accompanied by four volumes of subject indexes (1909&#150;55), this thorough, succinct, and consistent set of catalogues met the library's own needs and provided a valuable general reference tool which retains its value as a bibliographical guide. Wright, who also devised the library's unusual but serviceable classification, was from 1905 helped in his cataloguing work by his assistant (and later successor) C. J. Purnell, but the credit for its conception and execution is his alone. The subject catalogue office was adorned by a prominent notice: &#145;No guessing, no thinking. Accuracy, accuracy, accuracy!&#146;<br>
<br>Wright was a successful fund-raiser for building projects and for a staff superannuation fund. He was an energetic publicist for the library, which he described in a notable article as &#145;The soul's dispensary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, March 1922, and separately reprinted). Autocratic to, but respected by, his staff, he was&#151;with his black velvet jacket and heavy moustaches&#151;a familiar figure to members. His reputation grew even in his last years, when his involvement in library administration lessened. He received a knighthood in the new year's honours of 1934.<br>
<br>Wright's enthusiasm for Russian literature showed itself in the growth of the library's strong collection of foreign literature, and in his frequent essays in literary periodicals. A Tolstoyan who edited two volumes of the master's uncollected stories, he drew on his wide range of British literary contacts to organize (and present) a congratulatory address on Tolstoy's eightieth birthday in 1908. The 1917 revolution elicited Wright's guarded optimism but by the time of his final visit to Russia in 1928 any idealism it had shown had expired. During the First World War Wright had been much involved with the organization of Red Cross libraries for the sick and wounded, and in translation work and lecturing. On 20 February 1919 he married Constance Metcalfe (1864&#150;1949), daughter of Horace Lockwood, of Nunwood, Yorkshire, and widow of Tyrrell Lewis; there were no children.<br>
<br>Wright held on to the librarianship to be in office for the library's centenary in 1941, but died at 6 Westbourne Street, Lancaster Gate, on 7 March 1940, and was buried at Paddington new cemetery on 11 March following. His wife survived him. Two large albums of his occasional writings, collected by a female admirer, in 1912 and later, are held by the London Library.<br>
