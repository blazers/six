<span class="headword">Smyth,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1556), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was born around the turn of the sixteenth century to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73530/', "Matthew Smyth")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71874/', "Smyth family (per. c.1500&#150;1680)")</script>], a middling Bristol merchant and hooper, and his wife, Alice, the daughter of a local merchant. The common nature of his name makes it difficult to trace his early years with certainty. However, he was almost certainly apprenticed to a Bristol or Bridgwater merchant engaged in the Spanish trade. From 1525 the name John Smyth begins to appear regularly in the Bristol customs accounts in contexts associated with the continental trade. It seems likely that, when he married, it was to Joan White, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hoper (<i>d</i>. 1560), the widow of a wealthy Bridgwater merchant; she gave birth to their first son, Hugh, in 1530, and their second, Matthew, in 1533.<br>
<br>After 1530 Smyth became increasingly prominent in Bristol politics. His first major office was that of sheriff, which he held in 1532&#150;3. During this year he had to deal with a town inflamed and divided by the rival preaching of Hugh Latimer and William Hubbardine. As he testified against Latimer in an inquiry held that summer it would seem that he was opposed to religious change at that time. However, his later involvement in the sale of monastic lands indicates that he was prepared to be flexible on this issue.<br>
<br>Smyth's ledger for the years 1538&#150;50 provides detailed evidence of his commercial operations and is one of the best sources in this period for the business activities of an English merchant. The ledger reveals that he had extensive trade contacts with western France, the Biscay region of Spain, and south-west Spain and Portugal. He was involved in the export of cloth, lead, leather, and arable produce and the import of wine, iron, oil, and woad. Most of this trade was conducted in a fairly open and legal manner. However, it is clear that Smyth, along with other prominent members of Bristol's commercial community, was also involved in large-scale and well-organized illicit trade, principally the covert export of leather and arable produce to avoid the heavy licence charges to which these commodities were subject. The normal pattern of this, highly profitable, section of his trade was for a small part of a consignment to be legally declared in Bristol and for the rest to be transported from storage depots up the Bristol Channel to join outbound ships at the point where the Avon meets the Bristol Channel. The danger of capture was avoided by the local customs searchers being bribed before a ship's sailing.<br>
<br>Smyth was also involved in the shipping industry. From at least 1536&#150;46 he was the owner of a ship called the <i>Trinity of Bristol</i>. The returns on this vessel were generally good, and he was able to achieve a high price for his freight by allowing Bristol-based merchants to defer freight payments. By doing this he was effectively able to act as a financier to the city's smaller merchants without contravening the usury laws. For obvious reasons, Smyth particularly favoured the use of his own ship when he was conducting illicit exports.<br>
<br>From 1539 Smyth began to invest some of his profits in land and property, much of which become available in the wake of Henry VIII's religious reforms. In 1544 he acquired a grant of arms from the crown, and in 1545 he bought the estate of Ashton Court. This major property overlooked Bristol and was to be the home of his gentlemen descendants until the early twentieth century.<br>
<br>Smyth served two terms as mayor of Bristol, first in 1547&#150;8 and then again in 1554&#150;5. From the inventory of his goods it is apparent that he remained active in commerce until his death, at Small Street, Bristol, on 1 September 1556. He was buried in St Werburgh's Church.<br>
