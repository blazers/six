<span class="headword">Rainborow,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1587, <em>d.</em> 1642), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized at St Mary's, Whitechapel, on 11 June 1587, the eldest son of Thomas Rainborow (<i>d</i>. 1622) of Whitechapel, a prosperous mariner active in the Levant trade, and his wife, Martha More (<i>d</i>. 1631), and remained part of the close-knit Thameside community to the east of the City of London throughout his life. By 1618 he was sailing to the Mediterranean for the Levant Company, gaining its commendation for &#145;good service against pirates&#146;  (Hebb, 239): offered &pound;25 as a reward, he asked instead to be made a member of the company. From his father he inherited shares in a number of merchant ships, among them the 400 ton <i>Royal Exchange</i>, and in or before 1625 was made an elder brother of Trinity House. Shortly afterwards he became co-owner and master of the <i>Sampson</i>, a heavily armed merchantman of 500 tons, newly built at Limehouse, which he regularly commanded on voyages for the Levant Company to and from Constantinople, sometimes carrying English diplomats. Sailing alone from Constantinople in 1628, with Sir Thomas Roe and his wife aboard, the <i>Sampson</i> was attacked by galleys of the knights of the order of St John when becalmed off Malta. Over the next seven hours Rainborow's obduracy broke the spirit of the Maltese. Roe, adept at redeeming British hostages by diplomatic means, was, as he later wrote, only saved from becoming one himself by the &#145;brave courage and temper&#146;, as well as the seamanship, of his captain  (Strachan, 182). In the 1630s Rainborow was among the senior mariners consulted about manning the king's ships (1632), the Chatham chest (1635), and fraudulent timber imports (1638). He served as master of Trinity House in 1633&#150;4, ending his term just as Charles I's standing navy came into being. Edward Nicholas, then drawing up a list of suitable officers for Lord Treasurer Portland, included Rainborow as one of only two professional seamen &#145;that have the command as captain and [have] performed good fyght at sea in merchant ships&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/270/65).<br>
<br>His contribution to the ship money fleets reflected Rainborow's determination to make the most of an overdue opportunity to rally England's maritime resources in the interests of its seafaring community. In 1635 he was Lindsey's flag captain, and bolstered the royal fleet by supplying both the <i>Sampson</i> and the <i>Royal Exchange</i> on charter as part of the contingent from the City of London. Afterwards he proposed the removal of galleries from the king's ships as a fire risk, but found that the officers of the navy considered that to do so would &#145;much diminish &hellip; [their] beauty&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/311/65). Northumberland selected him as flag captain in 1636 and quickly established a productive working relationship. At the end of the year Rainborow played a full part in Northumberland's detailed inquiry into the fleet's most serious deficiencies, and vetted his report, even though to limited effect, before it reached the king. The definitive proposal for a blockade of the port of Sal&eacute; and its privateers in 1637 also came out of this association. Rainborow declared his &#145;extraordinary willingness to set forward that business&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/337/8) and Northumberland convinced Charles that he should take charge of it. Detailed advice was invited from Trinity House on the composition of his fleet, and four of its six captains were Trinity House brethren. Rainborow himself pressed for two pinnaces, to be built at once, for use in shallow waters inshore; and although his formal instructions still did not mention them, the admiralty accepted that without them &#145;the business cannot proceed&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/327/30). Writing to Wentworth at Dublin on 20 May, however, he made it clear that he would have preferred more than two, particularly as, to his growing irritation, the promised pair were proving to be so delayed that his four larger ships were left for more than two months to mount what blockade they could after Spain had failed to send any galleys. The turn of local politics within the port had as much to do with the successful outcome as had English seapower, a circumstance not lost on London commentators. After concluding a peace treaty with the king of Morocco in September 1637, and securing the release of 350 or so captives, Rainborow sailed home with the Moroccan ambassador and an English agent, Robert Blake. In what was a critical year for the future of ship money, from the submission of the king's case to the judges in February to the prosecution of Hampden in November, Charles was anxious to make the most of what might seem a happy demonstration of the practical benefits of the levy, hitherto less obvious to taxpayers than his concern for his sovereignty of the British seas. The ambassador was certainly extravagantly received, and fulsome accounts of his reception and of the expedition itself were soon in print; as Lord Conway observed, &#145;the reason of all &hellip; is the shipping money&#146;. But Rainborow, offered a knighthood by Charles, preferred to accept no more than a gold chain and medal worth, it was said, &pound;300  (<span class="italic">Earl of Strafforde's Letters and Dispatches</span>, 2.124, 129). At the same time onlookers in a crowded exchequer chamber daily disturbed the court by applauding the arguments of Hampden's defence counsel.<br>
<br>Rainborow had hopes in 1638 of undertaking a second stage in the campaign against the Mediterranean pirates; however, with Northumberland indisposed, his proposal in January for a more elaborate and expensive attack on Algiers found no favour, and instead he was given charge of the sea trials of the new great ship, the <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i>, which had been launched as he returned from Sal&eacute;. According to her builder, Phineas Pett, who was aboard, three days in August 1638 proved enough to assess the &#145;condition and working of the ship in all respects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 170). Thereafter it is unlikely that Rainborow went to sea again. He was among the founders of a poor seaman's fund, to be administered by Trinity House, in September 1638, and in 1639 proposed a scheme for arming colliers as support craft for &#145;a great army&#146;. During spring 1638 his daughter Martha and her husband, Thomas Coytmore, sailed for Massachusetts in a ship co-owned by Rainborow; and in time four of his six children lived for extended periods in New England, his sons William and Edward returning to fight for the parliamentarian side in the civil war. Rainborow was elected for Aldeburgh to both the parliaments of 1640, in April with Squire Bence and then in November with his tenant at Wapping, Alexander Bence, ending years of Howard influence. He was appointed to all the Commons' maritime committees, sometimes with Sir Thomas Roe, until 19 November 1641.<br>
<br>Rainborow died about 12 February 1642, and was buried on 17 February in St John's Chapel, Wapping. He had made his will in July 1638, and altered it little thereafter. He married twice. His first wife was a daughter of Rowland Coytmore of Wapping, an elder brother of Trinity House and a man of substance; the three elder children (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23020/', "Thomas Rainborowe")</script>, with a turbulent career ahead, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66326/', "William Rainborowe")</script>, and Martha, whose second husband was to be Governor John Winthrop) were all probably from this marriage. His second wife, whom he married about 1624, was Judith, daughter of Reynold Hoxton of Wapping; she died in March 1638 leaving three children (Judith, who later married Winthrop's son Stephen, Joan, and Edward). Rainborow's will was mainly concerned with his children, the five younger ones between them receiving the bulk of the &pound;5500 he disposed in monetary bequests. He left to Thomas houses in Southwark, &#145;some of them latelie built&#146; and bought from William Cambell, and to William houses in Gun Alley, Wapping. Other legacies were to the poor of Wapping (one by way of Trinity House) and Whitechapel; but he said nothing about his shares in ships.<br>
<br>Charles had recognized Rainborow's qualities as a professional seaman, but failed to give his inclination for reform the scope it needed, despite its moderate and conservative nature. Rainborow had little time for flights of fancy about sovereignty of the seas, and was much more concerned with finding ways of protecting merchant shipping and seamen, as ship money claimed to do, without damaging commercial interests. He recognized, better than the king, the urgent need to improve the versatility of the royal fleet as well as the quality of naval administration. In choosing to throw in their lot with the parliamentarian side in the months after his death, men who thought like Rainborow looked for a future beyond the misrepresentations and uncertainty of 1630s ship money. Prominent among them were three of the Trinity House captains who had served with him in the Sal&eacute; expedition.<br>
