<span class="headword">Perry,  Walter Laing Macdonald</span>, Baron Perry of Walton  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">pharmacologist and university administrator</span>, was born on 16 June 1921 at 5 Nelson Terrace, Dundee, the son of Fletcher Smith Perry (1888&#150;1960), an officer (later head) of the customs and excise in Scotland, and his wife, Flora Macdonald (<i>d</i>. 1966), daughter of Donald Macdonald. He was educated at Ayr Academy, Dundee high school, and the University of St Andrews, where he graduated MB ChB in 1943 (and MD in 1948 and DSc in 1958).<br>
<br>In 1944 Perry joined the colonial medical service as a medical officer, and was posted to Nigeria. There he was thrown in at the deep end. Within a week of his arrival in Kaduna (400 miles north of the Niger delta), to replace the resident on leave, he operated successfully on the wife of the dispenser for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. When the resident returned six months later Perry was transferred to Igbobi, near Lagos, to supervise the building and equipping of a rehabilitation hospital to provide for members of the Royal West African Frontier Force fighting in north Africa. He spent six months in Lagos ordering materials and equipment but never saw the hospital. His next posting was to Makurdi, the capital of Benue; there he was the only doctor in a region of about half a million people. The hospital had 120 beds with never fewer than 200 occupants, and Perry's day started with an outpatient clinic for about a hundred before breakfast. Much of his work consisted of treating parasitic diseases and the surgical treatment of serious accident victims.<br>
<br>On returning to the UK in 1946 Perry was called up to serve briefly in the RAF, with the rank of flying officer. On 16 November the same year, at the cathedral church of St Paul, Dundee, he married the 23-year-old Anne Elizabeth Grant, medical practitioner, and daughter of George Macdonald Grant, draper; they had three sons. In 1947 Perry was released from the RAF to join the department of tropical medicine in the Medical Research Council's National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) at Mill Hill to work in the physiology department, which had a worldwide reputation. In his first position he carried out an unusual array of different experiments that included an attempt to determine the extra-erythrocytic location of the malaria parasite and assays to look at the possible mode of action of paludrine, a novel antimalarial. This work, on monkeys and tissue culture, set him in good stead when later he was required to test batches of the Salk vaccine for the presence of live virus. In 1952 he became director of the department of biological standards at the NIMR. As director he was responsible to the Department of Health for implementing regulations for the production of all substances controlled under the <span class="roman">Therapeutic Substances Act</span>; and to the World Health Organization (WHO) as custodian of all the international standard preparations other than those for vaccines, antisera, and antitoxins held by the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen. Virtually automatically, at the age of thirty-one, he became a member of the British Pharmacopoeia Commission and of the expert committee on biological standardization of the WHO. He was made an OBE in 1957.<br>
<br>Perry now played a leading role in the government's attempts to provide adequate supplies of the Salk vaccine for poliomyelitis. But the constant political and public pressure limited his research activity and he began to look for a career change. Fortunately the Edinburgh medical school was looking to replace Professor John Gaddum, one of the world's leading pharmacologists, with a dynamic and innovative head of department, and Perry was appointed to the vacant chair of materia medica in 1958. His detailed knowledge of a wide range of research techniques and topics was crucial to rebuilding the department in Edinburgh and allowed him to promote the work of some and rejuvenate the work of others. While at Edinburgh he developed an interest in distance teaching, giving some students reading lists coupled with organized seminars; he found that these students did just as well as, if not better than, those taught traditionally in formal lectures. He also introduced computer marking of multiple-choice questions in examinations. He drew conclusions which were important later at the Open University, including that distance learning could not simply be left to reading, but had to include videos and other modern equipment to take the place of lectures.<br>
<br>After a successful term of office as vice-principal at Edinburgh (1967&#150;8) Perry was thinking in terms of a possible vice-chancellorship in a conventional university. But after seeing the advertisement for the new post of vice-chancellor of the Open University (OU) he began to think seriously about it. After consulting the Labour MPs Tam Dalyell and Jennie Lee he decided to apply and was appointed in June 1968. The magnitude of the task involved in setting up the OU could have been daunting for many people, but not to Perry. He led from the front in appointing academic and administrative staff, establishing the university structure and regional offices, initiating the operational side of course production, and liaising with the planning committee and the BBC. Not least he kept in touch with government, primarily through Jennie Lee, the minister of state at the Department of Education and Science, to whom Harold Wilson had given the responsibility for the OU. In all this work he was greatly helped by his new university secretary, Anastasios (Chris) Christodoulou.<br>
<br>There were several major policy decisions that Perry was instrumental in making in the early days of the OU. The first was that while there was to be open entry&#151;school examination qualifications not being required&#151;there would be no compromise on standards. The OU degree was to be comparable and equivalent to that offered by conventional universities. The second was to design a wide range of courses, including a brave decision to teach science at a distance. The third was to teach in a variety of media, through written textual material circulated to all students, through radio and television, through backup tutorials and summer schools (organized by the regional offices), and through home experimental kits. This rich mix of excellent instruction was a major reason for the success of OU teaching. But Perry also placed great emphasis on the importance of the course team. Into each team were drawn academic writers, educational technologists, and BBC production staff. Administrators, and publication and regional staff provided help and advice; and most crucially external advisers and assessors became involved at later stages. Thus an OU course became a joint responsibility, not belonging to any one professor or lecturer, although authorship of the individual units of a course was stated.<br>
<br>Perry was always a strong advocate of academic freedom but saw early on that academic freedom might be in danger of being compromised by the course team concept, for both staff and students. He realized that constant vigilance was needed at university level and this observation was borne out later by difficulties that the university encountered, with accusations of academic bias, both in the latter part of Perry's vice-chancellorship and later in the 1980s. The OU strongly and successfully defended its academic freedom on these occasions.<br>
<br>The early development of the OU required an enormous amount of work from many people who joined Perry's band of inventors and explorers, and they were devoted to him. But the drive, enthusiasm, and energy came from the top. Throughout 1969 and 1970 the new vice-chancellor worked eighteen hours a day and seven days a week, apart from a weekly round of golf at the Woburn course in the new city of Milton Keynes, to which Perry had engineered the transfer of the OU from its original location in Belgrave Square. The reward for him and his colleagues came in the remarkable response in applications when the OU opened its doors to students. 40,000 people applied in 1970 for the 25,000 places. It was a major logistical success for those new students to receive their course materials and start on their new degree courses in 1971. Under Perry's leadership the university continued to grow successfully throughout the 1970s, primarily in the undergraduate school. As its first chancellor, Lord Crowther, memorably described it at its inaugural ceremony in 1969, it was a university &#145;open as to people, open as to place, open as to methods, open as to ideas&#146;. By the time of Perry's retirement there were nearly 100,000 students enrolled on its courses. Perry also initiated activities overseas and set up a commercial arm for the sale of OU material. He undertook a limited number of personal outside activities&#151;for example, he joined the board of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. But his main focus remained within the university he had founded. He was a great first vice-chancellor of a very special university, and on retirement in 1980 he left a Rolls-Royce machine, purring along after the great alarums and excitement of the early days. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 21 August 1971, at St Luke's Church, Bedford, Perry married Catherine Hilda Crawley, a 25-year-old medical practitioner, and daughter of John Ambrose Crawley, barrister; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Perry was knighted in 1974 and created a life peer, as Baron Perry of Walton, in the 1979 new year's honours list. He took up his new duties with his usual enthusiasm and energy. He was a regular weekly attendee at the House of Lords and played a major role in its scientific committees, taking the chair for several inquiries. From 1981 to 1983 he was deputy leader of the Social Democratic Party in the House of Lords. His warmth and enthusiasm was unchanging, and he had strong views on current political and scientific developments. He also gained great pleasure from his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1985, for services to education and science. (He had been elected FRSE in 1960.) He was chairman of the standing committee on continuing education of the University Grants Committee, and of the National Advisory Body for Public Sector Higher Education, from 1985 to 1989. He received honorary degrees from Bradford, Dundee, and Stirling universities, as well as from the Open University and several universities abroad.<br>
<br>Perry was a man of great charm and charisma who enjoyed congenial company (he was a renowned musical performer and had a clear and assured voice). Nevertheless he was also tenacious, tactful, and tough, just the qualities that were required to establish the Open University. He lived in retirement in Edinburgh, but died at the Savile Club, Brook Street, Westminster, on 18 July 2003, following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Catherine, their three children, and the three sons of his first marriage.<br>
