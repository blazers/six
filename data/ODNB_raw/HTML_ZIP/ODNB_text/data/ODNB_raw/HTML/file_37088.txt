<span class="headword">Zimmern, Sir  Alfred Eckhard</span>  (1879&#150;1957), <span class="occ">internationalist</span>, was born in Surbiton, Surrey, on 26 January 1879, the only son of Adolf Zimmern, China and East India merchant, and his wife, Matilda Sophia Eckhard. His father's family were liberal-minded German Jews who had migrated to Britain in the wake of the 1848 revolution, while his mother was of Huguenot ancestry. Zimmern's family background gave him an easy and exceptional familiarity with continental Europe and its languages. Although he had an early interest in Zionism, he grew up a Christian. Educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, Zimmern was an outstanding classical scholar, and obtained first classes in honour moderations (1900) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1902). In 1902 he was awarded the Stanhope historical essay prize, and published a study of Henry Grattan. He remained at New College for a year as lecturer in ancient history, and from 1904 to 1909 as fellow and tutor. With a natural gift for teaching, Zimmern became involved, from 1907, in working-class education, and was an inspector of the Board of Education in 1912&#150;15. Wanting more time to write, Zimmern left New College in 1909. Financed by his father, he travelled to Greece, where he wrote <span class="italic">The Greek Commonwealth</span> (1911), a study of fifth-century Athens, which quickly won a worldwide reputation. In it Zimmern presented an idealized account of Greek values, and drew parallels between the ancient and modern worlds.<br>
<br>Zimmern was &#145;a man of considerable imagination and a keen sense of the tendencies of international politics&#146;  (Miller, 160). In 1905, after hearing the news of the first major victory of Japan over Russia, he went into his ancient history class at Oxford and said that he was going to lay aside Greek history for that morning to speak about &#145;the most historical event which has happened &hellip; in our lifetime, the victory of a non-white people over a white people&#146;. Twenty years later he identified the causes of war as being threefold: relations between the white and non-white peoples; the economic issue of the &#145;haves&#146; and the &#145;have-nots&#146;; and the problem of nationality, &#145;between the peoples who consider themselves culturally superior and those whom they despise&#146;  (ibid., 161).<br>
<br>Zimmern believed that it was both necessary and possible to outlaw war. During the First World War he wrote on the causes of war for the American liberal journal <span class="italic">The New Republic</span>. From 1917 he worked in the Ministry of Reconstruction, and in 1918&#150;19 in the political intelligence department of the Foreign Office. A founder, in 1920, of the Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), he was a leading figure in those circles advocating national self-determination, the establishment of a league of nations to prevent future wars, and the federation of the British Commonwealth. In July 1917, at the first annual meeting of the League of Nations Society, he proposed a treaty making &#145;war a crime in any circumstances&#146;  (Markwell, 280). Zimmern was the author of a Foreign Office memorandum which was the basis of the &#145;Cecil draft&#146; for the organization of the League of Nations which the British took to the Paris peace conference of 1919. Like Keynes, Zimmern severely criticized the reparations clauses of the treaty, but he approved of the political settlement.<br>
<br>In 1919&#150;21 Zimmern was Wilson professor of international relations at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth&#151;the first such appointment anywhere in the world. His time there was cut short by his marriage on 31 March 1921 to French-born Lucie Anna Elisabeth Olympe Barbier (1875&#150;1963), daughter of Pastor Maurice Hirsch Flotron and previously the wife of a fellow professor at Aberystwyth. She was a noted musician, and had helped popularize French music in England. Although Zimmern had learned Welsh and was a popular lecturer, &#145;the distinction of having acquired the language was more than outweighed by the opprobrium of having acquired the lady, and so he was prevailed upon to resign&#146;  (Markwell). In 1922&#150;3 Zimmern and his wife visited the USA, where he taught at Cornell University and completed <span class="italic">Europe in Convalescence</span> (1922), in which he castigated the policies of Lloyd George. In the general election of October 1924 he stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate for Caernarfon against Lloyd George himself.<br>
<br>Zimmern spent the rest of the decade working mainly in Paris and Geneva. In 1926&#150;30 he was deputy director of the League of Nations' Institute of Intellectual Co-operation (the forerunner of UNESCO) in Paris; from 1924, for many years, he and his wife conducted a summer school of international relations in Geneva. These schools were extremely popular, and allowed him the opportunity to observe closely the sessions of the league. The publication of <span class="italic">The Third British Empire</span> (1926) reflected his keen interest in the evolution of the British empire into the (British) Commonwealth, which he saw as a model for internationalism. By 1929 he had also published three collections of essays. His wife played a significant role in the development of his views.<br>
<br>Zimmern was a &#145;cautious&#146; idealist  (Rich, 79). While a believer in the chances of positive change in international affairs, and an advocate for the role of educated public opinion in bringing about those changes, he stood apart from those internationalists who placed their faith in world government. He regarded such views as na&iuml;ve and as taking too little account of the realities of nationalism. In 1933 he condemned the Oxford Union's &#145;King and Country&#146; motion, which he believed &#145;helped to intensify the reign of terrorism in Germany&#146;  (Markwell, 281).<br>
<br>In 1930 Zimmern was appointed the first Montague Burton professor of international relations at Oxford. In 1936 he published <span class="italic">The League of Nations and the Rule of Law</span>, and was knighted shortly afterwards. This book is Zimmern's most significant work, but is flawed through being time-bound, dominated by the events and spirit of its day. Its most striking aspect was Zimmern's belief in a continuing movement towards progress in international affairs. Although Zimmern was a pioneer in the development of international relations as an academic discipline, by the 1930s his writings &#145;began to bear more resemblance to idealist propaganda than serious academic concern&#146;  (Rich, 81).<br>
<br>Zimmern remained in his Oxford post until 1944. During the Second World War, when Chatham House moved to Oxford, he worked in its foreign research and press service, which did much work for the Foreign Office. When this service moved to London in 1943, Zimmern became its deputy director until 1945. He served as secretary-general of the constituent conference of UNESCO in 1945, was first executive secretary and later adviser to the preparatory commission for UNESCO, and remained a force on behalf of the organization during his final years in the USA.<br>
<br>Zimmern's replacement as secretary-general of UNESCO by Julian Huxley left him with a sense of grievance. In 1947 he left Europe for good, taking up the post of visiting professor at Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut. He was director of the Hartford study centre for world affairs from 1948. From 1950 he also taught at the American International College, Springfield, Massachusetts. Zimmern's idealism now embraced the role of the USA in the cold war, identifying it with the rule of law in the world. He died at Avon, Connecticut, on 24 November 1957 and was survived by his wife, a daughter, and a stepdaughter.<br>
<br>Of short stature and full-faced, Zimmern was warm and persuasive in personal contact, and remained vigorous until the end of his life. His thinking was neither especially deep nor distinctive, yet he attained extraordinary influence at the peak of his career in the 1920s, when journalists labelled him &#145;the ideal Prime Minister&#146;  (Markwell, 280).<br>
