<span class="headword">Yeoman,  Antonia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Beryl Botterill Thompson; <em>pseud. </em>Anton]</span>  (1907&#150;1970), <span class="occ">cartoonist and illustrator</span>, was born on 24 July 1907 in Esk, Queensland, Australia (she took the name Antonia when she became a Roman Catholic in her early twenties, influenced by the author R. T. Regent, a family friend). She was the eldest child of Arthur Henry Thompson (1855&#150;1911), an English sheep farmer and local agent for his father's trading company, shipping farming equipment from Liverpool to Australia. Her mother, Ida May Cooke (1882&#150;1955), was an Australian head teacher from Brisbane, Queensland. The family visited England on holiday in 1911, staying with relatives in West Kirby in the Wirral, Cheshire, where her brother, <a name="cosubject_66306"></a><span class="headword">Harold Underwood Thompson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Anton]</span>  (1911&#150;1996), <span class="occ">cartoonist and advertising and marketing executive</span>, was born on 9 April of the same year, and where their father died on 5 June of a brain haemorrhage following food poisoning. The family decided to stay in Britain and eventually settled in Brighton; in the 1930s her mother married Gordon William Griffin. Beryl went briefly to a local junior school where she caught tuberculosis of the spine which confined her to bed from the age of nine until fifteen and entailed the loss of two fingers of her right hand, and a number of trips to a sanatorium in Switzerland. Taught at first by private governesses, she learned to write and draw with her left hand and attended the Royal Academy Schools (1928) and studied art under Stephen Spurrier for a year before becoming a freelance commercial and fashion artist. She also produced advertising posters and showcards jointly with her brother from about 1935. Harold himself attended the same junior school as his sister and later went to Brighton College, ran an antique shop in Hove in his late teens, and studied life drawing at Heatherley's School of Fine Art (1931&#150;2). Here he met (and was subsequently briefly engaged to) Patricia Fell-Clark, a fellow student, later better known as the writer Patricia Angadi. He also studied lettering at St Martin's School of Art (1934), printing at Bolt Court, took private classes in illustration at Stephen Spurrier's school (1935), and spent two years drawing antique furniture in the Victoria and Albert Museum (1936&#150;8). Self-taught as a cartoonist, he began submitting drawings (and self-illustrated short stories) under the pseudonym H. Botterill (Botterill was their paternal grandmother's maiden name) to <span class="italic">The Bystander</span> (1935&#150;7), the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Night &amp; Day</span> (1937).<br>
<br>In 1937 Harold and Antonia formed a partnership producing cartoons as Anton (Harold suggested the name, as it sounded foreign and sophisticated), selling the first cartoons under this name to <span class="italic">Night &amp; Day</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">Punch</span> (26 January 1938)&#151;though the Antons in the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> (1939) were entirely Harold's work. &#145;As my line drawing was better than his and his observation and sense of form better than mine, we decided to form a partnership&#146;  (Antonia in <span class="italic">Illustrated</span>). Normally Antonia blocked out the drawing and her brother added the detail and what both of them called &#145;the squiggly bits&#146;, their trademark shading. However, interviewed in 1955 Antonia said: &#145;After all these years we have reached the point where each of us can produce an &#147;Anton&#148; and defy even the closest observer to say which of us drew it&#146;  (ibid.). At first they shared a flat in Earls Court, London, trading as Botterill Artists (Antonia still signing herself Beryl Botterill Thompson at this stage) and then briefly moved together to the south of France (1938&#150;9), still drawing for London publications. During the Second World War Harold trained at St Alfred's, Hove, Sussex, and served in the Royal Navy as a captain of minesweepers and convoy escort vessels in the Atlantic and along the British coast and was twice mentioned in dispatches. Antonia, meanwhile, worked in a canteen in Bognor Regis, Sussex, and continued to draw Anton cartoons. Here she met her husband, John Richard Harding Yeoman (1916&#150;1988), a former teacher serving in the army, and married him three weeks later, on 29 January 1941; they had no children. Shortly after this (17 October 1942) Harold married a Wren, Mary Kateley (1918&#150;1989), whom he had met in Plymouth; they had four children. After the war brother and sister teamed up again to produce numerous cartoons under their joint pseudonym for <span class="italic">Punch</span>, <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>, <span class="italic">London Opinion</span>, <span class="italic">Men Only</span>, and others. Harold, meanwhile, also worked in a creative capacity for Greenly's advertising agency and when this was taken over by the Lonsdale-Hands Organisation in 1954 he became creative marketing director and then senior marketing director of the company. This work left him less time for drawing&#151;though he continued to write short stories for the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> and others; designed posters, showcards, and advertisements (for among others Orient Shipping Line and Northern Aluminium); and wrote a book on marketing, <span class="italic">Product Strategy</span> (1962). In consequence Antonia took over the name herself, and by 1949 the Anton cartoons were entirely hers. They often included &#145;elegant men-about-town, superior spivs and the middle classes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 1 July 1970) and were drawn, usually in black and white, with Gillot 290 nibs and Indian ink with a distinctive &#145;squiggle&#146; technique to create half-tone effects. As well as in <span class="italic">Punch</span>, they appeared in <span class="italic">Tatler</span>, the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (&#145;Way of the world&#146; feature), and <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>. Two books of the jointly drawn cartoons were published: <span class="italic">Anton's Amusement Arcade</span> (1947) and <span class="italic">Low Life and High Life</span> (1952). Antonia also drew a series of popular Anton advertisements for Moss Bros. and others, including Simpson's Services Club, Morley Outfitters, and Saxone Shoes. In addition she illustrated seventeen books including works by Virginia Grahame and Denys Parsons. The only female member of <span class="italic">Punch</span>'s Toby Club, she was also&#151;in 1966&#151;the first woman to be elected to the Chelsea Arts Club (her husband&#151;a local councillor, a governor of both the Chelsea School of Art and the Royal College of Art, and secretary of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England&#151;was already a member). In addition she served on the council of the Artists' General Benevolent Institution for many years. Anton cartoons are held in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Cartoon Art Trust, and the University of Kent Cartoon Centre.<br>
<br>Antonia was about 5 feet 2 inches tall with short dark hair and brown eyes with wide owl-like spectacles. She walked stiffly as a result of tuberculosis of the spine and later arthritis. She died at St George's Hospital, London, on 30 June 1970. Harold Underwood Thompson was about 5 feet 8 inches tall, of stocky build, and usually clean shaven. In later life he moved to Wells, Somerset. He died in Taunton Hospital, Somerset, on 21 November 1996, was cremated in Bath the following week, and interred in St Thomas's Church, Wells, Somerset, with his wife who had predeceased him.<br>
