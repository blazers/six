<span class="headword">Cole,  Thomas</span>  (1628&#150;1697), <span class="occ">clergyman and Independent minister</span>, was baptized on 27 April 1628 at St Giles Cripplegate, London, the son of William Cole, gentleman. A pupil of Westminster School, he was a king's scholar in 1644 and was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, but remained at the school &#145;through the exigencies of war&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Westminsters</span>, 268), matriculating only on 1 February 1647, aged eighteen. He graduated BA from Christ Church on 6 November 1649, and MA on 8 July 1651, the latter degree being incorporated in Cambridge in 1653. On 15 October 1656 Cole was admitted principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford, where he acted as tutor to John Locke, but from which position he was removed in 1660. In 1659 he compounded for the first fruits of the rectory of Ewelme, Oxfordshire, but was ejected the following year. On 2 August 1660, however, he was ordained a deacon and priest, and became minister at Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire; in November 1660 Thomas Harley wrote that he had preached there, and &#145;the whole parish are well satisfied with him&#146;  (Cliffe, 99). Cole refused the tests laid down by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662, but &#145;appears to have deferred his resignation in order to allow his patron sufficient time to find a successor&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Cole may have retained a connection with his former benefice, for in April 1666 Philip Henry was &#145;at Aulam, where preaches one Mr Cole affectionately and to edification&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries and Letters</span>, 186). In that year he opened his academy at Nettlebed, Oxfordshire. The claim that Samuel Wesley, father of John Wesley, was a student there is incorrect; his later attack on Cole, and his generalizations about the poor moral tone of dissenting academies, drew chiefly on the remarks of James Bonnell, who attended as a student. Yet although Bonnell learned much &#145;Debauchery&#146; from his fellow students and claimed Cole &#145;was too Remiss in matters of Morality and Religion&#146;, he refused to &#145;accuse him of anything that was ill&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 125). In 1672 Cole tried but failed to secure a licence to preach at Henley town hall, but was licensed for other premises in the town: on 22 April as a congregational teacher at John Tyler's house and Alexander Bernard's barn, and on 16 May at his own house.<br>
<br>Unfavourable political circumstances probably contributed to Cole's decision to close the academy at Nettlebed in 1674, and to move to London. There he succeeded Philip Nye as minister of the Independent congregation which at that time met at Cutlers' Hall, Cloak Lane, and was later at Tallow Chandlers' Hall, Dowgate Hill. He was also one of the ministers of the merchants' lecture at Pinners' Hall. Despite his nonconformity Cole appears to have prospered, investing substantial sums in the East India Company and purchasing landed property in Oxfordshire which formed the basis of substantial legacies to his wife, Hannah (whose surname may have been Partridge), and to a daughter-in-law, nephews, and grandchildren.<br>
<br>In his last years Cole lived in Lime Street, London. He did not join the &#145;happy union&#146; between presbyterians and congregationalists, and was one of three London ministers who baulked at union with those who advocated sacramental communion with the Church of England. Though elected on 13 April 1691 as a manager of the ministers' Common Fund, he attended no meetings and refused to help in the enterprise. But in 1695, after the union fell apart, he became an original manager of the Congregational Fund board. Cole also took part in the renewed theological controversy which preoccupied his wing of dissent in the early nineties; his was an unbending high Calvinism: &#145;a secret conversing with a covenant of works &hellip; will worm out the covenant of grace, by turning it before you are aware, into a covenant of works&#146;. Cole regretted only that &#145;I have been no more vigorous and active in defending those truths&#146; against his neonomian opponents: &#145;God hath made me a man of contention; but I would have all the world know, that the doctrine I have been preaching, I can comfortably die in&#146;  (Wilson, 82&#150;3). Cole preached his last sermon before his congregation, which now met at Pinners' Hall, on 22 August 1697. He died in London on Thursday 16 September 1697, aged sixty-nine, and was buried in the upper ground of Bunhill Fields.<br>
