<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheridan,  Thomas</span>  (1719?&#150;1788), <span class="occ">actor and orthoepist</span>, was probably born in early 1719, though no records of birth or baptism have been found. His father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25369/', "Dr Thomas Sheridan (1687&#150;1738)")</script>, was by then running a highly regarded school at his house in Capel Street, Dublin, but there is a possibility that Thomas, his third son, was born in Quilca, co. Cavan, perhaps in the childhood home of his mother, Elizabeth MacFadden. Jonathan Swift, a close friend of Dr Sheridan, was Thomas's godfather and, by Sheridan's own account, a beneficent influence on him from childhood. Towards the end of his life he published a seventeen-volume edition of Swift's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1784), of which volume 1 was his own <span class="italic">Life of Doctor Swift</span>. His early education was at his father's school, where the performance of plays was encouraged. The chance to play Antony in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> in 1732 may have had a profound effect on Sheridan. Ambitious for his favourite son, Dr Sheridan enrolled him at Westminster School in 1733, but was financially unable to sustain him there, and it was with the aid of a scholarship that Sheridan entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1735. Dr Sheridan died suddenly on 10 October 1738, a year before his son graduated, leaving his large family in straitened circumstances. The need to make money combined with his love of the theatre to draw Sheridan to the Dublin stage, and he made his first appearance at Smock Alley on 29 January 1743 as Richard III, in which part, in the view of the <span class="italic">Dublin Gazette</span> (25 January&#150;1 February 1743) he &#145;vastly excelled whatever had at any Time been seen [in] the Kingdom before&#146;.<br>
<br>This was the beginning of the turbulent history of Sheridan's attempts to raise the standard of the Dublin theatre. It is a mixed history of honest endeavour, social and intellectual snobbery, wise economy, extravagance, and paranoia. Sheridan's ambition is clear from the parts he played in his first season. They included Brutus, Othello, and King Lear. His fiery self-regard is clear, too, in his preparedness to cross swords with a visiting celebrity, Theophilus Cibber. Their quarrel in July 1743 threatened to disrupt the season, and for once Cibber was more in the right than his adversary. Coincidentally the dispute brought about the meeting between Sheridan and his future wife, the novelist Frances Chamberlaine (1724&#150;1766) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25365/', "Sheridan, Frances")</script>], to whom he was married by 1747. Nurturing managerial ambitions, Sheridan travelled to London at the end of the 1743&#150;4 season. He made his d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> at Covent Garden on 31 March 1744 and joined the Drury Lane company for the 1744&#150;5 season, during which he established an edgy friendship with David Garrick.<br>
<br>Two decisions made in Dublin in 1744&#150;5 were to have a long-term effect on Sheridan's life. The first led to the uniting into a single company of Dublin's two theatres, Aungier Street and Smock Alley, the second to Sheridan's appointment as manager of the united company. His first period of management (1745&#150;54) began triumphantly, aided by his recruiting of Garrick and George Anne Bellamy. By July 1746 he was prosperous enough to buy Quilca House, Cavan, from his mother, presumably with an eye to his forthcoming marriage, which probably took place in 1747. Sheridan's second season as manager was marred by an incident that gave rise to the notorious Kelly riot. Kelly, a Galway &#145;gentleman&#146;, had made a drunken assault on one of the Smock Alley actresses at a performance of Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">Aesop</span> on 19 January 1747, and Sheridan had twice forcibly expelled him from the theatre. Kelly's supporters considered this a player's affront to a gentleman, and expressed their outrage two nights later by breaking up a performance, storming the stage, and physically damaging the backstage area. Kelly's trial was perceived in part, not least by Sheridan, as a test of the manager's right to the status of &#145;gentleman&#146;. There were sections of the Dublin public that never forgave him. Often high-handed, he lacked the diplomatic skills of a manager. Charles Macklin in 1748 and West Digges in 1754 publicly resented his treatment of them, and he offended Dublin society in March 1750 by refusing to release his musicians for a charity concert at the New Garden. But it was politics that precipitated the crisis of 2 March 1754. As one of the founders of the Beefsteak Club in 1752, Sheridan was readily associated with the &#145;English&#146; party in Dublin, and it was perhaps unfortunate that George II's proroguing of the Irish parliament coincided with a revival of James Miller's <span class="italic">Mahomet</span> at Smock Alley on 2 February 1754. A speech susceptible to patriotic Irish sentiment was vigorously encored. In what was to prove a critical moment in his life, Sheridan resolved on a second performance, and the result, on 2 March 1754, was the riot that wrecked the interior of the theatre and brought Sheridan to financial ruin from which he never fully recovered. In a sad footnote to the riot and ensuing debate, the Sheridans' infant son, christened Sackville in honour of the duke of Dorset (vice-regent of Ireland at the time), died of convulsions.<br>
<br>Sheridan sublet the theatre and took refuge in London, where he performed to lukewarm audiences at Covent Garden during the 1754&#150;5 season most of his favourite leading roles. He was not re-engaged. Instead, he spent the winter of 1755 preparing for publication a book entitled <span class="italic">British Education</span> (1756) and for delivery a series of twelve lectures on spoken English. Financial constraints drove him to return to the management of Smock Alley in May 1756, though with diminished enthusiasm. This second term was scarred by grudges and disputes, above all with John Lee and Spranger Barry. It was Barry's opening of a new theatre in Crow Street, Dublin, in October 1758 that drove Sheridan back to London. He had recently mortgaged Quilca House for the second time, and his Irish debts amounted to over &pound;7000. The Sheridans now had four children to care for. Thomas, their eldest son, had died aged three, but had been followed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25363/', "Charles Francis Sheridan (1750&#150;1806)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25367/', "Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751&#150;1816)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16335/', "Alicia, later Alicia Le Fanu (1753&#150;1817)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16339/', "Le Fanu, Philip")</script>], the aforementioned Sackville, and (Anne) Elizabeth Craford (<i>bap</i>. 1756). Sheridan was hoping for a new career in education, bolstered by Oxford University's incorporation of him as a master of arts in November 1758 (Cambridge would follow suit in 1769). Between 1759 and 1762 he published discourses on the theatre, on education, and on the English language, and began work on a dictionary towards which he was awarded an annual pension of &pound;200 and which was published in two volumes in 1780. Always liable to live beyond his means, he moved his family with three servants to Windsor in September 1759, planning to live by teaching, lecturing, and publishing, but need impelled him to return to Drury Lane for the 1760&#150;61 season.<br>
<br>A little grudgingly, Churchill's <span class="italic">Rosciad</span> (1761) placed Sheridan second to Garrick on the scale of genius, but this is to overrate his acting. Physically slight and vocally uneven, Sheridan was ill-suited to the heroic parts he favoured, though he was conscientious in delivering the meaning of his lines and disciplined in his preparation. He continued to act, in short bursts dictated by financial need, until 1777, mostly in London and Dublin, but also in Edinburgh, where he was awarded the freedom of the city on 6 July 1761. Plagued from youth by indigestion and in adulthood by creditors, he took his family to France in 1764, with the declared intention of curing the first and the undeclared intention of escaping the second, but the period of voluntary exile was brought to an end by his wife's death on 26 September 1766.<br>
<br>Sheridan had never had a settled home, and he had few enduring friendships. A brief period of residence in Bath in 1770&#150;71 enabled him, in conjunction with the musical Linley family, to launch a series of <span class="italic">Attic Evening's Entertainments</span>, with songs by Thomas Linley sung by his daughter Elizabeth, and recitations by Sheridan. The involvement of his brilliant son Richard Brinsley Sheridan with Elizabeth Linley, and their later marriage, caused a serious breach between father and son, in which Sheridan's tendency to a sense of moral and social superiority was characteristically alert. He was hurt by Richard's failure to invite his assistance in the management of Drury Lane in 1776, and when, in September 1778, &#145;he agreed to put the management into my hands upon condition that I should not appear as a performer&#146;  (letter to Charles Sheridan, dated 15 April 1783), the relationship remained tense. Sheridan worked with his son and Thomas Linley at Drury Lane until the end of the season in 1780, all the time waiting for the call to return to Dublin and save the Irish theatre. He was now being cared for by his younger daughter, Elizabeth, with whom he left Dublin <i>en route</i> for Portugal, in search of the Lisbon cure, in 1788. They got no further than Margate, where, on 14 August 1788, Sheridan died, with Elizabeth and a penitent Richard in attendance. He was buried, according to his own wish, where he died and &#145;in as private and cheap a manner as possible&#146;&#151;in fact, in the centre aisle of St Peter's Church on the Isle of Thanet, on 21 August. In 1823 Samuel Parr arranged for a memorial tablet in praise of Sheridan's intellect. Sheridan left the residue of his estate to his two daughters. All four of his surviving children became eminent in their way, among them the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25363/', "Charles Francis Sheridan")</script>.<br>
