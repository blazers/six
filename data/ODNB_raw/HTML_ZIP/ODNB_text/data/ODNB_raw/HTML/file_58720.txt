<span class="headword">Essinger,  Anna</span>  (1879&#150;1960), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 15 September 1879 in Ulm, Germany, the eldest of nine children of Leopold Essinger (1853&#150;1934), a Jewish insurance agent, and his wife, Fanny Oppenheimer (1858&#150;1942). She attended school in Ulm until 1893. In 1899 she went to live with an aunt in Nashville, Tennessee, where she became interested in education. At the University of Wisconsin she read German from 1913 onwards for an MA degree, then taught German there as a Pfister fellow. In 1919 she was sent to southern Germany by the American Society of Friends (by whom this non-practising Jew was greatly influenced) to organize the Quaker post-war relief work for children. Then she was involved in establishing further education programmes for working women, but decided, however, that her true vocation lay in educating children.<br>
<br>With the help of her family Essinger founded the co-educational progressive boarding-school, Landschulheim Herrlingen, near Ulm, in 1926. She was in close contact with leading national and international representatives of the New Education Fellowship. The education was based on some fundamental precepts: equal importance of practical and theoretical work; pupils taught in groups according to their abilities and individual work to be encouraged; no learning by rote; no physical punishment; no competitive tests or assessments. In her school English and French were even spoken at table. Teachers were addressed by their nicknames and the informal &#145;Du&#146;; the headmistress was Tante Anna.<br>
<br>When Hitler came to power in 1933, Essinger realized that her school would have no future in Nazi Germany. With the permission of the British authorities and the support of Quakers and private donors she secretly moved sixty-five Jewish pupils of her school to Bunce Court, a manor house near Otterden, Kent. Bunce Court School employed an equal number of English and German staff and also attracted British pupils. In view of possible emigration of pupils to Palestine modern Hebrew was offered. Practical work was no longer solely taught for pedagogical reasons, but also to make the school self-supporting. Sadly science was neglected in favour of the humanities. There were workshops in which photography, model building, art, and music were taught; an open-air theatre was built by the pupils where plays and operas were performed. Numerous Bunce Courtians, including Gerard Hoffnung, Frank Auerbach, and Frank Marcus, made careers in art, music, and literature, others in science. When the financial situation became precarious because parents were no longer able to send money abroad, the very short-sighted and stout but formidable headmistress made weekly fund-raising trips to London lecturing on the plight of refugee Jewish children.<br>
<br>In November 1938 Essinger was asked to organize Dovercourt Camp, a reception camp of the &#145;Kindertransports&#146; when 10,000 Jewish unaccompanied children arrived from Nazi Germany shortly after &#145;Kristallnacht&#146;. A guarantor had to be found for each child while dozens were admitted to her already overcrowded boarding-school. In June 1940 Bunce Court was requisitioned by the military. Trench Hall near Wem, Shropshire, was converted into a makeshift home for the school. Moreover, all male teachers and pupils over sixteen of German nationality were interned. After the war she returned to a dilapidated Bunce Court. The last intake included hidden children from eastern Europe and concentration camp survivors. In 1948 the school closed down, largely because it had fulfilled its purpose.<br>
<br>Essinger, a complex personality, had rescued many hundreds of Jewish children and given them a haven of security in her school family. In her last years she was blind and lived on the Bunce Court estate with three of her sisters who helped her to maintain an enormous correspondence with former pupils, many of whom visited her until her peaceful death at her home, The Bungalow, Bunce Court, on 30 May 1960. She was cremated at Charing, Kent, on 2 June.<br>
<br>Essinger's singular commitment perhaps left her with more admirers of her work than close friends. Professor Leslie Baruch Brent, a former pupil, concluded his funeral oration: &#145;Anna Essinger devoted herself singlemindedly to the cause of education and the saving of young lives from the persecution of Nazi Germany, and in this she was sustained by an unshakeable faith in the idea of human progress.&#146;<br>
