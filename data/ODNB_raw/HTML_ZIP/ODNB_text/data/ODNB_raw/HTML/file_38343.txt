<span class="headword">Bischoffsheim,  Henri Louis <span class="st"> [Henry Louis]</span></span>  (1829&#150;1908), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born in Amsterdam, the younger of the two sons of Louis Raphael Bischoffsheim (1800&#150;1873), banker, and his wife, Am&eacute;lie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goldschmidt. His grandfather, Raphael Nathan, had migrated to Mainz in the eighteenth century from Bischofsheim on the River Tauber in Baden, and thereafter he took the name of Bischoffsheim. He became president of the Jewish community in Mainz. His elder son Louis Raphael Bischoffsheim established a bank in Amsterdam with branches in Paris, London, and Antwerp. Paris later became his headquarters. Raphael Nathan's younger son, Raphael Jonathan, settled in Belgium, where he opened banking houses which rendered financial services to the Belgian government of such magnitude that after his death the street on which he lived in Brussels was renamed boulevard Bischoffsheim. He became a senator and was father-in-law of Baron Maurice de Hirsch.<br>
<br>Louis Raphael's elder son Raphael Louis settled in Paris, where he became a prominent and successful banker. He was also deeply interested in astronomy and founded one of the foremost observatories in France, close to Nice. Henri Louis, the younger son, went to London in 1849 to serve in the London branch of his father's business, which had been founded in 1836. The branch was under the management of his uncle, S. H. Goldschmidt, who subsequently retired to Paris and became in 1882 president of the Alliance Israelite. During his life in England Bischoffsheim was known as Henry. In 1856 he married Clarissa (1837&#150;1922), one of &#145;seven beautiful daughters&#146; of J. Biedermann of Vienna, four of whom married prominent figures in the City of London  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 March 1908). Her portrait was painted by Millais (1873). The Bischoffsheims had two daughters, one of whom, Ellen [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92362/', "Cuffe, Ellen Odette (1857&#150;1933)")</script>], became countess of Desart and the first female senator of the Irish Free State. Like her parents, she was very active in Jewish philanthropy. The second daughter married Sir Maurice Fitzgerald, knight of Kerry and equerry to the duke of Connaught.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1873 Henry separated from the Paris firm and settled into business, still in association with Goldschmidt, as a successful merchant banker. Until the mid-1870s when Bischoffsheim's business activities slackened, he carried on wide-ranging international financial operations from offices at 31 Throgmorton Street under the title of Bischoffsheim and Goldschmidt. The firm's success in the mid-nineteenth century, according to his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary, owed much to &#145;Mr Bischoffsheim's sanguine and energetic temperament&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 March 1908). Such an account, however, fails to bring out the controversial nature of the foreign loans with which Bischoffsheim and Goldschmidt became associated early in their partnership. The firm's involvement in the Honduras loan of 1867 was especially notorious. &#145;Bischoffsheims saw its chance for a killing and had few if any compunctions about taking it&#146;  (Kynaston, 270). This was one of the episodes investigated in March 1875 by the select committee on loans to foreign states, and it was undoubtedly the case that between 1866 and 1875, when the market in foreign loans reached its peak, &#145;their transactions were on an extraordinary scale&#146;  (Emden, 537). From <i>c</i>.1874 Bischoffsheim took little part in the affairs of the firm; although he still attended his office for a few hours on most days of the week and gave advice, he initiated no transactions. By this time Sir Ernest Cassel was a successful manager in the firm.<br>
<br>Bischoffsheim occupied his semi-retirement with a glittering social life and with philanthropy, in both of which his wife was his close partner. She was an active and distinguished hostess and was said to have won the favourable regard of Queen Victoria  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 March 1908). The couple gained the society nickname of the &#145;Bischs&#146;, and were known for the splendour of their entertainment at their London home, Bute House, South Audley Street, and their country estate, Manor House, at Stanmore, Middlesex. On these occasions &#145;Mrs Bischoffsheim played her part as hostess with a distinction and brilliancy which was natural to her; her husband was as unassuming as he was generous&#146;  (ibid.). Bischoffsheim also owned a stud farm, The Severals, at Newmarket.<br>
<br>The couple were generous donors to charity, especially to Jewish charity. &#145;That he accumulated a considerable fortune is a fact well-known, and even more notable is the generous use to which he put his wealth, of which he devoted large sums to general and communal purposes&#146;, noted the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> after his death. &#145;No movement of importance has gone forward in the community to which Mr Bischoffsheim did not contribute munificently and readily&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 13 March 1908). He was also actively involved on the committee of the Jews' Free School, the council of the Anglo-Jewish Association, the Roumanian Committee, and as a trustee of the Jewish Convalescent Home, Hampstead. He was one of the founders of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, and was the founder and sole owner of the Metropolitan Hospital Ambulances, which were established in various parts of London to provide first aid. The cost of constructing the children's wing of the Jewish Convalescent Home, which was established by his cousin Baroness de Hirsch, was also borne by Bischoffsheim. Together with his wife he founded the Daneswood Sanatorium at Woburn Sands, Bedfordshire, for Jewish consumptives.<br>
<br>The Bischoffsheims celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1906 by giving a total of &pound;100,000 to charity. The largest sum&#151;&pound;40,000&#151;was given to the Imperial Cancer Research Association, &pound;10,000 each to the Daneswood Sanatorium and to King Edward VII's Sanatorium; a further &pound;10,000 went to various Jewish charities. Although the public credit for these philanthropic activities often went to Bischoffsheim alone, the initiative often lay equally with his wife. She was active as vice-president of the Union of Jewish Women, served as a committee member of the Jews' Infant Schools and the Ladies West End Charity and of various hospitals, dispensaries and help societies. Bischoffsheim was also in his later years treasurer of the Twentieth Century League, founder of the Twentieth Century Club, and chairman of the committee formed to raise funds for the enlargement of the Stepney Jewish Free School.<br>
<br>Bischoffsheim died at Bute House, 75 South Audley Street, Mayfair, London on 11 March 1908 and was buried at the Golders Green cemetery of the West London Synagogue. Survived by his wife, he was described by the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> as<blockquote>an ideal type of the rich Jew. He gathered his vast wealth by means at which the sternest moralist could set no cavil, he took a pride and a pleasure in distributing huge amounts of it with an unsparing hand, an example to Jews of what a rich Jew should be, an example to the world of what a rich Jew can be.</blockquote>His obituarist added: &#145;Both in public and private life Mr Bischoffsheim was a man of exceedingly simple manners, and the natural amiability of his disposition was never spoilt by success&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 13 March 1908).<br>
