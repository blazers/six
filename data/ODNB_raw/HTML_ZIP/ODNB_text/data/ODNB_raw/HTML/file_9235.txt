<span class="headword">Feake,  Christopher</span>  (1611/12&#150;1682/3), <span class="occ">Fifth Monarchist leader</span>, was the eldest of five children of Edward Feake, gentleman, of Godstone, Surrey, and his wife, Anne Shaw. His birthplace is uncertain, although a Christopher Feake was baptized on 31 May 1612 at St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, in London. He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1628, aged sixteen, graduated BA in 1632, and proceeded MA in 1635. By 1637 he had married Jane Man, daughter of John Man of Paul's Wharf, London, a union which by 1653 had produced eight children.<br>
<br>Feake's clerical career began uneventfully as vicar of Elsham, Lincolnshire, about 1637. In January 1646 he obtained the sequestered vicarage of All Saints, Hertford, where his leanings to unorthodoxy soon became apparent. He dispensed with psalm-singing and the Lord's prayer, and preached against monarchy and aristocracy, asserting that there was in them &#145;an enmity against Christ&#146; which he intended to destroy  (Capp, 52). In 1647, upon the sequestration of the incumbent, William Jenkyn, Feake became vicar of Christ Church, Newgate, and shortly thereafter lecturer at both St Anne Blackfriars and All Hallows-the-Great, livings which by 1654 he had forfeited on account of being &#145;obnoxious to the government&#146;  (Wilson, 331). It was from these pulpits that his descent into notoriety may be said to have commenced in earnest.<br>
<br>Early in the 1650s Feake's oratorical skills and use of the pulpit to incite as well as to instruct were recognized as useful tools in attempts to destabilize the government. In 1650 he preached before the lord mayor of London in support of the fifth monarchy prophesied by Daniel, and in 1652, on the recommendation of Major-General Harrison, before the House of Commons. By the end of 1651 Feake, now an Independent, was one of a group in London beginning to organize the Fifth Monarchists, a movement which felt itself called to establish the latter-day fifth kingdom of Daniel's prophetic visions, using force if necessary. Feake's own interest in the prophecies of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and <span class="roman">Revelation</span> is said to have been provoked by the anti-prayer-book riots in Edinburgh in 1637. Feake soon became one of the movement's recognized leaders and one of the most hostile and outspoken critics of Cromwell and his government, which he had with some reservation initially supported. In December 1653 he openly denounced the protector as &#145;the man of sin&#146; and the &#145;dissembleingst perjured villaine in the world&#146;  (Thurloe, 1.621, 641). It was language that even the usually tolerant Cromwell found unacceptable, and Feake, together with Vavasour Powell, who had also preached in Fifth Monarchist vein at the same meeting, was arrested and imprisoned, though released shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>In January 1654 Feake was arrested again and imprisoned in Windsor Castle, now with John Simpson, another Fifth Monarchist, for &#145;the preservation of the peace of this nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653&#150;4</i>, 371). Feake, however, continued to lead the Fifth Monarchy movement from prison, notably through his pen, and his congregation in Warwick Lane and Swan Alley quickly published fourteen letters he had sent them urging the faithful, among other things, to be ready to raise an army &#145;for the King of saints&#146;  (Capp, 102). In 1654 Feake also published two of his most influential works, <span class="italic">The New Non-Conformist</span> and <span class="italic">The Oppressed Close Prisoner</span>, the latter title derived from an order of the council of state that Feake and Simpson were to be kept &#145;close prisoners&#146; (that is, without visitors and forbidden to speak publicly)  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1654</i>, 189). In <span class="italic">The Oppressed Close Prisoner</span> Feake had reluctantly conceded that Cromwell was the <i>de facto</i> but not the <i>de jure</i> ruler, an admission that was insufficient to obtain his release. His radical bent appeared again during his imprisonment at Windsor in his preaching from his cell window until he could scarcely speak for hoarseness, and teaching his young son to sing &#145;the Protector is a fool&#146;  (Capp, 108). In September 1655 Feake was removed to the Isle of Wight, where he remained in prison first with Harrison and later with Sir Henry Vane (the younger), until his release from Carisbrooke Castle on 31 December 1656.<br>
<br>Upon regaining his freedom Feake returned without permission to London, where he resumed his public opposition to Cromwell. In a meeting at All Hallows in January 1657 he denounced the government as being &#145;as Babylonish as ever&#146;, and disparaged what he considered the apostasy of many of the saints, declaring that he was &#145;for rending and dividing yet more&#146;  (Thurloe, 5.756, 758). After a sermon lasting three hours Feake was publicly opposed by Simpson, whose views were now less radical, and by the Baptists Henry Jessey and William Kiffin for this renewed attack on the government, which they considered immoderate and unnecessarily inflammatory. Feake and other more thoroughgoing Fifth Monarchists were generally more mutually supportive, his name appearing frequently during the 1650s under prefaces and introductions to radical works by Mary Cary (1651), John Tillinghast (1656), and John Canne (1657). He was not, however, among the militant group from Thomas Venner's congregation which by early 1657 was planning an uprising, although in February and April he condemned the arrest of its leaders and was briefly imprisoned in the Tower.<br>
<br>In June 1659, under the restored Rump, the fortunes of the Fifth Monarchists appeared to revive. Feake and Sir Henry Vane were thought by some, including John Ireton, the lord mayor of London, and Richard Baxter, to be the movement's leaders, although the designation of Vane was probably mistaken. But elation soon turned to disillusion. By the time the Rump was dismissed for the second time in October the Fifth Monarchists were fragmented beyond recovery, and the days of Feake's influence in London were in effect over. The publication of his <span class="italic">A Beam of Light</span> in 1659 was largely an account of what had been, although the remaining &#145;children of light&#146; were exhorted &#145;to be in readiness at an hour's warning&#146; to promote the cause of King Jesus and his still-awaited kingdom  (p. 59). Following the Restoration Feake, with others, attempted to keep the Fifth Monarchy cause alive, albeit with a less militant agenda. In 1661, as one of the movement's more able spokesmen, he travelled the country seeking to consolidate the flagging cause, occasionally showing up in London, but as in 1657, eschewing involvement with Venner's second uprising in the capital of that year, an event that helped ensure that by the mid- to late 1660s the Fifth Monarchy movement was already largely a spent force. In 1663 he was arrested in Dorking, Surrey, and taken back to London for questioning, but was released on a good-behaviour bond. He is recorded as a teacher at Dorking in 1662, and again in 1669 as preacher to a congregation of about 100 Independents, and was licensed as an Independent in 1672. He last appears as a preacher in a cellar on London Bridge in 1682.<br>
<br>Carlyle described him as &#145;loud-tongued, loud-minded Mr. Feak of Anabaptist-Leveller persuasion&#146;  (Carlyle, 320). That he was vocal and inflammatory there can be no doubt, but there is little evidence that he was either a Baptist or a Leveller. Capp plausibly suggests that Feake saw himself principally as a preacher of biblical truth, regardless of the consequences, compelled to enter the political arena by his obligations to the word of God. It is worth recalling that in the heat and turmoil of the 1650s Feake declared &#145;Tyranny itself is not so ugly a monster by many degrees &hellip; as is anarchy&#146;  (Feake, <span class="italic">Oppressed Close Prisoner</span>, 11). While attacking monarchy, government, taxation, and the legal system, and denying the validity of the national church and its clergy, he was not sufficiently opposed to the present order to decline sending a son to Oxford.<br>
<br>The date of Feake's death is unknown. His will has not survived, but in 1683 property he owned in Surrey passed to his son Samuel after disagreement with another son, John. Feake was survived by his wife, Jane, who by her will proved in 1693 left what possessions she had to her married daughter Mary Pigeon and an apparently small amount of money for the education of a grandson, Christopher.<br>
