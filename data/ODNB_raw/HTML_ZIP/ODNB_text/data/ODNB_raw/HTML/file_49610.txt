<span class="headword">Cohen,  Ruth Louisa</span>  (1906&#150;1991), <span class="occ">economist and college head</span>, was born on 10 November 1906 in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, the second child and elder daughter of the two daughters and three sons of Walter Samuel Cohen (1870&#150;1960), barrister and financier, and his wife, Lucy Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cobb (1877&#150;1942). The family background combined the <i>haute juiverie</i> of business with radical Unitarianism, free-thinking yet with a marked sense of public duty. After schooling with a governess and at Hayes Court in Kent, in 1926 Ruth Cohen followed her mother to Newnham College, Cambridge, to read for the economics tripos. Cambridge economics was at its most exciting and innovative and provided an atmosphere in which she thrived, being placed in the first class in part 2 in 1929 and winning an Adam Smith prize in 1930. In that year too she was awarded a Commonwealth fellowship and went off to spend two years in the United States, at Stanford and Cornell universities. On her return she became a research officer in the Agricultural Economics Research Institute in Oxford, where she remained until returning to Newnham as fellow and director of studies in economics in 1939. In 1930 she published <span class="italic">Factors Affecting the Price and Production of Potatoes</span>; in 1933 <span class="italic">Milk Marketing Schemes and Policies</span>; in 1934, with K. A. H. Murray, <span class="italic">The Planning of Britain's Food Imports</span>; in 1936 <span class="italic">The History of Milk Prices</span>; and in 1940 <span class="italic">The Economics of Agriculture</span>.<br>
<br>War service almost immediately took Cohen away from Cambridge again and she served first in the Ministry of Food (1939&#150;42) and then in the Board of Trade (1942&#150;5). She returned to teaching and research in Cambridge in 1945 when she was appointed university lecturer in economics. In 1954 she was enormously gratified to be elected principal of Newnham College. She led the college until 1972, a term of eighteen years which she afterwards characterized as too long both for an institution and for an individual. It was, however, a period in which Newnham followed her lead in wholehearted engagement with the affairs of the university (full membership of which had only been granted to women in 1948) and of the wider world, making its own modest contribution to the post-Robbins expansion of higher education with a new building.<br>
<br>In these decades Cohen served on the economics faculty board, on the university syndicates on education and on the relationship between the university and the colleges, as a university member of the county education committee, on the academic planning board for the new University of Essex, as a governor of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, as a lay member of the General Medical Council, and as chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture committee for the provincial agriculture advisory service. She was appointed CBE in 1969.<br>
<br>Cohen approached administrative matters with the same immense energy, ruthless economy, grasp of detail, and directness, sometimes to the point of bluntness, with which she approached everything, including her beloved and beautiful garden. It made for brisk meetings and clear, if parsimonious, outcomes. She did not suffer fools gladly; but she took a broad and generous interest in all her students and her colleagues, often knowing and understanding far more about them than they realized. Her clarity of vision and unswerving sense of principle supported many of them in difficult and delicate situations.<br>
<br>External commitments, and the detailed grip on college affairs and finances which Cohen maintained, precluded much new research in these years, though in 1953 she had surveyed farm price controls in western Europe and in 1958 she published <span class="italic">Effects of Mergers</span> with P. L. Cook. However, she continued to keep abreast of new work, to teach, and to advise in her specialist field of agricultural economics. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32478/', "Sir Andrew Cohen's")</script> term as governor of Uganda (1952&#150;7) fostered a considerable interest in and knowledge of east African affairs.<br>
<br>On retirement from the principalship in 1972 Cohen characteristically took herself off to France for six months, to give her successor a clear run and to learn to cook. Then with gusto she embarked on a new career as a Cambridge city councillor, holding Newnham ward for the Labour Party from 1973 to 1987. She tackled council business and fought for her constituents with the same attention to detail, economy, and pugnacity with which she had led her college, visiting the site of every planning application and proving a very tough and effective chairman of the finance committee when Labour took control of the council in 1980.<br>
<br>Peripheral neuropathy increasingly limited her mobility in her last years. With clear-eyed practicality she sold her house, found a ground-floor flat, and learned to use a Batricar. Instead of leading the canvassing on foot she organized it from her sitting room for everyone else. Cohen died suddenly, but peacefully, at her home, 2 Croft Lodge, Barton Road, Cambridge, on 27 July 1991, watching the test match on television, just as the progress of her illness was beginning to threaten her cherished independence. She never married. Her body was cremated at Cambridge crematorium.<br>
