<span class="headword">Shuckburgh, Sir  Richard</span>  (1596&#150;1656), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and antiquary</span>, was the second son of John Shuckburgh (<i>d</i>. 1631), gentleman, of Shuckburgh, Warwickshire, and his wife, Margery (<i>d</i>. 1629), eldest daughter of Richard Middlemore of Edgbaston, Warwickshire. He was educated at Lincoln College, Oxford, and graduated BA on 3 May 1615. On the death of his childless elder brother, John, in 1625 he became heir to the family estates. On 30 November 1627 he married Mary Crompton, the widowed daughter of Ralph Sneyd of Keele, Staffordshire. Mary died childless on 5 September 1629 and on 10 December 1630 Shuckburgh married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Lee of Billesley, Warwickshire. Shuckburgh's father died in 1631 and his second wife two years later, leaving him an eligible, childless widower. On 4 February 1634 he married Grace (<i>d</i>. 1677), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13619/', "Thomas Holte")</script> of Aston, one of the foremost landowners in Warwickshire. In 1635 a son, John, was born.<br>
<br>In 1635 Shuckburgh was appointed to the Warwickshire bench and in 1640 he secured the second Warwickshire seat in the Long Parliament. Despite his kinship with the Middlemores, a prominent Catholic family, he was a convinced Calvinist and co-operated fully with the Long Parliament's anti-papist actions. On the outbreak of civil war he attempted to maintain a neutral stance. He was imprisoned by the House of Commons in September 1642, but bailed the following month and returned to Warwickshire. By tradition he was hunting on his estates when he encountered Charles I on the march to Edgecot and was personally enlisted by the king. In October 1642 he was present at Edgehill, where he was knighted. According to the family tradition he returned to Shuckburgh after the battle and defended the house unsuccessfully but with great bravery against a parliamentarian force. He was sequestered and imprisoned for a time, but benefited from the influence of powerful friends. When his case was discussed by the county committee, the earl of Denbigh was reported to have &#145;excused his going to the king and said it might be to do good offices&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1649&#150;50</i>, 444&#150;5). He was acquitted by the sequestration committee at Westminster in March 1647 and survived a further attempt to convict him of royalism in November 1651.<br>
<br>In his retirement Shuckburgh interested himself in history and antiquities, assisting with the research for William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Warwickshire</span>. Thomas Fuller dedicated to him the third section of the fifth book of the seventeenth century of his <span class="italic">Church History</span>. Shuckburgh died in London on 13 June 1656 and was buried at the church of St John the Baptist, Upper Shuckburgh. He and Grace had four surviving sons and two daughters. His heir, John, married Catherine, daughter of Sir Hatton Fermor of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, in December 1656, and was created a baronet in 1660 in recognition of the service of his father and maternal grandfather to Charles I. Shuckburgh's wife survived him and subsequently married John Keating, chief justice of the common pleas in Ireland. She died in Dublin in April 1677.<br>
