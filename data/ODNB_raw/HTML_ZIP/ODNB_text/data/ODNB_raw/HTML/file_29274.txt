<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Blacklo]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1592/3&#150;1676), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and philosopher</span>, was born into a landowning recusant family as the second son of Richard White (<i>d</i>. 1634) of Hutton, Essex, and Mary, daughter of the eminent Elizabethan lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22389/', "Edmund Plowden")</script>. His sister Mary married Phillip Waldegrave of Borley, and his elder brother Richard became a proficient mathematician and a fellow of the Royal Society. One younger brother, Jerome, became a Catholic priest; the other, William, left few traces other than a will in which he distanced himself from Thomas's political views. A lifelong Catholic who never saw any reason to renounce &#145;the religion of our birth and education&#146;  (T. White, <span class="italic">Apology for Rushworth's &#145;Dialogues&#146;</span>, 1654, 117), White became a secular priest, notorious as leader of the Blackloist faction or cabal of the English chapter, as well as &#145;a most noted philosopher of his time&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1247). Author of some forty works on theology, politics, and natural philosophy, he achieved the rare distinction of incurring suspicion and disapproval both from his own church, which consigned all his writings to the Index, and from the English parliament, which suspected him (together with Hobbes) of tending &#145;to Atheism, Blasphemy, or Profaneness&#146;  (Southgate, 32). An engraving by Vertue indicates that White was a serious man with a commanding and possibly pugnacious presence, and an eighteenth-century biographical sketch describes him as being of unblemished morals and &#145;of a middle size; agreeable in conversation, unbyassed in the controversies of life; and affecting a freedom of opinion, which seldom happens without danger&#146;  (Dodd, 3.285). This last comment understates the extent to which White was constantly embroiled in controversies: his personal and published writings reveal a man whose greatest pleasure lay in vigorous debates with friends and enemies.<br>
<br>White's Catholic education and career necessitated extensive European travels and also involved contacts with a succession of continental English colleges. His recusant credentials having been established with a brief incarceration for his faith aged ten, he reached the Jesuit college at St Omer in the Spanish Netherlands by autumn 1605; after graduating in humanities he proceeded in autumn 1609 to Valladolid, Spain, aged sixteen, and then in 1612 to Seville. In August 1614 he went on via Madrid to Flanders, and he completed his theology course at Louvain before arriving at the mother English College at Douai in July 1616. White was ordained as priest at Arras in 1617 and took his degree one year later at Douai. He continued to teach philosophy and theology at Douai until 1623, the year in which he retrieved from England a rib of the recently martyred Thomas Maxfield to serve as a sacred relic at the college. His long-standing, though intermittent, association with Douai was later marked by his appointment as vice-president of the college there in 1650. Meanwhile, in 1625 White was sent as official Catholic agent to Rome, where for four years he maintained lines of communication between the beleaguered English clergy and the pope. In 1630 he reluctantly became the second president of the English College at Lisbon, Portugal, where he established a traditional scholastic curriculum, but, having failed to recruit appropriate theology students from England, he resigned in 1633. That year his name was submitted to Rome as a possible bishop, and ten years later he was proposed as vicar-general. By the early 1640s, however, he was established in Paris as a respected member of the Mersenne circle, and in that cosmopolitan environment he published two major works of natural philosophy: <span class="italic">De mundo</span> (1642) and <span class="italic">Institutiones peripateticae</span> (1646; translated as <span class="italic">Peripateticall Institutions</span>, 1657) which shows reciprocal influences with his friend Kenelm Digby's <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span> (1644). These essentially synthesizing works incorporated ideas from the current new philosophy within a traditional Aristotelian framework, and with his remarkable accommodation of Copernican heliocentric cosmology and newly revived atomic theory, White was later identified by Leibniz as one who had contrived to &#145;reconcile Aristotle with modern philosophy&#146;  (Southgate, 9). Favourable assessments of <span class="italic">De mundo</span> were made by contemporaries including Descartes, and a lengthy critique by Thomas Hobbes, rediscovered and published in 1976, did much to restore interest in White himself.<br>
<br>During the later 1640s and early 1650s there is evidence for White's presence in London, Lyons, Rome, Douai, various parts of Holland, and Paris, where he was described by John Evelyn as &#145;a learned priest and famous philosopher&#146;  (Southgate, 7). In London again by 1655, he became established as leader of the Blackloist group of Catholic chaptermen, including Kenelm Digby, Henry Holden, Peter Fitton, and John Sergeant. Notorious for their willingness to sacrifice Jesuits and any papal temporal powers in return for religious toleration, these &#145;Papists of the new Modell&#146;  (M. Poole, <span class="italic">Nullity of the Romish Faith</span>, 1666, 39), denied papal infallibility and repudiated conventional and lucrative beliefs about purgatory. Unsurprisingly, White's doctrines, as expressed in such theological works as <span class="italic">De medio animarum statu</span> (1653; translated as <span class="italic">The Middle State of Souls</span>), were held in Rome &#145;in so great a detestation &hellip; that neither that of Luther or Calvin was ever in a greater&#146;  (Westm. DA, Old Brotherhood archives, 2.67). Nevertheless, the Blackloists continued to dominate the English chapter for many years: White's disciple John Sergeant was installed as secretary from 1655 until he was ousted in 1667 by Rome's replacement, John Leyburn.<br>
<br>Approached for political advice after Cromwell's assumption of power, White published <span class="italic">The Grounds of Obedience and Government</span> (1655). Supposedly a theoretical treatise, this had obvious practical implications at the time: with its provocatively emblazoned republican motto of &#145;salus populi&#146; and its evident recommendation to accept Cromwell's <i>de facto</i> position, the book was widely regarded as anti-monarchical, and after the Restoration White was repudiated by protestants and Catholics alike. Under attack from all quarters, he was induced to defend himself in an extensive &#145;Apology&#146;, which survives in manuscript  (Westm. DA, Old Brotherhood archives, 2.130), but nothing could save him from contemporary distancing or from subsequent historical neglect.<br>
<br>White's extraordinary intellectual energy in later life is indicated also by his attention to other aspects of philosophy and theology. During the 1650s he enjoyed contacts with men who were to become founding fellows of the Royal Society. Centred on the puritan reformer John Hall, this group included John Wallis, Seth Ward, John Wilkins, Lord Brouncker, Ralph Bathurst, Isaac Barrow, and Pierre Fermat. White acted as a linkman to whom they professed themselves deeply indebted. Stimulated by such company, he published further scientific and mathematical works, including <span class="italic">Euclides physicus</span> (1657), claimed as an influence on Leibniz, and <span class="italic">Exercitatio geometrica</span> (1658), in which he fails in attempts to square the circle. Theological works include <span class="italic">Apology for Rushworth's &#145;Dialogues&#146;</span>, in which he clarifies his detestation of sceptical uncertainty and affirms oral tradition as the ground of Catholic faith; and <span class="italic">Religion and Reason</span> (1660) and <span class="italic">Devotion and Reason</span> (1661), where he reiterates his lifelong belief in the compatibility of Christianity with the rationality of science.<br>
<br>White's work in London was interrupted by the imminent restoration of the monarchy. With his life at risk as a result of his political notoriety, he withdrew to Holland in 1659, explaining later that he had heard &#145;that his majesty's settled resolution was to hang mee if I came into England&#146;  (Westm. DA, Old Brotherhood archives, 2.130). Far from lying low, however, he released further theological broadsides. <span class="italic">Monumetham excantatus</span> and <span class="italic">Statera morum</span> (1660), which contained arguments that even the greatest sinners might be redeemed, provoked a moral outcry even from friends. His long-standing enemy George Leyburn described him at this time as a &#145;wicked old man &hellip; known sufficiently and more than that to the Pope and the whole Roman court&#146;  (Burton and Williams, 2.547), a view confirmed by official condemnations in 1655, 1657, 1661, and 1663. Indeed, it was agreed by friends and enemies that White might well have encountered even more opposition had not his convoluted style prevented ready comprehension. By 1662 White was back in London, where he published in 1663 a critique of Torricelli's work on the vacuum, and entered a significant debate on scepticism with Joseph Glanvill. The younger man's promotion (in his <span class="italic">Vanity of Dogmatizing</span>, 1661) of the fashionable Pyrrhonian philosophy provoked White's <span class="italic">Sciri, sive, Scepticis</span> (1663; translated as <span class="italic">An Exclusion of Scepticks</span> (1665), where he insisted on the possibility of humans attaining absolutely certain truth; their continuing debate highlighted essential incompatibilities between their respectively &#145;modern&#146; and &#145;ancient&#146; positions. Until his own death in Drury Lane on 6 July 1676 White persisted, too, in heated philosophical debates with Thomas Hobbes. White was buried on 8 July in the old St Martin-in-the-Fields, and his will confirms earlier claims that he never had social aspirations or saved money: he left &pound;10, together with any &#145;wearing apparel and other goods in their house at my death&#146;, to John and Mary Gregson, with whom he had been lodging in Drury Lane, &#145;for the care they have had of me while I lived with them&#146;  (Berks. RO, Barrett/Belson MS Q26/2). The residue consisted of arrears from an annuity bequeathed by Kenelm Digby: that was to be held in trust for John Sergeant, who would keep Blackloism alive until his own death in 1707.<br>
