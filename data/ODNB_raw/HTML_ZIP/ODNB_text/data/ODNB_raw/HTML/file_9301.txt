<span class="headword">Fenwick,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1603&#150;1657), <span class="occ">colonist in America, army officer, and politician</span>, was the son of George Fenwick of Brinkburn, Northumberland, a country squire, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of John Forster of Newham. He matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1619, was called to the bar at Gray's Inn, London, on 21 November 1631, and was admitted ancient on 24 May 1650. He married, at some time between 1634 and 1639, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1645/1648), daughter of Sir Edward Apsley of Thakenham, Sussex, and widow of Sir John Boteler of Teston, Kent (<i>d</i>. 1634).<br>
<br>Fenwick was a proprietor of land in southern New England acquired through the 1632 patent of Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick. In 1636 he arrived in New England as the vanguard of an expected wave of puritan grandees preparing to settle along the Connecticut River. This grand migration never fully materialized and Fenwick's initial stay was short. Nevertheless, he helped establish a defensive fort called Saybrook, in honour of Lord Saye and Sele and Lord Brook, two patent holders, at the mouth of the Connecticut River before departing for England that same year. He returned with his wife and household to establish a plantation at Saybrook in 1639. There he served as agent for the patentees and <i>de facto</i> governor until 1644.<br>
<br>Although he did not accept their invitation in 1639 to become a freeman and magistrate, Fenwick worked co-operatively with the leaders of neighbouring Connecticut colony. On 29 July 1641 he joined with agents of Connecticut and New Haven to acquire the earl of Stirling's land claims to Long Island. In 1643 Connecticut paid &pound;40 for repairs to the Saybrook Fort, which protected both the Saybrook plantation and Connecticut's upriver towns. That same year Fenwick served as a commissioner from Connecticut for the United Colonies of New England, an intra-colonial defensive alliance. He was reappointed commissioner in 1644 and 1645, and named a magistrate of Connecticut colony in 1644 and 1645 and <i>in absentia</i> in 1647 and 1648.<br>
<br>On 5 December 1644 Fenwick, as agent for the Warwick patentees, sold the Saybrook Fort and lands along the Connecticut River to Connecticut colony for &pound;1800, of which Fenwick received &pound;1600 through levies on goods passing the mouth of the Connecticut River. Fenwick had also promised to convey to Connecticut lands mentioned in the Warwick patent between the Connecticut River and Narragansett Bay, if it came into his power to do so. His inability to make good on the transfer of these patent lands, which may have been due to the questionable validity of the Warwick patent itself, led in later years to numerous disputes. In 1657 Connecticut refused to give Fenwick's heirs possession of his estate until they paid &pound;500 for non-fulfilment of the agreement.<br>
<br>Fenwick returned to England in 1645. His wife, Alice, who died at Saybrook shortly afterwards, following the birth of their second child, Dorothy, was interred within the fort. In England Fenwick served under Warwick as a member of the parliamentary commission for the English plantations in America. On 20 October 1645 he was elected to the Long Parliament as a member for Morpeth. During the second civil war he commanded a regiment of northern militia, took part in the defeat of Sir Richard Tempest, relieved Holy Island and recaptured Fenham Castle. On the surrender of Berwick he became governor of that place, apparently as deputy for Sir Arthur Haslerig, with whom he served on the commission for plantations, and whose eldest daughter, Catherine (1635&#150;1670), became Fenwick's second wife. Fenwick was appointed one of the commissioners for the trial of the king, but did not act. In 1650 he took part in Cromwell's invasion of Scotland, was made governor of Leith and Edinburgh Castle in December 1650, and took Hume Castle in February 1651. He was also one of the eight commissioners appointed for the government of Scotland in December 1651. In the two parliaments of 1654 and 1656 he represented Berwick, and was one of the members excluded from the second of those parliaments. According to his monument in the parish church of Berwick, Fenwick died on 15 March 1657, and this is confirmed by the fact that a new writ for Berwick was moved on 26 March 1657. In some accounts Fenwick is confused with Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Fenwick, who was killed in the battle of Dunkirk on 4 June 1658.<br>
