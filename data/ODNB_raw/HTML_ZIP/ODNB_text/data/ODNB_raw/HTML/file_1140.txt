<span class="headword">Baker,  Thomas Barwick Lloyd</span>  (1807&#150;1886), <span class="occ">promoter of reformatory schools</span>, was born at the family seat, Hardwicke Court, the only son of Thomas John Lloyd Baker and his wife, Mary, daughter of William Sharp of Fulham. Like his father, Baker went to Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1826 but did not graduate. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1828 and in 1833 became a magistrate for Gloucestershire, where Hardwicke Court was located. Shortly afterwards he became a visiting magistrate at the county gaol and house of correction at Gloucester. In 1841, on the death of his father, a noted innovator in local poor-law administration, Baker inherited Hardwicke Court. A high-church Anglican, Baker contributed substantially to the restoration of Hardwicke, Uley, and other churches, and urged the different skeins of Anglicanism to rejoice in diversity and tolerance of one another. He was a staunch tory all his life, and was president of the Gloucestershire chamber of commerce, a captain in the county yeomanry cavalry, a deputy lieutenant of Gloucestershire, and high sheriff of Gloucester in 1847&#150;8. Baker was well known locally as an ornithologist and, indeed, his first published work in 1835 was an index of birds. On 10 March 1840 he married Mary, daughter of Nicholas Lewis Fenwick of Besford Court, Worcestershire; they had two sons, Granville Edwin Lloyd Baker (<i>b</i>. 1841), high sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1898, and Henry Orde Lloyd Baker (<i>b</i>. 1842).<br>
<br>Baker became internationally known for two things: his pioneering work in reformatory schools and his writings on crime and punishment. He first encountered reformatories for young offenders in London in 1837 and was also in close touch with the well-known pioneer of these institutions, the Revd Sydney Turner. Following a large conference on the subject at Birmingham in 1851 attended by Turner and the other doyen of the movement, Mary Carpenter, Baker knocked two farm cottages in the grounds of Hardwicke Court into one and opened Hardwicke Reformatory. A close associate and co-manager at the beginning of the project was George Henry Bengough (1829&#150;1865), a local landowner and theorist about crime and punishment who, for the first two years, spent long periods living and teaching at the reformatory. With a permanent staff of four and an average of forty young males up to 1870, the institution was certified under the 1854 <span class="roman">Reformatory Schools Act</span>, which regulated and encouraged the spread of these institutions; after 1870 the number of inmates rose to an average of seventy.<br>
<br>Baker was leader of one of two schools of thought about reformatories. On one side, Mary Carpenter and her supporters propounded a model for reformatories in which staff were viewed as substitute parents and agents of holistic personal transformation of the individual offender, and in which individualized treatment and long periods of education and patient, careful nurturing characterized by disciplined but warm engagement between staff and inmates would serve to rescue the young offenders from the delinquency formerly fostered by their corrupting social environment. Baker took the reverse view: reformatories were to be reserved only for recidivistic youth and should deter further delinquency by severity. At Hardwicke, therefore, the inmates were compelled to carry out heavy spade work on the clay soil of the farm and were punished by beating or confinement in cells for any disobedience. Baker was sure that hard labour in the countryside away from the corruption of cities would condition minds and bodies to habitual labour, induce mental tranquillity, and (incidentally) roughen and callous hands deliberately kept tender and nimble for pickpocketing or till raiding. There were night classes in reading, writing, and arithmetic, but classroom education took second place to labour, and the inmates slept in hammocks in dormitories. Baker kept the young offenders for much shorter periods than reformatories run on the nurturing/interactive model, only two years on average, and always released them on licence, often to work for local farmers. The regime depended on a marks system, whereby compliance earned amelioration of severity; it was this model, of deterrent, rigidly routinized, total institutions, which prevailed in the reformatories that spread across Britain following these pioneering projects, rather than that of Mary Carpenter. Baker was convinced that his severe model hugely reduced crime by general deterrence and the habituation of the inmates themselves to labour and obedience.<br>
<br>Baker wrote about 200 journal and newspaper articles (in both the local and the national press) on crime and punishment. In all his writings he advanced the view that an effective system of criminal justice administration rested on the double foundations of the criminal's cognition of punishment and of motivation for good behaviour. He believed that to deter crime there must be very widespread knowledge of the punishment for criminal behaviour, and that this punishment should operate not on the basis of maximum retributive severity to all offenders, nor yet on what he viewed as unsuccessful individualized reformatory programmes, but on the basis of an accumulation of punishment in accordance with the known convictions and proven antecedent behaviour of the offender. A first conviction for the majority of offenders would carry a very short prison sentence to achieve the maximum shock; each subsequent conviction would carry a higher penalty until the fourth, which would automatically carry a sentence of life imprisonment to secure the maximum incapacitation from crime of the individual offender and the maximum of deterrence to others.<br>
<br>Allied to this &#145;cumulative system&#146; of deterrence, Baker demanded a prison system which enlisted the offender's motivation and energy in his own reformation. The initial regime would be extremely severe but, as the prisoner demonstrated compliance and commitment to the programmes of the institution, would progressively allow greater freedom and comfort until eventually the prisoner would secure conditional release on licence supervised by the police. In 1871 a version of this system was introduced by Baker in Gloucestershire following work on similar lines pioneered by Sir Walter Crofton in Ireland.<br>
<br>Baker also designed a system, known as &#145;The Berkshire system&#146;, to test the veracity of those claiming relief at workhouses on the basis that they were travelling to a place of employment. This was experimentally tried in Gloucestershire from 1868 onwards. Baker was regularly cited by internationally known theorists of crime and punishment of his time, such as the fourth earl of Carnarvon, William Tallack, E. C. Wines, and Professor Von Holtzendorff. He was also a founder of the highly influential National Association for the Promotion of Social Science. A selection of his writings was published by Herbert Philips and Edmund Verney in 1889 as <span class="italic">War with Crime</span>.<br>
<br>Baker suffered ill health from 1882 onwards and thereafter took a lesser part in local public affairs, although he continued to publish up to 1885. He died at Hardwicke Court on 10 December 1886, and was buried at Hardwicke church.<br>
