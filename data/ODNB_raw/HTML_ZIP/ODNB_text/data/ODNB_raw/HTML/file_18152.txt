<span class="headword">Marshall,  Walter</span>  (1628&#150;1679), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born on 15 June 1628 at Bishopwearmouth, co. Durham, the son of Walter Marshall, the curate there from 1619 to 1629. In 1639 at the age of eleven he was elected a scholar of Winchester College. At New College, Oxford, he graduated BA on 28 April 1652; he was a fellow from 1648 to 1657. On 10 May 1654 he was admitted to the rectory of Fawley, Hampshire, and in the same year acted as an assistant to the commissioners into the ministry in the county. On 28 November 1656 he was admitted to the living of Hursley, 4 miles from Winchester, but did not get on well with the patron, Richard Major, Richard Cromwell's father-in-law. On 15 December 1657 he was also elected a fellow of Winchester.<br>
<br>Marshall resigned from Winchester in 1661. In August 1662 he was ejected from Hursley following the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, but soon after he settled as minister of an Independent congregation at Gosport. He was presented at the assizes in autumn 1662, for taking a service without reading from the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Marshall was still living at Hursley in November 1667, but appears in the episcopal returns of 1669 as preaching at Winchester and Alton. In 1672 he was living under the protection of Richard Norton, patron of the donative cure of Southwick in Hampshire, and obtained a preaching licence there as a congregationalist on 10 August. It is reported that Marshall was continually troubled by an unquiet conscience and even consulted Richard Baxter about it. When he made his will on 24 July 1679, Marshall was living in the parish of Alverstoke. He named his wife, Rebecca, as executor, gave to his son, Walter, most of his books and the reversion of a living granted him by Winchester College, and left &pound;80 to Anne, one of two daughters. By 1 August he was dead. His funeral sermon was preached by Samuel Tomlyns of Andover. It was published with a preface dated 23 August 1680 and dedicated to Lady Anne Constantine, Mrs Mary Fiennes, and the inhabitants of Gosport. Marshall's <span class="italic">The Gospel Mystery of Sanctification</span> was published posthumously in 1692. James Hervey stated in a preface to the sixth and many subsequent editions that, if banished to a desolate island with only a bible and two other books, he would choose this work as one of them.<br>
