<span class="headword">Farington,  Joseph</span>  (1747&#150;1821), <span class="occ">landscape painter and diarist</span>, was born at Leigh vicarage, Lancashire, on 21 November 1747, the second of the seven sons of William Farington (1704&#150;1767), rector of Warrington and vicar of Leigh, and his wife, Esther Gilbody (1716&#150;1794) of Manchester. His elder brother William (1746&#150;1803) and two of his younger brothers, Henry (1750&#150;1827) and Richard Atherton (1755&#150;1822) were all employed in the naval service of the East India Company. A fourth brother, George (1752&#150;1788), was also a painter<a href="#cosubject_9160"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>, a fifth brother, Edward (1758&#150;1790), had his naval career cut short by yellow fever, and the sixth, Robert (1760&#150;1841), studied theology at Brasenose College, Oxford, becoming vicar of St George-in-the-East, London. Educated in Manchester, Farington was sent to London in 1763 to train in the studio of Richard Wilson. In 1764, in 1765, and again in 1766 he won premiums for landscape drawing from the Society of Artists of which he became a member in 1765. He joined the Royal Academy Schools at their inception in 1769 and was elected ARA in 1783, and RA in 1785.<br>
<br>Farington contributed yearly to the exhibitions until 1801, then only intermittently until 1813. Without ever holding a major post within the academy, he played a very active role in its affairs, attending general and council meetings and many of the special committees which refined its policies, among them the influential hanging committee which regulated the placing of works in the yearly summer exhibitions. From 1793 he was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and from 1805, although unable to join because of his profession, he took a keen interest in the development of the British Institution, particularly contributing both expertise and loans to the exhibition on Thomas Gainsborough, William Hogarth, and Richard Wilson in 1806, and included an account of the Reynolds retrospective of 1813 in his <span class="italic">Memoirs of the life of Sir Joshua Reynolds, with some observations on his talents and character</span> (1819).<br>
<br>Never having studied abroad in his youth, Farington was sent by William Windham, MP for Norwich, to the Netherlands in 1793 to prepare illustrations for an official record of the siege of Valenciennes. An unpublished notebook of that year (Royal Library, Windsor) records Farington's reaction to the large altarpieces by Rubens which he saw in Antwerp. A second foreign trip, to Paris during the short peace of Amiens in the summer of 1802, was made in the company of Benjamin West, John Hoppner, and Johann Fuseli among others, and introduced him to some of the finest antique sculpture and Italian art looted from Italy by Napoleon, then filling the Louvre (at that time known as the Mus&eacute;e Napol&eacute;on). He also took the opportunity of visiting the studios of leading French painters such as Jacques-Louis David (1748&#150;1825) and Fran&ccedil;ois G&eacute;rard (1770&#150;1837), with whose polished style he was not in sympathy. Already in his fifties he seems to have been overwhelmed by the richness of the art on view and from then on painted ever more rarely, rather concentrating on the topographical work in which he excelled. It is difficult to make a real appraisal of his paintings as they are scattered in many private and public collections, and rarely appear in art sales. Examples exist in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Farington's real forte lay in the careful, accurate topographical drawings which he prepared for the folios of engravings of British views which found a ready market among tourists confined to Britain by unrest abroad. From 1776 to 1780 he had lived in the north country, painting, drawing, and eventually publishing <span class="italic">Views of the Lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland</span> in 1785. In 1794 he published two volumes of a <span class="italic">History of the River Thames</span> with seventy-six aquatints, and text by William Combe. In later years he became closely involved with two even more ambitious projects: <span class="italic">Britannia depicta</span> (Cadell and Davies, 1808&#150;14) and <span class="italic">Magna Britannia</span> (William Byrne, from 1813). The publication costs proved to be so high that neither work was completed. The preparation for these publications necessitated a vast amount of travelling, and Farington undertook yearly tours in late summer and autumn.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1776 Farington had married Susan Mary Hamond (1750&#150;1800), the daughter and sister of East Anglian clerics and closely related to the Walpole family; their marriage remained childless. After her death in 1800 Farington suffered a breakdown, being left unable to draw or paint. It was with the help of his family and such close friends as Sir George and Lady Beaumont, Sir Thomas Lawrence, and the whole of Robert Smirke's family that he regained his equanimity. He took a close interest in his brothers' numerous children, encouraging their education, advising on their careers, and sympathetic to their sentimental problems. His <span class="italic">Diary</span>, which he kept from 13 July 1793 until the day of his death (with very few interruptions), contains many accounts of family visits to the north and to Norfolk, and in later years to the south coast and the Isle of Wight. He died on such a visit to his brother Richard in Lancashire, on 30 December 1821, as the result of a fall downstairs from the gallery of Didsbury church, and the last entry in his <span class="italic">Diary</span> is a moving tribute from his niece Marianne.<br>
<br>A tall, urbane man, Farington mixed easily in all branches of the professions and society. Through his own career he had an unrivalled knowledge of the London art world, the daily occurrences of which he recorded in his <span class="italic">Diary</span>. With its emphasis on biography and anecdote it is an invaluable source of information on artists of the period and of the internal workings of the Royal Academy. However, the diary also records the social, political, and literary events of the day, though as Garlick and Macintyre note, on these subjects Farington is rarely an original source  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.xxxii). Through his own family, Farington had connections with the newly wealthy industrialists of the midlands, and with the East India Company; and through his wife's Norfolk connections and through the election as MP of his cousin, Admiral Gardner, first to Plymouth (1795&#150;6) then to Westminster (1796&#150;1806), he was kept informed on both domestic and foreign policy. Farington attended the major political trials, such as Warren Hastings's impeachment, followed Wilberforce's anti-slavery campaign, and, through his close friend Sir Thomas Lawrence, he was apprised of many details of the &#145;delicate investigation&#146; into the conduct of the princess of Wales.<br>
<br>Written for Farington's own amusement and as an <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i>, the sixteen volumes that constitute his diary passed through the artist's family until they were sold at auction in 1921 to the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. Published first in serial form, they were edited by the paper's art critic John Greig and published in a series of volumes between 1922 and 1928. Presented to George V in 1934, the diary is now in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. A sixteen-volume printed edition of the <span class="italic">Diary</span> was issued between 1978 and 1984 and an index, edited by the author of this entry, was published in 1998.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_9160"></a><span class="headword">George Farington</span>  (1752&#150;1788), <span class="occ">history painter</span>, a younger brother of the above, was born in Warrington in 1752. In 1773 he was employed with his brother in making a record of the paintings in the Walpole collection at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, before their shipment to Russia. After a short period with Benjamin West, he became a student at the Royal Academy, winning a silver medal in 1779 and a gold medal in 1780 for history painting with <span class="italic">The Cauldron Scene in &#145;Macbeth&#146;</span>. In 1782 he sailed for India, undoubtedly encouraged by his brothers who served in the East India Company. He was in Calcutta by 1783, where a notice in the <span class="italic">Calcutta Gazette</span> advertised that pictures by Francis Swain Ward could be seen at Mr Farington's at the Old Library. In 1784 he gave 300 rupees to the building of St John's Church. It was in Calcutta that Farington met Sir John D'Oyly, former resident of the nawab's court at Murishdabad. Competition among painters probably encouraged Farington to leave Calcutta for Murishdabad in 1785. There he received a warm welcome from the resident, Robert Port, who commissioned several paintings, including a small version of <span class="italic">The Durbar at Murishdabad</span>, which Farington was painting for D'Oyly. A version was later returned to England, and to the possession of Richard Farington in Lancashire. Another patron was General Claud Martin, who owned four portraits by Farington, and there is evidence to suggest that he painted scenes of local ceremonies  (Archer, 126&#150;9). He died at Murishdabad in May 1788 as the result of a chill. A studio sale of his work was held in Calcutta after his death, the proceeds of which went towards helping settle William Farington's East India Company debts.<br>
