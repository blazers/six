<span class="headword">Watts, Sir  John Peter Barry Condliffe <span class="st"> [Johnny]</span></span>  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born John Peter Barry Condliffe on 27 August 1930 at The Orchard, St George's Road, Portsmouth, the son of Leonora Emily Condliffe, drapers' shop assistant, of 4 Balfour Road, North End, Portsmouth. His mother subsequently married Gerald Walter Watts, civil engineer, and he took the surname Watts. In 1936 his mother and stepfather went to India. Watts attended school in Cornwall until he joined them in 1939 at the start of the Second World War. He attended schools in Quetta and other stations in north-west India, and acquired a lasting interest in and affection for the subcontinent. From Sheikh Bagh School, Srinagar, Kashmir, he went to Westminster School (1944&#150;7), then, on an English Speaking Union scholarship, attended Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, for a year. He went to Venezuela and reportedly worked as a bodyguard. Called up for national service in 1949, he attended officer cadet school at Eaton Hall, Cheshire. Selected for training for a regular commission, he attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. In February 1951 he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR). After two years in Hong Kong (during which he was promoted lieutenant, in 1953) he volunteered for a tour with the Parachute regiment and joined the 3rd battalion in Suez early in 1954. Back in England, on 11 December 1954 he married Mary Elizabeth Gertrude Flynn, a 26-year-old state registered nurse, and daughter of Thomas Flynn, postal clerk. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1955 Watts's company was attached to 22 Special Air Service (SAS) for a two-year operational tour in Malaya during the emergency. David Stirling's original Second World War SAS had been disbanded in 1945, and 22 SAS was founded in Malaya in 1952: in the 1950s it was little known outside the army, and within the army had a low reputation as a &#145;shoddy&#146; unit and career suicide for an officer. In Malaya, Watts first experienced the &#145;low intensity&#146; counter-insurgency that became his speciality. After a posting to 1 RUR in Cyprus on emergency operations he was recalled to Malaya to command D squadron, 22 SAS. He took part in several major operations deep in the jungle, and was promoted captain.<br>
<br>In 1957 the sultan of Oman, Said bin Taimur, requested British assistance against the Saudi-supported Imamist rebellion. The rebels held the Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) in northern Oman, a high massif with precipitous cliffs. RAF air power failed to dislodge them and the British government did not want to risk using a well-known regiment. In October 1958 D squadron, 22 SAS, commanded by Watts (by now a major), was rapidly recalled from the Perak jungle and sent to Oman. Watts blockaded the routes up the Jebel and by December had established a foothold on the slopes. Following the arrival of a second SAS squadron, on the night of 26 January 1959, though not fully recovered from malaria, he led a moonlit, daring, hazardous ascent of the Jebel cliff, forcing the rebels to flee. The short, successful campaign helped save 22 SAS from disbandment, and Watts was awarded an MC.<br>
<br>In 1959 Watts was posted to 1 RUR in the British army of the Rhine. He then attended courses at the Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham, Berkshire, and the Staff College, Quetta, Pakistan, and served as GSO2 at headquarters Berlin. In 1964 he returned to 22 SAS, then in Borneo and involved in the confrontation with Indonesia. The SAS was overstretched and needed another squadron there, so Watts raised and trained B squadron which, within a few months, was operational under his command. The SAS served in the jungle on arduous border surveillance, &#145;hearts and minds&#146; activities, training the indigenous border scouts, attacking Indonesian incursions, and, from 1964, on the secret &#145;Claret&#146; raids into Indonesian territory. In 1965 Watts took his squadron to Aden, where they fought rebel tribesmen in the Radfan. He returned to 1 RUR as a company commander for eighteen months before attending the United States overseas defence course in Virginia. In 1967 he went to Hong Kong as brigade major, 48 Gurkha infantry brigade, and in 1968 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Irish Rangers (into which the RUR had been amalgamated).<br>
<br>In December 1969 Watts took command of 22 SAS. With defence cuts and possible disbanding of 22 SAS he wanted a new role for it and saw the potential of involvement in Oman, oil-exporting from 1967 but threatened by rebellion in the southern province of Dhofar, a harsh mountain area. The rebels were Marxist guerrillas supported by South Yemen, the USSR, and China, and armed with Soviet and Chinese weapons. By spring 1970 Oman was losing the war. This threatened British and Western interests, because of Oman's oil and strategic importance at the entrance to the gulf: 70 per cent of Europe's oil requirement and 30 per cent of the United States' passed through the Strait of Hormuz. In March 1970 Watts, as Mr Smith, flew to Oman, but Sultan Said rejected his proposals. In July Said was deposed by his son Qaboos in a palace coup supported, and allegedly plotted, by the British. Qaboos was Sandhurst-trained, a modernizer determined to win the war and develop Oman. Watts was sent to Oman to report on how to assist Qaboos's government. Using his counter-insurgency experience, he recommended a coherent plan for victory, with SAS participation including intelligence gathering, &#145;hearts and minds&#146; assistance, civil development, raising Dhofari soldiers to fight for the sultan, and persuading rebels to change sides. With the American experience in Vietnam in mind, he was concerned at the political implications of British combat losses. Briefing Colonel Tony Jeapes before the latter left for Oman, he insisted, &#145;Whatever you do, you must not have casualties. Got it? Because if you do, that will be it&#151;finished. We will be withdrawn&#146;  (Jeapes, 61). Following Watts's plan, SAS soldiers in the innocuously named British Army Training Team raised and led <i>firqats</i> (irregular units of local warriors) and, as in Malaya, used &#145;surrendered enemy personnel&#146;. In October 1971 Watts commanded operation Jaguar, a successful offensive by G squadron SAS and Omani units, during which he personally rescued a wounded soldier under fire. On completion of his tour he was appointed OBE, in 1972. The war was not yet won, and he left feeling his task was unfinished. However, he contributed to the &#145;textbook counterinsurgency campaign&#146;  (Mockaitis, 93), resulting in victory by 1976.<br>
<br>From 1972 to 1974 Watts was a stimulating instructor at the Staff College, Camberley. In 1974 he was briefly a staff colonel at the Ministry of Defence. From 1975 to 1978 he was director, as a brigadier, of the SAS group. The SAS was then operating in Northern Ireland in a different and controversial role, in plain clothes and clandestine. When two carloads of SAS soldiers had mistakenly entered the Irish Republic and been arrested, he accompanied them at their trial at Dublin. In 1979 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>The British-seconded post of commander of the sultan of Oman's land forces was due to become vacant in 1979. Qaboos rejected the officer proposed by the British government and instead requested Watts. From 1979 to 1984 Watts commanded the sultan's land forces, modernizing and accelerating the replacement of British officers and NCOs by Omanis. Promoted lieutenant-general, he was chief of defence staff in Oman from 1984 to 1987. Appointed CB in 1985, he was knighted in the new year's honours list of 1988. He retired to Wiltshire, but repeatedly revisited Oman and was visited by Omani friends. His first marriage had been dissolved in 1986 and on 13 February that year he married Diana Merran Watts, formerly Walker. A 45-year-old divorcee, and daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Reginald Steward, army officer, she had already changed her name to Watts by deed poll by the time of their marriage.<br>
<br>Short, stocky, and swarthy, with &#145;an engagingly crumpled face&#146;  (de la Billi&egrave;re, 128), a &#145;great wide grin&#146;  (Fiennes, <span class="italic">The Feather Men</span>, 306), dark eyes, black hair, deep-voiced, and often scruffy and careless of his appearance, Watts was a heavy smoker. Brave, tough, determined, enthusiastic, and resourceful, he was described by Sir Peter de la Billi&egrave;re (who served as his second-in-command) as &#145;an exceptional leader &hellip; a real soldier's soldier &hellip; much loved by the soldiers, and a marvellous man to work for&#146;  (de la Billi&egrave;re, 128&#150;9, 259). He had an easy, self-deprecating charm, was well-read, loved poetry, and was interested in political and military history, especially of the north-west frontier. He died on 10 December 2003 at his home, Swaynes, Salisbury Road, Steeple Langford, Salisbury, Wiltshire, of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, and was survived by his wife, Diana, and the seven children of his first marriage.<br>
