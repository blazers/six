<span class="headword">Archer,  Georgina</span>  (1827&#150;1882), <span class="occ">promoter of women's education</span>, was born on 27 September 1827 in Edinburgh, the youngest of the four children of Andrew Archer, dentist, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cunningham. The family consisted of two sons and two daughters. The eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30434/', "James Archer (1822&#150;1904)")</script>, was a portrait painter, and the younger son, Andrew, was the author of a history of Canada (1876).<br>
<br>Georgina Archer was orphaned at the age of fourteen. Thereafter, she went to live with two unmarried aunts in Edinburgh, where she attended a private school. After completing her education, she became tutor to the children of an invalid lady. She then returned to live with her aunts for a time in order to engage in further study. She was, however, frustrated in her ambition to obtain a university education, and departed for Germany in 1850, settling initially in L&uuml;neburg. From 1857, until her death, she resided in Berlin. In the same year she published a book of fairy tales, entitled <span class="italic">Flowers and Moonshine</span>, under the pseudonym of Dudu.<br>
<br>Georgina Archer was a teacher of English, and was employed by Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, the Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia, as tutor to her children, Wilhelm (the future Wilhelm II), Heinrich, and Charlotte. Wilhelm II later recalled that Georgina Archer had been &#145;a lively, pleasant person&#146; and that her educational abilities had been &#145;remarkable&#146;. Georgina Archer was also a friend of the crown princess and continued to visit both her and her children after she had ceased to be their tutor. Georgina Archer shared the crown princess's commitment to the cause of women's education, and in 1869 she founded the Victoria Lyceum, with the encouragement of the crown princess. The Lyceum served as a college of higher education for women. Initially, there were only four weekly lectures, attended by seventy students. However, by 1890, thirty-nine weekly lectures were given, with one thousand students attending. Georgina Archer was director of the Lyceum until her death and gave highly popular lectures on English literature, which were noted for their interest, originality, and humour.<br>
<br>In addition to her ground-breaking work in the sphere of women's education, she also established three societies: The Association for Home Hygiene, which was concerned with the welfare of the poor; the Sanit&auml;ts-Verein (&#145;health association&#146;), which entitled teachers and governesses to high-quality medical treatment; and The Anglo-German Club, which sought to promote cordial relations between the two peoples and to counter mutual prejudice.<br>
<br>Georgina Archer had a large number of friends and was universally regarded as sociable and likeable. Her nature was characterized by a selfless devotion to the welfare of others. As a teacher she was remembered for her enthusiastic and diligent approach. She had a determined character, as witnessed by her commitment to the cause of higher education for women at a time when there was considerable official hostility to this aim in Germany and elsewhere. Georgina Archer's health broke down in the final months of her life, as a consequence of overwork. She died on 18 November 1882 at Montreux, Switzerland, and was buried there.<br>
