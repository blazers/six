<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanhope,  William</span>, first earl of Harrington  (1683?&#150;1756), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was the third surviving son of John Stanhope of Elvaston, Derbyshire, and his wife, Dorothy, the daughter of Charles Agard of Foston, Derbyshire. His elder brother was <a href="#cosubject_26240">Charles Stanhope (1673&#150;1760) [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Having begun his career in the army, Stanhope entered the diplomatic service, in which he found early success and royal approval, and later enjoyed a long period as secretary of state. Horace Walpole said that Stanhope &#145;raised himself from a younger brother's fortune to the first posts in Government, without either the talent of speaking in Parliament, or any interest there&#146;  (Hervey, 1.4). He was educated at Eton College and at the Inner Temple before entering the army. In 1703 he became a captain in the 2nd foot guards, in 1710, lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd foot guards, and in 1711 colonel of a regiment of foot. In Spain he served under his cousin General James Stanhope. In 1715 he became a colonel of a dragoon regiment (which he held for three years) and was elected MP for Derby on his family's interest. Although his active military career was over, he was once more colonel of a dragoon regiment from 1725 to 1730, and he continued to advance through seniority, reaching the rank of general in 1747. He did not stand for parliament again in the election of 1722 but sat for the borough of Steyning for a few months from April 1727, and in the general election of that year he was once more elected MP for Derby. A consistent supporter of the whig ministry, he remained in the Commons until his elevation to the peerage as Baron Harrington on 6 January 1730.<h2>
<a name="Diplomaticservice"></a>Diplomatic service</h2>A key element in the post-war policy of James, Viscount Stanhope, as first lord of the Treasury was to prevent an Austro-Spanish war over Italian territories. In August 1717 Colonel William Stanhope was sent as envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Spain, where he arrived in early October. Stanhope disliked Madrid, &#145;so dead and barren a place as to all engagements&#146;  (Stanhope to Henry Worsley, Madrid, 17 Dec 1717 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, BL, Add. MS 15936, fol. 146<i>v</i>). However, he seems to have pursued his mission energetically, though the Spanish foreign minister Cardinal Alberoni was intent on war. By early September 1718 talks had broken down, and Stanhope was warning both diplomats and the trading community of an impending war  (Stanhope to Henry Worsley, 9 Sept 1718 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, ibid., fols. 166&#150;7). On 17 November 1718 he set out for France, the Spanish king having refused to give him an audience of leave-taking. About this time he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1719), the daughter and heir of Colonel Edward Griffiths, who died giving birth to their son <a href="#cosubject_26258">William, later second earl [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>In May 1719 Stanhope was sent as plenipotentiary with the French army on the Spanish frontier and spent the summer campaign season with the duke of Berwick's army, his last active military service. In early December he returned to England, and through the patronage of Lord Townshend soon returned to Spain as ambassador-extraordinary and plenipotentiary. Stanhope arrived in Madrid on 18 June 1720, aiming both to counter the active Jacobites there and to persuade the Spanish king to withdraw his Italian pretensions. Philip V's fear of losing face was compounded by bouts of mental illness, in which he would try to mount the horses in the palace tapestries. Philip repeatedly refused to execute the terms of the Quadruple Alliance until Gibraltar was delivered to Spain. James, Viscount Stanhope, was not opposed in principle to restoring Gibraltar, and the king even agreed to persuade parliament over time to cede it in return for some equivalent. In the meantime, though, George I declared that he would continue the war ten years longer sooner than give it up. William Stanhope spared no pains to persuade Philip and the Spanish ministers that their demands were impossible, and George declared himself extremely pleased with every part of Stanhope's conduct in pushing forward a treaty of friendship with Spain. The monarch's approval was vital to a diplomatic career, and Stanhope gratefully acknowledged the king's thanks as &#145;the utmost that my ambition would ever aim at&#146;  (Stanhope to Carteret, 30 June 1721 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, BL, Add. MS 22520, fols. 152&#150;3). Though lamenting &#145;the proverbial dilatoriness of the Court of Spain&#146;, Stanhope used the latitude his instructions gave him to engage in creative diplomacy  (Stanhope to Carteret, 7 Jan 1722 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, New York Public Library, Hardwicke Collection 64). In late 1722 he was secretly discussing a possible exchange of Santo Domingo for Gibraltar, though without any real expectation of success. Stanhope's health was bad for some months in 1723, but his main concern at this time was the impending fall of his patron, Lord Carteret. Suspecting Horace Walpole of encouraging Benjamin Keene, the consul at Madrid, to spy upon him, Stanhope begged to return to England for a few months. His chief motive was &#145;to know thereby the true foot, upon which I stand with the Ministers, in order to take my measures thereupon for continuing much longer here or not&#146;  (Stanhope to Sir Luke Schaub, 22 March 1724 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, BL, Add. MS 4204, fol. 133<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In fact Stanhope continued in his Spanish embassy, succeeding that year, after &#145;a vast deal of trouble&#146; in prevailing on Philip V to soften enough towards the British merchants to issue a cedula for the annual ship  (Stanhope to Newcastle, Madrid, 15 Nov 1724 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, BL, Add. MS 9152, fols. 161&#150;3). Stanhope still had to convince Philip V that it was impossible for Britain as yet to restore Gibraltar. Consequently, his dispatches at this time were full of his frustration and even rage at the impenetrable, Jesuitical, and deceitful nature of diplomacy at the Spanish court. In summer 1725 he had to accept &#145;the almost utter improbability of avoiding a speedy rupture with Spain&#146;  (Stanhope to Townshend, 6 Aug 1725 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, BL, Stowe MS 256, fol. 34<i>r</i>). The dominance of the duke of Ripperda, &#145;a zealous Jacobite&#146;, who in December 1725 gained the title of first minister, gave Stanhope the opportunity to show his mettle as a diplomat  (Stanhope to Newcastle, 11/22 June 1725, ibid., fol. 14<i>r</i>). He had known the Spanish minister intimately for eight years and their conversations were frank and vigorous. In 1726 Ripperda was ousted by Don Jos&eacute; Pati&ntilde;o and sought refuge with Stanhope, who took him in, even though the embassy was surrounded by Spanish forces. After some negotiation, on 25 May 1726 Ripperda was given up, with all his papers, and placed in a tower of the Alcazar in Segovia. In the meantime he had been persuaded to disclose to Stanhope the terms of the recently concluded secret treaty of Vienna.<br>
<br>The Spanish court, with the empire and Russia, was planning an invasion of England, and Stanhope soon informed his court of the sailing of a well-provisioned fleet. This prompted Admiral Hosier's ill-fated expedition and the final collapse of relations between Britain and Spain. In autumn 1726 Stanhope had to placate Spanish resentment at the British ministry's decision to send a fleet along the Spanish coasts. He delivered a memorial that was on the whole pacific, but detailed and insistent. When an undeclared war subsequently broke out between Britain and Spain, the letters between Stanhope and the Spanish secretary of state, the marqu&eacute;s de la Paz, were published in a pamphlet that satirized the ministry's concerns about Spanish and Russian aid to the Jacobite Pretender, and blamed the war on poor diplomacy. A pro-ministerial answer attacked this pamphlet and its <span class="italic">Continuation</span> as the productions of Spanish agents, and claimed that the author of the latter was Daniel Defoe.<br>
<br>Before the rupture with Spain, Stanhope was ordered to stay long enough to procure intelligence and then to set off without a formal leave-taking. His conduct throughout was approved by George I, who affirmed that &#145;had it been possible for all the prudence and Attention that Man could employ, to have prevented their running into so wild and extravagant a way of acting, you would have succeeded in it&#146;  (Newcastle to Stanhope, 22 Dec 1726 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>, BL, Stowe MS 256, fols. 70&#150;71). Leaving Madrid with the unequivocal approval of his own king, Stanhope went to Paris where, in April 1727 along with Horace Walpole senior, he had a highly favourable audience with Louis XV. Soon after, he was the obvious choice to join Walpole as plenipotentiary for the congress of Soissons. According to the duke of Newcastle: &#145;Stanhope was thought on equaly by us all, is undoubtedly extreamly proper, is quite out of business, &amp; has nothing to do, &amp; upon the occasion expresses as he has great reason his gratitude to you for your goodness to him&#146;  (Newcastle to Walpole, 2 June 1727 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>, BL, Add. MS 32750, fol. 446<i>r</i>). Though he came to resent the &#145;Vast Expence&#146; of the posting, this was an important step in Stanhope's career. He got on well with Cardinal Fleury, and was active in cultivating those with news to give. His diligence and success were warmly commended by the new king, George II.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Stanhope was involved in discussions in late March 1729 at Lord Townshend's house, where it was decided that the plenipotentiaries should not go back to the congress unless the Spanish ministers were to sign the treaty. Stanhope now made his career needs known also to Walpole and the inner circle of ministers, and to the queen. He was denied the white staff of the royal vice-chamberlain, but Newcastle told him &#145;I find the peerage is still your favourite point&#146;, and this he was promised  (Coxe, <span class="italic">Walpole</span>, 2.643&#150;5). He was duly ennobled as Baron Harrington of Harrington, Northamptonshire, on 6 January 1730. His visits to London also brought about a liaison with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28083/', "Anne Vane")</script>, the eldest daughter of Lord Barnard, and a maid of honour at court. Town rumour held that the lady was very forward in the match, and the wedding day was even named in the <span class="italic">Evening Post</span>. Instead she became his mistress, then that of Lord Hervey, and later she had a son by the prince of Wales. Harrington was torn reluctantly from the enjoyment of his new love and new dignity to be sent once more to Soissons as ambassador-extraordinary and plenipotentiary, charged with securing full agreement from all the powers to the recent treaty of Seville. The diplomatic instructions were signed on 18 February 1730, and he set out three days later.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstate"></a>Secretary of state</h2>Shortly after, Harrington was picked to succeed Lord Townshend as secretary of state for the north, a fact revealed to some ministerial insiders as early as April 1730. He learned of the king's intention to confer on him the seals only a month later. He set out for England on 18 June <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, and on arrival he was declared secretary of state and gave up his regiment. At the height of his popular reputation, he was greeted with a published eulogy:<blockquote>
<div>I sing the Man who dares to Master Fate,<br>
</div>
<div>Who knew to merit first, and then be Great &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Hail, happy Fav'rite, of the best of Kings,<br>
</div>
<div>Great <i>Harrington</i>, all Hail, Louisa sings.<br>
</div> (Louisa [E. Boyd], <span class="italic">To the Right Honourable William Lord Harrington on his Late Return from Paris: a Poem</span>, 1730, 3, 5)</blockquote>Harrington expressed himself to Newcastle as &#145;extremely happy &hellip; upon the prospect of being joyn'd in office to one, upon whose friendship and judgement I can so intirely depend&#146;  (3 June 1730 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, BL, Add. MS 32767, fol. 326). With the Walpoles, Horace and Robert, however, his relations were more ambiguous. Horace Walpole found it necessary to assure diplomats abroad of &#145;ye most cordiall &amp; unalterable friendship between Ld Harrington &amp; me; and between our respective friends in ye administration&#146;  (Walpole to Sir Thomas Robinson, 9 Feb 1731, BL, Add. MS 23781, fol. 212). However, in the War of the Polish Succession which broke out in autumn 1733, Harrington favoured active support of the empire against France, while the Walpoles pursued a policy of non-engagement. He arranged a secret diplomatic mission on behalf of the emperor in which the bishop of Namur, Thomas Strickland, visited London, though this was thwarted by Horace Walpole's direct intervention with the queen. Horace complained of receiving from Harrington &#145;some expressions and some turns in his letters more cold and ungracious than I ever had in seven years during my embassy in France&#146;  (Walpole to Sir Robert Walpole, 22 Oct 1734 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, Coxe, <span class="italic">Walpole</span>, 3.184). In turn, he was critical of Harrington's overly complaisant manner in his diplomatic dealings: &#145;I am very sensible that your good breeding, and naturall disposition can't help being civill to ye De--ll if he waited upon you&#146;  (Walpole to Harrington, 20 Oct 1735 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University, Weston MSS, vol. 2). His civility was less of a handicap in high society, and Harrington was publicly celebrated as a model of true politeness. He had a reputation for discretion and taciturnity, however, as well as scrupulous courtesy: &#145;you know how tenacious Lord Harrington is upon subjects intended not to be divulged&#146;  (John Cope to Edward Weston, 28 May 1737, ibid.). The queen disliked Harrington, confiding to Hervey: &#145;There is a heavy insipid sloth in that man that puts me out of all patience&#146;  (Hervey, 2.346). The king in 1736 proposed to dismiss him, and would not take him, as was usual, to Hanover that summer. He may have owed his survival in office to the support of the Walpoles.<br>
<br>A severe test of Harrington's urbanity was the controversy surrounding the birth of a daughter to the princess of Wales. With Sir Robert Walpole he was a witness to the apology of Frederick, prince of Wales, for having hurried his wife, in labour, from Hampton Court to London. At the king's request, both men wrote down the prince's words, which Walpole incorporated into a pamphlet account of the quarrel in the royal household. The duchess of Marlborough, a bitter opponent of the ministry, commented on Harrington's plight:<blockquote>as he is a Man that has affected a great deal of Civility and fairness between Man and Man, He, it is said, has vex'd himself upon it &hellip; He might have done something to have taken off the Odium of being an Evidence: But I believe, not without losing his Places. Which is not to be expected from a Man, who has done so much dirty Work as to rise so fast without any great Parts. (Duchess of Marlborough to earl of Stair, 8 Nov 1737, James Marshall and Marie Louise Osborn Collection, Beinecke Library, Yale University)</blockquote>Harrington's finances continued to be strained, as he informed the king in June 1740, asking for a tellership of the exchequer, and citing &#145;The extreme streightness of my Family Circumstances, with the very expensive Way I am obliged to live in, &amp; the great Charge of my Children now grown up&#146;  (draft letter to George II, 14 June 1740, Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University, Weston MSS, vol. 3). Asking Walpole's help, he pleaded &#145;the very indifferent Prospect I have, whenever the Income I enjoy [as Secretary] shall cease, of being able to support Myself &amp; Family in any tolerable manner&#146;  (1 July 1740, ibid.).<br>
<br>In the ministerial divisions of the late 1730s Harrington aligned himself with Newcastle and Hardwicke in favour of the war with Spain that finally began in October 1739. Harrington flattered the king in his closet with pro-Hanoverian policy ideas and in 1741 he played an important part in negotiating the Hanoverian neutrality treaty, signed by George II without consultation with his British cabinet. When the ministry was rearranged on Sir Robert Walpole's fall, he was given an earldom on 9 February 1742, and on 17 February he moved to the presidency of the council and was replaced as secretary of state by Lord Carteret. Harrington joined with Newcastle and Henry Pelham in opposing the new secretary's war policies, and on Carteret's fall from office he became secretary of state once more, on 22 December 1744. In 1745, while in Hanover with the king, he explored the viability of a congress between the maritime powers and France that might settle the conflict and thwart Carteret's desire for a grand alliance against France and more general war. The contest over policy was brought to a head by Carteret and William Pulteney (now lords Granville and Bath), who strengthened the king's reluctance to bring William Pitt into the ministry, a stance which led to the mass cabinet resignations of February 1746.<br>
<br>Harrington was the first to confront the king and resign (10 February 1746), followed soon by Newcastle. He gravely offended the king by the manner in which he threw down the purse and seals, and never regained the royal favour. At the same time, in his pursuit of a peace on almost any terms, he was increasingly out of step with the Pelhams and Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, who favoured a vigorous war. In October he resigned once more, this time for good. His political prospects were summarized by the bishop of Salisbury:<blockquote>he was not well with the K[ing] upon the late resignations; cannot be supposed to be well with those he then helped to remove; is certainly ill with the present Ministry. What prospect then of his returning, unless by the fatal miscarriage of the measures which he has opposed? (Thomas Sherlock to Edward Weston, 3 Nov 1746, Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University, Weston MSS, vol. 3)</blockquote>His resignation, so Newcastle later told the king, &#145;was neither known nor expected by me, above twenty four hours before it happened&#146;, and arose purely from his opposition to the ministry's war policy  (Coxe, <span class="italic">Pelham</span>, 2.402).<h2>
<a name="Irelandandretirement"></a>Ireland and retirement</h2>With some difficulty the king was persuaded to appoint Harrington as lord lieutenant of Ireland in the room of his relative Lord Chesterfield, who became secretary of state. At first his conduct in this new office was approved by George II, and the country air even cleared up the gout which was increasingly troubling him. He was unlucky, though, in arriving in a country disturbed by serious rioting in 1747 and still agitated by a pamphlet war fomented by Charles Lucas. In August 1750 Harrington came to Pelham &#145;full of anxiety and trouble&#146;, having found out that he was not long to continue as lord lieutenant. &#145;He fears a sudden stroke, and thinks that if he is removed, before any thing else is allotted to him, he shall be left without anything at all&#146;  (Pelham to Newcastle, 24 Aug 1750, Coxe, <span class="italic">Pelham</span>, 2.380). Harrington indeed obtained no further post, despite trying to secure the privy seal. He anxiously asked Pelham if he had offended the king by his conduct in Ireland, and was told that his resignation in 1746 was the real problem: &#145;I owned sincerely to him, that I took the old affair to be the sore which I never saw healed, with regard to him, since the thing happened &hellip; At present he is calm, but very anxious as to his fate&#146;  (ibid., 2.381).<br>
<br>Harrington spent his few remaining years out of politics. He died on 8 December 1756. Despite his prolonged success at the centre of government, Harrington's finances were always insecure, and he lacked the patronage power expected of leading politicians. Lord Hervey's caustic summary of his position in 1733 put this in perhaps unfairly personal terms: &#145;he had reduced himself to a state of annihilation; he was absolutely nothing, nobody's friend, nobody's foe, of use to nobody, and of prejudice to nobody &hellip; He was forgotten in his eminence, seen every day, and never mentioned&#146;  (Hervey, 1.174). Hervey could also, however, see him in a more positive light: &#145;Lord Harrington's understanding had very odd luck in the world, for it was as much underrated after he came to be Secretary of State as it had been overrated before &hellip; His parts in reality were of the common run of mankind. He was well bred, a man of honour, and fortunate, loved pleasure, and was infinitely lazy&#146;  (ibid., 2.346). The younger Horace Walpole's summary was similar. Harrington, he said, &#145;understood both foreign affairs and the court; little of the constitution &hellip; He was very ambitious, civil, ceremonious, and a lover of pleasure. Never offended any party &hellip; was well with most&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of King George II</span>, 1.151). It was a lukewarm tribute, but one to which Harrington would have been too courteous to object.<br>
<br>Harrington's elder brother <a name="cosubject_26240"></a><span class="headword">Charles Stanhope</span>  (1673&#150;1760), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was educated at the Inner Temple and began his ministerial career in 1714 as under-secretary of state to his cousin James, first Earl Stanhope. He went on in 1717 to become secretary of the Treasury, and entered parliament as member for Milborne Port in July of that year. He came to grief through his zealous dealing in South Sea stock and promotion of the company's interests [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92793', "Promoters of the South Sea Bubble")</script>]. The Commons secret committee of inquiry acquitted him by only three votes, after the personal intervention of the king on his behalf. Stanhope's further advancement was put off in 1721, as Robert Walpole was convinced that it would revive the South Sea issue in the Commons if persisted in. Stanhope protested that &#145;this is the cruellest usage of me in the world, and is what must forever ruin my reputation and fortune&#146;. He could not gain his point, despite writing an impassioned letter to the king: &#145;what your Majesty shall now do must for ever determine my future Character and fortune in the World&#146;  (Stanhope to Newcastle, 19 Aug 1721, BL, Add. MS 32686, fols. 181<i>r</i>, 184<i>r</i>). Stanhope was elected to the duke of Newcastle's Aldborough seat in 1722, and from 1722 to 1727 he held the post of treasurer of the chamber. When George II came to the throne, though, Stanhope's hopes of office were ended. The new king found among George I's papers a memorial from Lord Sunderland, in Charles's handwriting, proposing to have the then prince of Wales kidnapped and held in exile. The king resolved never to employ Stanhope and resented Walpole's attempts to recommend him. Stanhope inherited the family estates from his elder brother Thomas in 1730, and went over to the opposition after his election for Harwich in 1734. He left parliament in 1741, and died, unmarried, on 16 March 1760.<br>
<br>Lord Harrington's son <a name="cosubject_26258"></a><span class="headword">William Stanhope</span>, second earl of Harrington  (1719&#150;1779), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 18 December 1719. Styled Viscount Petersham from 1742 until his accession to the earldom in December 1756, Stanhope was a soldier, entering the army as an ensign in 1738 and serving with distinction in the War of the Austrian Succession. He was a captain by 1739, a lieutenant-colonel by 1741, and from June 1745 until his death was colonel of the 2nd Horse Grenadier Guards. This prestigious command followed his distinguished service at Fontenoy, where he was slightly wounded. He was MP for Aylesbury from 1741 to 1747 and for Bury St Edmunds from 1747 to 1756, generally supporting the ministry. On 11 August 1746 he married Lady Caroline Fitzroy (1722&#150;1784), a noted beauty and the eldest daughter of Charles Fitzroy, second duke of Grafton, who as lord chamberlain was a close colleague of William's father, the first earl of Harrington. It was a striking match for one who had nothing but his commission to support him: &#145;neither he nor his father, Lord Harrington, have a single foot of land to make any settlement with&#146; (J.
