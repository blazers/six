<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hurry,  Leslie George</span>  (1909&#150;1978), <span class="occ">painter and theatre designer</span>, was born on 10 February 1909 at 53 High Street, St John's Wood, London, the third and last child of Alfred George Hurry (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;1951/2), funeral director, and his wife, Edith Louise Perry, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Butcher (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;1954). Sickly and perhaps unwanted, he was largely brought up by his elder sister. He remained devoted to her. At Haberdashers' Aske School (1920&#150;25) he knew he had to paint, and with his sister's help resisted pleas to join the family's undertaking business. He went to St John's Wood Art School (1925&#150;7), then won a five-year scholarship to the Royal Academy Schools, but left after his third year (1927&#150;31). A small allowance let him continue painting, including landscape murals for public houses. Between 1934 and 1936 he painted further watercolour landscapes in Britain and Ireland, which were exhibited in London and praised by Herbert Read  (<span class="italic">The Listener</span>, 31 March 1937). Commissions for more landscapes followed, but Hurry became depressed, feeling that his art lacked &#145;a rhythmic organisation of colour from the tensions between himself&#146; and his subjects  (Lindsay, 9). He fled to Thaxted, Essex, and sought ways to depict the workings of his mind within his increasingly abstract pictures. Many he destroyed. There followed moves to Brittany and then Paris, but illness forced him home. When war was declared in 1939, Hurry's poor health meant that he was not recruited; however, a flood of surreal paintings appeared. Waste, destruction, and the plight of humanity troubled him deeply, and even the portrait of <span class="italic">Grace Sholto Douglas</span> (1940; exh. Royal Festival Hall, 1990; Tate collection) shows the dying patroness, clad in crimson and with hands so like Hurry's own, looking away from strange ritual figures.<br>
<br>In 1941 Hurry had two London exhibitions; here dancer&#150;choreographer Robert Helpmann realized that Hurry's paintings matched his preparations for a dance-mime <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> for Sadler's Wells. The action was within the prince's dying brain, with characters and events overlapping. The nervous Hurry knew nothing of theatre, but agreed to submit designs, provided that Helpmann destroyed them if they displeased him. When <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> opened at the New Theatre in 1942, Hurry found himself &#145;greatly congratulated on his d&eacute;cor and costumes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Punch</span>, 3 June 1942). The phantasmagoric set, in blood-red and crimson, evoked a &#145;decadent palace&#146;  (Beaumont, 8), dominated by a Janus-faced figure, Revenge; all characters wore asymmetrical Gothic-style costumes in contrasting colours. <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> proved Hurry's intuitive grasp of stage design. In 1943 he designed Sadler's Wells' new <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span>, and was hailed for his &#145;quite outstanding imagination&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 18 Sept 1943). Three further Sadler's Wells&#150;Covent Garden <span class="italic">Swan Lakes</span> followed: 1952, 1965, and 1971. From the adventurous surrealism of 1943 to the autumnal romanticism of 1971, Hurry's <span class="italic">Swan Lakes</span> have influenced greatly fifty years' worth of ballet-goers.<br>
<br>Over a period of thirty-five years Hurry designed for major companies more than sixty productions, though he always stressed he was not a designer but a painter. Until 1950 he did just one show a year and his paintings flourished; partly influenced by designs, they placed a growing emphasis on mankind. <span class="italic">Bombers</span> and <span class="italic">War</span> (both 1944; exh. The Minories, Colchester, 1987; IWM) show war's destructiveness; <span class="italic">Atom Bomb</span> (1946; exh. Barbican, 1987; priv. coll.) his horror; and <span class="italic">Liberation</span> (1945; V&amp;A) owes much to his <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> schemes (see also Shakespeare's play, 1944, Old Vic at New Theatre). Two emotive oil <span class="italic">Self-Portraits</span> (1944; both exh. The Minories, Colchester, 1987; NPG and Tate collection) stress further Hamlet-like qualities. In October 1950 he joined a delegation of artists to visit Moscow, and later addressed the Society for Cultural Relations Between Peoples of the British Commonwealth and the USSR. Hurry was not a communist but was deeply egalitarian; this incident prevented him from entering the USA in 1955. It arose because the director Tyrone Guthrie staged Marlowe's <span class="italic">Tamburlaine the Great</span> (at the Old Vic in 1951), where &#145;the golden glory of Hurry's d&eacute;cor will haunt the memory of all&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatre World</span>, November 1951). This production was remounted in 1955&#150;6 for Toronto and New York; Hurry visited Canada but the United States banned him. By now he was designing full-time, including Wagner's <span class="italic">Ring Cycle</span> (Covent Garden, 1954) which let him buy his Suffolk cottage, fourteen Old Vic and five Sadler's Wells productions, plus new works like the set for Graham Greene's <span class="italic">The Living Room</span> (Wyndham's Theatre, 1953) and costumes for Lionel Bart's <span class="italic">Maggie May</span> (Adelphi, 1964).<br>
<br>In 1960 Hurry became a Royal Shakespeare Company associate designer; he contributed, among others, his &#145;sandpit <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>&#146; (1960&#150;62)  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Nov 1978). Urged to become more sculptural, he achieved this, particularly after 1964, by designing six productions for the thrust stage of Canada's Stratford Festival, Ontario. Included were Sheridan's witty <span class="italic">School for Scandal</span> (1970&#150;71) and a magnificent <span class="italic">Pericles</span> (1973&#150;4). His final Canadian commission was <span class="italic">Caesar and Cleopatra</span> (Shaw festival, Niagara on the Lake, Ontario, 1975). British design had ended earlier with Humphrey Searle's opera, <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (Covent Garden, 1969). Its rich, vivid, but fractured sets and costumes matched the paintings which again preoccupied Hurry. Still he tried to reflect, in their detailed sensibility, both the visible and psychological worlds he perpetually experienced. Landscape again reasserts itself, but the pictures now have a breathing openness, whether expressing regret in the surreal <span class="italic">Egypt/Israel War, October 6&#150;22</span> (1973; exh. The Minories, Colchester, 1987; priv. coll.) or delight in the more representational Suffolk scenes (1968&#150;78). When he died, his cottage was crammed with unseen works.<br>
<br>Tall, gaunt, and always breathless, Hurry's moods were volatile. In the theatre he could be very funny, very ironic, but always praised those who interpreted his designs. When painting, he still lacked confidence. Unmarried, he really trusted only a few women friends and his sister. He died on 20 November 1978 at the London Chest Hospital and was cremated a week later at Golders Green. His sister's son took his ashes home to Suffolk. In life, Hurry had paintings and designs exhibited throughout Britain and in Ontario, Canada; posthumously, major retrospectives have occurred. His paintings can be found in many British galleries, and his designs are well represented in London's Theatre Museum, Stratford upon Avon's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, and the Metropolitan Library's art department in Toronto.<br>
