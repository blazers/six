<span class="headword">Macpherson,  Ian</span>  (1905&#150;1944), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in Leslie Place, Forres, Moray, on 5 October 1905, the middle of three children, and the only son, of Ewen Macpherson (<i>b</i>. 1863), sheep dealer, and his wife, Mary, whose maiden name was also Macpherson (<i>b</i>. 1870). The family moved to a hill farm at Glensaugh, in Kincardineshire, and Macpherson was educated at Mackie Academy, Stonehaven, where he was dux in 1924. He went to Aberdeen University and in 1928 graduated with first-class honours in English, being awarded the Seafield gold medal. Professor A. A. Jack described him as &#145;the most distinguished student in the English classes during his four years' study in Aberdeen&#146;  (private information), and appointed him to a two-year post as his assistant.<br>
<br>During this period Macpherson wrote his first novel, <span class="italic">Shepherds' Calendar</span>, which is largely autobiographical, set on a Kincardineshire farm that is recognizably Glensaugh, during and just after the First World War, charting the adolescent development of John Grant. It was published in 1931, the year before Lewis Grassic Gibbon's <span class="italic">Sunset Song</span>, to which it has been compared; but the distinctive strength of Macpherson's novel lies in the acute psychological perception with which he delineates the triangle of forces within the Grant family, father and mother and son, and the very convincing picture of the day-to-day work of the farm.<br>
<br>In 1930 Macpherson was expected to go off to Cambridge to do postgraduate work to further his academic career, but instead he chose to take a remarkable change of direction. On 10 May of that year he married Elizabeth Cameron (1905&#150;1989), the daughter of the Revd John Cameron and the novelist Margaret Isabel Cameron, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Noble, and together they bought a van and spent the summer hawking fruit around Speyside. When winter came they found an abandoned and isolated cottage between Laggan and Dalwhinnie, where they spent the next six years, leading a hand-to-mouth but happy existence, during which period Macpherson did most of his writing. He also pioneered radio discussions with his friend and fellow author John R. Allan.<br>
<br>Macpherson's second novel, <span class="italic">Land of our Fathers</span>, was published in 1933, and is set virtually on his doorstep in Badenoch and Strathspey. It is a historically significant novel in that it is one of the first to deal with a theme, the highland clearances, which was to become important for other modern Scottish novelists such as Neil Gunn. The novel is centred on George Graeme, a borderer, and his struggle to establish his sheep-farming empire against local antagonism. Like Gunn, Macpherson is anxious to see the clearances as not simply a matter of good and bad. While Graeme rides roughshod over much that is valuable in the old culture, he does produce efficiency and a kind of prosperity. <span class="italic">Pride in the Valley</span> (1936) is in a sense a sequel to <span class="italic">Land of our Fathers</span>, in that it is set in the central highlands in the latter half of the nineteenth century, when sheep farming is itself coming under threat from afforestation and deer-stalking. It is a more bitter novel, with a strong sense of the betrayal of the people by the old chief, Cluny Macpherson, in the face of the new commercialism.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Wild Harbour</span> marks a new departure for Macpherson as a novelist, in that instead of being about the past it was about the future. Published in 1936, it is set in 1944, and Macpherson predicts the outbreak of the Second World War, questioning the possibility of isolation and detachment in the face of the horror. His two central characters go off to live in a cave in the highlands, but their sense of natural well-being is undermined by their feeling of betrayal of their kind. As the war intrudes upon them more and more, with armed deserters and marauders scouring the country, they decide they must return. The tragedy is that the dark destiny of modern man belongs to us all, whether we like it or not.<br>
<br>In 1936 Macpherson ended his own isolation when he took a job with a government agency, the Scottish Country Industries Development Trust, which involved his touring the south-west of Scotland, providing support for rural craftsmen. In 1938 he became tenant of the hill farm of Tombain, near Dunphail in Moray. He continued to produce regular journalism but there were no more novels. On 15 July 1944 Macpherson was killed in a motorcycle accident near his home. He was survived by his wife and two young daughters, and was buried in Newtonmore on 17 July 1944.<br>
