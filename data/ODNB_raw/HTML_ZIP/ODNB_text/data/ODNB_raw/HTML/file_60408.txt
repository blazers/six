<span class="headword">Cooper,  Giles Stannus</span>  (1918&#150;1966), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 9 August 1918 in Carrickmines, Dublin, the elder child and only son of Guy Cooper (1889&#150;1941), naval officer and colonial civil servant, and his wife, Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Warren (1888&#150;1977), a talented painter who had studied at the Beaux-Arts in Paris. Both families belonged to the Anglo-Irish landed gentry, with a tradition of service in the armed forces at home and in the empire, as well as membership of the Westminster and later the Dublin parliament. The Coopers, originally farmers from East Anglia, acquired large tracts of land in Ireland in the seventeenth century, though by the twentieth their estates consisted only of Markree Castle and a 1000 acre farm in co. Sligo. Giles Cooper's father, a younger son, trained as a naval officer, saw action in the First World War, then entered the colonial service and became attorney-general of the Seychelles. This establishment background throws light on Cooper's later devastating critique of post-colonial England and its disintegrating values.<br>
<br>Cooper's education, at Arnold House, Hampstead, London, Seafield School, Bexhill, Sussex, and Lancing College, conformed to a then-typical pattern for children of fathers serving overseas of boarding-schools and long separations from his parents. Apparently unperturbed by this regime, he enjoyed boxing, shooting, acting, and above all writing, especially for the stage, although a later play, <span class="italic">Unman, Wittering and Zigo</span>, presents a very dark picture of public-school life. His father, intending him for the diplomatic service, sent him abroad to learn modern languages, but after a post-school year studying French in Grenoble, Cooper decided to follow his own bent. Persuading his father to let him off Cambridge and the Foreign Office, he went instead to drama school, the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Drama, London. However, the Second World War broke out a few weeks after he qualified as an actor, and by 1942 he was an infantry officer on a troopship bound for Singapore. In Cape Town an ailment kept him ashore while his comrades sailed on unawares to years of Japanese captivity which few survived. Cooper himself was re-routed to Burma, where for two years his battalion fought under harrowing conditions in the jungle. He rarely mentioned his experiences there: he struck acquaintances as the typical &#145;officer and a gentleman&#146;&#151;courteous, cheerful, and excellent company while basically stoical and reserved. But just as outward convention veiled inner subversion, so beneath the laughter in his work and conversation lay a sombre view of human frailty owing much to what a relative has called his &#145;very nasty war&#146;.<br>
<br>Demobilized in 1946 with the rank of captain and a recurrent kidney weakness, Cooper started a modest career as an actor which introduced him to Gwyneth Lewis (1916&#150;1991), an assistant stage manager just out of the WAAF. She was the daughter of Canon Lewis of Llandaff Cathedral. They married on 15 February 1947 and had two sons: Guy (<i>b</i>. 1948) and Richard (<i>b</i>. 1955). Those were lean times for struggling freelances, but a characteristically jovial trait of Cooper's was to keep a supply of rockets handy for celebrating pleasant surprises.<br>
<br>One of these, after only moderate success with writing for the theatre, was the immediate enthusiasm Cooper met with as a script writer for radio. His first radio play, <span class="italic">Fools Rush In</span>, was broadcast in 1949, and thanks to the perspicacity of such BBC directors as Donald McWhinnie, Cooper soon emerged as a supreme exponent of pure radio, producing a seemingly inexhaustible stream of bizarrely original ideas carried out with virtuoso variation of form and technique. <span class="italic">The Disagreeable Oyster</span>; <span class="italic">Under the Loofah Tree</span>; <span class="italic">Unman, Wittering and Zigo</span>&#151;the very titles amaze. <span class="italic">Mathry Beacon</span> (1958), a realistic fantasy about a group of people maintaining a remote anti-aircraft gun-site long after the war is over, won the Prix Italia. In little more than a decade a score of Cooper's plays were broadcast on television or radio. He was made an OBE for &#145;services to broadcasting&#146;.<br>
<br>Cooper never gave up on the theatre&#151;<span class="italic">Everything in the Garden</span>, a corrosive debunking of suburban respectability, was staged by Peter Hall in London in 1962 and adapted for Broadway by Edward Albee after the author's death&#151;but Cooper's &#145;natural&#146; medium was radio. The apparently bourgeois points of departure that may have obscured his originality on the stage, in the &#145;kitchen-sink&#146; era of attacking the <i>status quo</i> from without, could on radio be suggested and outsoared within seconds, making way for a display of Cooper's distinctive dramatic economy. He exploited the possibilities of the medium to the full, his particular background and temperament adding a sardonic poise and elegance all his own. But on 3 December 1966, at a time when professional success and a family legacy had made financial worry a thing of the past, and he and his family were settled comfortably in rural Sussex, Giles Cooper died, at Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, following a fall from a train. He was buried in Heyshott, Sussex. His <span class="italic">Six Plays for Radio</span>, published in one volume by the BBC in 1964, is a revelation, not sufficiently remembered, of radio writing as literature. Cooper's work has also been already honoured by an annual award named after him.<br>
