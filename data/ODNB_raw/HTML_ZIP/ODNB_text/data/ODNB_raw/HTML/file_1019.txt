<span class="headword">Badeley,  Edward Lowth</span>  (1803/4&#150;1868), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical lawyer</span>, was the younger son of John Badeley MD, of Leigh's Hall, near Chelmsford, and his wife, Charlotte Brackenbury. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, at the age of sixteen on 14 January 1820 and graduated BA in 1823, taking his MA degree in 1828. In January 1841 he was called to the bar as a member of the Inner Temple, and for a short time went on the home circuit, but his inclination was for the study of ecclesiastical law, and he was soon employed in solving its intricacies in the Tractarian cause. Like his friends and fellow lawyers J. R. Hope-Scott and Edward Bellasis he was a devoted follower of J. H. Newman, whom he first met in 1837. In 1848 he appeared before the queen's bench on behalf of the objectors to the appointment of R. D. Hampden as bishop of Hereford. A speech by him in support of the prohibition of marriage with a deceased wife's sister was submitted in 1849 by E. B. Pusey to the commission then sitting on the law of marriage. When Henry Phillpotts, bishop of Exeter, refused to admit the Revd G. C. Gorham to the vicarage of Brampford Speke on the ground of his unsound doctrine on the sacrament of baptism, Badeley argued the bishop's case before the judicial committee of the privy council in December 1849, and his speech on this occasion was published as a pamphlet. In the summer of 1850 Badeley and thirteen other churchmen, including H. E. Manning, signed a series of nine resolutions to the effect that the views of the privy council on baptism should be solemnly disowned by the national church. No such action was taken, and Badeley joined the Roman Catholic church in 1852.<br>
<br>Badeley acted as assistant counsel to Newman at the Achilli trial in 1852 and thereafter frequently advised him on legal matters. It was on his advice that Newman rejected as inadequate the partial retractation of the charges levelled against him by Charles Kingsley and consequently embarked upon the composition of his <span class="italic">Apologia</span>. In later life Badeley was frequently consulted on legal problems regarding the administration of ecclesiastical trusts and charities, and in 1865 he argued the legal validity of the seal of confession in the case of Constance Kent. He was deeply devoted to James Hope-Scott and his family, and his letters to Hope-Scott, written at intervals of two or three days over many years, offer a vivid commentary on contemporary legal and ecclesiastical matters. In January 1868 Newman gracefully dedicated to Badeley his <span class="italic">Verses on Various Occasions</span> in gratitude for his staunch support at the time of the Achilli trial. Badeley died at his chambers at 3 Paper Buildings, the Inner Temple, on 29 March 1868.<br>
