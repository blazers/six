<div class="para">
<span class="headword">New South Wales Corps</span>  (<em>act. </em>1789&#150;1810), <span class="occ">army regiment</span>, was established in May 1789 to serve only in garrison in Britain's first antipodean colony. Three companies were raised by December 1789 and arrived with the Second Fleet in June 1790. Two more were added in 1791 and a further company was made up of men from the marines detachment already in the colony. At its peak, in 1802, the corps numbered 680 men (when the total population of the colony was about 5000) and at least 1640 served over the twenty years of its time in New South Wales. A large number were skilled men and, given that military duties were rarely full-time, played an important part in town life. This was made all the easier by the fact that large numbers either brought wives with them or lived with local women (mainly convicts) who could help in the management of their civilian affairs. Numbers of non-commissioned officers ran public houses, for instance, and were influential men within Sydney. Like the officers, the men and women of the corps therefore played an important part in the economic fortunes of the colony.<br>
<br>The corps's initial commander, and its colonel for most of its history, was <a name="cosubject_77020"></a><span class="headword">Francis Grose</span>  (1756&#150;1814)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 8 May 1756, the eldest son of the antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11660/', "Francis Grose (bap. 1731, d. 1791)")</script> and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jordan (1733?&#150;1774). Grose's military career had begun in 1775 when he was commissioned ensign in the 52nd regiment. He was promoted lieutenant that year. He served as a captain in the 85th and 51st regiments in the American War of Independence. A fellow officer in the 51st was Henry Phipps, afterwards third baron and first earl of Mulgrave, who became an important patron. Grose returned to Britain in 1779, after having received wounds in America, and spent two years as a recruiting officer. In 1783 he was placed on half pay as a major in the 96th regiment, where he remained until he was appointed lieutenant-governor of New South Wales and commandant of the New South Wales Corps in 1789. His first duty was the raising of soldiers, and he did not arrive at Port Jackson until February 1792.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsofthecorps"></a>Early years of the corps</h2>Grose appointed the first three captains of the corps in June 1789: <a name="cosubject_77021"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas Nepean</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1757, <em>d.</em> 1823)<span class="occ"></span>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21539/', "William Paterson (1755&#150;1810)")</script>, and William Hill. Nepean was baptized at Saltash, Cornwall, on 9 November 1757, one of the five children of Nicholas Nepean (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1772), an innkeeper, and his second wife, Margaret Jones. He was the younger brother of the highly influential <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19894/', "Sir Evan Nepean, first baronet")</script>, under-secretary of state in the Home department and a client of Sir Joseph Banks. Nicholas Nepean had joined the marines as a second lieutenant in December 1776, and after active service in the American War of Independence, like Grose, became a recruiting officer in the later phase of the war. On 21 April 1784, at Stoke Damerel in Devon, Nepean married Johanna Francina Carolina (1767?&#150;1845), the daughter of Major Wedikind of the 11th Hanoverian regiment; they had four daughters. His wife and children did not accompany him to Australia. He arrived in Sydney in June 1790 and was acting commanding officer of the corps until Grose's arrival.<br>
<br>The army lists show that more than seventy officers were commissioned into the New South Wales Corps between its formation in 1789 and its return to Britain in 1811. Of these, sixty-two men served in the critical years between their arrival in 1790 and the military insurrection against Governor William Bligh in 1808. They were not young; indeed, their average age on arrival in New South Wales was 29.4 years. The older officers included Thomas Brabyn (aged thirty-seven), the surgeon John Harris (thirty-six), and the irascible, ill-tempered Nicholas Bayly (thirty-five). The youngest officers were John Piper (aged nineteen), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17337/', "John Macarthur")</script> (twenty-three), and the Montreal-born Edward Abbott (twenty-six). These were primarily career officers who had developed networks of interest and commercial and social contact. Most officers had patrons. Bayly was the son of another Nicholas Bayly, MP for Andover, Hampshire, and was a nephew of Henry Paget (formerly Bayly), first earl of Uxbridge. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52447/', "George Johnston")</script> was under the protection of Hugh Percy, second duke of Northumberland, and <a href="#cosubject_61929">Joseph Foveaux [<i>see below</i>]</a> was the client of General Richard Fitzpatrick, second son of the earl of Upper Ossory. Patronage was a juggling act. A patron could never be taken for granted, and officers oiled the relationship with gifts of Australian birds, marsupials (especially wombats), and botanical specimens. Nothing in New South Wales which crawled, flew, swam, or burrowed was safe from being killed, preserved, and shipped to Great Britain.<br>
<br>The majority of officers were born in England, but there were three prominent Irishmen&#151;Lieutenant William Cummings, surgeon John Harris, and William Minchin, the adjutant at the time of the military mutiny in 1808. Paterson and Hugh and John Piper were Scots, Abbott was from Canada, and Francis Barralier was French. Among the English-born officers there was no geographical concentration.<br>
<br>The officers of the corps lived from the start in an uneasy relationship of conflict and co-operation. Macarthur attempted to have Nepean court-martialled on their arrival in New South Wales as the result of an argument during their journey, and John Harris attacked Nepean for using the men under his command for his own profit while stationed at Parramatta from May 1791. Aside from specific charges relating to conduct, officers were concerned with points of honour and duels were frequent. Macarthur nearly killed Paterson in 1801, and Nepean, Foveaux, and Hill were all involved in conflict.<br>
<br>The departure of Governor Arthur Phillip in December 1792 left Francis Grose in charge of New South Wales, and Grose's initiatives during this time provided incentives for the officers to involve themselves with the development of the colony. Grose made land grants of 25 acres available to serving members of the corps who requested them; he believed that encouraging the officers to farm would lead to New South Wales becoming self-sufficient. This had not been achieved by the time Grose left Australia in December 1794, but many officers had farming or surveying experience which played a prominent role in identifying fertile land. Several were committed farmers, and one officer, Archibald Bell, had wanted to bring his Alderney cow to New South Wales, alongside his pregnant wife and nine living children. The transport commissioners had found the whole project &#145;totally impractical&#146;. John Macarthur became a leading landowner and was the most prominent of the officers who laid the foundations of large-scale wool-farming in New South Wales; George Johnston, with the support from Britain of the duke of Northumberland, established Australian horse-breeding. Several officers had scientific interests which underpinned their economic enterprises. Grose's botanical concerns were recognized by his fellowship of the Linnean Society. Paterson had explored in southern Africa in 1777&#150;9 and became a fellow of the Royal Society. Macarthur showed a keen interest in the Aboriginal people and, like William Cox and Thomas Hobby in the Hawkesbury Valley (which began to be opened up during Grose's administration of the colony), was on good terms with them. This interest in the Aborigines did not prevent the corps from efficiently destroying resistance to British settlement in the Hawkesbury Valley, although Cox and Hobby seem to have been less bloodthirsty than their soldiers, who also held land in the area.<h2>
<a name="Changesinpersonnel"></a>Changes in personnel</h2>Francis Grose never returned to New South Wales; he was eventually promoted major-general in January 1805, when posted to Gibraltar. Twice, in 1808 and 1809, he applied to become governor of New South Wales, but was rejected. His first wife died on 12 January 1813, and he married Elizabeth Paterson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Driver (1760&times;75&#150;1825), William Paterson's widow, in April 1814. By this time he was a lieutenant-general. Grose died at his home in Croydon, Surrey, on 8 May 1814.<br>
<br>Nicholas Nepean had been dispatched to Britain in September 1793, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1814. He died at Newton Abbot, Devon, on 18 December 1823. William Paterson thus became commanding officer of the New South Wales Corps on Grose's departure. When Paterson returned to Britain on sick leave in August 1796, <a name="cosubject_61929"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Foveaux</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1767, <em>d.</em> 1846)<span class="occ"></span> took charge of the corps. Foveaux was baptized in Millbrook church, Bedfordshire, on 6 April 1767, the son of Joseph Foveaux, steward to the earl of Upper Ossory at Ampthill Park, Bedfordshire, and his wife Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wheeler. He entered the 60th regiment as an ensign on 10 May 1789, but on 5 June purchased a lieutenancy in the New South Wales Corps, advancing to captain on 6 April 1791. He arrived in Sydney in 1792, and in May that year was appointed commandant at Parramatta. By late 1793 he had begun a relationship with Ann Sherwin (<i>d</i>. 1840); they had a daughter, Ann Noble Foveaux (<i>b</i>. 1801), and eventually married at All Saints, Derby, England, in 1814. Foveaux was acting commanding officer of the New South Wales Corps from August 1796 to November 1799, when Paterson returned to Sydney. During his time in New South Wales he established a flock of 1027 sheep, which he sold in 1800 to John Macarthur on becoming acting lieutenant-governor of Norfolk Island. Foveaux established his reputation as an administrator by harnessing the scarce resources of Norfolk Island to reinforce the small settlement there, but in 1803 he had to apply the British government's order that part of the population of the overworked island be transferred to Van Diemen's Land. On sick leave in Britain from early 1805, Foveaux persuaded the British government to accept his plan by which the entire population of Norfolk Island should be transferred, with all property owners receiving compensation from the government but those of high moral character receiving a second year of convict labour, food, and clothing. Foveaux's plan was adopted by the government and implemented by Governor William Bligh, with resistance from the islanders. Foveaux was sent back to New South Wales in 1807, with orders to assume responsibility for the population that remained on Norfolk Island, but in the event he found the corps in mutiny against Bligh and assumed the government of the colony.<h2>
<a name="Socialrelations"></a>Social relations</h2>For the corps marriage was the exception rather than the rule. Grose had arrived in the colony with his wife and sister-in-law, and Paterson, Archibald Bell, William Cox, and William Patullo all brought their wives to Australia, but Nicholas Nepean had left his wife at home, and found a number of consolations in Sydney. Of other officers, Neil MacKellar had a long, loving relationship with Sarah Cooley, with whom he had two sons and three daughters; Adjutant Thomas Rowley had four children with the convict Elizabeth Selwyn; and George Johnston lived for many years with Esther Abrahams, a Jewish convict he met on the voyage to Australia, whom he finally married in 1814.<br>
<br>The regiment seems to have accepted relationships with convict or former convict women. However, Quartermaster Thomas Laycock suffered badly when his wife left him in 1805 because of a heated dispute over their housekeeper. Laycock threatened to fight his brother officers for calling his mistress &#145;an infamous strumpet&#146; and urged his son, Lieutenant Tom Laycock, to join him in &#145;calling them out&#146;. After thirty-three years in the army, Laycock was cashiered. More successful were Anthony Fenn Kemp, who after a number of liaisons married Elizabeth Riley, the sister of the merchant Alexander Riley, with whom he had seven sons and two daughters; and John Piper, who married the daughter of a convict, Mary Jane Shears, in 1816, by which time their family consisted of four boys and Sarah, the result of an earlier liaison. By 1826 the couple was able to commission Augustus Earle to produce two huge portraits, latterly in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In these the former officer wears a uniform of his own design, while his wife is resplendent in a red dress set off by a crown.<br>
<br>The officers were nominally Christian but most had little time for religion. William Hill's evangelicalism did not stop him fighting duels. Grose was an Anglican, highly suspicious of Methodists, and William Lawson, one of the conquerors of the Blue Mountains in 1813, was a devout Presbyterian. William Cox, who professed radical views, was sceptical of religion, but most officers saw it as a necessary and useful part of society, something akin to Voltaire's &#145;social cement&#146;.<br>
<br>Freemasonry attracted many officers. In 1802, during the visit of the French expedition led by Nicholas Baudin, Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp was received into the Rose Croix lodge, much to the chagrin of Governor Philip Gidley King. The informer against Fenn Kemp was Lieutenant John Brabyn, himself a mason, and a member of the secret lodge within the New South Wales Corps. Brabyn's lodge was loyalist and formally Christian, and opposed the advance of the secular, radical, republican French model of freemasonry introduced by Baudin. There is evidence in 1803 that both Paterson and Sergeant-Major Thomas Whittle were freemasons, and on Norfolk Island in the early nineteenth century Captain John Piper allowed a lodge to operate freely without government interference.<br>
<br>Politics was of great concern. Most officers mirrored the opinions of their patrons, but a number had well-developed political philosophies. Johnston, Foveaux, and Macarthur were whigs; Macarthur's plans for the economic self-sufficiency of New South Wales were influenced by the ideas of Jeremy Bentham. These opinions balanced the tory beliefs held by Grose and Paterson. Whigs and tories did not hold a duopoly. William Cummings, born in Ireland, was suspected of radical sentiments, and Ensign George Bond, probably a &#145;friend of liberty&#146;, was accused of being involved in a military mutiny on the convict transport <i>Barwell</i> in 1798.<h2>
<a name="TheoverthrowofBligh"></a>The overthrow of Bligh</h2>Sergeant-Major Whittle's egalitarian leanings contributed towards the mutiny that overthrew Bligh from the government of New South Wales in 1808. Bligh had ordered the demolition of Whittle's house as part of his replanning of Sydney. Whittle formed an alliance with Macarthur (who had resigned his commission in the corps in 1804), whose mercantile interests were threatened by Bligh's vision of an agrarian New South Wales. The two fanned opposition to Bligh among the soldiers. Macarthur's trial, for resisting Bligh's attempt to build on his land, asked the six officers who sat on the bench alongside Judge-Advocate Richard Atkins to condemn their former colleague for defending his property rights; the officers refused to condemn Macarthur. Bligh intended to charge them with treason, even though there was no court in New South Wales that could try the officers. The episode confirmed to Macarthur and his allies, who included Lieutenant William Minchin, one of the officers on the bench at Macarthur's trial, that Bligh intended arbitrary government, and legitimized any move to overthrow Bligh. As Macarthur directed the march on Government House on 26 January 1808, he told the troops that &#145;the Memorable day shall be the most Glorious day the New South Wales Corps ever experienced&#146;  (Atkinson, 289). Once Bligh was under arrest, Johnston assumed authority as lieutenant-governor, but real power was in the hands of Macarthur.<br>
<br>Joseph Foveaux returned to New South Wales on 28 July 1808, and instead of reinstating Bligh assumed the government himself, superseding both Johnston (whom he outranked) and Macarthur. Foveaux's rule enhanced his reputation for efficiency, seeking to reduce expenditure and restricting the liquor trade, but, while the British government's response to the mutiny accepted the end of Bligh's administration, it also envisaged the recall of the New South Wales Corps and its replacement by the 73rd regiment led by the new governor, Lachlan Macquarie. Macquarie was sworn in on 1 January 1810, assuming authority from William Paterson, who had superseded Foveaux as lieutenant-governor in January 1809. Some officers of the corps had feared that Macquarie would put them under arrest, but although Macquarie brought a proclamation communicating the government's displeasure towards the rebels, in the first months of his rule the new governor relied very much on Foveaux. Among Macquarie's early initiatives was one to promote marriage; of the 174 marriages in the first six months of 1810&#151;about equal to the number of marriages in the period 1807&#150;9&#151;two-thirds were of soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, who had to marry before returning to Britain or transferring to the 73rd regiment or the veteran company. The corps, renamed the 102nd regiment, departed for Britain during 1810.<br>
<br>Foveaux escaped a court martial and continued to rise through the army, being promoted major-general on 4 June 1814 and lieutenant-general on 22 July 1830. He died on 20 March 1846 at his home, 21 York Buildings, New Road, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London, alongside his wife. Many other officers and soldiers of the corps chose to remain in New South Wales; it is impossible to write the history of early Australia without acknowledging them.<br>
<br>The officers of the New South Wales Corps have been the subject of myth and legend. Most of the writing about them is antiquarian and anachronistic. Many did use their position to charge high prices for imported goods and employed the legal system in the colony to appropriate large estates, against the interest of the small settlers, but most would not have thought this unreasonable behaviour at the time, given that the soldiers went out to New South Wales to make their fortunes. They did not destroy morality and submerge the convict colonies in rum; it was true that several officers traded in alcohol, but others, such as Foveaux, used their positions of authority to restrict the business. Most were not men of the first rank, but it was they who laid much of the foundation of early Australia.<br>
