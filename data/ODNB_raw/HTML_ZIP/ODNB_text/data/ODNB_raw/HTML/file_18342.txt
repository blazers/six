<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Matthew,  Tobie</span>  (1544?&#150;1628), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was born in Bristol, the son of John Matthew of Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire and his second wife, Eleanor Crofton of Ludlow in Shropshire. The Matthew family had a long connection with the city and Tobie was said to have been born at Bristol Bridge, the heart of the mercantile community. The uncertainty about his birth date stems in part from the conflicting evidence of his own statements in later life&#151;though his funeral monument before its near destruction recorded 1546, he himself claimed in 1588 that he was just short of his third birthday when Henry VIII died and that his mother, who was still alive at the time, could verify the fact. It seems therefore that a birth date in early 1544 is most likely.<h2>
<a name="CareeratOxford"></a>Career at Oxford</h2>Matthew's parents are reported by John Strype to have been disaffected in religion, presumably meaning that they were Catholics. During Mary's reign Matthew attended school at Wells before proceeding to Oxford, where he is said to have matriculated as a probationer of University College in 1559. By 1561 he was at Christ Church, where the Scottish protestant James Calfhill, a cousin by marriage and a formative influence on the young Matthew, was a canon. He graduated BA in 1564 and MA in July 1566, by which time he was a student&#151;a fellow&#151;of Christ Church, and he was ordained deacon in the same year, apparently at the suggestion of Calfhill and to the dismay of his parents. Christ Church under the former exile Thomas Sampson was a strongly Calvinist college, and in 1565 Sampson was removed from the deanery for his objections to the imposition of the surplice and other vestments. Matthew wrote a lengthy letter to that great patron of godly Calvinists, Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, complaining about the government's action, and he remained a correspondent and friend of Sampson throughout the latter's life.<br>
<br>At this time Matthew was identified as one of the rising Oxford stars and &#145;he was much respected for his great learning, eloquence, sweet conversation, friendly disposition and the sharpness of his wit&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.870), qualities which were to play an important part in his subsequent career. More immediately they gained him a part, along with another rising star, Edmund Campion, in the disputation held before the queen in St Mary's Church on 3 September 1566, and he was chosen to make the oration on her departure from Christ Church at the end of her visit. His eloquence and presence attracted Elizabeth's attention, and she continued to show an active interest in his career thereafter, making him a royal chaplain-in-ordinary in 1572, soon after his ordination to the priesthood by John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, on 10 June 1571. By this time Matthew's Oxford career was becoming well established; he had been chosen as public orator by the university in 1569 and made a canon of Christ Church in 1570, succeeding to the stall held by his cousin James Calfhill. In 1571 he was presented to the rectory of Algarkirk in Lincoln diocese by Bishop Thomas Cooper, a former dean of Christ Church, and on 15 May 1572 he was appointed to the prebendal stall of Teynton Regis in Salisbury Cathedral. On 28 November in that same year he renewed his earlier connection with Wells on his appointment as archdeacon of Bath.<br>
<br>These promotions were chiefly intended to support Matthew's Oxford commitments, for on 17 July 1572 he was elected president of the recent foundation of St John's College, with which Christ Church was closely connected. He was the fifth president to have been elected in the college's short history and he had to grapple with its poor finances and a divided fellowship, among whom were many sympathizers with the old religion, including his long-time acquaintance the future Jesuit martyr Edmund Campion. Matthew was elected reader in Greek in 1573, in which year he also proceeded BTh. His attempts to improve the fortunes of St John's met with little success: he raised money in an attempt to found a library there but the plans came to nought, and the penury of the college undermined other developments. Matthew continued as a canon of Christ Church, and his work there led the college visitors in 1574 to complain that his cathedral duties prevented him from giving proper attention to St John's. He became DTh in 1574, and was given the stall of Combe IX in Wells Cathedral that same year. His reputation as a theologian committed to the Calvinist position and his links with Leicester's circle led to his admission to the godly legal community of Gray's Inn in London under special dispensation in 1575.<br>
<br>In 1576 Matthew was appointed dean of Christ Church and subsequently resigned the presidency of St John's on 8 May 1577. His new position at the head of both a chapter and a wealthy college made Matthew a formidable figure in Oxford, and his marriage early in 1577 to Frances Parker (<i>d</i>. 1629) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72735/', "Matthew, Frances")</script>], the widow of the late archbishop's son and the daughter of William Barlow, bishop of Bath and Wells, further strengthened his growing authority. Matthew was a vigorous dean who devoted considerable energy to building up the college library, making several gifts of his own, including a copy of the 1576 edition of Foxe's <span class="italic">Actes and Monumentes</span>, and encouraging others to follow his example. He was also active in university affairs, being a member of the commission to root out papists from Exeter College in 1578, and was appointed vice-chancellor in 1579, on the recommendation of the earl of Leicester.<br>
<br>It was through Leicester that Matthew also came into contact with two distinguished foreign scholars at Oxford. He was a patron of the Italian protestant jurist Albericus Gentilis, who had fled from Italy in 1579, welcoming him to Christ Church and subsequently defending his views on the legitimacy of the theatre against the more puritan scholars associated with John Rainolds, president of Corpus Christi College. In recognition of the support he had received from Matthew, Gentilis dedicated to him his <span class="italic">Commentarius de maleficis et math.</span> (1593); a copy survives heavily annotated by Matthew. The other visitor, Jean Hotman, arrived in Oxford in 1581 as an alumnus of Calvin's academy and the Genevan church, and was also provided with rooms in Christ Church by the dean. Hotman had a wide circle of Oxford contacts, and, although less closely identified with Matthew in person, was highly influential in introducing the works of Beza to Oxford protestants. It was in 1581 also that the greatest public confrontation at Oxford during Matthew's time took place, when Edmund Campion published his <span class="italic">Decem rationes</span> in defence of the Roman church, placing copies on the seats in St Mary's Church at commencements on 27 June. Campion identified Matthew, among others, as one not learned enough in scripture and the fathers to fulfil his office, a barb that Matthew underlined in his own copy of Campion's work. Although William Whitaker was chosen to respond officially to Campion, Matthew's was the first public response, in a Latin sermon based on <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span> 32: 7 preached in St Mary's on 9 October that year. The sermon gained some celebrity and circulated in manuscript until it was finally published as <span class="italic">Concio apologetica adversus Campianum</span> in 1638.<h2>
<a name="DeanandbishopofDurham"></a>Dean and bishop of Durham</h2>By the time of the sermon against Campion, Matthew was beginning to play an active if minor role in ecclesiastical affairs outside the university. As dean of the cathedral he had ordered the seeking out of papists in the diocese of Oxford (left vacant between 1568 and 1589), and in 1581, as prolocutor of the lower house of convocation, he was among those who unsuccessfully petitioned Elizabeth I to lift Archbishop Grindal's suspension, an act that secured the queen's displeasure. He was a natural candidate for further advancement (a view that he held himself), and when the deanery of Durham fell vacant late in 1581 he let his interest be known. The other candidate for Durham was Robert Bellamy, a member of the chapter and chaplain to Bishop Richard Barnes. Bellamy had the support of the queen's cousin Lord Hunsdon, but Matthew commanded the support of several godly preachers in the chapter, including the Pilkington brothers and Thomas Lever, as well as that of the earls of Leicester and Huntingdon and, most crucially, William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Despite such powerful backing negotiations took over a year and Matthew was not installed until 3 September 1583, resigning from Christ Church early in 1584. Matthew's departure from Oxford was the occasion of a celebrated sermon, and he was accompanied north by his friend Richard Edes who composed a lengthy elegiac poem, &#145;Iter Boreale&#146;, recording the event (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. B.223, fols. 1&#150;16). This was neither the first nor the last time that Matthew was to inspire verse: William Gager, a student at Christ Church, had already dedicated several verses to him (BL, Add. MS 10943, fols. 51, 68&#150;71, 74&#150;76<i>v</i>); he was later to be the dedicatee of Barnabe Barnes's <span class="italic">A Divine Centurie of Spirituall Sonnets</span> (1595) and of John Ashmore's translations of Horace's odes, published in 1621, while John Earle, the future bishop of Salisbury, composed a private elegy on Matthew's death in 1628 (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. poet. e.97, pp. 50&#150;53).<br>
<br>Matthew did not always view his promotion with pleasure, especially in the early years when his defeated rival proved a focus for opposition within the chapter and Lord Hunsdon's powerful influence still counted against him. He regarded the deanery as merely a stepping-stone to higher things, and his determined pursuit of promotion has left him, somewhat unfairly, with a reputation for ecclesiastical jobbery. Despite the presence of committed protestants in the chapter from the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, large areas of the diocese were still missionary territory, with the added complication of a shared border with a foreign power. Matthew was energetic in sustaining the preaching and pastoral effort required, mostly through personal example by preaching weekly at several churches in the diocese. In addition he exploited the opportunities to embellish the library that he had brought with him from Oxford by astute purchases from the estates of deceased members of the chapter. He made this resource available to local clergy engaged in combating recusancy, and was also assiduous in enforcing the laws against Catholics. As a crown appointee, Matthew was a trusted negotiator on its behalf with the Scottish authorities, and in particular Francis Stewart, fifth earl of Bothwell, in the years following the execution of Mary, queen of Scots. Trusted by the more advanced protestants on the privy council Matthew was hopeful of promotion to the see of Durham when Barnes died in 1587, but in the end Matthew Hutton, dean of York, was preferred, though the dean, still thwarted by his old opponent Hunsdon, was able to resist removal to the diocese of Salisbury and remained in the deanery. His income was subsequently increased when he was presented to the wealthy rectory at Monkwearmouth in 1590, which he held in plurality, but he continued to sue for promotion and was disappointed not to be made bishop of London in 1594.<br>
<br>The death of John Piers, archbishop of York, on 28 September 1594 occasioned another series of moves on the episcopal bench and Matthew was determined to succeed Hutton, the new archbishop of York, at Durham and not to be fobbed off with a less well endowed see. After some delay he achieved his ambition, being consecrated bishop of Durham on 13 April 1595, whereupon he settled his debts to his old patron Burghley, giving him &pound;100 in gold, with other presents to Burghley's secretary Michael Hickes and to his son Robert Cecil, a transaction that has been described as &#145;one of the more patently documented cases of simony in the Elizabethan Church&#146;  (Collinson, 47). At Durham, Matthew also looked after the interests of his family, most infamously in 1604 when he secured a lease of the extensive episcopal manor of Tunstall for his son Toby. Yet whatever may have been his dealings with his temporal estate, Matthew proved an assiduous bishop to a poorly staffed diocese in which traditional attitudes predominated and where less than half the parishes had preaching ministers and there was a high incidence of non-residence. He himself continued his preaching activity but &#145;neglected not his proper Episcopal Acts of Visitation, Confirmation, Ordination &amp;c. he confirmed sometimes 500, sometimes 1000 at a Time, yea, so many that he hath been forced to betake himself to his Bed for Refreshment &hellip;&#146;  (Thoresby, 165).<br>
<br>In addition to the demands of his spiritual duties, as prince-bishop Matthew played a prominent part in local administration in co. Durham and, following the death of the third earl of Huntingdon in 1595, was the <i>de facto</i> lord lieutenant of the county. As such he was soon engaged on the government's behalf in border affairs where the warden of the middle march, the 95-year-old Sir John Forster, had proved ineffectual in dealing alike with border raids and with recusancy among the local landowners. Forster was removed from office in 1595 with some difficulty, and on 25 September 1596 a border commission was set up with Matthew as its head. He played a key role in the Anglo-Scottish settlement of 5 May 1597, and preached regularly at Berwick while negotiations proceeded. Border affairs continued to occupy the bishop; he did not enjoy good relations with Forster's successor as warden, Ralph, third Baron Eure, who proved equally ineffective in controlling faction among the marcher gentry. Religion lay behind many of these disputes and the diocese contained many gentry with traditional values against whom the magistrates were unwilling to act and whose status rendered them immune from effective discipline by the bishop. Nevertheless it was during Matthew's years at Durham that concerted action was taken both against recusancy and to bolster protestantism.<br>
<br>Unable to overcome the gentry Matthew was assiduous in pursuit of missionary priests, and a number of them, including an old Oxford associate, John Boste, were executed during the 1590s. Matthew employed a network of spies to hunt down priests, led by the energetic Henry Sanderson, a customs official responsible for the disruption of a system of recusant safe houses, for which he was rewarded with the leases of episcopal coalmines. Matthew also secured the services of former priests to inform on their colleagues, the most famous of them being the prolific polemicist Thomas Bell, who was given access to the bishop's library in pursuit of his work. In order to promote protestantism Matthew successfully used his patronage within the chapter to secure preachers, and rather less successfully tried to make local patrons restore the fabric of churches and install resident preaching ministers in key border parishes after the Anglo-Scottish treaty of 1597. By 1601 this had only produced four licensed preachers in the whole of Northumberland, though almost half the Durham parishes had preaching ministers by that date. His efforts on behalf of the church were widely recognized and Archbishop Hutton thought that, on the death of Whitgift in 1604, Matthew might be promoted to Canterbury.<h2>
<a name="TheseeofYork"></a>The see of York</h2>As a key political figure Matthew occasionally antagonized local opinion by an over-assiduous attention to his own rights, as when he confiscated the goods of Scottish merchants at Durham in 1597 or when he contested the charter of the city in 1601, but he was a trusted servant of the state, and especially of the Cecils, and played a key role during the arrival of James I in England. Although his earlier negotiations do not appear to have given Matthew a high opinion of his new king, he quickly set out to make amends. He met James at Berwick, where he preached before him, and was in constant attendance as a preacher in the first four months of the reign, then returning north to welcome the new queen. He played a prominent part in the Hampton Court conference, preaching the closing sermon. He also preached before the king on the Sunday following the Gunpowder Plot, and before the English and Scottish commissioners upon the designed union of the two kingdoms. His advice was often sought by James in these crucial months. On 16 April 1606 he was appointed archbishop of York, a promotion that recognized his overall contribution to the national church and his effective administration at Durham where, by the time he moved on, protestantism had made significant inroads beyond the cathedral city, and the bishop had become the effective temporal ruler of the palatinate and the chief source of royal authority in the border regions.<br>
<br>Matthew's involvement in political affairs increased further through his work as archbishop with the council of the north, many of whose members were already good friends and shared his antipathy for Catholicism. He formed good relationships with the magnates Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury, whose funeral sermon he preached in 1616, and Francis Clifford, fourth earl of Cumberland, whom Matthew appointed as keeper of his estate at Scalme Park in Nottinghamshire and who, with his household, was a regular visitor to Bishopthorpe, the archbishop's principal residence. The secretary of the council, Sir John Ferne, was appointed steward of the archiepiscopal manors of Cawood, Wistow, and Sherburn, and his successor, Sir Arthur Ingram, was granted a long lease of the archbishop's house in the cathedral close, building there a substantial &#145;palace&#146;. Matthew remained on close terms with Sir Thomas Fairfax of Denton, whose lands adjoined the archiepiscopal manor of Otley and whose son Henry was briefly Matthew's household chaplain. Perhaps his closest colleague on the council, however, was Sir Thomas Posthumous Hoby, the strongest defender of protestant interests in that Catholic stronghold, the North Riding. Matthew trusted Hoby's local judgement, asking him to nominate curates to unprovided-for chapelries and supporting his actions in the secular courts with a vigorous campaign against recusants at the visitation of 1615. Hoby's actions did not always endear him to his fellow protestants in the region but Matthew continued to support him and in 1617 appointed him high steward of Ripon. This was an important post as Ripon was a parliamentary borough, which gave Hoby considerable political influence in what was a well-known recusant stronghold where the crown, with Matthew's encouragement, had recently attempted to strengthen the position of the established church through the re-endowment of the minster there.<br>
<br>During these years, largely through Matthew's efforts, a vigorous and active group of Calvinist gentry took over the effective running of the council, but their ambitions were threatened by the appointment of the pro-Catholic Emanuel, eleventh Baron Scrope, as president in 1619. Matthew, among others, let his disapproval of Scrope be known, with the result that in 1620 he was warned by James I to give the president due precedence at official ceremonies in York Minster. Though now in his seventies Matthew continued to be an active force in the north, but his influence on politics at the national level had waned by this date. He had preached the sermon at the opening of parliament in 1614, during which he indicated his opposition to royal policy over taxation, but his influence had probably already declined with that of his patron Robert Cecil, and dwindled still further with the latter's death in 1612. He entertained James I at Bishopthorpe on the king's journey north in 1617, and in 1622 he exchanged his London residence, York Place, which later became Whitehall, with the crown for the manors of Acomb, Beckhay, and Sancton in Yorkshire, further testimony to his close association with James but also, perhaps, a pointer both to his withdrawal from national affairs and to his tendency, previously noted at Durham, to accommodate lay patrons at the expense of the church's interests. His reputation for wit, too, may well have affected his reputation in temporal matters&#151;he has often had his own words to Matthew Hutton quoted against him by historians: &#145;God loveth, and so doe princes, a cherefull gever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 95).<h2>
<a name="Recusantsandseparatists"></a>Recusants and separatists</h2>Matthew's influence in ecclesiastical affairs remained crucial to the religious history of the north until his death in 1628. On arriving in his new diocese Matthew was faced with both the anticipated problem of recusancy and the less expected problem of separatism, each of which he addressed immediately. Matthew revived prosecutions against Catholics, using the high commission which in Hutton's later years had been less active, and he was deeply suspicious of the oath of allegiance, tendered to Catholics after 1607. In a sustained drive between 1612 and 1615 the high commission imposed heavy fines on the Catholic gentry, and a number of Calvinist clergy were appointed to confer with obstinate recusants. At his visitation in 1615 Matthew paid particular regard to recusancy, asking especially detailed questions, and his determined thoroughness in uncovering Catholics remained a feature of every visitation up to and including that of 1627. Ambition was not always matched by achievement, however, and despite his efforts many lay Catholics still found it relatively easy to evade the full force of the law, not surprising in a region where many court officers had recusant relations. Indeed, on the eve of his promotion to York, Matthew acquired one of his own: his antipathy to Catholicism was of long standing, but was given an added piquancy by the conversion of his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18343/', "Toby (or Tobie) Matthew")</script>, in 1606, an event that was a continual source of unhappiness to the archbishop and his wife until their deaths. Matthew also encouraged polemicists like Alexander Cooke and scholars like John Favour to take up in print the intellectual defence of the Reformation, making available to them his extensive library, and he encouraged godly preachers such as Edmund Bunny, who was based during these years at the episcopal residence at Cawood, to preach in towns throughout the province.<br>
<br>Separatism was a less expected issue. A number of clergy based in parishes on the Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, and Lincolnshire borders had failed to subscribe to the canons of 1604, and were cited before the ecclesiastical courts. It was against this background that the separatist preachers John Robinson and John Smyth had gained support from some clergy and from members of their congregations by the time of Matthew's arrival in the diocese. The new bishop sought to act against the separatists as swiftly as possible, trying to drive a wedge between them and the puritan clergy who had scruples over the canons. This he did in his primary visitation, adding one of the centres of separatism, Bawtry, to his preaching venues with a sermon specifically against the Brownists. He then placed the clergy of the area directly under his own supervision rather than that of the archdeacon, secured the subscription of the more moderate puritan ministers such as Richard Bernard, vicar of Worksop, whom he subsequently made a canon of Southwell, and picked off the leading lay separatists for prosecution in the courts. So successful was this strategy that in 1608 the congregations removed themselves to exile in Amsterdam.<h2>
<a name="Preacherandtheologian"></a>Preacher and theologian</h2>Using his authority to deal with the opponents of the church was only one aspect of Matthew's work; he was also active in sustaining the continued vigour of the early Calvinist reformers. By this date he was one of the few men left with direct experience of the struggles of the early Elizabethan church, and this no doubt informed his churchmanship. In addition to his support of godly writers and preachers he was a particular champion of that quintessential element of the reformed ministry, the exercise, in which clergy of a neighbourhood met to hear each other preach and to discuss matters of theology. He himself preached in that held at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in 1609 and 1613, while his chaplain John Favour was the leader of the famous exercise at Halifax, which exerted considerable influence upon the religious life of the West Riding in this and succeeding generations. It was during his archiepiscopate that the foundations laid by his predecessors began to bear fruit; a graduate preaching ministry became established in many parts of the diocese, and Matthew played his part in this through careful use of patronage within the minster as well as in the diocese. Only three clergy ordained by him at York were non-graduates, and even these had attended university.<br>
<br>The touchstone of the ministry as perceived by Matthew was preaching, an activity in which he was both pre-eminent and indefatigable. Matthew's preaching diary has become a standard source for the pastoral objectives of his generation of Jacobean bishops. In it he recorded those sermons preached by him following his appointment to Durham, 721 as dean and 550 as bishop, and then a further 721 as archbishop until 1622 when the diary ceased, though not the preaching. This was a weekly routine, and Matthew recorded his distress if illness prevented him from maintaining a programme of at least forty sermons a year. These included great occasions before court and parliament, and visits to small country churches &#145;through high waters and foul ways&#146; where congregations were sparse, though the situation he found on his arrival at Acomb on the outskirts of York in 1622 when there were &#145;neither priest nor people, although they had warning over night&#146;  (York Minster Library, Add. MS 18) appears to have been unique. The Pauline epistles often provided him with his text, and his industry was matched by his style, plain but elegant &#145;In that still voice, that voice that God was in&#146;, according to the poem by John Earle, himself a future bishop  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. poet. e.97, pp. 50&#150;53). Both in his audiences and by his example Matthew's preaching extended his influence well beyond his diocese, and this was strengthened further through contacts with other bishops, men like Arthur Lake and James Montague, and with university divines like Samuel Ward. To evangelical divines such as these preaching had to be based on scriptural learning, in the pursuit of which Matthew had acquired an extensive library of almost 3000 volumes by his death. It was acquired by gift, by assiduous purchases from deceased friends and colleagues, and from the Frankfurt book fair whose catalogues were marked up annually by Matthew with his requirements. Many of his books can be identified by his monogram, his motto <i>Vita Christus, mors lucrum</i>, and by his copious annotations, suggesting that he used his library regularly in preparing his sermons.<br>
<br>The collection reveals Matthew as a man of wide theological interests of an evangelical nature who, in addition to scriptural works and studies of the fathers, had a special interest in Italian works and in the troubles of French protestants during the wars of religion. He was clearly one of those who saw the English church as part of the wider protestant communion and as having a responsibility towards co-religionists elsewhere. His library was put at the disposal of other godly ministers, and the public purposes of print were formally acknowledged by him in 1602, when he gave &pound;50 to the Bodleian Library, and in 1615, when he established a library in his home town of Bristol, to which he continued to add from duplicates in his own collection until his death. These volumes can still be identified at Bristol, as can those of his personal library which he had intended to leave to his son Toby; however, having disinherited the latter, he bequeathed them to his wife, Frances, who subsequently gave them to the minster, where they formed the basis of the present library. The library was equipped and the books catalogued following a gift of &pound;40 for that purpose from Matthew's former colleagues on the council of the north.<h2>
<a name="Impactandlegacies"></a>Impact and legacies</h2>Matthew's career had been forged in the reign of Elizabeth, and his ecclesiastical contacts and pastoral priorities reflect that fact. However by the 1620s his brand of evangelical Calvinism was being challenged by the Arminians, whose style of churchmanship was very different. They already had some support in the chapter at York by the time of Matthew's death, when his generation of godly conforming protestants no longer commanded the heights of the established church, and he was followed as archbishop by a succession of Arminian churchmen in George Mountaine, Samuel Harsnett, and Richard Neile. By the time of his death the theological and pastoral priorities that had shaped Matthew's career, and indeed that of the church he served, were being replaced among the hierarchy by those of a younger generation of clerics whose attachment to Calvinism was much less strong, but Matthew's own care in the exercise of his office and of the patronage that it bestowed played no small part in ensuring that the churchmanship he represented continued to be attractive to a significant portion of both the parochial clergy and the substantial laity of the northern province in the decades following his death. That could not have been said of the archdiocese at the time of his arrival in those parts in 1583.<br>
<br>Matthew and his wife, Frances, had five children, three of whom survived infancy&#151;Toby and John, who also became a Catholic, and Samuel, who died in 1601 while still a student at Peterhouse, Cambridge. Both Toby and John were great disappointments to their father, who in his will recalled the large sums he had spent on them&#151;&pound;14,000 in the case of Toby. He bequeathed to each simple tokens of plate worth 20 marks. Perhaps surprisingly, Matthew left no money for public charitable purposes, giving the rest of his estate to the care of his widow, who died on 8 May 1629, &#145;relying with all confidence upon her care and prudence&#146;  (Borth. Inst., probate register 40, fol. 195). Most notable among his effects was the library of 3000 volumes, valued at &pound;600 and said to be the largest private library in England. In addition to his books, Matthew was reputed to have several manuscript pieces at his death and these seem to have passed to Henry Wickham, a canon of the minster and his wife's nephew, eventually coming into the possession of Archbishop John Sharp, but all that survives is an eighteenth-century copy of his preaching diary. The inventory of his Yorkshire residences, whose contents were valued at over &pound;3000, reveal a lifestyle in which hospitality played no small part, and Matthew was as much famed for this as for his preaching by contemporaries. Indeed his eloquence was central to both activities and he was celebrated for his puns, fine examples of which were known as &#145;Tobys&#146; among his circle in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Both preaching and hospitality were prominent features of the epitaph on Matthew's fine classical monument placed in York Minster. The monument was largely destroyed by fire in 1829, but an engraving was published in Francis Drake's <span class="italic">Eboracum</span> (1736) where the inscription is also recorded. All that survives is the much restored effigy, now placed on the north side of the lady chapel. Matthew's portraits reveal him as a small man with a thin face, and not the commanding presence described by contemporaries, thus perhaps providing further evidence for the power of his oratory. He died at his residence at Cawood on 29 March 1628 and was buried in York Minster.<br>
