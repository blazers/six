<span class="headword">Venables,  Edward Frederick</span>  (1815&#150;1858), <span class="occ">indigo planter and volunteer soldier</span>, was born on 5 May 1815, the third son of Lazarus Jones Venables (1772&#150;1856), barrister, of Liverpool and Woodhill, Shropshire, and his wife, Alice, daughter of Thomas Jolley of Liverpool. He early went to India as an indigo planter. He married in 1851 Eliza Power, daughter of R. H. Kinchant of Park Hall, Oswestry, Shropshire; they had no children. Venables, two elder brothers having died, inherited from his father in 1856 the family estates near Oswestry.<br>
<br>At the time of the outbreak of the Indian mutiny Venables was settled near Azamgarh in the North-Western Provinces. After the rising of the 17th native infantry on 3 June 1857 he left Azamgarh for Ghazipur. Some planters and clerks had been left behind, and Venables and another planter, M. P. Dunn&#151;&#145;two men cast in the heroic type&#146;  (Malleson, <span class="italic">The Indian Mutiny of 1857</span>, 184)&#151;determined to rescue them. No help was provided by the commissioner of the division, and when they set out on 16 June they had only a few Indian mounted constables, given them by A. Ross, the magistrate at Ghazipur. To these, however, Venables was able to add some of the tenants on his own estates at Dohrighat and a few refugees from surrounding villages. Having obtained the assistance of Ali Bakh, a collector, from within the town, Venables compelled the 13th irregular cavalry to abandon Azamgarh and reoccupied it. On 10 July he took the offensive against the mutineers with seventy-five mounted constables, an old gun, and a loyal Sepoy regiment. He stormed the police station and released his friends. When, however, on 16 July he attacked the Rajputs of the Palwar clan at Koilsa, he was deserted by his Sepoys and had to re-enter Azamgarh. Two days later reinforcements reached him, but most of them he sent to Ghazipur. On 20 July he marched out again with the rest, and, though compelled to retire before superior forces, the retreat, in which Venables himself led the cavalry, was so masterly that the rebels very soon retired from before Azamgarh. But on 29 July, under orders from Commissioner Tucker, it was once more evacuated, Venables retiring a second time to Ghazipur. But Azamgarh having been in August occupied by the Nepalese allies, Venables again took part in an advance on it. On 19 September, when the rebels were surprised at Mandori, he, though only a volunteer, commanded the cavalry, was first up to the first gun taken, and killed three men with his own hand. The mutineers then offered 500 rupees for his head.<br>
<br>Venables next rode as a volunteer with General Sir Thomas Harte Franks in his march from eastern Oudh to Lucknow, and rendered outstanding service. In the early spring of 1858 he had retired to Allahabad in broken health and spirits, and was looking forward to a return to England, when Lord Canning persuaded him to again volunteer his services at Azamgarh. His judgement and local knowledge were of great value to Lord Mark Kerr and Sir E. Lugard. With the former Venables re-entered Azamgarh on 6 April. While engaged in the pursuit of Koor Singh after his defeat by Lugard on 15 April he was mortally wounded, and he died four days later, on 19 April.<br>
<br>When, the following June, the Calcutta chamber of commerce met to consider a memorial to Venables, Lord Canning, the governor-general, wrote commending his intrepidity, energy, and calm temper, and his &#145;thoroughly just appreciation of the people and circumstances with which he had to deal&#146;. He was considered one of the heroes of the mutiny. His younger brother became heir to his estates.<br>
