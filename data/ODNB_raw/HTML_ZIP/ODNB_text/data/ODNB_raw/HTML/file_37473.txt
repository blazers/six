<span class="headword">Booth,  Eva Selina  Gore-</span>  (1870&#150;1926), <span class="occ">suffragist and poet</span>, was born on 22 May 1870 at Lissadell, co. Sligo, Ireland, the second of three daughters and the third of the five children of Sir Henry William Gore-Booth, fifth baronet (1843&#150;1900), Anglo-Irish landlord and Arctic explorer, and his wife, Georgina Mary (<i>d</i>. 1927), only daughter of Colonel Charles Hill of Tickhill Castle, Yorkshire. Of these five children two others also gave up their privileged positions in society to promote a new order in Ireland. The eldest, Josslyn, introduced co-operatives to Sligo and became the first landlord in Ireland to sell his land to his tenants after the 1903 <span class="roman">Land Act</span>. Constance [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37472/', "Markievicz, Constance Georgine, Countess Markievicz in the Polish nobility (1868&#150;1927)")</script>] became the &#145;rebel countess&#146; of the 1916 Easter rising.<br>
<br>Eva was educated at home by a governess, Miss Noel, who had studied at Cambridge and who grounded her in Latin, Greek, and Italian. She was antipathetic to her mother and was strongly influenced by her devout grandmother Lady Frances Lumley. Studious and introspective, she was quite different from her flamboyant and more robust elder sister Constance. In appearance she was willowy and frail, and she attracted attention with her fair hair and eager expression. The poet W. B. Yeats was thoroughly charmed by her when he stayed at Lissadell in 1894, when they talked of each other's poetry. The west of Ireland was not a suitable climate for Eva's poor constitution: an illness, suspected consumption, led her to travel to Italy in search of health in 1896. At the home of George MacDonald in Bordighera she met Esther Roper, an organizer for the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. This society was a branch of the national union organized by Mrs Fawcett, who was Esther Roper's mentor.<br>
<br>For the first time Eva was able to talk to a kindred spirit. Captivated by the woman and her cause, she impulsively decided to leave Ireland and join Esther in the suffrage cause in Manchester. At first under Esther's influence she devoted herself to trade unionism and suffrage, but then on her own account became involved in adult education for women, working with the Manchester University Settlement and the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Workers' Representation Committee. She became the mentor of the young Christabel Pankhurst in 1901, but after three years Christabel became irritated by Eva's gentle gradualism and pacifism and abandoned her friendship and guidance for militancy. Later Christabel quite unjustly damned Eva's character as &#145;temperament without direction&#146;  (Lewis, 97). It was clear to most contemporaries that Eva's work was thorough and painstaking, and maintained over years of campaigning. Roper and Gore-Booth were names prominent in campaigns on behalf of pit-brow workers, flower sellers, and barmaids, but their greatest success was in attracting large numbers of women from the working class to the suffrage movement. In 1901, when the membership of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) was about 10,000, they organized a suffrage petition with 30,000 signatures.<br>
<br>As a relief from her work Eva wrote a great deal, recording her dreams, and incorporating some of them into her verse and plays. She published ten volumes of poetry, including <span class="italic">Unseen Kings</span> (1904) and <span class="italic">The Death of Fionavar</span> (1916). Her best-known poem, found in many anthologies of Irish verse, was &#145;The Little Waves of Breffny&#146;. Her poems, from the first volume of 1898, in the publication of which she was encouraged by W. B. Yeats, dwelled on constant themes: Christian mysticism, love of nature, distaste for the &#145;iron fort&#146; of materialism, and for the militaristic urge to dominate and control. Horrified by the outbreak of the First World War, she was among the pacifist seceders from the NUWSS, which supported the war effort, and she worked tirelessly as a representative of the No-Conscription Fellowship for conscientious objectors at their trials by tribunal, and for the Women's Peace Crusade; this involved travelling all over Britain.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the Easter uprising in Dublin in 1916 Eva was instrumental in organizing the reprieve of the death sentence meted out to her sister Constance as one of the leaders of the uprising, but her campaign with Alice Stopford Green and others to prevent the hanging of Roger Casement failed. After the war her health broke down and she retired, with Esther, to Hampstead. During the last years of her life she was the leader of a group&#151;concerned to reform sexual behaviour and discard gender stereotyping&#151;that published the journal <span class="italic">Urania</span> from 1916.<br>
<br>Eva Gore-Booth died from cancer on 30 June 1926 at her home, 14 Frognal Gardens, Hampstead, London. In her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Evelyn Underhill claimed that Eva Gore-Booth would be remembered chiefly as a mystical poet, but on the contrary the dominant reminder of her is by W. B. Yeats in his &#145;In Memory of Eva Gore Booth and Constance Markievicz&#146;, written in October 1927. Here he unjustly commemorated her &#145;dreaming&#146; of a &#145;vague Utopia&#146;, her body and life wasted by politics. She was buried on 3 July 1926 in St John's, Hampstead, where she lies in a joint grave with Esther Roper under a headstone with an interlaced Celtic cross.<br>
