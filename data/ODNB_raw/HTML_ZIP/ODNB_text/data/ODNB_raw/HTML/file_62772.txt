<span class="headword">Macwilliam family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1130&#150;<em>c.</em>1230), <span class="occ">claimants to the Scottish throne</span>, descended from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8210/', "Duncan II")</script> (<i>r</i>. 1094), that is, from the first marriage of Malcolm III (<i>d</i>. 1093) and so from the ancient line of Scottish kings. But the family took its name from the king's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49370/', "William fitz Duncan (d. 1151x4)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8210/', "Duncan II")</script>], described in an English source as earl of Moray. The origin of William's claim on Moray is not clear. Alexander II's foundation at Elgin Cathedral in 1235 of a chaplaincy in memory of King Duncan might suggest that the latter had had a right in the area which could have passed to his son. Alternatively, it has been proposed that William's claim came from a first wife related to Angus, earl of Moray, who was killed in battle in 1130 when in revolt against David I. Angus had claimed the crown, and on his death without direct heirs any right he had to that would thus have passed to William fitz Duncan.<br>
<br>William fitz Duncan was strenuously loyal to David I, especially in the campaign of 1138 in the north of England against King Stephen, and no claims to Moray or to the crown were pressed by his heirs soon after his death. No Macwilliam is known to have taken part between 1154 and 1164 in the revolts of Somerled, lord of Argyll, or of a group of Scottish earls against Malcolm IV (1160). Nor were similar claims put forward at any time by the heirs of William's presumed second marriage to Alice de Rumilly (a son, William of Egremont, who died <i>c</i>.1165, and three daughters). But by the 1170s things had changed.<br>
<br>The death of Somerled of Argyll in 1164 and the division of his lordship brought instability to the western seaboard. No earl of Moray was appointed following William fitz Duncan's death, and after 1165 King William the Lion tightened his grip there. He named no successor as earl of Ross after the death of Malcolm Macheth in 1168. Royal government was extending its arm and some local lords, faced with this, preferred to support another line. In 1179 the king and his brother, Earl David, led an army into Ross. Two castles (mottes) were built at Redcastle and Dunskeath and measures were agreed to strengthen the defences of Inverness. The likely reason for the trouble is activity by the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49354/', "Macheth family")</script>, claimants to the earldom of Ross. Possibly the Macwilliams too were involved; they are reliably said to have been restive before 1181, when <a name="cosubject_62769"></a><span class="headword">Donald Ban Macwilliam</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1187)<span class="occ"></span>, a son of William fitz Duncan and an unknown mother, and by then the male heir of all the family's claims, took advantage of the absence of the king and his brother in France and led a full-scale revolt in Moray and Ross.<br>
<br>This uprising was a serious blow to the king, who was also at that time trying to restore order in Galloway. A later assertion that Donald Macwilliam controlled the earldoms of Ross and Moray for some considerable time seems to be well founded. The king is not known to have issued charters in Moray between probably 1179 and 1187, and there was no bishop of Moray for nearly two and a half years, from 17 September 1184 to 1 March 1187. A royal servant surrendered the castle of Auldearn and went over to the rebels. That a band led by Aed, son of Donald Macheth, was able to strike as far south as Coupar Angus in 1186 suggests how weak the king's position in the north was. In 1187, however, a major effort by the royal forces brought the rebels to battle on 31 July at &#145;Mam Garvia&#146; (unidentified, but perhaps north or north-west of the Beauly Firth). Donald Macwilliam and, it is said, 500 of his men were killed, and Donald's head was sent to the king.<br>
<br>After this defeat the Macwilliams, unlike the Macheths, are not known to have taken part in the unrest caused by Harald, earl of Orkney and Caithness, and his wife, Hvarflod (a Macheth), between 1196 and 1203. But a probable result of the expedition of King John of England to Ireland in 1210 was the expulsion of <a name="cosubject_62770"></a><span class="headword">Guthred Macwilliam</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1212)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Donald Ban, who, invited by the lords of Ross, arrived there with Irish forces in January 1211. Redcastle and Dunskeath were refortified; a foray by King William's army in 1211 accomplished nothing, and after its withdrawal one of the castles was surrendered and burnt. At a meeting of the Scottish and English courts at Durham in February 1212 the dispatch of mercenaries was probably agreed. Whether they were effective is unlikely; a little later in the same year Guthred was betrayed, captured, presented to the king's son, the future Alexander II, at Kincardine, and decapitated; the corpse was then left hanging by the feet.<br>
<br>In 1212 and 1214 Alan of Galloway and his brother Earl Thomas of Atholl attacked probable centres of help for the Macwilliams in Ulster. These measures and the death of Guthred were no deterrent. In 1215 there was an invasion (said to be of Moray, but Ross is more likely) by another <a name="cosubject_62771"></a><span class="headword">Donald Ban Macwilliam</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1215)<span class="occ"></span>; his exact relationship to Guthred is unknown. He was accompanied by Kenneth Macheth and the son of an Irish king. But the attacks on Ulster had had an effect; the 1215 invasion was probably weaker than earlier ones and the rebels were defeated in May or June by Farquhar Mactaggart (lord of Applecross in Wester Ross and later earl of Ross) without royal intervention; their heads were presented to the king on 15 June 1215.<br>
<br>The family's last fling was in the 1220s, possibly as early as 1223 but certainly by September 1228, when a certain <a name="cosubject_62772"></a><span class="headword">Gillescop Macwilliam</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1229)<span class="occ"></span> and his sons (again the exact relationship to other Macwilliams is unknown) fired a wooden castle in Moray, burnt part of Inverness, and about 8 September plundered some royal lands. William Comyn, earl of Buchan, was made responsible for law and order in the area; in 1229 Gillescop and his sons were captured and killed, and their heads were brought to the king. Then, or possibly in 1230, the last known member of the family, an infant daughter, was publicly put to death in Forfar, when her head was dashed against the market cross.<br>
