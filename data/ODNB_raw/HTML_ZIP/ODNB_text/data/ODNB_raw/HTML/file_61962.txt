<span class="headword">Smith,  Worthington George</span>  (1835&#150;1917), <span class="occ">architectural and botanical illustrator and archaeologist</span>, was born on 23 March 1835 at 19 Aske Street, Shoreditch, London, the only child of George Smith (1804&#150;1877), a civil servant from Gaddesden Row, Hertfordshire, and Sarah Worthington (1809&#150;1891) of Laxton, Nottinghamshire. Following an elementary education at St John's parochial school, Shoreditch, he initially wished to become an architect, and was apprenticed to A. E. Johnson of Buckingham Street, London, and later Horace Jones. With the former he designed ecclesiastical fittings for Roman Catholic churches, but the latter expected him to design drains. On 24 March 1856 Smith married Henrietta White (1831&#150;1917), a bonnet sewer from Dunstable, with whom he had seven children, only three of whom survived early childhood.<br>
<br>In 1861, disenchanted with routine architectural work, Smith became a freelance illustrator. Specializing in wood-engraving and lithography he prepared thousands of illustrations for <span class="italic">The Builder</span> and similar magazines. Soon, however, he turned increasingly to botanical illustration: his work appeared in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> (he was its chief illustrator until 1910), the <span class="italic">Journal of Horticulture</span>, and many others. Mycology became a major interest: he lectured and wrote books for the British Museum (Natural History) on fungi, and sometimes risked his family's life by involving them in sampling edible and poisonous varieties. In July 1875 he was credited with discovering the cause of the devastating potato blight fungus and was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Knightian gold medal. Six months later the German mycologist, Anton de Bary, proved that Smith had been mistaken and had not found the cause, but the British scientific establishment ignored his evidence and Smith was lauded for the next twenty years, sitting on several government commissions concerned with plant diseases.<br>
<br>Stimulated by reading Sir John Evans's <span class="italic">Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain</span> (1872), Smith combined searching for botanical specimens with seeking prehistoric implements. In 1878 he found a Lower Palaeolithic land surface bearing stone tools in commercial excavations at Stoke Newington Common, and soon traced it over a wide area of north-east London.<br>
<br>Following his heart problems, in 1884 Smith and his family moved to 121 High Street South, Dunstable. Despite the move there was no reduction in Smith's output of botanical drawings, or his work for the Natural History Museum. At that time he also began to observe the local brickearth pits. In 1890 he discovered another Palaeolithic land surface at Caddington, 2 miles from Dunstable, with flint tools lying where they had been discarded between 125,000 and 400,000 years ago. He published his London and Dunstable discoveries in an outstanding book, <span class="italic">Man, the Primeval Savage</span> (1894). The discoveries at Caddington were followed by others nearby at Whipsnade, Round Green, and Gaddesden Row. Of the five known British Lower Palaeolithic occupation sites listed in a comprehensive survey by Derek A. Roe (1968), four were discovered by Smith. His work encompassed numerous archaeological discoveries of other periods in the Dunstable area and beyond, as well as research in depth into the history of the town and neighbourhood, described in his <span class="italic">Dunstable: its History and Surroundings</span> (1904).<br>
<br>Ever impecunious, in 1902 Smith was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;50 per annum &#145;for services to archaeology&#146; on the recommendation of Lord Avebury and Sir John Evans; on 9 November 1903 he became the first freeman of the borough of Dunstable &#145;in appreciation of the eminent services rendered to his country in connection with his profession, and his munificent gifts to the Corporation of Dunstable&#146;.<br>
<br>Smith died of pneumonia at his home, The Hawthorns, 121 High Street South, Dunstable, on 27 October 1917, four months after his wife; he was buried on 2 November at Dunstable cemetery. In retrospect his mycological work was overshadowed by that of his contemporaries, but his archaeological research &#145;represents a pinnacle of Victorian antiquarian endeavour&#146;  (White, 913). In the late twentieth century Smith's work has attracted renewed attention, with re-examination and reassessment of his discoveries.<br>
