<span class="headword">Coryate,  Thomas</span>  (1577?&#150;1617), <span class="occ">traveller and writer</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6363/', "George Coryate (d. 1607)")</script>, rector of Odcombe, Somerset, and his wife, Gertrude (<i>d</i>. 1645), whose maiden name may have been Williams. Doubt about his year of birth arises from Winchester College's <span class="italic">Register of Oaths, 1576&#150;1639</span> (fol. 73<i>v</i>), which indicates 1579; Coryate himself believed 1577 to be correct. A scholar at Winchester from July 1591, he went up to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, in 1596, matriculating on 11 June, aged nineteen. He studied there for about three years and left without taking a degree, but with a retentive memory, much learning, excellent knowledge of Greek and Latin texts, fondness for rhetoric, aptitude for histrionics, curiosity to see the world, and a thirst for personal fame.<br>
<br>Coryate was acquainted with several influential families in the neighbourhood of Odcombe and refers to Sir Edward Phelips of Montacute and his son Sir Robert as his patrons. It was probably through them that he joined the household of Henry, prince of Wales. There he met many eminent people of the day, and played the role of unofficial, and probably unpaid, court jester.<br>
<br>In May 1608 Coryate sailed from Dover to Calais and made his way to Paris, which he found even filthier and smellier than London. At Fontainebleau he was befriended by members of Henri IV's garde &eacute;cossaise and saw more of the royal household than would normally have been permitted to chance visitors. He journeyed on to Lyons, through Savoy to Turin, Milan, Mantua, and Padua. His description of how Italians shielded themselves from the sun resulted in apparently the first mention of &#145;umbrella&#146; in English literature. Table forks, almost unknown in England, were in general use in Italy; Coryate acquired one, imitated the Italian fashion of eating and continued to do so frequently when he came home.<br>
<br>It is wrongly stated that Coryate's European travels were mainly on foot. He did walk extensively, often unaccompanied, carrying no weapons but a staff and a knife; one day in May 1608 between 5 a.m. and 6 p.m. he walked 36 miles. His other modes of travel were boat, horseback, coach, and cart; over the Mont Cenis Pass he was carried in a &#145;chaise &agrave; porteurs&#146;.<br>
<br>Arriving in Venice on 24 June 1608 Coryate presented two letters of introduction to the English ambassador, Sir Henry Wotton, who, perhaps impressed by the letter which mentioned that Coryate was remotely related to the earl of Essex, did him many kindnesses. These included rescuing him in the ambassadorial gondola from a threatening crowd of Jews who objected to Coryate preaching Christianity to their rabbi. Later he was to risk reprisals for antipathy to Roman Catholic rites and, during his Eastern travels, for proclaiming against Islam. After six weeks of intensive quest and recording of information, he left Venice on 7 August by boat to Padua, then walked to Vicenza, Verona, and Bergamo.<br>
<br>Coryate arrived in Z&uuml;rich by boat and reached Basel on foot at the end of August. While in Switzerland he heard the story of William Tell. Coryate's admirable rendering appears to be the earliest in English. Arriving in Strasbourg by boat he then got lost, alone and on foot, in the Black Forest, but the sole threat of armed violence experienced in Europe was from a German peasant, who resented Coryate picking grapes from a vineyard. He was hospitably received in Heidelberg and walked to Mainz. After a detour to visit Frankfurt's fair he sailed down the Rhine, with a brief stop at Cologne, and continued by water down what was the temporary truce line between the armies of Spain and the United Provinces. After calling on the English merchants established at Middelburg he was entertained by the English garrison at Flushing. Thence he embarked on 1 October and landed in London on 3 October 1608. With the rector's permission Coryate hung his shoes in Odcombe church.<br>
<br>Coryate drew on his experiences in writing <span class="italic">Coryats Crudities</span> (1611), which was intended to encourage courtiers and gallants to enrich their minds by continental travel. It contains illustrations, historical data, architectural descriptions, local customs, prices, exchange rates, and food and drink, but is too diffuse and bulky&#151;there are 864 pages in the 1905 edition&#151;to become a vade-mecum. To solicit &#145;panegyric verses&#146; Coryate circulated copies of the title-page depicting his adventures and his portrait, which had been engraved by William Hole and which he considered a good likeness. About sixty contributors include many illustrious authors, not all in verse, some insulting, some pseudonymous. Prince Henry accepted the dedication but insisted that all were published. There then appeared <span class="italic">The Odcombian Banquet</span>, a pirated version of the &#145;verses&#146; with a scurrilous preface. John Taylor may have been responsible; certainly thereafter he heaped versified ridicule on Coryate. <span class="italic">Coryats Crambe</span> (1611), presented as &#145;the second course to his Crudities&#146;, is a slim miscellany, including orations made to the royal family when Coryate presented copies of <span class="italic">Crudities</span>. According to <span class="italic">Thomas Coriate Traveller for the English Wits</span> (1616), Coryate belonged in the early 1610s to the Mermaid Club, a group of &#145;sireniacall gentlemen, that meet on the first Friday of everie moneth, at the Mermaide in Breadstreet&#146;  (<span class="italic">STC</span>, 5812). He was its beadle, and the members provided him with a mock passport before he departed on his Eastern travels [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95279', "Patrons of the Mermaid tavern")</script>].<br>
<br>On 20 October 1612 Coryate sailed for Constantinople. During a protracted voyage he visited, among other places, Alexandria Troas, then thought to be the site of Troy, where a companion dubbed him &#145;the first English Knight of Troy&#146;; he responded with an oration. Arriving in Constantinople towards the end of March 1613, he presented a letter of introduction to the English ambassador, Paul Pindar, who treated him kindly and during Coryate's ten-month stay frequently included him in his suite on state occasions. He now learned Turkish and Italian, the lingua franca of the Levant, having previously relied mainly on Latin; few but his countrymen knew English. In January 1614 he sailed from Constantinople, disembarking at Iskenderun, the port of Aleppo. On 15 March he left Aleppo to walk with a caravan mainly of Christian pilgrims, guarded against Arab attack by Turkish troops. After spending four blissful days in Damascus he arrived in Jerusalem on 12 April in time for Easter. There he toured the sights and, like many pilgrims, had crosses tattooed on his wrists. After visiting Nazareth, Bethlehem, Jericho, and the River Jordan he walked back to Aleppo.<br>
<br>Intending to write a great travel book, Coryate remained in Aleppo from May to September writing up his notes. He sent these home, where, drastically abbreviated, they were eventually published by Samuel Purchas in his <span class="italic">Purchas his Pilgrimes</span> (1625). Coryate's decision then to walk to India was primarily to confirm that the Odcombian Legstretcher, as he had been termed, was the greatest walker in the world. Joining an enormous caravan, he was robbed of much of his money at Diyarbak&#305;r, spent six days inspecting the ruins of Tabriz and continued via Qazvin to Esfahan. There he spent two months and left notes accumulated since leaving Aleppo, notes which disappeared. He joined another caravan in February 1615, walked via Kandahar, Multan, Lahore, and Delhi to the official Mughal capital, Agra, only to find that the emperor Jahangir was then resident at Ajmer, a further ten days' march. Arriving there in mid-July 1615 he measured his walk from Jerusalem: 2700 miles in ten months by his reckoning. He must actually have walked at least 3300 miles, during which he spent only 50<i>s</i>., seldom drinking anything but water, often living reasonably well for 1<i>d</i>. sterling per day.<br>
<br>Excepting Father Thomas Stephens, Coryate was the first Englishman to visit India with no thought of trade. At Ajmer he was warmly welcomed by the East India Company's servants and lived at their expense and that of Sir Thomas Roe, England's first ambassador to the Mughal court, with whom Coryate had become acquainted in England. In December 1615 Coryate accompanied the welcoming party which met Roe outside Ajmer, and made another oration. He earned his keep by entertaining Roe and the merchants with his tales. He explained his fourteen-month stay in Ajmer by the necessity to learn Persian and continue studying Turkish and Arabic. With these, and fluent Hindustani, he would travel, and solicit donations by flattering and amusing the rich and powerful. One of the two versions of <span class="italic">Thomas Coriate Traveller for the English Wits</span> published in 1616 was subtitled &#145;greeting. From the court of the great Mogul&#146;. About August 1616 he made an oration in Persian before Jahangir, who rewarded him with 100 silver rupees.<br>
<br>In September 1616, when Roe and his immediate attendants accompanied the emperor on his progress towards Mandu, Coryate resumed his wanderings, having sent a final missive to England from Agra on 30 October, published in 1618. He reached as far north as Kangra, and besides other places visited Hardwar, where the Ganges issues from the Himalayan foothills. He was back in Agra in July 1617 and continued to the ruined city of Mandu, some 400 miles to the south. There he found Roe installed in a deserted mosque and was introduced to his chaplain, Edward Terry, with whom he shared a room, and a tent when the emperor continued his progress towards Ahmadabad. Publishing nearly forty years later  (<span class="italic">Voyage to East India</span>, 1655 edn, 57), Terry gives a convincing character sketch, but is unreliable about Coryate's itinerary, confusing what had been achieved with Coryate's relation of his future plans. In November Coryate decided to leave the camp and make for the East India Company's factory at Surat in Gujarat. There, in December 1617, he died of dysentery, exacerbated, according to Terry, by the merchants plying him with sack. There is conflicting evidence about where he was buried. Coryate, yearning for lasting fame, dreaded lying in an unmarked grave, but the site of his interment has been durably, if inaccurately, commemorated because a large, domed tomb in the Islamic style, a landmark for sailors near the anchorage off Surat, is shown on British admiralty charts as &#145;Tom Coryat's tomb&#146;.<br>
