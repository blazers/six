<span class="headword">Porter,  Muriel Lilah  Matters-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Muriel Lilah Matters]</span>  (1877&#150;1969), <span class="occ">suffragist and feminist</span>, was born on 12 November 1877 in Adelaide, South Australia, the daughter of John Leonard Matters, a cabinet-maker, and his wife, Emma Alma Harburton. Educated at Adelaide high school, she ascribed an early interest in women's suffrage later in life to reading Ibsen's <span class="italic">Doll's House</span> at fourteen: &#145;I shall never forget my joy in finding that the sentiments I had always vaguely but keenly felt had been put into words, forcible, majestic, dignified&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Vote</span>, 19 Feb 1910, 196). She took a degree in music and became a professional actress and elocution teacher, and toured Australia and New Zealand. She seems also to have had radical political connections. In 1906 she came to Britain, initially for her musical career, but with an introduction to the anarchist circle centred on the exiled Prince Peter Kropotkin.<br>
<br>Muriel Matters rapidly became involved in the campaign for women's suffrage. Early in 1906 she was already attending meetings of the newly militant Women's Social and Political Union in Caxton Hall, London, being particularly impressed by the radicalism of Charlotte Despard. In 1907 she followed Despard into the breakaway Women's Freedom League and became one of its most visible activists. In the spring and summer of 1908 she took part in a league caravan tour of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, holding meetings often so lively that the women had to seek police protection. On 28 October 1908 she and Helen Fox were in the ladies' gallery of the House of Commons, then enclosed from the rest of the chamber by a metal grille, a standing affront to campaigners for women's rights. The two women interrupted the business of the house by demonstrating for women's suffrage; when officials made attempts to remove them, it was discovered that they had chained and padlocked themselves to the grille in such a way that in order to remove them the grille would have to be removed as well. They were taken to committee room no. 15, where their chains were filed off and they were ejected. Muriel Matters then went round to join the demonstration taking place in front of the houses of parliament, where she was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct and imprisoned for a month. On 17 February 1909, the day parliament returned from recess, she hired a pilot and an airship, which she had painted with the words &#145;Votes for Women&#146; and in which she flew from the Welsh Harp, Hendon, at heights of up to 3500 feet over central London, especially over the houses of parliament, scattering leaflets as she went.<br>
<br>Muriel Matters was later appointed Women's Freedom League organizer for south Wales, based in Carmarthen. During the first general election campaign of 1910 she moved her activities to Lloyd George's constituency of Dwyfor in north Wales. Later in 1910 she went back to Australia for about three months. By 1911 she was campaigning once more, this time in Buckinghamshire, on behalf of the Women's Tax Resistance League. She became increasingly interested in labour politics, in 1913 giving active support to relief work on behalf of families of those involved in the Dublin lock-out. In October 1913 she helped to persuade the National Federation of Mineworkers to declare in favour of women's suffrage; in this she was speaking for the constitutional National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, rather than for the Women's Freedom League. By this time she was also involved with the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage and the Church League for Women's Suffrage.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in August 1914 the suffrage societies effectively stopped campaigning, and on 15 October Muriel Matters married William Arnold Porter (1870?&#150;1949), a dentist, who had apparently proposed to her during the previous three years, despite his doubts about her suffrage activities; there were no children. Subsequently known as Mrs Matters-Porter, she none the less continued her political commitment and became organizing secretary of the British Committee of the International Council of Women, which in April 1915 was trying to overcome government refusal of permission to attend the International Woman Suffrage Alliance Congress in The Hague. She did manage to travel to Spain, where she trained under Maria Montessori; she returned to London to help run Sylvia Pankhurst's school attached to the Mother's Arms in Bow. In July 1916 she joined the Women's Peace Crusade in Glasgow, and after the war she spoke at meetings of the Glasgow branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. By this stage she was also active in the British Dominions Woman Suffrage Union.<br>
<br>By 1924 Muriel Matters-Porter and her husband were living in Hastings, where she stood unsuccessfully as Labour Party candidate in that year's general election. Montessori had alerted her to the way an unfavourable environment hinders education, and for her the most important issue had become the housing of the people, though she also favoured improving women's conditions through mechanizing the home  (<span class="italic">The Vote</span>, 12 Sept 1924, 289). In June 1926 she took part in the Peacemakers' Pilgrimage, together with a number of other members of the Women's Freedom League. Subsequently she seems to have become less politically involved, devoting much of her energies to lecturing and travelling widely. Her husband died in 1949, and Muriel Matters-Porter died of pneumonia at St Anthony's, 82&#150;4 West Hill Road, St Leonards, east Sussex, on 17 November 1969. She was buried at Hastings borough crematorium on 24 November. Her relatives in Australia were unable to attend her funeral there; however, members of the Suffragette Fellowship were present, witnessing to her importance in the women's movement.<br>
