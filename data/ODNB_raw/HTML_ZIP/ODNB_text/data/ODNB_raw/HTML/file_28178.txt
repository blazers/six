<span class="headword">Venables,  Edmund</span>  (1819&#150;1895), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, born at 17 Queenhithe, London, on 5 July 1819, was the third son of William Venables (<i>d</i>. 1840), a papermaker and stationer and alderman of London, who was lord mayor in 1826 and MP for London in 1831&#150;2. His mother, Ann Ruth Fromow, was of Huguenot descent. Venables was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from July 1830, and became the captain of the school. In 1838 he matriculated from Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was Stuart's exhibitioner and scholar in 1839. In 1842 he graduated BA, being third wrangler and fifth in the second class in the classical tripos. In 1845 he proceeded MA, and he was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford on 17 December 1856. While an undergraduate he developed an interest in antiquarian studies and shared in the foundation of the Cambridge Camden Society. In 1845 he became a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute and contributed many papers to its journal.<br>
<br>Venables was ordained by the bishop of Chichester in 1844 as curate to Archdeacon Julius Hare (1795&#150;1855), rector of Herstmonceux in Sussex; he remained there until 1853. In 1846 he was ordained priest by the bishop of Norwich. On 8 September 1847 he married at St Michael's Church, Highgate, Caroline Mary Tebbs, the daughter of Henry Tebbs of Southwood Hall, Highgate, a proctor of Doctors' Commons. They had one son and six daughters. From 1853 to 1855 Venables was curate at Bonchurch in the Isle of Wight; for some years after, he continued to live there, tutoring pupils. With the assistance of some local naturalists he compiled a guide to the island, which was published in 1860. Drawing mainly from the contents of this volume, he also published a shorter work entitled <span class="italic">A Guide to the Undercliff of the Isle of Wight</span> (1867).<br>
<br>Venables was appointed by Bishop John Jackson as his examining chaplain at Lincoln, and continued in that position when his diocesan was translated to London. In 1865 he was appointed prebendary of Carlton with Thurlby in Lincoln Cathedral, and in 1867 precentor and canon-residentiary. From that time Venables identified himself completely with Lincoln, haunting the minster and its library, and revelling in the antiquarian charm of the city, which inspired many occasional papers. An essay by Venables on Lincoln Cathedral was included in 1893 in a volume of <span class="italic">Our English Minsters</span>, and printed separately in 1898. He contributed an essay on &#145;The architecture of the cathedrals of England considered historically&#146; to J. S. Howson's <span class="italic">Essays on Cathedrals</span> (1872); and he undertook, though he did not live to finish, a volume on the <span class="italic">Episcopal Palaces of England</span>. This was published in 1895, with accounts of seven of the palaces being by Venables. He also edited the fourth edition of Murray's <span class="italic">Handbook for Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire</span> in 1882 and published an <span class="italic">Historical Sketch of Bere Regis, Dorset</span> in the same year.<br>
<br>Venables also edited theological and devotional works. In 1864 he translated Karl Wieseler's <span class="italic">Chronological Synopsis of the Four Gospels</span>, which was included in 1877 in Bohn's <span class="roman">Theological Library</span>, and he edited in 1869 a translation by his brother G. H. Venables of Bleek's <span class="italic">Introduction to the Old Testament</span>, reproduced in 1875 in Bohn's <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Library</span>. For the Clarendon Press series he edited in 1879 Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> and <span class="italic">Grace Abounding</span>; his life of John Bunyan appeared in 1888 in the <span class="roman">Great Writers</span> series, and in 1883 he edited Lancelot Andrewes's <span class="italic">Private Devotions</span>. He also contributed to William Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> (1860&#150;65), Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</span> (1875&#150;80), Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Biography</span> (1877&#150;87), the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, Kitto's <span class="italic">A Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature</span>, and to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. He was also a frequent writer for the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, and <span class="italic">Good Words</span>.<br>
<br>Venables died of influenza at the precentory, Lincoln, on 5 March 1895. His wife, who was suffering from the same illness, died the following day. They were buried on 9 March in the same grave in the cloisters of Lincoln Cathedral. Two of their daughters survived them.<br>
