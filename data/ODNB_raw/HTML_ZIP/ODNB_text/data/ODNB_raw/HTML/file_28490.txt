<span class="headword">Walker,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1841), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Edinburgh</span>, the son of Alexander Walker, was baptized in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, on 24 January 1770. He was tutored by Alexander Jolly (1756&#150;1838), bishop of Moray, and later attended Marischal College, Aberdeen, and afterwards St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1793, MA in 1796, and DD in 1826. He returned to Scotland in 1793, where he was ordained deacon in the Scottish Episcopal church. Later he became a sub-editor of the third edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, edited by George Gleig (1753&#150;1840), bishop of Brechin. About 1800 he became tutor to Sir John Hope bt, of Craighall, and for two or three years he travelled with him in Europe. While in Germany he sought the acquaintance of the foremost philosophers and men of letters, devoting particular attention to metaphysics. The article on Kant's system in the supplement to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia</span> was the result of his researches at Weimar.<br>
<br>In 1805 Walker was ordained priest by the bishop of Kildare, possibly to overcome the legal disqualification preventing those in Scottish orders holding a living in the Church of England. But in the same year he received the charge of St Peter's Chapel, Edinburgh, although he was always a scholar rather than a pastor; in 1808 he became dean of Edinburgh. On 30 November 1819, during a visit to Rome, he conducted the first regular Anglican service held in the city, for British residents. Eschewing proselytism, the service, using the English rather than the Scottish liturgy, was unofficially tolerated by Pope Pius VII.<br>
<br>In 1829 Walker resigned his charge of St Peter's to his colleague Charles Hughes Terrot (1790&#150;1872): chronic rheumatism made his health uncertain and he wished to conserve his energies for his recent appointment as the first Pantonian professor at the Episcopal Theological College, an office which he retained until his death. In 1829 Walker published <span class="italic">Sermons on Various Occasions</span>; he was also the author of several single sermons, and translated Jean Joseph Mounier's treatise under the title <span class="italic">On the influence attributed to philosophers, freemasons, and to the illuminati on the revolution of France</span> (1810).<br>
<br>Walker was the most distinguished scholar of his day in the Episcopal church, and his wide theological knowledge gave him great influence across the Episcopal church and with the bishops. As a result he was elected bishop of Edinburgh by the clergy of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Fife, and consecrated bishop at Stirling on 7 March 1830. As a native of the north of Scotland, with Scottish and English education, the appointment further consolidated the unity between northern and southern Episcopalians assisted by the appointment of his predecessor, Daniel Sandford, an Englishman. At the Episcopal synod in Aberdeen on 24 May 1837, on the resignation of George Gleig, Walker was elected primus of the Scottish Episcopal church, though his health made some of the burdens of office difficult. He died at his home at 22 Stafford Street, Edinburgh, on 5 March 1841, and was buried in the cemetery of St John's Episcopal Church, Princes Street, Edinburgh. He was married, and was survived by two daughters.<br>
