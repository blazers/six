<span class="headword">Lightowller,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1741&#150;1769), <span class="occ">coiner</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Lightowller, joiner, and his wife, Mary, of Walton-le-Dale, near Preston, Lancashire. His date and place of birth are uncertain but the parish registers of Walton-le-Dale record the marriage of his parents in 1721 and the baptism of their second son, Timothy Lightoler, in 1727. The brothers trained as joiners and carvers with their father but Thomas turned early to coining. In 1745 he was acquitted in Cardiff on a charge of coining. About five years later, when Thomas and Timothy went to Warwick to work on the interior of the castle, the former settled in Warwickshire. By 1751 he was married and two years later he rented a house in Coventry with his wife, Margaret (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Gill); a son, John, was baptized at Holy Trinity Church, Coventry, on 12 May 1755.<br>
<br>Overtly Lightowller traded as a carver, snuff-box maker, and &#145;engine turner&#146; but secretly he soon developed a thriving operation in the counterfeiting of gold and silver coins from mixed or base metals. Lightowller's contacts were extensive. His known customers for false coin, often food dealers whose trades were heavily dependent on cash transactions, included names from London, Banbury in Oxfordshire, and Stone in Staffordshire; in January 1755 Lightowller himself visited the Isle of Man to dispose of counterfeit coin. Both in the west midlands and Lancashire, furthermore, he trained others in the art of coining. Thus, when Abraham Healy the elder and Abraham Healy the younger were convicted of coining at Lancaster Lent assizes in 1756, the evidence given in court proved that Lightowller had not only counterfeited coin in the presence of the Healys but had supplied their equipment and instructed them in its use. Lightowller was apprehended in Coventry in May 1756 but he betrayed his accomplices and procured his youngest brother, Henry, to be admitted as an evidence against them. Partly on the strength of Henry's testimony Jonathan Tilley, a Coventry plumber, and Joseph Leigh of Bedworth were convicted of coining at Coventry summer assizes in 1756 and executed. Lightowller himself was tried at Lancaster summer assizes the same year on the indictment previously lodged against the Healys and, to the amazement of William Chamberlayne, the mint solicitor, acquitted. After being returned to Coventry to stand trial for coining there, he was discharged in 1757 because the attorney-general opined that &#145;the discoveries at Coventry having been made by means of Thomas Lightowller he ought not to be prosecuted&#146;  (mint solicitor's account, 1757, TNA: PRO, Tl/387/54). Lightowller subsequently went to Yorkshire, where he assisted his brother Timothy in the redecoration of Burton Constable Hall in the East Riding and then resumed his coining activities in the West Riding. In 1768, when several of his associates (notably Joseph Stell, executed at York) were apprehended, Lightowller fled the country and entered the service of Maria Theresa in Austria. There, by 1769, he had been granted 6 florins per day and a house in Vienna to set up flatting mills for the production of copper and iron plates and establish a variety of manufactures.<br>
<br>Lightowller's subsequent activities, and the circumstances of his death, are unknown. Alderman John Hewitt, who investigated the Coventry coiners, considered Lightowller the &#145;greatest mechanical genius&#146; of his time. He was, indeed, a fine carver and metalworker, but his talents were misapplied and his dissolute lifestyle and unscrupulous character rendered him untrustworthy even in his dealings with his business associates and accomplices.<br>
