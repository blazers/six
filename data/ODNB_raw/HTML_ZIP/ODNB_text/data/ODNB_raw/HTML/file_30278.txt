<span class="headword">Young,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1656&#150;1700), <span class="occ">forger and false witness</span>, had his criminal career to 1692, mainly as a clerical impostor, traced in unique detail through a dozen aliases by his intended victim Thomas Sprat, bishop of Rochester. Yet even Sprat could not certainly establish his origin. Young in different impostures claimed Chester and Warrington as his birthplace; the Irish bishops investigating his early frauds thought him a Scot; but a king's messenger met his father, a wandering fortune-teller and conjuror (evidently protestant), in Ireland, at Limerick. When imprisoned in 1681 Young mentioned a brother willing to stand bail. Young's spelling and dog-Latin discredit his occasional claims to have attended Enniskillen School and Trinity College, Dublin, or Magdalen College, Oxford. His real education was in counterfeiting handwriting and forging documents. He was tall, swarthy, and long-faced, with straight black hair.<h2>
<a name="Ireland"></a>Ireland</h2>In 1677 Young tricked John Roan, bishop of Killaloe, by forging certificates of his learning and moral character, into granting him deacon's orders. He then and later forged several letters of ordination for himself from Roan and other Irish bishops. In 1679&#150;80 he held three successive curacies, at Tallogh, co. Waterford, Castlerea, co. Roscommon, and Kildallon, co. Cavan, but soon fled from each for offences including forging bills of exchange, horse-stealing, fathering a bastard, and performing illegal marriages. He himself had in 1675 married Ann Apsly or Yeabsly, a yeoman's daughter of Ards, co. Cork; they had three children (two were dead by 1681). In 1680 (after attempts with other women) he bigamously married Mary Hutt, the daughter of a Cavan innkeeper, for her &pound;150 dowry. By 1681 he was in Cavan gaol awaiting trial for his life for bigamy. Since he might nevertheless genuinely be one of the more demoralized Irish Restoration lower clergy, Francis Marsh, bishop of Kilmore, degraded him from his clerical orders. From gaol Young wrote to both his wives, assuring each with exaggerated protestations that he loved only her, and persuaded them not to appear against him at the assizes. Still detained for unpaid prison fees, he gained release by offering to reveal to Lord Lieutenant Ormond further permutations of the Popish Plot, implicating noblemen and bishops (presumably including his protestant diocesans), but absconded <i>en route</i> for Dublin.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsinEngland"></a>Early years in England</h2>In 1683 Young fled to England with his second &#145;wife&#146;, Mary. (By one account they had two children, by another five who died.) Having failed to trick Archbishop Sancroft into granting him preferment, Young in mid-1684 forged a charitable recommendation from him, and the couple travelled as brother and sister collecting to ransom &#145;Mary Green's&#146; husband, a cleric captured by Moorish pirates. They were arrested at Bury St Edmunds, tried as cheats on 6 October 1684, and pilloried. Young had written to Sancroft a long, florid letter containing another false autobiography, expressing hostility to &#145;discentors &hellip; specially that damnable faction of Presbytery&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 12.1126), and blaming the forgery on Wright, a non-existent Oxford scrivener, but Sancroft did not recommend him to the judges, and Young vowed revenge. Imprisoned at Bury for a year, he again invented a plot to obtain release, petitioning James II and his parliament in May 1685 offering to discover whig conspirators including ten (unnamed) presbyterian ministers. He vindictively accused of treason a fellow prisoner against whom he and Mary unsuccessfully testified at Ipswich assizes.<br>
<br>In 1686 Young forged a fresh licence from Sancroft to beg, with which the couple, with new aliases and a new story, solicited successfully until the archbishop, alerted to letters which Young had forged skilfully enough (spelling excepted) to deceive three bishops intimate with him, inserted advertisements warning the charitable against &#145;Smith&#146; and &#145;Mrs Jones&#146; in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> in September&#150;October 1687. During 1688&#150;9 Young, having gained access to the mail at St Albans by corrupting the postmaster and his family, carried out large-scale forgeries of midland merchants' bills of exchange on London, until Mary Young was arrested there presenting one. With the proceeds Young posed at Lichfield as a refugee Irish dean, courted an heiress, and, when Mary inconveniently escaped from prison and arrived, allegedly plotted her murder. However, one of their victims had the couple arrested in December 1689. Tried in London on 15 January 1690 for two forgeries only, they were pilloried again. Young was also fined 200 marks (Mary Young only 20 marks) but, unable to pay, they were still in Newgate two years later.<br>
<br>Young, seeking release, yet again turned plot-forger. About Christmas 1691 he sent to Archbishop Tillotson forged treasonable letters from important men. Tillotson showed these to King William, but expressed his total disbelief, with which William concurred. Young would need a crisis to obtain a favourable hearing, and accomplices on the outside: the unexplained disgrace of John Churchill, earl of Marlborough, in January 1692 and the French invasion threat that spring inspired him.<h2>
<a name="TheFlowerpotPlot"></a>The Flowerpot Plot</h2>Jacobite and opposition writers hinted that the government ministers sponsored Young's plot, but their surviving private correspondence shows them as genuinely duped. In the paper he left at his execution, Young claimed that a surgeon imprisoned for debt called Henry Pearson had prompted him. A discredited plot-forger, John Capel, in October 1692 warned George Savile, marquess of Halifax, then in opposition, that two allies of Young were preparing to accuse Sprat and Halifax before parliament. Yet both these and Pearson may be as imaginary as scrivener Wright. In the false plots of the 1690s the inventor often initially remained in the background while a younger disciple made the accusations, a pattern compulsory here because Young, in Newgate, could not plausibly claim to have met his &#145;fellow conspirators&#146;. Young's accomplice, Stephen Blackhead, was a bankrupt tailor turned debt-collector, also tried for a forgery on 15 January 1690 and pilloried and imprisoned in Newgate for a year. He had avoided, by bribery, losing an ear as well; but his gaolbird looks made him an implausible Jacobite go-between to peers and bishops. Captain Lawe, another former fellow prisoner whom Young named as a witness (he himself and Blackhead, convicted forgers, were legally ineligible), never came forward.<br>
<br>Young's forgeries have disappeared, and Sprat's report is the principal source of information about them. The main one was a Jacobite association. Its promises&#151;to raise 30,000 men to assist a French invasion, to seize Queen Mary dead or alive&#151;were as absurd as its style, but the seven signatures were brilliantly forged. Of the victims, Sancroft had retired to his Suffolk birthplace, but Young, experienced in his handwriting, probably still wanted revenge. Giles Willcox, a nonjuring cleric already arrested for treason, might be frightened into becoming another witness. Accusations against the others might please their enemies across the political spectrum. Marlborough, Viscount Cornbury, and Sprat had offended both sides by abrupt changes of allegiance in or after 1688. The earl of Salisbury had turned Catholic to obtain James's favour. The tory London merchant Sir Basil Firebrace was notorious for extortionate avarice. Young obtained answers in their handwriting to letters written under various aliases and pretexts&#151;ironically, he had Blackhead carry to Sprat a query whether an (imaginary) curate had forged his orders&#151;and supplemented the association with forged letters from and between Sprat and Marlborough. Though the ease-loving bishop was an unlikely conspirator, he was made the central figure, drafting a declaration for James's invasion, because Young knew his palace at Bromley from a brief 1687 stint as curate at the local almshouses. Young sent Blackhead there again in Sprat's absence to hide the forged association in his study but, denied access there, he concealed it in a flower-pot in the servants' parlour.<br>
<br>Marlborough's arrest on suspicion on 3 May 1692, when the alarm of French invasion was at its height, led Young, timing his plot to a nicety, to demand a hearing from the cabinet. On 7 May he and Blackhead testified before them and, thanks to the forged Marlborough letters, were taken seriously. Both urged the messengers sent to Bromley to seize Sprat and his papers to search the flowerpots, gaining the affair the nickname the Flowerpot Plot. However, the search, restricted to Sprat's private rooms, fortunately missed the association, and for lack of solid evidence the bishop, after examination and ten days' house arrest in London, was allowed home.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Young got Blackhead to retrieve the paper, and renewed his accusations. Independently, the government's newest agent, Richard Kingston (later its best anti-Jacobite spy but, like Young, a loose-living clerical impostor), alleged on 1 June that Sprat was deeply implicated in Jacobite pamphleteering. The government freed the Youngs from Newgate on 25 May, a source of later embarrassment. On 10 June (when the victory of La Hogue had ended invasion fears) the privy council confronted Sprat, whose story his servants confirmed, with Blackhead, who finally broke down under interrogation. Young, arrested with him, now produced the association, and Mary Young supported his story. On 13 June, confronted before the council by Blackhead, who confessed everything, and the bishop, Young remained unabashed, accusing them of combining to stifle the plot and even denying that he had advised searching the flowerpots. However, the truth and Sprat's innocence were clear. One indirect beneficiary was Marlborough, bailed on 15 June, whose partisans then and since blamed his imprisonment merely on Young's accusations.<h2>
<a name="Aftermath"></a>Aftermath</h2>That autumn Young unsuccessfully tempted yet another former fellow prisoner, Richard Holland, to confirm his story of the association, and somehow arranged for fresh Jacobite forgeries to be hidden under the duchess of Richmond's hall floorboards. As Sprat deduced, had his first accusations succeeded he would have claimed many more victims.<br>
<br>&#145;Confessed: no; you shall find to your sorrow, all is not confessed yet&#146;, snarled Young when Sprat rebuked him; &#145;a parliament will come, and then you shall hear from me&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 12.1081). However, he had miscalculated politically. Marlborough had since late 1691 been intermittently allied with the largely whig parliamentary opposition, who denounced his detention. The false witnesses opposition whigs encouraged were those&#151;the most dangerous&#151;who accused government ministers of treason. Instead, the failure to prosecute Young at the October 1692 sessions, and Blackhead's escape from custody, encouraged genuine opposition fears that Young's perjuries might be government-inspired. Sprat began to share them. He had completed a narrative of his deliverance by 1 August, and most of a detailed biography of Young, with documents furnished by Sancroft and the Irish hierarchy, by early autumn, but heavy official pressure had restrained him from publication. Now both parts appeared successively in November. The skilful narrative and ample, damning documentation destroyed Young's credibility for good.<br>
<br>On 7 February 1693 Young was tried in the king's bench for the forgery. Charles Hatton wrote:<blockquote>by impudence [he] far outdid even D<sup>r</sup> Oates. He had not a ranting impudence, but a most unparalleled sedate composed impudence, and pretends to be as great a martyr for his zeale for the preservation of the present governm<sup>t</sup> as Oates did for his for the protestant religion. The jury without stirring from the barre found him guilty. (Thompson, 2.189&#150;90)</blockquote>He was sentenced to be pilloried three times (he was heavily pelted) and fined &pound;1000, to be imprisoned until he paid it, and meanwhile denied pen, ink, and paper.<h2>
<a name="LastyearskingsbenchtheFleetandNewgate"></a>Last years: king's bench, the Fleet, and Newgate</h2>Young remained in the king's bench prison (or, briefly, the Fleet) for nearly six years. The 1696 assassination plot inspired him, like other plot-forgers, to fresh activity, bombarding William and his ministers with miscellaneous accusations, including conspiracies by Sprat to destroy him. But his sting had been drawn: the lords justices, presented with a letter, &#145;would not so much as hear of such a villain as Rob. Young &hellip;, with all indignation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 1.665).<br>
<br>In both the Fleet and king's bench prisons Young had resumed his criminal career, now also forging leases while outside accomplices collected the money. After Young had escaped from the king's bench in December 1698, he and Mary, under the aliases John Larkin and Mary Robinson, carried on small-scale swindling of tradesmen. Arrested again, they were tried at the Guildhall sessions on 19 September 1699. He was fined 200 marks and she &pound;30, and they were committed to Newgate until they could pay.<br>
<br>Young still exploited his skills, getting a prisoner released by counterfeiting both the sheriffs' signatures. He now became involved with coiners, fellow prisoners, intending &#145;to accuse them, and to Witness against them, in hopes to purchase his liberty&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Post</span>, no. 134), since for each conviction the informer received a &pound;40 reward. For once Young was presumably truthful in claiming in his last paper that he had merely watched Daniel Jones coining money within Newgate, where he was arrested in the act on 14 March 1700. The calendar of prisoners for the April sessions listed Daniel and Mary Jones (the coincidence with Mary Young's frequent alias was evidently mere coincidence) to be tried for high treason for coining; &#145;Larkin&#146; and &#145;Mary Robinson&#146; merely had their former orders as convicts continued. However, in tackling a class of criminal accustomed to survive by unscrupulously framing colleagues, Young was again out of his depth. Probably the Joneses turned the tables by making clear to the authorities his real identity, for on 12 April he was convicted of coining, while they, as mere accessories, and another couple, the Iversons, were the witnesses. Young was executed at Tyburn on 19 April 1700, apparently penitent. He left a paper, supplementing Sprat's account of his life (since he lacked time to write, as he wanted, a full confession), admitting that the 1692 plot was forged, largely confessing his part in it, and mentioning his main swindles and accomplices since. Four months later, Mary &#145;Robinson&#146; was discharged from Newgate.<br>
