<span class="headword">Starkey,  Ralph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1628), <span class="occ">archivist and merchant</span>, was the second but eldest surviving son of John Starkey (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1613) of Darley Hall, Cheshire, and his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Ralph Dutton of Dutton, Cheshire. His family was distantly related to that of Thomas Starkey (<i>c</i>.1498&#150;1538), humanist and royal servant. While nothing is known of his education, Starkey was knowledgeable in English law, history, and politics, and skilled in trade. Ralph is said to have been defrauded of his estates on his father's death about 1613 by his younger brother Henry (<i>d</i>. 1653), who destroyed their father's will  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1623&#150;5</i>, 313). He petitioned the House of Lords in 1626 to settle the disputed will in the chancery because Henry wished to have it adjudicated in the court of the county palatine of Chester, where he had local influence. The Lords ruled in Ralph's favour  (J. S. Hart, <span class="italic">Justice upon Petition</span>, 1991, 44). Starkey married Winifred, daughter of Richard Poynter of Whitchurch, Hampshire, and his wife, Susanna. They had a son and two daughters. While he became a minor London merchant, he devoted his career to the collection and transcription of state papers and other manuscripts. He also attended several law readings at the inns of court, where he took notes.<br>
<br>An avid collector of old deeds, manuscripts, and coins, Starkey was also interested in collecting contemporary letters and official documents throughout his career. Since many of these were controversial, this occasionally caused problems for him and his family. In 1612 his wife wrote to Sir Robert Cotton for assistance against his &#145;enemies&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 7002, fol. 205). By 1619 he had acquired many important and confidential papers that had belonged to William Davison, secretary of state to Queen Elizabeth. The government, wanting to keep the papers secret, issued a warrant to Sir Thomas Wilson on 10 August 1619 authorizing him to search Starkey's house and seize Davison's papers. Wilson did this on the 14th, delivering to the government a sack containing forty-five parcels.<br>
<br>The more important manuscripts that Starkey collected for the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries included letters from Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, Sir Philip Sidney, and Francis Walsingham, papers on the laws, customs, and constitution of England, state papers, acts of the privy council, patents and charters, contemporary law cases, and papers concerning the economy. Many of his state papers were not included in the later collection of state papers domestic. He also left many family and personal papers. He copied numerous manuscripts from Cotton's library, which he initialled while residing there, lending Cotton many manuscripts that were not returned. The authorship of some of the parliamentary diaries of James's reign, extant in Starkey's hand, are still in dispute  (K. Sharpe, <span class="italic">Sir Robert Cotton</span>, 1979, 251&#150;2), however he did compose a treatise on the high court of parliament. The treatise was similar to many others under the same title in the period, and it is not altogether clear how much of it was his own work. A collection of precedents and procedural devices, it was intended perhaps for a London audience. It was used throughout the parliamentary debates of the first half of the seventeenth century, which accounts for the survival of so many copies in various archival collections.<br>
<br>Starkey died in October 1628 at his Bloomsbury residence. According to a commission for the execution of his will issued to his daughter Elizabeth at his house in St Giles-in-the-Fields, Middlesex, he left goods and chattels valued at &pound;58 2<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. There was competition for his papers, and D'Ewes bought most of them for &pound;140 in an agreement with Arthur Barnardiston, Ambrose Scudamore, and Nicholas Bragge on 22 October 1628. D'Ewes's grandson sold them to Sir Robert Harley, and they are now in the Harley collection at the British Library. Others went to Sir Edward Dering, and ended up in the Additional MSS collection. According to D'Ewes, Starkey was &#145;an ignorant, mercenary, indigent man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.391). This was an uncharitable comment from the benefactor of a lifelong collector, and may have more to do with Starkey's success, nurtured by an independent career as a London merchant.<br>
