<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heatley,  Norman George</span>  (1911&#150;2004), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 10 January 1911 at Marton Place, Woodbridge, Suffolk, the only child of Thomas George Heatley, veterinary surgeon, and his wife, Grace Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Symonds. His mother, who was an invalid, left her young son very much to his own devices. At the age of six he was sent away to St Felix School, Southwold, which he later described as &#145;like <span class="italic">Lord of the Flies</span>&#146;. He was saved by the family doctor who suggested that he should be moved to a school near to the sea. The selected school, Westbourne House, was a great success. There an inspiring visiting science teacher named Ullyatt instilled a lifelong interest in practical science. He moved on to the Grange School at Folkestone and then to Tonbridge School, where his interest in science was consolidated. At St John's, Cambridge, his talents were further developed and, after graduating in natural sciences with an upper second in 1933, he stayed on to do research for a PhD degree in biochemistry in Gowland Hopkins's laboratory. In 1936, soon after completing his doctorate, he was invited to move to Oxford to work with Ernst Chain and Howard Florey in the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, where he was to spend the rest of his working life.<br>
<br>Alexander Fleming had &#145;discovered&#146; penicillin, essentially by accident, in 1928, but he and his colleagues found that the culture extract containing penicillin was unstable and the antibiotic was impossible to isolate in a pure state, and so they effectively gave up research on it. Only when Florey and Chain decided to work on antibacterial substances in 1938 was serious research on penicillin resumed. When its importance became apparent in 1940, after the results of experiments on mice were published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, Fleming contacted Florey and visited Oxford to learn more about the breakthrough. (At this time Chain is reputed to have said that he thought Fleming was already dead.) But St Mary's Hospital (where Fleming was based) realized the enormous publicity value of their link with penicillin. Charles Wilson, the dean, and Lord Beaverbrook together were prominent in encouraging the press to publicize and exaggerate the contribution of Fleming and to play down the importance of the Oxford work. Florey himself must bear some responsibility for the distorted stories put out by the media because he consistently refused to speak to them and forbade his colleagues to do so. Nevertheless, in a Florey centenary lecture given in 1998 Sir Henry Harris (Florey's successor as professor of pathology at Oxford) succinctly summed up by saying: &#145;without Fleming, no Florey or Chain, without Chain no Florey, without Florey no Heatley, without Heatley no penicillin&#146;  (Harris, 249).<br>
<br>The problem that had defeated Fleming and his colleagues was that there was no simple way to extract and purify the penicillin from the culture fluid or to measure its activity. Heatley's genius for improvisation and invention solved both these problems. He found appropriate conditions under which penicillin was stable and applied a multi-stage technique to isolate it from the culture fluid and to concentrate it. The procedure was automated, using a &#145;Heath Robinson&#146; set-up of bath, milk churns, petrol cans, biscuit-tin lids, and so on, and yards of glass and rubber tubing. Despite its improvisation, the basic principles of the method continued to be used thereafter to produce penicillin. Heatley also devised a new assay method that measured the activity of penicillin precisely, in what became known as &#145;Oxford units&#146;. In addition he played a key role with Florey in the first experiments in May 1940, which demonstrated the remarkable power of penicillin to cure infected animals. From these it was clear that a trial of treatment in human patients was urgently needed. But a human is 3000 times larger than a mouse and the amount needed to treat humans required large-scale production, which in wartime no commercial firm in Britain was willing to undertake. The Dunn School was therefore turned into a production factory utilizing several hundred Heatley-designed ceramic &#145;bedpans&#146; for the growth of the penicillium cultures and employing a team of six &#145;penicillin girls&#146;. After extraction and purification the dry powder produced was still less than 1 per cent pure, but it was nevertheless deemed suitable for a clinical trial. In early 1941 the first patients were treated and it was immediately clear that penicillin really was a &#145;miracle drug&#146;. The results were published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in August 1941. By then it was obvious that penicillin could make a very important contribution to the war effort, and to the morale of injured troops. But increasing the yield of the batches of antibiotic was impossible without industrial-scale production. Accordingly, in late June 1941 Florey and Heatley flew to the USA to seek help from firms less restricted by wartime production than those in the UK. The end result of this initiative was that by late 1943 mass production of the drug had begun in America, using a deep-tank fermentation process.<br>
<br>As a result of the work on penicillin Lord Nuffield endowed three research fellowships at Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1948. Heatley was elected to one of these, and Edward Abraham and Gordon Sanders, two other members of the penicillin team, to the others. Heatley's relationship with Lincoln College, which continued almost to the end of his life, was a particularly happy one. After the excitement of penicillin the rest of his career might well have seemed something of an anticlimax, but his skill in introducing new methods and refining and miniaturizing existing ones remained. The results, many of them collaborations with a wide range of scientists, were described in more than sixty scientific papers that he wrote or co-wrote.<br>
<br>In retirement Heatley loved to spend time in his garden and sheds, solving domestic problems and inventing new gadgets. But he was also a quintessential family man. On 18 December 1944 he had married Mercy Irene Bing, a medical student who became a child psychiatrist. She was the daughter of Geoffrey Bing, schoolmaster. They had three sons, one of whom died in a road accident in 1956, and two daughters. Heatley was a proud and immensely involved husband and father, an accomplished house-husband, and an excellent host. His practical brilliance was matched by his down-to-earth, sometimes impish, good humour. He was an excellent raconteur and good company. His home in Marston village was, for more than fifty years, a welcoming haven for generations of students and scientists working in Oxford.<br>
<br>While Fleming received more than 180 honours (honorary degrees, medals, prizes, decorations, freedom of cities, and honorary memberships of scientific societies and academies), Heatley received just one honorary degree&#151;from Oxford in 1990: an honorary doctorate in medicine, only the second given in Oxford's 800-year history and in Heatley's view &#145;an enormous privilege, since I am not medically qualified&#146;  (personal knowledge)&#151;and two honorary fellowships (Lincoln College, Oxford, and St John's College, Cambridge); he was appointed OBE in 1978. Those who knew him readily understood why he became the &#145;unsung hero of penicillin&#146;. He was a most delightful, old-fashioned gentleman; modest to a fault, courteous, kind, considerate, and always looking for ways to help others. He was a team player, rather than a leader of men. Although he may not have received many public honours, he did, however, have in large measure the enormous satisfaction of knowing that he was a key part of the team that gave the world its first practical antibiotic: one that saved the limbs and lives of thousands of allied troops in the Second World War, and subsequently literally millions of patients all round the world.<br>
<br>Heatley died on 5 January 2004 at his home, 12 Oxford Road, Marston, Oxford. He was buried in a biodegradable coffin after a funeral service at St Nicholas's Church, Marston, on 15 January. He was survived by his wife, Mercy, and four children.<br>
