<span class="headword">Stewart <span class="st"> [Stuart]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1470&#150;1544), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the fourth of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26485/', "John Stewart, tenth or first earl of Lennox (d. 1495)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret Montgomerie. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26496/', "Matthew Stewart, eleventh or second earl of Lennox")</script>, was his eldest brother, and he also had four sisters. Robert seems to have gone to France after his father's death in 1495, enrolling in the army in which his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26694/', "B&#233;rault Stuart")</script> (the usual French spelling of his family's name) was a commander. By summer 1498 he was a lieutenant in a force led by his brother William, and in the following year he served in the army with which Louis XII of France invaded Lombardy; he was then continuously involved in the Italian wars which followed. He did distinguished service&#151;in 1500 he assisted in the capture of Ludovico &#145;il Moro&#146; Sforza, duke of Milan&#151;and by April 1508 had command of a body of 100 Scots lances. When his cousin B&eacute;rault died that year he was appointed on 22 August to replace him as captain of Harfleur and Montivilliers in Normandy. Stuart had earlier married B&eacute;rault's daughter Anne (<i>d</i>. 1517) and also inherited his cousin's seigneurie of Aubigny, granted to their ancestor John Stewart of Darnley in 1423. He built the ch&acirc;teau of Aubigny following a fire which destroyed most of the town, and later also converted the ch&acirc;teau of La Verrerie, erected by B&eacute;rault at Oizon some 6 miles away, into a magnificent example of Renaissance architecture, influenced by Fran&ccedil;ois I's building programme in the Loire valley.<br>
<br>On 4 October 1512 Stuart was appointed captain of the king's Scots guards. Although he continued to fight in Italy under such famous generals as Gaston de Foix, duc de Nemours, and Chevalier Bayard, he also performed the ceremonial duties associated with his new position. Thus he was back in Paris for the wedding of Louis XII to Henry VIII's sister Mary Tudor on 9 October 1514, and on 25 January 1515 he attended the coronation of Fran&ccedil;ois I. By this time he had become a marshal of France. Later in 1515 he accompanied the new king to Italy, and he was present at his great victory at Marignano on 13&#150;14 September. Five years later he was one of the French judges at the Field of Cloth of Gold, and then in November he was sent to Scotland by Fran&ccedil;ois as one of two envoys charged with explaining French policy there. On 25 May 1522 he was appointed lieutenant-general of the king's army in Italy, and on 26 October 1523 he was commissioned to bring law and order to the duchy of Burgundy. In the autumn of 1524 Stuart accompanied Fran&ccedil;ois to Italy again. He was captured with him at the battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, but was soon ransomed with help from the French treasury. By 15 June 1527 he had remarried; he and his second wife, Jacqueline de la Queille (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1547/8), who was of an ancient Auvergnat family, received a life grant in survivorship of the comt&eacute; of Beaumont-le-Roger in Normandy. In the same year Stuart took custody of his great-nephews Matthew and John Stewart, the sons of John Stewart, twelfth earl of Lennox, who were sent to France after their father was killed by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart in 1526.<br>
<br>Robert Stuart continued to perform his military and ceremonial duties well into his fifties. Thus he served in Italy again in 1528, was present at the wedding of the future Henri II to Catherine de Medici at Marseilles on 28 October 1533, and in 1536 took part in the king's campaign against the emperor in Provence, accompanied by his great-nephews. But some letters which survive from the 1530s also refer to bouts of ill health, one of which prevented his attending the marriage of James V to Princess Madeleine in Paris on 1 January 1537. No doubt as a result the command of the Scots lances was entrusted to Matthew Stewart, whose incompetence allowed their discipline to collapse, provoking a strongly worded letter of complaint to his great-uncle from the king.<br>
<br>Robert Stuart died at Ch&acirc;teau d'Aubigny in March or April 1544. Expert analysis during 2002 confirmed earlier surmises that three representations of him survive at La Verrerie&#151;a full-length portrait on wood and a medallion, both of about 1525, and a late nineteenth-century copy of an equestrian portrait, now in the ch&acirc;teau courtyard, which was taken from an early sixteenth-century fresco. He is also commemorated in words: according to the memorialist Brant&ocirc;me, Bayard described Stuart as &#145;his great companion and faithful friend&#146;  (Prevost and d'Amat, 4.186).<br>
