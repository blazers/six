<span class="headword">Nehru, Motilal</span>  (1861&#150;1931), <span class="occ">lawyer and Indian nationalist</span>, was born at Agra on 6 May 1861, the posthumous son of Ganga Dhar Nehru, a minor police official in Delhi under the Mughal ruler until the latter was deposed by the British in 1858. Taught Arabic, Persian, and Urdu at home, Nehru studied at the government schools at Allahabad and Cawnpore, and the Muir Central College at Allahabad. He left before graduation and, passing the <i>vakil</i>'s (lawyer's) examination, set up legal practice at Cawnpore in 1883. Three years later he moved to Allahabad, where there was a high court. He had married in 1882, after his first wife died, Swarup Rani Thussu, and had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35191/', "Jawaharlal Nehru")</script>, and two daughters, the elder of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47741/', "Vijayalakshmi Pandit")</script>.<br>
<br>Specializing in various branches of the civil law, Nehru soon became one of the leaders of the Allahabad bar, and lived in lavish style, entertaining a wide circle of friends, British and Indian. He visited England in 1899 and was excommunicated from his Brahman caste for refusing to do penance for travelling overseas. Throughout his life he firmly repudiated caste restrictions. He took a vague interest in politics and from 1888 to 1892 attended the annual sessions of the Indian National Congress. In 1907 he presided over the United Provinces provincial conference and three years later was elected to represent Allahabad in the legislative council of the province.<br>
<br>Nehru at this time believed in constitutional agitation for political reforms. In 1910 he became chairman of the board of directors of <span class="italic">The Leader</span>, a newspaper started in Allahabad to give voice to moderate opinion, and the next year he attended the imperial durbar at Delhi. But in 1917 he was persuaded by Annie Besant to become president of the Home Rule League in Allahabad. He also was drawn to Mahatma Gandhi, who had already won over Jawaharlal Nehru. The son had a strong influence on the father. Nehru was critical of the reforms proposed by the British government in 1918. Disappointed with the attitude of <span class="italic">The Leader</span>, he started his own newspaper, <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, which lasted three years.<br>
<br>In 1919 Nehru served as a member of the committee set up by the Congress to assess the consequences of the action of General Dyer in firing on an unarmed crowd at Amritsar and the imposition of martial law in the Punjab. Later that year he presided over the annual session of the Congress at Amritsar. In 1920 he participated in the campaign of civil disobedience led by Gandhi, and changed his way of life. He handed over his palatial residence to the Congress and built a smaller home for himself, took to wearing <i>khaddar</i> (homespun cotton), abandoned his legal practice, and resigned from the legislative council. In December 1921 he was arrested and sentenced to prison for six months.<br>
<br>Critical of Gandhi for calling off the civil disobedience campaign in February 1922 because of a mob setting fire to a police station, Nehru, on his release from Naini gaol, helped to form the Swaraj (Freedom) Party within the Congress to work for entry into the legislative councils enlarged and reformed in 1919, wherein opposition would embarrass the government. The Congress permitted this deviation from non-co-operation. In 1923 Nehru was elected to the central legislative assembly and became the leader of the opposition. A skilled parliamentarian, he organized the defeat or delay of the finance and other official bills. But Nehru agreed to serve on the committee for considering ways and means of recruiting Indian officers for the army, and this opened the door for others to go further and join the government. So in March 1926 Nehru put forward a &#145;national demand&#146; for the immediate drafting by a representative conference and enactment by parliament of a constitution conferring full dominion status on India. When this was rejected by the assembly Nehru and his colleagues walked out.<br>
<br>This was virtually the end of the Swaraj Party and Nehru returned to the mainstream of the Congress under Gandhi's leadership. He had resumed legal practice in 1926 but supported the boycott of the statutory (Simon) commission into the working of the 1919 reforms. As the constructive side of the boycott, an all-party group was formed with Nehru as chairman to determine the principles of a constitution for India. The Nehru report, published in August 1928, stated that dominion status was the immediate objective, with &#145;full responsible government&#146; transferred to the people of India. Instead of Muslims having separate electorates as enacted in the reforms of 1909 and 1919, whereby they voted for Muslim candidates, there should be reservation of seats for ten years for minorities in provinces, or a common electorate voting for candidates of a certain religion.<br>
<br>In December 1928 Nehru presided over the annual session of the Congress at Calcutta, and it was resolved that if the British government did not accept the Nehru report by the end of 1929 the Congress would revert to the demand for independence and resort once more to a campaign of non-violent non-co-operation. Efforts in 1929 at a compromise proved futile, and in March 1930 Gandhi initiated civil disobedience. Nehru was sentenced in June to imprisonment for six months and joined his son in Naini gaol. Together they were taken in August to see Gandhi in Yeravda gaol in Poona for talks which might lead to a settlement; but these came to nothing. Back in Naini gaol, Nehru was released in September on grounds of ill health. He died of pulmonary emphysema in Lucknow on 6 February 1931.<br>
