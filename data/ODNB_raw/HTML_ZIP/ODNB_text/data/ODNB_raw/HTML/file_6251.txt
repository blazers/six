<span class="headword">Cope, Sir  Anthony</span>, first baronet  (1548<span class="mult">x</span>50&#150;1614), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was probably born at Hardwick Manor, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, the son of Edward Cope (<i>d</i>. 1557), gentleman farmer, and Elizabeth, his wife (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter of Walter Mohun of Overstone and Wollaston, Northamptonshire. He was the second of four sons and three daughters who survived their father's early death. All were then under the joint guardianship of their mother and her father.<br>
<br>Beginning with Cope's grandfather and namesake, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6250/', "Sir Anthony Cope")</script>, the family had been convinced protestants. On Elizabeth Cope's marriage in 1561 to her second husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37261/', "George Carleton")</script>, a new and radical protestant influence affected Anthony. By 1571 he had inherited the family seat of Hanwell, Oxfordshire, from his elder brother, William, and, with business acumen, persuaded his two younger brothers to consider parting with their shares of property in Banbury in return for annuities, when of age. This was an early step in building up substantial property and lands in and around Banbury, and elsewhere in Oxfordshire, besides estates in Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, and Surrey. At an unknown date he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1599/1600), daughter of Rowland Lytton of Knebworth, Hertfordshire, with whom he had four sons and three daughters who survived until adulthood. The marriage of his daughter Elizabeth in 1603 to Richard Cecil, second son of the marquess of Exeter, shows his rise in status; and Cope played host to the earl of Leicester at Hanwell in August 1585.<br>
<br>In 1571 Cope began a parliamentary career which excluded only one parliament up to his death, at first as the MP for Banbury. In it he worked with a group of radical protestants including Peter Wentworth and George Carleton, combining defence of freedom of debate in the Commons (in 1581) with advocacy of further church reform. By 1586 he was deeply committed to presbyterianism, as is attested by his choice of John Dod as rector of Hanwell. Dod was invited to preach, and approved by the people and neighbouring ministers, in Presbyterian fashion, before settling as their minister. He often invited the presbyterian Thomas Cartwright to preach there. Cope was linked to the puritan synod held in early 1587 to further church reform. On 27 February, defying Elizabeth I's ban on parliament's discussing this, he proffered a bill to presbyterianize the Church of England, with a revised Geneva prayer book attached. The queen had both bill and book seized, and on 2 March Cope and other puritan MPs were imprisoned in the Tower of London. This marks the end of his conspicuous parliamentary activity in her reign.<br>
<br>However, Cope's friendships and political alliances were unaffected by his imprisonment. In August 1591 the privy council ordered Hanwell Hall to be searched for material which might have been intended to be moved in parliament, especially over the succession, because Peter Wentworth had been staying there. When the latter hoped for release from a consequent sojourn in the Tower, he named Cope as a friend he would like to dwell with. Cope continued to work locally for &#145;further reformation&#146;. In 1589 he supported prominent Banbury puritans in suppressing May games in the hundred. He presented Robert Cleaver, a radical puritan, to the neighbouring parish of Drayton, and, as Cleaver stayed there after being deprived for non-subscription to the three articles of 1604, may have supported him. Cope resisted recognizing Dod's similar deprivation from Hanwell, so that he also remained in place. Robert Harris, unordained, came as preacher, and eventually succeeded Dod as rector, suggesting he was &#145;called&#146; by the congregation like his predecessor. Cope probably found a niche for Dod with his cousin Sir Edward Cope at Canons Ashby, but ensured him a house in his will should he be driven out of his ministry.<br>
<br>Cope was increasingly involved in county affairs, serving as sheriff three times. He became a JP, and received special commissions from Elizabeth I. He was among those ordered to examine Lady Babington and others who had received the Jesuit Edmund Campion, and to search their homes for Roman Catholic material. In August 1592 he became the gaoler of those influential local recusants imprisoned in Banbury Castle. He guarded them vigilantly, but humanely. In 1596, when many were re-arrested, he economized by charging them board and lodging to pay their guards rather than paying it himself, leading to a prolonged rent strike. He was knighted late in 1592 or early 1593, and henceforth was periodically appointed a deputy lieutenant of Oxfordshire. By 1600 his standing was such that he was one of only seven Oxfordshire gentry selected by the queen to provide one armed horseman each to serve in Ireland, as &#145;of best abilitie [wealth] and of speciall note for their good mind and forwardnes to do her service&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1599&#150;1600</i>, 434&#150;5, 438&#150;9). On the death of his first wife he married, on 7 April 1600, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paston (<i>bap</i>. 1553, <i>d</i>. 1637), widow first of Sir George Chaworth and then of Sir Nicholas Le Strange. His son and heir, William, subsequently married Elizabeth Chaworth, her daughter, thus consolidating both lands and relationships, as Anne had no children with Sir Anthony.<br>
<br>Cope was sufficiently wealthy and influential to entertain James I and Queen Anne for a night at Hanwell Hall in 1605, and the king arranged to return in August 1612. On 29 May 1611 Sir Anthony was created baronet. This meant he had a clear income of &pound;1000 a year, and, according to John Chamberlain, cost &pound;10,000. On Prince Henry's death in 1612 he was one of ten baronets chosen to carry black bannerols around the &#145;chariot&#146; bearing the coffin. Since baronets were created to defend and better Ulster, Sir Anthony was granted 2000 acres at Dirribarde and Killarie, and acquired a further holding in co. Tyrone. A son built houses and a bawn for defence, but the buildings lacked settlers in Sir Anthony's lifetime. On a further 3000 acres at Derrycrevy and Dromullie, in co. Armagh, he had a fine castle built, apparently by English workmen who settled there; and a further &#145;plantation&#146; was soon established. Thus he played an effective part in the protestantization of Ulster. Since he left all his Irish estates to his second son, Anthony, a Cope dynasty settled there.<br>
<br>As knight of the shire from 1604, in the 1606&#150;7 session of James I's parliament Cope resumed campaigning on church matters&#151;for the restoration of ministers deprived for non-subscription, for a preaching ministry, and for the reduction of the powers of the court of high commission. He argued that only legislation should control church practice. He helped draw up a petition to the king on ecclesiastical grievances, and was one of those who presented it. One of his last speeches, in May 1614, was on clerical non-residence, which he denounced with fire:<blockquote>Popery hath hatched up this Monster, which will eat out the very Bowels of the Church &hellip; A Soul-murthering Non-resident is as dangerous to the Soul, as a Murtherer of the Body to it &hellip; If we were upon our sick Bed, we would do otherwise than now.&#151;Not to be satisfied with the Bill; but to petition the King that the Soules of his Subjects might be precious with him: and that the Parliament might not be dissolved till some Course [was] taken about this. (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 482&#150;3)</blockquote>Cope was generally an active and respected MP, sitting on many committees for revising bills, and representing the Commons in learning the Lords' views on the union of England and Scotland in 1607. Then he also joined the senior committee of privileges. His radicalism led him to argue repeatedly that redress of grievances should precede voting of subsidies, as on 9 May 1606, when widespread support for this delayed the presentation of the subsidy bill to the Lords. He vigorously attacked Cowell's <span class="italic">Interpreter</span> on 24 February 1610, darkly suggesting that confederates, perhaps from overseas, were involved. Thus he advocated the rule of law against use of the royal prerogative.<br>
<br>Cope fell ill in June 1614 and died on 6 July, probably at Cope Castle, his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6257/', "Walter Cope's")</script> mansion in Kensington, Middlesex. He was buried at Hanwell, Oxfordshire. The reputed portrait of him at Knole, Sevenoaks, Kent, postdates his death.<br>
