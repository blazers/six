<span class="headword">Fagius,  Paul</span>  (<em>c.</em>1504&#150;1549), <span class="occ">protestant reformer and Hebraist</span>, was born in Rheinzabern in the Rhine Palatinate, son of Peter B&uuml;chelin, schoolmaster and city clerk in Rheinzabern, and Margarethe Hirn of Heidelberg. At the age of eleven he went to the Neckarschule in Heidelberg, where he studied under Johann Brentius and Martin Frechtus. In 1521 he matriculated at the University of Heidelberg and graduated MA the following year. In 1522 he moved to Strasbourg to study Hebrew with Wolfgang Capito. He worked as a schoolmaster in Strasbourg from 1522 until 1527, developing a close friendship with Martin Bucer. In 1527 Fagius (the Latinate form of his German surname B&uuml;chelin) went to the imperial free city of Isny (in the Allgau, near Lake Constance) as director of the Latin school there, a position he held until his return to Strasbourg during 1536&#150;7 to complete his pastoral training for the ministry. From 1538 until 1543 he was the principal minister in Isny, becoming renowned for his preaching and, crucially, for setting up the first Hebrew printing press in Germany. With the patronage of the Isny magistrate Peter Buffler, Fagius was able to bring the celebrated rabbi Elias Levita from Venice, and the two men published more than twenty Hebrew texts. The press in Isny was invaluable to the growing community of protestant Hebrew scholars.<br>
<br>Fagius left Isny in 1543 to take up the position of minister in Constance following the death of Johannes Zwick. But he remained in Constance for less than two years, as Bucer persuaded Fagius in the summer of 1544 to return to Strasbourg to assume both the position of preacher in St Peter's and the chair of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. This proved to be another short stay, for in 1546 he moved to Heidelberg at the invitation of the elector palatine, Friedrich II, to serve as an adviser in the establishment of Lutheranism and in the reform of the university. Fagius, who still held his position in Strasbourg, published several works while in Heidelberg. Following the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League by Charles V in 1547, Fagius, like Bucer, refused to accept the compromise settlement embodied in the following year's Interim, and was dismissed from office in Strasbourg by council in March 1549. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer so esteemed these two men that he risked the anger of Charles V by inviting Bucer and Fagius to England with promises of university posts. The two men arrived at Lambeth Palace in April 1549. Troubles within the English government meant that neither man could be offered positions immediately, and Bucer and Fagius lived in the archbishop's house. William Benson, dean of Westminster, who was a friend of Cranmer, made a generous grant to Fagius and Bucer to support them until posts could be obtained.<br>
<br>Cranmer's plans for the Strasbourg refugees centred on a definitive Latin edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> which would serve as the basis for a new English translation. Fagius was clearly daunted by the task, and the young Edward VI was enlisted to persuade the two scholars to take up this project. Fagius's correspondence from England reflected his concern that the Edwardian Reformation was proceeding too cautiously, and he was outraged by the misuse of church property following the death of Henry VIII. But his contribution to the English Reformation was brief, as he fell ill from plague in the autumn of 1549. He moved to Cambridge in November, having been appointed reader in Hebrew, but he died on 13 November in the arms of Martin Bucer. He was buried in St Michael's Church in Cambridge, but his remains were exhumed during Mary's reign and publicly burnt, a posthumous humiliation likewise inflicted upon Bucer. His honours were restored publicly in July 1560, following Elizabeth's accession. Like Bucer, Fagius was moderate in his theological positions; he was more concerned with scholarship and pastoral care than with doctrinal distinctions. His early death shocked and saddened the protestant world, in which he was regarded as an outstanding Hebrew scholar.<br>
