<span class="headword">Long <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hume]</span>,  Amelia</span>, Lady Farnborough  (1772&#150;1837), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 29 January 1772, the elder daughter of the prominent art collector <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14131/', "Sir Abraham Hume (1749&#150;1838)")</script> and his wife, Amelia Egerton (1751&#150;1809). She was educated in the classics. On 28 May 1793 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16962/', "Charles Long (1760&#150;1838)")</script>, a Treasury official who later became paymaster-general and in 1826 Baron Farnborough. He not only shared his wife's interests in the arts, but also took on the role of unofficial art adviser to the prince of Wales (later George IV). He drew and etched to a small extent and formed, no doubt with his wife's approval, a modest but significant art collection which included neo-classical sculpture, Dutch and Flemish paintings, and landscapes by Gainsborough, Claude, Rubens, Gaspard Dughet, and Sir George Beaumont.<br>
<br>Early in their marriage, the Longs acquired property and land in Bromley, Kent, where they finally settled in 1801. Situated on a hill and built in the Italian style, Bromley Hill Place was transformed into 130 acres of spacious lawn, wooded grounds, winding waterways and rock garden, with rustic bridges and seats &#145;for rest and contemplation&#146;, a summer house, farm buildings, carefully sited marble vases, and sun dial  (Long to George Cumberland, Egerton, 384). The house subsequently became a meeting place for artists and royalty, as well as the arena for Amelia Long's works as a horticulturist and watercolourist.<br>
<br>In or shortly after 1796 Amelia Long took drawing lessons from the landscape painter Thomas Girtin, who reputedly &#145;told everything to his favourite pupil Lady Long&#146;  (Roget, 91). Early work shows her copying the masters of landscape painting, and employing the wide-angled topographical format and restricted tonal colour scheme characteristic of Girtin's work: a typical example is the <span class="italic">View of St Paul's from Thames</span> (National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh). At the same time she was brought into contact with Dr Thomas Monro, the patron of aspiring watercolour painters and himself an amateur artist. Charles Long subscribed to the upkeep of J. R. Cozens, who was under Monro's care, and it may have been through the Monro Academy that Amelia Long was first introduced to Girtin.<br>
<br>Amelia Long's relationship with the portrait painter Henry Edridge (1769&#150;1821) was even closer. Another member of the Monro circle, he was an important influence on her studies of natural foliage and vegetation, which were mainly executed in pencil or chalk, sometimes with charcoal. His style is also apparent in a series of picturesque continental townscapes in soft ground etching, the result of three visits to France and Holland between 1815 and 1819 (British Museum, London). During her earliest visit, at the height of the Napoleonic war, Amelia Long also painted the British troops at St Cloud (Fairhaven collection, Anglesey. Surviving sketchbooks&#151;in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and in Perth Museum and Art Gallery&#151;show that Long otherwise confined her travels to the south of England. The limited number of oil paintings which she appears to have executed are serene, somewhat Italianate landscapes: contemporaries commented on their Corotesque and Wilsonic qualities. Watercolour, however, remained her favourite medium and Bromley Hill Place the subject depicted more than any other, as is evidenced by her <span class="italic">Views of Bromley Hill</span>, twelve soft ground etchings, now held in the British Museum, London. As a mark of the respect which she commanded among fellow artists, she was made an honorary exhibitor at the Royal Academy from 1807 to 1822 and at the British Institution in 1825. Lady Farnborough died at Bromley Hill Place on 15 January 1837, and was buried at St Lawrence's Church, Wormley, Hertfordshire. She is now recognized as one of the talented group of amateur women watercolourists who made a vital contribution to early English watercolour painting.<br>
