<span class="headword">Beaver, Sir  Hugh Eyre Campbell</span>  (1890&#150;1967), <span class="occ">brewer and civil engineer</span>, was born in Johannesburg on 4 May 1890, the eldest of three sons of Hugh Edward Campbell Beaver, landowner of Montgomeryshire, and his wife, Cerise, daughter of John Eyre, who was of Anglo-Irish extraction. Beaver's father died when he was two years old and the family returned to England to settle in Penn Street, Buckinghamshire. In 1904 he won a scholarship to Wellington College, Berkshire. During his final year in 1910 he was head boy and was awarded the king's medal. Beaver tried unsuccessfully for an open scholarship to Oxford, but took first place in the examination for entry to the Indian police. From 1910 to 1922 he served with the Indian police, where he was engaged mainly in administrative and intelligence work.<br>
<br>Beaver returned to England in 1922, where he met his mother's neighbour, Sir Alexander Gibb, a well-known contractor and engineer then in the process of setting up a new type of consulting engineering practice to cater for the needs of modern factory production. Beaver joined the firm as Gibb's personal assistant, rapidly gaining experience in a wide range of industrial projects. In 1931 he undertook a national survey of Canadian ports and, in addition, the rebuilding in five months of the port of Saint John, New Brunswick, following its destruction by fire. Beaver's report on the Canadian ports was published in 1932 and subsequently implemented. He became company secretary in 1931 and, a year later, a partner of Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners. During the 1930s, two further commissions were of particular note. First, Beaver was responsible for the design and construction of the new Guinness brewery at Park Royal, London, between 1932 and 1936. He impressed the company with his far-sighted decision to acquire additional land for future development and was invited by the managing director, C. J. Newbold, to join the Guinness board. On this occasion the offer was refused. Second, he produced a series of reports for the special areas commission, which provided the basis of the government's relief programme for the distressed areas of the north-east and south Wales. Beaver married in 1925 his second cousin, Jean Atwood, daughter of Major Robert Atwood Beaver MD; they had two daughters before her early death in 1933.<br>
<br>With the approach of war, Beaver was asked by the government to design and commission three ordnance factories. In 1940 he was appointed director-general of the Ministry of Works, where he remained for the duration of the war. In this key position, Beaver was responsible for the planning and execution of the entire wartime programme of construction, and for the supply of building materials. In 1940 he was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers under an &#145;eminence clause&#146;, and in 1943 was knighted for his services.<br>
<br>Immediately after the war, Beaver was invited by Lord Iveagh to join Guinness as assistant managing director. He took over as managing director in 1946 after the sudden death of Newbold. His specific task was to modernize the company, and over the next five years he introduced modern management methods and a policy of diversification, inspired more effective research, saw through a notable growth of exports, and encouraged the development of young managers. Beaver remained at Guinness until his retirement in 1960, during this time demonstrating his outstanding ability as an administrator and manager. He was responsible for its major reorganization into two separate trading companies, Guinness Ireland and Guinness UK. He introduced Harp lager into Ireland, and subsequently into Britain: it rapidly became the leading brand of lager. He also initiated the <span class="italic">Guinness Book of Records</span>. Beaver took a central role in the brewers' post-war campaign to prevent state purchase of the licensed trade and was prospective chairman of the Brewers' Society in 1959, when ill health forced him to withdraw. He became a vice-president of the society the following year.<br>
<br>After the war Beaver resumed his public service with his appointment to the new towns committee chaired by Lord Reith, and to Stafford Cripps's working party on the building industry. In 1951 he became chairman of the British Institute of Management and deputy chairman of the Colonial Development Corporation. The following year he was chairman of the committee on power stations and in 1953 chaired the committee on air pollution (known as the Beaver committee), whose recommendations were embodied in the 1956 <span class="roman">Clean Air Act</span>. In 1954&#150;6 Beaver was also chairman of the advisory council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. He was made a KBE in 1956 for his services to the nation.<br>
<br>Beaver had an unflagging capacity for work. He was an extremely effective chairman and had a great ability to absorb and understand new problems. This was particularly evident during his presidency of the Federation of British Industries between 1957 and 1959. He conducted with great skill the critical council meetings at which the position of British industry to the treaty of Rome was determined. The same was true of the talks in Paris, Stockholm, and London which preceded the formation of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). He was also chairman of the Industrial Fund for the Advancement of Scientific Education in Schools and of Ashridge College, president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers and of the Royal Statistical Society. In 1956 he joined the council of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and served as chairman from 1957 until 1966. A governor of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, he continued as its honorary treasurer until 1966. He received honorary degrees from Cambridge University, Trinity College, Dublin, and the National University of Ireland.<br>
<br>Although poor health caused him to retire from full-time work in 1960, Beaver remained a keen amateur archaeologist and a fine shot. He was also able to devote more time to his garden and his picture collection. He continued his public work, however, often in an unofficial capacity. He undertook the treasurership of the University of Sussex and the chairmanship of the British Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled. His active role at the Federation of British Industries continued long after his presidency, and in the early 1960s he played a leading part in the formation of the National Economic Development Council. Beaver died at his home, Luxford, Crowborough, Sussex, on 16 January 1967.<br>
