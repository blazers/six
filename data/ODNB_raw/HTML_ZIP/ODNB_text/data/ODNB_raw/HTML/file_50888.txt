<span class="headword">Imray,  James</span>  (1803&#150;1870), <span class="occ">hydrographer and stationer</span>, was born on 16 May 1803 in Spitalfields, London, the third child and eldest son of the six children of James Imray (1761/2&#150;1830), a Scottish dyer, and his wife, Elizabeth Cooper (1779/80&#150;1842). In 1818, shortly before his fifteenth birthday, Imray was apprenticed to William Lukyn, a stationer, of George Street, Mansion House. Six years later, on 16 May 1824, he married Elizabeth Cutbill (1805&#150;1836), the daughter of another Spitalfields silk family, and when their first child, Elisabeth Ann, was baptized in 1825 James described himself as a bookseller. In 1827 and 1828 he was trading briefly on his own account as a bookbinder specializing in account books, first in Cheapside and then at 116 Minories, the premises of the chart publisher Robert Blachford. There is no further record of his trading until 1835 when he opened in Budge Row, just west of Cannon Street, again specializing in account books. In 1836 he was also trading as a dealer in marine stores in Patriot Row, Bethnal Green; that year, on 24 October, Elizabeth died of consumption leaving him with three young children, but before the year was out he had returned to the Minories to join Michael Blachford as a partner in the Blachford chart publishing business.<br>
<br>Blachford and Imray traded together for ten years and brought a new vitality to the business, which had been lagging sadly behind its rivals; they enlarged and updated the chart list, published new sailing directions, and opened a nautical academy. During these years Imray was still involved in stationery, with a share in the Budge Row account book business, having taken in a partner, William Fitch, and an interest in another unsuccessful stationery venture. In 1846 Imray sold out to Fitch and committed himself to a future in chart publishing, acquiring Michael Blachford's share of the chart business and becoming sole proprietor. A period of rapid growth followed and in 1850 he moved to larger premises at 102 Minories. Imray's own particular interest was in chart compilation and he expanded his list beyond home trade waters with new charts of American and eastern seas. The publication of sailing directions, the manufacture and sale of nautical instruments (with which the firm had widened its services to navigators), and the nautical academy all flourished. In 1854, when his elder son, James Frederick Imray (1829&#150;1891), became a partner in the book and instrument sides of the business, the firm became James Imray &amp; Son.<br>
<br>By the 1860s Imray had become the leading British commercial chart publisher and was operating from three premises: 89 Minories housed chart publication, 102 Minories chart and books sales and the nautical academy, and 1 Postern Row the instrument shop. The majority of the fast-growing British merchant fleet used his charts because, although accurate Admiralty charts were now available, merchant shipmasters still preferred the charts of commercial publishers, named &#145;blue backs&#146; from their distinctive blue paper backing, and particularly James Imray's blue backs. They were popular because they retained the traditional format of a small-scale general chart with many large-scale insets of harbours. They were designed to answer the needs of a particular voyage conveniently and used modern survey material, now available from Admiralty and foreign government charts. They were more expensive than Admiralty charts, but fewer of them were needed because for some voyages they provided all that was required on a single chart; they were also accompanied by complementary sailing directions.<br>
<br>As official surveys of Australia, New Zealand, the north-west coast of America, and the coast of Chile became available, Imray used them to compile charts designed for wool clippers, gold rush ships, and copper and nitrate clippers. As the influence of the East India Company waned and eastern seas opened to all British ships he published new charts of the Indian and Pacific oceans, followed by popular series of larger scale charts for the intricate passages through the eastern archipelago and on to China. Charts for particular trades were promoted with labels such as &#145;Rice ports of India&#146; and &#145;Cotton ports of Georgia&#146;. Before he died his catalogue listed over 150 charts. He also led the defence of the private publishers against increasing Admiralty competition and in 1865 acquired the <span class="italic">Mercantile Marine Magazine</span>, the mouthpiece of the private publishers, edited by his navigation teacher W. H. Rosser.<br>
<br>Imray's success was founded on shrewd business skills and an appreciation of his customers' needs. Although he expanded the firm's other activities his heart was in chart publishing and he always kept personal control of this. He was the leading private chart publisher of the day, standing head and shoulders above his competitors. His name was virtually synonymous with the term &#145;blue back&#146;: Thomas Gray, of the marine department of the Board of Trade, wrote in 1875 that &#145;I only know of Imray's charts (i.e. the blue backs) as running the Admiralty charts close&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorandum relating to the Supply and Correction of Charts</span>, Board of Trade departmental paper, no. 79, 1882).<br>
<br>In his later years Imray and his second wife, Ann Hilton (1809&#150;1892), whom he married on 4 January 1838, lived in Manor Park, Streatham, where his granddaughter remembered him in old age as a red-haired, very stockily built, florid faced man who was fond of children. He died there on 15 November 1870 at the age of sixty-seven after a long illness; the cause of death was given as cardiac dropsy.<br>
<br>James Frederick Imray inherited the business on his father's death. Although he also drew charts, his principal contribution was authorship of many of the firm's sailing directions. His <span class="italic">North Pacific Pilot, Part I</span> (1870) was considered the best available and supplied by the Admiralty for use in warships. However, James Frederick lived the comfortable life of a second generation proprietor and lacked his father's business acumen. In the face of increasing Admiralty competition, the firm began to decline slowly and after his death his inexperienced young sons had to agree to amalgamation with their competitors Norie and Wilson in 1899. Five years later they were joined by the only other surviving private chart publisher, R. H. Laurie.<br>
<br>The amalgamated firm, Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson Ltd, under the leadership of the Wilson family, carried the tradition of British private chart publishing on through the twentieth century. They survived the near monopoly of government charting, finding a role in meeting the needs of specialist users such as fishermen and yachtsmen. They are still publishing charts today.<br>
