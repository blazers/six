<span class="headword">Blackwell,  John</span>  (1624&#150;1701), <span class="occ">government official and colonial governor</span>, was born in St Matthew's parish, London, on 8 March 1624, the eldest son and second of ten children of John Blackwell (1594/5&#150;1658), a puritan-inclined London merchant who at one time supplied the royal household with groceries and who latterly settled in Mortlake in Surrey, and his first wife, Juliana (<i>d</i>. 1640). Blackwell was an ensign in the City of London's horse militia as early as 1642 and a cornet in the parliamentary army by 1644; in 1645 he became a captain in Oliver Cromwell's own cavalry regiment, in which he served until June 1648. On 9 June 1647 Blackwell married Elizabeth Smithesby (<i>d</i>. 1669), a relative of his father's second wife, Martha Smithesby. They had at least eight children.<br>
<br>From 1645 Blackwell combined his military service with the important post of deputy treasurer-at-wars. As he was a political as well as a religious Independent, his appointment may have been intended to reassure the army, since the war treasurers themselves were London aldermen of Presbyterian persuasion. In 1649 the Rump Parliament rejected a motion to make Blackwell a full treasurer, but in 1652 he became co-treasurer with an obscure back-bench MP, and from 1653 with Richard Deane; they were also joint receivers-general of assessments, and thus responsible for the entire system of direct taxation and military expenditure. Blackwell and Deane received a basic salary plus poundage according to the level of military spending. Although Charles Fleetwood, the lord deputy, grumbled about his getting priority for his Irish land claims&#151;Blackwell and his father both having invested in Ireland as adventurers, and part of his own pay arrears being due in this way&#151;two years later John Thurloe, secretary of state, thought his conduct perfectly reasonable. In the 1656&#150;8 parliament, as a member for Surrey Blackwell was active in committees but took little part in the debates.<br>
<br>Although Blackwell might have seemed to be a committed Cromwellian, he like Deane supported the Wallingford House faction, led by Charles Fleetwood and John Lambert, who were responsible for the overthrow of Richard Cromwell as protector and for the return of the Rump in May 1659. If a little less politically active than his colleague Deane, Blackwell too continued to act under the military junta of October&#150;December; and not surprisingly the restored Long Parliament replaced both of them as war treasurers early in 1660. After the Restoration he was one of those perpetually disabled from holding any office. He was able to satisfy royalist investigators that an out-payment which he had made in connection with the king's trial and execution had simply been a routine matter, in no way implicating him in the actual regicide. This was fortunate, since his father had served on the second high court of justice in February&#150;March 1649, which had tried and condemned James Hamilton, first duke of Hamilton, Henry Rich, first earl of Holland, and other royalist leaders in the second civil war of 1648. The elder Blackwell's religious commitment was at least as strong as his son's; he seems to have died in some poverty in early 1658, having previously calculated the debts owing to himself at nearly &pound;36,000.<br>
<br>Blackwell's Irish lands had been confirmed by a special act in the second protectorate parliament of 1656&#150;8. In the autumn of 1659, when he was appointed (very briefly as it turned out) to be a treasury commissioner, he was also elected an alderman of the City of London; early the next year he was excused from this dignity owing to lack of means. At the Restoration his former church and crown lands and those belonging to the Butler (Ormond) family in Ireland were all forfeit, but he managed to retain other Irish interests through the friendship and protection of the first Baron Kingston who, as Sir John King, had been a Cromwellian until 1659. In spite of this Blackwell was threatened with arrest at least once in the 1660s. He seems to have divided his time between Dublin and Chester.<br>
<br>About 1672, having been a widower for some two years, Blackwell married Frances, daughter of the imprisoned republican general, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15939/', "John Lambert")</script>, which hardly argues any diminution in his commitment to the Good Old Cause. They had nine children, one of whom, Lambert Blackwell, became a household official and diplomatic envoy under William III, was knighted, and then made a baronet in 1718: a nice reminder of the continuities between the protectorate and the post-1689 monarchy.<br>
<br>The next phase of Blackwell's career was in the colony of Massachusetts Bay, where he arrived in 1684. In spite of the charter having been called in and the old puritan ruling party apparently crushed, Blackwell rapidly attained considerable influence, as was sourly noted by the ardently imperialistic customs official Edward Randolph. Blackwell produced an ingenious if not wholly convincing scheme for a land bank, to provide credit and to help overcome the colony's chronic shortage of specie. It is not clear whether the plan foundered because of legal or constitutional doubts about the governor's interim council lacking authority to incorporate such a bank, or because of opposition from the mercantile, creditor interest. Blackwell had already been in touch with William Penn when the Quaker proprietor offered him the deputy governorship of the infant colony of Pennsylvania, in a desperate attempt to reassert his authority over the resident Quaker oligarchy based in Philadelphia. Blackwell's effective period as governor lasted only a year, from the end of 1688 to new year 1690, and is generally reckoned a failure. Given the balance of social and political forces and the lack of coercive power, Pennsylvania was in fact ungovernable except by, or with the tacit agreement of, the local &eacute;lite. The governor expressed his disillusionment in letters to Penn and others: &#145;the hosts of Musqueetos are worse than armed men: yet the men without Armes worse than they&#146;; he also attacked what he saw as Quaker hypocrisy: &#145;each praying with his neighbour on First Days, and then preying on him the other six&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Having declined Penn's offer of a lesser post as receiver-general of all proprietary revenues in the colony, Blackwell returned to Massachusetts in 1690 and then to England in 1693 or 1694. Thereafter he lived in Bethnal Green in east London; he died intestate, and was buried in Kensington on 6 July 1701. The baronetcy bestowed on his son became extinct in 1801.<br>
