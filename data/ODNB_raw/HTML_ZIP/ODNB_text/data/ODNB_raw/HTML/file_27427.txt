<span class="headword">Babington,  Anthony</span>  (1561&#150;1586), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was born in October 1561 at Dethick, Derbyshire, the third child and eldest son of Henry Babington of Dethick and his second wife, Mary, daughter of George, Lord Darcy, and granddaughter of Thomas, Lord Darcy, who was beheaded for his role in the Pilgrimage of Grace. The family had been established in Derbyshire since the fifteenth century and had considerable property there and in adjoining counties. Henry Babington, who was said to be &#145;inclined to papistrie&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), died in 1571, leaving Anthony as his heir under the guardianship of his mother, her second husband, Henry Foljambe, and Philip Draycot of Paynsley, Staffordshire, his future father-in-law. They were all probably inclined towards Catholicism. About 1579 Babington married Draycot's daughter Margery, and he appears to have spent some time at Lincoln's Inn the following year.<br>
<br>Babington won his place in history by his leadership of a Catholic conspiracy in 1586 to assassinate Queen Elizabeth and free Mary Stewart from imprisonment. This would, the conspirators hoped, be followed by an invasion by the forces of Philip II and the Catholic league in France, leading to the restoration of the Catholic religion. It was the first Catholic plot in which the murder of the queen was an integral part from the beginning. Babington's connection with Mary had begun about 1579 when he had served as a page in the household of the earl of Shrewsbury at Sheffield, where the earl had charge of the Scottish queen. In 1580 he had gone to Paris, where he met Thomas Morgan, one of the leaders of the Catholic secular clergy, and James Beaton, archbishop of Glasgow, Mary's ambassador to France. The suggestion put forward in older works, including the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, that Babington joined a secret society of young men for the protection of Jesuit missionaries is not true: there was no such society. A few years later, probably in 1583&#150;4 when he was back in England, he did carry some letters to Mary from Morgan but then, according to his own confession, dropped out of the business. This gave him, however, a contact with Mary which later proved fatal to them both.<h2>
<a name="Theplotters"></a>The plotters</h2>In or about May 1586 Babington was visited by one of the key figures in the conspiracy, the Catholic priest <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1236/', "John Ballard (d. 1586)")</script>, who had been in England since 1581. Ballard made a brief trip to Rome in 1584 in the company of Antony Tyrell, who was hatching his own plot against Elizabeth. Not long before visiting Babington, Ballard had been in touch with the Spanish ambassador in Paris, Bernardino de Mendoza, and had told him of a plot being raised in England to kill the queen and overthrow the protestant religion. He now informed Babington that the leaders of the Catholic league in France, the dukes of Guise and Mayenne, wished to take revenge upon Queen Elizabeth and had been appointed by the pope to lead an invasion force into England. Babington was at first sceptical: he objected that nothing could be done while Elizabeth was alive, that there was little support in England for an invasion, and that the French Catholic princes were unlikely to come.<br>
<br>To the first point Ballard replied that Elizabeth would be taken care of by another conspirator, <a name="cosubject_24717"></a><span class="headword">John Savage</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1586)<span class="occ"></span>. This man had served with Parma's army in the Netherlands. Returning home via Rheims, he had met Ballard and William Gifford, a leading secular priest, who entangled him in a plot to murder the queen. He was then brought into touch with Babington, who had by then acquired a small group of fellow plotters, all of them, according to the memoirs of the Jesuit William Weston, &#145;young men of his own rank, zealous and adventurous catholics, bold in danger, earnest for the protection of the catholic faith, or for any enterprise intended to promote the catholic cause&#146;  (Pollen, cvi). All were known to the government.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24543/', "Thomas Salisbury, or Salesbury (1561x4&#150;1586)")</script>, came from the important landed family of Salisbury of Lleweni, Denbighshire. His father had died when he was very young and he was brought up with his grandfather at Lleweni. On his grandfather's death in 1578 Thomas became the head of the family and ward of the earl of Leicester. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, in 1580, where he seems to have moved in Catholic circles. He and Babington were said to have been &#145;bedfellows for a quarter of a year or more&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1581&#150;90</i>, 346). <a name="cosubject_11831"></a><span class="headword">Edward Abington</span>  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1586)<span class="occ"></span> was the eldest son of John Abington, or Habington, of Hindlip, Worcestershire, and Catherine, daughter of John Wykes. John Abington was under-treasurer or cofferer to Queen Elizabeth. Edward was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, and took his BA in 1574. <a name="cosubject_27427"></a><span class="headword">Chidiock Tichborne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1558&#150;1586)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Southampton, the son of Peter Tichborne and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Middleton. Like his father he was a known Catholic and was interrogated in 1583 about some &#145;popish relics&#146; that he had brought back from abroad, where he had gone without leave; and in June 1586 accusations about &#145;popish practices&#146; were laid against his family. <a name="cosubject_27450"></a><span class="headword">Charles Tilney</span>  (1561&#150;1586)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 23 September 1561, the son of Philip Tilney of Shelley Hall, Suffolk, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Francis Framlingham of Crowshall, Debenham, Suffolk. His paternal grandfather, Frederick Tilney (<i>d</i>. 1541) was a first cousin to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27451/', "Edmund Tilney")</script>, master of the revels. Charles became a gentleman pensioner at court.<br>
<br>Two others, about whom little is known, were among this group of conspirators which met in London on 7 June 1586. Edward Windsor was the younger brother of Lord Windsor. He soon disappeared from the meetings of the plotters and was not present at the final trial. Robert Barnewell probably belonged to the prominent Irish pale family of that name. He used to attend court as a servant to the earl of Kildare and was apparently known by sight to Queen Elizabeth. One of Walsingham's agents left a brief physical description of him as tall, &#145;comely&#146;, white-faced, flaxen bearded, freckled, and disfigured with smallpox.<br>
<br>Five others joined the plot a little later. Edward Jones of Plas Cadwgan, Denbighshire, was the son of another Edward, tailor to Queen Mary, master of the wardrobe to Queen Elizabeth, and sheriff of Denbighshire in 1576. The father was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the earl of Leicester, to whom he recommended his son. Unhappily, the son turned to Catholicism under the influence of Thomas Salisbury, who involved him in the plot. They were deputed to set off a rising in north Wales. Henry Donne was a Londoner and a clerk of the first fruits office; he was probably an older relative of John Donne, the poet. Robert Gage came from Surrey, John Travers and John Charnock were both from Lancashire families; otherwise nothing is known of them. Sir Thomas Gerard, suspected by the government of involvement, was probably the Thomas Gerard of Bryn, Lancashire, MP for Lancashire in 1563. He was a known Catholic, the father of John Gerard, the Jesuit, and had been imprisoned in 1571 for plotting to free Mary Stewart. In 1586 his involvement was marginal and he escaped the main trial. He was, however, imprisoned in the Tower once again. Except for Savage, all those plotters about whom anything is known had links to the royal court. This was not a provincial conspiracy, but rather one hatched in London, mainly by young Catholic courtiers.<br>
<br>One man with a different background was deeply involved in the conspiracy. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10660/', "Gilbert Gifford (1560&#150;1590)")</script> was thought by Ballard, Babington, and the others to be one of themselves, but was in fact in the pay of the government. The son of a recusant family seated at Chillington, Staffordshire, Gifford had entered Douai College, by then at Rheims, in 1577 and transferred to the English College at Rome two years later. Here he seems to have made contact with one of Walsingham's agents. Whether for this or for some other reason, he was expelled from the English College. After a brief stay at Rheims, he went to Paris. By then he was probably in Walsingham's service. In December 1585 he returned to England with a letter of recommendation to Mary from her agent in Paris, Thomas Morgan. He was arrested on landing and taken to Walsingham, who employed him in carrying letters to and from Mary, then closely guarded by Sir Amias Paulet (or Poulet) at Chartley, without her knowing that all her correspondence was tampered with by the government. Walsingham's agents suborned a brewer from Burton upon Trent, known to Paulet and others as &#145;the honest man&#146;, who brought a regular supply of beer to Mary's household. The brewer placed letters to and from Mary in a small leather package inside the bunghole of the barrels as he delivered and collected them in the course of his business. Incoming and outgoing letters were received by Gifford and passed to Walsingham's cryptographer, Thomas Phelippes, for decoding. The originals were then resealed and sent to their intended recipients, while copies went to Walsingham. The government was thus kept fully informed of the entire progress of the plot, usually before the conspirators themselves.<h2>
<a name="Themakingoftheplot"></a>The making of the plot</h2>Babington seems to have become the leader of the conspirators, perhaps <i>faute de mieux</i>. Weston described him as &#145;attractive in face and form, quick of intelligence, agreeable and facetious; he had a turn for literature unusual in men of the world&#146;  (Pollen, cvi). Perhaps he was not really a man of the world: he was certainly no leader. After their meeting on 7 June 1586 the conspirators settled down to discuss their position. Babington told them that:<blockquote>we seemed to stand in a dilemma &hellip; On the one side lest by a massacre &hellip; the magistrates here would take awaye our lives &hellip; and on the other side lest the straunger shoulde invade and sacke our countrye, and bring it into servitude to foreigners. (ibid., 54)</blockquote>He concluded that it would be best for them all to leave the realm and asked Robert Poley, whom he thought to be an accomplice but was actually in Walsingham's service, to get him a passport. Through Poley, Babington secured three interviews with Walsingham, who kept him waiting for his passport and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him to give up his enterprise and to reveal the names of his associates. Babington also had conversations with Poley in which he expressed his desire for the contemplative life. By the end of June a great deal of talking had been done&#151;&#145;thus we discoursed&#146;, recalled Babington in his confession  (ibid., 55)&#151;but active steps to raise support and set down plans were dragging. Extraordinarily, Babington spent some of the time arranging for the conspirators to have their portraits drawn. These have not survived, though they were at some stage shown to the queen, so that she might recognize them if any of the conspirators appeared at court.<br>
<br>Early in July Babington returned to London from the country and once more met Ballard, who urged action upon him. The other conspirators &#145;still cryed out of my delaye&#146;, he recalled in his confession  (Pollen, 60); but now he acted. On 6 July he wrote a coded letter to Mary pledging his devotion to her cause. He had earlier, he said, despaired of the situation of the Catholics in England and had resolved to leave the country and live in solitude. But, he wrote, &#145;one Ballard, a man of vertue and learning&#146;, had come to him and told him of the preparations being made overseas by Christian princes to deliver England from its miserable state. He vowed &#145;either to prevaile in the churches behalf and your majesties, or fortunately to die for that honorable cause&#146;  (Pollen, 20). He himself with ten gentlemen and one hundred followers would deliver Mary from imprisonment. &#145;For the dispatch of the usurper [Elizabeth]&#146; there were six gentlemen, &#145;all my private friends&#146;, who will undertake &#145;that tragical execution&#146;  (Pollen, 22). It was necessary to assure them that they or their posterity would be rewarded.<br>
<br>On 17 July Mary fatally replied. She expressed gratitude for Babington's letter and asked him to write frequently, commending his desire to frustrate the designs of &#145;our enemies&#146;. She stressed that if remedy were not provided soon it would be too late. She followed this general exhortation with a practical and sensible agenda for preparing rebellion. They must assess what forces they could raise; what towns and ports could be assured; what foreign forces they required and the means of paying them; what place of assembly should be appointed; what provision should be made of horses and armour. They must decide &#145;by what means do the six gentlemen deliberate to proceed&#146; and the manner of &#145;my getting forth out of this hold&#146;. They should give out to potential followers that these preparations were defensive, &#145;against the puritans of this realme&#146; and against an attempt by Leicester's forces in the Netherlands to return and &#145;usurp the crown&#146;. These statements would, she said, serve as a pretext for assembly &#145;without touching the crown&#146;. Then &#145;set the six gentlemen to work&#146;, ensuring that as soon as they have accomplished their design&#151;the murder of Elizabeth&#151;Mary herself should be rescued. All must be ready before they acted. She proposed three possible means of rescue and concluded with the injunction: &#145;fail not to burn this present quickly&#146;. She did not, of course, know that her letter would be read by Walsingham before Babington even received it. There was a postscript: &#145;I will be glad to know the names and qualities of the six gentlemen, which are to accomplish the designment [the murder of the queen]&#146;  (Pollen, 38&#150;46). This was almost certainly added by Walsingham's agent Phelippes, with the object of luring Babington into giving away the names of the principal plotters. The stratagem failed, but Walsingham already had enough evidence on which to condemn Mary.<h2>
<a name="Arrestandtrial"></a>Arrest and trial</h2>On 2 August 1586, three days after Babington received Mary's letter, Phelippes asked Walsingham &#145;whether Babington is to be apprehended, or otherwise played with&#146;  (Pollen, cl). Walsingham evidently opted to give him a little more rope, in the hope of uncovering more details of the plot. He decided, however, to deal at once with Ballard, who was arrested two days later. Babington claimed in his confession that only then did he decide to put into effect the plan for assassinating the queen. He told Savage to go at once to court and kill the queen. Savage replied: &#145;I cannot go tomorrow for my apparel is not ready, and in this apparel shall I never come near the Queen&#146;  (Hargrave, 1.129). Babington gave him his ring and money for clothes and told him to act. Babington himself then went out to dinner with one of Walsingham's undercover agents, a man called Scudamore. Realizing in the course of the meal that Scudamore had received an order for his arrest, Babington went to the bar to pay the bill and fled, for once showing power of decision. He hid with some companions in St John's Wood, his face smeared with green walnut shells, and was eventually caught at the house of the Bellamy family in Harrow. The government of the city put on a show of public loyalty, witnessing &#145;her public joy by ringing of bells, making of bonfires, and singing of psalms&#146;  (Camden, 303).<br>
<br>All the conspirators were rigorously interrogated and each of them confessed fully, seemingly without the pains of torture, except perhaps in the case of Ballard. By the middle of September the crown had all the evidence it needed from their confessions. Seven defendants were arraigned before the judges on 13 and 14 September. Savage was dealt with first, since he had become involved separately from the others. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy, not guilty to assenting to kill the queen. However, since his confession stated clearly that he had sworn an oath to assassinate her, this plea could hardly be sustained and he changed it to guilty. Ballard, Babington, Barnewell, Donne, Salisbury, and Tichborne then all pleaded guilty to conspiring to free Mary and alter religion, not guilty to planning to kill the queen, Babington laying &#145;all the blame upon Ballard, for bringing him to his destruction&#146;  (Hargrave, 1.131). Told that they could not plead in different ways to separate charges, all except Tichborne changed their pleas to guilty. Tichborne claimed that he had intended to desert the conspirators and ride down to Hampshire, but had been prevented by lameness. He, too, then changed his plea. Counsel for the queen set out the evidence, in which the conspirators implicated one another in their confessions, and all were condemned to die traitors' deaths.<br>
<br>On 15 September the remaining seven were arraigned: Abington and Tilney of the original conspirators, and Jerome Bellamy, Charnock, Jones, Gage, and Travers of those who became involved later. All pleaded not guilty, Abington invoking the rule demanding two prosecution witnesses in treason trials. Their pleas were to no effect and all were predictably found guilty. Given the opportunity to speak for themselves, Bellamy, charged with harbouring Babington in Harrow, &#145;spoke very little for himself, only he seemed to be a very clownish, blunt, wilful and obstinate papist&#146;; Abington said it was all the fault of Babington, &#145;that brainless youth&#146;; Tilney and Jones begged that their debts be paid, Jones also asking that &#145;some consideration may be had of my posterity&#146;  (Hargrave, 1.140).<h2>
<a name="Execution"></a>Execution</h2>Gallows were set up a week later near St Giles-in-the-Fields, where the plots had been laid, and the first seven conspirators, led by Ballard and Babington, were executed on 20 September 1586, &#145;not without some note of cruelty&#146;, according to Camden: that is to say, they were hanged only for a short time, cut down while they were still alive, and then castrated and disembowelled. Their statements on the gallows varied in import and effect. Babington cried &#145;&#147;<i>Parce mihi, domine Jesus</i>&#148;, that is &#147;Spare me Lord Jesus&#148;&#146;. Tichborne made a long speech: &#145;I am a bad orator and my text is worse&#146;, he began. He blamed Babington, with whom he had lived in &#145;flourishing estate&#146;, for drawing him in. He acknowledged his fault &#145;and moved great pity among the multitude towards him, as in like manner did Tilney, a man of a modest spirit and goodly personage&#146;. By contrast, &#145;Abington, being a man of a turbulent spirit, cast forth threats and terrors of blood to be spilt ere long in England&#146;  (Camden, 308).<br>
<br>The other seven were brought to the scaffold the next day and suffered the same death, &#145;but, more favourably, by the Queens commandment, who detested the former cruelty&#146;  (Camden, 308). They hung until they were dead and only then suffered the barbarity of castration and disembowelling. Salisbury, very penitently, warned Catholics not to attempt to restore religion by force of arms. Jones condemned Babington's &#145;proud and headstrong mind&#146;. Gage extolled the queen's bounty to his father and detested his own &#145;perfidious ingratitude&#146;. The last to suffer was Jerome Bellamy, caught up in the business at the very end for hiding Babington and the others at his family's house in Harrow; his brother had strangled himself in prison  (ibid., 309).<h2>
<a name="Aftermath"></a>Aftermath</h2>The penalties for treason did not end with this brutality, for the lands and goods of convicted men were forfeit to the crown. In practice this severity was sometimes tempered. While the lands of Edward Jones seem all to have been forfeit, the entailed estates of his friend Thomas Salisbury passed to his brother John so that the Lleweni dynasty continued. Similarly, the entailed Babington lands passed successively to Anthony's brothers Francis and George, while other of his lands were forfeited and granted by the queen to Sir Walter Ralegh.<br>
<br>Reaction to the plot was predictably hostile. Two tracts were published in the following year: George Whetstone's <span class="italic">The Censure of a Loyal Subject</span> (1587) is a brief account in dialogue form of the executions, and W. Kempe's <span class="italic">A Dutiful Invective Against the Moste Haynous Treasons of Ballard and Babington</span> (1587) is a piece of clumsy doggerel covering the same unhappy ground. A more serious account of the matter was Bishop George Carleton's <span class="italic">A Thankfull Remembrance of God's Mercy</span> (4th edn, 1630), a description of various plots against monarchy and church, designed to demonstrate that both were protected by God's special mercy. The Roman Catholic church seems to have kept relative silence about the plotters, none of whom has ever been included in its lists of martyrs for the faith.<br>
<br>The significance of the Babington plot lay not in the capture and punishment of fourteen inept and unfortunate conspirators, but in the death of Mary Stewart, whose fate was bound up with theirs. She was the target at whom Walsingham had aimed all along. Throughout the entire course of the plot he had controlled events, knowing better than the conspirators what was going on. Did he create the plot as well as control it? The surviving evidence leaves much uncertain. It is hard to say when the plot originated and who began it. Gilbert Gifford may have been its begetter, but it is not certain that he was in Walsingham's pay at that point. Certainly Ballard, who recruited Babington, was not. However, without the provision of a system by which mail could be got to and from Mary, the plot would not have gone forward as it did; and that system was of Walsingham's devising. He could have stopped the plot well before he actually did, but he let it run on until he could be sure that he had the evidence against Mary. For how much of that evidence was he responsible? Probably for the forged postscript to Mary's fatal letter, just possibly for other sentences in it. But whatever the truth of that, Mary was undoubtedly aware of the plot and condoned it. One other point should be noted about these events: for all the efforts made by Ballard to raise support, the leading Catholics in England were loyal to the monarch and rebuffed his overtures. The real backing for the conspiracy lay abroad, with Mendoza in Paris and Philip II in the Escorial.<br>
<br>The poem called <span class="italic">Tichborne's Elegy</span> was written by Chidiock Tichborne in the Tower before his execution. Its final stanza may serve as an epitaph for all the conspirators:<blockquote>
<div>I sought my death and found it in my womb,<br>
</div>
<div>I looked for life and saw it was a shade;<br>
</div>
<div>I trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,<br>
</div>
<div>And now I die, and now I was but made.<br>
</div>
<div>My glass is full, and now my glass is run,<br>
</div>
<div>And now I live, and now my life is done.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
