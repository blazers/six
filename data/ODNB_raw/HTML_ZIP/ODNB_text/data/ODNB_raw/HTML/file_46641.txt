<span class="headword">Bonsor, Sir  (Henry) Cosmo Orme</span>, first baronet  (1848&#150;1929), <span class="occ">brewer and railway manager</span>, was born on 2 September 1848 at Great Bookham, near Dorking, Surrey. He was the son of Joseph Bonsor (1807&#150;1873) of Polesden Lacey, Surrey, a partner from 1852 in the London brewing firm of Combe, Delafield &amp; Co. (later Combe &amp; Co.), and his wife, Eliza Denne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Orme. In 1865, after an education at Eton College, Cosmo joined the family brewing firm (his father was by this time the senior partner). He quickly established himself as a competent manager, orchestrating the company's expansion through the purchase of public houses and smaller breweries, and emphasizing the retailing and marketing functions of the business. He was also the driving force behind the incorporation and amalgamation of important brewing interests in London. He joined the board of Watney &amp; Co. when it became a limited company in 1885, and in 1888 became a director of his own firm on its incorporation.<br>
<br>In 1898 the interests of Combe, Watney, and a third company, Reid's Brewery, were merged as Watney, Combe, Reid &amp; Co., and Bonsor became its first chairman, a post he retained for thirty years. Capitalized at &pound;15 million, it was not only the largest brewing company of its day, but also the biggest company in British manufacturing. However, with its evident over-capitalization and high gearing, the new giant was a daunting prospect for any manager. It says much for Bonsor's tenacity and financial acumen that he stayed on to pull the company round from the bad times (no dividend was paid on the deferred ordinary shares, 1908&#150;16) to comparative security in the 1920s. The written-down capital was restored in 1922&#150;5, and the company was strong enough to embark on a fresh wave of merger activity, acquiring the Cobham, Isleworth, Higgins, and London and Burton breweries in 1923&#150;9. Bonsor was also a strong supporter of the brewing lobbies, serving as chairman and treasurer of the National Trade Defence Association from its establishment in 1888 to 1895. He was master of the Brewers' Company in 1881 and a vice-president of the Institute of Brewing from 1901.<br>
<br>Bonsor was also for many years manager of another controversial large corporation&#151;the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Elected chairman of the South Eastern Railway in 1898, and thereby inheriting the dubious legacy of the recently retired Sir Edward Watkin (1819&#150;1901), Bonsor did much to restore stability between that company and its long-term rival, the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway. In 1899 he organized a &#145;working union&#146; of the two companies, in the form of a merger which fell short of a full financial amalgamation. Bonsor acted as chairman of the South Eastern and Chatham managing committee, until the merged companies were themselves amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923. During his tenure of office the two railways, once the butt of music-hall jokes, became models of technical advance, efficiency, and competent management, although the price of rationalization was high, resulting in the addition of &pound;9 million to the capital account between 1899 and 1912.<br>
<br>Bonsor also had other business interests. He was a director of the Bank of England for forty-four years (1885&#150;1929), and of the Northern Assurance Company, and was for thirty-nine years chairman of the income tax commissioners for the City of London (1886&#150;1925). He was also treasurer of Guy's Hospital and Conservative MP for Wimbledon from 1885 to 1900. He was created a baronet in 1925, and was a JP and deputy lieutenant for Surrey and a deputy lieutenant and alderman of the City of London. He was also an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. In 1872 he married Emily Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fellowes, of Dorset; they had three sons and four daughters. After his wife's death in 1882 he married Mabel Brand of Croydon.<br>
<br>Frank, open, likeable, and a good talker, Bonsor had an excellent grasp of financial affairs, and was supported by solid political connections. He also had the gift of choosing competent subordinates. His memorable achievement was to take five of Britain's problematic companies and fuse them into rationalized, more efficient units&#151;a model others would have done well to follow. Bonsor died on 4 December 1929 at boulevard Carabacel in Nice.<br>
