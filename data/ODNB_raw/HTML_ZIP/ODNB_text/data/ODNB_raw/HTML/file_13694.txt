<span class="headword">Hoker <span class="st"> [Hooker]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1525&#150;1543), <span class="occ">author</span>, was a member of the Hoker family from the region of Maidstone, Kent. Hoker became a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1525. He graduated as BA in 1527, and proceeded to MA in 1535 and bachelor of theology in 1540. Hoker was praised by John Leland, in his <span class="italic">Cygnea cantio</span> (1545), where he includes a line of praise for &#145;Hocherus nitor artium bonarum&#146;  (sig. E1<i>v</i>). He lectured at his college in many subjects, including natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and, between 1541 and 1543, theology. Several literary works are attributed to Hoker, although many have not survived. These include &#145;Piscator&#146; (or &#145;The Fisher Caught&#146;), which Thomas Warton believed to have been a comedy acted by the students of Magdalen College, as well as an introduction to rhetoric and various poems and epigrams.<br>
<br>A letter from Hoker, apparently to Bullinger and dating from approximately 1538, was published along with an edition of <span class="italic">S. Clementis epistolae duae ad Corinthios</span> (1687), and printed in an English translation by Gorham. In this letter Hoker describes the recent exposure and destruction of a &#145;wooden god&#146; in Kent, a mechanical idol apparently able to &#145;nod with his head, to scowl with his eyes, to wag his beard, to curve his body, to reject and receive the prayers of pilgrims&#146;. Hoker writes that the idol was taken from its place in a Kentish church by the brother of a certain Nicholas Partridge, who opened it up in front of the local parishioners to show its internal mechanical workings; from there it was taken to London, denounced, and thrown to an indignant audience who smashed it into pieces. The <span class="italic">Life of Sir Peter Carew</span> occasionally attributed to Hoker was in fact written by his namesake, John Hooker, alias Vowell, of Exeter.<br>
