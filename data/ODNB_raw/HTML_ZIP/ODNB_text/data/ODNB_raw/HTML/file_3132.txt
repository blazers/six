<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyle,  Michael</span>  (1609/10&#150;1702), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland and Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3134/', "Richard Boyle (c.1574&#150;1645)")</script>, archbishop of Tuam between 1638 and 1645, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Richard or John Wright of Catherine Hill. A member of a cadet branch of the prolific tribe of Boyles which colonized public offices and the established Church of Ireland, Michael Boyle graduated BA from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1637. In the same year he was incorporated as MA at Trinity College, Oxford. Local links immediately secured his preferment to the parish of Clonpriest, one of the richest in the diocese of Cloyne. In 1640 he was advanced to the deanery of Cloyne. Enjoyment of these emoluments was soon interrupted by the outbreak of the confederate war and personal tragedy. Boyle, who had married, probably in the late 1630s, Margaret, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26902/', "George Synge")</script>, bishop of Cloyne, lost his wife and their only daughter in 1641 when they drowned at sea. At about the same time Boyle offered his services as chaplain to the protestant forces in the province of Munster and later in the 1640s Boyle married the Hon. Mary, daughter of Dermod O'Brien, fifth Baron Inchiquin, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20463/', "Murrough O'Brien, first earl of Inchiquin")</script>. They had three sons and six daughters. Boyle's new connections (the sixth baron was commander of the protestant army) may have assisted him into the post of chaplain-general. His skills as an emissary were soon revealed. He seems to have followed his brother-in-law in aligning with Charles I rather than the Westminster parliament in 1648. He was looked upon as the head of the protestant clergy of Munster who remained loyal to the Stuarts throughout the revolutions of the late 1640s. As such, Inchiquin addressed to him queries about the stance of the clergy, some of whom were acknowledging the regime which had succeeded the executed Charles I.<br>
<br>Unlike many of his colleagues and some within his own family, Boyle stayed aloof from the new government. Continuing in Munster, he provided one of several channels through which the exiled royalists could be informed of opinion and opportunities in the area. In December 1652 he was with his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3135/', "Richard Boyle, second earl of Cork")</script>, the head of the Boyles in Ireland. He also attended the wedding at Youghal in 1656 of one of Cork's daughters. Again, in the uncertain time late in 1659, Boyle dined with Cork. It is likely that Boyle travelled covertly between England and Ireland during the interregnum. Boyle's loyalty was acknowledged and his losses recompensed when he received lands formerly owned by Sir Hardress Waller in 1660. The grant was confirmed in the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> of 1662.<br>
<br>Boyle's unimpeachable loyalty and his considerable sufferings brought his advancement to the bishopric of Cork in August 1660. He also held six sinecures in the diocese until attacked for doing so by his kinsman the earl of Orrery, lord president of Munster. Boyle's capacity for business, especially to safeguard the material interests of the church, attracted favourable notice. In addition, his record, coupled with diplomacy, enabled him to escape the suspicions to which those in his family such as Orrery and Cork, who had collaborated with the previous regime, were prone. In the autumn of 1660 he was sent to London to advance the claims of the established Church of Ireland for compensation. In 1661 the Irish convocation chose him as one of its agents to solicit in England: a tribute to his skills and perhaps to the links with English bishops and courtiers forged during the 1650s. In November 1661 he appeared before the English council, but meetings with the lord chancellor, the earl of Clarendon, and Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, convinced him that the Irish church had pitched its claims too high. The lord lieutenant, the duke of Ormond, backed his translation to the archdiocese of Dublin in November 1663. Already Boyle had been sworn of the Irish privy council, but his more regular presence in Dublin meant that he frequently attended. As an astute observer of politics, both secular and ecclesiastical, he was valued by Ormond as an informant. In 1665 his skills, together with the political interest which he commanded (particularly in Munster), led to his appointment as lord chancellor. Boyle accurately protested that he lacked any great proficiency in the law. On occasion he had expressed dislike of the common lawyers, and hoped that the clergy might no longer be harassed in the courts. Initially Boyle deputed much of the work of chancery to a keeper of the seal. However, this stratagem did not deflect the criticism of those opposed on principle to the choice of a cleric and those simply contemptuous of Boyle. He sought to improve chancery procedures to the extent of issuing orders for its regulation in 1668. These were repeated in 1673 and 1685, perhaps indicating that they had had only a limited effect.<br>
<br>The office of lord chancellor brought Boyle additional patronage, fees, and further chances of surreptitious enrichment. In 1672 his rents alone yielded &pound;1941. In 1686 he was listed among a score in Ireland worth more than &pound;2000 p.a. A sign of his increasing wealth was the acquisition of a country property at Blessington, in co. Wicklow. During the 1670s he erected a large mansion there, which was lavishly embellished and furnished. He also undertook the improvement of the archiepiscopal residence of St Sepulchre's in Dublin. Detractors pointed not just to this unabashed enjoyment of his wealth, but to delays and partiality in chancery and to torpor in his diocese. On 8 March 1673 it was alleged that under the &#145;proud and insolent&#146; Boyle, the whole kingdom groaned  (Conway, letter, de Vesci MSS, H/15). These criticisms did not lessen the confidence of the administration in his abilities. Boyle skilfully picked his way through the contending factions within the Irish council. In 1677 it was rumoured that he might be translated to Canterbury in succession to Sheldon. Early in 1679 Ormond, again lord lieutenant, had him translated to the primatial see of Armagh. He was named three times to the triumvirate of lords justices who governed in the absence of a lord lieutenant or lord deputy.<br>
<br>Complaints were voiced that Boyle as lord chancellor had allowed overt or covert Catholics to be included in the county commissions of the peace. To some Irish protestants this seemed the more culpable as the panic over the Popish Plot spread to Ireland. Boyle's marriage into the O'Brien family, the earls of Inchiquin, some of whom had remained Catholic, was also used to embarrass him politically. However, with the storms of the Popish Plot and exclusion weathered, and a tory reaction setting in, he was vulnerable to attack on other grounds. Some noted that he had not purged the magistracy of all who had served the Cromwellians. The truth was that Boyle, whatever his failings as a judge, was too closely identified with the English protestant interest in Ireland to join enthusiastically in the restitution of Catholics to offices and lands. As the political atmosphere altered under James II, he was replaced as chancellor in 1686. The lord lieutenant at the time praised Boyle as an able and loyal servant of the crown, but admitted that he had a large following beyond his dependants in chancery. As archbishop of Armagh he retained considerable power, but did nothing openly to challenge the Catholic <i>revanche</i>.<br>
<br>Increasing incapacity, first physical and then mental, diminished Boyle's influence. Already in 1689 he was thought &#145;decrepit&#146;  (J. Bonnell to J. Strype, 19 April 1689, BL, Stowe MS 746, fol. 191). He did not join wealthy protestants fleeing from Ireland. However, in 1690 he quickly rallied to the new monarchs, hoping thereby to prevent any religious settlement which might comprehend or tolerate the dissenters. When archbishop of Dublin, although his see contained a sizeable population of protestant nonconformists, he had protected individuals against the full rigour of the laws, but he did not favour a general toleration. By 1697, reportedly both blind and deaf, he left other, younger bishops such as Narcissus Marsh, Samuel Foley, William King, and Nathaniel Foy to devise and apply measures to invigorate the established church, although Boyle's inactivity, it was felt, frustrated reform. Before old age slowed him, however, during more than three decades as a bishop he had deployed legal rather than spiritual weapons in the battle against the many adversaries of the Church of Ireland. Concurrently, in the traditions of his family, he enriched himself. Boyle died on 10 December 1702 at his house in Oxmantown, near Dublin, in the ninety-third year of his age, and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.<br>

<a name="cosubject_3132"></a><span class="headword">Murrough Boyle</span>, first Viscount Blessington  (1648&#150;1718), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was the son and heir of Michael Boyle and his second wife, Mary. Murrough matriculated from Trinity College, Dublin, on 18 August 1662, and was MP for Kilmallock during 1665&#150;6. He married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1668), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21317/', "John Parker")</script>, archbishop of Dublin. They had one daughter. Mary died on 13 September 1668, and in November 1672 Boyle married Lady Anne (<i>d</i>. 1725), daughter of Charles Coote, second earl of Mountrath. They had two sons and two daughters. On 23 August 1673 Boyle was created Viscount Blessington in the peerage of Ireland. He was governor of Limerick and constable of Limerick Castle from 1679 until 1692. Blessington was inclined to drama rather than politics, writing a play, <span class="italic">The Lost Princess</span>, which has been described as &#145;truly contemptible&#146;  (Baker, 1.58). Blessington died on 26 April 1718 at Islandbridge, co. Dublin, and was buried on 29 April with his father in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. His widow died on 5 April 1725 and was buried on 11 April in the same vault. The title was inherited by his son Charles (<i>d</i>. 1732), who died without issue, whereupon his peerage became extinct.<br>
