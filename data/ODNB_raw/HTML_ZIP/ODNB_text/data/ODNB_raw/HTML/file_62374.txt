<span class="headword">Heslop,  Harold</span>  (1898&#150;1983), <span class="occ">coalminer and author</span>, was born on 1 October 1898 in the village of Rough Lea, Hunwick, co. Durham, the second of the eight children of William Heslop, coalminer, and his wife, Isobel (or Isabella), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitfield. The Heslops had been miners for several generations; Heslop's father was deputy at Rough Lea colliery (managed by his grandfather) and later an overman at neighbouring Bitchburn colliery. Heslop won a scholarship to King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland. When he was fourteen, however, his father was appointed manager of an ironstone mine at Boulby on the north Yorkshire coast; the nearest grammar school, at Guisborough, was too far to walk, so he began working underground at Boulby.<br>
<br>Within a few months his mother died in labour. William Heslop remarried almost immediately and accepted a job as manager of a reopened seam at Wylam in Northumberland. The family moved again and Heslop started work there, but his stepmother had children of her own and encouraged her stepchildren to leave home. Heslop moved to South Shields and started work at Harton colliery, where he remained for the next eleven years, apart from a few months' training with the 110th Royal Hussars at the end of the First World War. He was secretary of his Independent Labour Party branch and active in his union lodge, which he represented on the council of the Durham Miners' Association.<br>
<br>In 1923 Heslop applied for a Durham Miners' Association scholarship to study at the Central Labour College in London, earning the highest marks out of a hundred candidates that year, and he studied at the college from 1924 to 1926. It seems likely that he joined the Communist Party while he was in London. He met Phyllis Hannah Varndell, a young ledger clerk at Selfridges from a family active in the Social Democratic Federation; her father, Samuel Varndell, was a sculptor. They married at Lambeth register office on 27 March 1926.<br>
<br>While at the college Heslop wrote a novel about the activities of the communist-led minority movement in the Durham coalfield. He could not find a publisher for it, but Ivan Maysky, secretary to the Soviet legation in London, arranged for it to be published in 1926 as <span class="italic">Pod vlastu uglya</span> (&#145;Under the sway of coal&#146;) in the Soviet Union, where it sold over half a million copies.<br>
<br>The Heslops returned to South Shields in October 1926, in time to see the Durham miners go back to work, defeated again after a stoppage lasting nearly seven months. Because he refused a clerical job at Harton colliery it was another five months before he was working. He taught classes in Marxism and economics for the National Council of Labour Colleges in South Shields and Newcastle, and contested the Shields ward (unsuccessfully) for the Labour Party in local elections of 1927. He was also active in the minority movement inside the Durham Miners' Association, and wrote two penny-pamphlets attacking the anti-trade union sentiments of the local Northern Press newspapers, <span class="italic">Who are your Masters</span>? (1927) and <span class="italic">Who are your Masters Now</span>? (1927).<br>
<br>At the end of 1927 Harton colliery made 900 men redundant, including Heslop. He and Phyllis moved to live with her mother in London, where he found occasional work as a labourer between long periods of unemployment. He published two novels, <span class="italic">The Gate of a Strange Field</span> (1929) about the general strike and <span class="italic">Journey Beyond</span> (1930) about unemployment in London. He returned north during the general election campaign in 1929 to support the Communist Party general secretary, Harry Pollitt, who stood against Ramsay MacDonald for the Seaham division of Durham. He also helped Bob Ellis to write and edit the minority movement paper <span class="italic">The Worker</span>.<br>
<br>In November 1930 Heslop and Ellis attended the second conference of the International Union of Proletarian and Revolutionary Writers in Kharkov in Ukraine; there he met senior Comintern literary intellectuals including Mikhail Sholokhov, Louis Aragon, and Alexander Fadayev. He returned a convinced admirer of Soviet communism. At the same time he was important to the Soviet literary apparatus. Four of his novels were published in the Soviet Union, including <span class="italic">Red Earth</span> (1931), a utopian novel about a successful revolution in Britain which was never published in the UK. The Soviets even considered filming <span class="italic">Pod vlastu uglya</span> with a script by the novelist Yevgeny Zamyatin, whom Heslop met in Leningrad in 1930.<br>
<br>Back in London, Ivan Maysky found Heslop work at Arcos, the Soviet trading mission in London; in 1935 he moved to the London office of Intourist. Four more books followed, to very considerable critical acclaim: <span class="italic">Goaf</span> (1934), an English version of <span class="italic">Plod vlastu uglya</span>; a detective novel, <span class="italic">The Crime of Peter Ropner</span> (1934); <span class="italic">Last Cage Down</span> (1935); and (as Lincoln J. White) <span class="italic">Abdication</span> (1937), a study written with Bob Ellis about the abdication crisis, which sold over 40,000 copies.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the Heslops and their two children, Maril and Michael, moved to Taunton in Somerset. There he finished his last and most successful novel, <span class="italic">The Earth Beneath</span> (1946). It was a rich and scholarly history of work and family life in the Durham coalfield in the nineteenth century, Methodism and socialism, poaching and preaching, and the bitter struggles to establish trade unionism. The novel sold 9000 copies and was translated into Italian. It was published in the USA, where it was entered for the MGM movie contest; the novelist Pearl Buck declared it &#145;one of the best novels I have read&#146;  (letter to Heslop, 1947, Heslop MSS).<br>
<br>In 1948 Heslop began working for the Ordnance Survey in Taunton. He was still active in the Labour Party: secretary of the Taunton constituency Labour Party, he twice stood for Taunton council and contested North Devon as Labour candidate in the general election of 1955. Although he continued to write for the rest of his life (including an autobiography) he never had anything published again. He died in Tone Valley Hospital, Taunton, on 10 November 1983.<br>
<br>Almost single-handed Heslop created the mining novel in Britain. Other miner&#150;novelists were later able to build on his achievements. But it was Heslop who first proved that it was possible to write about life in a pit village without D. H. Lawrence's scorn or George Orwell's sentimentality.<br>
