</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maginn,  William</span>  (1794&#150;1842), <span class="occ">writer and poet</span>, was born on 10 July 1794 in Dean Street, Cork, near the cathedral of St Fin-Barre, the first child of the six children of John Maginn (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1819), classics master at the diocesan school, and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eccles, daughter of William Eccles of Ecclesville, Tyrone. His father quickly discovered a star pupil, and stories circulated in Cork for years about the young William's brilliance. At eleven (1806) he entered Trinity College, Dublin, ranking near the top of examinations in Latin and Greek, and taking the premium in Hebrew. Under the tutelage of Samuel Kyle (later provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and bishop of Cork) and the formidably eccentric John Barrett, he acquired some dozen additional languages, living and dead, though the college reception of his Latin poem <span class="italic">&AElig;neas Eunuchus</span> left something to be desired. He was awarded an LLD in 1819, reputedly the youngest to be so honoured. His background and education gave him strong unionist and establishment views.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsinCork"></a>Early years in Cork</h2>After Maginn took his BA in 1811, his father opened an academy at 8 Marlboro Street, the family home, and dragooned his teenage son as classics master. The new school rapidly gained a reputation for academic excellence, while the young William raked about town and earned a reputation as a mimic, jokester, and master of lampoons. The closest he came to the church career envisioned for him was through ghost-writing sermons for clerical friends. He moved in both the protestant and Catholic middle classes, and with his fluent Irish mingled freely with the poor. He first published in a local satiric paper, <span class="italic">The Freeholder</span>, and joined the Cork Literary and Philosophical Society, though a slight stutter kept him from starring as a debater. Using a remarkable variety of pseudonyms, Maginn began sending contributions abroad about 1818, first to London and William Jerdan's <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>, and then in 1819 to Edinburgh and <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (&#145;Maga&#146;), where his first efforts were a parody of Wordsworth titled &#145;Don Juan Unread&#146; and a clever rendering of the ballad of &#145;Chevy Chase&#146; into a rustic Latin (November 1819). (Maginn frequently &#145;embalmed&#146; folk poetry in classical languages.) Known by Blackwood only as Ralph Tuckett Scott, Maginn was encouraged to expand a squib on Edinburgh University professor John Leslie into &#145;Leslie <i>versus</i> Hebrew&#146; (February 1820); the publisher rued his suggestion throughout a lengthy libel case.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in 1819, Maginn became master of the school, while his sisters opened a female academy in a house next door. Leaving all thoughts of the ministry behind, he dutifully supported his family and prepared his brother John for Trinity. Though far away and harassed by pedagogy, he quickly became one of the inner coterie of &#145;Maga&#146;, along with John Wilson, John Gibson Lockhart, and Thomas Hamilton, and during the summer vacation of 1821 he ventured to Edinburgh on a surprise visit to meet the rest of the gang. Turning up in William Blackwood's Princes Street shop, he demanded in his thickest brogue to know the name of the prolific Cork contributor. Blackwood hemmed and hawed until Maginn pulled out Blackwood's own letters and said &#145;I am that gentleman&#146;. Amused by his youth and learning, his new friends dubbed him the Doctor.<br>
<br>While Lockhart initiated <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> most popular feature, the collaborative &#145;Noctes Ambrosianae&#146;, Maginn shortly after enlisted with Wilson and gradually became associated by the public with one of its characters, Sir Morgan Odoherty. Odoherty's speciality was the celebration of drink, cigars, and the convivial life&#151;epitomized in the &#145;Maxims of Mr Odoherty&#146; in 1824 (reprinted in book form, 1849). Despite attempts to lure him to Scotland, after a scouting trip to London during which he met Jerdan, L. E. L. (the poet Letitia Landon, to whom Maginn may have made a proposal), and Theodore Hook, he determined to move there as soon as possible. When his brother John graduated from Trinity and could replace him at the academy, he made new arrangements, both professional and matrimonial. To the astonishment of his Cork cronies, he married Ellen Ryder Bullen (<i>d</i>. 1859) at Christ's Church, Cork, on 31 January 1824. She was the daughter of a clergyman and her brother had been Maginn's student. Enticed by an offer of employment (&pound;20 a month) with Theodore Hook on an expanded <span class="italic">John Bull</span> newspaper, Maginn with his new wife and his sister Margaret arrived in London the next month.<h2>
<a name="ScribblinginLondon18241829"></a>Scribbling in London, 1824&#150;1829</h2>In London he renewed his acquaintance with fellow Corkmen and associated with Jerdan, Landon, Thomas Barnes (of <span class="italic">The Times</span>), publisher John Murray, and the critic John Wilson Croker. The flow of writing to <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> continued, regularly remunerated now for the first time, and Blackwood's and Lockhart's visit to London in the spring revealed a man in his element, ensconced in the Salopian Coffee House and surrounded by the gentlemen of the press. In the summer, however, he made a mistake by editing <span class="italic">John Bull Magazine</span>, a short-lived monthly advertised as written by &#145;plain People&#146; who &#145;drink ale with their cheese, and ask twice for their soup if they want it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Examiner</span>, 27 June 1824, 414). It was launched with a forged &#145;wedding night&#146; episode of Byron's burnt memoirs, and Maginn immediately lost <i>ton</i>, being charged with a &#145;familiar intimacy with all the blackguard publications of the age&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, June 1826, 208). John Murray, who had toyed with the notion of selecting Maginn to edit Byron's letters, redirected that project to Thomas Moore.<br>
<br>In the autumn the Maginns moved lodgings to Brunswick Square, where their first child, Ellen, was born. By the next year, however, Maginn was in financial difficulties; an attempt to secure a post on a new commission to regularize the state papers was rejected by J. W. Croker, who nevertheless alerted home secretary Robert Peel to Maginn's possible value as tory propagandist. The autumn of 1825 saw him busily attempting to write his way out of debt, when he was rescued by Benjamin Disraeli, then a twenty-year-old with a scheme to use Murray's backing to start a new tory daily (<span class="italic">The Representative</span>). Maginn accepted the post of Paris correspondent (&pound;500 per annum). After William's trip to Ireland on family business, the Maginns moved to France, where a few days after their arrival in late December Ellen gave birth to Anne, a &#145;sickly yonker&#146;  (Cooke, 627), in their lodgings at Hotel d'Hungerford (31 rue Caumartin). Maginn sent the odd column back to London, but chiefly polished his French (including Parisian thieves' argot) and translated a humorous farrago on food, <span class="italic">Physiologie du go&ucirc;t</span>. &#145;The Rip&#146; was badly managed, however, and Murray recalled Maginn in March to salvage things. While his editing produced a more lively and consistent paper, its losses could not be sustained and &#145;The Rip&#146; was merged with the <span class="italic">New Times</span> after the summer election. Maginn transferred to this paper, probably as a sub-editor.<br>
<br>In the late 1820s Maginn continued to write sporadically for <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, collaborating with Lockhart on several new &#145;Noctes&#146;; he also translated Vidocq's memoirs, worked with Crofton Croker on his <span class="italic">Fairy Legends</span>, contributed a few fine tales to the annuals, and in 1827 published <span class="italic">Whitehall: or, Days of George IV</span> (a spoof of historical novels). In that year as well his family was completed by the birth of a son, John. He may also have written a true crime version of a famous murder, <span class="italic">The Red Barn</span> (1828). But his chief livelihood came from the evening <span class="italic">Standard</span>, a daily launched to support the ultra-tory side after the pro-Catholic emancipation George Canning became premier in 1827. The paper was named after a tag from Livy that also gave Morgan Odoherty the sobriquet the Standard-Bearer, and was edited by Stanley Lees Giffard, a staunch Orangeman whom Maginn knew from Trinity College. After the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> was passed in 1829, <span class="italic">The Standard</span> vociferously accused Peel and Wellington of &#145;ratting&#146;. Maginn served as sub- or co-editor until the late 1830s, drawing an income of more than &pound;400 per annum, and wrote many of the leaders.<h2>
<a name="FrasersMagazine18301842"></a>Fraser's Magazine, 1830&#150;1842</h2>Late in 1829 Maginn decided that London needed its own &#145;Maga&#146;. William Blackwood had grown shy of controversy, and Maginn's tendency to &#145;run-a-muck&#146; in &#145;personalities&#146;  (Gordon, 309) was unwelcome. With a lawyer friend, Hugh Fraser, providing the ready money, Maginn convinced James Fraser (no relation) to make his publishing d&eacute;but with <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country</span> (February 1830; nicknamed &#145;Regina&#146;). The story goes that they were perambulating Regent Street when Maginn spied a bookshop at no. 215 and said, &#145;Fraser! here is a namesake of yours&#151;let us try him&#146;  (Kenealy, 87). While not technically the editor, Maginn was chiefly responsible for its direction and content, and wrote a high percentage of its articles. After a slow start it became an original and powerful organ, combining a rollicking scurrility&#151;not above the occasional hoax or libel&#151;with advanced and intellectually challenging new writing. It was the first to publish, for instance, Thomas Carlyle's <span class="italic">Sartor Resartus</span>. The most popular feature was a long-running &#145;Gallery of illustrious literary characters&#146; (collected in book form, 1873) that featured brief and biting prose sketches by Maginn and portraits by Daniel Maclise, a young artist from Cork whom Maginn had befriended. Nine of the first ten writers profiled were Scots or Irish, and the magazine as a whole relied on a Celtic pool of talent. Somewhat later it was enhanced by a young discovery named Thackeray, who later based Captain Shandon in <span class="italic">Pendennis</span> partly on Maginn.<br>
<br>At the heart of <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> was a round table in James Fraser's back parlour, where the Fraserians gathered to put together the magazine, write squibs on Lytton Bulwer, or Robert &#145;Satan&#146; Montgomery, and drink whiskey punch in bacchanalias that were then exaggerated in the magazine. It is no surprise that the chief accusation spread about Maginn by his enemies was that he was constantly inebriated, and this was no doubt true. Odoherty's twenty-fifth maxim was that &#145;A man saving his wine must be cut savagely&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, May 1824, 604), and Maginn ran no risk of being cut. He wrote dozens of drinking-songs and once found thirty-seven rhymes for &#145;a jug of gin-twist&#146;. In defence, it was noted that he did not tipple more than other men; he was just unable to hold it, and this is probably true as well. His &#145;A Story without a Tail&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, April 1834) perfectly embodies a life of feckless feasting and reckless drinking.<br>
<br>Maginn was now one of the best-known and most influential literary figures in London, though he deliberately avoided publishing books and preferred anonymity. But despite a substantial income, his liabilities continued to mount and in 1834 he fled to Belgium while Lockhart collected a subscription to settle about &pound;3000 of debt. His reputation was also damaged by rumours that he had not only been writing leaders for <span class="italic">The Age</span>, but also co-operating with its editor, Charles Molloy Westmacott, a blackmailer. A more personal trouble occurred at about the same time. Maginn was a fond father and husband, though frequently absent from his home at 55 Stanford Street, hiding from duns (often in the Irish-speaking slum of St Giles). In 1834 Landon, who since about 1822 had been the secret mistress of Jerdan, became engaged to John Forster. Rumours flew that she had been or was the lover of Bulwer, Maclise, and Maginn as well. Although the evidence is thin, Ellen Maginn apparently searched her husband's belongings, found letters from Landon that seemed to indicate intimacy, and brought them to Forster's attention, thus breaking off the marriage. Maginn was able to convince his wife that the letters were innocent, but their marriage suffered. Landon was devastated and a few years later made an odd marriage to George Maclean, who took her to his colonial outpost in Africa. When she died there under mysterious circumstances, Maginn was publicly distraught. L. E. L. and Maginn certainly enjoyed a long friendship and close working relationship, though friction occurred when Landon entered the circle of Bulwer and his <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>. There is no firm evidence, however, that Maginn was her lover, and much evidence against posthumous allegations that he blackmailed her or sent her anonymous letters.<br>
<br>Oddly enough, Maginn, whom Daniel O'Connell dubbed &#145;that hoary headed libeller&#146;  (Kenealy, 93), caused only two suits against <span class="italic">Fraser's</span>. The first came when Alaric &#145;Attila&#146; Watts, dubbed the &#145;principal fribble among the namby-pambies of the Annuals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fraser's</span>, July 1831, cover), took umbrage over Maclise's drawing of him sneaking downstairs with pictures under his arms, and Maginn's jibes about his backbiting propensities. Watts won a partial victory (5 December 1835) after Fraser's defence was thrown out on a technicality. The second case was the more serious. Maginn skewered the honourable Grantley Berkeley's egotistical novel, <span class="italic">Berkeley Castle</span>, in <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> (August 1836). Grantley, accompanied by his brother Craven, surprised James Fraser alone in his shop, and nearly killed him with a lead-weighted riding crop. They were arraigned at the Marlborough Street station and released on bond&#151;though Fraser later decided to seek damages in civil court, and Berkeley counter-sued him for libel.<br>
<br>Maginn claimed that in Ireland &#145;for dueling purposes&#146; a gentleman was a man &#145;who wore a clean shirt once a week&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fraser's</span>, &#145;Defence&#146;, 14. 368), and he generally found the Code Duello ridiculous. &#145;Bob Burke's duel with Ensign Brady of the 48th&#146; is one of the great comic takes on duelling  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, 1834). Nevertheless, hearing of the assault he immediately sent his card to Berkeley House. The encounter between the sportsman and crack shot and the tipsy journalist was fought in a field off the Harrow Road on the evening of 5 August. Aim, steady or not, was taken thrice, with both parties missing each time; Maginn's second, Hugh Fraser, then interceded. As they entered Fraser's carriage to return to town, the Berkeley brothers shouted insults after them.<br>
<br>After the duel Maginn wrote a signed &#145;Defence&#146; for <span class="italic">Fraser's</span>, and seems to have decided, at long last, to write for posterity. While he contributed to <span class="italic">Fraser's</span>, his friendship with the publisher understandably cooled, and when Richard Bentley began a new magazine with Charles Dickens at the helm, Maginn was part of the team. After 1836 he wrote much of his best work: the &#145;Shakespeare papers&#146; in <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> and in <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> the &#145;Homeric Ballads&#146;, translations from Lucian, and a number of scholarly essays (for example, &#145;Farmer on the learning of Shakespeare&#146;). Unfortunately, his financial situation sank as fast as works flew from his pen, and he also scribbled for the weekly papers (notably <span class="italic">The Age</span> and <span class="italic">The Argus</span>) and briefly edited the <span class="italic">Lancashire Herald</span> (Liverpool, 1838&#150;9). From debtor's prison itself he contributed to <span class="italic">Fleet Papers</span>, <span class="italic">The Town</span>, <span class="italic">The Squib</span>, and the new <span class="italic">Punch</span> (their respective editors were briefly fellow inmates).<br>
<br>Sir Robert Peel had brought in a Conservative government in 1841, and despite his lampooning of Peel, Maginn had hoped for some reward for his partisan services. A number of his political essays in <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> had been popular as pamphlets, and like Peel he urged the development of a post-Reform &#145;conservative&#146; party. When no government offers surfaced, he believed that Peel held a personal grudge. In fact, Peel had funnelled &pound;100 to Ellen Maginn through Giffard, but she elected not to tell her husband for fear he might turn it down. With money running out after Maginn's death a public subscription was announced (the king of Hanover gave a further &pound;100), and Francis Mahony saw that the Literary Fund Society made a grant. On the form under &#145;Causes of distress&#146; Mahony entered &#145;The casualties of a life wholly dependent on literature&#146;  (Royal Literary Fund archives, case 1054).<br>
<br>In person Maginn was invariably in good temper, would break into a tune in the middle of conversation, and enjoyed the company of coal-heavers and navvies over that of lords and swells. He was grey-haired by his late twenties, though otherwise youthful in appearance, and when too drunk to walk could get home by breaking into a brisk jog. He was apparently never too drunk to write. Friends commented on his remarkable lack of personal rancour towards the political opponents and literary figures he &#145;squabashed&#146;, and on his extraordinary memory and ability to write accurately and well while carrying on a conversation on a different topic. Even when sick and in the Fleet he impressed Richard Oastler, the <span class="roman">Factory Act</span> campaigner, with his witty conversation, cheerfulness, and radical tory politics. As Thackeray noted, however, for the Victorians he was chiefly &#145;a famous subject for moralizing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2. 140&#150;41).<br>
<br>Maginn's final attempt at fiction was <span class="italic">John Manesty, Liverpool Merchant</span>, completed by Charles Ollier and published posthumously (1844). He had frequently been urged to collect his best articles in more permanent form. But when he did so, the project was under-capitalized and under-puffed, so a publication in parts called <span class="italic">Magazine Miscellanies</span> (1841) went mostly unpurchased. With its failure he was sued, and once again lodged in the Fleet prison, where his tuberculosis accelerated. After release on humanitarian grounds, Maginn was reluctantly induced to take advantage of the <span class="roman">Insolvent Debtor's Act</span> (18 June 1842). Lacking the funds to travel to the warmer climate his doctors recommended, the Maginns went instead to a little village in Surrey. On 11 August 1842 he wrote to his old Cork friend, Crofton Croker: &#145;Here I am at Walton-on-Thames, coughing my heart up. The doctors think I am going to die&#146;  (Thrall, 205). In the wee hours of Sunday morning, 21 August, the doctors were proved correct, and he died in an upstairs room at Cypress Lodge surrounded by his family. He was buried on 29 August in a pauper's grave in the churchyard of the church of St Mary, Walton-on-Thames; during the service and interment remarkable peals of thunder rang out from a clear blue sky.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>Maginn remains important to historians of the press, especially for his role in <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, but he is chiefly remembered for his work in <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> and <span class="italic">Fraser's</span>, where for over twenty years he stirred the pot with learned, witty, and frequently scurrilous essays, reviews, parodies, burlesques, and pasquinades, almost all anonymous or pseudonymous. Politically he supported only the tories; later accusations that he wrote for both whigs and tories are not true, and seem to have arisen from his own satire of such newspapermen in &#145;The Tobias correspondence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, 1840). He brought a unique sensibility to this work: tory, but allergic to any form of aristocratic pretension; proudly Irish, but strongly pro-Union and protestant; anti-bourgeois and a champion of the labourers, because convinced the working classes were naturally conservative; and deeply learned, though rarely pedantic. His debts seem to have accrued through the daily accumulation of not knowing how to say no, and his house was open to any Corkman who found the door. Kenealy, however, believed that the extravagance of Ellen Maginn contributed to his ruin.<br>
<br>Maginn would no doubt be better known if he had spent his critical forces and formidable powers of ridicule on Carlyle, Tennyson, Browning, Dickens, and Thackeray, instead of working with them or praising their work. After all, his friend Lockhart&#151;who wrote a famous epitaph on &#145;bright, broken Maginn&#146;&#151;is now chiefly remembered for ridiculing Keats and the cockney school. Instead, while the Victorians disowned this brilliant though dissolute Corkman, his unsparing assault on the dominant mediocrities popular in the 1830s helped clear the ground for the greater literature to come.<br>
