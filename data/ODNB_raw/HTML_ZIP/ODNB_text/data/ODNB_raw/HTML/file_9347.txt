<span class="headword">Fermor <span class="st"> [Farmer]</span>, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1621&#150;1661), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was born at Cokayne House, Old Broad Street, London, and baptized on 7 November 1621 at St Peter-le-Poer, London, the eldest son of Sir Hatton Fermor (<i>c</i>.1580&#150;1640), landowner of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, and his second wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5824/', "Sir William Cokayne")</script> of Rushton, Northamptonshire, and sister of Charles, first Viscount Cullen. He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford in 1636 but did not take a degree. When Sir Hatton Fermor died in 1640 Lady Fermor successfully applied for wardship of her son. William was created a baronet on 6 September 1641 by the king, who also gave him the command of a troop of horse, and afterwards made him a privy councillor to Prince Charles.<br>
<br>Fermor was appointed a commissioner of array for Northamptonshire in 1642, but was omitted from the revised 1643 list. He was a cavalry captain at the battle of Edgehill in October 1642 and although he later told parliamentarian authorities that he had served for six months only he was still in the royalist cavalry in 1645.<br>
<br>Fermor lived modestly at Easton Neston after the first civil war. He compounded for &pound;1400 for his estates in August 1646, being allowed, however, to collect his rents provided he paid them in to the government's use. He married, on 8 September 1646 at North Luffenham, Rutland, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 25 March 1628, <i>d</i>. 1670), daughter of Hugh Perry, alias Hunter, of London, and widow of Henry Noel, second son of Viscount Campden. Mary brought him an estate of &pound;300 in Rutland. They had six sons and two daughters. In 1651 the authorities discovered the Rutland estate and compelled Fermor to compound for it. In 1653 Fermor may have been suspected of royalist activity, being summoned, with the royalist Sir Charles Compton before the council. In a rather obscure incident in 1654 two Northamptonshire men, John Digby and John Willoughby, it seems separately, came into conflict with Fermor. Digby and Fermor were prevented by the council of state from fighting a duel, Willoughby was found to have distributed libellous papers against Fermor and was sent to the Tower, and both Digby and Willoughby were ordered to apologize to Fermor. Fermor was commended for his behaviour &#145;as a man of honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1654</i>, 224). In the tense atmosphere of 1655 Fermor, among others, was charged with assembling riotously, destroying the protector's deer, and encouraging poaching, but, though summoned again before the council, no punishment is recorded. He was listed in 1658 as a Northamptonshire royalist without military rank. A Major Farmer was sent in 1659 with a troop of horse on a failed mission to secure Carlisle for General Monck.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Fermor's fortunes, for a short time, revived. In May 1660 he took his seat on the privy council. On 2 April 1661 he was involved in a double return for the parliamentary seat of Brackley, Northamptonshire. He was also deputy lieutenant for the county. He was created a knight of the Bath on 18 April, and on the 23rd took part in the coronation, his last appearance in public. He was too ill to petition for his seat in the Cavalier Parliament and died on 14 May in the company of his mother at the house of Mr Hill a tailor, at the Sign of the Lyons Head in Covent Garden, London. Collins claims he died of smallpox caught during the coronation ceremonies, though there seems no contemporary evidence for this. He was buried on 22 May at Easton Neston. In his will he entrusted the management of his estate to his wife (who died on 18 July 1670), and mother. His heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9348/', "William Fermor")</script>, became Baron Leominster in 1692. His younger sons received &pound;2500 each, and his daughters &pound;400 each per annum.<br>
