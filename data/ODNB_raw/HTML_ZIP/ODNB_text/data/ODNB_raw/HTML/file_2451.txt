<span class="headword">Bird,  Samuel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1603), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Samuel Bird of Walden, Essex. He matriculated as a pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, at Easter 1566, graduated BA in 1569&#150;70, and commenced MA from Corpus Christi College in 1573. In November 1573 he was elected a fellow of Corpus Christi and was admitted on 30 April following. He vacated his fellowship in 1576 and disappears from the historical record until May 1592 when he became minister of St Peter's, Ipswich, where he remained until his death in 1603. Suggestions that in the sixteen-year interim Bird was employed as a schoolmaster, in either London or Suffolk, probably result from confusion with namesakes.<br>
<br>What is clear is that, not later than 1580, Bird had experienced a conversion to a godly way of life. The evidence for this appears in his first published work, <span class="italic">A friendlie communication or dialogue betweene Paule and Demas wherein is disputed how we are to use the pleasures of this life</span> (1580), which contains a particularly strong attack upon the perils of playing cards and dice. In the preliminary &#145;Epistle to the Christian Reader&#146; Bird confesses that he had &#145;grieved good hearts in following foolish games&#146; and that &#145;it shall make more for the glorie of God, and more against this sinne, when it is cried out uppon, of him that hath had his delight therein&#146;. The work is notable for a number of references to his time in Cambridge but gives little information as to Bird's circumstances in 1580, describing him simply on the title-page as &#145;Master of Art and fellow not long since of Benet Colledge&#146;, the name by which Corpus Christi was familiarly known. He speaks of having been granted &#145;so great leasure&#146;, and incidental references make it clear that he resided in a town either in Essex or Suffolk. Little is known of his ministry at St Peter's, Ipswich. When Bishop William Redman went on visitation in 1597, the churchwardens disclosed a catalogue of nonconformist offences: Bird did not wear the surplice, omitted the sign of the cross in baptism, permitted fathers to answer for the child in baptism, did not bid holy days and fast days, and did not perambulate. He preached on Tuesdays and Sundays but &#145;whether licensed or noe they knowe not&#146;  (Williams, 157&#150;8). His punishment was reserved but his practice was matched by that of his colleagues in other Ipswich parishes at this time.<br>
<br>Both <span class="italic">The lectures of Samuel Bird of Ipswidge upon the 8 and 9 chapters of the second epistle to the Corinthians</span> and <span class="italic">The lectures of Samuel Bird of Ipswidge upon the 11 chapter of the epistle unto the Hebrewes and upon the 38 Psalme</span> were published in Cambridge by John Legate in 1598, having been prepared for the press in the autumn of 1597. The first work, a treatise on generosity, provides evidence of Bird's close association with John Moore of Ipswich, an influential and godly alderman. The second was dedicated with praise to Edward Bacon of Shrubland Hall, describing him in the dedicatory epistle as one who had learned &#145;not to spende your witte and your studies and your revenewes upon haukes and dogges and gawdish apparell&#146;, accounting &#145;the rebuke of Christ greater riches then to enjoy the delights of sinne for a season&#146;. Both are works of scriptural exposition in a plain style laced with pungent sayings and illustrations, and may have begun life as parish sermons or in the context of a combination lecture.<br>
<br>Bird married at least twice and had five sons, Samuel, Josias, Joseph, Nathaniell, and Jonathan, and four daughters, Dorothie, Elizabeth, Sara, and Marie. His will makes mention of four stepdaughters from a later marriage. His son Samuel received an exhibition scholarship from the corporation of Ipswich to pursue his studies at Cambridge. Bird's stipend at St Peter's was a respectable &pound;30 per annum and at his death he possessed land and a butcher's shop in Ipswich as well as a house in Haddenham. When he came to write his will on 26 July 1603, in the context of an outbreak of &#145;generall plauge and mortallitie&#146; in and near Ipswich, his sole bequest was both personal and warmly evangelical. He had died by 30 November, when his will was granted probate.<br>
