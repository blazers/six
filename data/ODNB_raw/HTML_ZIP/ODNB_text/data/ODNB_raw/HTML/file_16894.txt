<span class="headword">Locker,  John</span>  (1693&#150;1760), <span class="occ">barrister and literary editor</span>, was born in London on 27 August 1693, the eldest son of Stephen Locker, one-time clerk to the Leathersellers' Company. On 12 March 1707 John was admitted to the Merchant Taylors' School, London, from the Mercers' School. He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 21 April 1711, stayed at Oxford for about two years, and entered Gray's Inn on 28 March 1719. He was called to the bar in 1724. He was a commissioner of bankruptcy and became clerk of the Leathersellers' Company on 2 June 1719 and of the Clockmakers' Company in 1740. He entered into membership of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 3 March 1737 and became a friend of a fellow member, William Bowyer, the learned printer.<br>
<br>Locker married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1759), the eldest daughter of Edward Stillingfleet, rector of Wood Norton and Swanton in Norfolk and sister of the naturalist Benjamin Stillingfleet. Elizabeth and John Locker had nine children. Their second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16895/', "William Locker")</script>, Nelson's teacher, became lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital, Kent.<br>
<br>Dr Johnson described Locker as &#145;a gentleman eminent for curiosity and literature&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.372&#150;3). Some of his poems were published in <span class="italic">The Constellation: Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1715), a miscellany of short pastorals, satires, and odes, and a translation of Virgil's first eclogue; he also translated into English part of Voltaire's history of Charles XII, which was published in 1732 as the <span class="italic">History of Charles XII of Sweden</span>. He was also renowned for his skill in Greek, particularly modern Greek, which he is reputed to have acquired from a poor Greek priest found wandering lost in the streets of London. Locker took him to his house and maintained him for some years in return for which the priest provided instruction in the Greek language.<br>
<br>The most notable of Locker's achievements, however, was the work he undertook with Robert Stephens, historiographer royal, on the manuscript letters of Sir Francis Bacon. When Stephens died in November 1732 his papers passed to Locker who prepared them for the press adding, in accordance with Stephens's direction, &#145;what else he thought fit from his Collection of Manuscripts which was more than he [Stephens] had intended at that time&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4260, fol. 19<i>v</i>). This edition of Bacon's correspondence was published by Locker's friend Bowyer in 1734. Locker also made corrections to the fourth volume of John Blackbourne's edition of Bacon's works. These corrections, in Locker's hand, are extant in the copy of this volume housed in the British Library.<br>
<br>Locker died in London on 30 May 1760 and was buried at St Helen, Bishopsgate, London. His collection of manuscripts was purchased by Thomas Birch in 1764  (BL, Add. MSS 4108 and 4258&#150;4262).<br>
