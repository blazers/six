<span class="headword">Rogers,  Zebedee</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1774, <em>d.</em> 1833), <span class="occ">missionary to seafarers and shoemaker</span>, was baptized at Strood, Kent, on 10 April 1774, the son of John and Elizabeth Rogers. He is recognized as the originator of the historic seafarers' emblem known as the Bethel flag. His given name (that of the father of the seafaring apostles James and John) has frequently but erroneously been rendered as Zebulon (the &#145;maritime&#146; tribe of ancient Israel), and even Zecharaiah (the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophet).<br>
<br>Rogers, is recorded as having been a freeman of Rochester, Kent, on 19 October 1795, by apprenticeship to John Rogers, almost certainly his father, as a cordwainer. While this may indicate Rochester as Rogers's birthplace the township of Rotherhithe, on the south bank of the Lower Pool of the River Thames, eventually became his home. Here, when quite young, he would frequently accompany his father, who was then employed as a coal measurer, when visiting the tiers of north country collier brigs waiting to unload along that part of the river. In later years Rogers would recall his powerful early impressions of the incredibly hard life to which seafarers of that day were regularly exposed.<br>
<br>Having established himself as a local shoemaker, Rogers became an active member of the Wesleyan Methodist chapel in Silver Street, Rotherhithe. Here, at the close of a service, he noticed and befriended a lone, visibly distressed, seafaring visitor, a Captain David Simpson, master of the collier brig <i>Friendship</i> of Shields. On being invited on board Rogers received permission from the captain to welcome the crew into the cabin and let him &#145;pray with them&#146;. Incredulous at such a novel notion, they all complied.<br>
<br>The day when that first informal grass-roots Christian community was created on the waters of the Thames, 22 June 1814, would later be remembered as the day the mustard seed of a worldwide missionary movement was sown. In fact, the enthusiastic response of that original collier crew became a catalyst for fellowship meetings for prayer, hymn singing, and <span class="roman">Bible</span> study on other colliers, too, soon to be led by both captains and colleagues of Rogers from his Rotherhithe chapel, notably a timber merchant, Samuel Jennings.<br>
<br>Although these lay-led mariners' meetings multiplied steadily along the Lower Pool from 1814 to 1817, it took another radical innovation, again attributable to Rogers, to transform an essentially local Methodist manifestation into a global phenomenon which transcended denominational demarcations. It sprang from the mounting need for an effective means of communication among those tiers of colliers on the Thames that would serve the dual purpose of identifying a host ship and inviting fellow seafarers in the vicinity to informal worship and <span class="roman">Bible</span> study aboard her. While pondering this problem Rogers envisaged a maritime emblem displaying the word &#145;Bethel&#146; in white letters on a blue ground.<br>
<br>Amazed on learning the word's biblical significance as a &#145;house of God&#146;  (<span class="roman">Genesis</span> 28: 17&#150;19), Rogers had seafaring comrades collect for the bunting and cut out the letters, leaving it to his sister to sew the signal together. The master of the nearby collier brig <i>Zephyr</i>, Captain T. Hindhulph of South Shields, also a Methodist, readily agreed to have this first Bethel flag flown from his main masthead on 23 March 1817.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards, it became clear that a second flag was needed. But this time two further features were added: the five-pointed Star of Bethlehem at the top of the hoist and Noah's olive-branch carrying dove of peace at the base, in addition to the word Bethel across the centre. Thus symbolizing the three major events in the life of Jesus Christ, celebrated at Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost respectively, this version was destined to predominate, as demand for the banner began to burgeon. In fact, the effect was nothing short of electric. After centuries of segregation and near neglect by church and society, seafarers had finally found a biblical banner by which they could relate to both, and which they could instinctively recognize as their own.<br>
<br>Within a decade hundreds of Bethel captains, as they came to be called, had carried the flag worldwide, together with shipboard cell groups or &#145;base communities&#146;, reminiscent of the contagious house-church movement recorded in the book of <span class="roman">Acts</span>. The emblem also became a catalyst for maritime mission facilities ashore, appropriately called Bethels. A key factor in this whole so-called Bethel movement was the pioneer role of Zebedee Rogers; and no one was more insistent about this than the Revd George Charles Smith, founder of the entire seafarers' mission movement, in the dawn of which the Bethel movement was to play such a pivotal part.<br>
<br>Rogers remained one of Smith's closest collaborators for the rest of his life, constantly co-ordinating Bethel meetings on the Thames, at first voluntarily, then, from the 1820s, as the zealous employee of early seafarers' mission societies with which Smith was intimately associated. On shore he conducted an innovative and remarkably successful campaign of sailor-town evangelism and social action, both in the notorious Screw Bay area of Rotherhithe, and then across the river in Stepney, Shadwell, and Wapping. As co-workers he enlisted teams of intrepid volunteers among seafarers in port, aptly known as Bethel press gangs. His last years he served as superintendent of a rudimentary shelter for destitute seafarers called the Sailors' Rest, founded by Smith in 1830 and located in Cannon Street Road, Stepney.<br>
<br>It was also the Smith who preached the funeral oration on Rogers's death in 1833. Rogers's body was brought to Smith's London Mariners' Church in Wellclose Square, and in Smith's own words &#145;buried with all the Bethel flags and honours that grateful hearts could procure, amidst a host of spectators&#146;. Actual interment, he later wrote, took place in the ground behind &#145;the large chapel&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Sailor's Magazine</span>, 1855, 230) in nearby Cannon Street Road.<br>
