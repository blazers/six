<span class="headword">Gospatric</span>, second earl of Lothian  (<em>d.</em> 1166), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50322/', "Gospatric, first earl of Lothian")</script> and lord of Beanley, who was probably killed at the battle of the Standard in 1138. There is little record of his life. He was the eldest son, and appears as a witness to one of his father's grants to Coldingham some time before 1138. On his father's demise, Gospatric, who was old enough to be the father of a son handed over as a hostage to King Stephen in 1139, succeeded to both the earldom of Lothian and the serjeanty of Beanley, making him, like his father, a cross-border landholder of considerable note. His seal styles him &#145;earl of Lothian&#146;, although he is simply referred to as &#145;Earl Gospatric&#146; in charters which he granted or attested.<br>
<br>Gospatric's activities in Northumberland are poorly documented. In 1161 he rendered 12 marks for six knights' fees to the English exchequer, suggesting that the service of &#145;inborh and utborh&#146;, which his father had owed for the serjeanty of Beanley, had been commuted, at least in part, to knights' fees. Unlike his father, who was active in both Northumberland and Scotland, Gospatric's chief interests appear to have lain north of the border&#151;or this is the impression left by the surviving documentation, for Gospatric was a frequent witness to the acts of King Malcolm IV. This northern focus may have been the result of his father's generous support for Gospatric's younger brothers.<br>
<br>In his role as a benefactor of the church, Gospatric also contrasts with his father. Not only was he a patron of the abbeys of Melrose and Kelso and the priory of Coldingham, but he also jointly founded, along with his wife, a Cistercian nunnery at Coldstream, probably in the later years of his life. He may also have founded the nunnery at Eccles, although the evidence for his involvement is uncertain. The chronicler Reginald of Durham relates an anecdote which reflects favourably upon the character of Gospatric. He records how one of Gospatric's tenants at Dunbar was a poor man afflicted with an incurable and agonizing disease. Reginald then describes how, out of his own goodwill and respect for the good works of this man, Gospatric allowed him to live on his lands free of any burdens for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Gospatric married a woman named Derder (Deirdre), whose name was Gaelic, although nothing further is known of her ancestry. Their children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50325/', "Waltheof (or Waldeve)")</script> and Patrick. The <span class="italic">Chronicle of Melrose</span> records under the year 1166 the death of Earl Gospatric and the succession of his son Waltheof. One of the greatest difficulties surrounding Gospatric remains the place of his burial. In 1821 a covering stone for a sarcophagus, bearing the inscription, in Latin, &#145;Earl Gospatric&#146; was discovered at Durham. Although this slab is usually said to be that of the earl of Northumbria who was driven out in 1072, it is almost certain that he was buried at Norham. On stylistic grounds, moreover, the slab belongs to the latter half of the twelfth century rather than the late eleventh, and is therefore more likely to mark the resting place of the Gospatric who died in 1166. That Gospatric may have ended his days at Durham is further suggested both by the favourable attitude of Reginald of Durham towards him, and by an obituary in the Durham <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>, which records the name of &#145;Gospatrick, earl and monk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>, 147). The identification of Durham as the burial place of Gospatric cannot be regarded as certain, however, for an alternative tradition records that, along with his wife, he was buried in the nunnery at Eccles which they may have founded.<br>
