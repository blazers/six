</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gardner, Dame  Helen Louise</span>  (1908&#150;1986), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born at Brookfield, Dukes Avenue, Church End, Finchley, Middlesex, on 13 February 1908, the middle child and only daughter of Charles Henry Gardner (1867&#150;1919), journalist, and his wife, Helen Mary Roadknight, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cockman (1877&#150;1967), daughter of Charles Roadknight Cockman, schoolmaster. Helen was eleven when her father died and the family thereafter made their home with her grandparents. Mrs Gardner, a very musical woman, was ambitious for her gifted daughter and her encouragement was stimulating and sometimes a strain. Helen's education was at the North London Collegiate School for Girls, where she benefited from the excellent teaching of her English mistress, Florence Gibbons. In 1926 she went to St Hilda's College, Oxford, and in 1929 obtained first-class honours in English language and literature. Amateur dramatics revealed talents that could be discerned later in her style of lecturing and lively conversational habits.<br>
<br>Helen Gardner accepted a temporary post at the University of Birmingham. After three years (1931&#150;4) as an assistant lecturer at the Royal Holloway College, London, she seized the chance of returning to Birmingham, as a member of the English department (1934&#150;41). She extended the scope of her lecturing beyond the university audience; canvassed for Labour in a Conservative area; agonized over the Spanish Civil War and refugees from Nazi Germany. It was on a dreary March day in 1940 that her spirits were roused by a first contact with T. S. Eliot's &#145;East Coker&#146;. In 1941 she sought and took good advice and left Birmingham for Oxford to become a tutor (1941&#150;54), and later fellow (1942&#150;66), at her old college. The next thirteen years she regarded as her &#145;golden years&#146;. She was memorably steady in her concern for the welfare of her own pupils. To the less able her tutorials were formidable, but to those who could take the wit and severity of her criticism of their essays the experience proved rewarding. In 1954 she was made reader in Renaissance studies and after one set-back was elected in 1966 Merton professor of English language and literature, with a fellowship at Lady Margaret Hall. The distinction of being the first woman to hold this chair gave her special satisfaction. She exerted herself as a supervisor and was as successful as she was strict. Forewords in many publications bear witness to her influence. From 1961 to 1963 she served on the committee on higher education chaired by Baron Robbins. She relished the discussion and travel involved and remained unabashed by some of the criticism of the extent of university expansion which was recommended. She served on the Council for National Academic Awards (1964&#150;7) and enjoyed being a trustee for the National Portrait Gallery (1967&#150;78). As a delegate to the Oxford University Press (1959&#150;75) she made herself felt to the benefit of English studies. On subjects outside her range her judgements were sometimes less happy.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Helen Gardner's work on the two poets with whom she will chiefly be associated&#151;John Donne and T. S. Eliot&#151;went on concurrently. Her masterly edition of Donne's <span class="italic">Divine Poems</span> appeared in 1952 and was revised in 1978. The parallel edition of his <span class="italic">Elegies and Songs and Sonnets</span> followed in 1965. It was her declared intent to supersede Herbert Grierson's text, believing that she had the advantage of more manuscripts to subject to the rigorous method of collation she favoured. The introductions and commentaries manifest the industry and intelligence she brought to this work. Against subsequent criticism she continued to defend the readings and reorderings she proposed.<br>
<br>Helen Gardner's tribute to the genius of T. S. Eliot took a different form. In <span class="italic">The Art of T. S. Eliot</span> (1949) she provided a way into an originality in thought and prosody in the poems which both fascinated and perplexed many readers. It was gratifying for her to learn that she had her author's approval. This book was written <i>con amore</i> and shows to advantage her critical enthusiasm. Later, in 1978, she drew on her knowledge of the drafts of <span class="italic">Four Quartets</span>, which she had seen in 1947, to demonstrate a poem in the making (<span class="italic">The Composition of &#145;Four Quartets&#146;</span>, 1978). She also wrote on Shakespeare and on Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. The British Academy lectures on Othello (&#145;The noble Moor&#146;, 1955) and on King Lear (1967) draw out her best. The introductions to the <span class="roman">World's Classics</span> selections of metaphysical poets (1961) and of George Herbert are admirable. She collaborated with Timothy Healy in selecting from Donne's sermons (<span class="italic">Selected Prose</span>, 1967), and with G. M. Story in an edition of William Alabaster's poems (1959).<br>
<br>The popularity of Helen Gardner as a lecturer in Britain, the United States, European capitals, and the Far East owed as much to her style as to her subject. Her enthusiasm could be infectious. She had a clear, strong voice and was aware of its attraction. The phrasing and rhythms of her prose echo in some measure their oral delivery. Her favourite unit of composition was about the length of a lecture, essay, long obituary, or university sermon. Criticism she regarded as a serving art. She was not an innovator but chose rather to consolidate and conserve. Her endeavour was to increase the understanding and enjoyment of the best to be found in the literature of her own language. Later in life she was dismayed to realize how strong was the current of new methods of analysis, in the valuation of poetry and the style of theatrical production, and the effect it had on the teaching of English. She advertised her disapproval with fierce irony and then in more positive chapters reasserted her own beliefs in <span class="italic">In Defence of the Imagination</span> (1982). As a reviewer she was thorough, conscientious, severe, and open: everything was signed. She dealt with many of the most important publications of her peers and risked making enemies in the process. Twice she took on the thankless task of an anthologist with good will. The <span class="italic">Faber Book of Religious Verse</span> (1972) was followed in the same year by a more ambitious undertaking, The <span class="italic">New Oxford Book of English Verse</span>. To her Oxford DLitt (1963) and Cambridge honorary LittD (1981) she added honorary degrees from eight other universities. She was appointed CBE in 1962 and a DBE in 1967. She was made a fellow of the British Academy in 1958, twice won the Crawshay prize (1952 and 1980), and was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1962.<br>
<br>In person Helen Gardner was small and sturdy. Vivacious, temperamental, and occasionally overbearing, she appreciated good food and drink, liked to dress well, and revelled in parties where she talked well but, as she herself knew, too much. She was kinder in her actions than in her wit. No feminist, she liked to be a woman in a man's world, game to compete and reckoning that she could match anyone for scholarly hard work and tough argument. She made no secret of her satisfaction in her success. She was brave in a number of illnesses and limped a little after a repeated hip replacement. She was a devout Anglican in the tradition of the seventeenth-century divines. Retirement at Myrtle House, 12 Mill Street, Eynsham, near Oxford, in 1975 did not greatly change her way of working except that she had more time to give to her pleasure in gardens and foreign travel. She died, unmarried, on 4 June 1986 in a nursing home at Bicester, Oxfordshire, after many months of a distressing illness.<br>
