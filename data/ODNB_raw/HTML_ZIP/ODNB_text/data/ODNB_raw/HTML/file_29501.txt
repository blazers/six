<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Edward Vaughan</span>  (1797&#150;1875), <span class="occ">judge and legal writer</span>, was born at Queen Square, Bayswater, London, the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29518/', "John Williams (1757&#150;1810)")</script>, serjeant-at-law, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Charles Clarke of Foribridge near Stafford. Educated at Winchester College from 1808, he moved to Westminster School in 1811. An able classicist, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1816, and was elected a scholar in the following year. He graduated BA in 1820 and MA in 1823.<br>
<br>On leaving Cambridge, Williams entered Lincoln's Inn on 22 June 1818, and read successively in the chambers of John Patteson and John Campbell. He was called to the bar on 17 June 1823. He initially joined the Oxford circuit where he soon found work, but joined the south Wales circuit when it became independent and travelled also on the Chester circuit.<br>
<br>On 5 September 1826 Williams married Jane Margaret, eighth daughter of the Revd Walter Bagot, brother of the first Lord Bagot of Blithfield, Staffordshire. They had six sons, the fifth of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36928/', "Sir Roland Vaughan Williams")</script>, became a lord justice of appeal in 1897.<br>
<br>In 1824 with John Patteson, Williams edited the fifth edition of <span class="italic">Williams' Saunders</span>, his father's notes to Saunders's reports. This established his reputation as a lawyer, and he produced two further editions in 1845 and 1871. Saunders's reports were not methodically arranged, and subsequent editions with notes, though deeply learned, were no more orderly than the original. Very different was Williams's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Law of Executors and Administrators</span> published in 1832. Described by Joseph Chitty in his <span class="italic">Practice of the Law</span> (2nd edn, 1834, 1.511) as &#145;one of the most able and correct works that have ever been published on any legal subject&#146;, it went through seven editions in the author's lifetime, and reached its seventeenth edition in 1993 in the form of <span class="italic">Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate</span>. In addition to his two major works, Williams edited Richard Burn's <span class="italic">Justice of the Peace</span> with Thomas D'Oyley (1836), and contributed a chapter on evidence to William Russell's treatise on crimes.<br>
<br>Having served an apprenticeship as recorder of Kidwelly, Williams was created serjeant-at-law on 27 October 1846 and on the same day appointed a justice of the court of common pleas. He was knighted on 4 February 1847. Sitting <i>in banco</i> at Westminster he was acknowledged to be one of the most powerful constituents of the court, and because of his deep learning and common sense probably gave rise to fewer new trials on the ground of misdirection than any of his fellow judges. His judgments were cautious, concise, and extremely accurate, although he was perhaps too cautious, in his books in particular, allowing doubtful points to remain unresolved which his authority might otherwise have settled. Williams was compelled by increasing deafness to retire from the bench in February 1865. On his retirement he was sworn of the privy council and gave valuable assistance on its judicial committee between 1865 and 1868.<br>
<br>Despite his learning Williams's modesty stood in the way of his general reputation. His choice of words was fastidious and his speech somewhat laboured and embarrassed, but he was a fine scholar and man of letters, with refined and cultivated tastes. At Westminster he spent much time in the company of Henry Milman, William Buckland, Richard Trench, and Henry Liddell. He died on 2 November 1875 at his home, 24 Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, and was buried at Wotton near Dorking.<br>
