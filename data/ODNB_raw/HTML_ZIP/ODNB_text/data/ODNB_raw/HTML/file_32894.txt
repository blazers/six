<span class="headword">Dreyer,  Georges</span>  (1873&#150;1934), <span class="occ">pathologist</span>, was born at Shanghai on 4 July 1873, the second son and third and youngest child of Captain Georg Hannibal Napoleon Dreyer, of the Royal Danish Navy, and his wife, Dagmar Alvilde, daughter of Judge W. T. Qvistgaard, a well-known jurist of Fredensborg. They lived in Copenhagen, but at the time of Dreyer's birth his father was in Shanghai as diplomatic adviser to the Great Northern Cable Company. Dreyer went to the Borgerdydsskolen at Christianshavn, then to the University of Copenhagen, where he graduated MD in 1900. His unusually rich education in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and periods of postgraduate research in Denmark, Germany, and England under Carl Julius Salomonsen, Niels Ryberg Finsen, Albert Neisser, and Sir J. Burdon Sanderson, gave him a command of languages and supremely fitted him for a scientific career. He married, in 1900, Margrete Caroline, daughter of Laurits J&ouml;rgersen, of S&ouml;llestedgaard Manor, Laaland, Denmark, who survived him. There were no children.<br>
<br>Dreyer's first appointment as demonstrator of pathology in the University of Copenhagen combined research with arduous routine. In collaboration with Thorvald Madsen he contributed to the knowledge of diphtheria toxin and anti-toxin, and studied the effects of ultraviolet radiations on micro-organisms. From the beginning a passionate precision of technique and a loathing of slipshod thought characterized all his work, and it was in the accurate quantitative measurement of biological processes that he made many of his most notable contributions to science.<br>
<br>Appointed in 1907, when only thirty-four, to the chair of pathology at Oxford, which he held until his death, Dreyer revolutionized the teaching, and by his vivid personality, enthusiasm, and learning attracted a steady succession of collaborators. Among the varied fields of research pursued in his department were the principle and practice of the serological diagnosis of intestinal infections; quantitative studies of blood volume, the size of the aorta, vital capacity, and their relations to height and weight; the calculation of the dosage of toxins and drugs according to the surface area of the individual; inoculation against typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, and its effects on the Widal reaction; and methods of serological diagnosis in syphilis.<br>
<br>Dreyer was naturalized in 1912. During the First World War he was appointed to the pathological advisory committee where he pressed for triple inoculation in the place of typhoid inoculation only. He was commissioned in the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1915 and sent to Wimereux to organize the laboratory diagnosis of enteric fever and dysentery. In the course of this project he instituted, in 1915, the standards laboratory at Oxford which for the next thirty years provided this country and the dominions with scientifically standardized reagents for serological diagnosis. Later came investigations on the quantitative estimation of tuberculin, on variations in the virulence of the tubercle bacillus, and on the preparation and use of immunizing reagents against tuberculosis. His field test of the latter in Danish cattle did not, however, live up to its early promise.<br>
<br>Although in his later years he paid increasing attention to university business and to the building of the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, which is his monument, Dreyer could not be parted from his own research, which in this period turned to the action of radiations on bacteria (a revival of an earlier interest) and the devising of quantitative methods for the estimation of bacteriophage potency.<br>
<br>Dreyer was elected a member of the Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab in 1909, and in 1913 received the French order of Officier de l'Instruction Publique. For his war work on the oxygen supply to aircrews and on the diagnosis of enteric fever he was appointed CBE in 1919, and he was elected FRS in 1921.<br>
<br>In 1912 Dreyer was elected a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, which profited greatly from his interest and wise counsels. He served for many years on the hebdomadal council where his unusual power of understanding the points at issue, shown in university, college, and scientific matters, caused his opinions and judgement to command respect. He died suddenly while on holiday at S&ouml;llestedgaard on 17 August 1934.<br>
