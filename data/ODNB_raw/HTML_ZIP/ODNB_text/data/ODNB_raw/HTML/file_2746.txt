<span class="headword">Bocking,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1534), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, may have been a relation of the Bocking family settled at Ash Bocking, Suffolk. The church there was appropriated to Canterbury Cathedral priory, where Edward was professed a monk in 1500. In 1504 he was admitted a scholar to Canterbury College, Oxford, where he became warden in 1510. In 1512 he supplicated for the degree of BTh, to which he was admitted on 16 June 1513. He proceeded DTh in June 1518 and resigned his wardenship in the same year, a step doubtless accounted for by his becoming cellarer at Canterbury, also in 1518. In 1526 he was a member of the commission appointed by Archbishop William Warham to investigate the divine revelations allegedly received by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1598/', "Elizabeth Barton")</script>, a servant of Thomas Cobb, the steward of the archiepiscopal manor of Aldington, Kent. The commissioners judged Barton to be genuinely inspired. Soon afterwards she left Aldington to become a nun of St Sepulchre's, Canterbury, and Bocking became her confessor and spiritual adviser.<br>
<br>By October 1528 Barton had turned to politics, agitating against Henry VIII's plan to annul his marriage to Katherine of Aragon, and from the beginning of these activities Bocking was her closest confidant. His most important role, however, was as a publicist for Barton. He was often accused, both by Henry VIII's government and by later historians, of having concocted rather than merely disseminated her revelations. It is impossible to tell whether there is substance in the charge but it has the appearance of misogyny, and certainly the government benefited greatly by using it to undermine the commonplace assumption that Barton's revelations must have been holy because a woman could not normally have had the wits to invent them on her own.<br>
<br>Bocking is known to have spread word of Barton's vision that Henry VIII would lose his crown if he married Anne Boleyn, describing the vision in person to the prior of Leeds, the prior of Monks Horton, and a number of priests and merchants in Kent. He also wrote in his own hand a &#145;great book&#146; of Barton's revelations, a compendium of her visions that later became the principal evidence on which Barton and her associates were attainted of treason; on several occasions he is known to have lent out portions of this manuscript, one quire at a time, for scribal reproduction. In 1533 a fair copy of Bocking's manuscript was made by Thomas Laurence of Canterbury, and 700 copies of the book were issued by the printer John Skot, who supplied 500 copies to Bocking. The government's crackdown on the Barton circle prevented distribution of the book, however, and all copies were apparently confiscated and destroyed; none exists today. There does survive in Bocking's hand a single-page manuscript entitled <span class="italic">Elizabethae virginis spiritualis gratiae libri secundi prologus</span>, which may have been part of another book about Barton (TNA: PRO, SP 1/80, fol. 140).<br>
<br>Bocking had been arrested by 25 September 1533 and was imprisoned in the Tower. Denounced for his involvement with Barton he was among her associates who shared her public penance and humiliation first at Paul's Cross on 23 November and then in Canterbury on 7 December. Sent back to the Tower at the end of March 1534 he was attainted of treason under the statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 12, and hanged at Tyburn on 20 April along with Barton herself and four other of her associates. His head was set on one of the city gates, but his other remains were interred in the cemetery of the London Blackfriars. These deaths were the first Catholic &#145;martyrdoms&#146; of the English Reformation. The most detailed sources for Bocking's career&#151;the act of attainder and the Paul's Cross sermon preached against Barton on 23 November 1533&#151;were composed as propaganda by Bocking's enemies in an effort to discredit him and his allies. These sources have in the past been taken at face value by many scholars, who have thus suggested that Bocking encouraged Barton to fake her revelations, that he coerced her into opposing the crown, and that the two were sexual partners. Such stories are almost certainly slanderous, and letters written to Bocking in the early 1530s suggest that he was widely respected by his associates not only for his principled opposition to the royal divorce but also for his holiness.<br>
