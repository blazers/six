<span class="headword">Amery,  John</span>  (1912&#150;1945), <span class="occ">traitor</span>, was born on 14 March 1912 at 9 Embankment Gardens, Chelsea, London, the elder son (there were no daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30401/', "Leopold Charles Maurice Stennett Amery (1873&#150;1955)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Florence Louise Adeliza 
    (Bryddie; 1885&#150;1975)
  , daughter of John Hamar Greenwood of Whitby, Ontario, and sister of (Thomas) Hamar (first Viscount) Greenwood. At sixteen he ran away from Harrow School, and set up as a film director, work which took him to central Europe and east Africa, but proved financially unrewarding. It combined ill with his taste for fast cars and high life; in 1936 he was declared bankrupt, and settled with his family that he had better live abroad. Two years earlier, experiences in Vienna on the verge of civil war had awakened in him vehement, if premature, anti-communism. Accordingly, he went to Spain when civil war broke out there in July 1936 to take an active part on the insurgent General Franco's side, smuggling arms across the Pyrenees and receiving the Italian medal for valour in action. In 1939 bad health drove him to a sanatorium in French Savoy.<br>
<br>Amery's first marriage (in Athens), which his parents disapproved, to Una Wing had rapidly broken down. He contracted a second, to Jeannine Barde, a Frenchwoman who had plenty of friends at Vichy. She died in April 1944; the following October he married another Frenchwoman, Michelle Thomas. There were no children.<br>
<br>During his gun-running activities Amery had met Jacques Doriot, a renegade French communist who had turned ardent fascist. Doriot summoned him to Paris in the autumn of 1942, convinced him that Germany was going to lose the war unless Great Britain joined against the USSR, and enlisted Amery's aid. For the next eighteen months Amery toured prisoner-of-war camps, seeking to recruit a Legion of St George&#151;unromantically renamed by the Germans the British Free Corps&#151;to fight alongside the Germans against the Russians and save Europe from Bolshevism. From thousands of prisoners, thirty men elected to join him; they never went into action. He also broadcast to his fellow countrymen in England, seeking to persuade them to change sides, and gave anti-communist lectures, notably in Oslo and Belgrade.<br>
<br>In April 1945 Amery and his wife were in northern Italy, making for Switzerland, when they were captured by communist partisans. He was handed over to the British army and sent back to England. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63313/', "(Harold) Julian Amery (later Lord Amery of Lustleigh)")</script>, attempted to establish Spanish nationality for him, but failed. He was arraigned on eight counts of treason before Sir Travers Humphreys at the Old Bailey on 28 November 1945. He pleaded guilty, knowing this would mean execution, and was hanged at Wandsworth prison on 19 December 1945 by the famous executioner Albert Pierrepoint.<br>
