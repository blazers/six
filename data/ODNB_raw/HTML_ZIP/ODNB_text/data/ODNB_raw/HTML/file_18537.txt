<span class="headword">Melton, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1640), <span class="occ">author and politician</span>, the son of Evan Melton, was born in Bampton parish, Devon, although it is possible that his family came from Yorkshire. He might be the John Melton who was admitted pensioner at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on 25 June 1608; the following year he was reading law in chambers. In August 1626 he obtained a grant of arms and in 1634 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, perhaps as an honorary member. He was married three times and fathered six children who survived infancy. His first marriage, in January 1624, was to Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Moore), widow of Sir Ferdinando Heyburne and mother to Francis and Elizabeth. In 1634 he married Catherine Currance (<i>d</i>. 1635), who brought him land in Kent, and who produced Edward, John, Richard, and Anne from two pregnancies in 1634&#150;5. Melton's third wife, Margaret Aldersley, outlived him.<br>
<br>Melton was the author of a single published poem, &#145;In laudem authoris&#146;, written in support of William Fennor's work, <span class="italic">Descriptions</span>, and two books&#151;<span class="italic">A Sixe-Folde Politician: together with a Sixefolde Precept of Policy</span> (1609) and <span class="italic">Astrologaster, or, The Figure-Caster</span> (1620). &#145;Unlike the learned treatises, which sound as though they had been addressed to men of the twelfth century&#146;, <span class="italic">Astrologaster</span> &#145;is shot through with bright threads drawn from the life of Jacobean England&#146;  (Dick, iii&#150;iv). It was sufficiently well known to be incorporated by William Rowland into his <span class="italic">Judicial Astrologie, Judicially Condemned</span> (1652), an attack on parliament's use of astrologers. Both books contain anti-Catholic rhetoric.<br>
<br>By 1624 Melton was secretary to Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, and the continued patronage of the Percy family brought him wealth and furthered his career. By 1632 he was serving Northumberland as receiver of rents and it might have been this that in 1628 gained him membership of a commission for levying debts due to the crown. His work for Northumberland brought him to the attention of Sir Thomas Wentworth, who in May 1625 asked Melton to gain for him the votes of the earl's freeholders in the Yorkshire election. Melton was Wentworth's replacement for Sir Arthur Ingram in the office of secretary to the council of the north. He bought the office in April 1632 and held it until his death, exercising it in person. On 11 September 1632 he was knighted at Wanstead, and the next year Wentworth took him on to the northern recusancy commission, where he supported the vice-president of the north, Sir Edward Osborne, in the face of several threats to the commission's work. Most of his letters to Wentworth refer to the commission's business, but he penned one letter in May 1635 to encourage Wentworth to bid for the post of lord treasurer.<br>
<br>Melton's commercial interests in saltpetre and coal appear to have been of significant financial benefit to him. By 1631 he was deputy saltpetreman for Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland, and during the 1630s he leased several mines from the earl of Northumberland and traded in coal, enabling him to leave manors in several counties, mining interests, and jewellery, in all worth about &pound;2000, and more than &pound;6000 in money to his family. He was elected as MP for Newcastle upon Tyne in the autumn of 1640, gaining the seat through Northumberland's patronage. He died in December, before his disputed return was handled by the committee for privileges, probably at Tottenham, for he was buried there, rather than at York Minster, his chosen resting-place. A monument to his memory was placed in Tottenham church.<br>
