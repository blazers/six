<span class="headword">Wedderburn,  James</span>  (1585&#150;1639), <span class="occ">bishop of Dunblane</span>, was born in Dundee, the second son of John Wedderburn, a Dundee mariner and shipowner, and his wife, Margaret Lindsay, and grandson of James Wedderburn (1495?&#150;1553), the protestant sympathizer and dramatist. Although the extant records reveal nothing of his early education, he was sufficiently qualified to matriculate at the University of St Andrews in 1604. He graduated MA four years later. Like many of his contemporaries Wedderburn chose to further his studies outside Scotland, most probably at Cambridge University. While in England he was tutor to the children of the French classical scholar Isaac Casaubon. Wedderburn was instituted minister of Harston parish church in Cambridgeshire in 1615, but his incumbency was of a relatively short duration. He returned to Scotland in 1617 to take up the prestigious post of professor of divinity at St Mary's College, St Andrews. At some point prior to January 1623 the degree of doctor was duly conferred upon him. While Wedderburn was evidently an extremely able and learned divine, his appointment at St Andrews had more to do with his Anglican sympathies than his academic qualifications and suitability for the post. It was no coincidence that his elevation to the professorship coincided with the crown's attempt to reform the university on an Anglican template. Nevertheless, animosity towards Wedderburn's Arminian theology and his strong advocacy of Anglican practice in Scotland probably accounted for his decision to quit his post after nine years.<br>
<br>In February 1626 Wedderburn took up a new charge at Compton parish church within the diocese of Winchester. Later that same year he was also made a canon of Ely Cathedral. Further preferment followed when, on 12 September 1628, Charles I presented him to the vicarage of Mildenhall in the diocese of Norwich, and on 26 May 1631 he was made a prebendary of Whitchurch in the bishopric of Bath and Wells.<br>
<br>After returning to Scotland, under the auspices of William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury, Wedderburn was appointed dean of the Chapel Royal, Stirling, in October 1635. On 11 February 1636 he was finally elevated to the episcopate when he succeeded Adam Bellenden as bishop of Dunblane. Wedderburn is best remembered for his contribution to and involvement in the introduction of the highly controversial Scottish prayer book of 1637. Although Wedderburn rejected many of the central tenets of Tridentine Roman Catholicism, he believed that the reformers had been too hasty in leaving the Roman fold. His advocacy of the re-unification of Western Christendom, encapsulated in his &#145;Notes&#146; and &#145;A treaty on reconciliation&#146;, some of which were published in Robert Baillie's <span class="italic">A Large Supplement of the Canterburian Self-Conviction</span> (1641), gained him few admirers in Scotland. He fled Scotland in the wake of the covenanting revolution and was deposed along with his fellow bishops by the Glasgow assembly in December 1638. He died, unmarried, at Canterbury on 23 September 1639 and was buried in the chapel of the Virgin Mary in the cathedral there.<br>
