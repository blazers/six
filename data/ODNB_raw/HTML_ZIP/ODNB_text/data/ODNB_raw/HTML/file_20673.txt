<span class="headword">Old,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1557), <span class="occ">translator and religious controversialist</span>, was possibly a son of John Olde of Sheriffhales in Shropshire. His early biography is shrouded in obscurity: the date and place of his birth are unknown and little information concerning his formal education has survived. That he was a graduate is undoubted: his contemporaries, and later the historian John Strype, describe Old as a doctor of theology, though none of them gives any indication as to which university he attended.<br>
<br>The earliest known event of Old's life shows him already closely associated with persons who favoured reform of the English church in a protestant direction. In 1543 he was living in Staffordshire, and between July and December of that year granted shelter to the protestant reformers Thomas Becon and Robert Wisdom after their recantations in London on 8 July. Old had known Becon for a long time, and the two men obviously shared the same religious outlook. Becon describes Old as a man &#145;ancient in true godliness and Christian life&#146;, and implies that Old, like Wisdom and himself, was a member of a persecuted community analogous to the early church saints: &#145;He was to us, as Jason was to Paul and Silas&#146;  (Becon, 422). It seems probable that Old, whom Strype calls &#145;a teacher of youth as well as a teacher of the gospel&#146;, ran a school at this time, and with the help of Becon tutored the sons of the local gentry  (Strype, <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Memorials</span>, 2/1.47). About 1545, &#145;impelled by urgent&#146; but undisclosed causes, he left Staffordshire and travelled with Becon into Warwickshire, settling at Coventry  (Becon, 424). Once again he invited Becon to share his home, an arrangement that must have brought him into contact with the circle of protestants that Becon is known to have met in the county. This group included Old's friend of many years Hugh Latimer, who had originally converted him from Roman Catholicism to the protestant faith. Latimer stayed regularly at Baxterly Hall, the Warwickshire house of John Glover, where he was visited by Becon and almost certainly by John Old. John Glover's brother Robert was one of the attendants of Lord Ferrers of Chartley, and may possibly have recommended Old to his employer. Certainly by 1546 Old was chaplain to Lord Ferrers, in which capacity on 10 July he was examined at Westminster by the privy council on suspicion of sacramentarianism. After an abject recantation he professed himself &#145;unfeynedly to receyve the kinges majestes doctrine&#146; and after promising good behaviour he was released  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1542&#150;7</i>, 479).<br>
<br>Old's fortunes improved after the establishment of a protestant regime on the accession of Edward VI. In early May 1547 a royal visitation of the church was ordered, and Old was appointed registrar to the team of commissioners who were to visit the dioceses of Peterborough, Lincoln, Oxford, and Coventry and Lichfield. Alongside his duties as registrar he was one of the visitation's preachers, evangelizing on behalf of those protestant reforms that the visitation had been designed to promote. During the same year he took part in the translation of the first volume of the <span class="italic">Paraphrases</span> of Erasmus upon the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (published on 31 January 1548) which by order of royal injunctions of 31 July 1547 were to be placed in every parish church in England. Old subsequently accepted a commission from his friend the printer Edward Whitchurch to translate Erasmus's <span class="italic">Paraphrases</span> upon seven of St Paul's <span class="roman">New Testament</span> epistles. This arduous task, which constituted almost all of a second volume, was completed by mid-1549 and published on 19 August 1549. While executing this commission Old probably lived and worked in Whitchurch's printing shop at Fleet Street in London. On 22 March 1549 he was presented to the vicarage of Cubbington in Warwickshire by the crown. His appointment was due to a recommendation made on his behalf by Hugh Latimer to the duchess of Somerset. In his preface to the second volume of the <span class="italic">Paraphrases</span>, Old admits his debt, both to his &#145;singular friend&#146; Hugh Latimer, and to the duchess, to whom he dedicated the work on 15 July 1549. Further ecclesiastical preferments soon followed: on 19 August 1551 Old was granted the prebend of Dernford in Lichfield Cathedral, and on 4 October 1552 he was made a prebendary of the cathedral church at Hereford.<br>
<br>The accession of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary in 1553 removed the need for caution from those who had always resented Old's appointments and his religion. Clergy who had conformed under the previous regime became openly hostile, threatening him with a prosecution for heresy. At Cubbington the &#145;malicious force and rage of some unthankful people&#146;  (Old, sig. E7<i>r</i>), presumably unappreciative Catholic parishioners, contributed to Old's decision to quit his vicarage and ultimately to leave England. He fled abroad probably shortly before 19 November 1554, when he was deprived of his prebend at Lichfield and his living at Cubbington. He later admitted that his departure had been made &#145;somewhat before extreme trouble came&#146;  (ibid., E7<i>v</i>), and imputed his precipitancy to doubts about his own constancy in the face of persecution.<br>
<br>Old probably settled for a time at Emden in East Friesland, and became a citizen there on 6 May 1556. Between 1555 and 1557 he devoted his energies to the propaganda campaign waged by the exile community in Emden against the Catholic regime in England. To this end Old used his considerable skills as an author and a translator to produce works of protestant polemic which were printed in Emden and secretly distributed back in England. <span class="italic">The Acquital or Purgation of the most Catholyke Prince Edward the VI</span>, Old's first original work, was published at Emden on 7 November 1555. It was followed five months later by his <span class="italic">A Confession of the Moost Auncient &hellip; Catholike Olde Belefe</span> of April 1556. The aim of both these tracts was to strengthen the commitment of the English to Edward VI's protestant religious settlement, and to prevent their apostasy to Roman Catholicism. The same purpose was served by his translation of Rudolph Gualter's sermons upon Antichrist, a violently anti-papal work that was published the same year. Old also edited for publication at Emden documents written by his persecuted co-religionists in England. The speed with which these works were published after their composition suggests that Old was still in contact with protestants in England who must have smuggled the manuscripts out to him. These included Nicholas Ridley's account of his prison &#145;conferences&#146; with Hugh Latimer, and possibly Thomas Cranmer's letters to Queen Mary and Drs Martin and Scory; both these works were published in 1556.<br>
<br>Old left Emden and finally settled at Frankfurt am Main in Germany with his wife (her name is unknown). His name appears on the city tax lists for 15 January 1557, which record that he had no property. As a member of the English stranger church in Frankfurt during 1557 he became involved in the dispute concerning church government between the minister, Robert Horne, and the greater part of his congregation. Old sided with the majority, and in April 1557 signed the reformed scheme of discipline, whereupon Horne and his deacon, Richard Chambers, left Frankfurt, taking the church alms with them. By 10 June Old was living with his wife in the house of Edward Oldsworth, another member of the English congregation in the city, while on 30 June he was one of those to whom Chambers addressed a letter justifying his &#145;administration of the church funds&#146;  (Garrett, 241). Old died at Frankfurt on 15 September 1557.<br>
