</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spohr,  Louis</span>  (1784&#150;1859), <span class="occ">composer, violinist, and conductor</span>, was born on 5 April 1784 at what is now Spohrplatz 7, Brunswick, the first of the seven children of Carl Heinrich Spohr (1756&#150;1843), a medical doctor, and his cousin Juliane Ernestine Luise Henke (1763&#150;1840). His baptismal name was Ludewig, but his parents, following the fashion of the day, called him Louis; it was by that name he signed himself in later life and under which his compositions were generally published. Spohr's mature height was about 6 feet 6 inches, and he was powerfully built. His upright character enhanced his reputation in England; the anonymous translator of his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> observed: &#145;he has left us an example of high morality, great amiability, and bright domestic virtues, too rare, alas! among artists and men of genius&#146;  (ii). He was twice married: first, on 2 February 1806, to Dorothea Scheidler (1787&#150;1834), and second, on 3 January 1836, to Marianne Pfeiffer (1807&#150;1892).<br>
<br>Little of Spohr's music seems to have been known in England before he first visited London in 1820, to participate as both violinist and composer at the Philharmonic Society. The immediate impact of this five-month stay was limited. As a violinist he was considered to &#145;equal, if not to exceed, any player that has lately been heard in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, 1, 1820, 444). At a Philharmonic rehearsal he caused a sensation by conducting with a baton and in public by conducting with his violin bow. Among his many compositions performed during the visit was his second symphony, written early in his stay in London. The general reaction to his music is reflected in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Musical Magazine</span>'s comment that the new symphony was &#145;well received but did not excite extraordinary sensation&#146;  (2, 1820, 383); yet his distinctive musical style made a far greater impression on musicians, laying the foundations for his future popularity and influence in the country. Spohr's music became steadily more familiar in England during the nineteen years that elapsed before his second visit, but it was more popular with musicians than with the public: the inclusion of three of his works in a Philharmonic concert in 1831 prompted the suggestion that the subscribers were &#145;not yet sufficiently advanced in taste to comprehend it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Atlas</span>, 6, 1831, 140). However, his oratorio <span class="italic">Die letzen Dinge</span> (<span class="italic">The Last Judgement</span>), hailed as &#145;one of the greatest musical productions of the age&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Harmonicon</span>, 8, 1830, 466), stimulated more widespread enthusiasm after its introduction at the Norwich festival of 1830. Edward Taylor recalled, &#145;Perhaps there is no instance of a similar work, under like circumstances, having attained such speedy celebrity and such high estimation&#146;  (preface to Spohr's <span class="italic">Calvary</span>, 1836).<br>
<br>The vicissitudes of Spohr's reputation in the 1830s were neatly summarized by H. F. Chorley's comment:<blockquote>By some he has been extolled to the seventh heaven, as surpassing Mozart, Weber, and Beethoven, in right of sweet melodies, rich harmonies, and magnificent conceptions&#151;by others, degraded to the level of those respectable, but most wearisome persons, who produce a multitude of carefully-executed works, upon the liberal allowance of half an idea. (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 13, 1840, 421)</blockquote>Spohr's visit to Norwich to conduct his oratorio <span class="italic">Des Heilands letzte Stunden</span> (<span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span>, later <span class="italic">Calvary</span>) in 1839, however, was a triumph that did much to reinforce his standing in England as &#145;the greatest living musician&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 20 Sept 1839). <span class="italic">The Times</span> observed:<blockquote>there is no cold musical criticism here; no questioning or calculating, &#145;ought we to admire this, and is Spohr the great composer we have heard him described to be?&#146; We saw in the countenances of the immense multitude the most unequivocal evidences of the composer's genius. Hundreds were melted to tears, and the deep and breathless silence, which from first to last reigned throughout the vast assembly, betokened the heartfelt sympathy which thus enchained them. (21 Oct 1839)</blockquote>Spohr's presence dominated the London season of 1843. He played and conducted his own works at two Philharmonic Society concerts (one a special command performance for the queen and prince consort), and directed two performances of <span class="italic">The Fall of Babylon</span> (commissioned for the 1842 Norwich festival), the second attended by more than three thousand people. At Spohr's farewell dinner, William Horsley observed that &#145;His reputation ranks with the greatest genius of the present day and would take its position with that of past ages, with Bach, with Handel, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven&#146;  (<span class="italic">Musical World</span>, 18, 1843, 231).<br>
<br>Spohr was similarly lionized during his last three sojourns in England, in 1847, 1852 (for which he revised his opera <span class="italic">Faust</span> for Covent Garden), and 1853. After Mendelssohn's death he was almost universally acknowledged as the greatest living composer. But much of his later work, including the eighth symphony, written for the Philharmonic Society in 1848, was more coolly received, and increasing criticism was levelled against the &#145;mannerism&#146; of his works.<br>
<br>Obituaries, following his death on 22 October 1859 in Kassel (where he was buried on 25 October in the Neue Friedhof), stressed his position as &#145;the last of the Teutonic family of musical giants&#146;  (<span class="italic">Musical World</span>, 24, 1859, 713), yet by the centenary of his death his music occupied a significantly smaller place on concert programmes. Nevertheless, his influence on the generation of English composers coming to maturity between 1820 and 1840 was profound. William Spark observed that in the 1830s Spohr's<blockquote>rich, original, luscious harmonies quite fascinated our English musicians, who, in many instances, failed not to avail themselves of Spohr's style, so that the term &#145;Spohrish&#146; soon became associated with a large number of the compositions which were produced at that and subsequent periods by our native composers. (<span class="italic">Musical Memories</span>, 1888, 55&#150;6)</blockquote>One of these composers, Sir George Macfarren, recalled, &#145;Few if any composers have exercised such influence on their contemporaries as Spohr did, and many living writers may be counted among his imitators&#146;  (<span class="italic">Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography</span>). Among those whose music was seen to exhibit Spohr's influence were George Rodwell, Henry Bishop, John Barnett, Henry Smart, William Sterndale Bennett, Macfarren, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Edward J. Loder, John Lodge Ellerton, Edwin J. Nielson, and many other minor composers.<br>
