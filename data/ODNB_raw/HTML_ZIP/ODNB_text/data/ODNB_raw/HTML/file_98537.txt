<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ervine,  David Walter</span>  (1953&#150;2007), <span class="occ">paramilitary and politician</span>, was born on 21 July 1953 at 11 Chamberlain Street, Belfast, the third son and youngest of the five children of Walter Ervine, engineering worker, and his wife, Elizabeth (Dolly), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tate. As a boy he attended Sunday school at the local Presbyterian church but gradually drifted away from formal religious observance. He was educated at Orangefield Boys' Secondary School but left formal education in June 1968, shortly before his fifteenth birthday. He subsequently worked in a number of manual and administrative jobs. On 1 March 1972, at the Megain Memorial Presbyterian Church, Knockbreda, Belfast, he married Jeanette Cunningham, a tobacco factory worker three years his senior, daughter of Robert Alexander (Bobby) Cunningham, fitter. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of civil conflict in Northern Ireland in August 1969 Ervine became involved in low-level vigilante activity, including the manning of barricades against the threat of republican bomb attacks. At the age of nineteen he joined the loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). His decision, he said, was inspired by the events of 21 July 1972, known as bloody Friday, when the Provisional IRA exploded some twenty-two bombs across Belfast, killing nine people. Ervine saw the decision to join the UVF as a means of defending his community.<br>
<br>In November 1974 Ervine was arrested while driving a vehicle containing a 5 pound explosive device. He was tied to the vehicle by members of the security forces and forced to disarm the bomb himself. He was subsequently convicted of possessing explosives and served six years of an eleven-year sentence before he was released in 1980. While in the Maze prison he discovered a renewed interest in education, which led to his taking GCE O-level examinations and beginning an Open University course. He was one of a number of UVF prisoners influenced by their fellow prisoner Augustus (Gusty) Spence, a founding member of the UVF, who encouraged the organization to pursue a more directly political strategy. After his release from prison Ervine had a number of jobs including running a newsagent's shop, but he was increasingly drawn towards the world of politics. In 1984 he became associated with the Progressive Unionist Party, which was popularly viewed as the political wing of the UVF. He was a candidate in the district council elections of 1985 but was not elected.<br>
<br>As the Northern Ireland peace process developed in the early 1990s Ervine played a significant role in discussions with other political actors, not least those from the Republic of Ireland. After the loyalist paramilitary groups declared a ceasefire in October 1994 he made an increasing number of media appearances, in which he was presented as someone who was close to the thinking of the UVF. His eloquence and ability to explain the loyalist position to a wide, and often critical, audience won him many admirers outside his own political constituency as well as the somewhat back-handed compliment of the nickname Dictionary Dave. He was elected to the Northern Ireland forum from the East Belfast constituency in May 1996. This was an area that for generations had been dominated by employment in heavy engineering companies and had returned Northern Ireland Labour Party members to Stormont in the 1950s and 1960s, before the outbreak of the &#145;troubles&#146;. Indeed, Ervine's father had been a member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party. In May 1997 Ervine became a member of Belfast city council when he was elected in the Pottinger ward, also in east Belfast. He retained his seat in the May 2005 council elections.<br>
<br>After the signing of the Good Friday agreement in April 1998 Ervine was a strong proponent of the agreement and for a &#145;yes&#146; vote in the subsequent referendum on it. In 1998 he was elected to the Northern Ireland assembly to represent East Belfast and was again returned to the assembly in 2003. In April 2002 he succeeded Hugh Smyth as leader of the Progressive Unionist Party. In May 2006 he announced that he was supporting the Ulster Unionist Party group in the assembly, a move which, under the D'Hondt mechanism used to allocate ministerial posts in the Northern Ireland executive, potentially gave the Ulster Unionists a third seat in the executive. In September, however, the speaker of the assembly ruled against this arrangement, leading an angry Ervine to complain that, although the Northern Ireland executive required a compulsory coalition between parties, a voluntary coalition was not permitted.<br>
<br>Ervine died at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, on 8 January 2007 following a heart attack and stroke. He was buried at Roselawn cemetery near Belfast on 12 January 2007. A funeral service held earlier that day at Newtownards Road Methodist Church was attended by many leading political figures including Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams. Adams's presence, in a staunchly Unionist area, was in itself perceived as a measure of success for the peace process in which Ervine had played a significant part. He was survived by his wife, Jeanette, and their two sons.<br>
