<span class="headword">Matcham,  George</span>  (1753&#150;1833), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was born at or near Bombay, India, the only surviving son of Simon Matcham (<i>d</i>. 1776), superintendent of the Bombay marine of the East India Company, and his wife, Elizabeth, formerly Bidwell. Matcham's travels began when he was sent from Bombay to Charterhouse School, and put under the guardianship of Henry Savage, a director of the East India Company. On leaving Charterhouse in 1769 he returned overland to India and entered the Bombay civil service in 1771, subsequently becoming the East India Company's resident at Broach until its cession to the Marathas in 1783.<br>
<br>His father's death left Matcham with a good inheritance. In 1777 his mother sailed to England, to live near Canterbury, while he travelled overland to join her, spending his home leave exploring England and Ireland, where he had cousins. In 1780 he again crossed the desert on his way back to India. Matcham followed various routes: sometimes taking a ship through the Mediterranean to explore the Greek islands and view their antiquities; on another journey, he sailed through the Red Sea; at other times his route carried him through Kurdistan, Turkey, and the Balkan lands, into western Europe. He normally crossed the desert on horseback, either alone or in the company of other Europeans, and accompanied by Arab guides and servants. From the frequency of these expeditions, he was well known to such British diplomats as Sir Robert Murray Keith at Vienna and Sir Joseph Yorke at The Hague, and on one occasion he was presented at the court of the emperor Joseph II, to whom he recounted his travels. Accounts of these journeys were said to appear in James Capper's <span class="italic">Observations on the Passage to India</span> (1783) and Eyles Irwin's <span class="italic">Voyage up the Red Sea</span> (1780; 3rd edn, 1787, 2 vols.) but Matcham's precise route is difficult to establish from these sources.<br>
<br>Matcham retired from the service in 1785, and the following year settled with his mother at Enfield, near Bath. There he met Catherine 
    (Kitty; 1767&#150;1842)
  , daughter of the Revd Edmund and Catherine Nelson, and sister of Horatio, later Viscount Nelson (1758&#150;1805). Two months later, on 26 February 1787, they were married at Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, by her father, and they stayed at Barton Hall, near Norwich, for the birth in 1789 of <a href="#cosubject_18320">George Matcham [<i>see below</i>]</a>. The Matchams then moved to Ringwood, Hampshire, where their subsequent seven children were born. In 1797 they decided to move to Bath for the sake of the children's education, and subsequently to Ashfold Lodge, Sussex. Throughout these moves, they kept in close contact with the Nelson family, and followed with interest the progress of their famous naval relative.<br>
<br>On his Hampshire and Sussex estates, Matcham was concerned with the planting and improvement of his property; he took pleasure in guiding the education of his children, and in his own liberal studies. He sent many letters to the higher authorities of the state, proposing various improvements. These were mostly ignored, one exception being the conversion of some marshy ground into a public pleasure garden in St James's Park. His patent (no. 2676 of 1803) for a method of raising sunken vessels or other heavy objects was likewise ignored, as it was completely impractical. His specification described a leathern bag filled with water, and attached to a rope led over a pulley and counterweighted. When air was pumped into the bag, the counterweight would, he supposed, raise the air-filled bag and the wreck to the surface. Matcham died at Kensington on 3 February 1833; Catherine spent her widowed years at Holland Park, Kensington, where she died on 2 April 1842.<br>
<br>Their son <a name="cosubject_18320"></a><span class="headword">George Matcham</span>  (1789&#150;1877)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 7 November 1789, and entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1808, where he graduated LLB in 1814 and LLD in 1820. He was an advocate of Doctors' Commons, 1820&#150;30. On 20 February 1817 he married Harriet, eldest daughter and heir of William Eyre, of Newhouse, Whiteparish, Wiltshire. They are known to have had at least one son, William Eyre Matcham, his father's sole executor, since his mother died before his father. George Matcham maintained his association with Wiltshire, serving as justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant of the county, and in due course residing at Newhouse. He became chairman of Wiltshire quarter sessions in 1836, an office he continued to hold until 1867. He drew on his lifelong antiquarian pursuits to contribute accounts of the hundreds of Downton and Frustfield to R. C. Hoare, <span class="italic">Modern History of Wiltshire</span> (1825), and published a collection entitled <span class="italic">Notes on the Character of Lord Nelson</span> (1861). He died at Newhouse in 1877, in the words of an obituarist:<blockquote>Ripe in years, and honoured and revered by all his relatives and friends, with a vigorous mind unimpaired to the last, he passed away on 18 January last, leaving a character almost peculiar to our nation, of an accomplished, an able, and useful country gentleman. (<span class="italic">Law Magazine and Review</span>, 416)</blockquote>
