<span class="headword">West,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1770), <span class="occ">drawing-master</span>, was born in Waterford, Ireland, the son of a city alderman, and studied in Paris with Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher and Carle Vanloo. He then started a drawing school in George's Lane, Dublin, and in 1744 was employed by the Dublin Society to teach twelve boys there. When the society established its own drawing school in Shaw's Court, off Dame Street, in 1757, West was appointed the first master. Many of his pupils went on to become well-known artists. He suffered a mental breakdown, and in 1763 was replaced by a former pupil, Jacob Ennis. On Ennis's death in 1770, West was reappointed, but died in Dublin in the same year. His drawing of Lawrence Richardson was engraved in mezzotint by R. Purcell in 1748 and published in Dublin.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_29082"></a><span class="headword">Francis Robert West</span>  (<em>c.</em>1749&#150;1809), <span class="occ">drawing-master</span>, also studied in Paris as a pupil of Vanloo, and worked in the French Academy. On 11 October 1770 he succeeded his father as master of the Dublin School of Design; his pupils included the portrait painter Martin Archer Shee. A talented draughtsman in crayon, Francis West painted little in oils. Ten plates of moral emblems were engraved after his designs. He died in Dublin on 24 January 1809. The National Gallery of Ireland holds six portraits in charcoal and pastel by F. R. West.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_29097"></a><span class="headword">Robert Lucius West</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1849), <span class="occ">drawing-master</span>, was the son of Francis, and acted for some years as his father's assistant. On his father's death he succeeded to the mastership of the school, which he retained for about forty years. He painted portraits and historical subjects, and in 1808 exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, a work inspired by Thomas Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy</span>. He was a member of the Irish Society of Artists, and on the foundation of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1823 was one of the original academians. He died in early 1849.<br>
