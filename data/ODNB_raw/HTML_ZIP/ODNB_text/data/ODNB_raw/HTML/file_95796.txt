<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Montefiore,  Hugh William</span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">bishop of Birmingham</span>, was born on 12 May 1920 at 35 Palace Court, Bayswater, London, the third son of Charles Edward Montefiore Sebag-Montefiore (1884&#150;1960), senior partner of the family stockbroking firm, a former lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, and a noted philanthropist, and his wife, Muriel Alice Ruth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> de Pass (1891&#150;1977), eldest daughter of Charles de Pass, also a stockbroker. Though his parents used the surname Sebag-Montefiore, in adult life he always used the abbreviated surname, Montefiore.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Montefiore's Sephardi Jewish parents were ill matched: his father energetic, bold, and practical; his mother artistic, romantic, and reticent. (Later in life she was diagnosed with manic depression and after her husband's death converted to Christianity.) In 1925 the family moved to 2 Palace Green, Kensington. They had eight servants and attended the Lauderdale Synagogue in Paddington. Hugh went to two preparatory schools before entering Rugby School in 1933. A comment in an early school report&#151;&#145;careless, slapdash and takes no pains&#146;  (Peart-Binns, 20)&#151;stung him into becoming a lifelong workaholic. His social conscience was awakened when he visited the Rhondda valley and Durham, where the dire situation of unemployed miners affected him. He joined the officers' training corps, gained his rugby colours, and loved etching and painting. He had to work hard to achieve success. His final school report contains a clue to a character trait: &#145;Enterprising and fluent&#151;occasionally rather too much of both&#151;but always interesting&#146;  (ibid., 26).<br>
<br>Montefiore had thought of becoming a rabbi until one wintry afternoon, aged sixteen, when his life was abruptly and indelibly changed: &#145;I suddenly became aware of a figure in white whom I saw clearly in my mind's eye. I heard the words &#147;Follow me&#148;. Instinctively I knew that this was Jesus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oh God, What Next?</span>, 1). He had not even read the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. His parents were devastated but continued to show him affection. For his brothers and the wider Jewish community it was apostasy.<br>
<br>Montefiore went to St John's College, Oxford, in 1939 to read a shortened one-year &#145;war&#146; version of classics, before enlisting for army service. He served with the Royal Buckinghamshire yeomanry (99 field regiment RA). Rigid discipline and a vigorous sense of duty were implanted. At 6 feet 3 inches he was imposing, with a large, mobile, sharp, and intelligent face. He was promoted to captain and served in India and Burma, where he was fearless in leading his men. During the battle of Kohima he narrowly escaped death when a Japanese bullet nicked the sleeve of his pullover, killing the colonel lying next to him. There were two momentous changes in Montefiore's own life during the war. First, he made the decision to be ordained in the Church of England. Second, he had always felt shy and awkward with girls until he was attracted by the brains and beauty of Elisabeth Mary Macdonald Paton (<i>d</i>. 1999) of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, who was to take a first in English, and whom he met at Student Christian Movement meetings. Her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35414/', "William Paton")</script>, was a Presbyterian and one of the great figures of ecumenism. They became engaged as Montefiore joined the army and were married in St Albans Cathedral on 1 December 1945, a fortnight after his repatriation, when she was twenty-six. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>After returning to St John's College Montefiore achieved a first in theology in 1947 and proceeded to Westcott House Theological College, Cambridge. For ordination in 1949 he went to welcoming, warm-hearted Newcastle, serving his curacy at St George's, Jesmond. &#145;He got things done&#146; was his vicar's verdict  (private information). And it was done with vivacity, verve, boldness, and imagination. Two years later he made a wrong decision by returning to Westcott House as chaplain and tutor, then vice-principal. He felt himself a <i>tertium quid</i> with the regime of Kenneth Carey, Alan Webster, and later Robert Runcie. The immense teaching load of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> doctrine with twenty-seven supervisions a week was endangering his marriage and led him to the verge of a breakdown. He suffered a ruptured disc that affected him spasmodically for the rest of his life. He was invited to be chaplain of St John's College, Oxford, but Carey held him to his contract by refusing to release him, and when he was able to resign, in 1954, it was without a job to go to.<h2>
<a name="Cambridge"></a>Cambridge</h2>Charles Raven, an old Caian and former vice-chancellor of the university, came to the rescue by recommending Montefiore as fellow and dean of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, to which was added in 1959 a lectureship in the faculty of divinity. He made himself available to undergraduates and ensured that the well-attended chapel had an &#145;open&#146; table to all who presented themselves for holy communion. Another characteristic, already well developed, was now immense, namely his insatiable lust for activity&#151;lecturing, writing, preaching, thinking, reading, endless pastoral calls, and much travelling. In personality he moved from ebullience to depression, was adversarial and vulnerable, self-confident and guilt-ridden, and always &#145;driven&#146; beneath a cloud of self-doubt.<br>
<br>Montefiore was on the top of Mount Carmel during a sabbatical in 1963 when a telegram arrived offering him the living of Great St Mary's, Cambridge, in succession to Mervyn Stockwood and Joe Fison, who were respectively elevated to the bishoprics of Southwark and Salisbury. Montefiore did not have Stockwood's magnetism nor the fire for God of Fison, a prophet who disturbed with affection. He rather saw this as an opportunity to bring academic learning to the service of pastoral ministry. With the help of two curates, a Roneo machine spluttering out sermons, and a red mini driven Jehu-like, the parish was organized for up to seven services on a Sunday as well as weekday celebrations. There were criticisms of Montefiore for being too donnish in the pulpit, and for being brusque with people. Nevertheless Great St Mary's continued to draw &#145;town&#146; and &#145;gown&#146; and attracted capacity congregations to hear the outstanding preachers and leaders of the age.<br>
<br>Montefiore's arrival at Great St Mary's in 1963 coincided with the publication of John Robinson's <span class="italic">Honest to God</span>. It was a fertile time for radical thinking. Montefiore contributed with <span class="italic">Truth to Tell</span> (1966) and an essay in <span class="italic">Soundings</span> (1967). He was too much of a whirlwind, courageous, and full of enthusiasms to be in the academic top rank of theological thought, but there was a distinctive legacy in <span class="italic">The Probability of God</span> (1985), on the support that science could give to theistic belief, and <span class="italic">Credible Christianity</span> (1994). He regarded his major contribution as the essay <span class="italic">What I Believe</span>, which he wrote for the doctrine commission report, <span class="italic">Christian Believing</span> (1976). He had been appointed to the new commission in 1967.<br>
<br>Montefiore appeared to enjoy deliberately provoking controversy, sometimes with unintentional consequences. He read a paper at the annual conference of modern churchmen at Oxford in July 1967 in which he speculated about whether Jesus was homosexual in nature. He did not describe Jesus as a homosexual, but the use of the word was sufficient to cause a conflagration. Ian Paisley charged him with &#145;diabolical blasphemy&#146;  (Peart-Binns, 127), and many erstwhile supporters were hostile. There was a clamour for him to resign. The prime minister's appointments secretary, John Hewitt, was determined that he should never be a diocesan bishop and, until Hewitt retired, he was effectively blocked.<br>
<br>In 1969 Montefiore published <span class="italic">The Question Mark: the End of Homo Sapiens</span>, about the terrifying results of man's obsession with growth and rapid and easily acquired prosperity. This book, praised by U Thant, Arthur Koestler, and Gordon Rattray Taylor, led to Montefiore's notable involvement with environmental and technological concerns. He chaired commissions on population control, reprocessing nuclear waste at Windscale, cultural pluralism, management accountability, and designing for survival. In 1972 he organized and chaired an independent commission on transport, which, in less than a year, produced <span class="italic">Changing Directions</span>, which stopped just short of advocating the restriction of car ownership. In 1976, as president of the Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise, he went to America for a one-day hearing on Concorde and criticized the way in which the United Kingdom government had measured noise levels and subsequently misled parliament. Labour and Conservative MPs tried to lampoon him but failed because his arguments were based on hard evidence.<br>
<br>At Cambridge the pace and self-inflicted pressures were unsustainable, resulting in absence from duties for three months. How long could he keep the Great St Mary's circus on the road? John Robinson, then dean of Trinity College, Cambridge, may not have looked like God's messenger, but he was Bishop Mervyn Stockwood's forerunner when, in the late autumn of 1969 over lunch, he slipped into the conversation, &#145;Oh, by the way Hugh, would you like to be Bishop of Kingston?&#146; The approach was sanctioned by the archbishop of Canterbury and the appointment was announced on 7 January 1970.<h2>
<a name="KingstonuponThames"></a>Kingston-upon-Thames</h2>The suffragan see of Kingston-upon-Thames covers an area from Brixton and Clapham to Wimbledon and Richmond. Dissatisfied with proposals of where he should live, Montefiore's mother lent him the money to buy White Lodge in Wandsworth, which would be his home again when he left Birmingham. David Sheppard was his fellow suffragan at Woolwich. Led by Stockwood, Southwark was at the time the most exciting diocese in the Church of England. Intellectually a radical socialist and emotionally a high-church tory with friends in high places, Stockwood had a sense of theatre. He knew how to perform and needed a strong supporting cast. The imprint of Stockwood was unmistakable in Montefiore, who was perhaps unwise to learn his bishoping from him. Gradually Montefiore made his own way and revealed great pastoral concern and care for people.<br>
<br>Montefiore was not ideally suited to a secondary position. Archbishop Donald Coggan endeavoured to place him into the deanery of St Paul's Cathedral, to no avail. The Church of England was waiting to see who would be Birmingham's new bishop in 1977, the first appointment under the new Crown Appointments Commission. When fifty-seven-year-old Montefiore was named there was an immediate campaign to reject him, orchestrated by the <span class="italic">Birmingham Evening Post</span> and some local Conservative MPs, notably Anthony Beaumont-Dark. How could such a bishop come to the home of the motor car and British Leyland? The &#145;welcomers&#146; were those who recognized his extraordinary combination of intellect, moral passion, and concern for the underprivileged.<h2>
<a name="Birmingham"></a>Birmingham</h2>After the calm, reassuring, and uneventful episcopate of Laurence Brown, Montefiore swept in on his episcopal chariot like an imperial Caesar come to administer justice. He bullied, cajoled, and annoyed to get his way. Yet in his study he was superb at listening, caring, and encouraging. If he unintentionally caused pain he was distraught. He bore no malice and his flashes of temper were soon forgotten. He visited all the clergy and their families and photographed them, not merely as a memory aid but so that he could hold them and their needs in prayer in his private chapel. Hours of time were spent with sad cases of moral failure, scandal, or breakdown, and, although he could be fierce, he searched for practical solutions.<br>
<br>Temperamentally Montefiore was a hierarchical person with a dash of the patriarch. He inaugurated <span class="italic">The Bishopric</span>, a periodical to further his teaching ministry. His presidential addresses to the diocesan synod were on matters of public moment in church and state. His style was usually animated and often adversarial. He was a &#145;loner&#146; in his intellectual work, rapidly formulating with precision what he wanted to say. He was always in danger of unwarranted dogmatism, and because he fly-whisked criticism aside it required very determined alertness to challenge him. Examples of his endless initiatives were: a &#145;vision&#146; (a favourite expression) for lay education and training in the parishes directed by himself; an appeal in 1984 for bicycles and mattocks to be sent to the battered church in Uganda; and a diocesan pilgrimage of 3000 people to Canterbury in 1986. He energetically sought good relations with the Islamic and Hindu faiths and the Afro-Caribbean community.<br>
<br>In 1982 Montefiore succeeded Graham Leonard, bishop of London, as chairman of the Church of England's board for social responsibility. It was a daring appointment of someone who could be unpredictable and volatile. The major time-consuming topics were the Church of England's response to the Warnock report, <span class="italic">Human Fertilization and Embryology</span> (1984), and the welfare state and social diversity in an ever-changing Britain. However, Montefiore's greatest triumph in the general synod came earlier, in 1983, when he was unexpectedly eirenic on the controversial report <span class="italic">The Church and the Bomb</span>, which opted for unilateral disarmament. He was neither dove nor hawk, and his speech and its accompanying successful amendment were a <i>tour de force</i>, saving the day. It required the government to provide adequate defence, urged it to negotiate disarmament urgently, and insisted that nuclear weapons could only be held on the basis of &#145;no first use&#146;.<br>
<br>None the less, Montefiore's demeanour did not make him one of the synod's most persuasive speakers. He was considerably better on his feet in the House of Lords, where he made his maiden speech on 23 January 1985. For the next two years he was a frequent speaker. When the <span class="roman">Shops Bill</span> (1986), which would have ended the regulation of Sunday trading in England and Wales, occupied the house for eight long days, Montefiore strenuously opposed total or extensive deregulation. On one occasion he was supported by twenty spiritual peers, a near record for the twentieth century. The bill was later unceremoniously thrown out by the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Montefiore almost made history when he introduced his own bill&#151;the <span class="roman">Infant Life (Preservation) Bill</span>&#151;on 17 December 1986. Its simple and single aim was to change the twenty-eight week limit for abortions to twenty-four weeks. During the debate on 29 January 1987 there was much passion, noticeably from opponents. However, it passed its second reading. Afterwards Lord Whitelaw, leader of the house, informed Montefiore that three peers, violently against the bill, threatened to filibuster it out of existence. It went to a select committee whose members were largely hostile. By the time the committee reported Montefiore had retired and his bill lapsed.<br>
<br>Montefiore's energies were consumed in principles and causes to which he tenaciously clung like a limpet, until he reversed his position, which was then equally vociferously defended. In 2004 he was forced to resign from his twenty-year trusteeship of Friends of the Earth when he switched from opposing nuclear power to advocating its use. Similarly, he continually re-examined his own beliefs. He was agnostic on the virgin birth but did not doubt the empty tomb or the physical resurrection of Jesus. He was a vocal critic of the views of David Jenkins, bishop of Durham.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandfinalyears"></a>Retirement and final years</h2>Montefiore was the most remarkable bishop of his time. He wrote twenty-eight books (twelve of them in retirement) and edited or contributed to a further forty-five works, including important pamphlets. In 1987, still at the height of his powers, he resigned to care for his wife, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Montefiore never realized the respect and affection in which he was held until 7000 people attended a farewell eucharist at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham on 31 March.<br>
<br>Retirement brought Montefiore an inner emptiness, which was assuaged with writing books, lectures, exhortations, and a weekly column in <span class="italic">Church Times</span>. He chaired Transport 2000 and a charity for the homeless. He was taken ill on his eighty-fifth birthday, while dining with one of his daughters, and died the following day, 13 May 2005, at St George's Hospital, Tooting, of an aortic aneurysm. At his funeral at St Mary Magdalene, Wandsworth Common, on 21 May the congregation were invited to clap the man they loved. There was thunderously charged applause. Private cremation followed. For all Montefiore's achievements there was an underlying melancholy about this engaging and sensitive man, a living tornado with a human face. He said: &#145;I was deracin&eacute;; an exile from the Jewish community and, I felt, not really accepted in the Christian community&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oh God, What Next?</span>, 240).<br>
