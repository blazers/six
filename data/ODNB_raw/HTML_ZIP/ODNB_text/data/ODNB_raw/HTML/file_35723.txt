<span class="headword">Relf,  Ernest Frederick</span>  (1888&#150;1970), <span class="occ">aerodynamicist</span>, was born in Beckenham, Kent, on 2 October 1888, the younger child and only son of Thomas Joseph Relf, businessman, and his wife, Marion Weeks. Relf's early education was frequently interrupted by family removals. However, his father, a linguist and very versatile musician, himself took a hand in his son's education. Relf could read music before he could read print, and schooling in the three Rs was matched by musical instruction, both amateur and professional. In 1903 his family home was in Portsmouth; Relf sat the dockyard entrance examination, won first place, and in January 1904 entered the dockyard as an apprentice shipwright: this involved part-time attendance at the Royal Dockyard School. Soon afterwards, at sixteen, he was appointed organist at one of Portsmouth's largest churches, and two years later was nearly persuaded to make music his career. But his record at the Royal Dockyard School was outstanding and in 1909 he won a royal scholarship to the Royal College of Science. Here he read mathematics and physics as principal subjects, won the Tyndall prize, and in 1912 duly obtained his associateship of the Royal College of Science (ARCS) with first-class honours. In August 1912 he was appointed a junior assistant in the aeronautics section of the engineering department of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington; he thus came under the influence of Leonard Bairstow, then head of the section. When Bairstow left in 1917 the section became an independent aerodynamics department; from 1917 to 1920 it was under the direction of T. E. Stanton and from 1920 to 1925 of R. V. Southwell. Relf succeeded Southwell as superintendent in 1925.<br>
<br>Relf's first thirteen years at the NPL showed his brilliance and versatility as a scientist and engineer. Among his hobbies were electrical engineering and photography; he put both to good use in his aerodynamical and related research. In this period he published some forty scientific papers on a wide variety of topics: from the visualization of flow in liquids to the use of an electrical analogue to determine streamlines; from aeroplane stability to the design and manufacture of a special electrical motor, the problems of which had defeated the electrical industry and which now became standard equipment; from the determination of the virtual inertia in yaw of an airship to the &#145;singing&#146; of bracing wires; these and many more. His work was regarded as of such importance that he was not called up in 1914, although he was attested and served one day in the services. In 1919 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology offered Relf its newly founded chair of aerodynamics; he declined the appointment. Later, he took part in two Oxford expeditions: in 1923 to Spitsbergen and in 1924 to Nordaustlandet, under the leadership of George Binney. Relf was physicist, surveyor, radio officer, and handyman.<br>
<br>From 1925 to 1945 Relf, as head of his department, had to become an administrator. But he never lost his zest for scientific research, even though now it had to be done by others under his direction. A most human man, he ran his team on the lightest of reins, encouraging original thought by his keen and evident interest and his helpful advice, but still keeping everyone on the appropriate road; in this way he brought out the best in his staff, seven of whom were in due course to be elected FRS. Relf himself was elected FRS in 1936 and appointed CBE in 1944: he also became a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (1926) and of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences (United States) in 1933. He won the George Taylor gold medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1935, and its highest honour, the society's gold medal, in 1953.<br>
<br>At the end of 1945 Relf left the NPL to take up for five years the post of principal of the newly founded College of Aeronautics at Cranfield. He recruited a first-class staff, and set the college on the right lines, so that in his lifetime it became the Cranfield Institute of Technology, Britain's first postgraduate university.<br>
<br>In 1951 Relf left Cranfield to devote the remaining years of his life to consultancy and music. He had already become an independent member of the Aeronautical Research Council, a body to which he gave unbroken service in various capacities for fifty years (1918&#150;68). For four years he acted as a consultant to his former department at the NPL; he also worked with Barnes Wallis and with various research associations. As to music: from his student days, when the proximity of the royal colleges of science and of music enabled him to expand his talents and to make many friends in the musical world, music permeated and supplemented his scientific life. In addition to playing the piano and organ, he composed much chamber music and some 200 songs. Some of his music, with professional performers, has been broadcast by the BBC.<br>
<br>Relf was of medium height, plump and jolly, a man who engendered a real affection in his wide circle of friends. In 1917, at Plymouth, he married Elfreda Grace, daughter of Frank Day, of the Royal Naval Ordnance Service, and his wife, Emily; they had no children. He died at his home, 28 Spinney Hill, Addlestone, on 25 February 1970.<br>
