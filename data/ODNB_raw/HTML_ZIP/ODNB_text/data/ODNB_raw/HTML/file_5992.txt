<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colquhoun,  Patrick</span>  (1745&#150;1820), <span class="occ">magistrate and a founder of the Thames police</span>, and his twin, Ann, were born on 14 March 1745 in Dumbarton. Their parents, Adam Colquhoun (1711&#150;<i>c</i>.1755), sheriff-substitute and keeper of the register of sasines for Dunbartonshire, and Isabell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Colquhoun, had at least three other children: David (<i>b</i>. 1743), Mary (<i>b</i>. 1748), and Adam (<i>b</i>. 1753). Colquhoun attended Dumbarton grammar school before travelling to Virginia, aged fifteen, to learn the tobacco trade. He returned to Scotland in 1766 and, despite his youth, became a leading Glasgow merchant. He married Janet (<i>d</i>. 1810), daughter of James Colquhoun (bailie, later provost of Dumbarton), on 22 July 1775. Six of their seven children were born in Glasgow: Frances (1776); Isabella (1777); James and Adam (1780); Janet Jane (1782); Margaret (1787). A further child, Anne Agnes, was born between Janet Jane and Margaret, but died in infancy. The family lived in Argyle Street, Glasgow. In 1782, in a somewhat ostentatious display of wealth, Colquhoun built Kelvingrove House (possibly using James Adam as architect) for use as his country residence.<br>
<br>Colquhoun was a prominent and energetic member of Glasgow society. He held a number of offices in the city, served as lord provost from February 1782 to October 1784, and was a founding member and first chairman of Glasgow chamber of commerce. He was active in identifying and encouraging new commercial opportunities to help the city survive the economic dislocation of the American War of Independence. Colquhoun visited London several times to lobby on behalf of the city's businessmen. By 1785 he was acting for British cotton manufacturers in general. Although he found lobbying tedious, writing contemptuously of &#145;the supineness of the landed interest&#146; and of the disagreeableness of having to deal with men unable to see beyond party politics, he was proud of his achievements, among which he included the creation of a Commons standing committee on trade  (Glasgow chamber of commerce MSS, Colquhoun, 9, 14, 21 June 1783; 4, 5, 21 May 1785). Ironically, by 1788 it had become clear that his own business was unable to adapt to new trading conditions. He moved to London intending to create a specialized commercial information and lobbying service  (Glasgow chamber of commerce MSS, &#145;Plan of a public agency in London for commercial affairs&#146;, October 1788) and with ambitions to become consul-general to the USA.<br>
<br>In 1792 Colquhoun was appointed, through the influence of Henry Dundas (later Viscount Melville), as a stipendiary magistrate at Worship Street police office, Shoreditch, in London. Anxious to prove his worth, he prepared an analysis of metropolitan crime and ways to prevent it. The basis of his preventive scheme was to introduce an extensive system of regulation of all those aspects of lower-class life that he deemed likely to lead to crime. This was a system of police in the eighteenth-century sense of the term: a series of regulations and regulatory agencies for the supervision of the manners, morals, and health of society rather than a body of officers in the way that the term would now be understood.<br>
<br>To Colquhoun, as to so many of his contemporaries, the liquidation of the national debt was a major priority; accordingly his scheme of police was an elaborate one designed not only to regulate social ills and to prevent crime but also to raise revenue. Successive home secretaries were advised that the scheme was poorly drafted, that it threatened civil liberties, that the proposed duties were too high, and that there were procedural difficulties in piloting a bill through parliament that aimed to tax as well as to regulate, but Colquhoun failed to understand any of these objections.<br>
<br>In January 1795 Colquhoun wrote to Dundas, outlining a number of posts that might be suitable for his talents, adding that although &#145;I am infinitely indebted to your goodness for the letter you did me the honour to write &hellip; it would be more consonant to my feelings to enjoy emolument as the price of labour applied usefully for the benefit of the state&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 51/6/1029/1). Frustrated by Dundas's refusal even to see him, Colquhoun seems to have concluded that the best way to secure implementation of his proposals (and hence his own advancement) was to make an appeal to public opinion. His paper to Dundas was revised and published anonymously early in 1796 as his <span class="italic">Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis</span>. Its novel use of statistics added authority to arguments already familiar from the works of earlier writers such as Beccaria and Henry Fielding, and helped it to become an immediate success. Public recognition brought him an honorary LLD from the University of Glasgow, the ability to command a personal interview with the home secretary, and a transfer to a much less demanding post in Westminster. His evidence to the select committee on finance (1798) kept his name before the public. He worked hard to keep up the momentum, producing a pamphlet on the subject of his proposed board of police revenue in 1799 and revising and expanding his <span class="italic">Treatise</span> through another six editions.<br>
<br>Colquhoun's reputation was bolstered still further by the recognition that he received for his part in creating the Thames police. The initial plan for the Thames police was drawn up by John Harriott, probably in close collaboration with his uncle, John Staples. Harriott was an expert on river crime and, like Colquhoun, a stipendiary magistrate. Colquhoun became involved when he was asked to advise on Harriott's plans by the West India merchants. Final details were settled at a meeting between Colquhoun, Harriott, and Staples in April 1798. Thereafter, it was Colquhoun's &#145;superior knowledge and clearer insight into the management of obtaining attention to things of this kind&#146;  (Harriott, 2.110&#150;11) that secured sufficient private-sector finance for an experimental scheme in the summer of 1798. Colquhoun sought statutory backing for the new force, outlining his proposals in his <span class="italic">Treatise on the Commerce and Police of the River Thames</span> (1800), but the bill subsequently passed by parliament bore little relation to his suggestions.<br>
<br>Colquhoun craved recognition and bitterly resented what he interpreted as the government's failure to grant him appropriate reward for his services. He treasured several gifts of silver plate that were presented to him by organizations that did appreciate his efforts, instructing his children to keep them as perpetual family heirlooms (some of these are now owned by Glasgow chamber of commerce). Within his own circle of family and friends (who included Jeremy Bentham and John Lettsom) he inspired respect, admiration, and genuine affection, but even Colquhoun's admirers admitted that he was pompous and prone to &#145;hyperbolic notions&#146; (Holloway, 182&#150;6; BL, Add. MS 33107, Pelham MSS, fol. 308). He was convinced of his own expertise, once even arguing a point of law with the law officers  (TNA: PRO, TS 11/931/3302). His famous (though possibly apocryphal) admission that &#145;Even I myself have made a mistake&#146; was relished in Glasgow long after his departure from that city  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Ancient and Modern</span>). He was so unpopular in Shoreditch that in 1794 he was targeted by rioters. Colquhoun claimed that the attack was aimed at the magistracy in general, but the circulation of handbills identifying &#145;Informers, spies and agents to Mr Justice Colquhoun&#146; suggests otherwise  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/22, Colquhoun, 26 Nov 1792; HO 42/26, Colquhoun, 25 Oct 1793; HO 42/33, Colquhoun to Nepean, 21 Aug 1794).<br>
<br>In 1802, in yet another attempt to secure preferment, he prepared a lengthy account of his public services  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/66, &#145;Statement of the public services of Patrick Colquhoun esq.&#146;, 1 Sept 1802), which became the basis of an adulatory memoir by his son-in-law, G. D. Yeats (Iatros). His posthumous reputation rested partly on this memoir and partly on a misunderstanding of his characteristically eighteenth-century use of the word &#145;police&#146;. His reputation suffered in the later twentieth century as historians became more critical of the historiography of police reform and more aware of the untapped archival sources that can be used to enrich its study. It is now known that the Home Office had other sources of advice on issues of policing, that Colquhoun's reform proposals were considered unrealistic and unworkable, and that his criticisms not only exaggerated the faults of existing systems but also caused considerable resentment among his colleagues. The wider impact of his writings, however, and the extent to which they shaped long-term changes in public opinion still remain a matter for speculation.<br>
<br>The passing of the <span class="roman">Thames Police Act</span> marked the beginning of Colquhoun's disengagement from police reform. He continued to interest himself in measures to deal with the problems of the labouring poor, including the relief of indigence, the provision of a cheap system of elementary education, and emigration schemes, regularly producing promotional tracts to popularize his causes. He retired from office in 1818 and died in Westminster on 25 April 1820 of a &#145;schirrous stomach&#146; and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster.<br>
