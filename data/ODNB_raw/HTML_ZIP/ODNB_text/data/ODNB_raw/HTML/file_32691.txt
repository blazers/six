<span class="headword">Dain, Sir  (Harry) Guy</span>  (1870&#150;1966), <span class="occ">general practitioner</span>, was born in Birmingham on 5 November 1870, the eldest of six children of Major Dain, draper, and his wife, Diana Weaver. He was educated at King Edward's Grammar School (1883&#150;7) and at Mason College, to which in 1892 the medical department of Queen's College, Birmingham, was transferred. He qualified MRCS LRCP in 1893 and took the MB BS (London) in the following year.<br>
<br>Dain spent his entire career in his native city of Birmingham. After holding appointments as resident medical officer at the Children's Hospital and assistant house-surgeon at the General Hospital, he settled in general practice. Later he became head of a large partnership in Selly Oak. Dain was married twice: on 17 July 1897 to Flora Elizabeth Lewis, a nurse, who died in 1934; and on 1 February 1939 to Alice Muriel Hague, a dispenser, who survived him. There were two daughters and two sons of the first marriage, of whom one son was killed in the Second World War. One daughter and one son entered the medical profession.<br>
<br>On the introduction of national health insurance Dain began to develop a long-lasting interest in medical politics. In Birmingham he was a member of the first insurance committee and of the first panel committee. Very soon he became its chairman, and in 1917 he became a member of the insurance acts committee in London. For six years he presided over the annual conference of local medical and panel committees (1919&#150;24) and for twelve years (1924&#150;36) he was chairman of the insurance acts committee itself. During this period it was said that his name was suggested for every sub-committee or deputation to the government. Though no orator Dain had the gift of clear and persuasive speech, and an enviable ability to disentangle complicated matters. While everyone was afforded a full part in decision making, it was made easier by the way in which Dain presented the essential facts and drew attention to the root of a problem. In 1936 the Dain Testimonial Fund was established to mark his work on behalf of insurance practitioners. At his request the fund was used to help finance the education of the children of medical practitioners who had fallen on hard times.<br>
<br>In 1934 Dain was elected to the General Medical Council as a direct representative of GPs in England and Wales. He remained a member until his resignation in 1961. This was the longest period of service of any medical practitioner. Dain joined the British Medical Association (BMA) in 1896. Between 1937 and 1942 he was chairman of the association's representative body, his membership of which spanned the period 1919&#150;57. He was a member of the BMA council from 1921 to 1960, serving as chairman in the period 1943&#150;9. The 1940s were testing years for the medical profession, owing to the planning and introduction of the National Health Service (NHS). By virtue of his position in the BMA, Dain became one of the chief spokesmen for the profession. In some ways he was an unlikely leader. Well into his seventies, he was &#145;an unspectacular, competent family doctor &hellip; better known as a steady negotiator than a forceful leader&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 March 1966). However, whether he was negotiating at the ministry, or in the chair of council, or at mass meetings of the profession, or holding press conferences, he was steadfast, persuasive, honest, and patient, never departing from the principles he held to be essential. It was his great achievement to keep the profession united in the face of the most severe pressures.<br>
<br>Dain's attitude towards the proposed NHS was conditioned by his experiences as a panel practitioner and as a medical politician. These had bred in him a deep suspicion of government involvement with medicine and throughout the negotiations over the new service he fought against the prospect, real or imagined, of state control of the medical profession. He was particularly fearful that doctors would become salaried civil servants and that patients would lose their right to choose their own doctors. At the time of his election as chairman of the BMA's council (in 1943) he remained opposed to the creation of a comprehensive service, preferring instead an extension of the national health insurance scheme with the preservation of private practice on a large scale. While the wartime coalition remained in power, with Henry Willink as minister of health, Dain remained satisfied with the direction of negotiations. Indeed, in March 1945 he informed a group of Nottingham doctors that discussions with the minister comprised &#145;a constructive attempt to implement the entirely admirable preamble of the [February 1944] White Paper, <span class="italic">A National Health Service</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, Supplement, 7 April 1945, 52).<br>
<br>The advent of a Labour government with Aneurin Bevan as minister of health changed all of this, even though Dain had great personal admiration for Bevan's qualities as a politician, regarding him as knowledgeable, decisive, and determined. When the <span class="roman">National Health Service Act</span> received royal assent in November 1946 Dain's assessment was hostile. &#145;The Act&#146;, he told a BMA meeting in Exeter, &#145;is part of the nationalization programme which is being steadily pursued by the Government. What the Minister appears to have done is to have taken the Bill which we had partly fashioned and to have inserted into it the Socialist principles of State ownership of hospitals, direction of doctors, basic salary for doctors, and abolition of buying and selling of practices&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 16 Nov 1946, 747). Dain maintained this intransigent attitude throughout 1947 and well into 1948, notwithstanding Bevan's commitment that he would never introduce full-time salaried service. In a speech at Shrewsbury, delivered in April 1948, Dain urged the profession to refuse service under the act. But when the BMA's plebiscite went against this advice Dain, democrat that he was, accepted the decision without demur. In a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 18 June 1948, he pledged that the profession would &#145;do its utmost to make the new Service a resounding success&#146;.<br>
<br>In recognition of his service to his profession Dain received the honorary degrees of LLD from Aberdeen in 1939, and MD from Birmingham in 1944. As a member of more than twenty years' standing he was elected FRCS in 1945, having served for some years on the council. He was awarded the gold medal of the BMA in 1936. It was with special pleasure that in 1957 he became the first recipient of the Claire Wand award for outstanding services to general practice. He was knighted in 1961, a year after he retired, aged ninety.<br>
<br>Dain's interests in medicine were wide, and throughout his association with the BMA he continued to devote much of his time to his busy practice in Birmingham, where he was popular with patients. His leisure interests included gardening and playing bridge. In appearance Dain was short, dapper, and smart. He had blue eyes, a kindly face, and a briskness of manner. Mentally alert and physically fit into his nineties, he died at Highmead, Aberdyfi, Merioneth, on 26 February 1966. A memorial service was held at St Pancras Church, London, on 23 March.<br>
