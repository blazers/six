<span class="headword">Hygeberht <span class="st"> [Higbert]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 803), <span class="occ">archbishop of Lichfield</span>, received his see in 779  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 114). His origins are unknown, though he was presumably a Mercian. Lichfield was the chief see of Mercia, close to the royal residence at Tamworth. It was made an archbishopric at the &#145;contentious&#146; Synod of Chelsea in 787. The dominance in southern England of Offa, king of the Mercians, had been threatened by the resurgence of Kent under Ecgberht II (<i>fl</i>. 765&#150;779), of whom J&aelig;nberht, archbishop of Canterbury, had been an adherent. When Offa re-established control of Kent after Ecgberht's death, he persuaded Pope Hadrian I to divide the province of Canterbury, and the Mercian and East Anglian sees became the new province of Lichfield. J&aelig;nberht retained control of the West Saxon, South Saxon, and Kentish bishoprics, and as the senior archbishop took precedence over Hygeberht in attesting charters. After J&aelig;nberht's death in 792, Hygeberht took precedence over his successor, the Mercian Archbishop &AElig;thelheard.<br>
<br>Soon after his elevation at the Synod of Chelsea, Hygeberht consecrated Offa's son Ecgfrith as king of the Mercians. The dependence of Lichfield's enhanced status on Offa's line becomes evident after the deaths of Offa, on 29 July 796, and of Ecgfrith, on 16 December in the same year. In 797 &AElig;thelheard was driven from his see in a Kentish rising, and by 798 the new king of the Mercians, Cenwulf, was negotiating with Pope Leo III for the restoration of an undivided southern province. Objections had always been to the advancement of Lichfield, not to Hygeberht personally, and in 797 Alcuin wrote to &AElig;thelheard advising that &#145;the pious father&#146; Hygeberht should not be deprived of his pallium, but that ordination of bishops should revert to Canterbury, which is what seems to have transpired. Hygeberht retained his archiepiscopal title until at least 799, but at the Synod of Chelsea in 801 he attests, albeit in first place, only as bishop. Cenwulf's attempt to transfer the archbishopric from Canterbury to London (then a Mercian city) failed, and in 803 a council at &#145;Clofesho&#146; demoted Lichfield and restored the rights of Canterbury. Hygeberht attested the proceedings as abbot, but the location of his monastery and the date of his death are unknown.<br>
