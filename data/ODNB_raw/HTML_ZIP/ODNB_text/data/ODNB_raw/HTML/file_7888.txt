<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  Howard</span>, third baronet  (1776&#150;1861), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial official</span>, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7878/', "Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Douglas, first baronet (d. 1789)")</script>, and his second wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 16 Aug 1779), the daughter of James Wood, was born at Gosport, Hampshire, on 23 January 1776. His mother died when he was three and, his father being away at sea, he was brought up by his aunt Helena, the wife of James Baillie of Olive Bank, Musselburgh, near Edinburgh.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlymilitarycareer"></a>Education and early military career</h2>He was educated by a governess, then by a tutor, and finally at Musselburgh grammar school, but his early boyhood was spent largely with fishermen, from whom he gained knowledge of boats and the sea. He was intended for the navy, but his father died suddenly in early 1789 and his guardians&#151;without consulting him and to his bitter disappointment&#151;obtained for him a nomination to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Douglas initially failed the simple entrance examination in reading, writing, and arithmetic, but passed a few weeks later and entered as a cadet on 29 June 1790. He soon showed mathematical ability and became a favourite with Dr Charles Hutton. He appears to have been a daring boy: he spent his spare time on the river, and improved his seamanship by working his passage to and from the north on Leith and Berwick smacks.<br>
<br>Douglas passed out as second lieutenant, Royal Artillery, on 1 January 1794, and was promoted first lieutenant on 30 May 1794. Reportedly he served under the duke of York on the continent, but this appears doubtful. He commanded the artillery of the northern district during the spring 1795 invasion alarms, and in August of that year he embarked for Quebec as senior officer of a detachment of troops on board the transport <i>Phillis</i>, which was wrecked off Little Bay Head, Cape Ray, Newfoundland. Douglas suppressed an attempted mutiny among the soldiers, and the survivors were rescued by a trader and taken to Great Jervais, a fishing port on Fortune Bay, Newfoundland, where they passed the winter. They were then taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Douglas served three months, and then to Quebec, where he remained for a year. In summer 1796 he commanded a schooner scouting for the French fleet said to be making for Quebec, and in 1797 and 1798 he served at Kingston, Upper Canada, where he hunted and fished among the native people and was sent on a Canadian government mission to the Cherokees. He once skated from Montreal to Quebec to attend a ball, a feat which cost the life of a brother officer who accompanied him. He also had an affair with a young Quebec woman, and they had a daughter. Douglas returned home in 1798, and his seamanship saved the timber-laden brig in which he travelled.<br>
<br>In July 1799 Douglas married Anne (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1854), the eldest daughter of Captain James Dundas of Edinburgh, who was in the East India Company's marine service; they had six sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Douglas became a captain lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 2 October 1799 and served at Plymouth, with one of the new horse artillery troops at Canterbury and Woolwich, and for ten months with Congreve's mortar brigade (1803&#150;4). This last, organized by General Congreve (father of the rocket pioneer Sir William Congreve), comprised twenty 8 inch mortars and a battery of field guns. The intention, if the enemy landed, was to bombard them at night with continuous shell fire, preparatory to a dawn attack. Douglas became captain in 1804, but as he was required at the Royal Military College he was placed on half pay, retired from the artillery, and appointed major in the 1st battalion of the army of reserve on 12 October 1804 and the following day placed on half pay of the York rangers. He continued on the retired list of that corps until promoted major-general.<h2>
<a name="AtSandhurstandtheNapoleonicwars"></a>At Sandhurst, and the Napoleonic wars</h2>The Royal Military College (later at Sandhurst) was formally established in 1801 with its senior department, to train staff officers, at High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. From 1804 to 1808 Douglas was superintendent of the senior department, and also held until 1820 the post of inspector-general of instructions. He improved and extended the training and improved discipline. Among his students were Philip Bainbrigge, Henry Hardinge, and other well-known officers of the Peninsular period. However, opinions on him differed. Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Napier, who graduated from the senior department in 1817, alleged: &#145;Sir Howard Douglas is perfectly ignorant of military affairs and anything but &#147;able&#148; and could not <i>teach</i> what he did not <i>know</i> &hellip; Sir Howard is <i>quite ignorant</i> of fortification&#146;  (Bond, 53&#150;4). He became brevet lieutenant-colonel on 31 December 1806.<br>
<br>In 1808 Douglas was appointed assistant quartermaster-general in Spain. He joined Sir John Moore's retreating army in December at Benevente, and was present at the battle of Corunna on 18 January 1809. In July 1809 he accompanied the disastrous Walcheren expedition as assistant quartermaster-general and took part in the artillery attack on Flushing; he wrote the journal of the expedition appended to the report of the parliamentary commissioners. Douglas succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his unmarried elder half-brother, Vice-Admiral Sir William Henry Douglas, second baronet, on 23 May 1809. He then resumed his college duties. Concerned with naval warfare, he studied navigation and developed his &#145;improved reflecting circle and semicircle for land and marine surveying&#146; (patented in July 1811), for which he was elected FRS in January 1816. In 1811 Lord Liverpool sent him to the north of Spain to report on the state of the Spanish armies in Galicia and Asturias and on Spanish military resources, including the guerrillas, and how they could be assisted. After conferring with Wellington he went on his mission, and was present at the operations on the Orbigo and Esta, in the combined naval and military operations of the Spaniards and Sir Hope Popham's naval squadron on the north coast in the early part of 1812, in the capture of Lequertio, in the siege of Astorga, in operations on the Douro, in the siege of Zamorra, and at the attack on the Douro ports. At the end of August 1812 he joined the army on the advance to Burgos. The British government, expressing satisfaction with his work, then recalled him to the Royal Military College. He became brevet colonel on 4 June 1814, major-general on 19 July 1821, and lieutenant-general on 10 January 1837.<br>
<br>At the end of the Napoleonic wars Douglas had been appalled to witness the low standard of gunnery and gun drill aboard some British warships. Inspired by the brilliant training regime of Captain Philip B. V. Broke and the capture of the USS <i>Chesapeake</i> in 1813, he realized that naval officers required a basic knowledge of gunnery as part of their basic training, and that seaman gunners should be encouraged to remain in the service. In 1818 he presented his findings to the Admiralty, without success. He then began to correspond with Broke. Among the naval lords between 1815 and 1830 only Henry Hotham, who had served on the North American station and seen HMS <i>Shannon</i>, favoured modern gunnery methods. His interest may well have been reflected in the initial impetus for the gunnery training ship HMS <i>Excellent</i>, set up in 1830. Douglas's <span class="italic">Treatise on Naval Gunnery</span>, which went through five editions between 1820 and 1861, remained the basis of study until the late 1840s, when Douglas fell out with the captain of the ship, Henry Chads RN, over the significance of the new shell-firing guns. Unlike members of the &#145;liberal&#146; school, Douglas considered shells unreliable and inaccurate. War experience would prove him largely correct. Douglas's book was more than a mere artillery training manual; it encompassed key elements of national strategy, notably the development of new weapons and tactics for the bombardment of foreign naval bases&#151;initially Cherbourg in France. He considered that mortars, and later Armstrong breech-loading cannon, enabled naval forces to lay off at long range and destroy naval bases. In the Crimean War his ideas were applied at Sveaborg in August 1855 with devastating results.<br>
<br>In 1816 Douglas published his <span class="italic">Essay on the Principle and Construction of Military Bridges</span>, initially compiled in 1808 as a manuscript textbook for the Royal Military College, which reportedly gave Telford the idea of the suspension principle in bridge construction. In 1808 he had also submitted to the authorities a plan for a corps of pontooners. In 1819 he published <span class="italic">Observations on the Motives, Errors, and Tendency of M. Carnot's System of Defence</span>. His criticism of Carnot drew a reply from a French engineer, M. Augoyat. Copies of the latter work were forwarded by Douglas, then residing in Paris, to Wellington, who was officially interested in the Prussian Rhine frontier fortresses then under construction, and led to artillery experiments at Woolwich, in accordance with Douglas's suggestions, in 1822.<h2>
<a name="DouglasinNorthAmerica"></a>Douglas in North America</h2>From 1823 to 1831 Douglas was lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, where he arrived in August 1824. He was dynamic, effective, and popular. He identified with the province and encouraged its development, reorganizing local government and the militia. In 1825 fires destroyed Government House, forests, and much of the capital, Fredericton; Douglas directed the firefighting, relief, and reconstruction. He favoured British immigration but opposed the British government's pauper emigration, and he wanted adequate reserves for native North Americans. He improved communications and promoted rural schools, agricultural societies, and fairs. He saw the North American colonies as a source of strength to Britain and urged the British government to continue financial support to New Brunswick, opposing Treasury policy on the payment of customs officials. He was a founder and first chancellor of King's College, Fredericton (later the University of New Brunswick), which received its royal charter in 1829 and where he endowed an annual prize. He resisted American encroachments. The boundary dispute with the United States was referred to arbitration by the king of the Netherlands, and in March 1829 Douglas was ordered to England to advise the British delegation. While there he was awarded an honorary DCL degree by Oxford University (1 July 1829) for his work in New Brunswick, especially with King's College, and was enthusiastically cheered by the undergraduates. His presence at The Hague when the Belgians rebelled in 1830 led to his being sent on a secret observation mission on the Dutch frontier. In February 1831 he resigned as lieutenant-governor in order to campaign publicly for continued British protective tariffs for British North American timber, against the ascendant free-traders. He published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Considerations on the Value and Importance of the British North American Provinces</span> (1831). When the House of Commons rejected a whig government bill to reduce duties on Baltic timber, Douglas was acclaimed for saving the North American timber trade, and in New Brunswick a public subscription was raised to send him a service of silver plate. However, he was not favoured by the whig government, who disliked his firmness on the boundary question and also his opposition to the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> and to emancipation.<br>
<br>In 1832 Douglas published <span class="italic">Naval Evolutions on the Battle of the Saints</span>, defending his father's claim as originator of the manoeuvre of &#145;breaking the line&#146;. This work was suggested by a conversation with his old friend and school companion Sir Walter Scott. Douglas unsuccessfully contested Liverpool as a Conservative in 1832 and again in 1835. From March 1835 to December 1840 he was lord high commissioner of the Ionian Islands. The post was a difficult one, but despite criticism at home he governed firmly, if sometimes high-handedly. He foiled conspiracy, domestic and foreign, and countered Russian intrigue, promoted education and public works, and improved the revenue. He introduced a new code of laws based on the Greek model, known as the Douglas code, and founded a prize medal (the Douglas medal) at the Ionian College. At his departure the Ionian states erected a column at Corfu commemorating the achievements of his government. In 1837 he became lieutenant-general and in 1841 colonel of the 99th foot, and in 1851 was transferred to the 15th foot. In November 1851 he was promoted general. Douglas was elected a Conservative MP for Liverpool in 1842. A frequent and moderate speaker on service questions, he warned against the French naval threat, advocated a naval reserve, and attempted to gain better treatment of army surgeons. In 1846 he voted against the repeal of the corn laws, and at the 1847 dissolution withdrew from parliamentary life.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>For the rest of his life Douglas took an active interest in professional subjects. He was consulted by politicians on service matters, as by Sir Robert Peel in 1848 on the introduction of iron ships into the navy, which Douglas opposed; by Lord Aberdeen in 1854 on the descent on the Crimea, which Douglas opposed on the grounds that the season was too far advanced and the army insufficiently provided; by Lord Panmure in 1855 on army education&#151;Douglas having called attention to the decline of military education; and by Sir John Pakington on ship armour, which Douglas strongly and controversially opposed, maintaining that ordnance would in the end always prove superior to any armour that could be carried. He told the 1855 select committee on the Royal Military College of the potential value of a revived staff school. He also developed an improved screw propellor. In 1859 he was invited to be chairman of the royal commission on the defences of the United Kingdom, but declined because of his age. He was &#145;a steady assertor of the doctrine that ships could not stand against forts&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 3rd ser., 14, 1863, 91), and he recommended that the government substantially implement the recommendations of the commission's 1860 report, which resulted in the &#145;Palmerston's follies&#146; fortifications. Though in some respects a reformer, in others Douglas was conservative: for example, in the early 1850s he opposed replacement of muskets by rifles.<br>
<br>Douglas's later output included the significant study <span class="italic">Naval Warfare under Steam</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">Modern Systems of Fortification</span> (1859). Lord Palmerston, prime minister from 1855 to 1858, and again from 1859 to 1865, held Douglas in the highest regard as an adviser on defence. Douglas's work on steam tactics was overly geometric, but it inspired more practical work, at Palmerston's direction, in Admiral Sir William Fanshawe Martin's Mediterranean Fleet (1860&#150;63). His publications showed the wide scope of his scientific and technical attainments, and it has been claimed that the value of his labours lay in his peculiar capacity for grafting new discoveries on old experience and hitting the wants of the generation which had sprung up since his own youth.<br>
<br>Douglas's last service to his country was to raise doubts about the value of ironclad warships in a heated debate with John Scott Russell and the Institution of Naval Architects. Although he was wrong, Douglas had forced the exponents of the new system to think through their ideas and express their arguments with greater clarity than had hitherto been the case.<br>
<br>Although a theoretical, and conservative, contributor to the development of naval gunnery, Douglas provided a critical professional element to supplement the work of Broke and other reformers.<br>
<br>Douglas was one of the first fellows of the Royal Geographical Society and was elected an associate of the Institution of Naval Architects (1861). He was made CB in February 1817, GCMG in March 1835, KCB in July 1840, and GCB, civil division, in August 1841. Shortly before his death Palmerston offered him the military GCB, but he declined, saying he was &#145;too old for such vanities&#146;  (Fullom, 423). He had the grand cordon of Charles III of Spain and the Peninsular medal with clasp for Corunna. He was a commissioner of the Royal Military College, a patron of the Royal United Service Institution and of Wellington College, in which he took a lively interest, president of the Royal Cambridge Asylum, and supported other charities. He was colonel of the 99th regiment from 1841 to 1851 and of the 15th from 1851 until his death. For many years he was a gentleman of the bedchamber to the duke of Gloucester.<br>
<br>On 22 September 1859 Douglas's unmarried daughter, Christina Helena Emma, his companion since his wife's death, died, and the shock apparently contributed to the deterioration of his health. He died at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 9 November 1861, and was buried beside his wife at Boldre, near Lymington, Hampshire. His three elder sons had died in the service of their country, and he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his fourth son, Robert Percy (1805&#150;1891), army officer and lieutenant-governor of the Cape of Good Hope (1863&#150;8).<br>
