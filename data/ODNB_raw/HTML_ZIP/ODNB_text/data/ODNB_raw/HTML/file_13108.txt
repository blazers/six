<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hervey, Lord  Arthur Charles</span>  (1808&#150;1894), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, fourth son of Frederick William Hervey, first marquess and fifth earl of Bristol (1769&#150;1859), and his wife, Elizabeth Albana Upton (1775&#150;1844), daughter of Clotworthy Upton, Lord Templetown, was born at his father's London house, 6 St James's Square, on 20 August 1808. From 1817 to 1822 he lived abroad with his parents, chiefly in Paris, and was taught by a private tutor, Samuel Forster, former head of Norwich grammar school. He entered Eton College in 1822, where his friends included Gladstone, and he remained there until 1826. In 1827 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner and obtained a first class in the classical tripos, graduating BA in 1830. In 1828 he was awarded a college prize, and in 1830 a Latin declamation prize. Hervey was an active sportsman, and was a champion tennis player.<br>
<br>Having been ordained both deacon and priest in October 1832, Hervey was instituted in November to the small family living of Ickworth-cum-Chedburgh, Suffolk; as Chedburgh was in 1844 separated from Ickworth and joined to Horningsheath or Horringer, he also became curate of Horringer, until in 1856 he was instituted to the rectory which he held with Ickworth. On 30 July 1839 he married Patience, daughter of John Singleton of Hazeley, Hampshire, and Mell, co. Louth. They had twelve children. He took a leading part in the organization of educational institutions in the neighbouring town of Bury St Edmunds as president of the Bury Athenaeum, and was an early proposer of a system of university extension (extramural teaching) in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A suggestion for supplying the literary &hellip; institutes &hellip; with lecturers from the universities</span> (1855). In 1862 he was appointed by Bishop Turton of Ely to the archdeaconry of Sudbury.<br>
<br>On the resignation of Robert John Eden, Lord Auckland, bishop of Bath and Wells, in 1869, Hervey was offered the bishopric on the recommendation of W. E. Gladstone, and was consecrated on 21 December. In consequence of his refusal to institute a clergyman of intemperate habits, who had presented himself to a benefice, he was in 1877&#150;9 involved in a lawsuit, which was carried before the privy council. Judgment was given in his favour with costs, but being unable to recover them he had to pay &pound;1558, of which &pound;978 was raised by subscription in the diocese. As a bishop he was of moderate views on church matters, though inclined to evangelicalism. He set about making Wells the centre of the diocese, and founded church-building and choral societies.<br>
<br>Hervey researched the chronologies of Jewish history, publishing <span class="italic">The Genealogies of Our Lord</span> in 1853. As well as publishing sermons, he contributed to William Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> and to the <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span>. He was a member of the committee for the revision of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, receiving an honorary DD from Oxford University in 1885 in recognition of his work, complementing the DD received from Cambridge in 1870. Though not intellectually brilliant he was accurate and painstaking. Archaeology and family history attracted him. He wrote several papers and addresses on these subjects and served as president of the Royal Archaeological Institute. He died on 9 June 1894 at Hackwood House, near Basingstoke, the house of his son-in-law, C. Hoare. He was buried at Wells. His wife, five sons, and three daughters survived him.<br>
