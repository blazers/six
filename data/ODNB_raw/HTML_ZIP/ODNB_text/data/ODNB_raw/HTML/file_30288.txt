<span class="headword">Younger <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Finch]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1699&#150;1762), <span class="occ">actress and dancer</span>, was born on 2 September 1699, the daughter of James Younger, a soldier, and his wife, Margaret Keith (<i>d</i>. 1713). Both her parents were born in Scotland. Her elder sister was the actress and dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2358/', "Margaret Bicknell")</script>. Elizabeth Younger began her acting career as a child: she probably appeared as Princess Elizabeth in John Banks's <span class="italic">Vertue Betray'd, or, Anna Bullen</span>, to which she also spoke the epilogue, at Drury Lane on 27 March 1706. She was first cited in the bills on 29 January 1711, when she took the part of Lightning in George Villiers's <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span>, again at Drury Lane. For the 1712 summer season she appeared with a company of child actors at the playhouse in St Martin's Lane, where her roles included Cherry in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span> and Miranda in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span>.<br>
<br>On 30 September 1712 Elizabeth Younger joined the adult company at Drury Lane, playing Rose in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>. During her first season her appearances were few, perhaps partly because of the death of her mother, who was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 11 February 1713. On 3 May 1714 she was billed as a dancer in a Saraband and a Jig, &#145;being the first time of her Dancing alone on the Stage&#146;. In her early years on the stage she played a variety of supporting parts; in the 1714&#150;15 season her roles included Philadelphia in Thomas Betterton's <span class="italic">The Amorous Widow</span> and Flora in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">She Would and She Would Not</span>. On 23 February 1715 she created the role of Joyce in John Gay's farce <span class="italic">The What d'ye Call it</span>, and Sir Richard Steele took notice of her, for on 28 May 1715 she spoke the prologue at the opening of his <span class="italic">Censorium</span> at York Buildings. During the 1715&#150;16 season she took over some of the roles of her sister Mrs Bicknell, including Dol Mavis in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">The Silent Woman</span> and Lucy in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>. She was absent from the stage during the early months of 1719, when her illegitimate daughter Charlotte (by an unknown father) was probably born.<br>
<br>It was only when her sister died in 1723 that Mrs Younger was able to take on more important roles. From Mrs Bicknell she inherited Charlotte in <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> and Silvia in <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>. She was similarly restricted to supporting roles as a dancer for, although her repertory encompassed both serious and comic dances, she was billed irregularly in the entr'actes. Her most popular dance was <span class="italic">Tollet's Ground</span>, which she performed with her sister; a <span class="italic">Turkish Dance</span> choreographed by Anthony L'Abb&eacute;, which she performed with the French dancer Denoyer, was published in notation in the mid-1720s in <span class="italic">A New Collection of Dances</span>. She also danced supporting roles in afterpieces, appearing as Thalia in John Weaver's innovative dramatic entertainment of dancing <span class="italic">The Loves of Mars and Venus</span> in 1717 and as Ceres in John Thurmond's pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin Doctor Faustus</span> in 1723.<br>
<br>After an absence during the 1724&#150;5 season Elizabeth Younger returned to the stage at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 4 October 1725 as Margery Pinchwife in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span>. She immediately became one of John Rich's leading actresses; during her first season with his company she played such roles as Helena in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Rover</span>, Desdemona in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, Cordelia in Nahum Tate's version of <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and Miranda in <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span>. She was also able to create new roles, such as Myrtilla in Gay's revised version of <span class="italic">The Wife of Bath</span> (1730) and Hermione in Lewis Theobald's <span class="italic">Orestes</span> (1731). She played the part of Millamant in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span> when Rich opened his new theatre in Covent Garden on 7 December 1732. Although she did not dance in the entr'actes at Lincoln's Inn Fields, she danced frequently in pantomimes. She appeared as the Miller's Wife in <span class="italic">The Necromancer</span> (1725), and subsequently took the role of Colombine in <span class="italic">Apollo and Daphne</span> (1726), <span class="italic">The Rape of Proserpine</span> (1727), and <span class="italic">Perseus and Andromeda</span> (1730).<br>
<br>A later commentator, Thomas Davies, described both her strengths and her weaknesses in his <span class="italic">Dramatic Miscellanies</span> (1784):<blockquote>Mrs Younger &hellip; was an actress much followed in this [Belinda in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Old Bachelor</span>] and many other comic characters, especially the Country Wife. But Mrs Younger was a general actress, and sometimes appeared in tragedy, though, I think, not to advantage.</blockquote>At the end of the 1733&#150;4 season Mrs Younger retired from the stage. Following her retirement she married John Finch (1692?&#150;1763), the third son of Daniel Finch, sixth earl of Winchilsea, although the date and place of their marriage are unknown. Their daughter Elizabeth (born before the marriage of her parents) married a John Mason of Greenwich on 2 June 1757. Elizabeth Younger died on 24 November 1762.<br>
