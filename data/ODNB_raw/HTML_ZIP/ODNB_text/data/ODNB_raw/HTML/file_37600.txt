<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jennings,  (Frank) Humphrey Sinkler</span>  (1907&#150;1950), <span class="occ">film-maker, painter, and writer</span>, was born at The Gazebo, Walberswick, Suffolk, on 19 August 1907, the elder of two sons of Frank Jennings (1877&#150;<i>c</i>.1950), an architect, and of his wife, Mildred Jessie Hall (1881&#150;<i>c</i>.1950), a painter and shopkeeper. In 1916 he went to the Perse School, Cambridge, at that time a progressive institution where the classicist Dr W. H. D. Rouse was headmaster and Caldwell Cook, author of <span class="italic">The Play Way</span>, was an inspiring teacher of English and drama. Jennings soon excelled both at work and at games and showed promise as an actor, set designer, and poet. In 1926 he won a scholarship from Pembroke College, Cambridge, to read for the English tripos, which was still in its early days. His undergraduate years were busy and set the pattern for a varied working life. He painted a great deal, designed sets for many theatrical productions, including the first British performances of Stravinsky's <span class="italic">The Soldier's Tale</span> and Honneger's <span class="italic">King David</span>, and, with his fellow undergraduates Jacob Bronowski and William Empson, founded and wrote for <span class="italic">Experiment</span>, a student magazine of unusual distinction. Despite these and many other distractions he studied assiduously, particularly in sixteenth-century literature and art, and managed to take a first in part one of the tripos (1928) and a first with distinction in part two (1929).<br>
<br>On 19 October 1929, after a brief courtship, Jennings married Cicely Cooper (<i>b</i>. 1908), the daughter of Richard Synge Cooper, a civil engineer; their first daughter, Mary-Lou, was born in September 1933 and their second, Charlotte, in August 1935. Under the direction of I. A. Richards, then an influential English don, Jennings began work on a doctoral thesis about the poetry of Thomas Gray, a former student of Pembroke. This was never completed though Richards thought his research &#145;a very remarkable combination of elaborate erudition with speculative daring&#146;  (private information) and T. S. Eliot offered to publish a shortened version of one chapter in the <span class="italic">Criterion</span>. The only tangible evidence of Jennings's postgraduate labours was his edition of the 1593 quarto of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span>, published in a small edition by the Experiment Press in 1930. Chronically short of money Jennings was often forced to interrupt his studies to take short-term employment and worked as a schoolteacher in Salisbury, as a textile designer in Paris, and as a set designer at the Festival Theatre in Cambridge. Finally, in 1934, he joined the General Post Office film unit (later renamed the Crown Film Unit), which gave him his first training as an editor and director.<br>
<br>For the next five years Jennings earned his living making short documentaries, both for the Post Office and for independent production companies, where he was able to experiment with the new colour processes Gasparcolor and Dufaycolor. The greater part of his always restless energies, however, was given to his usual extra-curricular activities of painting, writing (including an angry essay on theatre for <span class="italic">The Arts Today</span>, edited by Geoffrey Grigson), and various forms of private research. For a short period he became a leading figure of the British surrealist movement, and, with Roland Penrose, Herbert Read, and others, organized the famous International Surrealist Exhibition of June 1936, at which his collage <span class="italic">Minotaur</span>, an unflattering portrait of Lord Kitchener, proved to be one of the most notorious exhibits. With David Gascoyne he translated a collection of poems by the French surrealist Benjamin Peret, <span class="italic">Remove your Hat</span> (1936). Though brief Jennings's spell as a surrealist had lasting consequences. His many years of work on <span class="italic">Pandaemonium</span>, an epic anthology of texts illuminating the industrial revolution as seen by contemporary witnesses, began with a short article for the surrealist journal <span class="italic">London Bulletin</span> in 1938, while his contributions to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92530', "Mass-Observation")</script>, the pioneering project in domestic anthropology which he founded early in 1937 with Tom Harrisson and Charles Madge, also showed marked surrealist tendencies. His principal publication while involved in the movement was <span class="italic">May the Twelfth: Mass-Observation Day Surveys 1937</span>, a collage account of George VI's coronation, co-edited with Madge for Faber and Faber.<br>
<br>Jennings's first distinctive film, <span class="italic">Spare Time</span> (1939), has sometimes been mistakenly identified as a product of Mass-Observation. In fact it marked Jennings's full-time return to the General Post Office film unit, where he remained until after the war, but the misattribution is understandable since the film&#151;a rapid series of vignettes, cut to the music of brass bands, kazoos, and other amateur performances, and almost wordless, save for a terse commentary by Laurie Lee&#151;depicted the leisure activities of working-class men, women, and children in much the same spirit as a Mass-Observation day report: deadpan, inquisitive, alert to idiosyncrasy and humour. Some of Jennings's colleagues found it condescending though it now appears far less so than many documentaries of the period and can stand comparison with certain essays of George Orwell as a remarkably sympathetic enquiry into popular culture. Like Orwell, too, Jennings was an unconventional member of the non-communist left and once defined his politics as &#145;those of William Cobbett&#146;  (Jackson, 232).<br>
<br>In collaboration with his gifted if cantankerous editor Stewart McAllister, whose contribution tended to be unjustly overlooked before Dai Vaughan's biography of McAllister, <span class="italic">Portrait of an Invisible Man</span> (1983), redressed the balance, Jennings developed the techniques of <span class="italic">Spare Time</span> in the films he made during the Second World War. In these documentaries Jennings drew on his several vocations as painter, poet, historian, and sociologist and brought each skill to a new pitch of refinement and passion. Though their fascination as a record of the home front and their efficacy as propaganda can hardly be overstated (they were among the films which helped bring the United States into the war), they are also works of outstanding eloquence, complexity, and emotional force; in brief, works of art. At least three of them&#151;<span class="italic">Listen to Britain</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Fires were Started</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">A Diary for Timothy</span> (1945)&#151;are now agreed to be masterpieces. Several contributors to <span class="italic">Sight and Sound</span>'s international poll of directors and critics in 1992 nominated one of these titles in their list of the ten best films ever made.<br>
<br>Critics have been less kind to the four films Jennings made after the war&#151;<span class="italic">A Defeated People</span> (1945), <span class="italic">The Cumberland Story</span> (1947), <span class="italic">The Dim Little Island</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">Family Portrait</span> (1950)&#151;finding them at best unimaginative, at worst complacent, and animated by a sentimental patriotism that is almost a caricature of the ardent love of his native country which fired Jennings's greatest efforts. Such at least was the limiting judgement of the film director Lindsay Anderson, whose otherwise admiring essay of 1954, &#145;Only connect&#146;, did much to keep Jennings's reputation alive through periods of neglect. Anderson called Jennings &#145;the only real poet the British cinema has yet produced&#146; and few have seriously challenged the verdict  (Jennings, 53). Yet there is little biographical evidence to support the view that Jennings was a spent force. He continued to work tirelessly at accumulating texts on science and industry for <span class="italic">Pandaemonium</span> (some of which bore fruit in <span class="italic">Family Portrait</span>), he completed dozens of paintings, and he wrote erudite, searching articles for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> and other publications. He seems to have been particularly stimulated by a visit in 1947 to Burma, where he went to look into the possibilities of a feature based on a novel by H. E. Bates, <span class="italic">The Purple Plain</span> (1947). Neither this nor any of the other features he prepared for his main post-war employer, Wessex Films, ever went into production. It is possible, as some sceptics have suggested, that he would never have thrived in the world of features although certain sequences in his dramatized documentaries <span class="italic">The Silent Village</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">Fires were Started</span> show that he was quite as comfortable with the prose of fictional narrative as with the more associative poetry of his personal form of documentary. The critic David Thomson, one of Jennings's most articulate advocates, suggests that Jennings had it in him to grow into Britain's Bu&ntilde;uel.<br>
<br>Though he is still not widely known outside specialist circles Jennings's reputation has grown with the years and his work has been brought back to a broader public on several occasions, notably by Robert Vas's <span class="italic">Omnibus</span> documentary for BBC television in 1970, by a well-received exhibition of paintings and films at London's Riverside Studios in 1982, and by the publication in 1985 of an abbreviated version of <span class="italic">Pandaemonium</span>, edited by Mary-Lou Jennings and Charles Madge, which was greeted by surprised and enthusiastic reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. His wartime films are regularly screened and discovered by new generations, at the National Film Theatre.<br>
<br>Jennings was appointed OBE, in 1946, for his contributions to sustaining morale at home and for publicizing the British cause abroad; he was promptly &#145;excommunicated&#146; by one of the surviving surrealist factions. He died, on 24 September 1950, on the Greek island of Poros, after falling from a cliff while scouting locations for a film about health services in Europe. He was buried in the protestant cemetery in Athens.<br>
