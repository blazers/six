<span class="headword">Hadland,  Selina</span>  (1838&#150;1919), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 18 February 1838 at 34 Holborn Hill, London, the daughter of Henry Hadland, a cheesemonger and one-time keeper of the Guildhall, and his wife, Sarah Ann Hadland <i>n&eacute;e</i> Matthews. Little is known of her early life and education. In her twenties she taught in private schools in London, moving to Malvernbury, Great Malvern, in 1871, to a school whose headmistress, Miss Cooper, she much admired.<br>
<br>In 1873 Selina Hadland applied for the position of lady principal of the new Milton Mount College, at Milton, Gravesend, Kent, which was being established for the education of the daughters of Congregational ministers, under the leadership of the Revd William Guest (1818&#150;1891) and a committee of management of leading Congregationalists. The term &#145;college&#146; was used because the new institution was intended for the training of teachers as well as for the education of schoolgirls. Her application was supported by both Newman Hall and C. H. Spurgeon, and she was selected by the governors from fifty-eight candidates. At the opening of the college in May 1873 many of the pioneers of women's education were present, and Emily Davies was among the speakers.<br>
<br>During the following sixteen years as principal Selina Hadland proved herself a pioneer of courage, ability, vigour, foresight, and religious faith. Her courage was shown in her struggle with some of the governors for appropriate authority within the school, at a time when many regarded women as incapable of public management. In these struggles she was well supported by her friends Dorothea Beale and Frances Mary Buss, and by others who were facing the same problems. Her administrative ability was amply demonstrated, not only in her running of the school, but as one of the first nine members of the Association of Headmistresses (of which she was the second vice-president, elected in 1880) and as one of the founders, and first honorary secretary, of the Teachers' Guild. In 1875 the annual conference of the Association of Headmistresses was held at Milton Mount.<br>
<br>By the time Selina Hadland resigned from Milton Mount in 1889, and largely due to her initiative, there was attached to the college not only a training section for teachers but also a high school&#151;the first technical school for girls in England&#151;where the trainee teachers were given practical experience. The school itself had grown, and a new wing had been built to accommodate more pupils. Milton Mount was one of the first girls' schools to have a gymnasium, to gain recognition as a school of art, and to require practical work in every scientific subject. The academic standards had steadily improved, due in part to the many well-qualified teachers who travelled down regularly from London, and almost from the beginning the girls were prepared for the Cambridge local examinations.<br>
<br>Selina Hadland's foresight was demonstrated in her concern for employment and public roles for women of all classes, with a particular emphasis on technical education. She wrote on <span class="italic">Occupations of Women other than Teaching</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Technical Education for Girls and Women</span> (1891). She believed that women should be able to earn their own livelihoods if necessary, and, though reserved about women's suffrage, favoured their participation in local government.<br>
<br>After her resignation, Selina Hadland moved with her sister, Ellen (who had helped her with domestic arrangements at Milton Mount), first to Hampton Hill, Middlesex, then in 1898 to St Leonards, in Sussex. Their home was a centre of generous hospitality for old pupils and others. An inheritance from their father enabled Selina Hadland to offer public service in a variety of fields for another twenty years. In 1893 she and her sister visited the United States and Canada in order to study schools, colleges, and technical institutions, particularly those which had their origin in Congregational traditions, and she subsequently published <span class="italic">Education and Life in the United States</span> (1895). She served as one of the first governors of the new Battersea Polytechnic, on the committee of the Canning Town Women's Settlement (of which she was one of the founders), as a member of the Kingston board of guardians, and as a manager of a primary school. She was also active in Free Church Sunday schools and on the local Free Church Council. During all this time, she kept in touch with her former pupils, often gathering holiday parties in Switzerland, and paying herself for those unable to afford the cost.<br>
<br>Selina Hadland died on 17 November 1919 at her home, Miltolino, 2 Combermere Road, St Leonards; and her funeral, attended by a large congregation, was held at Christ Church, Westminster Bridge Road, London, four days later, followed by burial in Nunhead cemetery.<br>
