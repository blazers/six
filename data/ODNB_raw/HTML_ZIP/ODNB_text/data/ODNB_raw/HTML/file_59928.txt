<span class="headword">Bennis <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Patten]</span>,  Eliza</span>  (1725&#150;1802), <span class="occ">Methodist leader</span>, was born in Limerick. Little is known of her background except that her family were Presbyterian and that her father died when she was eighteen. Two years later she married Mitchell Bennis (<i>d</i>. 1788), who in 1769 was master of the corporation of Saddlers. The marriage was apparently a happy one: her husband was described as a &#145;tender and affectionate partner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Correspondence</span>, 244) and Bennis, following her spiritual conversion, worried that her husband and children were &#145;idols set up in &hellip; the place that God should have&#146;  (ibid., 285).<br>
<br>For much of her early life Bennis was troubled by a sense of spiritual emptiness: &#145;I saw I was not right&#146;, she remembered, &#145;yet thought that I was not as bad as many&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Correspondence</span>, 266). When Robert Swindells, the first Methodist missionary to visit Limerick, preached there on 17 March 1749, she went to hear him. She was &#145;much affected&#146;  (ibid., 267) and shortly afterwards became the first member of the Methodist society in the city. Although she continued for some years to be troubled by &#145;unbelief&#146;  (ibid., 282) and by self-doubt, her conversion marked the beginning of a wholehearted and energetic commitment to the consolidation and expansion of Methodism.<br>
<br>As a member of the local congregation Bennis took charge of class and band meetings and ultimately assumed a leadership role within the society. In 1769 she successfully petitioned the Methodist conference for the appointment of a preacher to Limerick&#151;the earliest example, according to C. H. Crookshank, &#145;of the voice of the people being heard in connection with a preaching appointment&#146;  (Crookshank, <span class="italic">History of Methodism</span>, 229). Under her supervision, the society in Limerick flourished: in 1772 she reported that<blockquote>the select band in particular, and the society in general, are much stirred up &hellip; the class-meetings are lively; the prayer meetings &hellip; are revived; the public congregation is in general much larger, and a deeper seriousness and spirit of enquiry observable. (<span class="italic">Christian Correspondence</span>, 55)</blockquote>From 1768 Bennis spent much of her time in Waterford, involving herself in the affairs of the society there. In 1770 she informed Wesley that &#145;the people here go on at a poor rate, nor do I think it likely to be otherwise until they have a stationed preacher; they desired me to mention this, and would thank you to think of them&#146;  (Crookshank, <span class="italic">History of Methodism</span>, 237). Wesley acceded to her request and in 1772 acknowledged her success in building up the society in Waterford, going on to commission her to re-establish order in Limerick, where the society was currently in disarray. She continued to report to Wesley on the state of Methodism in Waterford and Limerick, interesting herself not only in spiritual questions but also in more practical matters: noting that a wealthy Mr T&#151; had joined the Waterford society, she remarked that &#145;God does graciously throw in a rich person here and there, to bear the needful expenses of his poor followers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Correspondence</span>, 55).<br>
<br>Bennis's incessant zeal and ability to inspire are suggested by the Methodist preacher John McGregor, who, recalling their association in Limerick, described her as his &#145;golden spur&#146;, and asked,<blockquote>Whose parlour can I now turn into a study? What woman will throw away her work, to meditate and converse with me on the things of God? &hellip; Who will now counsel, instruct, or admonish me? &hellip; Who will thrust me into the jail, among the malefactors; to the barracks, amongst the soldiers; to sick beds, and distressed souls? This have you often done, when I was able, but not always willing. (<span class="italic">Christian Correspondence</span>, 245)</blockquote>In 1773 Bennis had rejoiced that &#145;the Lord has blessed my husband's industry far above our expectation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Correspondence</span>, 76), but some unspecified &#145;trials&#146;  (ibid., 297) resulted in a decline in the family's fortunes and led her and her husband to leave Limerick for Waterford. Widowed in 1788, Bennis later emigrated with her family to Philadelphia, where she died in June 1802.<br>
