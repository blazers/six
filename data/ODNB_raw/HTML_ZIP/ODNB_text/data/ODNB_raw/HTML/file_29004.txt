<span class="headword">Wellesley <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Wesley]</span>,  Henry</span>, first Baron Cowley  (1773&#150;1847), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born at Dangan Castle, co. Meath, on 20 January 1773, was the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29002/', "Garrett Wesley, first earl of Mornington (1735&#150;1781)")</script>, and Anne (1742&#150;1831), daughter of Arthur Hill, first Viscount Dungannon. He was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29008/', "Richard Wellesley, Marquess Wellesley")</script>, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29001/', "Arthur Wellesley, duke of Wellington")</script>, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29010/', "William Wellesley-Pole, Baron Maryborough (afterwards third earl of Mornington)")</script>. After being educated at Eton College (1783&#150;9) and then studying languages and military science at the court of Brunswick in Germany (1789&#150;90), he served in the army, where he exchanged from the 40th foot into the 1st foot guards in April 1791. He adopted the surname Wellesley some time after his eldest brother did so in 1789.<br>
<br>Wellesley's diplomatic career began with his appointment in 1791 as attach&eacute; to the British embassy at The Hague. The following year he went to Stockholm as secretary of legation. The year 1793 found him with his regiment in Flanders; it would prove to be his first and last encounter with military life. In February 1794 he left for Lisbon to accompany his sister Anne, recently widowed, to Britain. On the return trip their ship was seized by the French and passengers and crew were taken as prisoners of war, just as the terror entered its most violent stage. In January 1795, after Anne's release, Wellesley contrived his escape. He reached Britain's shores only after a harrowing crossing in which three men died. The experience confirmed the Wellesley family's antipathy for revolutionary France.<br>
<br>Wellesley subsequently was given a post in the Foreign Office as a pr&eacute;cis writer and in July 1797 he accompanied Lord Malmesbury to Lille as his secretary. In November of the same year he sailed for India as private secretary to his brother, then Lord Mornington, afterwards Marquess Wellesley, the newly appointed governor-general. While in India, Henry Wellesley rendered important special services. Together with his brother Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards duke of Wellington), he acted as one of the commissioners for the settlement of Mysore after the defeat of Tipu Sultan. He was then dispatched to Britain to provide a firsthand account of the war and the treaties that concluded it. Lord Wellesley described him as &#145;next to himself most completely informed on these topics&#146;. Henry Wellesley left India on 15 August 1799, and returned in February 1801. Soon after he was sent to Lucknow to negotiate a treaty requiring the vizier of Oudh to cede territory sufficient to defray the cost of the increased subsidized force dispatched to Oudh by the governor-general, and to act in conformity with the East India Company's instructions. On the treaty's conclusion Wellesley was appointed governor of the ceded territory. The court of directors of the company, though acknowledging his services, objected to the appointment because Wellesley was not a member of the service. They revoked the appointment but were subsequently overruled by the Board of Control, who pointed out that the Oudh mission was an extraordinary service, and that Wellesley had declined all emoluments except his salary as private secretary to the governor-general. He resigned the governorship in March 1802, and returned to Europe. The following November the directors wrote to the governor-general a full acknowledgement of his brother's services in Oudh. Wellesley's years in India were not without controversy. On Lord Wellesley's return to Britain an attack on his governor-generalship was launched in parliament and Henry Wellesley's work was scrutinized along with the marquess's; though the inquiry lingered longer than expected, the brothers emerged with their reputations intact.<br>
<br>On 20 September 1803 Wellesley married Charlotte Sloane (<i>c</i>. 1781&#150;1853), daughter of Charles Sloane, first Earl Cadogan. Together they had four children, three sons and a daughter. The eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29006/', "Henry Richard Charles Wellesley, second Baron and first Earl Cowley")</script>, is separately noticed, as is the third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29003/', "Gerald Valerian Wellesley")</script>. The second son, William Henry George, served as a captain in the Royal Navy. The daughter, Charlotte Arbuthnot, married Robert Grosvenor, first Lord Ebury. Wellesley was appointed a lord of the Treasury in 1804, a post he shortly afterwards resigned to take up an appointment as envoy to Spain. The outbreak of war with Spain prevented his going out and left him without employment. Subsequently, he was returned to parliament for Eye on 20 April 1808 and again appointed to the Treasury. In 1809 his marriage with Charlotte Sloane broke up in scandalous fashion, when Charlotte ran off with Henry Paget, the future first marquess of Anglesey. Wellesley was divorced by act of parliament on 22 February 1810, after an action for criminal conversation, in which he received &pound;20,000 from Paget, who married Charlotte that same year. The event had two important consequences: Wellesley again resigned from the Treasury, and his brother Arthur refused to employ Paget in the Peninsular War, where cavalry officers of his calibre were much in demand.<br>
<br>In December 1809 Wellesley was again appointed envoy to Spain, this time by his brother the marquess, who had taken up the seals of office as foreign secretary. Accordingly, Wellesley was sworn of the privy council on 20 December 1809 and received his credentials as envoy-extraordinary on 3 January 1810. His appointment to the Spanish embassy put in place the remarkable arrangement whereby one family controlled the central places in Great Britain's prosecution of the war in Iberia: Arthur as commander-in-chief of the expeditionary forces, Richard as foreign secretary, and Henry as envoy and then (from 1 October 1811) ambassador to Spain. Together they worked to sustain the war effort throughout its most difficult stage. In 1812 Wellesley was knighted, and in January 1815 created GCB. In 1814 he prevailed upon the king of Spain to sign a treaty relinquishing for ever the scheme of a Bourbon alliance. After the peace he concluded a treaty with Spain containing an article by which Anglo-Spanish commercial relations were restored to those of 1796. In August 1815 he left Spain for Britain on leave. It was then that he married on 27 February 1816 his second wife, Georgiana Charlotte Augusta Cecil (1786&#150;1860), eldest daughter of James Cecil, first marquess of Salisbury. Their only child, Georgiana Charlotte Mary, married William Henry Lytton Earle Bulwer, Baron Dalling and Bulwer. On his return to Spain, Wellesley negotiated in 1817 a treaty abolishing the slave trade.<br>
<br>Wellesley left Spain in April 1821 and on 3 February 1823 was named ambassador at Vienna. He remained in Austria for eight years. In August 1827 he told Wellington that he thought he had more than once prevented a rupture between Britain and Austria. But he complained that Canning never recognized his services. Although the two had known one another for years, and Canning had even asked Wellesley to be his second in the infamous duel with Lord Castlereagh, Wellesley was too conciliatory to please his aggressive minister.<br>
<br>In 1827 Wellington approached Canning's successor, Lord Goderich, concerning a peerage for his brother and on 21 January 1828 Wellesley was created a peer, with the title of Baron Cowley of Wellesley. On Palmerston's appointment to the Foreign Office at the end of 1830, Cowley offered to resign, and in July 1831 he left Vienna. On 13 March 1835 he was named ambassador at Paris by Peel's tory government, but he retired in May when the whigs returned to office.<br>
<br>Cowley was reappointed by Peel in October 1841. The appointment was unexpected in that the new ambassador was sixty-eight years old and there were those who questioned both his stamina and his hearing. None the less, Cowley presided successfully over the embassy in Paris until his resignation in August 1846 after the tories went out of office.<br>
<br>A handsome man of average height and build, Cowley possessed a gentle disposition which made him the most endearing of the Wellesley brothers. Metternich, the Austrian chancellor, characterized Cowley as a straightforward man with an eye for affairs. He lacked the brilliance of his brothers the marquess and the duke, but he was steady and sensible. He died in Paris on 27 April 1847. He was buried in Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street, London. Lady Cowley died at Hatfield House on 18 January 1860.<br>
