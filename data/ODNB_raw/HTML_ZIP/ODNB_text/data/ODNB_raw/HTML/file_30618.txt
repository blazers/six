<span class="headword">Barrington,  Rutland</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>George Rutland Barrington Fleet]</span>  (1853&#150;1922), <span class="occ">actor and singer</span>, was born at Penge, Surrey, on 15 January 1853. He was the fourth son of John George Fleet, a wholesale sugar dealer in Fenchurch Street, London, and his wife, Esther, the daughter of the Revd Ferdinand Faithfull, rector of Headley, near Epsom. He was educated at first by a private tutor, then at Headley rectory, and thereafter at Merchant Taylors' School, London, and, on leaving, entered business in the City, where he remained until he was twenty-one. His aunt, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37409/', "Emily Faithfull")</script>, was a well-known dramatic reader, and she was instrumental in obtaining his first engagement with the actor Henry Neville. He made his first appearance on the stage at the Olympic Theatre on 1 September 1874 as Sir George Barclay in <span class="italic">Lady Clancarty</span> by Tom Taylor. In the following year he went on tour with Mrs Howard Paul, and he remained with her when she obtained an engagement with Richard D'Oyly Carte and insisted that Barrington should be engaged also.<br>
<br>Barrington made his d&eacute;but under D'Oyly Carte's management at the Opera Comique on 17 November 1877, when he took the part of Dr Daly in <span class="italic">The Sorcerer</span> by Gilbert and Sullivan, and had an immediate success. This first engagement with D'Oyly Carte lasted for eleven years, first at the Opera Comique and later at the Savoy, during which period he played many original parts in Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including Captain Corcoran in <span class="italic">HMS Pinafore</span> (May 1878), Archibald Grosvenor in <span class="italic">Patience</span> (April 1881), and King Hildebrand in <span class="italic">Princess Ida</span> (January 1884). Most important of his original roles was Pooh-Bah in <span class="italic">The Mikado</span> (March 1885), after which he was even given the affectionate nickname of Pooh-Bah by many of his admirers.<br>
<br>After quitting the Savoy, Barrington managed the St James's Theatre, and opened on 13 October 1888 with <span class="italic">The Dean's Daughter</span> by Sydney Grundy and F. C. Phillips, which was followed by Gilbert's <span class="italic">Brantinghame Hall</span>; but both plays proved unsuccessful, and Barrington was forced into bankruptcy.<br>
<br>For a short period Barrington played at the Comedy Theatre under Charles Hawtrey, but he returned to the Savoy, under D'Oyly Carte, in December 1889 in order to play the part of Giuseppe in Gilbert and Sullivan's <span class="italic">The Gondoliers</span>. This second engagement at the Savoy covered a period of four and a half years (1889&#150;94), in the course of which he appeared in <span class="italic">The Nautch Girl</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Vicar of Bray</span> (1892), <span class="italic">Haddon Hall</span> (1892), <span class="italic">Jane Annie</span> (1893), and <span class="italic">Utopia Unlimited</span> (1893). In 1894 he joined George Edwardes's company in order to play Dr Brierley in <span class="italic">A Gaiety Girl</span> on tour and at Daly's Theatre. After a few other engagements, including an appearance at the Savoy as Ludwig in the last Gilbert and Sullivan opera, <span class="italic">The Grand Duke</span> (1896), he became increasingly absorbed by musical comedy rather than comic opera and returned to Daly's, where he remained from 1896 to 1904, playing in <span class="italic">The Geisha</span>, <span class="italic">A Greek Slave</span>, <span class="italic">San Toy</span>, <span class="italic">A Country Girl</span>, and <span class="italic">The Cingalee</span>.<br>
<br>Thereafter, beyond appearing in <span class="italic">Am&#257;sis</span> (1906), <span class="italic">The Girl in the Train</span> (1910), and in occasional revivals at Daly's and the Savoy, Barrington received only minor engagements at various theatres and music-halls. From 1916 to 1918 he was engaged with John Martin-Harvey. With that manager he played his last part, that of Claus in Maurice Maeterlinck's <span class="italic">The Burgomaster of Stilemonde</span> at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, in October 1918. In the following January he had a paralytic seizure, but he lingered on, in very straitened circumstances, for a few years. A benefit performance was given for him at the Savoy Theatre in February 1921, and in April 1922 he was elected an annuitant of King George's pension fund for actors. He died on 1 June 1922 at St James's Infirmary, Wandsworth Common.<br>
<br>Barrington was the author of a play, <span class="italic">Bartonmere Towers</span> (1893), a version of Kingsley's <span class="italic">The Water Babies</span>, and of two volumes of autobiography (1908, 1911). He also contributed to <span class="italic">Punch</span>, writing as Lady Gay. He had considerable skill as a watercolourist. In his time Barrington was a man of considerable importance in the theatre, with a fine figure, an abundant sense of humour, and a soft though penetrating voice. The tradition he left in the parts which he created at the Savoy and Daly's long survived him.<br>
