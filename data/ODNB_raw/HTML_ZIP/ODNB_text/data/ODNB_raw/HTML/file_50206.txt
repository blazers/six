<span class="headword">Mason, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1844&#150;1924), <span class="occ">civil engineering contractor</span>, was born in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, Scotland, the son of John Mason, builder, and his wife, Marion Hamilton. He was educated at Anderson's University, Glasgow, before starting an apprenticeship as a mason. In 1861 he moved to Edinburgh, where he was mainly involved with railway works, both as a mason and as a subcontractor. After six years in Edinburgh, Mason was taken on as foreman mason by the contractor James Brand, and put in charge of the building of the Ayr Viaduct for the Glasgow and South Western Railway. He worked for Brand until 1875, in charge of his tramway contracts, including one for the Govan and Greenock Tramway Company.<br>
<br>In 1875 Mason won a contract for the building of the Stobcross docks (later the Queen's docks) in Glasgow, and shortly after this he joined the building firm John Morrison &amp; Co., with the job of tendering for and managing future contracts at Queen's Dock. The name of the company was changed to Morrison and Mason in 1879. During the 1880s the firm began to win railway contracts, including the building of the first section of the Cathcart Circle, a local railway on the south side of Glasgow, in 1884&#150;6, and the Paisley Canal branch line of the Glasgow and South Western Railway. They also built the Citadel Station at Carlisle. Morrison and Mason branched out into waterworks with the construction of the Thirlmere Reservoir for Manchester corporation, and a joint contract with the structural engineer William Arrol for 26 miles of aqueducts in connection with the Thirlmere waterworks. The company also tendered for public building contracts, building offices for the Clyde Navigation Trust in Glasgow in 1883&#150;6, and the municipal buildings for Glasgow corporation in 1883&#150;8.<br>
<br>The firm became a limited company, Morrison and Mason Ltd, in 1889, with capital of &pound;100,000: Morrison was chairman. While continuing to build reservoirs, such as those at Criagmaddie for the Glasgow waterworks, in 1893&#150;4, the company began to build bridges, including the Great Western Bridge in 1890, the Glasgow Bridge in 1895, and the Rutherglen Bridge in 1896. They also continued to build offices, with new offices for the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> completed in 1910, and won contracts for hospitals, including the Ruchill Fever Hospital, finished in 1900. Morrison and Mason Ltd undertook major dock-building projects on the Clyde, notably a new dock at Clydebank, and work for Arrol on the new dockyard for Yarrows at Scotstoun in 1907. As the European powers built up their navies in preparation for war, the company won lucrative Admiralty contracts, including in 1907 one of &pound;1 million to build lock gates at the entrance to Portsmouth naval dockyard, and a &pound;0.5 million contract for a dock for battleships, also at Portsmouth. During the First World War the company was mainly engaged in building harbour defences.<br>
<br>Mason, a Liberal, was elected to Glasgow town council in 1891, and represented the city on the board of the Clyde Navigation Trust. After he left office he remained on the board as a representative of the Merchant's House. As chairman from 1908 to 1919 he was involved in the deepening and widening of the river, and also the construction of the Rothesay Dock at Clydebank and the installation of hydraulic power at Princes Dock. While he was on the board the tonnage of shipping using the Clyde doubled, from 7 million to 14 million tons. Mason was knighted in 1909. Following the death of John Morrison in 1919, Mason sold the company to Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. He was a director and chairman of Arrols, and the two companies had collaborated on many projects from 1876 onwards, when Morrison and Mason worked for Arrol on a bridge over the Clyde for the Caledonian Railway.<br>
<br>Mason was married twice; first to Jeanie Paton, and second to Charlotte Wyllie. He had two sons and three daughters. At one point he owned a small stable of racehorses, and he continued to own racehorses at Newmarket. He died on 26 April 1924 at his home on the south side of Glasgow, Craigie Hall, 6/8 Rowan Road, Bellahouston, survived by his second wife.<br>
