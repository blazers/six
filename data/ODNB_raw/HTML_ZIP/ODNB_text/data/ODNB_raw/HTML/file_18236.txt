<span class="headword">Martyn,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1483), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's</span>, is first recorded in 1448, when he supplicated as bachelor of canon law, at Oxford; he had incepted in canon law by 1478. He served as chaplain to John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1470), from 1458 until at least 1464. He subsequently passed into the service of the crown, and the archdeaconry of London in 1469, and prebends in St Paul's, London, and St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, both in 1471, may have been among his early rewards.<br>
<br>Among the complaints against Edward IV in 1469 was the king's inability to command the regular services of a body of lords. The deficiency was made up by the appointment of professional men retained by annuities, while the title of counsellor was extended to more than a score of doctors of law. Martyn, who had become a chancery clerk, was prominent among these. In May 1471 he arranged the funeral of Henry VI at Chertsey Abbey, and in February 1472 was appointed one of the tutors and counsellors of Edward, prince of Wales. He served as a master of chancery from 1472 to 1478, and was a member of the king's council and royal chaplain by 1478.<br>
<br>Martyn was also a diplomat, closely associated with Edward IV's tortuous foreign policy. He was one of the commissioners to treat for peace with Scotland in August 1471, and to treat with the ambassadors of Burgundy about the handing over of Henry Tudor, earl of Richmond, in March 1472. In 1475, during Edward IV's invasion of France, Martyn was employed in unsuccessful negotiations with Duke Charles of Burgundy, failing to persuade the duke to raise the siege of Neuss and come to Edward's aid. In March 1477 he treated with King Ferdinand of Aragon (<i>r</i>. 1479&#150;1516) for the marriage of the latter's daughter, Isabella, to Edward, prince of Wales, and requested Ferdinand and his wife, Isabella of Castile (<i>r</i>. 1474&#150;1516), to send an embassy to England. Thereafter he acted as an intermediary between Edward IV and Louis XI of France (<i>r</i>. 1461&#150;83). In 1480 he was one of a large embassy sent to treat with Louis for the pension he had agreed to pay Edward in 1475. At a secret meeting the dispute between Louis XI and the Flemings was discussed, and also Edward's wish to arbitrate between Louis and the emperor's son, Maximilian of Austria. While this was going on Edward, presumably without Martyn's knowledge, was negotiating a marriage between the prince of Wales and Anne, daughter of the duke of Brittany, which was intended as a prelude to the invasion of France.<br>
<br>Martyn had more success applying Edward's domestic policies after 1471, being associated with the king's collection of revenues. The &#145;benevolences&#146; by which Edward sought to raise money for his invasion of France of 1475 raised &pound;22,000, and a letter survives commissioning Richard Martyn &#145;our counsellor to go to London t'exite and induce by all reason that you can or may make to us good and loving grants&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 980, art. 23). Martyn was also involved in Edward IV's efforts to enforce law and order in his second reign, and was appointed to a number of commissions of the peace in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Worcestershire between February 1473 and May 1474, along with Richard, duke of Gloucester, Anthony Woodville, Lord Rivers, and George, duke of Clarence. He was appointed chancellor of Ireland in February 1478, but may not have taken up office.<br>
<br>Martyn was closely identified with the advance of the Woodvilles in Wales at the expense of the Herberts. He was appointed chancellor of the earldom of March for life in 1471, and on 26 February 1482 was nominated by the king for the bishopric of St David's. Papal provision followed on 26 April, and the temporalities were restored on 1 July. During his brief episcopate Martyn seems to have had little to do with his diocese, which he claimed to have found impoverished and heavily in debt. By 1478 he had become archdeacon of Hereford, and he was allowed to keep this and other benefices, to the value of 300 florins, nominally to allow him to repair dilapidated buildings at St David's. But there is no evidence that he actually financed any works. He died in 1483, probably on 25 March, and perhaps in London, since he was buried not in his own cathedral but in St Paul's Cathedral, by the crucifix near the north door. He endowed a yearly exhibition for the choristers to sing before this crucifix. His obit was observed in Christ Church Cathedral priory, Canterbury, to which he left his mitre and crozier.<br>
