<span class="headword">Lyle,  Robert</span>, first Lord Lyle  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1470), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, came of the family of Lyle of Duchal in Renfrewshire. The family's rise to prominence in national politics had been begun by Robert's father (also Robert), who served as a hostage for James I in 1424, when the value of the Lyle estates was assessed at &pound;200 Scots per year. The younger Robert Lyle harboured ambitions, in alliance with his brother-in-law Robert, Lord Erskine, to half the lands of the earldom of Mar, by right of his descent from a younger coheir of Isabel, countess of Mar; he pursued this claim, albeit unsuccessfully, in the 1440s, during the turmoil of James II's minority. It is not clear when Lyle succeeded his father, but he had done so by 1445, when he was styled lord of Duchal.<br>
<br>Lyle married a daughter of Andrew, Lord Gray, and it was probably through Gray's influence that he achieved a rise in status, which resulted in his being elevated to the peerage in 1452. His promotion certainly seems bound up with the king's conflict with the Black Douglases, since Gray is named as one of the men who took part, alongside James II, in the killing of the eighth earl of Douglas on 22 February in that year and he may have recommended Lyle as a loyal man in the potentially troublesome south-west of Scotland. That Lyle was with the king's army in the field on 18 July 1452, during the summer campaign waged against Douglas supporters, would have emphasized his loyalty. His career thereafter is rather more obscure, but he is a frequent witness to royal charters in James III's minority. He died <i>c</i>.1470.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17249"></a><span class="headword">Robert Lyle</span>, second Lord Lyle  (<em>d.</em> 1497)<span class="occ"></span>, was the son of the first Lord Lyle and his second wife, Margaret Wallace. He succeeded his father even though he appears to have had an older brother, Alexander, who was described as the son and heir of Robert, Lord Lyle, in a bond made by Robert, Lord Boyd, in January 1466; Alexander must have predeceased the first Lord Lyle. By March 1472 the younger Robert Lyle had been appointed an ambassador to England. He may have established contact with the exiled James, ninth earl of Douglas, for on 22 March 1482 he went on trial before a parliamentary assize, charged with treasonably corresponding with the outlawed earl. Lyle was acquitted, no doubt owing to the king's influence. The importance of the trial of a notably loyal supporter of James III on remarkably insubstantial charges (Douglas did not even accompany the invading English army later in 1482) lies in the evidence it provides for opposition to James III and his more powerful supporters at this time.<br>
<br>Lyle resumed his diplomatic career almost immediately, taking part in several embassies to the English court, one of which, in 1484, was to conclude a treaty whereby a marriage was arranged between Prince James and Anne de la Pole, daughter of the duke of Suffolk and niece of Richard III. Although the marriage never took place, owing to the death of Richard III at Bosworth in 1485, the treaty may indicate the position of influence which Lyle had built up with the English king.<br>
<br>Lyle's hopes for advancement in the late 1480s were blocked by the return from exile before 1488 of the earl of Buchan. When Buchan was outlawed in 1485, Lyle acquired some of the earl's Angus lands, and probably hoped to secure further rewards for his loyal service. Buchan's reinstatement in favour with James III may have been instrumental in turning Lyle from loyal king's man to rebel. In 1488 he was at the January parliament held in Edinburgh, where he was proposed as a royal justiciar, but in April he was appointed to negotiate with the king on behalf of the Scottish nobles who were now in rebellion against James III. Lyle was named in the proposed settlement, known as the Aberdeen articles, as one of those commissioned by Prince James to negotiate with the king for the rebels, and Lyle's grievances against Buchan are mentioned specifically.<br>
<br>Lyle was almost certainly present at the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488, when James III was killed, and he was at Edinburgh a few days later, involved in drawing up an inventory of the royal treasure. On 23 June, the day before James IV's coronation at Scone, Lyle was at work there drafting another inventory, and he secured the position of justiciar of Bute and Arran in July 1488. He was one of those who sat in judgement on Buchan when the latter was tried for treason on 8 October 1488, although he cannot have been happy about the pardon granted to his old adversary. In the same parliament he received extensive powers in criminal jurisdiction in his home area of Renfrewshire, along with John Stewart, earl of Lennox, and Stewart's brother, Matthew, and it was with these men that Lyle was to go into open revolt against the government in the summer of 1489.<br>
<br>Lyle probably resented his exclusion from a government which was now dominated by the Hepburns and the choice of Lord Drummond, in preference to himself, as royal justiciar for the justice ayre in the south-west in February and March 1489; he may also have had suspicions concerning the apparent disappearance of part of the royal treasure for which he had prepared inventories in June 1488. The Lyle&#150;Lennox alliance held the castles of Duchal, Crookston, and Dumbarton, and it was the alleged abuse of their judicial powers, particularly towards the Semples in Renfrewshire, that precipitated a response from the government, fearful that the rebellion would spread. Some of Lyle's Angus lands were granted to the earl of Buchan even before Lyle's forfeiture in July 1489, and a reward of &pound;40 Scots in land was offered for Lyle's apprehension.<br>
<br>On 11 October 1489 the rebels were defeated at the battle of the Field of the Moss, but James IV was nevertheless compelled to consult with the three estates and to reach a settlement with the rebels. The parliament held in February 1490 proceeded to annul the forfeitures passed the previous summer against the Lennox Stewarts and Lyle, who were present to hear the king declare their forfeitures null and void and order the original processes to be removed from the parliamentary records. Lyle resumed his position as justiciar, was appointed ambassador to the Spanish court on 26 February 1491, and was one of the auditors of the exchequer in 1492. He died in 1497. He was married to Margaret Houston, and their son, Robert, became third Lord Lyle.<br>
