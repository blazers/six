<span class="headword">Bouverie,  Edward  Pleydell-</span>  (1818&#150;1889), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3018/', "William Pleydell-Bouverie, third earl of Radnor (1779&#150;1869)")</script>, and his second wife, Anne Judith (1790&#150;1851), third daughter of Sir Henry St John Mildmay, bt, was born on 26 April 1818. Educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, he graduated MA in 1838, and became a pr&eacute;cis writer to Lord Palmerston at the Foreign Office from January to June 1840. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 27 January 1843, and in the following year he was returned to parliament as Liberal member for Kilmarnock, sitting until his defeat there in 1874. He was a prominent figure in the House of Commons. From July 1850 to March 1852 he was under-secretary of state for the Home department in Lord John Russell's administration, and from April 1853 to March 1855 he was chairman of committees, while Lord Aberdeen was prime minister. In March 1855, when Palmerston became premier, Bouverie was made vice-president of the Board of Trade, and in August was transferred to the presidency of the poor-law board, a position he held until 1858. In 1857 he was appointed one of the committee of the council on education. He was second church estate commissioner from August 1859 to November 1865, and from 1869 he was one of the ecclesiastical commissioners for England. In 1862 he proposed in the Commons the abolition of tests for admission to fellowships in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Though a staunch Liberal, Bouverie belonged to the old whig school, and in his last parliament he often found himself unable to agree with Gladstone's policies. In 1872, when a charge of evasion of the law was made against Gladstone in connection with the appointment of W. W. Harvey to the rectory of Ewelme, Bouverie expressed regret &#145;that the prime minister should amuse his leisure hours by driving coaches-and-six through Acts of Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 209.1711).<br>
<br>When the <span class="roman">Irish University Bill</span> was introduced, Bouverie finally broke with Gladstone (March 1873). He denounced the measure as miserably bad and scandalously inadequate to its professed object. He voted against the second reading on 10 March, when the government was defeated. During the course of his career Bouverie addressed numerous letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> under the signature of &#145;E. P. B.&#146;, and subsequent to this occasion his letters to the newspaper continued his attacks on the measure and its framers. After his retirement from parliament he became in 1877 associated with the corporation of bondholders of the Egyptian and Turkish debt, and was soon made its chairman. Under his guidance the debts of many countries were readjusted; and the corporation's scheme for dealing with the Turkish debt was confirmed by the sultan's irade of January 1882. Bouverie was also director of the Great Western Railway Company and of the Peninsular and Oriental Company.<br>
<br>Bouverie married, on 1 November 1842, Elizabeth Anne, youngest daughter of General Robert Balfour of Balbirnie, Fife, and had two sons and three daughters. He died at his London home, 44 Wilton Crescent, on 16 December 1889.<br>
