<span class="headword">Fullarton,  Adam</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1595), <span class="occ">religious activist and civic administrator</span>, was born in Ayrshire into the family of Fullarton of Dreghorn. His family had links with the small group of Lollards of Kyle in the 1490s and was early converted to protestantism. Adam was either the brother or cousin of the protestant laird John Fullarton of Dreghorn, who subscribed the Ayr bond in 1562 and whose son became minister of Kilmaurs in 1589 and of Dreghorn in 1590. His mother was either Elizabeth Dalrymple or Helen Chalmers.<br>
<br>Adam Fullarton was admitted a burgess and guild of Edinburgh on 24 December 1549, though it is not clear if this was through the familiar route for outsiders of marriage into a prominent merchant family, since the origins of his wife, Marjorie Roger (<i>d</i>. 1583), are unknown. He first appeared on the town council in 1555&#150;6. Both he and his wife were significant figures in the capital's emerging &#145;privy kirk&#146; in the mid-1550s; she belonged to John Knox's &#145;dear sisters&#146; of Edinburgh, with whom he corresponded both before and after his brief visit to Scotland in 1555&#150;6, and her testament, drawn up in 1583, reveals a remarkable library of more than thirty books. It included English works by Cranmer and Hooper published during the reign of Edward VI, demonstrating the importance of English literature in nurturing urban protestantism in Scotland.<br>
<br>In July 1559, when the lords of the congregation reached the capital and John Knox was appointed minister of the burgh church of St Giles, Fullarton emerged as the spokesman for the &#145;haill brether of the congregatioun&#146; in the town, refusing the offer of a religious referendum made by the regent, Mary of Guise, on the grounds that &#145;God's truth should not be subject to the voting of men&#146;  (Marwick, 3.47&#150;8). He was appointed a bailie on the town council brought to power in October 1559 by a purge by the protestant lords, and became probably the most significant protestant layman in the capital during the period that Knox was minister of Edinburgh (1559&#150;72). He was on the council from 1559 to 1562, but like other militant protestants he lost office for much of the rest of the reign of Mary, queen of Scots; he regained office in 1567, during the regency of James Stewart, earl of Moray, and retained it until 1573. He became a bailie, dean of guild, and, briefly in the absence of the provost James MacGill, president of the burgh.<br>
<br>Fullarton's roots may help explain Knox's close links with Ayrshire during the 1560s, when he was appointed a visiting commissioner four times. The connections of both men with Ayrshire also help to explain the militancy of the capital's protestant party. It was a letter from the uncompromising brethren of Kyle urging the rooting out of the idolatry of the mass, which led to a house to house search through the capital for Roman Catholic worshippers during Lent 1565; this resulted in the show trial and ritual beating up of a former chaplain of St Giles and provoked a riot by the burgh's Catholics on Palm Sunday. On 9 March 1566&#151;the night on which Queen Mary's servant David Riccio was murdered&#151;Fullarton was one of twenty-one burgesses implicated in the killing of the queen's confessor, the Dominican friar John Black. The connection between the two deaths suggests that Fullarton had foreknowledge of both plots and saw them as a means for the radicals to regain control of the town council.<br>
<br>After 1567 Fullarton served as a burgh commissioner: to parliament, to the convention of royal burghs, and to the general assembly, attending the important meeting at Leith in January 1572. He was a dean of guild on the council of the king's party exiled to Leith by the rival queen's party in June 1571. At Leith he was elected captain of the exiles' Edinburgh band, which he helped to provision, and he also lent sizeable sums to the king's lords, little of which seem to have been repaid. The testament of his wife, who died in 1583, recorded almost &pound;1800 of outstanding debts owed by successive regents&#151;Moray, Lennox, and Mar. Fullarton's house was badly damaged during the year-long siege of the burgh (1571&#150;2), and a claim for &pound;3667 against unspecified persons for the spoiling of his goods and property remained unsettled at the time of his wife's death. Their joint estate was then recorded as amounting to &pound;10,717 Scots; however, all but &pound;441 was made up of unpaid debts, many of them unrecoverable. Fullarton himself was not among the merchant &eacute;lite&#151;he was consistently assessed outside the top 20 per cent of taxpayers.<br>
<br>In February 1575 Fullarton's close links with Regent Morton were rewarded by the grant of a lucrative twelve-year contract for the lead mines at Glengonner, near Leadhills in Lanarkshire, and in Orkney; Fullarton shared the contract with Morton's kinsman George, later known as Douglas of Parkhead. His long devotion to the &#145;amity&#146; with England, for which he claimed in 1584 to have worked &#145;nycht and day&#146;, brought him into contact with the highest reaches of Elizabeth's government: his &#145;verre good freindis&#146; included Bedford, Burghley, Hutton, Hunsdon, Killigrew, and Leicester  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 1584&#150;5, 285). In April 1560 he was sent on a secret mission to England.<br>
<br>In May 1577 Fullarton was appointed an emissary to pursue a series of actions by Scottish merchants against English pirates; the posting lasted over two years, proved largely fruitless, resulted in legal action against him by other Edinburgh merchants, and brought him considerable unpopularity. His uncompromising religious radicalism persisted into his last years. He suffered for his part in the welcome given to the radical minister John Durie, who had been critical of the royal court, on the latter's return to the town in September 1582, and he was himself exiled from the burgh after the Black Acts Parliament of May 1584 and incarcerated in Dumbarton Castle in August that year. By September 1585, however, when he was again sent to lobby Sir Francis Walsingham over the piracy cases, Fullarton seems to have been rehabilitated. A settlement was finally reached in December 1587. The last glimpse of Fullarton in the records comes on 23 June 1595, when his best wishes to Robert Bowes were passed on by an English agent in Edinburgh. His death is not recorded.<br>
