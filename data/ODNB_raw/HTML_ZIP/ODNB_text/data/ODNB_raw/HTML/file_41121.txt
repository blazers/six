<span class="headword">Mozeen <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Edwards]</span>,  Mary</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing names </em>Miss Edwards, Mrs Mozeen]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1724?, <em>d.</em> 1773?), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, was possibly Mary Edwards, daughter of the singer Thomas Edwards (1659?&#150;1730), a member of the king's musick, and his wife, Mary. If so, she would have been born by 18 June 1724, &#145;when Thomas Edwards drew his will and bequeathed &pound;1000 in trust for the benefit of his children Mary and Thomas&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 10.370).<br>
<br>Miss Edwards first appeared on stage on 19 November 1737 at the Drury Lane Theatre, as a &#145;country lass&#146; in the pantomime <span class="italic">The Burgomaster Trick'd</span>, performed by the Lilliputian Company. She then acted Margerina in <span class="italic">The Dragon of Wantley</span> and Glowworm in the pantomime <span class="italic">Robin Goodfellow</span> on various occasions during 1738, and quickly established herself as a prominent figure on the London stage. At first associated chiefly with Drury Lane, she played the Page in Thomas Arne's opera <span class="italic">Rosamond</span> on 8 March 1740. Kitty Clive, who had assisted and possibly taught Edwards during the early stages of her career, took the title role. Edwards sang at Clive's benefit on 17 March 1740 and appeared in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> the following May.<br>
<br>Later that year Miss Edwards began to perform at Lincoln's Inn Fields and became associated with Handel. She sang Clomiris in the premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Imeneo</span> (22 November) and Achilles in <span class="italic">Deidamia</span> (10 January 1741) and participated in various revivals. Her performances at Drury Lane during 1741&#150;3 were mainly at benefits for Mrs Clive, although she did appear as Juno in Arne's <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span> on 12 March 1742. Her association with Handel continued in 1743 at Covent Garden as one of the Philistine and Israelite women in the premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Samson</span> (18 February), and in the first London performance of <span class="italic">Messiah</span> (23 March). The parts written for her by Handel reveal a &#145;flexible light soprano&#146;  (Dean).<br>
<br>Miss Edwards continued to perform at Covent Garden as a singer and actress (she was Jessica in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> on 14 March 1744) and often collaborated with Mrs Clive. In addition there were appearances at the Crown and Anchor tavern in the Strand and at the Haymarket, and in 1745&#150;6 she returned to Drury Lane. Roles included Polly in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> and the goddess Hecate in Samuel Howard's <span class="italic">The Amorous Goddess</span> (25 April 1746), which was her last appearance as Miss Edwards. Shortly afterwards she married the Drury Lane actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19476/', "Thomas Mozeen (1720?&#150;1768)")</script> and was billed as Mrs Mozeen when playing Miranda in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> on 19 May 1746. Following a summer season at Jacob's Wells Theatre in Bristol (2 June&#150;5 September), the Mozeens returned to Drury Lane until May 1748, when Mrs Mozeen made her last London appearance as Peggy in <span class="italic">The King and the Miller of Mansfield</span> by Robert Dodsley. David Garrick having dispensed with their services, they were engaged by Thomas Sheridan at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin. Mrs Mozeen remained in Dublin for two seasons from autumn 1748. It appears that she and her husband separated towards the end of 1749: Thomas Mozeen appeared frequently in London from 1750 onwards, but Mrs Mozeen moved to and performed in Bath (1750&#150;54), followed by Belfast (1754&#150;8) and Edinburgh (1758&#150;65). She was acting in Norwich in 1767 and then returned to Ireland to perform in Belfast, Newry, Kilkenny, and Dublin between 1768 and 1773. Her son was acting in Belfast in September 1768.<br>
<br>Contemporary critical opinion held Mrs Mozeen in higher esteem as a singer than as an actress, in which capacity she was thought to be lacking confidence, conviction, and energy. It was also reported that she &#145;blushed at the least suggestive joke&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>), but had &#145;no very keen scruples&#146;  (ibid.) in private, to the extent that Mrs Clive withdrew her support. No details survive after 1773 and it is presumed that Mrs Mozeen died during that year.<br>
