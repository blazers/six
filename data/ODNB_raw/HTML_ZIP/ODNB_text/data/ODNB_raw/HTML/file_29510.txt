<span class="headword">Williams,  Henry</span>  (1792&#150;1867), <span class="occ">missionary in New Zealand</span>, was born at Nottingham on 11 February 1792, the fifth of nine children of Thomas Williams (1754&#150;1804), a prosperous hosier &#145;of good Welsh family&#146;, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marsh (1758&#150;1831). After the death of Thomas Williams from typhus, the well-educated Mary supplemented her income by running a school for young ladies at Southwell, Nottinghamshire, and her dissenting piety and strong character, together with the example of her three naval-officer brothers, are said to have been major influences on the young Henry.<br>
<br>In 1806 Henry Williams joined the Royal Navy. His career followed the normal pattern for officer cadets: first-class volunteer in 1806, at the age of fourteen; midshipman the following year; and lieutenant in 1815. He saw considerable active service against the Danes, the French, and the Americans, aboard the <i>Barfleur</i>, <i>Christian VII</i>, <i>Maida</i>, <i>Galatea</i>, <i>Race Horse</i>, <i>Saturn</i>, <i>Thames</i>, <i>Endymion</i>, and the USS <i>President</i>&#151;the last as a member of the prize crew after that frigate had been taken by <i>Endymion</i> in 1815. Earlier actions included the seizure of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen in 1806, and a clash between British and French frigate squadrons off Madagascar in 1810, in which Williams received a minor but persistently troublesome wound. A Maori version of Williams's war service included a personal encounter with Napoleon Bonaparte, in which the French emperor broke the young naval officer's glasses.<br>
<br>Williams was disbanded from the navy on half pay when the war ended in 1815. Apart from temporary employment as a drawing master, his interests increasingly focused on missionary work. Already an evangelical, nonconformist Christian by family background, his conversion to staunchly low-church Anglican and fully-fledged missionary was guided by his cousin Edward Garrard Marsh from about 1816. A member of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), Marsh gave Williams fair warning of the perils of his calling, but Williams remained determined and by 1819 had fully committed himself to the CMS. Marsh helped Williams to equip himself with the approved missionary outfit: training in medicine, boat building, and basket-making; ordination, in 1822; and marriage&#151;to Marianne Coldham (1793&#150;1879), Marsh's sister-in-law. Both families had lived in Nottingham; the marriage took place at Nuneham Courtenay, Oxfordshire, on 20 January 1818, and the newly-weds set up house in Cheltenham before moving to London. As was often the case, marriage, migration, and mission-work decisions went together for both parties. Although Marianne accepted the traditional subordination of wife to husband, it was always clear that she too was to be a missionary and, as for other evangelical women, God lent some autonomy. Unlike many women of the period, when she wrote of her &#145;Lord and master&#146; she did not mean her husband. Like Henry, she was energetic, capable, and tough. She bathed her children, put them to bed, and went for a walk immediately after the birth of the fourth of her eleven children. Both she and Henry were also accustomed to servants and aware of their own station in life. They were part of a widespread nineteenth-century attempt to reconcile godly work with middle-class standing. On 17 September 1822 this formidable pair of genteel but muscular Christians set sail from England, never to return.<br>
<br>The CMS had established a mission at the Bay of Islands, in Northland, New Zealand, in 1814, under the supervision of Samuel Marsden, Anglican chaplain of New South Wales. The Maori people were considered the perfect prospects for conversion, despite such peccadillos as cannibalism, and it was this particular mission &#145;field&#146; which had fascinated Henry Williams from the outset. After five months' final preparation at Marsden's base at Parramatta, Williams arrived at the Bay of Islands on 3 August 1823 to take over leadership of the New Zealand mission; he settled with his family at Paihia, which remained their home until 1850. After nine years, though it had expanded to three stations, the mission had made no conversions. It had faced severe difficulties, not least the threat of reverse conversion. The first leader, Thomas Kendall, had been dismissed for adultery with Maori women; the second, John Butler, was expelled for drunkenness; and a third senior missionary, William Yate, was eventually sacked for alleged sexual relations with between fifty and a hundred young Maori males. Over the next twenty years the apostolic labours of Henry Williams transformed and magnified the mission, gave it economic autonomy from its Maori hosts, established his personal prestige among the Maori, and led to their conversion to Christianity; it also brought peace to tribes embroiled in the bloody &#145;musket wars&#146;, and persuaded the Maori to accept British sovereignty in 1840. So, at least, runs the Williams legend, and separating out its kernel of truth is not easy.<br>
<br>Missionaries had busy pens, and their impact on the historical record tends greatly to exceed that on history itself. Yet Williams did not make all these claims, and left in his journals the means for refuting those who made them for him. The journals show, for example, that Williams's peacemaking efforts, while real and brave, were normally coupled with those of Maori peacemakers, who usually took the leading role. Both peace and Christianity did spread from around 1830, as did missionary autonomy, and Williams did contribute to all three developments. He systematized missionary training in the Maori language, helped by the increased availability of printed texts in that language from 1827, and by the arrival of his linguist brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29560/', "William Williams")</script>, in 1826. Henry Williams reversed Marsden's policy of &#145;civilize first, Christianize later&#146;, and so helped interlock Christianity with literacy and other desirable European arts in Maori minds, allowing them to act as &#145;Trojan horses&#146; for each other. Despite stubborn and intolerant strands in his personality, Williams did manage to weld the Anglican missionaries into an effective team, to travel and eventually to expand beyond the Bay of Islands in the 1830s, and to maintain a working alliance with the Wesleyans, though emphatically not with the Roman Catholic mission established in 1838. At the core of the Anglican team was the extended Williams family&#151;Henry, Marianne, William, William's wife, Jane, and their twenty children&#151;who practised a species of communal living and provided selective but massive hospitality to the chosen at Paihia.<br>
<br>But other factors were more important than Henry Williams in bringing increased autonomy to the missionaries and peace and Christianity to the Maori. One was the death in 1828 of the great mission-master and general in the musket wars, Hongi Hika, of the Ngapuhi tribe. Hongi's heirs competed to sponsor missionaries; rival Maori masters meant less mastery and an increasing willingness to permit the evangelizing of slaves and children, if not warriors and chiefs. From 1828 the missionaries and their religion were no longer seen as Hongi's creatures. Another factor was saturation in the gun trade. The musket wars began in 1818 because some tribes had muskets while others did not; they began to end, around 1830, because all tribes had muskets. Peacemaking occurred&#151;mostly without missionary mediation&#151;and it involved the release of prisoners, including the leading Maori Christian theologians of the day. It was these people, not European missionaries, who first took a form of Christianity to the Maori south of Northland. As mission stations spread south from about 1835, they found Christianity there before them. Again, this is evident from Williams's own journals, which have too often been read through hagiographic spectacles.<br>
<br>From 1837 Williams began to advocate official British intervention in New Zealand, hoping for a godly protectorate which would restrain the ungodly Europeans who were entering the country, impeding mission work, and allegedly visiting &#145;fatal impact&#146; upon the Maori. His wishes were fulfilled in 1840, when New Zealand became a nominal British colony and the treaty of Waitangi was signed by many Maori chiefs. Henry Williams and his son Edward translated the brief treaty into Maori, and by the late twentieth century were best remembered for this act, often unfavourably. It may well be true that Henry Williams bent the translation in a direction which made the Maori more likely to sign, believing that British sovereignty was now the only means of saving them from spiritual or even physical extinction. A bishop, long desired by Williams, soon followed the governor. George Augustus Selwyn arrived in 1842. Although Selwyn was a high-churchman, with what was unkindly described as an embryo tonsure, he and Williams appear initially to have co-operated well. Selwyn's shift from Paihia to Auckland in 1844 was prompted by CMS headquarters in London, not by Williams. Selwyn appointed Williams archdeacon of Waimate in the same year.<br>
<br>Between 1833 and 1837 Henry Williams had purchased some 11,000 acres of land from the Maori to provide for his numerous brood. The Maori appear to have accepted the sales, and the price paid (over &pound;1000 in goods) was high for the time, but so was the acreage. The CMS had authorized the buying of land by missionaries for their families, but it had not envisaged estate building on this scale. Criticism of Williams's land acquisitions began in 1840, and increased during the New Zealand War of 1845&#150;7 between the British and a section of the Ngapuhi, when it merged with false allegations of treason on Williams's part. The treason charge quickly collapsed; the charge of unscrupulous buying of land stuck, partly because Bishop Selwyn supported it, but largely through the efforts of the new governor, George Grey, who may have seen Williams as a rival for prestige among the Maori. The issue eventually resulted in Williams's dismissal from the CMS in 1849. He retired from Paihia to Pakaraka, the family estate, in 1850. Though he was reinstated by the CMS in 1854, and remained a locally important figure, his national influence ended. He died at Pakaraka on 16 July 1867 and was buried in the churchyard there. Marianne died on 16 September 1879.<br>
<br>Williams was a stoutly built man, more cheerful than his portraits suggest. Although his travails in New Zealand missionary work were epic, the privations can be exaggerated. His diet on a long evangelical journey in 1833 consisted of fresh bread, stewed eels, ducks, snipe, pigeon, fish, oysters, and cockles, and peach, plum, or gooseberry puddings, &#145;with a glass of wine, port or sherry as circumstances required&#146;. His achievements were also exaggerated, like those of the other New Zealand St Augustine, Marsden. His land dealings, though far from the machinations alleged by Grey, may not have been as innocent as his defenders claimed. His son Samuel Williams accumulated a fortune of at least &pound;479,566, and the Pakaraka estate might have been a kernel of this. Yet Henry Williams's self-abnegation generally is beyond dispute, as is his courage and energy. He was an important pioneer settler and churchman, and few Europeans did more to introduce Europe to the Maori, which is what the Maori wanted at the time. As his two Maori bynames, &#145;Te Wiremu&#146; (The Williams) and &#145;Karuwha&#146; (Four Eyes) may suggest, his reputation for prestige among the Maori needs pruning, not uprooting. Henry and Marianne Williams and their ilk ventured to the fearsome equivalent of an alien planet and devoted most of their lives to something other than themselves.<br>
