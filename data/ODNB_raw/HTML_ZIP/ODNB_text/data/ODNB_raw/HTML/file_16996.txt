<span class="headword">Langstrother <span class="st"> [Longstrother]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1471), <span class="occ">administrator and prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England</span>, seemingly came of a well-to-do northern family, several members of which were buried in St John's Hospital, Clerkenwell. Preceptor of the order's estate at Dalby, Lincolnshire, by 1448, in 1449 Langstrother became preceptor of Balsall, Warwickshire, and receiver for the treasury of the hospital in England. For twenty years his administrative, financial, and negotiating skills commended him to the order's grand master in Rhodes, as well as to Richard Neville, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1471), and English kings. By 1463 he was one of Edward IV's councillors; he was the preceptory's bailiff of Eagle, Lincolnshire, and steward of the grand master by 1469. Langstrother's prominence in the order and in the realm made him the unanimous choice of his brethren as prior of the hospital in England on 9 March 1469. The office of English prior was nationally important. Its holder was normally a royal councillor, and was also premier baron of England, so it is not surprising that he needed a royal licence before he could take up office or administer his order's estates. Edward IV distrusted Langstrother for his Neville associations, and tried to impose his young brother-in-law, Sir Richard Woodville, as prior in 1469.<br>
<br>Following the defeat of Edward's supporters at Edgcote (26 July), Langstrother was appointed treasurer of England by Warwick, but once Edward regained his independence he was removed from the treasurership (25 October 1469). Edward refused to recognize him as prior until he swore fealty (18 November), which was regarded as a dangerous precedent by the hospital. In any case, Langstrother remained Warwick's confidant: after the Lincolnshire rising of March 1470, he kept secretly in contact with Clarence, and was put in the Tower of London when the duke and Warwick fled to France. The invasion of Clarence and Warwick in September 1470 brought him back to high office; he was with the force that released Henry VI from the Tower, and on 20 October was reappointed treasurer. Henry VI rewarded his loyalty by acknowledging the rights of his order and confirming his appointment as duly elected prior on 20 December. Langstrother helped to negotiate Warwick's treaty with France (16 February 1471), and on 24 February he and John Delves were granted the wardenship of the mint. Having been sent to France for the purpose, in April 1471 he escorted Queen Margaret and her son, Prince Edward, to England and accompanied them to Tewkesbury. At the battle (4 May) he shared command of the Lancastrian centre, and following their defeat sought sanctuary in Tewkesbury Abbey. Edward was induced to pardon him and other fugitives to the abbey, but they were subsequently taken out, and on 6 May Langstrother was tried and executed in Tewkesbury's market place. His body was allowed honourable burial, in the hospital of St John at Clerkenwell.<br>
