<span class="headword">Barnett,  John Francis</span>  (1837&#150;1916), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, born in London on 16 October 1837, was the son of a singing teacher, Joseph Alfred Barnett (the younger brother of the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1478/', "John Barnett")</script>), and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hudson. He showed an early talent for music and began to study the piano at the age of six. In 1848 he commenced piano lessons with Henry Wylde and the following year won the king's scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. Before entering the academy he studied organ with George Cooper and acted as organist, first at the Roman Catholic church in Warwick Street and then at St Aloysius, Clarendon Square, where his father was choirmaster. He took up his scholarship in 1852 or 1853, and in the same year played Mendelssohn's D minor piano concerto at a New Philharmonic Society concert under Spohr's conductorship. In 1857, having completed his studies at the academy, Barnett travelled to Germany, intending to perform as a solo pianist; in Leipzig, however, he enrolled at the conservatory and studied counterpoint under Moritz Hauptmann and E. F. Richter, composition under Julius Rietz, and piano under Ignaz Moscheles and Louis Plaidy. Towards the end of this period his op. 1, a <i>caprice brillante</i> for piano, was published by Kistner. Shortly before returning to England he performed Mendelssohn's D minor concerto at a Gewandhaus concert on 22 March 1860.<br>
<br>The following month Barnett appeared with great success in London as the soloist in Beethoven's fifth piano concerto at a New Philharmonic Society concert. A contemporary reviewer remarked that he had spent the last couple of years, &#145;as we are enabled to judge from his playing on Monday evening, studying and practising with zeal and determination&#146;  (<span class="italic">Musical World</span>, 256). During the next few years he composed a succession of characteristic piano pieces, among them <span class="italic">Three Sketches</span>, op. 2, and <span class="italic">Return of Spring</span>, op. 7. His op. 8, published about 1863, however, was a string quartet in D minor, and it was a symphony in A minor (unpublished), performed at the Musical Society of London on 15 June 1864 and repeated at the Crystal Palace Saturday concerts, which drew attention to Barnett's merits as a composer. This led to his first commission, a cantata for the 1867 Birmingham festival. The success of the resulting composition, <span class="italic">The Ancient Mariner</span>, for which he arranged his own text from Coleridge's poem, led to further commissions. The rapid proliferation of choral societies throughout Britain created a steady demand for such works, and during the following decades Barnett composed <span class="italic">Paradise and the Peri</span> (1870), <span class="italic">The Raising of Lazarus</span> (1873), <span class="italic">The Good Shepherd</span> (1876), <span class="italic">The Building of the Ship</span> (1880), <span class="italic">The Wishing Bell</span> (1893), and <span class="italic">The Eve of St Agnes</span> (1913), as well as a number of smaller choral works. Other compositions included a piano concerto, a number of descriptive pieces for orchestra, a few chamber works, and many piano pieces and songs. In 1883 he completed Schubert's E major symphony from the autograph sketch belonging to Sir George Grove; he described the process in <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Musical Association</span> (17, 1890&#150;91, 177). His <span class="italic">Musical Reminiscences and Impressions</span>, published in 1906, gives a valuable account of the musicians and music-making of his time.<br>
<br>Barnett was a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music. He was among the professors at the National Training School for Music from 1876 to 1882, and joined the staff of its successor, the Royal College of Music, in 1883. He also taught at the Guildhall School of Music from its establishment in 1880. During these years he continued to perform publicly as a pianist and occasionally appeared as a conductor. On 4 September 1875 he married Alice Dora Booth, the daughter of the artist Lorenzo John Booth, with whom he had several children. She died in 1882, and on 25 July 1891 he married Mary Millicent Tussaud, the daughter of Joseph Tussaud. Barnett died at 56 Acacia Road, St John's Wood, London, on 24 November 1916.<br>
