</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackstone, Sir  William</span>  (1723&#150;1780), <span class="occ">legal writer and judge</span>, was born on 10 July 1723 in Cheapside, London, the third surviving but posthumous son of Charles Blackstone (<i>d</i>. 1723), a citizen silk mercer &#145;not of great Affluence&#146;  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, iii), and his wife, Mary, eldest daughter of Lovelace Bigg, a landed gentleman of Chilton Foliat, Wiltshire. In the biographical memoir prefixed to the 1781 edition of Blackstone's <span class="italic">Reports</span>, compiled by his executor and brother-in-law James Clitherow from &#145;a short Abstract of every Circumstance of Consequence in his Life written by himself with his accustomed Accuracy&#146;  (ibid., ii), Blackstone's paternal grandfather John is described as &#145;an eminent Apothecary in Newgate Street&#146;  (ibid., iii). But it was a medical practitioner from the other side of his family, the London surgeon Thomas Bigg, who gave protection and support to William and his brothers after the loss of their father and subsequent death of their mother during William's childhood. According to Clitherow the &#145;liberal Educations&#146; which this affectionate uncle provided his three nephews &#145;supplied the great Loss they had so early sustained, and compensated in a great Degree for their want of more ample Fortunes&#146;  (ibid., iv).<br>
<br>So William Blackstone followed his two elder brothers into the professions, rather than pursuing his father's trade. But whereas Charles and Henry went from Winchester College to New College, Oxford (where another Bigg uncle was warden), and then into the church, William received a London schooling at the Charterhouse. Enrolled as a fee-paying student in 1730, he became entitled after his mother's death five years later to a free education, provided under the terms of the founder's will for needy, well-recommended boys between the ages of ten and fourteen; Blackstone's nomination came from no less a personage than Sir Robert Walpole, arranged by one of his mother's cousins. While his &#145;Talents and Industry rendered him the favourite of his Masters&#146;, Blackstone's academic performance cannot have disappointed his family and friends  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, iv). At the age of fifteen he had become head scholar of Charterhouse, &#145;and although so young, was thought well-qualified to be removed to the University&#146;; he also showed early evidence of literary abilities, not confined to the Latin verse for which in 1737 he won a school prize medal bearing the name and likeness of the poet Milton  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="OxfordandLondon17381753"></a>Oxford and London, 1738&#150;1753</h2>Blackstone matriculated at Oxford on 1 December 1738, having been admitted to Pembroke College as a commoner the previous day, doubtless in anticipation of his election early next year to one of two Holford exhibitions tenable at Pembroke by scholars from the Charterhouse. Classical studies dominated his first two undergraduate years, and Clitherow relates that he worked &#145;with unremitting Ardour&#146; towards the BA degree  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, v). Yet he also continued to find time for literary pursuits, while &#145;Logic, Mathematicks, and the other Sciences were not neglected&#146;; in particular, he developed what would prove to be a lifelong interest in the theory and practice of architecture  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In July 1740 Blackstone was admitted as a candidate for the BCL in the faculty of laws, a course extending over five years after two preliminary years of humane studies, but requiring neither the BA nor MA degree. This shift in direction was seemingly reinforced by his admission to the Middle Temple in November 1741, even if the choice of a legal career was made only reluctantly, and &#145;with doubtful mind&#146; according to &#145;The Lawyer's Farewell to his Muse&#146;, one of several poems written in his later teens and early twenties  (&#145;Select Poems and Translations between the Years 1736 and 1744&#146;, cited in the Maggs Bros. catalogue 576 of 1932, 9&#150;10, 73). In view of this ambivalence, it was perhaps fortunate that Blackstone did not yet have to decide whether he would become a civilian, or alternatively a common lawyer.<br>
<br>As membership of the Middle Temple had no residential requirements Blackstone could remain in Oxford, pursue a relatively undemanding course of reading for the BCL (which he received in June 1745), and otherwise follow a wide range of intellectual interests. These are hinted at by the books and manuscripts he ordered up from the stacks of the Bodleian Library, including works of classical letters, theology, church history, and antiquarian studies, as well as legal texts, although the last become more prominent in the 1750s  (Bodl. Oxf., MS records e 554&#150;60). One notable product of Blackstone's student days at Oxford was a systematic treatise on architecture, embellished with proficient pen and ink drawings, which exists in preliminary draft as &#145;An abridgement of architecture&#146;, dated July 1743 (Getty Research Institute, special collections, MS 890227). This work, a precursor of Blackstone's later didactic achievements, was completed &#145;with considerable Additions and Improvements&#146; at All Souls College, where he had been elected to a fellowship in November 1743, after an unsuccessful attempt the previous year  (All Souls College, Codrington Library, MS 333, &#145;Elements of architecture&#146;). Blackstone's first publication was also written at this time, although not printed until 1747, when an anonymous prefatory &#145;Advertisement&#146; to <span class="italic">The Pantheon: a Vision</span> explained the author's aim as to &#145;take a Poetical View of the several Religions that have prevailed in the World&#146;, concluding with the Church of England, &#145;the most pure and Apostolical upon Earth&#146;  (G. Bingham, <span class="italic">Dissertations, Essays, and Sermons &hellip; to which are Prefixed Memoirs of his Life</span>, 1804, 1.xxiii&#150;xxv).<br>
<br>Blackstone does not seem to have begun serious study of the common law until January 1746, less than a year before he was called to the bar (on 28 November 1746). In a cheerful letter to Seymour Richmond, a lawyer&#150;uncle on his mother's side, written shortly after reaching &#145;my new Habitation, (which is at Mr Stoke's a Limner in Arundel-Street)&#146;, William depicted his initial encounter with Sir Thomas Littleton's <span class="italic">Tenures</span> in confident military terms: &#145;I have stormed one Book of Littleton, &amp; opened my Trenches before the 2d; and I can with Pleasure say I have met with no Difficulty of Consequence&#146;  (Warden, 58&#150;61). But whatever intellectual grasp of the common law Blackstone may have acquired, whether before or after call to the bar&#151;and following two years at the Temple he reportedly claimed to have &#145;made myself pretty well master of it&#146;&#151;he lacked two crucial keys to success: powerful legal or social connections, and the ability to think and argue on his feet. His timing was also bad, because the mid-eighteenth century marked the bottom of a long-term slump in the business of Westminster Hall. Thus he noted in December 1751 that there had been &#145;not one Determinac'on of any Moment&#146; during the whole of the past Michaelmas term, &#145;&amp; the Courts (except the Chancery) not sitting above an hour in the morning&#146; (Doolittle, 46; <span class="italic">Legal Observer</span>, 6, 1833, 421). Although the <span class="italic">Reports</span> published after his death suggest he remained a constant term-time attender at the superior law courts from 1746 until at least 1750, Clitherow states that his subject &#145;made his Way very slowly, and acquired little Notice and little Practice&#146;  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, vii). For a man of Blackstone's abilities and ambition, succeeding his uncle in 1749 as recorder of Wallingford, Berkshire&#151;where he later made his family home&#151;can hardly have compensated for lack of success in &#145;the bustling Practical part&#146; of &#145;the active Life of Westminster Hall&#146;  (Newdigate MSS, CR136/B1488).<h2>
<a name="AllSoulsandOxfordUniversity17461760"></a>All Souls and Oxford University, 1746&#150;1760</h2>At Oxford, by contrast, Blackstone enjoyed congenial friends, a secure collegiate base, and a growing reputation. There was also ample scope to exercise his abundant intellectual energies and emerging administrative skills. At All Souls College, where as early as 1746 he was elected both dean of laws and bursar, almost every aspect of college life benefited from his &#145;passion for order and efficiency and &hellip; immense capacity for hard work&#146;  (Sutherland, &#145;Blackstone and the legal chairs&#146;, 230). His architectural interests found practical expression in overseeing the long-delayed completion of the Codrington Library, together with an adjoining building financed, thanks to Blackstone's &#145;Care and Activity&#146;, from the estate of the duke of Wharton  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, viii). Thereafter he took keen interest in the arranging and cataloguing of the library's books and manuscripts, according to detailed regulations drawn up in his characteristically incisive style (All Souls College, library book, 8 Nov 1751; Craster, 79&#150;82). As bursar he reviewed all leases of college lands, reorganized the college's archives, and even put the capacious new wine cellars under the Codrington Library on a businesslike footing. His financial and legal talents were further deployed in his stewardship of the college's estates from 1749, and given literary form in an expository open letter compiled in 1753 (with subsequent holograph additions) for Benjamin Buckler, his friend and successor in office. Another abiding college concern motivated Blackstone's first acknowledged venture into print, the <span class="italic">Essay on Collateral Consanguinity</span> (1750), in which law, logic, and mathematics were marshalled to defend All Souls's restrictive approach to those seeking privileged access to fellowships on the grounds of their descent from the society's medieval founder.<br>
<br>Far from confining his energies to All Souls, Blackstone emerged as a leading university figure from 1750, when his DCL degree first admitted him to membership of convocation, the major academic forum. His decision in 1753 &#145;no longer to attend the Courts at Westminster&#146; further enhanced his Oxford profile  (Newdigate MSS, CR136/B1488). He served for six years from 1753 as assessor, or deputy judge, of the vice-chancellor's court, where he was responsible for various procedural reforms. He had less success in promoting a scheme for the recently completed Radcliffe Camera to become a &#145;Library of a new Species&#146; by housing manuscripts and drawings from the Bodleian and college collections  (I. G. Doolittle, &#145;William Blackstone and the Radcliffe Camera, 1753&#146;, <span class="italic">Bodleian Library Record</span>, 11, 1982, 47&#150;50). But this failed initiative stands in sharp contrast to the important academic and institutional reforms which Blackstone was primarily responsible for conceiving and implementing during the 1750s.<br>
<br>The first of these involved a direct assault on the oligarchical power of the board of delegates, who were traditionally appointed by successive vice-chancellors to control the university's printing and publishing operations. In 1755 dissatisfaction with the limited output, low profile, and high prices of Oxford's press led to Blackstone's nomination as a delegate, despite vice-chancellorial opposition. He proceeded to conduct a one-man review of the printing house, with particular reference to its cost structure, on which he gathered much detailed information from booksellers and printers in Oxford and London. When his report, <span class="italic">Some Thoughts on the Oxford Press</span> (1756), was coolly received by his fellow delegates, Blackstone proceeded to publish an open letter, <span class="italic">To the Reverend Dr Randolph, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford</span> (1757), which comprehensively indicted both the delegates' managerial incompetence and their mode of appointment. Further resistance saw Blackstone threaten to bring the whole matter &#145;before another less indulgent Tribunal&#146;, whereupon the delegates rapidly back-pedalled, adopting virtually all the proposals for remodelling their own role and the operation of the press which Blackstone had helpfully drafted for them  (Philip, 45&#150;72, 80).<br>
<br>Blackstone's second major initiative broke a constitutional stranglehold on the university's ability to manage its own affairs which had been imposed by the early seventeenth-century statutes known as the Laudian code. The intention of Archbishop Laud to establish a permanent educational structure for Oxford had succeeded so well that by the mid-eighteenth century the university was widely believed to lack the legal capacity to change its curriculum or internal organization, unless by an unwelcome direct intervention from government. Having confronted this potential obstacle in the course of his campaign to reform the press, Blackstone developed a cogent case against the power of any corporate body to bind its successors, &#145;who have the same right to <i>repeal</i> as the Predecessors had to <i>enact</i>&#146;  (Sutherland, &#145;The Laudian Statutes&#146;, 199). However, the issue on which the point of principle eventually turned in 1759&#150;60 was a disputed election for the office of chancellor, when questions about the eligibility of candidates and voters led to convocation's enactment of a statute which not only defined its own membership and rights but effectively established the university's legislative independence for the first time since 1636.<h2>
<a name="ThelawsofEngland"></a>The laws of England</h2>Blackstone's third significant contribution to his university lay in establishing English law as an academic discipline, initially by presenting a successful course of private lectures, then as the foundation Vinerian professor of common law, and finally with the publication of his acclaimed <span class="italic">Commentaries on the Laws of England</span> (1765&#150;9). In the summer of 1753, &#145;finding the Profits of his Profession very inadequate&#146;, Blackstone finally resolved to &#145;retire to his Fellowship and an academical Life&#146;, supplemented by whatever he could earn &#145;as a Provincial Counsel&#146;  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, x). He simultaneously commissioned a printed prospectus for &#145;A course of lectures on the laws of England&#146;, to be delivered in the hall of All Souls College. Private lecture courses on subjects outside the formal curriculum were no novelty in Hanoverian Oxford. But it seems that Blackstone had originally begun to think about lecturing in anticipation of an impending vacancy in the regius professorship of civil law. Only when it became clear that his candidacy for this chair would be politically unacceptable to the Newcastle&#150;Pelham administration did he turn to a &#145;Scheme for lectures&#146; on English common law. In so doing he was possibly influenced by private knowledge that the elderly Charles Viner had recently determined to endow a professorship in that subject for a scholar who, like Blackstone, held qualifications in both civil and common law  (Newdigate MSS, CR136/B1488).<br>
<br>Blackstone's initial lectures were sufficiently well received to be repeated in 1754, the prospectus for that year representing them as part of a &#145;Design, for cultivating the Study of the Municipal Law in Oxford&#146;  (W. Blackstone, <span class="italic">Proposals for a Course of Lectures</span>, 1754: Bodl. Oxf., G. A. Oxon. b. 111 (50)). Whatever his shortcomings as an advocate, and despite a manner of delivery which the hostile Jeremy Bentham, who attended his lectures in the early 1760s, later characterized as &#145;formal, precise, and affected&#146;, Blackstone proved highly effective when speaking from a prepared text  (G. Jones, introduction, in W. Blackstone, <span class="italic">The Sovereignty of the Law: Selections from Blackstone's &#145;Commentaries on the Laws of England&#146;</span>, 1973, xvii). His carefully arranged material was presented in a literate and polished fashion, and not directed exclusively to intending future lawyers, but rather to &#145;such other Gentlemen of the University, as are desirous to be in some Degree acquainted with the Constitution and legal Polity of their native Country&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., G. A. Oxon. b. 111 (50)). With this general audience firmly in mind Blackstone sought to:<blockquote>lay down a general and comprehensive Plan of the Laws of England; to deduce their History and Antiquities; to select and illustrate their Leading Rules, and Fundamental Principles; to explain their Reason and Utility; and to compare them frequently with the Laws of Nature and of other Nations; without dwelling too minutely on the Niceties of Practice, or the more refined Distinctions of particular Cases. (ibid.)</blockquote>From 1756, the year of Viner's death, successive printed editions of the lecturer's <span class="italic">Analysis of the Laws of England</span> provided students with &#145;the Order, and principal Divisions, of his Course&#146;  (ibid., viii). Given that neither English university had previously offered any formal instruction in English law, and considering the distinct shortage of accessible introductory texts to that notoriously dry and difficult subject, Blackstone's pioneering exposition was bound to attract attention, both within Oxford and beyond.<br>
<br>Although Blackstone had made himself the obvious&#151;and, as it turned out, sole&#151;candidate for what became the Vinerian chair in English law, establishing Viner's benefaction in a manner acceptable to Blackstone and his supporters was not achieved without considerable wrangling. The eventual comprehensive defeat of various personal and political opponents left a legacy of resentment which outlasted Blackstone's formal election as Vinerian professor in October 1758 and his &#145;elegant and admired&#146; inaugural lecture, separately published as <span class="italic">A Discourse on the Study of the Law</span>. But while such animosities may have contributed to his eventual removal from the university, and undoubtedly frustrated his plan to annex a residential foundation of common lawyers to the Vinerian chair, they hardly dented Blackstone's burgeoning reputation outside Oxford. Lord Bute as royal tutor invited Blackstone to present his lectures before the prince of Wales (who received written copies when the lecturer declined to leave his Oxford classes), while the &#145;high Character of a Professor at Oxford&#146;, said to have brought the law's &#145;Mysterious Business to some System&#146;, attracted notice even across the Atlantic (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, xiii; <span class="italic">Letter Book of John Watts</span>, ed. D. C. Barck, 1928, 13).<br>
<br>This new-found fame, &#145;which he justly thought might entitle him to some particular Notice at the Bar&#146;, encouraged Blackstone in June 1759 to buy a Middle Temple chamber and resume his London practice, declining an offer of promotion to the now diminished professional dignity of serjeant-at-law in the hope of better things to come  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, xiii&#150;xiv). But it was not until after his marriage in 1761 and the births of his first children (see below) that a printed version of his lectures appeared. While publication was doubtless always a possibility, the decision to go into print may well have been hastened by threats of a pirate edition from Dublin, as also by concern about the growing circulation of imperfect sets of student notes, recognition that his future did not lie in Oxford, and some sense that his text, sufficiently honed by years of repetition and revision, was unlikely to benefit from further reworking.<br>
<br>The first volume of the <span class="italic">Commentaries on the Laws of England</span> appeared in 1765, with the remaining three following over the next four years. In some 2000 pages the common law's tortuous complexities were outlined in a manner at once authoritative, clear, elegant, and even engaging. While far from wholly laudatory or uncritical (of procedural complexities or excessively harsh criminal punishments, for example), the <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> depicted England's constitution and laws as reflecting the natural order of the cosmos, yet also rooted in the nation's distinctive historical development, like &#145;an old Gothic castle, erected in the days of chivalry, but fitted up for a modern inhabitant&#146;  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Commentaries</span>, 3.268). Although mounting criticism tempered an initial highly favourable reception, Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> would become the most celebrated, widely circulated, and influential law book ever published in the English language.<h2>
<a name="Politicsandprinciples17511762"></a>Politics and principles, 1751&#150;1762</h2>Long before making his name as a legal author Blackstone had enjoyed a rather different reputation as the most powerful Oxford academic politician of his day. His leadership from All Souls of a loose-knit tory coalition was indeed responsible for giving that relatively small society unprecedented prominence in university affairs throughout the 1750s. Blackstone's public political career began in 1751, when he took over Sir Roger Newdigate's campaign for one of the university's two parliamentary seats. Although near contemporaries as undergraduates, with a common friend in James Clitherow (whose sister Blackstone married a decade later), Newdigate and Blackstone apparently had not met when the latter wrote from All Souls on 13 January 1751, warning Newdigate that a new candidate threatened to split the vote of those &#145;Old Interest&#146; dons who had successfully maintained Oxford's intransigence towards successive whig administrations ever since the Hanoverian succession  (Newdigate MSS, CR136/B1482&#150;1483, 1485&#150;1486).<br>
<br>Soon after this well-managed by-election launched Newdigate's long career as a university MP, Blackstone's tory sympathies were voiced in the elegiac verses he contributed (albeit under his future brother-in-law's name) to an Oxford anthology mourning the premature death of Prince Frederick  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, vi&#150;vii). According to his political opponents Blackstone was also responsible for much anonymous journalism in the tory interest during the fiercely fought county election of 1754; he certainly wrote a tract against extending the parliamentary franchise to copyholders, commissioned by candidates in this struggle and published in 1758, together with a pamphlet discrediting revelations of a supposed Jacobite conspiracy in Oxford. His next major political intervention occurred in 1758&#150;9, when he helped the earl of Westmorland become chancellor by arguing that his chief opponent, Lord Litchfield, had rendered himself technically ineligible. The latter's subsequent withdrawal provoked considerable bitterness against Blackstone, even within his own college, which was probably not diminished by the skirmishes preceding modification of the Laudian code in July 1760.<br>
<br>Henceforth Blackstone's growing activities and reputation outside Oxford, coinciding with the tory party's return from the political wilderness at George III's accession, tended to diminish his effectiveness as a university politician. In the fierce chancellorship contest in 1762 he found himself altogether on the wrong side by opposing Litchfield, who was not only ultimately successful but the candidate backed by Bute and Shelburne, those aristocratic patrons who offered Blackstone his best chance of advancement. Despite this embarrassing d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, and his eventual departure from Oxford, Blackstone continued to be regarded there as a person of influence, although his last recorded direct intervention in an Oxford political contest, the parliamentary election of 1768, again saw the defeat of his favoured candidate.<br>
<br>Like other aspects of his Oxford career, Blackstone's political activism was doubtless partly motivated by personal ambition. Yet his role in the 1762 chancellorship election hardly suggests a man driven wholly or largely by self-seeking expediency, even if some contemporaries professed difficulty in understanding just what his principles were. During the 1750s Blackstone had been closely identified with Oxford toryism and its oppositionist &#145;country&#146; values, including hostility to ministerial corruption, and support for greater parliamentary independence through place bills and more frequent elections. Yet he consistently repudiated any &#145;Tincture of Jacobitism&#146;, observing that &#145;To be subservient to French Views, is no more to be wished by an Englishman, than to German&#146;  (Newdigate MSS, CR136/B1492). This tone of sturdy independence was maintained after 1760, even though Blackstone now could and did seek advancement under the crown. As he wrote to Shelburne in October 1762, explaining (but not excusing) his position in the contest for the Oxford chancellorship: &#145;I think it is essential to the Spirit of Liberty to follow my own Convictions&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Film 2000, MS Shelburne 35, fols. 158&#150;9).<h2>
<a name="Patronageandparliament17581770"></a>Patronage and parliament, 1758&#150;1770</h2>Of course there was a price to be paid for acting on such assertions. Shelburne, who had attended his lectures as an undergraduate, not only brought Blackstone to Bute's notice, but vigorously promoted his former teacher's career in the opening months of the new reign. While declining nomination as chief justice of Ireland in March 1761, on the stated grounds of &#145;a provincial Narrowness in my Constitution, that I could rather wish to exert the little Share of Abilities I am Master of &hellip; in my own native Country&#146;, Blackstone hesitated only momentarily before accepting the offer of a House of Commons seat, for which he had been recommended to Bute by Shelburne as &#145;a man of business&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Film 1999, MS Shelburne 35, fol. 137). This entry to public life apparently cost Blackstone nothing: indeed he stipulated that it must not &#145;injure my private Fortune; which is confined within moderate Bounds&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Film 2000, MS Shelburne 35, fol. 139<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). By year's end he was nevertheless pointing out that the preferment he had received to date, which included a patent of precedence at the bar, equivalent to appointment as king's counsel, &#145;has no Emolument annexed to it&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Film 2000, MS Shelburne 35, fol. 151). When the office of chief justice of Chester went to someone else, he began pressing Shelburne for a seat on the judicial bench proper. However ambitious for a man of Blackstone's relative youth and limited Westminster Hall experience, his failure to achieve this goal until 1770 must in part reflect the withdrawal of Shelburne's support in the aftermath of the 1762 Oxford chancellorship election, as well as Blackstone's somewhat unsatisfactory parliamentary performance (see further below). Contact between the two dropped off markedly from December 1762 onwards; there is no indication that Shelburne helped him to the largely honorific position of solicitor-general to Queen Charlotte which he achieved in 1763, and Blackstone appears to have ceased approaching Shelburne altogether after October 1766, when he vainly sought assistance in recommending his cause to the new lord chancellor  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Film 2000, MS Shelburne 35, fols. 153&#150;4, 155&#150;6, 158&#150;9, 162&#150;3, 168&#150;9). While the aristocratic if financially embarrassed Bertie family were important clients, and he was also &#145;deeply connected&#146; with Lord Suffolk, these ties hardly compensated for the loss of Shelburne's personal connections and influence.<br>
<br>Blackstone needed preferment partly because he had been obliged to abandon his All Souls fellowship on his marriage in May 1761, the same month that he became a bencher of the Middle Temple. Regrettably little is known about his wife, Sarah Clitherow (<i>d</i>. 1783), the elder daughter of James Clitherow of Boston House, Brentford, Middlesex, &#145;with whom he passed near nineteen Years, in the Enjoyment of the purest domestic and conjugal Felicity&#146;&#151;and which (according to her brother) &#145;he used often to declare, was the happiest part of his Life&#146;  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, xvi). These sentiments may well have been more than mere conventional rhetoric. Sarah and William had nine children, in whose upbringing and well-being he took a considerable and perhaps somewhat intimidating interest; Henry, his eldest surviving son, later pursued a wholly undistinguished career in Canada, but James, the second-born, eventually followed in his father's footsteps as fellow of All Souls and Vinerian professor. The judge and his wife occasionally travelled together, and having presumably learned to deal with his notoriously short temper, she reportedly objected to &#145;the Contraction of the Brows, &amp; consequent Sternness of Look&#146; in a contemporary likeness of her husband (Newdigate MSS, CR136/B1500; &#145;Letters&#146;, 16).<br>
<br>Blackstone did not finally quit Oxford until 1766, when he resigned both his chair and the principalship of New Inn Hall, to which he had been appointed by Lord Westmorland, in belated return for his support in the 1758 chancellorship election. Even then he retained some vestigial involvements with both town and gown. As visitor on the Michel foundation of Queen's College (to which he had been formally elected in 1757), he steered the college through the legal and legislative steps required to complete an ambitious building programme and finally secure the benefits of Michel's endowment. As legal adviser to successive earls of Abingdon he sought to improve the value of their entangled family estates as well as to benefit the city and university by promoting a toll bridge over the River Thames at Swinford, and reconstructing the Botley causeway leading west out of Oxford. However, no more is heard of his larger earlier ambition to reform &#145;Academical Education&#146;, by eliminating &#145;monastic Pedantry&#146; and adapting it &#145;to Gentlemen of Rank &amp; Fortune&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Film 2000, MS Shelburne 35, fols. 151&#150;2).<br>
<br>Besides growing family responsibilities, the demands of his practice, and scholarly activities associated with the Society of Antiquaries, to which he had been elected following his learned edition of <span class="italic">The Great Charter and Charter of the Forest</span> (1759) with its substantial &#145;Introductory discourse&#146;, parliamentary business also drew Blackstone away from Oxford. After a first term as member for Hindon (1761&#150;8), Blackstone was returned in 1768 for Westbury, another Wiltshire borough, this time by the influence of his aristocratic client Lord Abingdon. Initially an infrequent and perhaps always &#145;an indifferent speaker&#146;, he followed Bute rather than the Rockingham ministry in opposing repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in 1766  (Namier, 96). While impressed by the substance of his contribution to this debate, one observer thought its manner &#145;much like that of reading a lecture in College&#146;  (P. D. G. Thomas, <span class="italic">British Politics and the Stamp Act Crisis</span>, 1975, 197). Unsurprisingly Blackstone developed an even greater aversion to parliament &#145;where&#146; (as he purportedly said) &#145;amid the Rage of contending Parties, a Man of Moderation must expect to meet with no Quarter from any Side&#146;, than he had earlier done to the bar  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, xx). At the end of a long debate in May 1769 his self-acknowledged &#145;natural diffidence&#146; left him wordless in the face of George Grenville's claim that his own <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> confuted his support for John Wilkes's exclusion from parliament  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Film 2000, MS Shelburne 35, fol. 153). Subsequent editions were amended to meet this objection, encouraging opposition toasts to &#145;the <i>first</i> edition of Dr Blackstone's Commentaries&#146;  (G. Jones, introduction, in W. Blackstone, <span class="italic">The Sovereignty of the Law: Selections from Blackstone's &#145;Commentaries on the Laws of England&#146;</span>, 1973, xx). Yet while he had largely endorsed the government stand on Wilkes&#151;despite having voted against general warrants in 1763, and his own claim that he &#145;could not intirely agree with either the Ministry or the Opposition, in their Conduct with respect to Mr Wilkes&#146;&#151;his parliamentary record overall hardly justifies the charge of unprincipled place-seeking behaviour levelled by Junius in several slashing responses to Blackstone's printed attempts at self-vindication  (&#145;A letter to the author of the question stated&#146;, in W. Meredith, <span class="italic">Letter to Dr Blackstone</span>, 1770, 3).<h2>
<a name="Judge"></a>Judge</h2>Blackstone's House of Commons career ended formally in February 1770, although his refusal of the office of solicitor-general the month before clearly signalled an intention to retire from public political life. While his initial parliamentary seat was, in his words at the time, &#145;conferred unsought, &amp; accepted unconditionally&#146;, and he had told Shelburne as early as July 1762 that &#145;my ambition now rises to the Post of an English Judge&#146;, the long and bruising controversy over Wilkes must have influenced his acceptance of a puisne justice's place on the court of common pleas, together with a knighthood  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Film 2000, MS Shelburne 35, fols. 153&#150;4). In the event Blackstone agreed to respond to Justice Joseph Yates's &#145;Representation of his infirm State of Health&#146; by replacing him on the busier king's bench, where he sat alongside Lord Mansfield as chief justice  (<span class="italic">University of California Chronicle</span>, 12/4, 1910, 346&#150;7). But he returned to common pleas less than six months later, following Yates's death early in June.<br>
<br>According to Clitherow his subject &#145;seemed now arrived at the Point he always wished for&#146;  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, xx). Yet Blackstone's judicial reputation was somewhat mixed. As an assize judge sitting alone he purportedly had more new trials granted on cases decided before him than any of his Westminster colleagues: &#145;The reason was that, being extremely diffident of his opinion, he never supported it with much warmth or pertinacity in the court above if a new trial was moved for&#146;  (Prior, 431&#150;2). Yet on appeals to the full court he often carried his brethren with him, as when in 1772 he delivered the exchequer chamber's opinion which upheld a strict construction of the venerable rule in Shelley's case in the long-running suit of <i>Perrin v. Blake</i>  (A. W. B. Simpson, <span class="italic">Leading Cases in the Common Law</span>, 1995, chap. 2). Whether with the majority or in dissent, his arguments were always careful and learned. Blackstone's judicial standing might have been enhanced if the case notes published by his executors in somewhat literal-minded accordance with his will had been better prepared for the press, thereby giving less occasion for Mansfield's remark that &#145;Mr Justice Blackstone's Reports are not very accurate&#146;  (J. S. Waterman, &#145;Mansfield and Blackstone's <i>Commentaries</i>&#146;, <span class="italic">University of Chicago Law Review</span>, 1, 1934, 555&#150;7). It is also possible that in reporting his own decisions Blackstone erred on the side of excessive modesty  (H. J. Hanbury, &#145;Blackstone as judge&#146;, <span class="italic">American Journal of Legal History</span>, 3, 1959, 26).<br>
<br>In criminal matters Blackstone displayed characteristic concern &#145;to keep strictly up to Forms&#146;  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, xxvii), even when extending &#145;a Degree of Indulgence&#146; to bail a prisoner from York gaol, deputing a Wallingford attorney to act as deputy clerk of assize for the northern circuit in order to draft the necessary recognizance  (&#145;Letters of Sir William Blackstone&#146;, 364&#150;5). In 1771 he showed no trace of compassion towards &#145;a bold artful Man&#146; sentenced to hang for returning from transportation (&#145;I saw nothing in him that made him an Object of Mercy&#146;); but much of his energy and political skills during these years were devoted to the cause of penal reform  (BL, Add. MS 61674, fol. 69). As early as April 1770 Blackstone proposed statutory amendments to clarify the law relating to transportation  (E. Sussex RO, SAS/RF 18/122&#150;4). Then, in consultation with his former pupil the MP William Eden, he drafted a &#145;Convict Bill&#146; in 1776, providing for the establishment of &#145;Penitentiary Houses&#146;, or prisons as an alternative to transportation; over the next three years Blackstone &#145;spared neither Time nor Pains&#146; to further these proposals, and after the <span class="roman">Penitentiary Act</span> finally passed in 1779 he continued to work for its implementation. Another successful lobbying campaign, which again relied heavily on Eden and other political contacts, as well as his own &#145;Industry and Attention&#146;  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, xxii&#150;xxiii), eventually secured legislation to augment the salaries paid to the puisne judges, and hence their independence from the administration.<br>
<br>Besides additions and corrections to the five successive new editions of the <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> published between 1770 and 1778, Blackstone also found time for &#145;Poetical Criticism&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. c.15, fol. 21), some fruits of which were subsequently included in Edward Malone's <span class="italic">Supplement to the Edition of Shakespeare's Plays</span> (1780) and an &#145;Investigation of the quarrel between Pope and Addison&#146; published in the second edition of Andrew Kippis's <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span> (1779&#150;93). But his mental energies were outrunning his physical powers. After a partial breakdown in 1758, the last twenty years of Blackstone's life were marked by frequent attacks of gout and vertigo, to which growing corpulence, dislike of physical exercise, and what one contemporary categorized as his &#145;temperate use&#146; of port all doubtless contributed  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 4.91). In December 1779 &#145;a violent Shortness of Breath&#146; was temporarily relieved by his physicians, but a second attack early next year in London &#145;baffled all the Art of Medicine&#146;, and led to his death, presumably of congestive heart failure, in London on 14 February 1780 at the age of fifty-six  (Blackstone, <span class="italic">Reports</span>, xxiii).<br>
<br>Sir William Blackstone was buried in the family vault he had built in the parish church of St Peter's, Wallingford, the reconstruction of which was yet another project of his final years. His will  (PROB 11/1061, fols. 101<i>v</i>&#150;105<i>v</i>) appointed his &#145;dear wife&#146; Sarah as executor, alongside her brother James Clitherow. Besides leaving mourning rings to a wide circle of relatives, and his professional library to the first of his sons to take up the law, Blackstone bequeathed a small number of manuscript and early printed law books to All Souls College, together with his collection of the works of William Prynne. Although he was said to have made over &pound;14,000 from his lectures and the <span class="italic">Commentaries</span>, the full value of his estate is unknown  (Prior, 431).<h2>
<a name="Influenceandreputation"></a>Influence and reputation</h2>The influence of Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> is difficult to exaggerate. Twenty-three successive English and Irish editions had appeared by 1854, together with a plethora of digests and extracts, directed mostly at law students, but also adapted for school use, and the education of young ladies; <span class="italic">The Comic Blackstone</span> (1844 and later editions) was compiled from instalments first published in <span class="italic">Punch</span>. There were translations into French, German, Italian, and Russian (vol. 1 only), while Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> continued to represent England's common law throughout the British imperial diaspora for more than a century after their author's death. The <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> long dominated legal education in North America, where nearly 100 editions and abridgements had been produced by 1900. Blackstone's other legal, historical, and literary writings received little attention, just as the life of their author has been largely approached via, and overshadowed by, his greatest work.<br>
<br>The immediate fame of both text and author scarcely precluded criticism. By modifying several passages on the civil disabilities of dissenters, Blackstone showed himself anxious to accommodate complaints from their spokesmen Philip Furneaux and Joseph Priestley  (K. Haakonssen, ed., <span class="italic">Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in Eighteenth-Century Britain</span>, 1996, 191&#150;2). But he left unanswered Jeremy Bentham's <span class="italic">Fragment on Government</span> (1776), which so effectively portrayed him as a confused and shallow apologist for the <i>status quo</i> that his intellectual and political reputation had barely began to recover before the early twentieth century. However, it is now widely recognized that, in targeting Blackstone's shortcomings as a legal theorist, Bentham deliberately ignored his prime aim and achievement, which was to expound the state of English law in his own day, not to justify it in abstract terms. Re-evaluation of Blackstone's life and work has been hampered by a lack of personal papers, the bulk and diversity of his writings, and his tendency to self-effacement. Recent scholarship has none the less broken much new ground, so there may yet be attained a more balanced and realistic portrait of this ambitious, complex, and multi-talented representative of the English Enlightenment.<br>
