<span class="headword">Williams,  Charles James Blasius</span>  (1805&#150;1889), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 3 February 1805 at Hungerford Almshouse, Heytesbury, Wiltshire, the eighth of the nine children of the Revd David Williams (1751&#150;1836), warden of the almshouse and curate of Heytesbury church, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1820), daughter of a Chepstow surgeon, also named Williams. Under his father, an experienced tutor, Williams was educated at home until he entered Edinburgh University in 1820 to study medicine. He obtained his MD in 1824 by thesis, based on his paper &#145;On the blood and its changes by respiration and secretion&#146;, which he had read at the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh in 1823. The same year he presented a paper on low combustion at the Royal Society, and lectured on the subject at the Royal Institution, where, encouraged by Michael Faraday to experiment further, he later demonstrated the combustibility of various materials. In 1834 he read another paper on the topic at the British Association meeting.<br>
<br>Williams attended Sir Charles Bell's lectures in London; then in 1825 went to Paris, where he took drawing lessons as well as pursuing his medical studies. His tutors included La&euml;nnec, Gay-Lussac, and Andral, and he also became acquainted with the physiologist Majendie. He gained experience at La Charit&eacute; and other hospitals, and from La&euml;nnec learned a method of auscultation using the stethoscope: a technique which would eventually lead to a greater knowledge of heart and lung disease. His important work on auscultation, <span class="italic">A Rational Exposition of the Physical Signs of the Disease of the Lungs and Pleura</span> (1828), reached four editions. Williams returned to England in 1827 and then acted as a personal physician accompanying patients abroad. In 1830 he married Harriett Williams, daughter of James Jenkins of Chepstow, and a maternal cousin. They raised five sons and three daughters. A fourth daughter was stillborn. At about the time of his marriage Williams established his own practice in Half Moon Street, London, attended several dispensaries, and had a practice at St George's Hospital, where he became a governor.<br>
<br>Williams, who was small, confident, and industrious, could be frank and sometimes disputatious with colleagues. From about 1831 he and James Hope started investigating the sounds of the heart, but differences arose between them which were not satisfactorily resolved. Nevertheless some reports of Williams's findings were presented to the British Association in 1835&#150;7. For two consecutive years (1836&#150;7) he lectured on chest diseases at the Kinnerton Street Anatomical School, and in 1839 was appointed professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College and physician to University College Hospital. Considered a skilled diagnostician, his lectures were well attended. In addition he was consulting physician to the Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest (Brompton), of which he was a joint founder with Sir Philip Rose.<br>
<br>As the combined posts at University College were arduous, Williams's health gradually suffered and in 1849 he resigned to concentrate on his growing private practice, which moved in 1850 from Holles Street to Upper Brook Street. In 1852 he was summoned to attend the duke of Wellington at Walmer Castle, but arrived too late to assist. He was involved in a notable libel case in 1869&#150;70 with the duke and duchess of Somerset over the death of their son, but was duly exonerated and received a suitable apology. In 1874 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria, but retired from practice the following year and moved to his villa in Cannes, although he often returned to England in the summer.<br>
<br>Williams was active in many societies, and was president of both the Harveian and Westminster medical societies early in his career. In 1835 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1840 fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London, where he became Goulstonian lecturer in 1841, censor 1846&#150;7, and Lumleian lecturer in 1862. The constitutions of these two societies were not wholly to his liking and he was not fully at ease with his fellowships. Liberal in attitude he tried to achieve change but failed to remove the restrictions that both societies maintained. He was the first (1846) president of the Pathological Society and in 1858 became the first president of the New Sydenham Society, which specialized in medical translation and publishing. In 1867 he helped to found the Clinical Society, and at the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, where he had been elected a fellow in 1840, he served as president in 1873&#150;5.<br>
<br>Williams was an accomplished writer. He contributed several articles on chest diseases for the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine</span> (1833&#150;5). His articles on respiratory disease were published in <span class="italic">The Library of Medicine</span> (1840), and he also produced a standard medical work, <span class="italic">Principles of Medicine</span> (1843), which was very well received and advanced the profession's knowledge of pathology. It reached several editions and was also translated. <span class="italic">Pulmonary Consumption</span> (written jointly with his son Dr Charles Theodore Williams) appeared in 1871, and he also wrote his own <span class="italic">Memoirs of Life and Work</span> (1884) and contributed articles to various scientific and medical journals; one in the <span class="italic">London Journal of Medicine</span> (1849) extolled the value of cod-liver oil, reporting a marked improvement in the condition of tuberculous patients who received it. Williams was not the first, however, to discover the efficacy of this product.<br>
<br>In retirement Williams developed his interest in astronomy to study sunspots in relation to weather changes, and also studied the scriptures; but his health was never robust, and after catching a cold which turned to pneumonia he died at his home, the Villa du Rocher, Cannes, on 24 March 1889. He was buried in Cannes on 27 March. He was survived by his widow and six of their children.<br>
