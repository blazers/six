<span class="headword">Macklin,  Thomas</span>  (1752/3&#150;1800), <span class="occ">printseller and picture dealer</span>, may have been the son of &#145;the Reverend Garrard Macklin of the Kingdom of Ireland&#146; mentioned in the will of Thomas Wilson, prebendary of Westminster, from whom Thomas Macklin inherited considerable property in 1784. His friend the engraver John Landseer said that Macklin had been an &#145;Irish cabin boy&#146; and later a frame gilder who had learned stipple engraving from Francesco Bartolozzi  (Landseer, <span class="italic">Algernon Sidney's Letter</span>, 22). In 1777 he married Hannah Kenting (<i>d</i>. 1808). In 1779 he began business as a printseller at 1 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, and in 1782 moved to 39 Fleet Street. In the same year he enjoyed considerable success with his print of the recently deceased Rear-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt, which sold 7000 copies. Two years later he inherited half of Thomas Wilson's &pound;20,000 estate, and not long thereafter he began the print speculations which were to make him famous.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1787 Macklin announced his plan to commission 100 paintings illustrating the works of the English poets to be published as engravings at monthly intervals between February 1790 and January 1795. In the event the progress of <span class="italic">Macklin's English Poets</span>, better known as <span class="italic">The Poets' Gallery</span>, was inhibited by the war with France (which closed the continent to the extensive British export trade in prints) and by the death of his sleeping partner Edward Rogers (1750&#150;1795) of Liverpool who had invested &pound;11,000. Even with this assistance the project remained prohibitively expensive. The considerable sum of &pound;500 was paid for Sir Joshua Reynolds's <span class="italic">Cottagers</span>, also known as <span class="italic">The Macklin Family</span> on account of its depiction of Macklin's wife and their daughter Maria. Between 1788 and 1799 only six parts (each containing four prints) were published. In addition to work by Reynolds, these parts included paintings by Henry Fuseli, Thomas Gainsborough, Angelica Kauffmann, Thomas Stothard, and Francis Wheatley, with most of the engravings being undertaken by Bartolozzi. Like his rival printsellers, John Boydell and Robert Bowyer, Macklin held annual exhibitions, the first of which opened in Pall Mall on 14 April 1788.<br>
<br>In 1789 Macklin announced plans for an illustrated folio <span class="roman">Bible</span> in three (eventually six) volumes to promote &#145;the glory of the English school&#146; of painting and engraving and &#145;the interest of our HOLY RELIGION&#146;. New type (cut by Joseph Jackson and Vincent Figgins) and new paper were created for the venture, and the historic paintings were to be &#145;finished in a style of elegance [and magnificence in Paper, Printing, and Engraving] of which there is not in Europe or the world any example&#146;  (Macklin's <span class="italic">Holy Bible</span> prospectus, 1789). Macklin initially proposed sixty prints (eventually seventy-two) plus vignettes. The largest number of paintings (sixteen, in addition to 111 vignettes) were undertaken by Philippe Jacques de Louthenbourg; Hugh Douglas Hamilton produced a further twelve paintings and John Opie seven. Other artists included Richard Cosway, Benjamin West, and Richard Westall, as well as Fuseli, Kauffmann, Reynolds, and Stothard, and the subscription list for 703 copies at &pound;46 1<i>s</i>. apiece was headed by the king, the queen, and the prince of Wales. Macklin's project was again ambitious and costly. He paid Reynolds &pound;500 for his <span class="italic">Holy Family</span> and William Sharp &pound;700 for its engraving; the average cost for forty-five of the <span class="roman">Bible's</span> other engravings was &pound;220 and the total cost of the publication was an estimated &pound;30,000. Macklin's resulting indebtedness required him to sell some of the Poets' Gallery paintings by lottery in 1797, but with the financial assistance of John Wilson of Liverpool work on Macklin's <span class="italic">Holy Bible</span> was finally brought to its triumphant conclusion. The last engraving was finished just five days before his death, aged forty-seven, at Fleet Street on 25 October 1800, and the last of the vignettes was completed six weeks later. The Macklin <span class="roman">Bible</span> endures as the most ambitious edition produced in Britain, often pirated but never rivalled.<br>
<br>A major force in the florescence of book illustration in England in the 1790s, Macklin also spent possibly as much as &pound;300,000 as a patron of the arts. His widow continued the Poets' Gallery until 1801 when, on 27&#150;30 May, the remaining paintings were sold. Another, unsuccessful, auction was held after her death on 12 January 1808. Macklin's second daughter, Hannah, was left in such financial dolour that appeals were made to the Royal Academy for her living expenses in 1821 and her funeral in the following year.<br>
