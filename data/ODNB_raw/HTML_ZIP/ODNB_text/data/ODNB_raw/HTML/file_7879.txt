<span class="headword">Douglas,  David</span>  (1799&#150;1834), <span class="occ">plant collector and traveller</span>, was born on 25 June 1799 at Scone, Perthshire, one of six children of John Douglas, a stonemason, and his wife, Jean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drummond. Quick to learn but often truant from school owing to his passion for natural history, he was apprenticed at the age of ten in the gardens of the earl of Mansfield at Scone. In 1818 he became under-gardener to Sir Robert Preston at Valleyfield, near Culross in Perthshire, whence, about 1820, he moved to the botanical garden at Glasgow. There he attended the botanical lectures of W. J. Hooker, whom he accompanied on several excursions to the highlands. According to Hooker, Douglas's &#145;great activity, undaunted courage, singular abstemiousness, and energetic zeal, at once pointed him out as an individual eminently calculated to do himself credit as a scientific traveller&#146;  (Hooker, 87). These qualities led Hooker to recommend Douglas as a plant collector to Joseph Sabine, secretary to the Horticultural Society of London.<br>
<br>In 1823 the society sent Douglas to America, where he spent four months collecting in the eastern parts of the United States and Canada. Soon after his return to London Douglas was commissioned again by the society, this time for a more ambitious journey to the Columbia River in America's Pacific north-west. After arriving at Fort Vancouver in April 1825 he spent two years combing the mountainous regions of the north-west in pursuit of new species of plants, birds, and mammals. He endured continual hardship from exposure, fatigue, lack of food, and native hostility. In March 1827 he left for England by an overland route, bearing a profusion of live plants unknown in the gardens of Europe. The botanical world was astonished by the wealth of Douglas's collection, and received him with great enthusiasm. This pleased him at first, but at length the lionization caused revulsion and irritability, &#145;so that his best friends could not but wish, as he himself did, that he were again occupied in the honourable task of exploring North-west America&#146;  (Hooker, 142). John Murray offered to publish his travel journals, but they did not finally appear in print until 1914.<br>
<br>In 1829 Douglas embarked once again for north-west America, this time travelling via Cape Horn and the Sandwich Islands. He reached the mouth of the Columbia River in June 1830, and spent the summer and autumn making journeys into the interior. In December he took ship for Monterey in California where he stayed nineteen months collecting along the Spanish mission trail before returning to the Columbia. In October 1833 he sailed to the Sandwich Islands where, in Laupahoehoe Forest near Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii on 12 July 1834, he met his death when he fell into a pit trap and was gored by a wild bull. He was buried at Kawaiahao church cemetery, Honolulu, on 4 August.<br>
<br>Douglas's introductions to the horticultural world number over 200, including the famous Douglas fir (<i>Pseudotsuga taxifolia</i>) and the sugar pine (<i>Pinus lambertiana</i>). The Royal Society's catalogue credits him with fourteen papers. He was described by his fellow traveller, F. McDonald, as &#145;a sturdy little Scot, handsome rather, with a head and face of a fine Grecian mould; of winning address, and withal the most pious of men&#146;  (Coats, 310). His death at the age of only thirty-five cut short what was certain to have been a great career in plant collecting.<br>
