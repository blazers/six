<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marshall,  Stephen</span>  (1594/5?&#150;1655), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Godmanchester, Huntingdonshire, the son of a poor glover. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Godmanchester and matriculated as a pensioner in Easter term 1615 from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, which exercised patronage over his school. He graduated BA in 1618.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>That year Marshall left university and became chaplain to the Barnardiston family at Clare Priory, Suffolk, probably acting as lecturer at Clare and attending the informal graduate seminary run by the puritan minister Richard Blackerby at nearby Ashen, Essex. In 1619 he succeeded the puritan Richard Rogers as lecturer at Wethersfield, Essex. This seems to have been on the recommendation of his former tutor, John Garnons. He was ordained deacon in London on 19 December 1619, when he was described as aged twenty-four, and priest on 12 March 1620. His preaching was very successful; he lodged with William Wiltshire, whose conversion he had effected, and he was given a library worth &pound;50 in return for a promise he would stay at Wethersfield.<br>
<br>However, when Thomas Pickering, the vicar of Finchingfield, Essex, died, the patron, William Kemp of Spains Hall, hoped for Marshall as Pickering's successor. The cure was offered to Marshall and he took his scruples to a committee of puritan ministers who judged that his promise was not binding and authorized Marshall to accept the offer, noting the attractions of the security of tenure attached to a vicarage. He was instituted as vicar of Finchingfield on 25 October 1625, and there he established his reputation as a puritan minister in several ways. He became renowned for his preaching, delivering moving sermons in a direct fashion with rather more passion than rhetorical decoration. His hostile biographer describes him as &#145;of middle stature, thick shouldered, swarthy Complexion, his eyes always rowling in his head &hellip; His deportment was clownish, like his breeding: his garb slovenly &hellip; his Gate [gait] shackling, and the Furniture within not unlike the outside&#146;  (<span class="italic">Godly Man's Legacy</span>, 27). His style proved popular, however, and he was a regular visitor to many pulpits across Essex.<br>
<br>Marshall also met with success in his pastoral duties, in particular in bringing his patron out of his withdrawn, silent state and back into society. In addition, he was very active in remodelling the vestry and town meeting in his parish, providing a campaign to reform the morals of the town, closing down unruly alehouses and conducting attempts to reduce vagrancy and to reduce numbers of illegitimate children. A &#145;privie watch&#146; was established to keep an eye on those townspeople suspected of being disorderly. On a more positive side, the vestry provided emergency housing, wood and grain, and other relief for the poor and generally improved the local amenities with no clear boundary between civil and ecclesiastical business.<h2>
<a name="Socialconnections"></a>Social connections</h2>Marshall's role in the reformation of manners was partly to act as a broker, on the one hand communicating local concerns to the magistracy and enlisting the help of local and country gentry in improving town life, and on the other propagating from the pulpit the ethical basis of vestry actions and informing the community or the particular townspeople of the consequences. In this work his connections with the puritan gentry, the &#145;noble professors&#146;, were crucial. He maintained his relations with the Barnardistons, and in 1633 preached the sermon at the funeral of Katherine, Lady Barnardiston, at St Michael Cornhill in London. In Essex his connections were more diverse. By 1628 he was a favourite in the Barrington household, receiving gifts from Joan, Lady Barrington, in the 1630s. He also won the respect of different branches of the Rich family. He preached at Maldon in 1628 before the parliamentary election in support of Sir Nathaniel Rich and was noted as foremost among &#145;those ministers who gave their voices for [Robert Rich] my lord of Warwick&#146; and those who &#145;preached often out of their parishes&#146; before the election for the Short Parliament in the spring of 1640  (Webster, <span class="italic">Marshall</span>, 17). These connections took Marshall's influence beyond the east of England; for instance, he was consulted by the godly Herefordshire gentleman Sir Robert Harley over a minister whose godly credentials seemed suspect. His connections also assisted in Marshall's career. In 1629, in the process of arranging his BD exercise, in which he preached orthodox anti-Catholicism, questions were raised regarding his MA and it became necessary to acquire a royal mandate to allow him to gain his degree. The mandate was gained at the recommendation of Sir Nathaniel Rich through his kinsman Henry Rich, earl of Holland, who was chancellor of the university. About this time Marshall married a wealthy widow, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Castell of East Hatley, Cambridgeshire, and Woodham Walter, Essex, and his wife, Elizabeth Alleyn. Her brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4865/', "Edmund Castell (bap. 1606, d. 1686)")</script>, another graduate of Emmanuel College, who went on to hold livings in Essex and Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>Marshall's contacts with, and respect from, the noble professors was matched by a similar place among puritan ministers. In the early years of his ministry Marshall was introduced to this network through Emmanuel College, through Richard Blackerby, and then through the similar spiritual exercises organized by Thomas Hooker, lecturer at Chelmsford, Essex. Marshall was one of forty-nine beneficed and &#145;conformable&#146; ministers putting their names on 10 November 1629 to a petition in favour of Hooker when he was under threat of discipline for nonconformity. In the same year Marshall was among a number of divines suspected of helping a Cambridge printer to distribute the subversive tracts of William Prynne. He may well have been the force encouraging a donor from Finchingfield for the feoffees for impropriations, an organization promoting puritan preachers.<h2>
<a name="Ministryinthe1630s"></a>Ministry in the 1630s</h2>As he matured, Marshall's prestige, combined with his organizational skills, placed him in a more central role in godly affairs. Lady Barnardiston had left provision in her will for &pound;200 to be distributed in godly causes at Marshall's advice. &pound;50 was given to Anthony Thomas to support preaching in Welsh in the principality, while &pound;150 was given in support of John Durie's scheme for spiritual union between Lutherans and Calvinists. Marshall had been involved in the latter project, an evangelical effort partly conceived to bolster orthodoxy against the advance of Laudianism, which since at least 1630 had been seen by puritans as theologically suspect. About April 1631 Durie canvassed a meeting in London and left with a testimony subscribed by thirty-eight of the leading puritan ministers committing themselves to the task of compiling the manual of practical divinity which featured in his scheme. Marshall represented Essex alongside John Rogers, the elderly lecturer of Dedham. He helped to organize a nationwide network of ministers, offering his own current work on free grace and also employing his contacts, clerical and lay, to raise funds for the cause. An unintended compliment lies within Archbishop William Laud's visitation report for 1636, in which close observation of Marshall was recommended as &#145;he governeth the consciences of all the rich Puritans in those partes, and in many places far removed&#146;  (Webster, <span class="italic">Marshall</span>, 17). His interest in Durie's work continued through the 1640s and as late as 1654 Marshall worked with presbyterians and Independents, intending to lend credibility to his plans.<br>
<br>Marshall's standing as a minister rose in the 1630s as many of his puritan colleagues were silenced or fled to the Netherlands and New England. Marshall skilfully walked the difficult line which allowed him to keep his preaching post without compromising to an extent which would lower his godly credit. When Laud, then bishop of London, conducted a visitation in 1631, godly ministers met to discuss &#145;whether it was best to let such a swine to root up God's plants in Essex, and not to give him some check&#146;  (Webster, <span class="italic">Marshall</span>, 9). Marshall was also present at the resulting demonstration but was one of the less vociferous in his protest. When he was questioned about his conformity he showed a willingness to compromise and escaped with merely a warning. He was closely watched but his circumspection was remarkably successful. In 1632 Robert Aylett, the bishop's commissary in Essex and Hertfordshire, reported that Marshall &#145;onely preacheth on the holy days and is in all very conformable&#146;  (Webster, <span class="italic">Marshall</span>, 10). In 1637 Sir Nathaniel Brent reported that he was &#145;held to be a dangerous person but exceeding cunning. Noe man doubteth but he hath an inconformable heart, but externally he observeth all&#146;  (ibid.). As Thomas Fuller's less than complimentary observation puts it, he &#145;was of so supple a soul, that he breake not a joint, yea, sprained not a sinew, in all the alteration of the times&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 52&#150;3). Marshall established his priorities: he was not prepared to place uncompromised nonconformity regarding ceremonies he regarded as <i>adiaphorous</i>, or things indifferent, before the prime goal of fervent godly preaching.<h2>
<a name="Godlyreform16401642"></a>Godly reform, 1640&#150;1642</h2>Marshall's survival within the established church allowed him to enhance his prestige as a prominent preacher around the county, to procure ministers for other vacant pulpits, and to maintain the tradition of practical divinity in the region. His reputation helps to explain how he came to the centre of parliamentarian politics in the early 1640s. In 1640 he was nominated as a preacher to the Short Parliament, renowned as a &#145;painful&#146; (i.e. painstaking) preacher but not notorious for nonconformity and thus unlikely to put a strain on the fragile alliance of conservatives and reformers. Parliament was dissolved before he had a chance to preach at a fast, but he was also nominated when parliament returned later in the year and became one of the preachers before the Commons at a solemn fast at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 17 November 1640. This was the first of many such sermons, many of which were printed. He played a crucial role in exhorting the houses to godly reform and religious conviction in their struggle with royalist forces. Between 1640 and 1653, when he delivered his last sermon to the Barebone's Parliament, sixteen such sermons were printed by order of the houses. His passion was disseminated by more than print. His most famous sermon, &#145;Meroz Cursed&#146;, first delivered to the Commons in February 1642, a characterization of passive moderates as just as guilty as active royalists, was apparently preached over sixty times.<br>
<br>Marshall became a popular preacher across London and occupied many of the most prestigious pulpits in the capital, performing at Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral as well as Marylebone, Spitalfields, and St Olave's. In early 1642 the Commons sanctioned the wish of the congregation of St Margaret's, Westminster (many of them included), to have him as one of seven ministers preaching daily in rotation at 6 a.m. with a salary of &pound;300 apiece. The Finchingfield parishioners petitioned against the arrangement and, although the petition was rejected, Marshall remained vicar of Finchingfield, with a Mr Letmale taking on most of the parochial duties as an assistant.<br>
<br>Marshall's contribution to the cause of godly reform was by no means limited to the pulpit. From November 1640 a group of godly ministers including Marshall, Cornelius Burges, John White, Matthew Newcomen, Thomas Young, and William Spurstowe had been meeting regularly at the home of Edmund Calamy senior in Aldermanbury. This group played an important role in advancing the cause. Marshall was crucial in the ministers' &#145;petition&#146; and &#145;remonstrance&#146;, signed by more than 700 clergymen and delivered to the Commons on 23 January 1641. He was named among the ministers accused by Edward Hyde, later earl of Clarendon, of having taken signatures from one document and attaching them to a different one. There was some truth in this, in that the final petition was an amalgamation of several petitions forwarded to the central committee, with specific grievances drawn together into a remonstrance comprising nearly eighty articles. There was, as Hyde later claimed, a complaint from ministers but this was merely that the length of the remonstrance would try the patience of the house.<br>
<br>Out of the same circle emerged some of the most famous pamphlets of the ecclesiological debate. Marshall's initials provided the first two letters of the authorial acronym <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94600', "Smectymnuus")</script>, the rest belonging to Calamy, Young, Newcomen, and Spurstowe. <span class="italic">An Answer</span> (1641) was an engagement with the work of Joseph Hall, then bishop of Exeter, which had defended <i>jure divino</i> episcopacy. <span class="italic">An Answer</span> is similar to the &#145;petition&#146; and the &#145;remonstrance&#146; in that it pleads for reform. It is, however, more a vigorous critique of Laudian-style episcopacy, delivered in caustic and lengthy prose, than an alternative model. At this stage Marshall was more of an advocate for a reformed, &#145;primitive&#146; episcopacy and liturgy than a presbyterian. The &#145;middle-ground&#146; outline of reduced episcopacy being cautiously circulated by James Ussher, bishop of Armagh, fed into this common area. The hopes for moderation could be seen in Marshall's being summoned by John Williams, bishop of Lincoln, to join a &#145;committee for innovations&#146; that he was chairing. The committee, appointed by the Lords on 1 March, met six times at Westminster Hall and was quite amicable, despite the presence of Hall and three of the Smectymnuans. On 12 May the committee broke up over the Commons' proposal to abolish deaneries and chapters, a sign of diminishing shared ground.<br>
<br>On 27 May the root and branch bill, for the &#145;utter abolishing&#146; of the existing episcopacy, was introduced in the Commons. On 10 June Marshall was among those present at a conference where it was decided to push the bill forward. The following day he was at the house, hurrying Simonds D'Ewes (and presumably others) into the house to contribute to the debate. Marshall was becoming more hostile to episcopacy as it stood but was not yet a &#145;full-blooded&#146; presbyterian. This can also be seen with the second Smectymnuan treatise, <span class="italic">A Vindication</span>, which appeared at the end of June. Much of the earlier work is reiterated and expanded and there are passages that seem to advocate something akin to presbyterianism but no more than that. He was testing the water very carefully: on 12 July he joined a number of English ministers dispatching a letter to the general assembly in Scotland exploring Scottish responses to Independency. He was more resolute by 22 July, joining with other ministers in writing to the general assembly again, this time expressing a desire for &#145;the Presbyterian Government, which hath just and evident Foundation, both in the Word of God and religious reason&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Proceedings of the General Assemblies</span>, 1863, 1.328). In November 1641 he was party to an agreement of puritan ministers meeting at Calamy's house to minimize ecclesiological debate within the disparate supporters of parliament in order to present a united front against episcopacy. The agreement held sway for a relatively short period.<br>
<br>As hostilities moved from rhetoric to military action Marshall became chaplain to the regiment of foot of Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, preaching to the soldiers and on 23 October 1642 riding among the troops at the battle of Edgehill, persuading the forces that God was behind them; he later wrote an account of the event. Clarendon charges him and Calibute Downing with absolving the 150 prisoners taken by the royalists at Brentford on 23 October of their oath, when released, not to bear arms against the king, although Oldmixon, with good cause, questions this story and Marshall denied this and similar allegations in print the following year in <span class="italic">A Copy of a Letter</span> (1643). He certainly justified the struggle but presented the cause as the legitimacy of parliament contesting the dangerous faction surrounding the king. However, the usual distinction between the party and the person of the monarch, which he employed, was enhanced by the starker emphasis of religion in that &#145;the question in England is whether Christ or Antichrist shall be Lord&#146;  (Marshall, <span class="italic">A Sacred Panegyric</span>, 1644, 21).<h2>
<a name="TheWestminsterassemblyandparliamentarypolitics"></a>The Westminster assembly and parliamentary politics</h2>On 12 July 1643 Marshall was among the first to be summoned to join the Westminster assembly of divines. Shortly afterwards he was dispatched to Scotland with Philip Nye as one of the assembly's commissioners. They landed at Leith on Monday 7 August and on 20 August Marshall preached in the Tron Kirk in Edinburgh to general acclaim. They both took part in the unanimous acceptance of the solemn league and covenant and returned to London in September. Marshall's stature among the puritans is further reflected in his selection as the minister to deliver the funeral sermon for John Pym in December 1643, published as <span class="italic">Threnodia</span> (1644).<br>
<br>In his work in the assembly over the following years Marshall contributed a reasonable amount of theological knowledge but mainly operated as a careful pragmatist, holding the Erastians at bay while constantly seeking, as far as was possible, accommodation with those in favour of Independent church government. On 16 December 1643 he was appointed chairman of a subcommittee of five who were to meet the Scottish delegates and prepare a directory for public worship. He drafted the section on &#145;preaching of the word&#146; which was accepted despite some reservations from the Scottish commissioners. He used his political acumen to make the resolutions as accommodating as possible. For instance, he joined with John Lightfoot to remove the prohibition on feasting on the sabbath and with George Gillespie to prevent the catechism from being too prescriptive. He drafted <span class="italic">Certaine Considerations to Diswade Men from Further Gathering of Churches</span>, a declaration issued by the assembly on 23 December 1643, discouraging the formation of Independent churches but retaining a respect for the rights of particular congregations. By early March 1644, perhaps as a response to fears of the ecclesiological m&eacute;lange in London, he made a clear statement of <i>jure divino</i> presbyterianism. However, he was still willing to respond on 20 September when the parliamentary &#145;committee of accommodation&#146; chose him to appear on a subcommittee of six clerics to devise a modus vivendi between presbyterians and Independents. Negotiations were suspended when the presbyterians demanded their own legal establishment as a preliminary to the offer of toleration for others. Marshall worked for a more accommodating system in what Robert Baillie called &#145;a middle line of his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 2.230). An openness to the Independents threatened relations with the stricter presbyterianism of the Scottish delegates.<br>
<br>A certain moderation is also evident in Marshall's sermons. At a conservative estimate he must have preached well over 1000 times between 1640 and 1649. His normal routine, even at the height of his &#145;political&#146; activism, was to preach three times a week. From February 1644 he was one of the daily speakers to parliament, leading prayers from 7.30 to 8.00 every morning. He used this opportunity to deliver a series of lectures on the sacraments, among the fruits of which were <span class="italic">A Sermon of the Baptising of Infants</span> (1644) and <span class="italic">A Defence of Infant Baptism</span> (1646). As is evident, his sermons to parliament are far from being solely the &#145;blood and thunder&#146; calls to war that might be expected. The strongest themes are pleas for unity and an appetite for religious reform at the personal and national levels. The most renowned call to war contains a more peaceful tone, one which might serve as Marshall's motto: &#145;The Church is the common storehouse to which all our wealth must be carried. Salus Ecclesiae Suprema Lex &hellip;. All our blessednesse stands or falls with the blessednesse of the Church&#146;  (Marshall, <span class="italic">Meroz Cursed</span>, 1641, 18&#150;19).<br>
<br>Parliament appointed Marshall as one of the ministers to wait on William Laud between 4 and 10 January 1645, the time between his sentencing and execution, and Marshall seems to have been present on the scaffold. Between 30 January and 18 February he attended the Uxbridge conference as a chaplain to the parliamentary commissioners and preached to them in the large room of their inn. The <i>jure divino</i> presbyterianism espoused by Marshall and his colleague Alexander Henderson left no ground for compromise with the episcopalians. Once he had returned to London, on 7 July he was chosen by the assembly to deliver the draft of church government to the Commons, and he performed the task with considerable aplomb, being careful not to test the patience of the house or to tread on sensitive Erastian toes. On 9 November the &#145;committee for accommodation&#146; was revived, and held meetings until 9 March 1646. Negotiations broke down, with the presbyterians complaining that the Independents called for a broader liberty of conscience than was appropriate; the Independents themselves could be accepted but the more extreme groups were judged to be beyond the pale.<br>
<br>On 14 March 1646 the Commons approved an ordinance naming lay commissioners in every shire and city charged with establishing presbyterian structures. Six days later Marshall presented the ordinance to a meeting of the assembly. With rare unanimity, they endorsed his view that the proposal was unacceptable and that it subverted their authority. Indeed, most of them agreed with his statement that the divines could not accept the system envisaged by the ordinance, and could not continue in the ministry with a clear conscience if it was implemented. He presented their response in a petition to the Commons on 23 March but after a lengthy debate it was judged to be a breach of privilege. He was the main force behind the petition of 29 May signed by 300 ministers of Suffolk and Essex defending clerical authority against the Erastianism of the ordinance.<br>
<br>Marshall seems never to have lost sight of the fundamental necessity of a solution which could be effected at parish level. If <i>jure divino</i> presbyterianism was not the way to achieve national salvation, then it could be sacrificed in good conscience to the greater need of practical reformation. He was not reconciled to Erastianism, although his practical experience at Finchingfield and his early fast sermons showed him to be inclined to allow the secular arm a role in reformation in partnership with the clergy. Not until near the end of his life, in a work published as <span class="italic">The Civil Magistrate</span> (1657), was he prepared to argue, from <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 49: 23 and 60: 10, that as the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> provided examples of reform led by the magistracy, so the current regime should undertake such a mission. In 1653, as in the 1640s, this was probably little more than an accommodation with the <i>status quo</i>, aided by a moderate confidence in the Cromwellian regime. Once the more Erastian system of presbyterianism was established in Essex by the end of 1647, Marshall and his assistant joined their patron in the tenth or Hinckford classis.<br>
<br>In the next two years Marshall was most visible in various parliamentary duties. He received the thanks of the assembly for his book against the Baptists. He accompanied the commissioners to Newcastle in January 1647 with Joseph Caryl, with whom he went on to act as a chaplain to the king at Holmby House, Northamptonshire, the ministers receiving &pound;500 each. The king refused to attend their sermons, and when Marshall launched into prolonged prayer before dinner expressed his impatience by saying his own grace and beginning to eat. Between February and March 1648 Marshall returned to Scotland as part of an attempt to repair the Scottish alliance, making his last recorded appearance at the assembly on 21 June when he was placed on the committee for selecting the proof texts for <i>jure divino</i> presbyterianism. He played an active role in the ecclesiological debates in the Isle of Wight from September to October, taking on the episcopalian clergy on the royalist side.<br>
<br>Marshall's part in the d&eacute;nouement of the revolution is ambiguous. He preached the sermon to the Commons two days after Pride's Purge, but Hamon L'Estrange's allegation that he was one of the justifiers of the king's execution seems groundless. More reliable is the assertion of Giles Firmin that he was &#145;so troubled about the king's death&#146; that on Sunday 28 January 1648, he interceded with the heads of the army, &#145;and had it not been for one whom I will not name, who was very opposite and unmovable, he would have persuaded Cromwell to save the king. This is true&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>Marshall was never so central a figure after 1649 although it cannot be said that he withdrew from politics. Indeed, he preached at least once to the Rump Parliament and in April 1649 he was employed along with Caryl, Nye, and others in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the members excluded to resume their places in parliament. In the following year, temporarily at least, his attention turned to lesser duties. He established funds for his earlier haunts in giving a &#145;messuage and tenement&#146; with &#145;Boynton meadow, containing three acres&#146; worth &pound;2 a year to pay for wood for the poor of Finchingfield and gave &#145;Great Wingey, a nominal manor&#146; to fund a lecture at Wethersfield. It is as though he was &#145;closing his accounts&#146; in Essex, and, for reasons which are not quite clear, he did indeed leave Finchingfield in 1651, becoming town preacher at Ipswich, Suffolk, based in St Mary's at the Quay. On Easter Monday 1652, however, he was again in London, preaching to the lord mayor and aldermen; when the sermon was published he was still described as minister at Finchingfield.<br>
<br>In November 1653 Marshall met with Cromwell and others in an attempt to persuade Blackfriars millenarians to moderate their language. Three days later he preached to the Barebone's Parliament with an ecclesiology well suited to his congregation. Late in 1653 he was one of the commissioners appointed by parliament to draw up the &#145;fundamentals of religion&#146; as part of the loose-limbed ecumenism of the 1650s. On 20 March 1654 he was appointed as one of the &#145;triers&#146;, men given the task of assessing and accepting or rejecting candidates for ministerial posts. He was working with a fairly broad spectrum of ministers, from reconciled presbyterians like himself to baptists such as Henry Jessey.<br>
<br>Marshall's health was declining&#151;he was beginning to suffer from gout. About the middle of 1655 he lost the use of his hands to the disease and started to suffer from consumption. He died at Ipswich on 19 November 1655 with Giles Firmin at his side. He was given a prestigious funeral and resting place, being buried on 23 November in the south aisle of Westminster Abbey with great solemnity. He rested for only six years in this grave as his remains were taken up on 14 September 1661 and cast into a pit at the back door of the prebendary's lodgings in St Margaret's churchyard.<br>
<br>Marshall's wife, who had predeceased him, had exercised her power of disposal of her estate to their children. Their only son had drowned at Hamburg, and of their six daughters, three died before their father, including Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1654), who had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20415/', "John Nye (bap. 1620, d. 1686?)")</script>, nephew of Marshall's colleague <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20417/', "Philip Nye")</script>. Their daughters Mary, wife of Thomas Langham, and Susanna proved the will.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Many of the surviving accounts and appraisals of Marshall date from immediately after the Restoration, so it comes as no surprise that the vast majority are negative. Writers such as Peter Heylyn, Anthony Wood, Laurence Echard, and Zachery Wood have clear reasons for animosity, while more rigid presbyterians such as Robert Baillie regarded him as a traitor. Clarendon, despite his own, more graceful, invective, gives a rather more careful assessment, particularly in his remark that &#145;the archbishop of Canterbury had never so great an influence upon the counsels at court as Dr [Cornelius] Burges and Mr Marshall had then upon the Houses&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.401). In contrast, Samuel Pepys, taking a certain satisfaction that they had fallen so low, reported that two of Marshall's surviving daughters had become actresses at the king's theatre; while the women in question were indeed daughters of a clergyman called Marshall, they were not the daughters of Stephen Marshall. His first biographers emerged in the charged atmosphere of the exclusion crisis, and were heavily influenced by news of history then current. <span class="italic">The Godly Man's Legacy to the Saints</span> (1680) is written by someone who evidently knew Marshall from his career as a minister in Essex and has some trustworthy biographical details albeit ones with an attached anti-fanatic twist. The response, by Marshall's close friend Giles Firmin, &#145;Vindication of Stephen Marshall&#146;, is rarely guilty of idolization but still has to be read in the political climate of the early 1680s and its debates on the consequences of the civil war. The fact that biographies, hostile and sympathetic alike, should be produced in this context is testament to Marshall's stature. He occupied an important place in the religious politics of the 1640s and remained a useful figure for laudatory accounts of godliness and hostile accounts of fanaticism more than two decades after his death.<br>
