<span class="headword">Forrest,  John</span>, first Baron Forrest  (1847&#150;1918), <span class="occ">explorer and politician in Australia</span>, third son of the ten children born to William Forrest (1819&#150;1899), farmer and millwright, of Preston Point, near Bunbury, Western Australia (who had migrated from Stonehaven, Kincardineshire), and his wife, Margaret Guthrie (1821&#150;1895), daughter of David Hill, of Dundee, was born on 22 August 1847 at Preston Point. After attending the government school in Bunbury and Bishop Hale's School, Perth, and having been apprenticed as a surveyor from 1863, he entered the survey department of the colony in 1865. He soon showed conspicuous skill at exploration: first in 1869, when he led a search for the remains of the lost Ludwig Leichhardt; then in 1870, when he travelled overland from Perth to Adelaide, establishing a reliable overland telegraph route; and, most notably, in 1874, by his expedition from Geraldton to the overland telegraph line between Adelaide and Port Darwin, a distance of 2000 miles through the central desert country. He was f&ecirc;ted in Australia and London, received a freehold grant of 5000 acres and the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical Society, and was appointed deputy surveyor-general in 1876. On 29 February 1876, at St George's Cathedral, Perth, he married Margaret Elvire (1844&#150;1929), daughter of Edward Hamersley of Guildford, Western Australia. Wealthy and well connected, she proved a great asset to his political career, although the couple were childless.<br>
<br>In 1883 Forrest was promoted surveyor-general and commissioner of crown lands with a seat in the executive and legislative councils. He proved as thorough and thoughtful an administrator as he had been an explorer, although he was not immune from the endemic quarrels in the administration. When the colony was granted responsible government in 1890, he formed its first ministry, as treasurer with the unofficial title of &#145;premier&#146;. In ten years Forrest's administration oversaw the construction of almost 2000 miles of railway and many important public works including Freemantle harbour and the 350 mile pipeline supplying 6 million gallons of water daily to the Coolgardie&#150;Kalgoorlie goldfields, discovered in 1892&#150;3. These projects increased colonial debt sevenfold, but, helped by the gold, Forrest transformed a huge pastoral expanse with a few transitory miners into a prosperous colony with settled rural, mining, and urban populations. His <span class="roman">Homestead Act</span> (1893) instituted free land grants of 160 acres to those wanting to settle, and he founded the Agricultural Bank in 1894 to extend credit to agriculturists for improvements. He improved the rights of industrial, mining, and shop workers, and of women in general, abolished state aid to religion, and tightened the restrictions on immigration from Asia. He represented Western Australia at the colonial conferences in London in 1887 and 1897, playing a prominent part in each. He worked steadily for Australian federation, and although his caution looked to some like reluctance, he finally led the campaign for popular acceptance of the federal constitution.<br>
<br>In February 1901 Forrest left state politics to join the first commonwealth administration. He held office in three non-Labor governments, before resigning in 1907 from a ministry which had become dependent on Labor support in parliament. Having been active in discussions among non-Labor members, he returned as treasurer in the new Liberal Party &#145;fusion&#146; administration, and negotiated improved financial arrangements between the commonwealth and the states. He was narrowly defeated four times in party elections for leader, and thereby for prime minister, but was treasurer again in 1913&#150;14 and 1917&#150;18, before cancer forced his resignation in 1918. Already appointed a KCMG in 1891 and a GCMG in 1901, in 1918 he was created Baron Forrest of Bunbury, the first peerage bestowed on an Australian politician; but while bound for England to take his seat in the House of Lords and to seek medical advice, he died at sea on 3 September 1918 off Sierra Leone. He was buried in the Karrakatta cemetery, Perth. He left an estate worth &pound;45,000.<br>
<br>Although by 1918 Forrest's political style seemed outmoded in the era of national party politics, he left a lasting legacy of social and economic advances and physical infrastructure. His achievements at Perth were not matched by those in federal politics, but within and beyond Australia he won lasting renown as an explorer and practical geographer, convinced that rational resource exploitation based on accurate survey and mapping was the only scientific and coherent means to develop a new nation.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_41225"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Forrest</span>  (1849&#150;1901), <span class="occ">surveyor and entrepreneur</span>, John Forrest's brother, was born on 22 September 1849 at Preston Point, near Bunbury, in Western Australia. He attended the same schools as his brother and also trained as a surveyor. Not so accomplished a surveyor as John, he was the more adventurous explorer. He accompanied John in his expeditions of 1870 and 1874 and himself led a party past Coolgardie and south to Esperance Bay in 1871, forming an overfavourable opinion of that district. In 1879 he led a brilliant expedition in the north of Western Australia, with a party which included his brother Matthew, when he discovered and named the Kimberley district and a huge tract of well-watered grazing lands on the Fitzroy and Ord rivers. Having, like John, already been criticized for profiting from his discoveries, he resigned his government appointment to become an extremely successful land agent in the south-west and particularly in the Kimberleys, attracting investment, settlement, and railway construction, and himself setting up a number of concerns and becoming very wealthy. There were complaints against some of his business practices, but he was never found to have broken the law. On 15 January 1880 he married Amy-Eliza (1852&#150;1897), daughter of Edward Thomas Barret-Lennard; they had four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>An ardent supporter of responsible government and protectionism, Forrest represented Kimberley in the legislative council from 1887. After responsible government was granted he sat in the assembly from 1890 to 1901, strongly opposing federation. As mayor of Perth in 1892&#150;5 and in 1897&#150;1900 he used his connections with his brother to win government subsidies for public works in the city, although in general he was a firmer believer in private enterprise than John, who increasingly advocated government planning in developing public lands. Appointed a CMG in May 1901, Alexander died on 20 June, in Perth, from a kidney disease; he was buried in Karrakatta cemetery, Perth, on the 21st. He left an estate worth &pound;195,000, but also a lasting legacy in the settlements and landholdings he laid out in the north-west of Australia.<br>
