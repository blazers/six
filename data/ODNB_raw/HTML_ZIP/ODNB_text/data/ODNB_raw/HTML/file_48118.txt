<span class="headword">Wheeler, Sir  Arthur</span>, baronet  (1860&#150;1943), <span class="occ">stockbroker and corporate financier</span>, was born at Derby Road, Nottingham, on 18 September 1860, the son of Benjamin Wheeler, a heating engineer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Radford. He was educated at Nottingham high school (1871&#150;6) and spent his early business career with Simon, Meyer &amp; Co. (later Simon, May &amp; Co.), a rapidly growing Anglo-German merchant house which exported lace to Russia, Latin America, and other overseas markets. He was quick with figures and rose to be chief clerk. In 1896 he married Mary, the daughter of Frederick Pullman, a Nottingham JP; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1899 Wheeler, together with Arthur Blake, launched his own business in Leicester as Blake and Wheeler, stockbrokers. The partnership was not a member of the stock exchange and so not subject to its restrictive practices. By doing business as jobbers&#151;then a separate occupation&#151;the partners were able to buy stock and shares and to advertise for business by circulating clients (customers) or potential buyers. The partnership was dissolved in 1910, when Blake became a member of the Nottingham stock exchange (later, as Sir Arthur Blake, he was its chairman). Wheeler continued in Leicester as what was called an outside broker.<br>
<br>Wheeler's success was based on his recognition that in provincial towns such as Leicester, Birmingham, and Nottingham there were many substantial shareholdings from deceased estates languishing on the market. The handful of small local brokers in such places lacked the organization to market them because they were not allowed, by stock exchange rules, to make any kind of approach to potential clients. Very often such shareholdings were in sound local industrial and commercial enterprises that were nevertheless too small to find recognition in the City of London, where stockbrokers were slow to respond to the opportunities offered by smaller companies. Wheeler conceived the idea of mailing advertisement circulars on a selective basis to people who had the specific interest to understand the value of these shares and the means to purchase them. Thus his circulars for shares in drapery stores went to drapers, for breweries to publicans, for shares in hosiery and knitwear companies to people prominent in the midlands textile industry, and so forth. The result of this careful targeting of mailshots was a high response rate, with most of Wheeler's acquisitions being taken up very quickly and few shares left over. Other entrepreneurs imitated Wheeler but the biggest of them did not do one-twentieth of his business, so there was little effective competition for him.<br>
<br>Wheeler steadily built up what would now be called a large database of customers, fed by shareholders' names from the companies registration office. In the early 1920s the list topped a quarter of a million names, and by the end of the decade it had reached three-quarters of a million. With such a rapidly growing clientele, Wheeler was able to circulate prospectuses of new issues and take large shareholdings in them. His marketing strength was such that if he recommended a new share issue a buoyant sale was assured, and several investment institutions sought his imprimatur before taking large lots from the merchant banks responsible for the issue. Beechams' share issue of 1927, to take just one example, could not have been undertaken without Wheeler's backing; in the event it was oversubscribed.<br>
<br>Wheeler's growing familiarity with the needs of small companies and small investors led to further developments in the 1920s. In 1924 he launched a new venture in the City of London, the Gresham Investment Trust, to make small industrial issues, and the following year the Charterhouse Investment Trust Ltd, to undertake larger share issues. The City establishment did not altogether approve of Wheeler, but the two enterprises came to be recognized as pioneers in bridging what later (1931) became known as &#145;the Macmillan gap&#146;&#151;the absence of financial organizations with the expertise to finance smaller businesses. In this period Wheeler became chairman or a director of a number of companies that he helped to finance, including Beecham Estates and Pills (then being built up by Philip Hill), Rolls Razor, Low Temperature Carbonization, United Drapery Stores, and the British Hosiery Trust, an attempt to amalgamate Wolsey, Byfords, and several other Leicester firms.<br>
<br>Wheeler was created a baronet in 1920 for his work in selling war bonds, to which he devoted his entire energy during the First World War. He found time in his long working days for public and charitable causes, and was a generous subscriber to numerous local causes. He recruited several managers of outstanding ability, some of whom maintained the momentum of his financial initiatives after 1931; in particular Sir Nutcombe Hume (1893&#150;1967) built up Charterhouse (later Charterhouse Japhet) as a leading investment house, while John Kinross (1904&#150;1989) used his early career experience with Gresham to develop the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Ltd (ICFC), the leading post-war investment bank for small firms, later called Investors for Industry or 3 i.<br>
<br>As Wheeler's business increased, he found it necessary to finance it by bank overdrafts secured by the deposit of stocks and shares. This was easy while shares held their value, but the collapse in prices in 1929 compelled the banks to call for a reduction in overdrafts or increase in collateral, at which point Wheeler became embarrassed for want of working capital. Matters came to a head early in 1931, when he had no funds to pay for a war loan conversion for which he had accepted numerous orders and payments, and he filed his petition for bankruptcy in March. In October he was tried at Leicester assizes for fraudulent conversion and gaoled for twelve months. As an undischarged bankrupt, Wheeler was unable to rebuild his business, and was forced to retire to Norfolk. He died at Home Farm, Holme next the Sea, on 20 May 1943, following a cerebral thrombosis.<br>
