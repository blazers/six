<span class="headword">O'Neill, Sir  Phelim Roe <span class="st"> [Felim Ruadh]</span></span>  (1603&#150;1653), <span class="occ">landowner and insurgent</span>, was the eldest son of Tirlough Oge O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1608), landowner and heir to Sir Henry Oge O'Neill of Kinnard from co. Tyrone, and Catherine, daughter of Tirlough McHenry O'Neill of the Fews. This parentage reflected the intra-sept rivalries that consumed the northern O'Neills.<h2>
<a name="Originsearlylifeandcareer"></a>Origins, early life, and career</h2>Sir Henry Oge O'Neill's marriage to Catherine, daughter of Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, fed the pretensions of the family. Towards the end of the Nine Years' War, Henry Oge, sometimes called &#145;the queen's O'Neill&#146;, deserted Tyrone in the hope of holding his estates directly from the crown. This strategy was shared by Tirlough McHenry O'Neill of the Fews. Drawn together by their shared post-war ambitions, Henry Oge's son married Tirlough McHenry's daughter Catherine. This lineage provided Phelim Roe and his brother with autonomy in the unsettled native north, but Henry Oge paid a high price for his prominence and the schism it provoked. On 20 June 1608 both Henry Oge and his son Tirlough Oge were killed in the king's service during the ill-fated O'Dogherty revolt. The crown, reacting to the troubled condition of Ulster, attempted to reassert control by nurturing the northern Irish who had remained loyal. Towards this end, the lord deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester, violated the laws of succession and turned over parts of Henry Oge's estate to Phelim's uncles and cousins who otherwise threatened to be &#145;thorns in our feet and pricks in our side&#146;  (Chichester to Davies, 31 March 1609, TNA: PRO, SP 63/226/58, 154). In March 1609 an inquisition resolved the inheritance issue by recognizing the five and a half-year-old Phelim Roe as the heir to his grandfather's remaining lands. In 1613 his mother was granted a patent for custody of the newly created manor of Kinnard during Phelim's minority.<br>
<br>Raised as a royal ward in conformity with the principles of &#145;piety and civility&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1615&#150;16</i>, 346), in 1618 O'Neill and his brother Tirlough Oge enrolled at Lincoln's Inn, London, the former staying there for three years. His return to Ireland coincided with the expiration of his mother's patent and his coming of age. Although he took the oath of supremacy, he lapsed back to his native Catholicism after the 1628 &#145;graces&#146;, or religious concessions, modified the oath to one of allegiance. He also petitioned for a new grant for his grandfather's estates. On 6 May 1629 the king's council, anxious to sustain O'Neill's loyalty during England's war with Spain, ordered a new patent for much of Sir Henry's lands, estimated at 4500 acres. That same year O'Neill enhanced his standing in Ulster by marrying the daughter of Arthur Magennis, Viscount Magennis of Iveagh. But he lacked the discretion to conduct himself properly, and &#145;ran into all the follies and extravagances of youth&#146;  (Carte, 1.158). His intemperate lifestyle, &#145;as free and generous as could be desired&#146;  (Hogan, 148), could not keep pace with the inflationary age. Moreover, the purchase of his knighthood, a wartime assessment, and the settlement to the crown of the value of his wardship and marriage were unavoidable expenditures. His only recourse was to heavily mortgage his estates. A 1661 inquisition stated that by 1640 he owed over &pound;12,000 to Dublin and London creditors.<br>
<br>This not uncommon plight did not detract from O'Neill's regional prominence. A Tyrone&#150;Armagh notable, he served as a local JP, sat in the Irish parliament for Dungannon in 1641, and through his brother's marriage had ties to the MacDonnells of Antrim. It was through the earl of Antrim's influence in 1639 that he gained his knighthood. Like many others in Ireland, O'Neill was alarmed by the uncompromising policies of the lord deputy, Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, whose regime exposed the vulnerability of Irish tenurial, legal, and religious rights. His assault on traditional sources of Irish power moved O'Neill and others like him to fear that an ascendant English protestant parliament would use Strafford's policies to undermine their place in the post-plantation north. To protect their positions and redress former grievances, O'Neill and other Catholic landholders sought ways to preserve, not overthrow, the colonial system that gave them status and influence.<h2>
<a name="Conspiracies1641"></a>Conspiracies, 1641</h2>Having attempted to use the Irish parliament to work out constitutional safeguards, Irish politicians failed to resolve their grievances and, moved by the success of the insurgents in Scotland, turned to more militant remedies. Initially O'Neill kept his distance from the conspirators, wary of risking his fragile position on the early plots of Lord Maguire and Rory O'More, although his brother informed him of the progress of their machinations. But his rank among the Ulster O'Neills made his support essential for any action in the native north. It was not until the spring of 1641 that he stepped up his role, as witnessed by his contacts with native commanders and kinsmen in the Spanish service. The key factor for the plotters was the fate of Strafford's Irish Catholic army that was raised to support the king against the covenanting Scots.<br>
<br>With the death of John O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, in 1641, Sir Phelim, identified in the plotters' codes as &#145;President Rosse&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">A Contemporary History</span>, 1/2.397), increased his communications with his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20783/', "Colonel Owen Roe O'Neill")</script> in the Spanish Netherlands. This urgency came after the disbandment on 25 May 1641 of Strafford's Catholic army. With parliament unwilling to tolerate unemployed Catholic troops in Ireland, the king directed the earl of Antrim to issue licences to designated Catholic recruiter-colonels for the purpose of maintaining the Irish army. In this context, a royalist conspiracy, termed the &#145;Antrim plot&#146; or &#145;colonels' plot&#146; evolved. O'Neill was not an immediate participant. Having worked in the Irish parliament to keep the soldiers together, he already had contact with Owen Roe and native officers on the continent. It was natural that he would attach himself to the original O'More and Maguire conspirators who at this point were plotting with the colonels to seize Dublin Castle and overthrow the pro-parliament regime.<br>
<br>O'Neill was briefed about the conspiracy at his wife's funeral in 1641. With assurances from Owen Roe's agents, he followed his confederates to Dublin to meet spokesmen from the colonels. The colonels, however, &#145;were fallen from their resolution&#146;  (Hickson, 2.349) because of the crown's accommodations with the Scots. Undeterred by the loss of the colonels, &#145;the fools&#146;, as Antrim described the native plotters, &#145;would not accept our time and manner for ordering the work; but fell upon it without us and sooner and otherwise than we should have done&#146;  (Cox, appx, xlix). O'Neill and the original plotters professed that they were acting in the king's best interest and planned an attack on Dublin Castle for 23 October 1641. O'Neill, preferring a contained provincial rising, concentrated his forces in Ulster. On the day preceding the general insurrection he took Charlemont Castle and a host of other fortifications. Always conscious of justifying his actions and broadening his support, he later asserted that the Ulster rising was for the &#145;liberty of religion and for the recovery of those lands which should appear by the law of the land to be unjustly held from the native Irish&#146;  (TCD, MS 839, fol. 3). This justification was anticipated in his Dungannon proclamation of 24 October, which professed that the uprising was not directed against the king and that no harm would come to the Scots Irish. The sole motive, O'Neill said, was the &#145;defense and liberty of ourselves and the Irish natives of this kingdom&#146;  (proclamation, 24 Oct 1641, TNA: PRO, SP 63/260/27, 135). A few weeks later he published a forged royal commission authorizing him to rise up against parliament in support of Irish liberties. None of these validations won over the Scottish settlers, nor did they pacify the outbreak of long-suffering discontent.<br>
<br>Despite his provincial prominence, O'Neill was neither a trained military commander nor a conciliatory leader. He had envisaged a limited rising, not a rebellion that vented popular grievances. He based his actions on a network of kinship groups and affiliates who failed him when local authority broke down. In the anarchic wake, his misconceived expectations suffered from factional self-interests and the disparagement of his intentions. Branded a traitor with a &pound;1000 reward on his head, he was often held responsible for many of the post-rising excesses. He did try to establish military order in the chaotic north, but with few resources and untrained troops his successes were limited. He took the town of Lurgan and ventured into west Tyrone and seized Strabane Castle, wasting the countryside, before being repulsed by Sir William Stewart and his protestant Lagan forces. O'Neill's greatest effort was the attempted capture of Drogheda in early 1642. The county of Meath made him general of the forces and gave him governing authority during the campaign, but neither these efforts nor his forays against the Scots in counties Down and Antrim were successful. He narrowly escaped capture and later eluded the veteran Scottish commander Robert Monro, who had landed with a Scottish army in the spring of 1642, by burning Armagh and fleeing to Charlemont. By the early summer he had lost possession of Fort Mountjoy, Dungannon, Strabane, and Kinnard and was soundly defeated by the Lagan forces at Glenamaquin, near Raphoe. With his resources and leadership waning, he attended a provincial council meeting at Glaslough. It was here on 18 July that a courier announced that Owen Roe O'Neill had arrived on the coast of Donegal with men and supplies from the continent.<h2>
<a name="OwenRoeONeillandtheconfederateCatholics"></a>Owen Roe O'Neill and the confederate Catholics</h2>O'Neill set out with a large contingent to meet and escort Owen Roe O'Neill to Charlemont. They arrived on 13 August to a great celebration. According to an eyewitness, everyone received Owen Roe with bare heads except Sir Phelim. This response portended a leadership struggle between the deposed natives and &#145;deserving&#146; Irish at a general assembly convened at Clones on 29 August 1642. At this gathering, the delegates, particularly the dispossessed Irish, rallied around and acknowledged Owen Roe as their commander; they conferred upon him the title of lord-general. No reference was made to the earldom of Tyrone, to which Sir Phelim allegedly aspired. Facing up to the north's dire condition and the popular appeal of Owen's generalship, Phelim hesitantly stepped aside and was appeased with the perfunctory title of lord president of Ulster. After the assembly he accompanied Owen Roe to Kilkenny to attend the inauguration of the new Catholic confederation. Representing Ulster on the supreme council, O'Neill, &#145;puffed by emulation&#146; and caught up by the intrigue at the capital, pursued opportunities to strengthen his deflated position. He not only opposed his kinsman's selection as the chief commander of the confederate forces, he also tried to outmanoeuvre him by marrying, in October 1642, Louise (1623/4&#150;<i>c</i>.1649), the eighteen-year-old daughter of Owen's lifelong military adversary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22731/', "Thomas Preston")</script>. The marriage strengthened him with a dowry of muskets, arms, and &pound;3000. The Franciscan Hugh Bourke, writing to Rome, warned that the Irish cause would suffer unless the differences between Sir Phelim and Owen Roe were healed.<br>
<br>In the years and campaigns that followed, O'Neill busied himself with affairs in Kilkenny and Charlemont. He consolidated his military position and promoted himself as an alternative to his cousin. Lacking siege weaponry, he posed no threat to the north's fortified places, but venturing into Meath with Owen Roe's army he occupied the well-situated castles. During the failed confederate campaign of 1644 against the covenanting armies of Ulster, he remained in Kilkenny and took the confederate government's side against Owen Roe by turning Charlemont over to the campaign's commander, the earl of Castlehaven. His political connivances were eventually constrained in October 1645 by the arrival of a papal nuncio, Giovanni Rinuccini. Concerned about the confederate Catholics' lack of success, particularly in Ulster, Rinuccini focused his attention on the &#145;irreconcilable enmity&#146; between Owen and Phelim. Owen Roe and his clerical adviser, Ever MacMahon, bishop of Clogher, lost no time accepting the nuncio's mediation. Sir Phelim, not wanting to lose the church's support, followed suit and was granted an all-embracing pardon for his actions. After the reconciliation the northern army received papal succour that allowed them to move against the covenanters. At the battle of Benburb, on 5 June 1646, Sir Phelim's ten-company regiment followed the command of Owen Roe. He and his forces gave a good account of themselves and settled old scores, taking no prisoners.<br>
<br>O'Neill used the Benburb triumph to accumulate provisions and expand his holdings. He also accompanied Owen Roe to Kilkenny to support a clerical-led coup against the confederate government, who had accepted peace terms considered to include unsatisfactory religious guarantees from the king's lord lieutenant, the marquess of Ormond. Unable to withstand Rinuccini's censure or Owen Roe's power, O'Neill righted himself by serving on a reconstituted supreme council more amenable to clerical aims. Operating under clerical duress, he took over the strategic garrison at Maryborough, as Owen Roe and the coerced Thomas Preston marched against Dublin, held by Ormond. The deposed Old English supporters of the peace with Ormond countered this offensive with divisive appeals to the royalism of Thomas Preston and the ambitions of &#145;deserving&#146; Irishmen such as O'Neill.<br>
<br>The failure of the 1647 Dublin campaign, the overthrow of the clerical regime, and the discrediting of Owen Roe O'Neill allowed Sir Phelim O'Neill to make amends with the crown's representatives. He knew his advancement was tied to the royalist cause and was not willing to jeopardize his rank and estates for the desperate politics of dispossessed natives or the hard-line expectations of Tridentine continental clergy. Back in the good graces of the king, he dissembled against Owen Roe and drew away key officers such as Lord Iveagh, Myles O'Reilly, and Alexander MacDonnell. By the summer of 1648 he was in a position to ignore Owen Roe's military directives and resisted his call to arms. In the early autumn he settled his differences with Ormond and was appointed a peace commissioner. He was promised a title and an expansion of his estates and was made governor of Charlemont and commander of a regiment of foot. Hoping to rekindle his primacy under a royal&#150;confederate settlement, he continued to disparage Owen Roe and obstruct the general's negotiations with Ormond and the king. About this time he married Lady Jean (<i>d</i>. in or after 1668), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11036/', "George Gordon, first marquess of Huntly")</script>, and widow of Claud Hamilton, first Lord Hamilton, baron of Strabane. Their younger son was named <a href="#cosubject_20770">Gordon [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<h2>
<a name="Disasterdeathandreputation"></a>Disaster, death, and reputation</h2>O'Neill's last hope for command occurred after Owen Roe's death (6 November 1649), when the northern leaders assembled at Belturbet in March 1650 to elect a new general of the northern army. However, not only did Sir Phelim lack the respect of Owen Roe's followers, but also a proviso in the articles of peace excluded the candidacy of any officer who had deserted the northern army in 1648. In the end, his old nemesis, Ever MacMahon, bishop of Clogher, was selected bishop-general. A week later, after acts of penance, O'Neill and his compatriots made a formal submission to MacMahon. Unfortunately, the inexperienced bishop-general led the northern army into a disastrous defeat at Scariffhollis on 21 June 1651. O'Neill escaped to co. Tyrone, where he defended Charlemont Castle against the forces of parliament. After surrendering the fortress he fled, leaving his pregnant wife behind for her own safety. He was branded a traitor and criminal, and in August 1652 the Cromwellian regime offered a &pound;300 reward for his apprehension. Six months later O'Neill's hiding place on an island on Lough Roughan in Tyrone was betrayed. He was taken to Dublin, and on 5 March 1653 was put on trial before the high court of justice. Offered a pardon if he admitted the authenticity of the bogus 1641 royal commission, O'Neill refused to implicate the executed Charles I, knowing it might later be held against his wife or heirs. Five days later, in Dublin, on 10 March 1653, he was found guilty and was hanged, drawn, and quartered. His remains were impaled on the gates of Lisnegarvy, Dundalk, Drogheda, and Dublin.<br>
<br>O'Neill has been made the scapegoat for the 1641 rebellion. The sectarian propaganda of the civil war era portrayed him as a villainous rebel, the man behind the undisciplined fury of the Ulster uprising. He was also stigmatized by the clerical party who rallied around Owen Roe O'Neill. His agenda and survival tactics were hardly ever accepted or respected by them. On the other hand, his aspirations to land and status were better appreciated by royalist and Old English confederate parties as a counterforce against the native and religious militants. In the end, he became a vilified and maligned historical figure, a casualty of his post-plantation ambitions.<br>
<br>Contemporary accounts of the rebellion and the civil war did little to redeem O'Neill's reputation. His ambitions and intentions suffered further in the depositions taken after the Ulster rising. In many cases, he was blamed for the revolt's excesses and was accused of being a particularly vengeful leader. Historians of the later twentieth century have proved more objective in their treatments, but are still obliged to draw their conclusions from the same critical sources. For O'Neill, the problem will always be one of appreciating his circuitous and unrelenting struggle to secure his position in the unstable kaleidoscope that was colonial Ulster.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20770"></a><span class="headword">Gordon O'Neill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1652&#150;1705), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the younger son of Sir Phelim Roe O'Neill and his third wife, Jean, was named for his mother's family, but lived in the shadow of his father's 1641 infamy. The capture and subsequent execution of his father by the Cromwellians came about when he attempted to communicate with his wife, who was caring for the infant Gordon in their confinement at Charlemont Castle. His fate was also affected by the actions of his older half-brother, James Hamilton, baron of Strabane. Hamilton had joined Phelim Roe and the Catholic royalists in 1649 and as a Roman Catholic recusant forfeited his land to the Commonwealth in June 1655. With declining prospects, Gordon O'Neill and his mother made the necessary accommodations. Gordon was raised outside his faith, never learned the Irish language  (P. Walsh, 92), and married &#145;a Protestant lady&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) from the city of Derry with whom he had at least two children, Catherine and Gordon. Eventually the young O'Neill returned to Catholicism, lived in Derry, and served as a captain of grenadiers in the infantry regiment of William Stewart, Lord Mountjoy. A favoured officer, he was made lord lieutenant of Tyrone and sat for the county in the parliament of 1689. Fighting for the Jacobite Catholic&#150;royalist cause in the Williamite Wars, he led a regiment of foot in many critical campaigns. He participated in the siege and blockade of Derry and was wounded in the thigh. O'Neill and his regiment were reassigned to Drogheda and fought on 12 July 1690 in the battle of the Boyne. Afterwards, he fell back with the Jacobite forces towards the Shannon River and defended the city of Limerick. A year later he was with the French commander St Ruth, near Athlone, when the Dutch General Ginkel soundly defeated the Jacobite forces at the battle of Aughrim. O'Neill and his regiment fought well, but he was severely wounded and was left for dead on the battlefield. Fortunately, he was recognized by Scottish relatives among the Williamite soldiers and was taken to Dublin.<br>
<br>After his recovery O'Neill took advantage of the treaty of Limerick and joined thousands of Irish soldiers who departed for France. He became a colonel of the Irish Charlemont regiment. They were part of the Irish brigade, wearing British uniforms and serving the kings of France. From 1692 to 1697 he fought with distinction in the French service. Following the treaty of Ryswick, the remnant of his regiment was re-formed and reassembled into an infantry regiment under Pierce Butler, styled Viscount Galmoye. O'Neill rose to the rank of brigadier-general, but before his death in France in early 1705, he was negotiating to raise a regiment for the service of Spain.<br>
<br>O'Neill's daughter Catherine married John Bourke, styled fourth Baron Bourke of Brittas and eighth Baron Bourke of Castle Connell. His son Gordon fought in the Spanish service as a captain in an Irish regiment of dragoons. His older stepbrother Phelim, son of Phelim Roe and Louise Preston, became a Franciscan and returned to Ireland in 1671&#150;2. He was appointed guardian of the convent of Armagh and visitor in Ulster. A controversial figure, he returned to the continent and actively served the church on political missions.<br>
