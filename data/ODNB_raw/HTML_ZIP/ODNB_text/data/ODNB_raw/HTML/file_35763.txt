<span class="headword">Ritchie,  David George</span>  (1853&#150;1903), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 26 October 1853 at the manse in Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, the first of three children of Elizabeth Bradfute Dudgeon and her husband, the Revd Dr George Ritchie, Presbyterian minister and moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. His was a family long linked to scholarly pursuits; he numbered among his relatives Sir William Hamilton's predecessor in the chair of logic at the University of Edinburgh, Dr David Ritchie, who was noted both for his sweeping exclusion of metaphysics from his teaching and for being &#145;more illustrious on the curling pond than in the professorial chair&#146;  (A. Grant, <span class="italic">The Story of the University of Edinburgh</span>, 1884). Another family member, the Revd David Aitken, travelled to Germany in 1826 to visit Schleiermacher, Hegel, Neander, and Schlegel, and recorded his impressions in a diary which D. G. Ritchie subsequently published. The family was also connected to the Carlyles.<br>
<br>Ritchie was a frail and bookish child. Discouraged from associating with the town's children, he was nurtured in the quiet of the manse. Fishing and reading were his primary pastimes. He began study at the Jedburgh Academy, where he quickly showed proofs of his scholarly inclination, and proceeded to Edinburgh University, where he read psychology, logic, and metaphysics with Campbell Fraser, moral philosophy (including Kant) with Henry Calderwood, and Greek with J. S. Blackie. It was here that he was introduced to philosophers who were to influence the direction of his own philosophical thought, most notably Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Sir William Hamilton, and J. S. Mill. As an active member of the university philosophical society, Ritchie presented and discussed papers on such philosophical problems as the intuitionist theory of moral conduct, Hamilton's theory of causation, and Kantian objectivity. Ritchie enjoyed an illustrious undergraduate career, during which he won medals in Latin, Greek, logic, metaphysics, and moral philosophy. He graduated MA in 1875 with first-class honours, and was awarded the Scottish universities' classical scholarship. This was awarded for the first time in 1875 to the head man of the four Scottish universities; Ritchie was easily judged the most worthy candidate.<br>
<br>Like other promising Scottish students, Ritchie went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he held an exhibition. The college provided a vibrant and dynamic environment for the young scholar, characterized as it was by Jowett's cultivation of Platonic studies and public service, and by T. H. Green's development of idealist philosophy. Tutored by Benjamin Jowett, Green, R. L. Nettleship, and A. C. Bradley, Ritchie not only earned a first in classical moderations (1875) and in the final school of Greats (1878), but more importantly, he developed two abiding interests: philosophical idealism and social reform.<br>
<br>By the end of his studies, Ritchie had become sceptical of religious doctrines, and felt unable to take holy orders as his family had long planned. Instead he read for the English bar, thinking that he could there pursue his interest in political philosophy. But though elements of legal theory interested him, he had no desire to practise as a barrister and accepted the offer of a tutorship at Jesus College, Oxford, where he was elected to a fellowship in 1878, convinced that students and teachers of politics were better equipped than constitutional lawyers to inquire into political thought. Despite heavy teaching obligations as a tutor at Jesus, as a temporary tutor at both Balliol and Trinity colleges, and as a lecturer for the summer extension programme and the combined college lectures in <i>literae humaniores</i>, Ritchie produced most of his published work during this time.<br>
<br>While at Oxford, Ritchie did not live a cloistered life. He was actively engaged in a variety of reform causes and he rapidly earned a reputation for his progressive political sympathies. An early friend, F. C. Montague, recalled: &#145;He was a zealous democrat, although his mode of thought seemed to have little affinity with that of the common mind. He was a socialist, and had the strongest belief in state action whenever possible&#146;  (Ritchie, 7). In 1879 Arnold Toynbee invited him, along with Alfred Milner and several others, to join a society of &#145;people of radical sympathies&#146; which met to discuss contemporary social issues and to formulate principles for political and social action. Ritchie's attention to reform was also reflected by his activities in the Co-operative Society of Oxford and such other organizations as the Society for the Study of Social Questions, the Social Science Club, the Oxford branch of the Guild of St Matthew, and the ethical societies. Elected to the Fabian Society in 1889, Ritchie addressed meetings on social evolution, natural rights, and the ethics of party politics. He was planning a series of essays to be published under the aegis of the Fabian Society when he broke from the society in November 1893 over indications that the Fabian policy of permeating the Liberal Party might be abandoned in favour of the creation of an independent political party. This, he considered, would play into tory hands, undermine the reforms already secured by the Liberal government, and inaugurate a period of political instability. While he promoted socialist tenets, most notably in his attack on individualism and a minimalist state, Ritchie did not hold to any one socialist programme, and was even uncomfortable with several doctrines advanced by his fellow Fabians.<br>
<br>In 1882 Ritchie married Flora Lindsay, daughter of Colonel A. A. Macdonell of Lochgarry and sister of Arthur Macdonnell, later Boden professor of Sanskrit at Oxford. As secretary of the Oxford women's Liberal association, Flora Macdonnell addressed local meetings on reform issues and campaigned for the crematorium movement. This activity, however, was curtailed by a long illness which troubled her following the birth of twin daughters, only one of whom survived. Flora Ritchie died on 24 July 1888; she was cremated in the Woking crematorium (hers was among the earliest official cremations in the United Kingdom), and her ashes were interred at Holywell cemetery, Oxford. The following year, Ritchie married Ellen Sara Haycraft, a novelist and Fabian, the sister of John Berry Haycraft, professor of physiology at University College, Cardiff; a son, Arthur, was born to them. The independent intellectual and political interests of both Flora Macdonnell and Ellen Haycraft (who lectured for the Fabian Society and who remained an active member after her husband's resignation) contributed in part to Ritchie's strong advocacy of transforming the position of women. A persistent critic of the restrictions circumscribing women's public roles, Ritchie considered a radical reorganization of the national economy to be an indispensable condition for the real, rather than the nominal, advancement of women.<br>
<br>In 1894 Ritchie was appointed to the chair of logic and metaphysics in St Andrews University. In addition to serving as dean of the faculty of arts and as a representative of the senatus at the university court, he delivered a large number of lectures in logic, psychology, metaphysics, and the history of philosophy. Among his students Ritchie was known, and indeed by some idealized, for his inexhaustible patience and his quiet, scholarly lectures, which were characterized by their precision and exactitude. St Andrews had good reason to appreciate his diplomacy in the long-standing dispute about its union with University College, Dundee; he enlivened difficult meetings by writing satiric verse and prose skits on the principal protagonists. In one area only did contemporaries at St Andrews find him wanting: &#145;It is with pain&#146;, observed the university newspaper, &#145;that one has to record that Professor Ritchie is of no use on the golf course, either inside or outside a bunker&#146;  (<span class="italic">College Echoes</span>, 13 Dec 1901). Contemporaries, however, frequently expressed admiration for the breadth and versatility of his knowledge, his charm, and his humour. He appreciated poetry, art, and local history, and from his days as an undergraduate in Edinburgh had a keen interest in botany. His wide circle of friends and colleagues included R. B. Haldane, Alfred Milner, Samuel Alexander, and Gilbert Murray. His significant contributions to the study and teaching of philosophy were recognized in 1898 by the conferral of the honorary degree of LLD by his alma mater.<br>
<br>Ritchie adhered to the idealist school of philosophy which, under the aegis of T. H. Green, Edward Caird, and F. H. Bradley, dominated British philosophical debate from the 1870s to the end of the century [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/98159', "British idealists")</script>]. While he wrote on logic and metaphysics, Ritchie was most interested in developing a political and social philosophy from idealist foundations. It was in his analysis of the application of evolutionary theories to social thought that he struck positions of the most originality and exerted the greatest influence. From the early 1880s he made a close study of Darwin and Lamarck. Dismayed by the <i>laissez-faire</i> conclusions that Herbert Spencer had drawn from evolutionary principles, he argued vigorously in <span class="italic">Darwinism and Politics</span> (1889; 3rd edn, 1895) and in <span class="italic">Principles of State Interference</span> (1891; 4th edn, 1902) that &#145;the theory of natural selection lends no support to the political dogma of laissez faire&#146;; rather, evolutionary science pointed to the need for increased state intervention. He challenged the antithesis between the individual and the state that had been established by nineteenth-century Liberals and which continued to underscore opposition to enlarging the role of the state. Arguing that this antithesis was founded on an aggregative view of individuals, Ritchie affirmed that individuals are indivisible from their membership in a society. In response to Mill, he denied that society was merely a collection of autonomous, self-governing individuals, or that state intervention curtailed individual freedom. Criticizing theorists such as Spencer who defined liberty in a negative sense, Ritchie argued that true individual freedom lies not in distinction and separation from others but in community with them. Echoing the classical legacy that was so formative for Ritchie and for his fellow idealists, he regarded the best life to be formed in community with others.<br>
<br>Breaking down the polarization of the individual and the state led Ritchie, further, to describe the state as a moral entity. &#145;The state has&#146;, he explained, &#145;as its end, the realisation of the best life by the individual&#146;. The state secured the best life of the individual by providing conditions in which the common good was enhanced. Ritchie accordingly defended compulsory education, factory legislation, and numerous other interventions. He consistently favoured &#145;intelligent and scientific state action&#146; above piecemeal philanthropic reforms. Reflecting the Fabian faith in specialist planning, Ritchie held that the laws of social evolution, properly examined, could equip the social reformer to guide society in the direction of progress. Vigorously opposed to intuitionism, with its consequent creed of political Conservatism, Ritchie remained a spirited advocate of uncompromising political reform. He ranged himself alongside progressive Liberals or socialists on most contemporary issues: he supported home rule for Ireland; he considered the South African War to be a just conflict; he advocated sweeping reform of property tenure; and he demonstrated a strong belief in world federation.<br>
<br>A commitment to reform underscored by his view of the organic character of social life prompted Ritchie's authoritative modification of utilitarianism. Much influenced by Green's critique of J. S. Mill, and by his own unique attempt to synthesize Hegel and Darwin, he argued that the moral good is the deliberate adoption of those feelings, acts, and habits which are advantageous, not to the individual, but to the welfare of the community as a whole. By reframing the atomistic basis of utilitarian ethics to incorporate a clearer sense of public interest and a collective good, Ritchie affirmed that idealism and utilitarianism were wholly consistent. This reinterpretation of utilitarianism was characteristic of Ritchie's desire to draw parallels between idealism and other schools of thought. Similarly, in his assiduous study of social evolution, he demonstrated that idealism was not opposed to natural science, as some critics had argued.<br>
<br>Ritchie's study of social organicism moved him to develop a critique of natural rights theory (<span class="italic">Natural Rights</span>, 1895). He objected to the expectation that individuals possess rights independently from their political or social context, and affirmed instead that rights are acquired only by membership in a society, and that they thereby confer the duties of citizenship. While sympathetic with Ritchie's insistence that rights are sensible only in the context of a society, other liberals such as L. T. Hobhouse and J. A. Hobson expressed concern that Ritchie had too sharply minimized the importance of individual rights to a just and democratic society. None the less, Ritchie was a passionate democrat. He condemned the inequity of class difference, noting too the destructiveness of the inequalities between men and women. While other idealists were vulnerable to the charge of demonstrating a na&iuml;ve optimism in social harmony and co-operation, Ritchie had little faith that any innate sense of sympathy or common feeling could overcome the &#145;ceaseless struggle and competition&#146; of the evolutionary process. Persuaded by Darwinian theories of natural selection and the struggle for existence, he was struck by the ubiquity of conflict and competition in and among societies.<br>
<br>Ritchie owed much to Kant and Hegel, and even more to classical philosophy. These influences were mixed with British sources, including Hume, Mill, and Darwin. In <span class="italic">Darwin and Hegel</span> (1893) he explored the parallels between the two thinkers. In his <span class="italic">Philosophical Studies</span> (1905) Ritchie was particularly concerned to resolve confusion between fact and value, and between origin and validity. Avoiding the more recondite style of other idealists, Ritchie's writing was plain, accessible, and polemical. His insistence that evolutionary theory lent no support for <i>laissez-faire</i> but rather was an argument for increased state intervention was followed by progressive political reformers, such as Sidney Webb and the new Liberals. His vision of a moral state, persuasively outlined in accessible articles and speeches, enjoyed a similar impact. Indeed, more than Green, Ritchie has been credited with establishing the basis for the new Liberal defence of an enlarged state. His communitarian interpretation of the relationship between the individual and the state in a just and progressive society also resonates in contemporary communitarian political theory.<br>
<br>Ritchie had never been physically robust. As a young man teaching at Oxford, he often succumbed to the strains of a heavy teaching load; for example, after examining 147 men for Greats in 1886, he was prescribed a voyage to New York to recover. None the less, his death on 3 February 1903 at his home, Kennedy House, St Andrews, following a slight bout of rheumatics, was sudden and unexpected. Heart failure was cited as the immediate cause of death. A religious service was held at the college church on 6 February. After cremation in Glasgow, the ashes were interred at the new cemetery, St Andrews.<br>
