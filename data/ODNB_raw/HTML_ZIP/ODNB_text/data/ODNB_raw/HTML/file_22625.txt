<span class="headword">Pottinger,  Eldred</span>  (1811&#150;1843), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and diplomatist</span>, was born in Ireland on 12 August 1811, the eldest son of Thomas Pottinger of Mount Pottinger, co. Down, and his first wife, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1813), only daughter of James Hamilton Moore. He was educated at Addiscombe College from 1826 to 1827, and entered the Bombay artillery in 1827.<br>
<br>After some regimental service Pottinger was appointed to the political department and became assistant to his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22626/', "Colonel Henry Pottinger")</script>, then resident at Cutch. In 1837 the latter granted his request to travel in Afghanistan. Disguised as a horse dealer, with a few companions he travelled via Peshawar to Kabul and Herat. Soon after his arrival at Herat in September 1837 the city was besieged by a Persian army, which was accompanied by Russian officers. Pottinger then made himself known to Yar Mahammad Khan, the wazir and commander of the forces under Shah Kamran, ruler of Herat, and offered his services for the city's defence. These were accepted, and, largely through Pottinger's energy, a stubborn resistance was organized. At the same time a British-Indian naval demonstration was made in the Persian Gulf, and the siege was ended by the Persians in September 1838. Pottinger's services were highly appreciated, and Lord Auckland, the governor-general, thanked him as one &#145;who, under circumstances of peculiar danger and difficulty, has by his fortitude, ability, and judgment honourably sustained the reputation and interests of his country&#146;  (Pottinger, 62). Though only a subaltern, Pottinger received a brevet majority and was created CB; he was appointed political agent at Herat, but left the city in 1839, being replaced by Major D'Arcy Todd.<br>
<br>In 1841 Pottinger was sent back to Afghanistan as political officer in Kohistan, a district north of Kabul. On 2 November the uprising against the British prot&eacute;g&eacute; Shah Shuja and the British broke out at Kabul. The same day insurgents attacked Pottinger's residence at Laghman, and he fled to Charikar, the neighbouring town, which was occupied by the 4th Gurkhas, part of Shah Shuja's force and commanded by Christopher Codrington. There they were besieged. Codrington was killed on 6 November and succeeded by John Colpoys Haughton; Pottinger was wounded in the leg. On the 14th the Gurkhas evacuated the town, and despite great difficulties Pottinger and Haughton, both severely wounded, escaped to Kabul, arriving on the 15th. There, on 23 December 1841, the British envoy Sir William Macnaghten was murdered by Akbar Khan, and Pottinger succeeded to Macnaghten's dangerous post. Supplies were short and demoralization was widespread; the British-Indian garrison, under General Elphinstone, was helplessly inactive, and against his better judgement and advice Pottinger negotiated the British-Indian withdrawal from Kabul. On 6 January 1842 the retreat began towards Jalalabad, but Akbar detained Pottinger as one of three hostages. He thus escaped the massacre in which the retreating army was destroyed. He was kept prisoner at Kabul until Major-General Pollock's army arrived there on 17 September 1842, and returned with it to India in October. His services received scant recognition from the new governor-general, Lord Ellenborough, who was hostile to those involved in the Afghanistan disaster. However, the court of inquiry exonerated Pottinger and praised his character and conduct.<br>
<br>With no worthwhile employment in sight Pottinger visited his uncle Sir Henry Pottinger at Hong Kong. There he died, after a brief illness, on 15 November 1843. He was buried at Hong Kong. Sir Henry Lawrence wrote of him:<blockquote>India, fertile in heroes, has shown since the days of Clive, <i>no man of greater and earlier promise</i> than Eldred Pottinger. Yet, hero as he was, you might have sat for weeks beside him at table and not have discovered that he had seen a shot fired. (Macrory, 270)</blockquote>
