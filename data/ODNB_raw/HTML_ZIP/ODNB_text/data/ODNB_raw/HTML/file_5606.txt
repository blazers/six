<span class="headword">Clements,  Michael</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1735, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1797), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, is of unknown origins. Between 1748 and 1749 he served in the <i>Syren</i> in the East Indies. His lieutenant's passing certificate  (TNA: PRO, ADM 107/4, p. 334) gives his age in December 1755 as &#145;twenty and upwards&#146;. In May 1757 he was first lieutenant of the frigate <i>Unicorn</i> when she engaged and captured the <i>Invincible</i>, a large Malouin privateer. Captain Thomas Graves of the <i>Unicorn</i> was killed, and Clements, after conducting the fight to a successful issue, brought the prize into Kinsale and went out again in pursuit of the privateer's consort, which he also captured and brought in. For this good service Clements was immediately promoted to the command of the buss <i>London</i>, and four months later (29 September) to post rank and the command of the frigate <i>Actaeon</i>. Clements continued in her, attached to the Channel Fleet, until June 1759, when he was moved into the <i>Pallas</i> (36 guns), also with the fleet blockading Brest and Quiberon Bay, and specially employed, with the other frigates, in cruising against the enemy's privateers and in communicating with the home ports. By a fortunate accident, the <i>Pallas</i>, in company with the <i>Aeolus</i> and <i>Brilliant</i>, put into Kinsale in the last days of February 1760, just as a message came from the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant of Ireland, that Thurot's squadron was at Belfast. They immediately put to sea again, and, coming off Belfast on the morning of 28 February, succeeded in capturing all Thurot's ships with little loss. The <i>Pallas</i> continued on the same service until the end of the year, and was then sent to the Mediterranean, where she remained until after the peace, and returned to England in December 1763.<br>
<br>On paying off this ship Clements refused to give a certificate to the master, whom he reported as &#145;inattentive to his duty&#146;. The master in revenge laid an accusation of waste and malversation of stores against his captain. After an inquiry at the Navy Office the charge was, in November 1765, pronounced groundless and malicious. In 1769 he commanded the <i>Dorsetshire</i> (70 guns) guardship at Portsmouth, which in 1770 was sent to the Mediterranean as part of the British fleet watching the French at Toulon. In March 1778 he was appointed to the <i>Vengeance</i> (74 guns), which he commanded in the action off Ushant on 27 July and in the October cruise under Admiral Augustus Keppel. He was afterwards a witness for the defence in the admiral's trial, and spoke very strongly in the admiral's favour. A few months later he was compelled to resign his command owing to poor health, and he never received another. In July 1780 he applied for leave to go abroad with his family, his residence (since at least 1767) having been Weybridge, Surrey. Clements chose Tuscany and finally asked for a passport for himself, his wife, and daughter for Ostend. &#145;When my health shall be re-established&#146;, he added, &#145;I shall be happy to return and follow my profession with every zeal to regain that reputation which at present appears to me so much sullied.&#146; His name continued on the list of captains until 1787, when there was a very large retirement. Then, or a year or two later, he was made a rear-admiral on the superannuated list; he is believed to have died about 1797.<br>
