<span class="headword">Egerton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grey]</span>,  Bridget</span>, Lady Egerton  (<em>d.</em> 1648), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was the only surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11524/', "Arthur Grey, fourteenth Baron Grey of Wilton (1536&#150;1593)")</script>, and his second wife, Jane Sibylla (1552&#150;1615), daughter of Sir Richard Morison and widow of Edward Russell, Baron Russell (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1572); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11562/', "Thomas Grey, fifteenth Baron Grey of Wilton (1575&#150;1614)")</script>, was her eldest brother. Her youth was presumably overshadowed by the financial troubles of her father, who died deeply indebted in 1593, and by the conviction of her unstable brother for treason in 1603; later Bridget described herself as &#145;the last remnant of that auncient house, that hath tasted miserie and affliction enoughe&#146;  (Bridget Egerton to duke of Buckingham, 28 Oct 1616, BL, Add. MS 37069, fol. 202). But her family was also renowned for its enthusiastic protestantism, a tradition she seemed to uphold as inheritor of the advowson of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, in her petition of 1616 to secure the living for the son of her father's incumbent, the erstwhile nonconformist Thomas Sparke. In 1609 (marriage settlement December) she married Rowland Egerton (<i>d</i>. 1646), eldest surviving son of Sir John Egerton of Egerton and Oulton, Cheshire, knight, and Margaret, daughter of Sir Rowland Stanley. Their eldest son, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1614/15, <i>d</i>. in or before 1646), was born in Buckinghamshire; they had five other sons&#151;John (<i>bur</i>. 1674), Arthur, Rowland, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40799/', "Sir Philip Egerton (d. 1698)")</script>, and Charles&#151;and three daughters&#151;Sibylla or Sybill, Elizabeth, and Mary. Following the death of Thomas Grey in the Tower in July 1614 without male heirs, his barony fell into abeyance between Bridget Egerton and her older half-sister, Elizabeth Goodwin. Bridget's husband was knighted at Whitehall in March 1617 and acquired a baronetcy three weeks later. After his father's death in 1623 or 1624, he established himself on family estates at Farthinghoe, Northamptonshire, although he sat in the 1624 and 1625 parliaments as MP for Wotton Bassett, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>In 1872 one of Lady Egerton's descendants published &#145;A forme of confession grounded upon the ancient catholique and apostolic faith&#146;, which survived among family papers as a small, neatly written notebook, bearing her name and dated 1636. Its nineteen articles of belief display confident protestant faith and a capacity for sophisticated understanding and lucid, trenchant argument, extending beyond simple amplification of the texts of the apostles or the Nicene creed; they are heavily allusive both to the <span class="roman">Old</span> and the <span class="roman">New</span> testaments. God is a spiritual essence, the first of the &#145;coequall, coessentiall and consubstantiall&#146; Trinity  (&#145;A forme of confession&#146;, 10). An account of the fall of man and original sin is followed by an assertion of predestination, sustained in frequent subsequent references to the elect, although there is no reference to the fate of the reprobate or unbelievers. Salvation is by faith alone; works are its fruit, by God's command, by Christ's purchase, by love and charity, and make &#145;our calling, and election certain to our selves&#146;  (p. 20). Jesus, priest, prophet, and king, is the only mediator, advocate and intercessor; the papists' &#145;fiction&#146;  (p. 18) of purgatory is rejected. The canonical scriptures contain everything necessary to salvation: &#145;I see no neede, nor place left, for the popish trash, of unwritten verities&#146;  (p. 20). &#145;The supremacie of the Sea of Rome &hellip; is a Satanicall forgery&#146; and in practice &#145;any particular church may erre&#146;  (p. 23); a true church is known by its preaching of the Word of God, by its sacraments &#145;sincerely ministered&#146;  (p. 24), and (less essentially) by its execution of scriptural discipline. The two sacraments are important, but are &#145;externall signes&#146;  (p. 25): the significance of baptism is specifically linked to the washing of &#145;such as are within the covenant&#146;  (p. 26); the Lord's supper is spiritual nourishment, the &#145;popish dreame&#146; of transubstantiation &#145;utterly&#146; rejected  (p. 27). The author ends with the assertion that &#145;This is my faith, this is my hope and trust ye which I have learned and been taught out of the word of God&#146;  (p. 30).<br>
<br>Lady Egerton has been described as &#145;an ardent Puritan&#146;  (Hampson, 255) but, as with many contemporary gentry, her ascription to a particular place in the spectrum of opinion within the Church of England is not straightforward. Sir Rowland's taking of his churchwardens to the court of high commission in 1639 in a dispute over church seating does not seem to indicate someone reluctant to use the instruments of Laudianism, although he may have regretted it when costs were awarded against him in November 1639. He was prominent as a royalist before his death on 3 October 1646, and was listed in 1648 as having lent the king &pound;1080 on the Oxford engagement, but he gave some service to parliament, and the rector whom he presented to Farthinghoe in 1638, Walter Jackman, lived an apparently quiet life through the 1640s and 1650s. On the other hand, the &#145;Mr Diggle&#146; named as household chaplain in Lady Egerton's will, drawn up on 1 January 1648, was almost certainly Edmund Diggle of Magdalen College, Oxford: he had preached before the Oxford parliament, refused a DD after the fall of the city in 1646, and was ejected from his fellowship later in 1648; after the Restoration, as chaplain to Bishop Accepted Frewen, he may be associated with the more ceremonial wing of the church.<br>
<br>Lady Egerton's personal faith remained constant: her will conveyed assurance of salvation and contemplated her soul's &#145;ascent to the Heavenly Jerusalem&#146;, longing &#145;as the hart panteth after the waterbrookes &hellip; [to] bee with the liveinge God&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/206, ref. 128). Desiring to be buried near her deceased eldest son, Thomas, she left small bequests to her daughter Elizabeth, wife of Sir William Radcliffe of Lancashire, her sons Philip, Rowland, and Charles, and her servants. The overseers were Edward Bagshawe of Moreton Pinckney, Northamptonshire, and John Griffith of Bloxham, Oxfordshire, while the residue of the estate was to go to her executrix, her daughter Sybill, widow of Edward Bellot of The Ashes, Staffordshire. Lady Egerton died that summer, and was buried at Farthinghoe on 28 July. The will was proved in November by her daughter, by that time married to Sir Edmund Anderson.<br>
