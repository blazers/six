<span class="headword">Ross,  Donald James</span>  (1872&#150;1948), <span class="occ">golf course architect</span>, was born on 23 November 1872 in Dornoch, Sutherland, the son of Murdo Ross, a stonemason, and his wife, Lilly Campbell. As a teenager he was apprenticed to a local carpenter, Peter Murray, but was persuaded by John Sutherland, secretary of Royal Dornoch Golf Club, to move to St Andrews and learn the club making trade in Robert Forgan's workshop, close by the old course. Clearly Sutherland had seen something in the young man's golfing abilities and in 1893, after two years in the Fife capital, he brought Ross back to be club professional and greenkeeper at Dornoch with his younger brother Alec as assistant.<br>
<br>Four years later Ross moved again, this time across the Atlantic. He had given some lessons, played a few rounds, and talked golf with an American visitor, Robert Wheeler Willson, professor of astronomy at Harvard University. Like Sutherland, he was impressed with Ross and he convinced the young professional to migrate to the United States, where a golf boom was providing job opportunities for many emigrant Scots. Thus in 1898 Ross took up a position, arranged for him by Wilson, at the Oakley golf club at Watertown in suburban Boston. Here he made the acquaintance of James Tufts, whose family had made its money in the soft drinks industry. Tufts's health was such that he wintered in the warmer climate of North Carolina, where his entrepreneurial spirit led to his buying some 5000 acres of land at Pinehurst which he intended to turn into a winter resort with a golf course as part of the plans.<br>
<br>Tufts offered Ross the position of winter professional at Pinehurst, a job that he took up in 1900. In 1904 he married Janet Conchie of Ayr, Scotland, with whom he had a daughter, Lillian. Course design soon replaced playing as Ross's major activity, although he still managed to finish in the top ten in the United States open championship on four occasions (his brother, Alec, who had followed him to the USA, won the US open in 1907), and returned to St Andrews to play in the open championship of 1910, when he finished eighth. For a dozen years Ross concentrated on improving the existing course at Pinehurst, but in 1912 he began work on the prosaically named Pinehurst no. 2, which, after it opened in 1925, was acclaimed as one of the finest courses of any era. Ross adapted his vision of Scottish links terrain to an American situation of pine forests, scrubland, and quick-draining sandy soil. Initially, until suitable strains were developed, he made the greens of sand, but they remained full of challenging subtleties, and were reminiscent of Dornoch in that they repelled anything less than a good shot. He eschewed water as a hazard, believing that the impossibility of making a recovery shot was too punitive. He believed in strategic rather than penal course design. His course architecture had two basic tenets: first, there should always be more than one way of playing a given hole, so that the audacious player should be properly rewarded for his daring, with the less skilled finding an alternative route home; second, that his courses should test every facet of the game&#151;long and accurate tee shots, controlled iron play, precision around the green, and consistency upon it. Mastery of only one of these skills would never be enough to tame a Ross course.<br>
<br>The success of the Pinehurst resort, which eventually boasted seven courses, all designed by Ross, led to his being in great demand, and he became at least peripherally involved in designing and constructing hundreds of courses (about 415 courses in the USA, Canada, and Cuba have been credited to him). With summer offices in Rhode Island and branches in Chicago, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, by 1925 Ross and his &#145;associates&#146; employed up to 3000 people on architectural projects across America. When fully engaged, he produced truly outstanding designs. In the eight US open championships staged between 1919 and 1926, no fewer than six Ross courses were chosen as the venue: Brae Burn, Inverness, Skokie, Oakland Hills, Worcester, and Scioto. Yet his two greatest creations remain Pinehurst no. 2, which did not stage its first US open until 1999, and Seminole in North Palm Beach, Florida, which has never done so. The latter was one of the few courses for which Ross actively sought the design contract. Another legendary Scottish figure in the story of American golf, Tommy Armour, maintained that &#145;the man who doesn't feel emotionally stirred when he golfs at Pinehurst &hellip; should be ruled out of golf for life&#146;  (Green, 195).<br>
<br>Apart from making a few suggestions for his native Dornoch course, Ross did no work outside North America. He remained at Pinehurst for the rest of his life, and finally became golf director of the Tufts enterprise. He was elected honorary president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects when it was formed in 1946; the society continues to present the annual Donald Ross award to an individual who has made a significant contribution to golf in general and golf course architecture specifically. In 1989 the Donald Ross Society was formed for the restoration and preservation of courses designed by him. Unlike his contemporary course designers, Ross did not publish much, but a collection of his observations on golf and course design, originally intended to have been published in 1914, came to light posthumously, and was published in 1996 as <span class="italic">Golf Has Never Failed Me: the Lost Commentaries of Legendary Golf Architect Donald J. Ross</span>. His first wife died in 1922 and in 1924 he married a widow, Florence Blackington of Pinehurst; there were no children of this marriage.<br>
<br>Ross died of a heart attack at Pinehurst, North Carolina, on 26 April 1948 and was interred at Newton, Massachusetts, next to Janet Conchie.<br>
