<span class="headword">Stanley,  Edward Montagu Cavendish</span>, Lord Stanley  (1894&#150;1938), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 9 July 1894 at 36 Great Cumberland Place, Marylebone, London, the elder son and second of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36243/', "Edward George Villiers Stanley, later seventeenth earl of Derby (1865&#150;1948)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Alice Maud Olivia Montagu (1862&#150;1957). He inherited his courtesy title in 1908.<br>
<br>After Eton College, Lord Stanley was sent to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1912, as a companion for the prince of Wales, though their friendship did not flourish until they became captains in the Grenadier Guards in 1914. Stanley received two wounds and the Military Cross. He was aide-de-camp to Horace Smith-Dorrien (1914) and adjutant of the Household battalion (1916&#150;17).<br>
<br>In 1917 Archibald Salvidge, the tory party &#145;boss&#146; of Liverpool, persuaded Stanley to stand for parliament in Abercromby. The prestige of the family name was meant to guarantee his unopposed return, but a one-legged ex-private from the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers came forward to protest at the <span class="roman">Review of Exemptions Act</span> of 1917, which enforced medical re-examination of all discharged servicemen. Lord Derby, Stanley's father, was then war secretary. The contest attracted much publicity, but Stanley convincingly won the by-election of 28 June 1917 without making a single appearance. On 17 July 1917 he married the Hon. Sibyl Louise Beatrix Cadogan (1893&#150;1969), maid of honour to Queen Mary and always known as Portia. She had been expected to marry the prince of Wales, with whom Stanley was posted to the general headquarters of the British forces in Italy (1917&#150;18).<br>
<br>Despite taking his seat as its youngest member, Stanley had still not spoken in the House of Commons when the Abercromby constituency disappeared in the 1918 redistribution. He was then MP (1922&#150;38) for the Fylde, a rural area of north Lancashire, where Lord Derby owned 10,000 acres and the poll was uncontested as often as not. When he enlivened his speeches with racing tips, locals hailed a chip off the old block. He did very closely resemble his father: tall and well-built, with a thick moustache. The two worked together happily in the management of their stud farm and numerous estates. The heir emulated the earl in county life too, as vice-lieutenant of Lancashire from 1932. Gentle and genial were adjectives applied to Eddie Stanley, whose politics seemed devoid of partisan bitterness. Fashionable London society found him good fun; some casual acquaintances thought his manner oddly reserved&#151;for the public was never told that he was hard of hearing.<br>
<br>Stanley helped Derby, again at the War Office, as parliamentary private secretary (1922&#150;4) before becoming a junior lord of the Treasury (1924&#150;7). As a whip, he spoke in the chamber extremely seldom. Derby gave him Holwood House, Keston, Kent&#151;one of many transfers of property&#151;and Eddie had three sons himself by 1926. From November 1927 until July 1929 he was deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. Following the reform of Conservative central office in December 1927, selection of candidates and agents fell within his purview, and his other special concern was the Junior Imperial League, which he chaired until 1933. A smart aristocrat of the war generation hit the right note with the &#145;Imps&#146; (tories under thirty). Relations with the party chairman were more tense. J. C. C. Davidson accused him of undervaluing the Women's Unionist Organization and usurping the title of co-chairman. Eddie was not quite all amiable simplicity. He carried the burden of tradition: a Lord Stanley who never reached the cabinet would be a discredit to the family. Everyone said that his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36249/', "Oliver Stanley MP")</script>, was the clever one.<br>
<br>Stanley tentatively launched himself in the Commons after 1929. His favourite topics were support for agriculture and the need for more empire-grown cotton to supply the Lancashire mills. As parliamentary and financial secretary to the Admiralty from 10 November 1931, he assisted Sir Bolton Eyres-Monsell with matters of pay and personnel. He presided over the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations in 1932, accompanied Anthony Eden to the world disarmament conference in 1933, and was sworn of the privy council in 1934. After a brief interlude as parliamentary under-secretary for the dominions (18 June&#150;28 November 1935), the Admiralty welcomed him back when Eyres-Monsell went to the Lords. During the Italo-Ethiopian war, it was Stanley who announced a 35 per cent increase in the naval estimates, signalling the start of rearmament. He also led the British delegation to the Montreux conference which abolished international control of the Dardanelles in July 1936. Thereafter, with Sir Samuel Hoare as first lord, Stanley reverted to his usual low profile. He was promoted on 28 May 1937 to parliamentary under-secretary of state for India and Burma (under Zetland, a peer), but septic rheumatism and an abdominal operation laid him low for much of the year.<br>
<br>Many were surprised when Neville Chamberlain selected Stanley as dominions secretary on 16 May 1938. He had always been faithful to the National Government, but political insiders wondered how his hearing would cope with discussion in the cabinet room. The first challenge was to deal with Robert Menzies, prime minister of Australia, who came to Britain demanding revision of the UK&#150;Australia trade agreement (1932). A tactful rebuff sufficed. The South African government received like treatment when it pressed for a role in the administration of Swaziland, Bechuanaland, and Basutoland. In August 1938, Stanley went to open the Canadian national exhibition in Toronto. He had a bad limp after twisting his left leg while playing golf; when he returned on 25 September he was gravely ill. Having attended only eleven cabinet meetings&#151;the last on 28 July&#151;he took no part in policy making during the Sudeten crisis.<br>
<br>Lord Stanley died at the age of forty-four on 16 October 1938 at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, Marylebone, London. The cause of death was lymphosarcoma: a small crack in the femur had released cancerous bone marrow cells into his bloodstream. On 20 October he was buried in St Mary's churchyard, Knowsley, Lancashire. Stanley may not have carried much political weight except as his father's son, but he did achieve his ambition.<br>
