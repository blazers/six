</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray, Sir  Archibald James</span>  (1860&#150;1945), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 21 April 1860 at Woodhouse, near Kingsclere, Hampshire, the third child of Charles Murray, landed proprietor, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Captain John Baker Graves, of the 19th regiment, and later judge at Kurunegala, Ceylon. Educated at Cheltenham College, Murray entered the army through the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1879 was gazetted to the 27th regiment which, two years later, became the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. His early service was abroad, at Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Cape, where in 1888, as a captain, he took part in the suppression of a Zulu rising. In 1890 he married Caroline Helen (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Baker Sweet of Hillersdon, Tiverton. They had a son.<br>
<br>In 1897 Murray gained entrance to the Staff College, Camberley; among his fellow students were the future field marshals W. R. Robertson, D. Haig, and E. H. H. Allenby. Thoughtful and reserved in manner, Murray seemed old for his years, and was generally spoken of at the college as &#145;Old Archie&#146;.<br>
<br>At the end of the two-year course Murray rejoined his battalion, but on the outbreak of the South African War he was appointed intelligence officer on the staff of Sir William Penn Symons, commanding in Natal, and was with him when he was mortally wounded, and his senior staff officer killed, in the opening frontier fight at Talana. The next-in-command was ill, and Murray, appointed chief of staff by him, managed skilfully to extricate the British force from its advanced position and bring it back to Ladysmith. His reputation as a field soldier was deservedly high and he was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1900. Henceforward generals competed for his services. He was on the staff of Sir George White during the siege of Ladysmith; and during 1900 was senior staff officer to Sir Archibald Hunter of the 10th division. In October 1901 Murray was promoted to command the 2nd battalion of his regiment in India, soon to be warned for service in South Africa, where it arrived in February 1902. In leading his men in an attack in the northern Transvaal, for which he was appointed to the DSO, he was dangerously wounded in the abdomen.<br>
<br>Between the South African War and the First World War Murray held a series of important staff appointments: senior general staff officer of the 1st division (Aldershot); director of military training, general staff, at the War Office, 1907&#150;12 (Haig being one of the other two directors); and inspector of infantry (1912&#150;14). He was promoted major-general in 1910, the year in which his first wife died. In 1912 Murray married Mildred Georgina, daughter of his former Colonel, William Toke Dooner, of Maidstone.<br>
<br>Murray had held the command of the 2nd division for six months when war was declared in 1914, but he was appointed chief of the general staff of the British expeditionary force (BEF) at the express wish of Sir John French, under whose command he was serving at Aldershot. The early days of the campaign&#151;the battles of Mons and Le Cateau, the retreat on Paris, the advance to the Marne and the Aisne, the transfer of the BEF to Flanders, and the first battle of Ypres&#151;were more than strenuous, and according to French's reminiscences, <span class="italic">1914</span>, at the end of the year Murray had fallen sick. He was obliged in January 1915 to go to England for rest, and Robertson (who was then quartermaster-general) took his place. In February 1915 Lord Kitchener appointed Murray deputy chief of the Imperial General Staff for the special purpose of superintending the training of the New Army, and in September he was promoted chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). In December, however, French resigned and was replaced by Haig, and Robertson became CIGS.<br>
<br>Murray was appointed to a command in Egypt, where he arrived in January 1916, with instructions to secure the safety of the Suez Canal, administer martial law in Egypt, and reorganize the troops evacuated from Gallipoli. That his forces were to be regarded as the &#145;imperial strategic reserve&#146; made the task Murray confronted in Egypt all the more challenging and he was widely considered an excellent choice for the job. He tackled his large and complex workload with determination and enthusiasm.<br>
<br>In August, after an invading enemy force had been defeated at Romani (20 miles from the canal) it was decided that the Egyptian expeditionary force (EEF) would advance across the Sinai peninsula. By December, in spite of opposition and physical difficulties, this had been successfully achieved with the laying of a railway line and a 12 inch water main across the desert. As Allenby would note in his dispatches: &#145;Murray's brilliant campaign in Sinai had removed the danger to Egypt, and had forced the enemy back across his own frontier&#146;. Early in 1917 Murray was instructed to advance into Palestine. Frustration with the attritional war on the western front, combined with religious attachments to the land of Palestine, led Prime Minister Lloyd George to urge for an ambitious offensive in the east. On 26 March an attempt was made to capture Gaza: though the objectives were initially secured, poor communications in the command structure resulted in troops being pulled out at the last minute. Murray none the less sent home a positive report of the battle and was then directed to renew operations and occupy Jerusalem. Although Murray protested that the operations required more forces than were at his disposal, he obeyed his instructions and attacked Gaza again. However, the Turkish troops fought notoriously well on the defensive and inflicted upon Murray a serious defeat, the scale of which had an immediate effect on the troops.<br>
<br>A change in command was deemed necessary and Murray was superseded by Allenby, who took over on 29 June. With additional forces the EEF under Allenby's command made dramatic advances in the autumn of 1917 (including the highly publicized capture of Jerusalem in December). While the view that Murray's departure marked a new beginning for the EEF gained wide currency in the light of Allenby's significant achievements, Murray's preparations for the Palestine campaign are also widely acknowledged. Allenby himself, in his final dispatch, noted his indebtedness to his predecessor &#145;who, by his bridging of the desert between Egypt and Palestine, laid the foundations for the subsequent advances of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force&#146;. Murray by his foresight and strategic imagination &#145;brought the waters of the Nile to the borders of Palestine, planned the skilful military operations by which the Turks were driven from strong positions in the desert over the frontier of Egypt, stood all tests and formed the cornerstone of my success&#146;.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Murray became general officer commanding at Aldershot in August 1919. In 1920 he published the full text of his dispatches. He retired from the army in 1922 and died at his home, Makepeace, Park Lane, Reigate, on 23 January 1945. He was appointed KC (1911), KCMG (1915), GCMG (1917), and GCB (1928). Murray was a grand officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and a member of a number of other European orders.<br>
