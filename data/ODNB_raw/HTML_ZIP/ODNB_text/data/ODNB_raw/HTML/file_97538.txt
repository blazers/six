<span class="headword">McDonald,  (William) Ian</span>  (1933&#150;2006), <span class="occ">neurologist</span>, was born on 15 March 1933 at Ngaio Road, Wellington, New Zealand, the son of William Allan Chapple McDonald, insurance manager, and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leithead. Both parents had been born in New Zealand. McDonald and his sister, Leithe, younger by three years, grew up in Christchurch, where he was educated at St Andrew's College, subsequently matriculating at Knox College, Otago, in 1951 and graduating in medicine in 1957. He worked first as a research officer of the New Zealand Medical Research Council with Archie Macintyre, obtaining the degree of PhD with a thesis on &#145;The effects of experimental demyelination on conduction in peripheral nerve: a histological and electrophysiological study&#146; (1962), having already written a dissertation on &#145;Ascending long spinal reflexes&#146; (1955); he then worked as lecturer in medicine at Otago. But academic life in New Zealand, and occasional work as a jackaroo fixing fences on his father's property, had its limitations; in 1963 McDonald moved to London, where his aesthetic interests were cultivated and his personality was more easily expressed.<br>
<br>Although the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Queen Square, was an intimidating place to work in the 1960s, McDonald's talents were quickly recognized there, and he was appointed proleptically to the consultant staff in 1966 before working for three years in Boston, USA, with another New Zealander, Derek Denny-Brown, to whom the brightest neurologists training at Queen Square were usually sent at that time to broaden their experience of experimental neurology. The remainder of McDonald's career was spent at Queen Square, as consultant neurologist and consultant physician at Moorfields Eye Hospital from 1969 and as professor of neurology in the University of London from 1974. He rapidly honed the traits that characterized his professional style; sought after for his clinical opinions and renowned for his expertise and knowledge of multiple sclerosis and neuro-ophthalmology, he trained by example, lifting less gifted colleagues, and reflecting with generosity and uncomplicated pride on their achievements. Apparently easy performance, in his lectures and in writing, concealed meticulous preparation and attention to detail. McDonald was adept at synthesizing a complex story, with perspective and modesty concerning his own achievements set in the context of the illustrious predecessors he so much admired.<br>
<br>In the 1960s McDonald was one of very few neurologists active in laboratory work who transferred the rigorous discipline of descriptive clinical neurology into the modern era of mechanistic studies. Working at that time with Tom Sears, he characterized the physiology and morphology of demyelination and remyelination in the central nervous system, work that leaned on classical studies and anticipated the era of limiting and repairing the damage in multiple sclerosis. In the 1970s, with Martin Halliday, he pioneered laboratory methods for supplementing the clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The observations brought objectivity to the diagnostic process, and the techniques became the definitive markers of what happens physiologically when the myelin sheath is lost from nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord. In the 1980s McDonald realized that magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy could be used to illuminate the nature of inflammatory brain disease; his work provided laboratory measures for charting the efficacy of the first wave of disease-modifying treatments introduced in the mid-1990s.<br>
<br>McDonald understood better than others the contribution made to the evolution of modern neurology in the UK by his mentor Roger Gilliatt, foundation professor of neurology in the University of London and chairman of the department at Queen Square from 1962, whom he expected to succeed in 1987. But it was not until 1995, following David Marsden and Anita Harding, that McDonald was appointed, and then for only a short period before his own retirement in 1998. He edited <span class="italic">Brain</span> from 1991 to 1997, having earlier brokered the financially successful move of that journal, established in 1878, from Macmillan to Oxford University Press, achieving financial security in the process and thereby allowing the guarantors subsequently to distribute significant resources in support of young people training in the neurosciences. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1972, of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in 1989, and of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1999. He co-founded the European Neurological Society and served as its president in 1994&#150;5; he also served as president of the Association of British Neurologists (1994&#150;5) and the World Congress of Neurology (2001). Among many international prizes was the Charcot award of the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies (1991); and, being in love with the city, he was particularly pleased to be elected a foreign member of the Venetian Institute of Science, Arts, and Letters.<br>
<br>In retirement, McDonald served as Harveian librarian at the Royal College of Physicians of London, editing Munk's <span class="italic">Roll</span>, seeing through to publication the final volume of the <span class="italic">History of the Royal College of Physicians of London</span> (by Asa Briggs, 2005), and with others editing an illustrated history of <span class="italic">The Royal College of Physicians and its Collections</span> (2001). When the sale of important items such as the Wilton psalter was mooted, he was a staunch defender of the responsibility that the college had to preserve the legacies of those fellows who had built up the collection. The item that gave him most pleasure&#151;for professional and historical reasons&#151;was the manuscript diary of Augustus d'Este, grandson of George III, who first wrote a personal account of multiple sclerosis.<br>
<br>McDonald's partner from the early 1980s was Stanley Joseph Hamilton (1951&#150;2011), with whom he entered into a civil partnership in 2006. They had many friends among people active in music, dance, the visual arts, literature, and history; and these friendships outside medicine provided a counterpoint to McDonald's professional work and a rich source of information and anecdote that he used in conversation, and in his writings and lectures. His passion was music. He considered himself to be of average competence as a pianist, being a useful accompanist in lieder and chamber music from the baroque classical and easier Romantic repertories; but others judged that, as a member of a trio, he was exceptional&#151;certain in rhythm, intensely musical in his ability to see a long phrase within a theme, and with the fingers led by the ear. It was poignant that a small stroke in 2004 removed, for a while, his ability to understand music, read a score, or play the piano. Later he published, in <span class="italic">Brain</span>, a characteristically erudite account of this intensely personal episode. He died suddenly of a heart attack at home, 15 St Peter's Street, Islington, London, on 13 December 2006. He was survived by his civil partner, Stanley Hamilton.<br>
