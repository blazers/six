<span class="headword">Skelton,  Philip</span>  (1707&#150;1787), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in February 1707 in Derriaghy, co. Antrim, the son of Richard Skelton (<i>d</i>. 1718), a farmer who had served an apprenticeship as a gunsmith, and also traded as a tanner. His mother, Arabella Cathcart, was the daughter of a farmer, and the tenancy of the farm at Derriaghy, held under Lord Conway, was her dowry. His paternal grandfather had settled in Ireland during the reign of Charles I. Philip had five brothers, two of whom also became clergymen, and four sisters. He was sent at the age of ten to a Latin school at Lisburn, conducted by a Revd Mr Clarke. He was prompted to be studious there by the suggestion of his father that his alternative to going to university was to be employed as a labourer. His father's death in 1718 curtailed the family's relatively comfortable lifestyle, but Philip continued at Clarke's school. In June 1724 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a sizar. Dr Patrick Delany was his tutor, and the two men struck up a lasting friendship. He was elected a scholar in 1726, and graduated BA in July 1728, despite allegations that he was a Jacobite.<br>
<br>After teaching in the endowed school at Dundalk, Skelton was nominated curate to the physician Samuel Madden at Drummully, co. Fermanagh, and ordained deacon by Bishop Sterne of Clogher in 1729. He lived with Madden for two years as private tutor to his sons, as well as attending to his curacy. It was here that Skelton produced the first in a long line of published pamphlets, a short work in support of Madden's scheme for premiums in Trinity College. He also began a lifelong habit of donating part of his salary to the poor. In 1732 he became a curate at Monaghan, where the rector paid him &pound;40 a year, most of which was spent for the benefit of his family or poor parishioners, and in clearing his still outstanding college debts. He attended assiduously to his clerical duties, paying particular attention to the children of the parish. He also performed many specific acts of kindness and Christian endeavour, including securing a pardon for a condemned felon, and using his substantial physique to impress his values on errant spirits. Additionally he studied medicine, and dispensed medical help within the parish.<br>
<br>Skelton found time to publish anonymously a series of short discourses against Socinianism, and in 1736 two ironical pamphlets in support of the established church that purported to be a defence of deism and dissent but were couched in such terms as to appear ridiculous. The following year, again anonymously, he addressed the inadequacies of the Irish legal system in a <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Constitution and Effects of a Petty Jury</span>, while in 1741, inspired by what he witnessed during a period of famine, he produced <span class="italic">The Necessity of Tillage and Granaries in a Letter to a Member of Parliament</span>. The latter called for the extension of tillage farming and the erection of public granaries to alleviate future distress. Both works were well received in Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1742 Skelton became for a short time tutor to the politician James Caulfeild, first earl of Charlemont. A quarrel with Lord Charlemont's stepfather led to his returning to his curacy in Monaghan, though Skelton dedicated <span class="italic">Truth in a Mask</span> (1744), a series of parables, to Charlemont. In 1744 he published <span class="italic">The Candid Reader</span>, a satirical treatment of a number of well-known contemporary figures, including Samuel Johnson. In the same year he issued <span class="italic">A Letter to the Authors of the &#145;Divine Analogy&#146; and the &#145;Minute Philosopher&#146;</span>, another paper in support of the doctrines of the established church. In 1745 he produced <span class="italic">The Chevalier's Hopes</span>, a hastily written pamphlet condemning the Pretender, James Stuart.<br>
<br>Skelton travelled to London in 1748 to publish <span class="italic">Ophimaches, or, Deism Revealed</span>, which he considered too important a text to publish in Dublin. It consisted of eight conversations designed to repudiate the teachings of deists such as John Toland, and bolster again the conventions of reformed Christianity. He received &pound;200 for the manuscript, and was treated in the city as a minor celebrity. He also took the opportunity to preach in several London churches. A second edition appeared in 1751. Though generously commended by Bishop Thomas Sherlock, like most of Skelton's work it lacked a coherent structure, and was largely impenetrable to the ill-informed. His prose was, and remained, excessively rhetorical, and unnecessarily elaborate.<br>
<br>In 1750 Skelton was given the living of Templecarn, a large parish in the counties of Donegal and Fermanagh. It included St Patrick's Purgatory, then the primary centre of Catholic pilgrimage in Ireland, of which he later wrote a detailed account. The parish was in a somewhat neglected condition. The state of religious knowledge and observance was poor among the protestant community; there was no rectory, and the parish yielded less than &pound;200 a year. Despite this situation, and Skelton's personal dislike for the area, he continued his ministry and good works, as he had in Monaghan. He preached specifically against whiskey drinking, and also continued writing. In 1751 he published <span class="italic">The Dignity of the Christian Ministry: a Sermon</span>, which addressed the differences between dignity conferred by worldly wealth, and that inherent in the Christian ministry. This was followed in 1753 by <span class="italic">Consultation, or, A Dialogue of the Gods</span>, an attack on the Arians. He again visited London in 1754, and published <span class="italic">Discourses Controversial and Practical on Various Subjects</span>, a collection of his sermons and other works. It was not well received, and he returned to Templecarn frustrated and disappointed. During a famine in 1757 he sold all his books to buy oatmeal for distribution to his parishioners, irrespective of their religion, and to supply the women with flax to spin.<br>
<br>In 1759 Skelton published, as a reply to an Arian pamphlet, <span class="italic">An Answer to &#145;An Appeal to the Common Sense of All Christian People&#146;</span>. He was also given the living of Devenish, co. Fermanagh, worth around &pound;300 a year, which allowed him to move to the nearby town of Enniskillen. In Devenish, with a larger congregation, he continued as before. In 1766 he was presented to the more profitable living of Fintona, or Donacavey, co. Tyrone, which proved to be his last. Reputedly he enjoyed some success here in convincing a large number of Presbyterians to conform to the Church of Ireland. In 1770 he published his collected works by subscription, in five volumes; the &pound;500 profit was donated to the Magdalen charity in Dublin. The advent of famine once more in 1778 again saw Skelton sell his library, which he had renewed, in order to provide for the poor. From 1771 he had become non-resident in his parish during the winter months, staying first with a nephew in Drogheda, then in lodgings in Dublin. From 1780 he moved permanently to the capital, while a curate remained at Fintona. In Dublin he continued writing, producing two more volumes to complement his earlier collected works, and a number of hymns and pamphlets.<br>
<br>Skelton died on 4 May 1787 in Dublin, and was buried there on 8 May near the west door of St Peter's Church. His charitable deeds and constant attendance to his clerical duties, lovingly recorded in a hagiographic biography written by his friend and fellow cleric Samuel Burdy, have led to Skelton's being frequently cited by historians of eighteenth-century Ireland as a model clergyman of the Church of Ireland. His published works provide an insight into the mind of a committed reformer, and a devout Anglican. They also reveal a complete aversion to protestant dissent in any form. Despite his professional and personal attributes, and his abilities as a self-publicist, his ambitions within the church were ultimately frustrated. He was apparently denied sustained preferment both by his lack of a powerful patron, and by his own less redeeming qualities of a short temper and a brusque manner.<br>
