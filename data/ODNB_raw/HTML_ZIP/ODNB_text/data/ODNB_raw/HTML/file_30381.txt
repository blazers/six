<span class="headword">Allan, Sir  William</span>  (1837&#150;1903), <span class="occ">engineer and politician</span>, born at Dundee on 29 November 1837, was the third son of James Allan (<i>d</i>. 1883), machine maker, and his wife, Margaret Dickson (<i>d</i>. 1879). After being educated in local schools, Allan served his apprenticeship as an engineer at his father's Seabraes foundry, Dundee. As a journeyman he moved to Glasgow, and in 1856 he went for a short time to Paterson, New Jersey. In 1857 he joined the Royal Navy as engineer, and spent the next three years mainly at foreign stations. In 1861, when the civil war broke out in America, it was said that Allan's &#145;love of adventure&#146; led him to become chief engineer on board a ship seeking to break through the North's blockade of southern ports. He was in Charleston harbour when ships of the federal government bombarded the city on 21 December 1861, and was captured and taken to the Old Capitol Prison, Washington. Released on parole, he returned to Dundee, resuming work at Seabraes foundry. His varied experience had made him a competent workman, and when the North-Eastern Engineering Company was formed at Sunderland in 1866 he was engaged as foreman over one of the departments. However, by 1868 the company was in difficulties, and Allan was appointed manager. Under his control the concern flourished, especially after its removal to Wallsend-on-Tyne. Allan married, in 1870, Jane, daughter of Walter Beattie of Lockerbie. They had at least one son, Walter B. Allan.<br>
<br>In 1886 Allan founded his own company, the Scotia Engine Works, at Sunderland, and he remained active head of the firm until 1900. The business was then amalgamated with the firm of Richardson, Westgarth &amp; Co. Ltd, of which Allan became a director. He was also until his death chairman of the Albyn Line Ltd, shipowners of Sunderland.<br>
<br>From his youth Allan was an advanced radical, and showed practical sympathy with the working classes. He was the first large employer to introduce an eight-hour day in his own works. At a by-election at Gateshead on 24 February 1893 Allan was returned as a Liberal, and continued to represent the town until his death. His speeches in the Commons were known more for their force than their elegance, but were said to display sincerity and common sense. His practical knowledge led him to oppose strenuously the introduction of the Belleville type of boiler into the navy.<br>
<br>In addition to his other activities Allan was, from 1871, a prolific writer of patriotic Scottish songs and poems, publishing volumes such as <span class="italic">Heather-Bells</span> (1875), <span class="italic">Rose and Thistle</span> (1878), <span class="italic">Northern Lights</span> (1889), and <span class="italic">A Book of Poems, Democratic Chants, and Songs, in English and Scottish</span> (1891). His only technical publication was <span class="italic">The Shipowners' and Engineers' Guide to the Marine Engine</span> (1880). Allan served as a JP and deputy lieutenant for co. Durham, and was knighted in 1902. He died from heart disease on 28 December 1903 at Scotland House, Sunderland, and was buried in Ryhope Road cemetery, Sunderland.<br>
