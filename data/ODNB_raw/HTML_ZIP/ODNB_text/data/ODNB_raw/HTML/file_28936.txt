<span class="headword">Webber,  John</span>  (1751&#150;1793), <span class="occ">landscape and portrait painter</span>, was born in London on 6 October 1751, the second and probably oldest surviving of six children of Abraham W&auml;ber (1715&#150;1780), a Swiss sculptor from Bern, Switzerland, who moved to London in the early 1740s, Anglicized his name, and married Mary Quant, a London girl, in 1744. In 1757 straitened circumstances led to Webber's dispatch to Bern, where he was raised by his unmarried aunt Rosina with the family of a celebrated <i>&eacute;b&eacute;niste</i>, Math&auml;us Funk, whose household she ran after the death in 1750 of Funk's wife Maria, another W&auml;ber sister. Rosina recognized his talent and his artistic education was also financially supported by the Bern merchants' corporation, of which the W&auml;bers had been members from 1544. In 1767 Webber was apprenticed to Johann Ludwig Aberli (1723&#150;1786), a leading Swiss topographical artist, who trained him in landscape watercolour drawing and may have introduced him to oils. In 1770 he left to study painting at the Acad&eacute;mie Royale in Paris and with an introduction to the engraver, teacher, and art scholar Jean-Georges Wille (1715&#150;1808), from whom he gained additional skills in recording scenes of rural life. In 1775 Webber returned to London and on 8 April enrolled as a student in the Royal Academy Schools. He also painted portraits and mythological subjects, the latter as house decorations for an unnamed architect who encouraged him to submit works for the Royal Academy exhibition in 1776. Two were views near Paris: one was entitled <span class="italic">Portrait of an Artist</span>, possibly a drawing of his sculptor brother, Henry. These impressed Daniel Solander, botanist on Captain Cook's first Pacific voyage (1768&#150;71), who sought him out and recommended him to the Admiralty as draughtsman for Cook's impending third voyage in the <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Discovery</i>.<br>
<br>Webber was appointed at 100 guineas a year on 24 June 1776 and on 12 July he sailed from Plymouth in Cook's <i>Resolution</i>. His fame largely rests on his fine topographical and ethnographic work from the voyage, planned with Cook and with publication in view. Guided by the surgeon, William Anderson, he also drew natural history subjects (as did William Ellis, surgeon's mate and the other active draughtsman). He returned in October 1780, after Cook's and Anderson's deaths, with over 200 drawings and some twenty portraits in oils, showed a large selection to George III, and was reappointed by the Admiralty at &pound;250 a year to redraw and direct the engraving of sixty-one plates, plus unsigned coastal views, in the official account. It appeared in June 1784 as <span class="italic">A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean &hellip;</span> (3 vols, ed. J. Douglas). Webber also painted other views for the Admiralty, his last payment being in July 1785. He also published two sets of voyage prints; four aquatints made by Marie Catherina Prestel (1787&#150;88: one repeating his own etching of 1786), and sixteen soft-ground etchings by himself (1788&#150;92) of which more were probably intended. The latter were pioneering, both in the medium used and as an artist's rather than publisher's selection. Reissued in aquatint from about 1808 as <span class="italic">Views in the South Seas</span>, they continued to sell into the 1820s.<br>
<br>In 1785 Webber also assisted his older friend P.-J. de Loutherbourg in designing scenery and costumes for the celebrated pantomime <span class="italic">Omai, or, A Trip Round the World</span> at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. Webber resumed exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1784, with two China Sea views and <span class="italic">A party from &hellip; &#145;Resolution&#146; &hellip; shooting sea-horses [<span class="roman">walrus</span>] &hellip; 1778</span>. In 1785 his first South Seas exhibit was a portrait of the Society Islands beauty Poetua, together with views of Macau and Krakatoa. These, except the China Sea pictures of 1784, are all in the National Maritime Museum (Admiralty House collection). All twenty-two exhibits from 1784 to 1787 were subjects from Cook's voyages, with seven more voyage subjects (to 1791) among the twenty-five pictures he exhibited from 1788 to 1792. A portrait excepted (1789), the rest were landscapes in Britain, France, the French and Swiss Alps and around Lake Como, resulting from tours probably encouraged by his artist friends Joseph Farington, Thomas Hearne, and the engraver William Byrne, another Wille pupil who made plates for all three official Cook voyage accounts. In 1786 Webber went to south Wales. In 1787 he visited Wille in Paris, then Lyons, Geneva, northern Italy, and the Alps, and his relations in Bern. In 1788 he returned to south Wales, possibly with the natural historian William Day, who accompanied him to Derbyshire in 1789. In 1790 and 1791 he revisited south and north Wales. He also sketched in the Lake District, possibly in Scotland, in the Isle of Wight and southern England (1792), and continued to paint portraits. Webber was lively, well-liked and professionally successful. He gained the approval and recommendation of Reynolds as a draughtsman (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1785), and was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1785 and Royal Academician in 1791. He died unmarried at his home, 312 Oxford Street, London&#151;where he had moved in 1784 from 3 Bolsover Street&#151;on 29 April 1793, of kidney disease, and left an estate of nearly &pound;5000, with bequests to Swiss family members, servants, and friends, including Farington (one of his executors), Hearne, and Day. Webber had earlier presented his own South Seas ethnographic collection (101 items) to the Library of Bern, where it arrived in 1791. Much of his estate passed to his sculptor brother Henry (1754&#150;1826), a pupil of John Bacon the elder. He also attended the Royal Academy Schools, was a Royal Academy silver and gold medallist in 1774 and 1779 (exh. 1775&#150;6 and 1779), worked extensively for Josiah Wedgwood, and carved Garrick's monument in Westminster Abbey (1795&#150;7).<br>
<br>All John Webber's known voyage work was catalogued by R. Joppien and B. Smith (1988), including his portraits of Cook. The half-length portrait of 1782, then privately owned, is now in the National Portrait Gallery of Australia, Canberra; the original bust length, painted at Cape Town in 1776, is in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and a small full length, painted in or after 1780, in the Museum of New Zealand / Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, New Zealand. A fourth, painted for the Tahitian chief Tu, no longer survives; a fifth, credibly attributed and also not recorded in 1988, is in a private American collection. A portrait of Webber by Johann Daniel Mottet (1812), from a contemporary miniature, is in the Historisches Museum, Bern, which also now holds his ethnographic collection  (Joppien and Smith, pl. 202).<br>
