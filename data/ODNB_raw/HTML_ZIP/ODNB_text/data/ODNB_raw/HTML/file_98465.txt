<span class="headword">Vowell,  Richard Longfield</span>  (1795&#150;1870), <span class="occ">army officer in South America and writer</span>, was baptized at St James's Church, Bath, Somerset, on 24 July 1795, the only son in the family of six children of Richard Vowell (1746&#150;1806) of Hallatrow, near Bath, and of co. Cork, and his wife, Ann Evans, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1807). His father, who had served as a major in the 66th regiment in the West Indies, sat in the Irish parliament as MP for Gorey (1783&#150;90) and was surveyor general for Munster and a Cork county magistrate. Orphaned by the age of twelve, Vowell matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 17 May 1814, aged eighteen, and was elected a scholar in the following month. Some accounts have suggested that he abandoned his university studies in 1815 on inheriting some money, but college records show that on 11 December 1815 he was expelled.<br>
<br>Vowell was, according to George Laval Chesterton, &#145;infected by a prevailing mania&#146; and &#145;resolved to bear arms for the emancipation of Venezuela&#146;  (Chesterton, 140). He crossed the Atlantic aboard the ship <i>Two Friends</i>, arriving at the Danish colony of St Thomas in mid-1817. When the expedition broke up without leadership he joined a group seeking to reach Gregor MacGregor on Amelia Island. When this journey was also unsuccessful he set off to join Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var on the mainland. His service in the independents' army was undistinguished during late 1817 and early 1818. Vowell noted that as he had no time to accustom himself to the new style of horse-riding in Venezuela, his mistakes and discomforts caused &#145;great disorder [in] the ranks and the undisguised merriment of the llaneros&#146;  (R. L. Vowell, <span class="italic">Campaigns and Cruises</span>, 1831, 61). At the battle of Sem&eacute;n (16 March 1818) Vowell was separated from his unit of free black soldiers, the Barloventos. He avoided capture by lying still among the many corpses (or, according to Chesterton, hiding in a bush) until the victors had left the field. He then wandered through Venezuela trying to rejoin Bol&iacute;var's army. These months of encounters with indigenous peoples and <i>llaneros</i> (plainsmen) shaped Vowell's subsequent sympathetic accounts of South American daily life. His experiences on the llanos provided much of the material for the anecdotes, ethnographic descriptions, and eventual plots of his novels. He returned to the republican army, crossing the Andes and reaching Bogot&aacute; in 1820. He continued in the Colombian army and navy throughout the 1820s, serving in Cali, Ecuador, Acapulco, and Baja California before spending the last years of the decade in Chile, at times serving under Lord Thomas Cochrane, including in the defeat of the final royalist garrison, at Chiloe in 1826.<br>
<br>After independence from Spain was assured, Vowell left South America in November 1829 and arrived in Portsmouth in spring 1830. Unlike most of the other mercenaries who enlisted under Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, Vowell not only survived to tell his tales, but was equipped to do so with a sharp sense of observation and a fine literary style. He dedicated a year to writing up his travels, which were published anonymously in three volumes in London in 1831. The first volume, <span class="italic">Campaigns and cruises in Venezuela and New Granada and in the Pacific Ocean, from 1817&#150;1830, with the narrative of a march from the River Orinoco to San Buenaventura on the coast of Choc&oacute; and sketches of the west coast of South America from the gulf of California to the archipelago of Chiloe</span>, was part travel narrative, part chronicle. The second volume was a novel, <span class="italic">The Earthquake of Caraccas</span>, as was the third, <span class="italic">The Savannas of Varinas</span>. Both novels are romances filled with heroic protagonists, thwarted love affairs, period detail, ethnographic digression, and references to the work of Sir Walter Scott. A French translation of the first volume was published in Paris in 1837. <span class="italic">The Earthquake of Caraccas</span> told a love story against the backdrop of the warfare associated with the first Venezuelan republic (1810&#150;13). <span class="italic">The Savannas of Varinas</span> had similar themes, although the action had moved on to the late 1810s, and the setting was now the Venezuelan <i>llanos</i> rather than the capital and coast, with regular cultural descriptions and picaresque episodes punctuating the central love story.<br>
<br>The first Spanish translations of Vowell's works were published in Madrid in 1916. Since then the books have become recognized as among the most reliable and interesting chronicles of the wars of independence in Hispanic America, with new editions published in Spanish in the 1970s. Anonymous publication meant his identity remained a matter of debate among historians until the mid-twentieth century, and authorship of his works was sometimes attributed to Captain William D. Mahoney. Contemporaries also had trouble spelling Vowell's surname, a difficulty that is continued in many library catalogues (variously Vawell, Wovell, Vole, Biold, or Woule). His middle name is also sometimes mistakenly given as Longueville.<br>
<br>Vowell wrote the preface to his three volumes of reflections on his adventures in Bath in 1831, and it has often been assumed that he died there in the late 1830s. It is now established, however, that he arrived in Sydney, New South Wales, as a convict in 1835, and that he died at Bruk Bruk, Casterton, Victoria, Australia, on 18 December 1870, and was buried in Old Casterton cemetery. What crime he had committed, and what he did between 1835 and 1870, remain obscure.<br>
