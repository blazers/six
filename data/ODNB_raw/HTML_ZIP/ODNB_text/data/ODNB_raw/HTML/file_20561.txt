<span class="headword">O'Donovan,  John</span> <span class="st"> [Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Donnabh&aacute;in]</span>  (1806&#150;1861), <span class="occ">Gaelic Irish scholar</span>, the third son and seventh child (of nine) of Edmond Donovan and Eleanor Hoberlin, was born in Atateemore townland, Kilcolumb parish, south co. Kilkenny, on 25 July 1806. He was descended from one Edmond O'Donovan of Bawnlahan, in south-west co. Cork, who had settled in Gaulstown, co. Kilkenny, married the daughter of the last chief of a local Norman family, the Gall Burkes, and died in battle in 1643. John O'Donovan's father died in July 1817. In the previous year the family had been forced by a rent increase to move to a farm at Ballyrowragh, near Atateemore.<br>
<br>John was educated at a local &#145;hedge school&#146; and, from 1821, at a private school (Hunt's academy) in nearby Waterford. In 1822 he opened an evening school at Redgap, in his home parish. He spent a good deal of time at this period with a much travelled uncle, Patrick O'Donovan, who possessed a wealth of folklore and other learning. In 1823 his eldest brother, Michael, went to Dublin in search of employment and John soon followed him. There he attended a &#145;Latin school&#146; (perhaps Dr Doyle's classical academy on Ussher's Island) from late 1823 to 1827. After leaving school, he considered entering Maynooth College as a clerical student, but instead he obtained employment as a scribe from the historian and commissioner of the public records, James Hardiman. He copied Peter O'Connell's Irish dictionary and other Irish manuscripts for Hardiman, but his employment may have been part-time, for in 1828 he transcribed an Irish manuscript, under the supervision of the elderly scholar Edward O'Reilly, for a patron, Myles John O'Reilly of the Heath House, Maryborough, and he also worked as a schoolteacher. When, early in 1830, he became seriously ill, he was invited to stay at the Heath House; as he recuperated he read voraciously and did some light scribal work. While there, he learned of the death of Edward O'Reilly, who had served as a topographical expert to the newly established Ordnance Survey of Ireland. O'Donovan, who two years earlier had given some Irish lessons to the superintendent of the survey, Lieutenant Thomas Aiskew Larcom, applied for and obtained the vacant post. He joined the survey as &#145;Orthographer and Etymologist&#146; on 28 September 1830. Before the end of 1831, O'Donovan made the acquaintance of the scholar and artist George Petrie who would soon be put in charge of the survey's topographical department. That year Petrie had purchased one of the autograph manuscripts of the annals of the four masters, and very soon O'Donovan was working both on it and on a copy of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's great seventeenth-century collection of Irish genealogies. This was to result, more than a decade later, in two of the magnificent editions for which O'Donovan is justly celebrated, his <span class="italic">Hy-Fiachrach</span> in 1844 and his monumental <span class="italic">Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland</span> in 1848&#150;51. In 1832 Petrie established the <span class="italic">Dublin Penny Journal</span> and O'Donovan soon contributed the first of some twenty articles by him which were to appear there over the next eleven months.<br>
<br>O'Donovan resigned from the Ordnance Survey in January 1833 but returned seven months later with a substantial increase in pay. The precise circumstances of the incident are unclear but, on his return, O'Donovan was soon the leading member of Petrie's new topographical department, on which a total of some twenty people served over the next eight years. Early in 1834 O'Donovan embarked on his arduous but invaluable series of fieldwork tours throughout the length and breadth of Ireland to study tens of thousands of place names on behalf of the Ordnance Survey. Covering the country, often on foot, over the next seven years, O'Donovan&#151;with the assistance of a few colleagues, notably O'Conor, O'Curry, and O'Keeffe&#151;sent back to headquarters in Dublin a voluminous and most valuable stream of letters (the celebrated &#145;Ordnance Survey letters&#146;); these dealt with various aspects not alone of the toponymy, but also of the history and antiquities of twenty-nine of the thirty-two counties on the very eve of the great famine. O'Donovan was also closely involved in the production of the only volume to be published of the ill-fated <span class="italic">Ordnance Survey Memoir</span> (1837). Although the topographical department was disbanded rather suddenly by the British government at the end of 1842, O'Donovan was retained by the Ordnance Survey as a part-time adviser on onomastic matters until the time of his death.<br>
<br>On 18 January 1840 John O'Donovan married in Dublin Mary Anne Broughton, a sister-in-law to his colleague in the survey Eugene O'Curry; soon they had a young family to support. When in 1840 the Revd James Henthorn Todd, assistant librarian in Trinity College, Dublin, established the Irish Archaeological Society (IAS), O'Donovan became the first and most prolific contributor to its publications. (He had already worked part-time for Todd since 1836, cataloguing the Irish manuscripts in press H in Trinity College Library.) Almost every year from 1841 to 1846 saw the appearance of an IAS volume meticulously edited and painstakingly annotated by O'Donovan: in 1841 <span class="italic">The Circuit of Ireland &hellip; a Poem Written in 942</span>; in 1842 <span class="italic">The Banquet of Dun na n-Gedh and the Battle of Magh Rath</span>; in 1843 <span class="italic">The Tribes and Customs of Hy-Many</span>; in 1844 <span class="italic">The Genealogies, Tribes and Customs of Hy-Fiachrach</span>; and in 1846 more than half the material in the <span class="italic">Miscellany of the Irish Archaeological Society</span>. Another learned society, the Celtic Society, issued its first publication in 1847, an edition by O'Donovan of the &#145;Book of rights&#146;. The society's <span class="italic">Miscellany</span>, dated 1849 but not published until 1851, contained five items running to a total of more than 460 pages, all edited by O'Donovan. His most exemplary work to date was his encyclopaedic <span class="italic">Hy-Fiachrach</span> (1844), but this was soon to be dwarfed by his greatest achievement, his remarkable edition&#151;including text, translation, and notes&#151;of the annals of the four masters (1848&#150;51; 2nd edn, 1856). Meanwhile, in 1845, he had published the first serviceable <span class="italic">Grammar of the Irish Language</span>, prepared at the urging of J. H. Todd for the use of the recently established St Columba's College. The only other book of his to appear during his lifetime was <span class="italic">Annals of Ireland: Three Fragments &hellip; by Dubhaltach Mac Firbisigh</span>, published in 1860 by the Irish Archaeological and Celtic Society. The same society issued two further works of his posthumously: <span class="italic">The Topographical Poems of John O'Dubhagain and Giolla na Naomh O'Huidhrin</span> (1862) and <span class="italic">The Martyrology of Donegal</span> (1864). In addition to these books, O'Donovan published numerous articles, including seven pieces on the &#145;Origin and meaning of Irish family names&#146; in the <span class="italic">Irish Penny Journal</span> (1841), a dozen or so articles on various topics in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society</span> (later the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland</span>) between 1850 and 1860, eleven in the <span class="italic">Ulster Journal of Archaeology</span> (1857&#150;61), and seven in <span class="italic">Duffy's Hibernian Magazine</span> (1860&#150;61). Moreover, he generously assisted other authors, notably Todd, Hardiman, and Reeves, in preparing editions of various texts and contributed detailed footnotes to the second volume of the Revd Matthew Kelly's edition of John Lynch's <span class="italic">Cambrensis eversus</span> (1849). Among the works on which he laboured but which were brought to completion by others were: <span class="italic">Sanas Cormaic: Cormac's Glossary</span> (from <span class="smallcap">AD</span> <i>c</i>.900), published by Whitley Stokes (Calcutta, 1868); Edward O'Reilly's <span class="italic">Irish Dictionary, with Supplement by O'Donovan</span> (1864); and <span class="italic">The O'Conors of Connaught: an Historical Memoir</span>, edited by Charles Owen O'Conor Don (1891).<br>
<br>O'Donovan in 1849 was appointed to the chair of Celtic languages in the newly established Queen's College, Belfast, having previously been offered a lectureship in the same subject at Cork College. Having no students in Belfast, he fulfilled his obligations by delivering six public lectures each year. He and his family continued to live in Dublin. His acceptance of a post at Queen's College brought him into disfavour with the Catholic hierarchy, including Archbishop John MacHale of Tuam with whom he had been quite friendly. As a result, it was his brother-in-law Eugene O'Curry rather than he who was appointed in 1853 to the chair of Irish archaeology and history in John Henry Newman's new Catholic University in Dublin. Most of the final decade of O'Donovan's life was occupied with work for the Brehon law commission, which had been established in 1852 to prepare for publication the <span class="roman">Ancient Laws of Ireland</span>. However, the difficulties and frustrations encountered by him and his fellow worker O'Curry in relation to the Brehon law commission led to unhappiness and dissension between the two. Then, in early November 1861 O'Donovan caught a severe cold; this developed into rheumatic fever which caused his untimely death, at his home, 36 Upper Buckingham Street, Dublin, on 10 December 1861. His impressive funeral&#151;attended by such eminent personages as Sir Thomas Larcom, under-secretary for Ireland (O'Donovan's former superior in the Ordnance Survey), the president of Maynooth College, and several Church of Ireland clergymen&#151;took place from his house on 13 December to the O'Connell Circle in Glasnevin cemetery, where his grave is marked by a stone memorial. The dimensions of the funeral and the location of the grave reflected the widespread recognition of O'Donovan as the greatest Irish scholar of the nineteenth century; already, as early as 1833, George Petrie had declared him &#145;the most able and judicious Irish scholar and topographer Ireland has produced for the last century&#146;  (&#145;The abbey of Inch, county of Down&#146;, <span class="italic">Dublin Penny Journal</span>, 8 June 1833, 396). The passage of a century and a half has done little to dim scholarly admiration for the pioneering and enduring work of the little scholar (5 feet 2 inches in height) from south Kilkenny.<br>
<br>O'Donovan was survived by his wife, Mary Anne, who died in 1893, and by six of their nine sons, aged from nineteen down to five years. Four of the sons later became involved with the Fenian Brotherhood; the most celebrated of these, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20560/', "Edmund O'Donovan (1844&#150;1883)")</script>, went on to have a particularly colourful career which included a period in the French Foreign Legion, assignments as a &#145;war correspondent&#146; (a novel designation) in Spain and Bosnia, a daring journey to the Merv oasis on the borders of Afghanistan in central Asia, and a fatal final assignment to the Sudan in 1883 to cover the revolt of the Mahdi.<br>
