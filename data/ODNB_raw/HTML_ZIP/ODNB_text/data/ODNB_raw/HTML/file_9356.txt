<span class="headword">Ferrar,  Nicholas</span>  (1593&#150;1637), <span class="occ">religious writer and administrator</span>, was born in the city of London on 22 February 1593 and was baptized on 28 February at St Mary's, Stayning Lane. He was the fifth of six surviving children of Nicholas Ferrar (1544/5&#150;1620), a successful merchant adventurer and master of the Skinners' Company, and his wife, Mary (1553/4&#150;1634), daughter of Lawrence Wodenoth of Shavington Hall, Cheshire. As a sickly child he relied heavily on his mother, who was known as a woman of piety and who raised him on Foxe's <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>, from which he traced the history of the martyr <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9357/', "Bishop Robert Ferrar (d. 1555)")</script>, though there is no evidence that they were related. At the age of seven Nicholas was sent to a school at Enborne, near Newbury in Berkshire. As a precocious pupil he proceeded to Clare College, Cambridge, as a pensioner once he became a teenager, &#145;when yet his deportment was such as spake him more a man than many are at foure and twenty&#146;  (Forbes, 2.397), as his contemporary Dr Robert Byng recalled of him in September 1654. There his tutor was Augustine Lindsell, later bishop of Peterborough and of Hereford. Within a year Ferrar was a fellow-commoner, so widely appreciated was his scholarly mien. In 1610 he graduated BA and according to Byng made the oration to the university on the anniversary of the coronation (25 July 1610). He was elected a fellow of the college that year, with a view to studying medicine. Life in Cambridge seems to have been agreeable, with his only sister living 10 miles west of the university at Bourn with her husband, John Collett, and their nine or ten children.<br>
<br>Soon after his twentieth birthday Ferrar left Cambridge, largely on the medical advice of the celebrated Clare physician, William Butler, who had also prescribed Ferrar with tobacco to cure his insomnia. He spent the years 1613&#150;17 out of England, travelling on the continent and learning Dutch, German, Italian, French, and Spanish. Initially he was part of the retinue of the newly married Princess Elizabeth and Frederick, elector palatine. Ferrar had been introduced to Frederick in 1613 during the latter's visit to Cambridge with his brother-in-law, Charles, duke of York, by Robert Scot, master of Clare College. Scot had been sub-almoner to James VI and I, serving in the Chapel Royal, and would have known members of the court. Before setting out Ferrar was granted his MA, although he was not of sufficient standing in the university. He travelled with the retinue to the Netherlands, but he soon left them and travelled independently to Hamburg, Leipzig, and Prague before entering Italy by way of southern Germany. He spent time in Padua, where he continued his studies in medicine and could have had firsthand experience of the congregation of the oratory of St Philip Neri, and around Venice, where the English ambassador, Sir Dudley Carleton, welcomed him, but he also travelled to Rome and the Vatican as well as to Malta, and perhaps also to Vienna. He returned through France (where he nearly died of a severe fever at Marseilles in April 1616) before going to Spain. Without money, and motivated by a revelation that his family were in need, he walked the 450 kilometres from Madrid to the coast to take ship at San Sebastian.<br>
<br>When Ferrar reached England in 1617 he intended to resume his fellowship, but his elderly parents requested he remain with them in London. In 1619 he turned down the offer of a professorship of geometry at the newly founded Gresham College, and instead became closely involved with the Virginia Company. Ferrar's father was a member, as he was also, of the East India Company; his elder brother William had emigrated to Virginia in 1619 (but died either <i>en route</i> or soon after his arrival) and his other brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60958/', "John Ferrar (c.1588&#150;1657)")</script> became deputy of the company in the same year. It is possible that Ferrar himself may have co-written, with Thomas Winston, his successor as physic fellow at Clare, <span class="italic">A Declaration of the State of the Colonie and Affaires in Virginia</span>. Issued by the king's council for Virginia in June 1620, the book contained a series of pamphlets and declarations relating to shipping and supplies as well as for the better governance of the colony. In May 1621 Ferrar was admitted to the company's council and was made treasurer of a glass company in the colony, and on 22 May 1622, when John Ferrar's three-year fixed term appointment expired, he succeeded his brother as deputy of the company. Throughout 1622 and 1623 Ferrar was regularly summoned to the privy council, where he vigorously defended the interests of the leadership of the Virginia Company, headed by Sir Edwin Sandys and the earl of Southampton, against the great London merchants led by Sir Thomas Smythe, whose party was later accused by John Ferrar of being pro-Spanish. In May 1623 he was even put under house arrest &#145;for a contempt of an order at the Council Table against the use of bitter invective&#146;  (Kingsbury, 1.108). The Virginia Company, after much political machination, lost its patent in May 1624, following a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> in November 1623 and the records of the company from 1619 onwards survive only because Ferrar undertook to pay for their attested transcription before they were seized (November 1623&#150;June 1624). In reward for his service, particularly his auditing of its accounts, the company granted him (4 February 1624) twenty shares of land in Virginia as his reward. Ferrar wrote an attack on Sir Thomas Smythe, explaining the woes of the company as arising from Smythe's misgovernment when treasurer before 1619 and his subsequent attempts to regain power. Though probably intended for pamphlet publication it did not see print until 1990.<br>
<br>Following in the steps of his brother John, who had sat for Tamworth in 1621 under the patronage of Lord Paget, Ferrar was returned to parliament for Lymington in 1624, on the nomination of the earl of Southampton, in order to promote the company's interests and to support the fledgeling colony. When &#145;the Lower House entered, though reluctantly, upon the case of the Virginia Company, the disensions in which threaten its ruin&#146;  (Francis Nethersole to Sir Dudley Carleton, 6 May 1624, TNA: PRO, SP 14/164/46), Ferrar himself listed no fewer than fifty-two MPs who were freemen of the company, &#145;yett have not had [any parte <i>erased</i>] nor followde the buisinesse for sundry yeares&#146;  (BL microfilm, RP 420, Manchester MSS, item 371). At least another fifty members of that parliament were either freemen or the kinsmen of freemen, and no fewer than fourteen members of the upper house were also adventurers or councillors. Ferrar played a very public role in parliament in the prosecution of Lionel Cranfield, first earl of Middlesex, the lord treasurer, at his impeachment. Middlesex had been the chief critic of the policies of the Virginia Company and as deputy it was only to be supposed that Ferrar would speak out against him. Ferrar joined Lord Cavendish, Sir John Danvers, and Sir Edwin Sandys on 28 April in opening the proceedings against the beleaguered Middlesex; the following day Middlesex told the king that they did &#145;yesterday make invective oration against me four hours together about the Virginia business &hellip; all which they laid wholly upon me&#146;  (Prestwich, 437n.). Forty-three unnumbered folios of Ferrar's parliamentary diary survive (Magdalene College, Cambridge, Ferrar MSS 1433), but they cover only the first month of the sitting and so do not give more than a glimpse of how active the Virginians would become in the house under Sir Edwin Sandys or reveal how open to criticism the role of Ferrar and of other senior company figures was found to be. After the dissolution of parliament Ferrar chose to concentrate on family matters and did not stand for parliament again. Apart from a brief three-year period from 1631, when he and his brother John were both again appointed commissioners of the Virginia Company, he held no public office.<br>
<br>In 1625 Ferrar, using his mother's dower, bought a small manor at Little Gidding in Huntingdonshire [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/68969', "Little Gidding community")</script>] from John Ferrar's bankrupt business partner, Thomas Sheppard, thereby protecting John from financial ruin. It was there that the unmarried Nicholas moved with her the following year, to be joined by brother John, John's wife and children, and his sister's household from Cambridgeshire. Little Gidding itself was a &#145;dispopulated&#146;  (Muir and White, para. 69) village and the arrival of an extended family (including servants) of forty helped to revive it. While his mother put the church repair in order, Ferrar set about preparing himself for ordination, to better lead the spiritual life of his family and emphasize his distance from worldly concerns. In February 1626 he was duly ordained deacon at Westminster Abbey at the hands of William Laud, bishop of St David's, his old tutor Lindsell being present. Ferrar refused a range of benefices offered him by his former Virginia associates as well as George Herbert's offer of the prebend of Leighton Bromswold. With his brother John acting as a site manager and clerk of works Ferrar instead, partly funded by Leighton Bromswold's landowner, Katherine, duchess of Lennox, set about refurbishing Herbert's church, a project for which he was well suited.<br>
<br>The life of the household, subsequently caricatured as &#145;the Arminian nunnery&#146; in the 1641 pamphlet of that name, was dedicated to the daily reading and discussion of scripture, rigorous education (including household accounting and basic medical skills for Ferrar's nieces) and to the craft of bookbinding. Ferrar continued to work as a scholar; the family, at first under his direction, produced at least six harmonies of the gospels, while Ferrar himself translated Valdes and Lessius, on temperance, and made a translation (now lost) of Carbone. He also worked on editing Herbert's <span class="italic">The Temple</span> after his friend's death, and was much visited by Cambridge friends and others. Charles I borrowed a biblical harmony in 1633, and visited in 1642 and 1646, after Ferrar's death. Early in December 1637 Ferrar determined that his grave should be 7 feet west of the church door, in order to leave room for the tomb of his brother John, and when he died at Little Gidding on 4 December he was duly interred there on 7 December without a monument. The intended inscription, in Latin, has been attributed to another Cambridge poet, Richard Crashaw, with puns on his &#145;virginal purity&#146;  (Forbes, 2.584). Ferrar's life, including the history of the community at Little Gidding, was written subsequently by his brother John. It is ironic that it should have been the attacks on the household by puritan detractors, most notably <span class="italic">The Arminian Nunnery</span> of 1641, which fuelled, in reaction, the enthusiasm of pious Victorians, who interpreted Little Gidding as a precedent for Anglican monasticism, and secured for Ferrar eventual inclusion in the Anglican cycle of prayer.<br>
<br>The family at Little Gidding was gradually reduced by death and marriage. After 1643 most of the family were in exile in the Low Countries, but were back to welcome Charles I on his secret visit on his flight to the Scots in 1646. The Ferrars' detractors were concerned both by the beauty of holiness, condemning &#145;their <i>Crosses</i> on the outside and inside of the <i>Chappell</i>&#146; and &#145;an <i>Altar</i> richly decked with <i>Tapestry</i>, <i>Plate</i> and <i>Tapers</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Arminian Nunnery</span>, 2), and the liturgical style of &#145;<i>Adorations</i>, <i>genuflections</i>, and <i>geniculations</i>&#146;  (ibid.), as well as by the emphasis given to prayer rather than to the hearing of sermons. The local ministers of Great and Steeple Gidding came in to preach and administer communion but it is clear that the daily recitation of the psalter, saying the litany and praying twice a day (morning and evening prayer were said according to Cranmer's rubric, publicly) in the chapel and four times in the house, using prayers for the family, and monthly communion, predominated. Ferrar's own reputation for holiness, fostered by Isaak Walton and later writers, in part derived from his long-term weakening illnesses and his scholarly mien, but also from his reputation as a teacher and administrator. While not a monastic community, despite the idealizations of eighteenth-century nonjurors and nineteenth-century Anglo-Catholics, nor congregationalist in the strict sense, given Ferrar's regard for episcopal authority and his friendship with bishops, none the less Ferrar's Little Gidding drew heavily on the early church model recorded in the second chapter of the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>.<br>
