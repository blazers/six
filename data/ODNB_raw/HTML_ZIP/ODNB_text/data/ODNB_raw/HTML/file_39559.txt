<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Philip</span>  (1728/9&#150;1790), <span class="occ">dean of Norwich</span>, was the son of Philip Lloyd of Greenwich, gentleman. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 15 May 1746; he graduated BA (1749) and proceeded MA (1752) and DD (1763), and was elected a student. He was tutor, at Stowe in Buckinghamshire, to the family of the first Earl Temple, and remained close to his pupils, the future second earl and his brother, William Grenville. He and his wife, Joyce (1722/3&#150;1801), were childless.<br>
<br>Lloyd was appointed a prebendary of Westminster in 1763, and resigned in 1765 on being presented to the rectory of Puddletown in Dorset and the deanery of Norwich. He owed his preferment chiefly to the Grenvilles, and gossip had it that &#145;A recommendation from any of the Temple family would do everything with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Neville</span>, 308). He was reckoned to be &#145;the commanding officer&#146; of the diocese of Norwich in Bishop Yonge's time, and a person of great influence  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Lloyd proved an energetic dean. Within three months of his installation a major renovation of the cathedral was agreed by the dean and chapter, to be paid for from their own funds, at the rate of &pound;300 a year for three years. Thomas Pitt, who had previously worked for the Grenvilles at Stowe, advised, and the architect was probably Thomas Ivory of Norwich. The medieval choir stalls were renovated, the screen which had been put across the apse was removed, and the window at the east end, blocked when the lady chapel was demolished, was opened and glazed. Other major repairs undertaken during Lloyd's time included overhauling the turrets on the transepts and strengthening the spire. A programme was put in hand for repairing the lead roofs and repointing and replacing decayed stone. A &#145;moving scaffold&#146; was constructed to clean the vaults.<br>
<br>In 1776 painted glass, given to the chapter by Norwich corporation, was fitted in windows at the east end of the choir, and in 1777 Joyce Lloyd designed a painted window for the choir clerestory; in 1780 she designed another window based on Raphael's <span class="italic">Transfiguration</span>.<br>
<br>Lloyd had a technical interest in the building. The reason for reopening the blocked east window was to create a through draught which, he said, would &#145;keep the church free from damp&#146;  (memoranda book, Norfolk RO, DCN 118/1). In 1770 he consulted the Royal Society about installing a lightning conductor on the spire. He was concerned for the quality of music at cathedral services, securing the assent of the chapter to the appointment of an additional counter-tenor to the choir. He also ensured that daily prayers should continue in the cathedral undisturbed by workmen during the restoration of the choir. He was a careful administrator, and personally maintained a record of the repairs to the cathedral and its properties, along with careful notes on the administration of the estates managed by the dean and chapter. He also had the accounts of the cathedral priory arranged in chronological order from 1274 to 1537, noting that: &#145;from them might be extracted a <span class="italic">Chronicon Pretionum</span> which would include not only the price of every kind of Grain (which the Bailiffs bought and sold) but of almost every article of consumption and the wages of every kind of Workman&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Lloyd died on 31 May 1790, and was buried in the choir of Norwich Cathedral, where he is commemorated by a wall monument by John Ivory. His wife died on 4 April 1801, aged seventy-eight.<br>
<br>At his death the <span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span> noted:<blockquote>If an inflexible firmness of mind in resisting the importunities of the powerful, when inconsistent with the most refined attention to the interest of the body over which he presided can endear this good man to posterity, we can assure ourselves of the justest tribute of applause to his memory.</blockquote>
