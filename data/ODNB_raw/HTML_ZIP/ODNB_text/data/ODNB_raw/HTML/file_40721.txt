<span class="headword">Harris, Sir  John Hobbis</span>  (1874&#150;1940), <span class="occ">campaigner against slavery</span>, was born on 29 July 1874 at Grove Street, Wantage, the son of John Hobbis Harris, plumber (and later a builder), and his wife, Elizabeth Emily Saunders. An earnest Christian, young John Harris spent all his free time doing evangelical social work in the common lodging houses under the leadership of F. B. Meyer of Christ Church, Westminster Bridge Road, London. While working as a twenty-year-old in the City of London for Cooks, the gentlemen's outfitters, he also began to train to become a Baptist missionary in central Africa. Together with his wife, Alice (1870&#150;1970), daughter of Alfred Seeley, a silk works manager, whom he had just married (on 6 May), Harris sailed for the Congo in May 1898. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>At first Harris concentrated on learning the language and customs of the people of his part of the Congo Free State, and in teaching basic skills such as housebuilding. But very soon he was forced to witness such abominations in the treatment of the local people by agents of King Leopold II of the Belgians that, instead of bringing Christ to pagan Africa, Harris had to respond to the revelation that it was the Christians who were now the crucifiers. He watched horrifed as Africans were lashed mercilessly with a long whip of twisted hippopotamus hide by other Africans who would be flogged themselves if they refused to obey European orders. Shortly afterwards he and his wife were shown the amputated hand and foot of a five-year-old girl by her distraught father. The source of all this horror was King Leopold's insatiable demand for rubber and ivory which his company extracted from the Congo, ostensibly via a &#145;civilizing&#146; mission but in fact by slavery, hostage-taking, the torture and mutilation of women and children, the burning of whole villages, and, when necessary, mass murder. The Harrises realized that they must abandon private protest for public action. The British consul, Roger Casement, and the investigative journalist E. D. Morel joined with John Harris to inform the British government of the atrocities and to urge it to intervene. But at first no one in high places responded except Charles Dilke, Lord Lansdowne, and H. R. Fox Bourne. In 1903&#150;4 John and Alice Harris supplied E. D. Morel's Congo Reform Association with a detailed account, attested by Alice Harris's photographic evidence, of the deliberate system of atrocity being perpetrated. In December 1904 John Harris was asked by the local Africans to represent their case and translate their submissions to King Leopold's (packed) commission of enquiry. Its reluctant, shameful, findings were eventually published in October 1905, but without any of Harris's damning evidence. John Harris himself then published the pamphlet <span class="italic">Rubber is Death: the Story of the Bonguronga Rubber Collectors</span>, enumerating case after case, giving the names of the victims and their families, many of them known to him personally. &#145;Again and again when these horrors have been brought to our notice, we have been ashamed that our skin is white &hellip; Has the conscience of Christian England gone to sleep?&#146;  (Harris, 21).<br>
<br>Despite the fact that they had to leave behind their own small children in Britain, and at real risk not only to their health but to their lives, Alice and John Harris continued &#145;to march round the world &hellip; laying before the public the evidence [of] &hellip; the barbarous nature of the system&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anti-Slavery Reporter and Aborigines' Friend</span>, April 1911). Supported by the evidence of the actual whips and chains used and the sixty photographs of both victims and perpetrators taken by Alice Harris (made into lantern slides), the Harrises spoke in the cause of Congo reform at well over 600 public meetings in Britain, Europe, and the United States before 1910. In 1911 they travelled 5000 miles, on river steamer, by canoe, or on foot through almost impenetrable tropical forests, on a fact-finding investigation of current conditions in central and west Africa.<br>
<br>John Harris became a political crusader against white capitalist imperialism in general, advocating a system of genuine, international trusteeship in the interests of all native peoples on every continent. Between 1910 and 1940 he produced a number of important articles and books on the topic, including <span class="italic">Dawn in Darkest Africa</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Africa, Slave or Free?</span> (1919), and <span class="italic">Slavery or &#145;Sacred Trust&#146;?</span> (1926). In these he identified usurpation of land as the root of the evil that then led to forced labour in order to exploit the mineral resources and products of the soil. Harris redefined contract labour and debt bondage as neo-slavery; he insisted that the native should see some benefit for all his taxation and, unlike most of his contemporaries at the beginning of the twentieth century, he believed that the native races had as much right to self-determination as any one else.<br>
<br>From 1910 to 1940 John Harris was parliamentary secretary to the amalgamated Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection societies. In 1923 he was elected Liberal MP for Hackney North, but lost his seat at the next election in 1924. As a member of the national executive of the League of Nations Union, he visited Geneva every year and added international lobbying on behalf of all the native races to his workload. In 1933 John Harris was knighted in acknowledgement of his part in getting the League of Nations to accept British proposals for the suppression of slavery world wide. According to Lord Lytton, &#145;It was the <i>thing</i> slavery, not merely the <i>word</i>, which he worked to abolish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anti-Slavery Reporter and Aborigines' Friend</span>, July 1940). Therefore Harris also tackled the abuse of <i>mui tsai</i>&#151;&#145;adopted daughters&#146;&#151;in domestic servitude in Hong Kong, Malaya, and Ceylon; he placed questions in parliament to challenge the use of ten-year-old African children as labourers in British Kenya; he investigated and criticized the endemic, systematic oppression of black people both in the southern states of America and in southern Africa; and he was one of the earliest to monitor and criticize white Australia's racist oppression of the Aborigines. In addition, John Harris would never refuse a request to help individual Africans finding themselves in difficulties in London. Not surprisingly he wore himself out.<br>
<br>Sir John Harris died suddenly from bronchitis and a cerebral haemorrhage on 30 April 1940, at Stonelands, Bath Road, Frome, Somerset. Obituaries glow with regard for the meticulous integrity of his research, and for his tireless, courageous altruism: &#145;He was afraid of nobody&#146;, wrote Gilbert Murray  (<span class="italic">Anti-Slavery Reporter</span>, October 1941). According to Charles Roden Buxton, &#145;He was a truly lovable man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Friend</span>, 10 May, 1940). The burial, probably on 6 May, and memorial services were conducted by the Society of Friends, which Harris had joined after the First World War.<br>
