<span class="headword">Dennis,  Nigel Forbes</span>  (1912&#150;1989), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 16 January 1912 in Bletchingley, Surrey, the younger child and only son of Lieutenant-Colonel (Michael) Frederick Beauchamp Dennis 
    (Fred; <i>d</i>. 1918)
   and his wife, Louise Marguerite Jermyn, youngest daughter of Theodore and Merelina Bosanquet, whose family were descendants of Huguenots from the Languedoc region of France. His parents lived in north Devon. As a young man Michael Dennis had tried his fortune in South Africa, fought in the South African War, and then settled in Southern Rhodesia, where Nigel's sister, Dorothy, was born. He returned to Britain on the outbreak of the First World War and enlisted in the King's Own Scottish Borderers; he was killed in 1918. In 1920 his widow married his best friend, Fitzroy Griffin, and the whole family returned to Rhodesia. Nigel was sent first to Plumtree School, Southern Rhodesia, and then to St Andrew's, Grahamstown, South Africa, which he had to leave early on account of attacks of epilepsy, an affliction which had struck him at the age of about eleven and against which he bore up courageously for the rest of his life. He had a half-brother and a half-sister.<br>
<br>From South Africa, Dennis was dispatched to Kitzb&uuml;hel in Austria, where an uncle, A. Ernan Forbes Dennis, husband of the novelist Phyllis Bottome and friend of the psychologist Alfred Adler, was running a sort of crammer for would-be entrants to the Foreign Office (Peter and Ian Fleming were fellow pupils in Dennis's time) and also acting as British consul. From there he moved on, at his uncle's suggestion, to the Odenwaldschule in Bavaria, a progressive, co-educational establishment at the opposite pole, educationally speaking, to Plumtree and St Andrew's. Dennis, whose youthful literary ambitions had been expressed in stories contributed to the <span class="italic">Boy's Own Paper</span> (until a hot one from the Odenwaldschule caused the editor to disengage), was very soon writing a novel about this experience. Called <span class="italic">Chalk and Cheese</span>, it was published a few years later, in 1934, under the pseudonym Richard Vaughan. Dennis later chose to disown it.<br>
<br>After a further unsettled period (more tutoring, this time in Wales; helping his family, by now repatriated, to run a small hotel in Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds called &#145;The Live and Let Live&#146;, where the young Graham Greenes were neighbours; and selling ladies' garments door-to-door) Dennis got his lucky break. A legacy enabled him to travel steerage to New York and a dockers' strike prevented him from returning on the appointed date. He stayed eighteen years, working first as an assiduous freelance, writing stories and articles and helping to translate the writings of Adler, then landing salaried jobs. He became (improbably) secretary of the national board of the <span class="italic">Review of Motion Pictures</span> (1935) and was assistant editor and book reviewer of the <span class="italic">New Republic</span> (1937&#150;8) and staff reviewer of <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine (from 1940). In 1949 he published his first acknowledged novel, <span class="italic">Boys and Girls Come out to Play</span> (<span class="italic">A Sea Change</span> in the USA), which won the Anglo-American novel award for that year (shared with Anthony West). It starts very personally, with a description of a young man having an epileptic fit.<br>
<br>Dennis returned to England in 1950 and five years later published <span class="italic">Cards of Identity</span>, the novel which made his name. Its theme&#151;the ease with which modern man, uncertain of who he is, can be manipulated by charlatans&#151;was advanced and piquant. At the request of George Devine, of the English Stage Company, Dennis turned it into a play; it was produced in London at the Royal Court Theatre in 1956. A second play, <span class="italic">The Making of Moo</span>, an anti-religious send-up which caused protests in the stalls, followed a year later and in 1958 both were published in book form as <span class="italic">Two Plays and Preface</span>&#151;the preface being a Voltairean swipe at theologians such as St Augustine and a paean of praise for satirists such as Aristophanes. His last play, <span class="italic">August for the People</span>, was produced in 1961.<br>
<br>Dennis's books were few but distinguished: <span class="italic">Dramatic Essays</span> (1962), a collection worth pondering for its radical approach; <span class="italic">Jonathan Swift</span> (1964), a study of one of his heroes, which won the Royal Society of Literature award under the W. H. Heinemann bequest (1966); and a haunting last novel, <span class="italic">A House in Order</span> (1966), which showed the influence of Franz Kafka and the author's passion for gardening. In 1967 he moved to Malta and two final volumes&#151;<span class="italic">Exotics</span> (1970), a book of Mediterranean poems, and the short, quirky, bellicose <span class="italic">An Essay on Malta</span> (1972), with illustrations by Osbert Lancaster&#151;were inspired by this new scene.<br>
<br>From its launch in February 1961 until his retirement twenty years later Dennis was lead reviewer of the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>. His admixture of wit, acuteness, and common sense made him an unfailing draw. Between 1963 and 1970 he was drama critic, contributor, and finally co-editor of <span class="italic">Encounter</span> magazine, but this association ended in acrimony. He wrote for, and read on, radio.<br>
<br>Dennis was tall, somewhat sardonic-looking, and with facial corrugations in his later years which rivalled, but could not quite match, those of his admired W. H. Auden. A fine conversationalist when the mood took him, he could also be elusive and tortuous: not for nothing had he fielded in boyhood for B. J. T. Bosanquet, the famous cricketer who invented the googly. He was twice married: first in 1936, to Marie-Madeleine, daughter of Avit (Jean) Massias, a farmer from the Charente in France; the couple had two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1956 and in 1959 he married Beatrice Ann Hewart Matthew, a most spirited support and scribe. She was the daughter of William Alexander Matthew, a director of his family's shipping firm in Cardiff. Dennis died on 19 July 1989 in Little Compton, near Moreton in Marsh, Warwickshire, at the home of his elder daughter.<br>
