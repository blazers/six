<span class="headword">Dillon,  Arthur</span>, Count Dillon in the French nobility  (1750&#150;1794), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service</span>, the second son of Henry Dillon, eleventh Viscount Dillon (1705&#150;1787), also an army officer in the French service and a French count, and his wife, Lady Charlotte Lee, and the nephew of Arthur Richard Dillon, archbishop of Narbonne, was born on 3 September 1750 at Braywick, Berkshire. In 1768 he married Lucy de Rothe (1751&#150;1782), the daughter of General &Eacute;douard de Rothe (1710&#150;1766) and Lucie Cary (1728&#150;1804). She became lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette. The couple had one surviving child, Henriette Lucy (1770&#150;1853), who in 1787 married the marquis de La Tour du Pin; she later wrote her memoirs, <span class="italic">Journal d'une femme de cinquante ans</span>. In 1785 Dillon married, secondly, Marie de Girardin de Montgirald, comtesse de La Touche, a widow; they had one daughter, Elisabeth Frances (Fanny), who married General Bertrand in 1808. As the younger son of a French count, he was known in France as Count Dillon.<br>
<br>A junior officer in the family regiment, Dillon became its proprietary colonel on 25 August 1767, but did not take command until five years later, on 1 May 1772. During the American War of Independence he participated in combat at Grenada, St Eustatius, Savannah, Tobago, and St Kitts, of which he served as governor (1782&#150;3). He was named brigadier on 1 March 1780 and major-general on 1 January 1784, and was governor of Tobago from 1786 to 1789. As deputy for Martinique in the national assembly of 1789 he defended colonial interests but generally voted with the liberals. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 13 January 1792 and served under the command of Lafayette and of Dumouriez during the fighting of July to October. Because of his ambivalent response to the overthrow of the monarchy on 10 August and his correspondence with the landgrave of Hesse, he was recalled to Paris to explain his conduct on 13 October and suspended from his duties five weeks later. He was reinstated on 23 February 1793 and associated with Camille Desmoulins, but was again suspended on 1 June; on 13 July he was arrested and imprisoned in the Luxembourg. He was accused of being a leader of an alleged royalist conspiracy and was condemned to death by the revolutionary tribunal on 13 April 1794. The following day he was executed in Paris, together with Lucille Desmoulins, who met her death nine days after her husband.<br>
