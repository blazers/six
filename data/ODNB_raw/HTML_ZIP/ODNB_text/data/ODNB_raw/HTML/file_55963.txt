<span class="headword">Eccles,  Charlotte  O'Conor</span>  (1863&#150;1911), <span class="occ">journalist and novelist</span>, was born in Roscommon, Ireland, on 1 November 1863, the elder surviving daughter of Alexander O'Conor-Eccles of Ballinagard, near Roscommon. She was educated in Catholic convents at Upton Hall, near Birkenhead, and in Paris and Germany. Her European education was probably the source of her good knowledge of continental languages. A lecturer in Ireland for the board of agriculture and technical instruction, she was particularly interested in housing for the poor, and collaborated with Horace Plunkett in schemes for rural regeneration. In politics she was a supporter of home rule for Ireland.<br>
<br>On taking up residence in London, probably in late 1890 or early 1891, Charlotte O'Conor Eccles sought work as a newspaper journalist, which she preferred to work on magazines, which she felt to be irregular and precarious. She had previous newspaper experience in Dublin, helping to sub-edit an evening newspaper, for which she undertook translations from American, Australian, French, and German periodicals, corrected proof, did general reporting, and conducted a ladies' column. Her article &#145;The experience of a woman journalist&#146;  (Eccles) describes vividly the difficulty she encountered in finding employment. In it she commented &#145;One is horribly handicapped in being a woman&#146;. Her first big break came when she was hired by the London office of the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span>, where she was put on the staff at a salary of 3 guineas per week. The <span class="italic">Herald</span> had a short life (2 February 1889 to 31 May 1891); she worked during the last six months of its existence and gained valuable experience. Thereafter, as she mastered the technicalities of the London newspaper world, she worked variously as sub-editor of a woman's paper, for weeklies, as London correspondent to provincial papers, and as a freelance. Other articles identified as hers include &#145;Irish housekeeping and customs in the last century&#146; (<span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, December 1888), &#145;A royal elopement&#146; (<span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, 3rd ser., no. 48, 1890, 302&#150;18), and &#145;Hospital where plague broke out&#146; (<span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, no. 272, 1899, 591&#150;602). Others have yet to be identified. She was on the staffs of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> and <span class="italic">The Star</span>.<br>
<br>As a novelist Charlotte O'Conor Eccles published <span class="italic">The Rejuvenation of Miss Semaphore</span> (1897), using the pseudonym Hal Godfrey, and <span class="italic">The Matrimonial Lottery</span> (1906). She translated from the Polish a novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz, a Nobel laureate, which was published in America in 1899 as <span class="italic">Peasants of the West</span> and in England as <span class="italic">Aliens of the West</span> (1904). She was a fellow of the Institute of Journalists and a member of the Writers', Lyceum, and Ladies' Park clubs in London. She died unmarried on 14 June 1911, at the age of forty-six at her home, 139A Alexandra Road, St John's Wood, London, of cerebral thrombosis.<br>
