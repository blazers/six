<span class="headword">Wills,  William Henry</span>, first Baron Winterstoke  (1830&#150;1911), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, was born at Bristol on 1 September 1830, the second son and only surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61718/', "William Day Wills (1797&#150;1865)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58453/', "Wills family (per. c.1786&#150;1928)")</script>], tobacco manufacturer, and his wife, Mary, third daughter of Robert Steven of Glasgow and Camberwell, Surrey. Wills's grandfather, the first <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50561/', "Henry Overton Wills (1761&#150;1826)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58453/', "Wills family")</script>], became the dominant partner in a small Bristol tobacco business which his sons and grandsons greatly developed. A number of H. O. Wills's grandchildren subsequently became prominent in public affairs in Bristol. They included Sir Edward Payson Wills (1834&#150;1910) of Hazelwood, Stoke Bishop, who gave the Jubilee Convalescent Home to Bristol, and was created a baronet on 19 August 1904, and Sir Frederick Wills (1838&#150;1909) of Northmoor, near Dulverton, who was Unionist MP for North Bristol from 1900 to 1906, and was likewise created a baronet on 15 February 1897.<br>
<br>The Wills family were Congregationalists, and young William Henry, after early training at home, went to the nonconformist public school at Mill Hill, London, which he left as head of the sixth form and captain. Illness prevented him from completing his studies for a London University degree, or going to the bar. When about eighteen he entered the family tobacco and snuff business at Bristol, of which his father was junior partner. On 11 January 1853 he married Elizabeth (1831/2&#150;1896), daughter of John Stancombe of Trowbridge, Wiltshire; they did not have any children, but adopted two daughters.<br>
<br>Wills's first position was as a commercial traveller, selling the expanding range of branded smoking tobaccos. He soon acquired a thorough knowledge of the trade and of the growth and treatment of tobacco, and with his first cousins Henry Overton Wills (1828&#150;1911) and Edward Payson Wills he was taken into partnership in 1858 and the firm styled W. D. and H. O. Wills &amp; Sons.<br>
<br>Wills became the senior partner in the firm by virtue of the fact that he inherited all his father's share in the business in 1865. Together with Henry Overton Wills, he was responsible for establishing Wills's tobacco brands nationally, and also for developing a thriving export trade. The firm was subsequently converted into a limited-liability company and Wills became chairman of the board of directors.<br>
<br>Wills's technical knowledge and real business ability promoted the success of the firm, and helped to meet such difficulties as the failures of the tobacco-leaf crop and the stoppage of supplies during the American Civil War. He became the recognized head of the tobacco trade in Great Britain. In 1878 he was unanimously elected chairman of the committee organized to resist a threatened increase of duty on tobacco.<br>
<br>From 1880 Wills ceased to have an active role in the management of the firm. He remained as chairman until his death, however, and continued to play a significant role in the formation of the firm's business strategy. He supported his nephews <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36939/', "George Alfred Wills")</script> and Henry Herbert Wills in their decision to acquire UK rights to the Bonsack cigarette-making machine in 1883, and also agreed to their introduction of the cheap Woodbine brand in 1888. These innovations proved to be immensely successful and made all the members of the Wills family extremely wealthy.<br>
<br>In 1900&#150;01 Wills took a leading part in the &#145;combine&#146; promoted by British tobacco manufacturers to combat the threat to their market share posed by the American Tobacco Company. The resulting new firm was called the Imperial Tobacco Company, and in 1901, at a cost of &pound;11,957,000, it acquired the business of the thirteen major tobacco manufacturing concerns in the United Kingdom. The Wills family, given the size of W. D. and H. O. Wills, subsequently received 60 per cent of the profits of the new company. William Henry Wills served as its chairman until his death.<br>
<br>Wills was a prominent member of the Liberal Party in Bristol and was president of the Anchor Society in 1866. He entered parliament in 1880 as a member for Coventry, representing that borough until 1885, when it lost one of its members. After contesting South-East Essex twice unsuccessfully, first in 1885 and then as an advocate of home rule in 1886, he also failed in South Bristol in 1892, but he was returned at a by-election in March 1895 for East Bristol, and he represented that constituency until his retirement in 1900. He was created a baronet on 12 August 1893, on Gladstone's recommendation, being the first of his family to receive a titular honour, although baronetcies were also soon bestowed on two first cousins and business colleagues.<br>
<br>Closely identifying himself with local interests, Wills was for some years on the council of the Bristol chamber of commerce and in 1863 became its chairman. From 1862 to 1880 he served on the municipal council, was chosen one of the charity trustees in 1865, and was high sheriff of the city in 1877&#150;8. To the public institutions of Bristol he was a notable benefactor. He provided organs for Colston Hall and Bristol grammar school. The Bristol Art Gallery and the St George branch of the Bristol public libraries were built at his expense; and he erected on St Augustine's Parade a statue of Edmund Burke, which was unveiled by Lord Rosebery on 30 October 1894.<br>
<br>Like other members of his family Wills was interested in the University of Bristol, which was incorporated in 1909, and his gifts to it amounted to &pound;35,000. He was appointed pro-chancellor. On 5 July 1904 he was made an honorary freeman of Bristol. In London, where he had a residence in Hyde Park Gardens, he was well known as a director of the Great Western Railway and of the Phoenix Assurance companies and was chairman of the Provincial Companies Association.<br>
<br>A zealous Congregationalist by personal conviction as well as by family tradition, Wills actively engaged in the affairs of the free churches. He joined the board of the dissenting deputies, was a trustee of the Memorial Hall in London, and took a practical interest in the refoundation of Mansfield College at Oxford in 1886. To the new chapel of Mill Hill School, opened in June 1898, he gave an organ and other substantial help.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1906 Wills was raised to the peerage on Campbell-Bannerman's nomination as Baron Winterstoke of Blagdon, Somerset. His country seat Coombe Lodge was at Blagdon. There he took a deep interest in agriculture and was a well-known exhibitor of shire horses and shorthorn cattle. He was deputy lieutenant of Somerset, and high sheriff of the county in 1905&#150;6.<br>
<br>Winterstoke died suddenly at Coombe Lodge on 29 January 1911, and was buried in the churchyard at Blagdon. The peerage became extinct at his death. He left a fortune of almost &pound;2.5 million.<br>
