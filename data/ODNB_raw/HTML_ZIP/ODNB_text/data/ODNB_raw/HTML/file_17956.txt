<span class="headword">Manners,  John</span>, eighth earl of Rutland  (1604&#150;1679), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at Aylestone, Leicestershire, on 10 June 1604, was the eldest son of Sir George Manners (<i>d</i>. 1623) of Nether Haddon, Derbyshire, and Grace, daughter of Sir Henry Pierrepoint of Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire. A great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17963/', "Thomas Manners, first earl of Rutland and thirteenth Baron Ros (d. 1543)")</script>, at the time of his birth there was little apparent likelihood of his succeeding to the earldom. He was admitted a fellow-commoner at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1618, graduated MA in 1621, and entered the Inner Temple in November of that year. In October 1622 Manners obtained a licence to travel abroad for three years. He succeeded to the Haddon estate on the death of his father in 1623 and in 1628 married Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1613, <i>d</i>. 1671), the daughter of Edward Montagu, Baron Montagu of Boughton, and Frances, daughter of Thomas Cotton of Conington, Huntingdonshire. He represented Derbyshire in the parliament of 1626 and in the Short Parliament of 1640, having also served as sheriff of the county in 1632&#150;3. Manners succeeded to the earldom of Rutland on 29 March 1641 on the death of his cousin George, the seventh earl.<br>
<br>In March 1642 Rutland was made lord lieutenant of Derbyshire by parliamentary ordinance and was among those peers who remained at Westminster when parliament was summoned to Oxford by the king in January 1643. He was a moderate, or more accurately lukewarm, parliamentarian; Sir Griffin Markham wrote in 1644 &#145;I doubt not but Rutland will do anything to keep himself afoot, his nature goeth more that way than the right way&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644</i>, 47). He was appointed a commissioner for parliament to Scotland on 13 July 1643 and nominated as a commissioner for the great seal, but excused himself from both charges on the grounds of ill health. Belvoir Castle was taken by the royalists early in 1643 and retaken by parliamentarian forces in 1646. In that year Rutland was again appointed commissioner to Scotland for parliament and the following year chief justice in eyre north of the Trent. He and his growing family had occupied Exeter House on the Strand since 1642 and its chapel became one of the principal centres for the celebration of ceremonial religion until the Restoration. In April 1645 it was reported that the bishop of Durham &#145;had sprinkled Rutland's child, signing her with the sign of the cross&#146;  (Nichols, 53). In 1647 Rutland returned to his Derbyshire estate to find it occupied by local lead miners claiming the historic right of free mining. The Manners family had long opposed the claims of the miners and Rutland responded by leading an armed attack against them. A protracted dispute ensued. The miners, with encouragement from the Levellers, sought to assert their right through the local duchy court; Rutland enlisted the support of the common law and Westminster courts, the parliament, the county gentry, the council of state, and the army in securing his hold over his estate. Not surprisingly he triumphed and a series of legal rulings in 1648&#150;9 declared against the miners' claim.<br>
<br>In May 1649 the council of state, much to Rutland's dismay, ordered that Belvoir Castle should be demolished to prevent any danger of its becoming a royalist base. He subsequently received &pound;1500 compensation. He played little part in the administration of the 1650s, although he retained his position as chief justice in eyre until 1661 when his petition to remain in the office was unsuccessful. The 1660s were dominated by the rebuilding of Belvoir Castle, completed in 1668, and the marital troubles of his son and heir <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17957/', "John Manners, first duke of Rutland (1638&#150;1711)")</script>. Rutland's political rehabilitation was marked by his appointment as lord lieutenant of Leicestershire in 1667, a position he held for a decade before giving way to his son. His wife, Frances, died in May 1671 and all but one of their four sons died in childhood, but six of their seven daughters lived to adulthood and married. Rutland died at Nether Haddon on 29 September 1679 and was buried on 24 October at Bottesford, Leicestershire, the traditional resting place of the earls of Rutland.<br>
