<span class="headword">Frankel,  (Sally) Herbert</span>  (1903&#150;1996), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 22 November 1903 at Carlton Terrace, Johannesburg, Transvaal Colony, the first of three children of Jacob Frankel (1866&#150;1930) and his wife, Mathilde, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Buxbaum (1876&#150;1960). His parents, both Orthodox Jews, were born in Germany; his father emigrated to South Africa in 1896 and worked in the grain trade. Frankel went first to the Deutsche Schule and then to St John's College, Johannesburg. Despite achieving only a third class in his school-leaving exam he was able to enter the University of the Witwatersrand, and there flourished, moving with distinction from a BA honours in economics to an MA. His MA dissertation was published in London as <span class="italic">Cooperation and Competition in the Marketing of Maize in South Africa</span> (1926).<br>
<br>In 1923 Frankel began attending lectures at the London School of Economics, and later enrolled there for a PhD on railway freight rates, a topic he had started to investigate at the request of the Transvaal chamber of mines. The dissertation was successfully submitted in 1927 and published as <span class="italic">The Railway Policy of South Africa</span> (1928). This study, like the one on maize, was notable for its painstaking attention to detail, and the strength, directness, and clarity of its criticisms of government policies exercised through monopolistic agencies without regard to the true economic costs. The hostility to government intervention in economic matters expressed in these early studies was to remain a distinctive feature of Frankel's thinking throughout his life. While in London, Frankel visited his relatives in Frankfurt and met his cousin, Ilse Jeanette Frankel. They were married in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 19 June 1928. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1930 Frankel was appointed to the chair of economics and economic history at the University of the Witwatersrand. His publications during his remaining years in South Africa included a major investigation of the role of capital in the economic development of Africa, <span class="italic">Capital Investment in Africa: its Course and Effects</span> (1938), and a pioneering study of the national income of South Africa since 1918. He served on many official inquiries, and was very active as a personal economic adviser to Sir Ernest Oppenheimer. He also had a close and long-standing relationship with Jan Hofmeyer, and advised him when he was minister of finance during the Second World War. Frankel's deep commitment to free market economics and his lifelong opposition to racial discrimination were expressed in his contribution to a liberal manifesto, <span class="italic">Coming of Age</span> (1930), with contributions also by Hofmeyr, Edgar H. Brookes, and others. Although too radical to be acceptable to the vast majority of white South Africans, the policies advocated were seen by many Africans as offering only a token advance, especially on the crucial issue of the franchise.<br>
<br>In 1945 Frankel was invited to take up a new chair of colonial economic affairs, established at Oxford to further the training of colonial service officers. He immediately informed Hofmeyr, hoping with all his heart that he would be told, &#145;Don't go, there's a job for you here, I've work for you here.&#146; But Hofmeyr made no such response and Frankel accepted the Oxford offer (Frankel, 185; endorsing the account by Alan Paton, <span class="italic">Hofmeyr</span>, 1964, 256). He took up the chair and an associated fellowship at Nuffield College in 1946, and held this until retirement in 1971, though the title was twice changed, finally becoming the chair of the economics of underdeveloped countries. Frankel's strongly expressed free market convictions were no more popular in his new community than they had been in South Africa, and this, together with his strong distaste for abstraction and theory, left him somewhat isolated from the mainstream of British economics. He preferred more practical work leading to advice for governments, even when he knew that it was unlikely to be accepted. He served on numerous committees and commissions, including a working party on the east African groundnut scheme (what better example could there be of the folly of government intervention?), and the royal commission on east Africa (1953&#150;5). His inaugural lecture, and some of his main essays and articles from his early period in Oxford&#151;all more general and reflective than his pre-war studies&#151;were published in 1953 as <span class="italic">The Economic Impact on Under-Developed Societies</span>.<br>
<br>Frankel was a man of great charm and many friendships. He found congenial company among fellow liberals in the Mont Pelerin Society formed under the leadership of F. A. Hayek, and was twice elected a vice-president. He served as president of the Oxford Jewish congregation, and from 1971 to 1989 was first chairman of governors of the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies. He travelled widely in Africa, the United States, and Israel, and from 1967 to 1974 was regularly a visiting professor at the University of Virginia.<br>
<br>Frankel died at his home, 62 Cutteslowe House, Park Close, Oxford, on 11 December 1996. He was survived by his son and daughter, his wife, Ilse, having predeceased him in 1994.<br>
