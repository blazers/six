<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Raistrick,  Arthur</span>  (1896&#150;1991), <span class="occ">industrial archaeologist and pacifist</span>, was born in Saltaire, Yorkshire, on 16 August 1896, the son of George Raistrick, engineer, and his wife, Minnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bell. This model industrial village had been built by manufacturer Titus Salt, in whose mill Arthur Raistrick's mother and several aunts and uncles were employed. His father was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), formed in nearby Bradford in 1892. His four grandparents came from four different Yorkshire dales, their families involved in farming and lead mining. School holidays were spent visiting relatives in the dales, walking as far as Swaledale, some 50 miles away, sleeping in barns on the longer trips. This was his inheritance&#151;socialist&#150;pacifist, walker (he never had a car), and lover of the Pennine landscapes.<br>
<br>From Drummond Road elementary school in Shipley, he won a scholarship to Bradford grammar school. He left at the age of sixteen to become an engineering apprentice, continuing his education at evening classes. Passionately devoted to music, he played the organ in the local Wesleyan chapel. In 1915 he abandoned his work and study to travel with an uncle through the north of England, speaking at pacifist meetings. Refusing to do military service, he spent nearly three years in prison, in Wormwood Scrubs and Durham. His pacifism was rooted in the anti-war stance of the ILP, but some of his fellow prisoners were Quakers, and he joined the Society of Friends in 1919.<br>
<br>Released from prison in September 1919, Raistrick took up a scholarship at Leeds University which he had gained while an apprentice, and graduated in civil engineering. He stayed on to complete an MSc, followed by a PhD in geology, specializing in the composition of coal seams. His record as a conscientious objector was not helpful in the search for employment, and for a few years he survived on research grants, contract work for the Coal Mine Owners' Association and the modest rewards of teaching adult classes for the Workers' Educational Association (WEA). In 1929 he was appointed lecturer in applied geology at Armstrong (later King's) College, Newcastle, and was able on 17 April in the following year to marry fellow scholar (Sarah) Elizabeth Chapman (1891/2&#150;1973). In addition to their home in Newcastle, the couple kept a cottage, later replaced by a house converted from a barn, in the Wharfedale village of Linton.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s the Raistricks planned to go as Quaker missionaries to China, but the sudden death of Arthur's father caused the trip to be cancelled. If Arthur Raistrick rarely travelled far physically&#151;he would never have thought of holidaying away from the Pennines&#151;his intellectual journeys went far beyond the range of most scholars. Five of his first seven published papers (1925&#150;7) were on aspects of glaciation. His expertise in coalmining broadened into a general involvement in the history of technology, especially lead mining and smelting and ironworking. Glaciation led him to an interest in field archaeology, and he combined this with the history of technology to produce industrial archaeology, which he practised long before the term came into general use in the 1950s. He had published in all the above areas by 1929. Later he moved sideways again, into social history, with studies of the south Yorkshire ironmasters and the (Quaker) London Lead Company, the latter published as <span class="italic">Two Centuries of Industrial Welfare</span> (1938).<br>
<br>By that time another war was in prospect, and Raistrick helped to found the Pacifist Advisory Bureau. In 1939 he refused to add his name to a government register of engineering specialists whose skills might be used in the war effort, with the consequence, in his own words, that King's College &#145;just had to suspend me&#146;&#151;without pay  (Joy, 13). He spent the war years at Linton, living partly off the produce of a small plot of land there, and taking WEA classes. For the benefit of WEA students he wrote <span class="italic">Teach yourself Geology</span> (1943). He normally had such readers, rather than academic specialists in mind when he wrote. He supplied many articles to the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Dalesman</span> on such topics as vernacular architecture, drystone walls, and green roads. He was the exact opposite of the kind of historian who researches the lives of people in the past without having the slightest interest in their counterparts in the present. During the depression of the early 1930s, for example, he toured the stricken south Wales coalfield, speaking at miners' welfare clubs and visiting camps for the unemployed.<br>
<br>After holding a fellowship at Woodbrooke, a Quaker college, in 1945&#150;6, Raistrick was invited to return to King's College. His prolific output, including <span class="italic">Quakers in Science and Industry</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">Dynasty of Iron Founders: the Darbys and Coalbrookdale</span> (1953), led to his promotion to reader in 1954. He retired in 1956 to devote himself to activities in the Yorkshire dales, including membership of the national parks committee and his adult education work.<br>
<br>Raistrick conducted regular evening classes for the WEA and Leeds University extramural department until he was well into his seventies. In addition he taught for the local adult schools (an educational movement with a Quaker flavour) and at residential centres including the West Riding Adult College at Grantley Hall and the Malham Tarn field centre. For the WEA he conducted linked weekend courses in youth hostels, a successful attempt to attract young workers into adult education. He aimed to turn curiosity into scholarship by encouraging his students to be active in fieldwork and careful in recording, and especially to use their eyes in reading the landscape as a historical document.<br>
<br>Raistrick's other activities were all of a piece with his research and teaching. He served as president of both the Holiday Fellowship and the Ramblers' Association, and was active in the campaign for wider access to moorland. He gave much attention to national parks, especially the two in Yorkshire. He edited and co-wrote the guide to the North York Moors Park. His involvement with the Society of Friends lasted for over seventy years, and he served for a time as clerk to the Settle monthly meeting.<br>
<br>Raistrick continued to publish on a broad front. In 1965, for example, his works included four pieces in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Archaeological Journal</span> reporting on thirteen archaeological sites in Airedale and Wharfedale; <span class="italic">Vikings, Angles and Danes in Yorkshire</span>; <span class="italic">The Coalbrookdale Company, 1709&#150;1959</span>; and, with B. Jennings, <span class="italic">A History of Lead Mining in the Pennines</span>. The publications of his seventies would have represented a respectable career achievement for most academics. They included three books deriving from his lifelong interest in the landscape as a record, <span class="italic">Old Yorkshire Dales</span> (1967), <span class="italic">The Pennine Dales</span> (1968), and a volume in the <span class="roman">Making of the English Landscape</span> series, <span class="italic">The West Riding of Yorkshire</span> (1970). One of his most important books is <span class="italic">Industrial Archaeology</span> (1972), designed to encourage &#145;a balanced investigation of industry from pre-Roman times to the present&#146;, instead of what he saw as an obsession with measuring textile mills. It was as well that he was so busy, as in 1973 his wife Elizabeth died, at the age of eighty-one.<br>
<br>As Raistrick was a broadbrush writer, in several disciplines, publishing over a period of sixty years, it is inevitable that some of his works have been, and others will be, overtaken by, for example, progress in archaeological techniques and in the range of sources used for local history. However, a book such as <span class="italic">The Pennine Dales</span> could survive periodic updating without the distinctive Raistrick quality being diminished. It is doubtful if anyone will ever match his combination of technical, economic, and social knowledge of the lead mining industry.<br>
<br>Raistrick received many honours, including medals and awards from the Geological Society and the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Leeds (1972) and Bradford (1974). The chancellor of Bradford was Harold Wilson, and after the Labour leader had won the general election of October 1974, he offered an OBE to Raistrick. The latter responded:<blockquote>As a lifelong member of the Independent Labour Party I have frequently spoken against the system of the honours list. I feel that I cannot at this time break my principles and accept the prime minister's suggestion. My thanks for the thought so expressed are no less sincere and I shall value this gesture more than I could value the honour itself. (Correspondence in family possession)</blockquote>A few days later Wilson wrote a friendly personal letter, regretting but respecting Raistrick's decision.<br>
<br>Throughout his life, Raistrick drew spiritual strength as well as intellectual stimulus from the Pennine hills, where &#145;quiet and healing solitude &hellip; refreshment of body, mind and spirit &hellip; can be found after the exertion of the climb&#146;  (Joy, 154). The hills inspired some of his finest writing, as in this description of the view from Cross Fell at sunset:<blockquote>In the evening light the western edge of the long ridge, of which Cross Fell is the highest part, seems to plunge down at a fearful rate into the vale of Eden more than two thousand feet below, while far across the vale the Lake District mountains stand in glorious silhouette against the sunset sky. To the north, still more lightly sketched in, are the outlines of the Solway Firth, on rare occasions glowing like burnished gold under the last rays of the sun &hellip; To the east a wide extent of dusky moorlands steadily declines in broad ridges between shadow-filled valleys, until both are lost in the distance. (A. Raistrick, <span class="italic">The Pennine Dales</span>, 1972, 15)</blockquote>Raistrick died in a nursing home at Skipton, Yorkshire, on 9 April 1991.<br>
