<span class="headword">Cooper,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1800&#150;1836), <span class="occ">printmaker</span>, flourished in the first part of the nineteenth century, but nothing is known of his parentage, early life, or training. Although he did design a few of his own prints, he was primarily a reproductive engraver of portraits who worked variously in stipple and line engraving as well as in etching. Given the early nineteenth-century fashion for collecting historical portraits, he found much employment contributing prints to illustrated antiquarian publications such as Edmund Lodge's <span class="italic">Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great Britain</span> (1821&#150;34) and Henry Tresham's and William Young Ottley's <span class="italic">British Gallery of Pictures</span> (1808&#150;18). While most of these modest historical portraits are formulaic in pose and handling, Cooper was able to provide a level of novelty by employing various engraving techniques such as the delicate stipple effect that can be seen in his series of plates for Sir Robert Naunton's <span class="italic">Fragmenta regalia</span> (1824), an anecdotal account of the court of Queen Elizabeth. His plates also embellished the pages of luxury editions of more light-hearted reading material: they can be found in copies of Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Old Mortality</span>, the fashionable periodical <span class="italic">La Belle Assembl&eacute;e</span>, and the picturesque <span class="italic">Scenery of the Rivers of Norfolk</span> (1834), after paintings by James Stark. Apart from working to order for publishers, Cooper also executed a number of privately issued plates for the duke of Buckingham, all of which were portraits after artists such as Van Dyck and Vel&aacute;zquez apart from the portrait of the duke of Buckingham himself, which was taken from a modern work by George Lethbridge Saunders. His best-known work for this patron is surely his version of the Chandos portrait of Shakespeare, a subject which was in keeping with Cooper's preference for portraits of contemporary actors and actresses, which were eventually published as a series of hand-coloured etchings entitled <span class="italic">British Theatrical Gallery</span> (1822&#150;5).<br>
<br>Although it is not clear when, it seems that Cooper also went into business as a picture dealer and publisher. However, judging from Southgate's auction of his stock of prints and the sale of his &#145;capital mahogany press&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue</span>) between 31 October and 2 November 1826, it would appear that he was unsuccessful in this venture. Somewhat unscrupulously, this sale also included many impressions from the private plates Cooper had executed, as well as &#145;reworkings of subjects popularized by other artists&#146;  (ibid.), such as West's <span class="italic">Death of Wolfe</span> and an unfinished large engraving of <span class="italic">Christ Bearing the Cross</span>, after Mignard. He is known to have shown work at the Associated Engravers' exhibition in 1821, and is thought to have still been living in 1836.<br>
