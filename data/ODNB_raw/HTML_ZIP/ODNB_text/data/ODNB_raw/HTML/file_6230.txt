<span class="headword">Cooper <span class="st"> [Cowper]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1569/70, <em>d.</em> in or after 1626), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer on witchcraft</span>, was born in London and attended Westminster School, apparently with help from the Fishmongers' and Skinners' companies. On 17 December 1586, aged sixteen, he matriculated as a queen's scholar from Christ Church, Oxford, graduating BA on 14 December 1590, and proceeding MA on 19 June 1593 and BD on 14 April 1600. Soon afterwards he was appointed by the mayor and corporation of the city of Chester, probably as a lecturer, to replace William Harrison, recently selected as one of the queen's preachers for Lancashire. On 1 August 1601, on presentation of the dean and chapter of Christ Church Cathedral, Cooper was admitted as vicar of Great Budworth, Cheshire, remaining until 1604; on 8 May he became vicar of Holy Trinity, Coventry. On 28 November 1605 the mayor and Lord Harington wrote from the city to Robert Cecil concerning &#145;Mr Cowper a minister, who stated in a sermon that the papists had contrived nine plots against the King and state&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1603&#150;10</i>, 263). Cooper repeatedly drew attention to God's deliverance of the nation from the Gunpowder Plot. In his first treatment of this theme, <span class="italic">A Brand Taken Out of the Fire, or, The Romish Spider &hellip;, with his Webbe of Treason</span> (1606), there appeared dedications to Lady Harington, to Princess Elizabeth (then in the care of Lord and Lady Harington), and to the Coventry authorities. Relations with the city fathers appear to have soured, for later Cecil was in receipt of another missive from Coventry, this time from Cooper, claiming that for three years his sermons there had remained unpaid. He signed <span class="italic">The Converts First Love Discerned</span> (1610) from &#145;my poor house at Coventry, this 10 April 1610&#146;, but had resigned by the year's end.<br>
<br>It seems probable that soon afterwards Cooper moved to London, for <span class="italic">The Estates of the Hypocrite and Sincere Christian</span> (1613) and later works were dedicated to city people or institutions. In the preface to <span class="italic">A Familiar Treatise, Laying Down Cases of Conscience</span> (1615) the dedicatees, Lady Rumney, Mr Springham, Mr Slaney, Mr Parkhurst, Mr Clarke, Mr Vincent, Mr Mosley, and Mr Thaire, were among Cooper's &#145;Christian auditors and loving neighbours&#146; and &#145;the instrument of my settling in the Citie, and exercise of my calling&#146;. In 1615 also appeared <span class="italic">The Blessing of Japheth</span>, dedicated to Sir Thomas Hayes, mayor of London, the aldermen and sheriffs, and the commissioners for plantations in Ireland and Virginia. There followed <span class="italic">The Mysterie of the Holy Government of our Affections</span> (1619), addressed to &#145;Sir Thomas Smith, most worthie governor of the East Indian Company&#146; and his colleagues. Here as elsewhere Cooper makes plain that for him the material and spiritual ends of trade and colonization meshed perfectly. He acted for another company, the Grocers', in supplying two visitation sermons, published in 1619, at the free school at Oundle, Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>In 1617 Cooper issued <span class="italic">The Mystery of Witch-Craft</span>, the book for which he is chiefly known. Against those who saw in astrology a key to the orderliness of the world, he argued on their own scientific terrain: &#145;The rules of this art have no foundation in experience&#146;  (Thomas, 418). But God was the great architect of order; his providence, together with the efforts of Satan, lay behind the unexpected events which sometimes disrupted the world. Cooper rejected the purveyors of traditional magic, the &#145;good&#146; witches and cunning men of rural England, who sought to achieve results directly by spells and divinations, and thus to assume among the common people the authority of God. He was convinced, however, of the real existence of witchcraft and, like other Calvinists of the new generation, he accepted the widespread European view that witches had made a pact with the devil. Earlier, while at Great Budworth, he had been involved in a case in which a Northwich child had been &#145;afflicted by the power of sathan, and (as it was conceived) through the confederacie of some witches thereabout&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Mystery of Witch-Craft</span>, A3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The cry and revenge of blood: expressing the nature and haynousnesse of wilfull murther &hellip; committed at Halsworth in high Suffolk</span> (1620) appears a remarkable woodcut depicting the exhumation of bodies and the murderer at work with a large cudgel, urged on by a black, satanic figure, horned and taloned, with wings like those of a bat. Cooper attended the trial at Bury assizes, and the book was based on his notes (a representation of the hanging appears at page 59). A preface to Lord Chief Justice Henry Montagu recalled his &#145;gratious clemency in releasing a poor distressed neighbour, at my request&#146; who had &#145;provoked your honour's just displeasure&#146;; the work was signed from &#145;my house in Whitecrosse street&#146;, London, on 24 August 1620.<br>
<br>After 1622, when he issued <span class="italic">The Wonderful Mysterie of Spiritual Growth</span>, dedicated to Lionel Cranfield, the flow of Cooper's publications abruptly ceased. Despite all the great names which had appeared in his works, there can be no doubt that the author was the Thomas Cooper, bachelor in divinity, who, having been appointed a preacher to the fleet by Captain Richard Gyffard, was, in September 1626, in the embarrassing position of having to petition the duke of Buckingham for an advance on his wages (&pound;5 a month) for transport to Portsmouth. After this nothing is known of him.<br>
