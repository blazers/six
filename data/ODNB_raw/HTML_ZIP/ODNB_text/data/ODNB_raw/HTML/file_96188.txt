<span class="headword">Brunt,  Peter Astbury</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">ancient historian</span>, was born on 23 June 1917, at 16 Highfield Road, Coulsdon, Surrey, the only child of Samuel Brunt, Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Gladys Eileen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blewett. He was educated at Ipswich School, and won an open scholarship in history to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1935. In the event he switched to classics, gaining a first in classical moderations and in <i>literae humaniores</i>, after a formal viva. By then, if not earlier, any trace of religious belief had disappeared. It was never as far as is known a subject of conversation between him and his mother, although almost everything else from his childhood onwards was: his mother was a frequent visitor to the house he bought in Oxford in 1970, first from the south coast, then from her own sheltered flat in Oxford.<br>
<br>Frail in health as a child, Brunt was not fit for military service in 1939, and served instead in the Ministry of Shipping. He believed to the end of his life that his generation of Oxford students had been traduced by the public misunderstanding of the &#145;king and country&#146; debate: the public ignored the subsequent vote of the Oxford Union to fight over the German occupation of the Sudetenland, and never understood that the first vote had not been a vote either against country or for tyranny. Reflecting later on his wartime service, he recalled with emotion the patriotism of shipowners who insisted that their best ships were taken, despite knowing that the compensation if they were sunk would not be in full. His time at the Ministry of Shipping also created a lifelong friendship with Derek Allen, allowed him to observe the beginnings of the cold war, with the conspiratorial obstructiveness of Russian delegates to meetings either side of the end of the war, and made it clear to him that he had substantial administrative gifts, to be deployed later in his career.<br>
<br>In 1946 Brunt took up a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, and the Craven fellowship that had been awarded to him in 1939, choosing as a topic for research the relations between governed and governors in the Roman empire, and set off for the British School at Rome. Some of his later interest in Roman stoicism derived from that period, but his stay in Rome did not inspire him with a concern for the iconographic or archaeological sources for Roman history: archaeological evidence either told you something you knew already or was not to be believed. He was appointed to a lectureship at St Andrews in 1947, but succeeded in returning to Oxford in 1951, to Oriel, his former college, as fellow and tutor in ancient history in succession to M. N. Tod. He had by that time read, in the original Greek or Latin and in chronological order, all the major sources for Greek and Roman history, in preparation for a career as a teacher of ancient history: he stopped with Julian, on his appointment to Oxford, on the grounds that he would never need to teach any later period. It was also while he was at St Andrews that he formed a close friendship with one of his students that did not in the end lead to their marriage; the student in due course moved to America, and did marry, but she and Brunt remained close, with intermittent meetings. He never contemplated marriage thereafter, her photograph remaining on his bookcase to the end.<br>
<br>Brunt claimed later that his published work arose out of teaching; but it certainly did not arise out of the ritualistic puzzle-solving that constituted much teaching of ancient history at Oxford during his period as tutor. He clearly rejected from the start, given his initial topic for research, the widely held view that the history of the ancient world is essentially the history of its governing class; and he set out to try to understand the ancient world as a whole, beginning with its economic and demographic structure. Hence his admiration both for A. H. M. (Hugo) Jones, whom he got to know when Jones simply knocked on his door one day, and Moses Finley. His style, however, was not that of either man, lacking both the effortless, often descriptive, lucidity of the former and the off-the-cuff epigrammatism of the latter.<br>
<br>Brunt read and made notes on an astonishing range of material, both ancient and modern; and although some of his published work consisted of a snappy demonstration that current views of parts of Alexander's army or of the chronology of Cicero's letters were most unlikely to be right, his more substantial pieces are shot through with a sense of the obscurity and difficulty of his subject. Part of the reason for this is that he not only insisted on analysing every level of ancient society, but also saw the importance of philosophy, law, politics, and rhetoric. One of the themes that occupied him during the period from 1951 to 1968 was that of ancient slavery: some of his work issued in a devastating review of William L. Westermann's <span class="italic">Slave Systems</span> (1955); but more of it flowed into the project that increasingly occupied his time and his attention, the demography of Roman Italy and of the Roman world in general.<br>
<br>Despite the publication in 1962 of one of the most important articles on Roman republican history of the second half of the twentieth century, on the army and the land in the revolution that replaced the Roman republic with an empire, Brunt assumed that the Camden chair of ancient history would go to A. N. Sherwin-White, not him. Partly because of this, partly to get more time for writing, he became in 1968 bursar of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, which promised a professorial salary and time for research. In fact, he was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1969, and when the time came Hugo Jones insisted that the electors receive an application for the Camden chair from Brunt, the electors were given the page proofs of <span class="italic">Italian Manpower</span>, and the election was made. The book appeared in 1971, the year after he took up the chair, forming the most sustained attempt ever made to argue for the view that the Emperor Augustus changed the basis of the Roman census, and that up to that point the figures represented adult males, thereafter men, women, and (some) children. A rather different work was <span class="italic">Social Conflicts in the Roman Republic</span>, written at the instance of Moses Finley and also published in 1971: it was at the time and for many years remained the best introductory account of the Roman republic. It was also at Finley's behest that Brunt took over from him as chair of the ancient history committee of the Joint Association of Classical Teachers, overseeing the latter's A-level in the subject. His service to the national classics community also included a period as president of the Roman Society and as a member of the council of the British School at Rome.<br>
<br>In the end Brunt was not at ease as Camden professor, disliking particularly the expectation that he should be able to think of topics for research students to work on, and not finding the atmosphere of the graduate seminar congenial. He was not sorry when the cuts in university funding imposed by the government of Margaret Thatcher in 1982 created an opportunity for him to retire, two years early. The years that followed were occupied by collecting for publication, with revisions and additional pieces, his articles on the Roman republic (1988), the Roman empire (1990), and Greece (1992), and by increasingly intensive work on Roman stoicism. The volume of articles on the Roman republic, in particular, contained new material that showed undiminished power, notably a long essay on the fall of the Roman republic that provided the title for the whole volume, and a piece setting out to demolish the importance of client relations for an understanding of Roman republican politics. It is a curious irony, and perhaps a measure of the extent to which the two men had lost contact, that at about the same time Finley was busy arguing that client relations provided the key to understanding Athenian politics.<br>
<br>It was Roman stoicism, however, that claimed more and more of Brunt's attention; this took him into detailed analysis of the fragmentary and difficult evidence for the views of the founders of the school and of Panaetius, perhaps the single most important intermediary between Greek and Roman stoicism. From about 2000 onwards progressively failing physical powers led him to change his plan to write a book about Roman stoicism and collect his earlier articles on the subject with a number of new studies instead. Even this project was in the end defeated; but the undiminished intellectual ambition to try to get something difficult right led him to form plans with his executors for posthumous publication. By this time complaints of physical weakness were all too evidently justified, complaints of loss of memory much less so: to the end, Brunt combined an astonishing knowledge of English literature and British history with a sharply critical view of the politics and the follies of the world around him. In the autumn of 2005 he refused treatment for a cancerous growth in the oesophagus, and died in Sobell House, Oxford, on 5 November 2005.<br>
