<span class="headword">Cottesmore,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1439), <span class="occ">justice</span>, is of unknown origins. He is first recorded in 1403 in Oxfordshire, a county that was the focus for much of his early legal work, culminating in his first appointment to a commission of the peace, for the town of Oxford in 1418. By this time he was a serjeant-at-law. His work now began to expand. In 1420 he was named to commissions of the peace for Cambridge and Cambridgeshire, soon extending to East Anglia and the midland counties, and from this point he was regularly a justice of assize. In 1423 he was created a king's serjeant, and his work as an assize justice and JP expanded further, into the south-west. In 1425 he was among the serjeants summoned to parliament. He was not only employed by the crown. He is recorded as acting for the abbot of Osney and for Edmund Ferrers, fifth Baron Ferrers of Chartley, and was among the lawyers retained by Richard Beauchamp, thirteenth earl of Warwick. From the early 1420s his name begins to appear in the year-books, and later in the discussions of legal issues among justices and senior serjeants in the exchequer chamber, for instance in <i>Thomas Beauchamp's case</i> in 1426.<br>
<br>The development of his career in legal practice and administration evidently brought Cottesmore attention and respect, for on 15 October 1429 he was appointed a justice of common pleas. His elevation was followed by an increase in his nominations to peace commissions and government employment of all kinds, including the collection of taxes, across the whole of central and southern England. In 1437, for instance, he was sent to Norwich with the bishop of Carlisle to oversee the mayoral elections, which the king's council feared would give rise to disorder. Two years later, on 20 January 1439, he was promoted to be chief justice of common pleas, with an annual salary of &pound;93 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. and two robes. But he lived hardly long enough to enjoy his winter robe, for he died on 29 August following. On 14 October his administrators were instructed to deliver all his records to Richard Newton, the new chief justice, and told to meddle no further with them.<br>
<br>Perhaps because his career as chief justice was so brief, Cottesmore left little by way of a judicial legacy, though modern literature on contract law cites his comments on the <span class="roman">Statute of Labourers</span>, on bailment, on tort and contract, and on corporations sole, along with his views on the reception of canon and civil law. Possibly for the same reason he failed to build up much of an estate. His few properties were concentrated in south-east Oxfordshire, where he inherited or acquired the manors of Brightwell Baldwin, Britwell Salome (shortly after 1428) and Little Milton, which was known as Cottesmore manor by 1474. At a date that is unrecorded, but cannot have been later than 1420, he married Amice Bruley, whose family held the manor of Waterstock, a few miles west of Thame. They are represented in two memorial brasses in Brightwell Baldwin church (comparisons make it clear that neither contains portraits). The earlier, presumably from about the time of John's death, is placed in the chancel floor and depicts the couple under canopies, with their eighteen children below. The second, which is set in the north wall of the chancel, shows John and Amice kneeling (the image of the Trinity which was once set between them is now missing). A lengthy Latin verse inscription records that at his death John left Amice with eight children, commenting that there can be no doubt that their marriage was blessed by heaven. It also, and more unusually, comments on his secular career, lauding his concern for justice and for the rights of the church, and the way that &#145;judging civil suits with wondrous power, he was not swayed by love, money, fear or hatred nor by the prayers of the great&#146;  (Norris, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 1.98&#150;9). Following Cottesmore's death his widow married Matthew Hay, but when she died, about 1445, she was buried beside her first husband. The latter's estates descended to his eldest surviving son, another John Cottesmore.<br>
