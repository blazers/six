<span class="headword">Ballard,  Philip Boswood</span>  (1865&#150;1950), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 13 February 1865 at T&#375; Gwyn, Maesteg, Glamorgan, the second of four children of Evan Ballard, grocer, draper, and later manager of a tinplate works, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Philip Cook, a local doctor. Between the ages of five and seventeen, he attended the local British elementary school in Castle Street, Maesteg, under the tutelage of T. L. Roberts, who enjoyed a reputation for being the best schoolmaster in the area. He exerted a major influence upon Ballard's early education. For five years, Ballard was apprenticed to Roberts as a pupil teacher, obtaining a first-class position in the 1883 queen's scholarship examination. In 1884, Ballard entered Borough Road Training College, London, where after two years he was awarded his teacher's certificate, also in the first-class division. In later life, he took an active interest in his old college, meeting regularly for &#145;Old Bs&#146; reunions and serving as chairman of the college committee.<br>
<br>In 1886 Ballard entered the service of the London school board as an assistant master at Settles Street Boys' School in the East End, where he remained for eight years. Teaching in crowded conditions, with classes of upwards of seventy-five boys, all of whom came from poor homes, was a challenging task for a young teacher. Yet he attributed his subsequent career success to the experience of these formative teaching years. In 1888 he enrolled for a part-time degree course at the University of London and, devoting all of his spare time to study, was awarded a first-class BA in 1891. In 1894, his teaching career took a new turn as he became involved with specialized instruction of pupil teachers and was promoted to an assistantship at the Chelsea Pupil Teacher Centre. With five years' experience of working with London pupil teachers behind him, he returned to south Wales as principal of the Tondu Pupil Teacher Centre in Glamorgan, meanwhile studying for his London MA, which he was awarded in 1903. He gained the Carpenter gold medal for mental and moral science.<br>
<br>In 1904 Ballard was appointed as an inspector of elementary schools under Glamorgan county council, but he left south Wales for good in 1906 to begin his long career as an inspector of schools with London county council (LCC). He married, on 27 March 1907, Florence Lucy Stone (<i>b</i>. 1880/81), a schoolmistress, daughter of Thomas Stone, a clerk. On 3 March 1915, then a widower, he married his second wife, Freda Mary (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), daughter of Frederick William Bartlett, an architect. They had one child&#151;a daughter named Mary Bronwen.<br>
<br>Through his work as district inspector of London's elementary schools, Ballard became interested in educational psychology. Along with W. H. Winch, a fellow inspector of the LCC, and other key figures such as Charles Spearman, John Adams, Thomas Percy Nunn, and Cyril Burt, he was one of the leading pioneers of modern educational psychology in the British education system. On the basis of his ground-breaking work, published in 1913 as <span class="italic">Obliviscence and Reminiscence</span>, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by London University. He was inspired by Burt's meritocratic and progressive vision of educational opportunity suited to the intellectual needs of all children, and was responsible for popularizing much of Burt's work on mental testing and for introducing psychology to the LCC education department. He was a founder member of the British Psychological Society and a lifelong member of the editorial board of its journal the <span class="italic">British Journal of Educational Psychology</span>. He was also president of the Child Study Society and took a keen interest in the work of the Child Guidance Council. During the 1930s, working closely with Burt and Spearman, he was a member of the International Institute examinations inquiry which sought to publicize and promote a more scientific and objective approach to public examinations. He lectured widely on mental testing at various prestigious institutions including the London School of Economics, University College, and the London Institute of Education and became well known for his witty and inspiring style.<br>
<br>Ballard's writing for teachers on the subject of testing included a number of successful books of which <span class="italic">Mental Tests</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Group Tests of Intelligence</span> (1922), <span class="italic">The New Examiner</span> (1923), and <span class="italic">The Changing School</span> (1925) were the best-known. They demonstrated his passionate commitment to assisting the practical needs of serving teachers in schools. He firmly believed in the professional right of classroom teachers to advance the knowledge and practice of education and was keen to break down barriers between the academic and the practical in educational psychology.<br>
<br>Ballard's final career promotion, in 1928, was to a divisional inspectorship. He retired from the LCC on 30 April 1930, aged sixty-five. An official LCC report paid tribute to his work: &#145;Few men have had a more important or a more beneficial influence upon the teaching profession, and few inspectors have brought a more cultivated mind or more happy gifts of temperament to their official duties&#146;  (Hughes, 164). Throughout his retirement he continued to keep abreast of educational changes, writing books and making frequent topical contributions to the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>. He had a remarkable capacity for hard work but was above all remembered for his generous and friendly counsel to teachers, his genial personality, and his good sense of humour. Ballard died at his home, Hazel Cottage, Chute, Pewsey, Wiltshire, on 1 November 1950. He was survived by his wife.<br>
