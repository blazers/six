<span class="headword">Walker,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1709&#150;1761), <span class="occ">printer and distributor of patent medicines</span>, details of whose parentage and upbringing remain the subject of speculation, was a prolific entrepreneur in print based in London, who was probably apprenticed through the Stationers' Company. Two entries under this name appear in the registers. The first, a Scot, was apprenticed to a writing master in 1699 and freed in 1706. The second, and more likely candidate, was the son of Thomas Walker, gentleman, deceased, of St Bride's parish in London. This Robert Walker was apprenticed in 1724, presumably at an age close to fourteen, to the City printer James Read, but did not formally complete his term of seven years. Read's interests centred on the publication of his pro-Walpole weekly journal and the sale of patent medicines, while his son Thomas was active in the publication of part-works and cheap newspapers. All these elements figured prominently in the career of Robert Walker. The first imprints to carry his name were published during 1728 and they included a virulent anti-Walpole pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Dunghill and the Oak</span>, printed for Walker and &#145;W. R.&#146;. The initials were undoubtedly those of William Rayner, whose career interlocked with Walker's and who may have had some direct commercial links with him. Between them, Walker and Rayner dominated the trade in the cheaper forms of print into the early 1740s. Walker's appearance on this contentious publication fits with the image of a young man, free of parental control, whose rash and active nature, combined perhaps with financial necessity, were likely to push him into confrontations with authority. His willingness to engage with this material led to his arrest in December 1729, at which time he was described as a pamphlet seller and printer. With his wife he was running a shop at the sign of the White Hart in the Strand adjacent to Devereux Court. The proprietor and distributor of the famous Anodyne Necklace lived on the first floor, while E. Lynn, a whip maker with some interest in publishing, and an unidentified pamphleteer were also on the premises. Walker was taken into custody but made fulsome offers of discovery and was not proceeded against. His unnamed wife figured prominently but, although the details of Walker's family circumstances are obscure, the timing of what is known, checked against the content of his will (1761), may suggest a second marriage in the 1730s. Circumstantial evidence seems to point to a first wife, Elizabeth Hoseley (<i>d</i>. 1731), and a second, Judith (second name unknown), who survived him. Their daughter Judith was baptized at St Sepulchre Church (1738) as were four other children&#151;Anne (1740), Robert (1743), Mary (1745), and Franklin (1749). Samuel Walker was baptized at St Botolph without Bishopsgate in 1750.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Walker's erratic and dynamic career was moving in several directions. He continued to publish potentially libellous pamphlets, and an equivocal disclaimer of responsibility for one of them which he inserted in the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span> in 1731 was supported by an affidavit signed by William Rayner. Party-political material hostile to the administration continued to form an identifiable element within his mixed output as printer and publisher. In 1732 he was again arrested, this time in a sweep of the trade centred on a cluster of anti-Walpole material for which Rayner was arrested and finally imprisoned (1733). It may have been because of the force of this process that Walker moved into another, more directly commercial, area of attack. In 1734 he became embroiled in a flat-out battle over material claimed by Jacob Tonson and associates, high-status members of the respectable London trade, under the shaky notion of perpetual copyright. Walker had apparently moved his main centre of operations to Turnagain Lane, one of the streets embedded in the dense networks of courts and alleys abutting the Fleet market and prison and adjacent to the complex formed by Newgate prison, the Sessions House, and the College of Physicians in the Old Bailey. He remained in this neighbourhood for the rest of his life. From his printing office he began to issue cut-price editions of the plays of Shakespeare and others which were being simultaneously published by the booksellers whom in his advertisements he described as &#145;the monopolists&#146;. Legal proceedings followed but Walker remained in business and may have reached a financial accommodation with his competitors. He continued to confront the claims of the respectable trade and in 1739 and 1752 faced injunctions over his serial publication of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. He remained undaunted. During the skirmishes with Tonson in 1734 Walker worked out of a number of shops under his truculent sign of Shakespeare's Head and his premises at the Royal Exchange and in Fleet Street, among other central locations, figured on his fluctuating imprints. In the mid-1730s he moved his printing office to Fleet Lane, where he consolidated his business and began to develop what were to become his main lines of publication&#151;cheap newspapers and part works. The bibliography of Walker's increasingly voluminous output is bewildering. Non-survival, disguised imprints, multiple and overlapping series in a variety of forms help to obscure the networks of material that flowed through Walker's office and across the nation.<br>
<br>Initially, Walker's publications are hard to distinguish from those of William Rayner and others. However, by 1737 he had begun to publish sequences of cheap newspapers specifically directed at the local market. With their geographical target identified in their titles by county, these publications represented the first attempt to provide cheap serial print specifically for readers outside London. The newspapers formed one part of Walker's marketing strategy. It was combined with the issue of works in parts, some of which used material already in print and often claimed under copyright; others were composed of original material written by authors for whom Walker acted as sole publisher. These serials were sometimes supplementary to the newspapers with which they were issued, sometimes the newspaper simply formed the wrapper for each part. The third element of Walker's output was provided by medical specifics.<br>
<br>From 1739 Walker consolidated his newspaper interest in the <span class="italic">London and Country Journal</span>. Until 1741 this was published in conjunction with the <span class="italic">History of the Bible</span> in parts which was incorporated into the title of the paper. The <span class="italic">Journal</span> appeared in different series published from Fleet Lane on different days of the week and directed at readers in counties extending through the midlands and into the north-west. Walker's interventions in places outside London brought him into a series of conflicts with established local printers such as Thomas Aris in Birmingham. To ensure a foothold in the local market he began from the late 1730s to work directly with printers who moved into several of the main urban centres as his representative. John Berry in Manchester (1738) and Joseph Collett in Bristol (1739) centred their activities on the distribution of Walker's print and medicines, while Walker himself played an occasional part in the conduct of the local business.<br>
<br>By the mid-1740s Walker's business may have needed a new impetus. He had resolved the problems arising out of his attempt to evade the taxes on newspapers, pamphlets, and advertisements and in most local centres agreement seems to have been reached with his main competitors. In 1744 Walker left London with the printers Rene Le Butte and Thomas James to set up a new printing office in Cambridge, from which the first newspaper to appear locally was to be produced. The <span class="italic">Cambridge Journal and Weekly Flying Post</span> proved successful and two years later Walker moved on. In another joint venture, this time with the printer William Jackson, Walker targeted Oxford. In 1746 they opened a printing office and began to publish the <span class="italic">Oxford Flying Weekly Journal</span>. In spite of entrenched university interests, the corporation of the city of Oxford granted Walker the right to hang out his sign at the office and Jackson to do the same at their medical warehouse (1746/7). In 1749 the newspaper ceased publication and Walker, who had also published a number of part works in association with Jackson, probably returned to London. Four years later Jackson set up a new journal under his own name and in 1761 was named as an executor in Walker's will.<br>
<br>Walker continued to run his London printing and publishing business, probably with the help of his wife, who must have taken over during his absences, and to distribute those medicines in which he had a special interest. The Fleet Lane printing office itself or adjacent premises appeared in advertisements as Walker's Daffy's Elixir Warehouse (1738) or the British Oil Warehouse (1748). Walker, like his competitors, made extensive promotional use of royal grants under letters patent. These sometimes applied to original printed material particularly vulnerable to low-level piracy and increasingly to such medicines as the British Oil, which was granted to Walker during the 1740s. His business, like that of most printer&#150;publishers in London and elsewhere, was essentially miscellaneous. His <span class="italic">Journal</span> carried advertisements for prints, songs, shrub (a lemon mixer), as well as his usual cheap print and medicine. Print was always part of a broad spectrum of commercial interests and at the end of the 1740s, although he was still living at his house in the Little Old Bailey, near Fleet Street, his move away from publication may already have begun. In 1752 he issued the serial edition of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, to which Tonson took exception, and announced the trials of Mary Blandy and others. In a notice published in the papers he expressed outrage at those who were already pirating these trials &#145;in the most scandalous and mangled Manner&#146;.<br>
<br>Such remarks suggest a build-up in pressure. Shortly after this Walker fled abroad to avoid his creditors, although by 1755 he had returned and surrendered himself to the keeper of the Fleet prison. In July he claimed benefit of the latest <span class="roman">Act for Insolvent Debtors</span>, describing himself as &#145;formerly of Fleet Lane, late of the Little Old Bailey &hellip; and last of Dunkirk in French Flanders&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 9492, Saturday 12 July 1755). His release was followed in 1756 by a brief flourish of material issued from the Fleet Lane office under the imprint of Judith Walker. He must have found the return to an increasingly active market in print discouraging and from 1755 Walker himself reappears in the exclusive guise of a specialist supplier of a patent medicine called the Jesuit Drops or Elixir of Health and Long Life.<br>
<br>This was one of many specifics for venereal disease and was available under a plain wrapper from Walker's warehouse at the Bible and Crown in Fleet Lane. Walker described himself as the inventor and patentee of the drops and in his advertisements rehearsed his accumulation of grants for its exclusive production and sale&#151;for England and for the Plantations (1755), for Scotland (1756), and for Ireland (1759). He may have kept up the printing office to produce books of direction, handbills, labels, and other necessary items, but his interest in other forms of print was over. His medical business was managed by Joseph Wessells, who was praised in Walker's will for his &#145;capacity in the practice of Physick and Surgery&#146; as well as for his knowledge of Walker's medicines. In 1761 Wessells was earning a salary of 2 guineas a week and was probably responsible for a number of &#145;Common and Necessary Servants&#146; employed in &#145;Bottling, Corking, Tying, Papering &amp;c.&#146;. Walker's established distribution networks extending overseas must have been fully employed. At his death he owned a &pound;150 share in the brig <i>Happy Success</i>, presumably for use in the export trade.<br>
<br>Suddenly, in 1759, his advertisements without comment began to refer to Dr Robert Walker (MD), a title which he insisted on using in all areas of his personal life. Working almost opposite the College of Physicians, his self-identification as doctor of physick may have been a last contemptuous gesture towards the claims of authority. In 1761 Walker was running a &#145;chariot&#146; (hired for health reasons, he claimed) drawn by his own horses and the assumption of the title may also have reflected a rise in his financial status. Much of his long will was taken up with an attempt to ensure the continuation of the medical business, with Joseph Wessells holding the major share. His property and personal effects were to be shared between his wife, Judith, and his three daughters, Judith Burling, Elizabeth Croft, and Anne Walker. He died shortly after making his will, which was proved on 15 September 1761. No notice of his death was placed in the newspapers and advertisements for the Jesuit Drops continued to carry the name and address of &#145;the well-known Robert Walker&#146; long after his demise.<br>
