<span class="headword">Martyn,  Caroline Eliza Derecourt</span>  (1867&#150;1896), <span class="occ">Christian socialist</span>, was born on 3 May 1867 in Manson Street, Lincoln, the eldest of the nine children of James William Martyn, a police superintendent, and his wife, Kate Eleanor (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hewitt) (<i>d</i>. in or after 1896). The Martyns were devout high Anglicans, and active Conservatives. After attending Beaumont House School, Lincoln, Caroline became a governess at the age of eighteen. In common with many other young girls of her class she found this unsatisfying and opted for schoolteaching, first at a church school and then in 1890 at a board school in Reading.<br>
<br>Caroline Martyn's first political involvement was with the Primrose League. This altered during her stay in Reading when she lodged with her mother's sister, Mrs Bailey, a lady of more leftward views. The combination of her influence and a sustained reading of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> made Caroline Martyn increasingly aware of other political ideologies and she flirted briefly with radicalism before committing herself to socialism. In 1891 she moved to London. She went to take up a post as governess at the Royal Orphanage Asylum in Wandsworth, and also to be in a location where she could more fully involve herself in socialism. She joined the London Fabian Society on arrival. The following summer, when a health breakdown forced her to resign her post, she was able to devote herself completely to the socialist cause. She never married.<br>
<br>The religion in which she was raised always remained an important part of Caroline Martyn's political beliefs. She violently opposed the &#145;hard and bitter materialism&#146; of her Marxist contemporaries  (Mayo, <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 226). She relied on <span class="roman">Bible</span> teachings more than revolutionary or economic rhetoric, and &#145;The social teachings of Jesus&#146;, &#145;The brotherhood of man&#146;, and similar titles featured heavily in her lecture list. Religion and socialism constantly intertwined in her work, allowing her politics to surface in unusual places. From the spring of 1893 she wrote regularly for the <span class="italic">Christian Weekly</span> on social questions of the day. However those who knew her well noted that socialism often forced her to compromise some of her religious beliefs. Her friend Isabella Fyvie Mayo sadly commented that Caroline, who always sought to help those in trouble, was often &#145;less than loyal to her own best instincts &hellip; (and showed) apparent approval of some whom I know she despised and mistrusted&#146;  (ibid., 227).<br>
<br>A feminism which stemmed from a belief in the equality of all also underpinned Caroline's political life. As a socialist she rejected a distinct campaign for &#145;women's rights as something separate and apart from all other rights&#146;. She believed instead that men and women should work together to remove the &#145;false social and economic conditions&#146; that oppressed both sexes  (&#145;Women in the world&#146;, <span class="italic">Labour Prophet</span>, July 1895). She believed women were of &#145;different but equal value&#146; from men  (&#145;Women's work and wages&#146;, <span class="italic">Christian Weekly</span>, 23 Sept 1893), and her writings urged women socialists to expand their superior female influence into all spheres of life.<br>
<br>Although she published widely in radical journals it was as a lecturer rather than a writer that Caroline Martyn was best known to her contemporaries. Ironically, despite her teaching background, she initially feared public speaking, and only the encouragement of friends persuaded her into lecturing. This brought her national recognition, and she attracted large audiences whenever she appeared. One Independent Labour Party (ILP) member who often heard her speak claimed that at her meetings:<blockquote>she reaches the mind of the dullest by her simplicity and by her pathos and religious fervour she carries the whole argument upward to the plane of unworldliness and self-sacrifice. She makes the &#145;smart&#146; man of commerce feel mean, and the man whose object is to get on meaner still. The effect of her teaching is to &hellip; enlarge and ennoble the motive and aims of the socialist reformer. (<span class="italic">Labour Chronicle</span>, 1 Aug 1895)</blockquote>Unfortunately the lifestyle of an itinerant speaker did not suit Caroline Martyn's health. She confided her emotional dissatisfaction to friends such as Mrs Mayo on more than one occasion: she missed the stability of a fixed home and felt she was merely a speaking machine. Long journeys by third-class rail, poor sleeping accommodation, and a sense of always having to move on also took their toll physically. Her 1896 election to the ILP's national executive added to her schedule. She died suddenly of pneumonia at 107 Murraygate, Dundee, on 23 July 1896 and was buried the next day in Dundee at Balgay cemetery.<br>
<br>Caroline Martyn's unexpected death at the age of twenty-nine shook the socialist movement. Keir Hardie wrote that she was the leading socialist of her day, with &#145;a power of intellect and moral-force&#146; that was unmatched  (<span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>, 1 Aug 1896). The <span class="italic">Glasgow Commonweal</span>, referring to her work in a recent Aberdeen by-election, remarked that all ILP branches in the area had lost their best member. A subscription in <span class="italic">The Clarion</span> raised money for a mobile propaganda van which bore her name. Added poignancy came from the fact that Caroline Martyn had just taken over the editorship of <span class="italic">Fraternity</span>, the journal of the International Society for the Brotherhood of Man, and was about to commence as trade union organizer among Dundee's women. In many senses it appeared her best work was about to begin.<br>
