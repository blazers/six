<span class="headword">Borthwick,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1581), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the eldest son of the Haddington burgess David Borthwick. A determinant at St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1525, he became a burgess of Haddington in July 1531 and within months was one of the bailies of the burgh. He accompanied James V to France in 1536 in the train of the royal secretary, Sir Thomas Erskine, and was rewarded for his services the following year by being appointed captain of Tantallon Castle, where in 1538 he played host to the king. In 1540 he presented a royal letter to the burgh council requiring it to accept a replacement for Archibald Borthwick, prebendar of the burgh's kirk, who was to remain in the king's service. David's career as an advocate grew during the 1530s, while in the following decade he was appointed by the king's advocate, Henry Lauder, as one of his substitutes to act in his absence on the king's behalf. By 1549 Borthwick was one of the nine leading advocates licensed to act before the college of justice. Links to the earl of Arran in the 1540s brought suspicion of protestant sympathies. In 1554 he, along with others including Adam Borthwick, received a remission for treasonably acting against the governor &#145;<i>super mora de</i> Glasgow&#146;  (Livingstone, 4.2611), presumably with the earl of Lennox when the earl was active against the government in April 1544. However, in 1553 he was appointed to a commission to meet an English delegation in the borders.<br>
<br>Borthwick was retained by Edinburgh town council to act as one of its assessors in 1562 and in the same year he subscribed to raise funds for the building of a new poor hospital within the burgh. During this period he acted as advocate on behalf of the burghs of Aberdeen and Dundee, and also appears to have been advocate for the church. His professional success is reflected in the fact that he was assessed at the highest rate (&pound;100) in Edinburgh council's tax of 1565. In 1573 Borthwick succeeded John Spens as king's advocate and on 20 October became an <i>ex officio</i> lord of session. The following year he accompanied the regent, the earl of Morton, to Aberdeen and served on the commission for framing a constitution for the Church of Scotland. Borthwick acquired considerable estates in Haddington and Berwickshire. In 1540 he was given lands in Berwickshire by the commendator and convent of Kelso, and a decade later he and his wife were made jointly infeft in the lands of Lochhill within the constabulary of Haddington. These were augmented in 1553 and 1557 when Borthwick obtained the lands of Fenton in Haddingtonshire in gifts from the crown.<br>
<br>Borthwick died, a wealthy man, on 30 January 1581, leaving a total estate of &pound;11,576 Scots. He married first, before 1550, Marion Blyth (<i>d</i>. 24 March 1571) and second Marion Guthrie, who was the executor-nominate of his estate. He had at least two sons from these marriages, David, the elder (<i>d</i>. September 1575), and James, and he and Marion Blyth had two daughters, Agnes and Isobel.<br>
