<span class="headword">Cunningham,  Daniel John</span>  (1850&#150;1909), <span class="occ">anatomist</span>, born at the manse of Crieff, in Strathearn, on 15 April 1850, was the youngest son in a family of three sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6926/', "John Cunningham (1819&#150;1893)")</script> and his wife, Susan Porteous (<i>d</i>. 1902), daughter of William Murray, a banker in Crieff and his wife, Susan Porteous, a relative of Captain John Porteous. After education at Crieff Academy Cunningham spent some three years working in a large mercantile business in Glasgow. But his inclination was for medical study, and in 1870 he entered the University of Edinburgh as a medical student whence he graduated in 1874 with the highest honours. For a few months he practised in Glasgow, but he returned in 1876 to become demonstrator of anatomy in the University of Edinburgh, and for a time held, with this post, the chair of physiology in the Edinburgh Veterinary College. In 1882 he became professor of anatomy in the school of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and the next year was appointed professor of anatomy in Trinity College, Dublin. Here, for twenty years, he was the most popular teacher in the university. In 1903 he succeeded Sir William Turner as professor of anatomy in the University of Edinburgh where he worked with enthusiasm and success until his death. He married, in 1878, Elizabeth Cumming, eldest daughter of Andrew Browne, minister of the parish of Beith in Ayrshire; they had two daughters and three sons, the latter including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32665/', "Andrew Browne Cunningham, Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope (1883&#150;1963)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30991/', "Sir Alan Gordon Cunningham (1887&#150;1983)")</script>.<br>
<br>As a lecturer Cunningham had the talent of illuminating scientific subjects by illustrations drawn from every field of science. His enthusiasm and perseverance were contagious, and roused the latent powers of both colleagues and pupils. He published original research in human and comparative anatomy, as well as in anthropology. In addition to numerous papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</span>, of which he was the acting editor, and in other scientific publications, he issued <span class="italic">Report on the Marsupialia Brought Home by H.M.S. Challenger</span> (1878) and <span class="italic">The Dissector's Guide for Students</span> (1879), which subsequently developed into his <span class="italic">Manual of Practical Anatomy</span> (2 vols., 1893&#150;4). The Cunningham Fund, founded in memory of Timothy Cunningham, for the publication of work of special merit connected with the Royal Irish Academy, issued two papers by Cunningham: <span class="italic">On the Lumbar Curve in Man and the Apes</span> (1886) and <span class="italic">On the Surface Anatomy of the Cerebral Hemispheres</span> (1892). To the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the same academy he contributed a &#145;Memoir on Cornelius Magrath, the Irish giant: a research into the connection which exists between giantism and acromegaly&#146; (1891); and to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society</span> a &#145;Memoir on the microcephalic idiot&#146; (1895). He delivered before the Anthropological Institute in 1902 the third Huxley memorial lecture, on &#145;Right-handedness and left-brainedness&#146;, for which he was awarded a memorial medal. In conjunction with Edward Hallaran Bennett he wrote <span class="italic">The Sectional Anatomy of Congenital Caecal Hernia</span> (1888). Of the <span class="italic">Textbook of Anatomy</span>, published in 1902 by the pupils of Sir William Turner, he acted as editor and joint author.<br>
<br>In administrative affairs Cunningham exercised great influence in the councils of the universities and of the learned societies with which he was connected, and he played a significant part in the establishment of postgraduate instruction at Edinburgh. He was a member of the commission to inquire into the management of the sick and wounded in the South African War, of the War Office committee on the standard of candidates and recruits for the army, and of the vice-regal commission on the inland fisheries of Ireland. He was largely responsible for inaugurating the medical department of the Territorial Army in Scotland. Cunningham received many honorary degrees&#151;MD and ScD, Dublin, LLD, St Andrews and Glasgow, and DCL, Oxford, in 1892, on the celebration of the tercentenary of Trinity College, Dublin. He was elected FRS on 4 June 1891, and was president of the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland, and vice-president of the Royal Dublin Society.<br>
<br>Cunningham became ill towards the end of 1908 and journeyed to Egypt, and then the Riviera, in the hope of regaining his health. He died at his home, 18 Grosvenor Crescent, Edinburgh, on 23 June 1909. His funeral service was held at St Cuthbert's parish church before his body was interred in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, on 26 June. A memorial service was held in St Giles's Cathedral on 27 June. He was survived by his wife and children. A memorial bronze bas-relief was placed, in duplicate, on the walls of the anatomical departments of the University of Edinburgh and of the University of Dublin.<br>
