<span class="headword">Ua Briain,  Toirdelbach</span> <span class="st"> [Turlough O'Brien]</span>  (1009&#150;1086), <span class="occ">king of Munster</span>, was the son of Tadc mac Briain, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3377/', "Brian B&#243;ruma")</script>. His mother was M&oacute;r, daughter of Gilla Brigte Ua Ma&iacute;l Muaid (<i>d</i>. 1071), king of Cen&eacute;l Fiachach. The death of Brian B&oacute;ruma in 1014 and the dispute for succession among his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20452/', "Donnchad Mac Briain")</script> and Tadc, weakened the U&iacute; Briain. Donnchad had Tadc, Toirdelbach's father, assassinated in 1023 so as to become king of Munster. His enemy, the dynamic Diarmait mac M&aacute;el na mB&oacute;, emerged as king of Leinster. Diarmait encouraged opposition to Donnchad by supporting his rival and nephew, Toirdelbach. Toirdelbach united Diarmait's hostility to Donnchad with that of &Aacute;ed Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht. Donnchad was caught between Diarmait in the south-east and &Aacute;ed in the north-west. Combined assaults began in the mid-1050s. In 1063 Donnchad succumbed and left on pilgrimage to Rome, where he died. Toirdelbach Ua Briain became king of Munster with Diarmait's backing but his ability in co-ordinating opposition to Donnchad showed he would be more than Diarmait's creature. This explains Diarmait's continued involvement in Munster: capable allies require careful management.<br>
<br>Toirdelbach Ua Briain sought to control Connacht by encouraging competition between the U&iacute; Conchobair and U&iacute; Ruairc. Manipulating these dissensions prepared him for events in Leinster. The death of Diarmait mac M&aacute;el na mB&oacute; in 1072 was unexpected, but Toirdelbach may not have been unprepared, for the king of Leinster was by then an old man. Toirdelbach's direction of events shows the full extent of his considerable strength and ability. He moved quickly and, by promoting rival candidates, fractured the power base Diarmait had created. He consolidated his position in the south by installing his sons Diarmait and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20464/', "Muirchertach Ua Briain")</script> as <i>duces</i> in the viking ports of Waterford and Dublin and made Limerick his capital. By 1075 Ireland south of a line from Dublin in the east to Limerick in the west was firmly under his control. He now turned his attention northward.<br>
<br>Ua Briain extended control over Meath in 1073 following the death of its king, Conchobar Ua M&aacute;el Shechnaill. However, the limits of his power were demonstrated in 1075 when he ventured further north and was defeated by the Airgialla. A more cautious policy was needed. Northern opposition could be contained by encouraging rivalry between the Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain and the Ulaid. The Ulaid had been in alliance with Diarmait mac M&aacute;el na mB&oacute;. It was natural for them to transfer that allegiance to Toirdelbach, his successor as leader in the south. He received Donnsl&eacute;ibe Ua hEochada and &Aacute;ed Mer&aacute;nach Ua hEochada of the Ulaid in Limerick. At this time the Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain promoted Conchobar Ua Briain and, later, his brother Cenn&eacute;tig, grandsons of Donnchad Mac Briain and Toirdelbach's rivals, to their kingship. The presence of these U&iacute; Briain in the north is therefore symptomatic, not of Toirdelbach's power but of the complex web of strategic alliances that was very much a feature of the power structure in Ireland. If Toirdelbach planned on fragmenting the Ulster polity by promoting the Ulaid, the Cen&eacute;l nE&oacute;gain responded by making kings of Toirdelbach's enemies. But despite his capable manipulation of political tensions, Toirdelbach failed in 1079 to recognize the opportunity presented by the arrival of a number of Jews at his court. The purpose of their journey was probably commercial but he chose not to use their capital to finance his ambitions and &#145;they were sent back again over the sea&#146;  (annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 1079).<br>
<br>In 1080 M&aacute;el Shechnaill, king of Meath, submitted to Toirdelbach Ua Briain as security against Donnchad Ua Ruairc of Connacht. In 1084 the Munstermen marched into Meath. Ua Ruairc launched a successful counter-attack into Munster and pushed as far as Leinster. Toirdelbach's son Muirchertach defeated him near Leixlip and brought his severed head to Limerick as a trophy. Cenn&eacute;tig Ua Briain, fighting on Ua Ruairc's side, was among the casualties. Toirdelbach fell ill in the following year and suffered the loss of his hair. He died on 14 July 1086 at Kincora (in what is now Clare) and, despite his failure in the north, the annals of Ulster style him king of Ireland in his obit. The same dignity is accorded him in letters from Pope Gregory VII and Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury, who wanted him to support church reform. The entry in the annals of St Mary's Abbey, Dublin, recording the selection of Donngus (Donatus) as bishop of Dublin in 1085 by Terdylvacus, king of Ireland  (Gilbert, 250), reflects Toirdelbach's controlling interest and also represents the beginnings of the movement for ecclesiastical reform under royal patronage in the south. His title was disputed among his sons Diarmait, Tadc, and Muirchertach. Derbfhorgaill (<i>d</i>. 1098), daughter of Tadc Mac Gilla P&aacute;draig, was mother of Tadc, and of Muirchertach, who succeeded Toirdelbach. Diarmait's mother was Dubchoblaig of the U&iacute; Chennselaig, rulers of Leinster. Gormlaith (<i>d</i>. 1076), daughter of Ua F&oacute;garta of southern &Eacute;ile, is also recorded as one of Toirdelbach's wives.<br>
<br>Toirdelbach Ua Briain's expert reading of the political landscape and quick, decisive reaction to political developments re-established the U&iacute; Briain of D&aacute;l Cais as the dominant dynasty in Ireland. As competition increased and access to power became limited to fewer dynasties, the exploitation of internal rivalry became an important means for powerful men to direct affairs in rival kingdoms. This manipulation of tensions was a constant feature of Toirdelbach's career; he was himself subjected to it and used his enemies' difficulties to good effect.<br>
