<span class="headword">Stephens,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1611&#150;1617), <span class="occ">satirist and playwright</span>, was the son and heir of John Stephens of Gloucester and member of a prolific Gloucester family. He must be distinguished from the John Stephens (<i>d</i>. 1613) who was attorney-general to Henry, prince of Wales, and also from John Stephens of Minsterley, Herefordshire. On 11 November 1611 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, where he practised common law, but he held no office there.<br>
<br>In 1615 Stephens published <span class="italic">Satyrical essayes, characters, and others, or, Accurate and quick descriptions fitted to the life of their subjects</span>. When it went to a second edition in the same year, he added &#145;a new Satyre in defence of Common Law&#146;, and the third edition of 1631 boasted still more &#145;New Essayes and Characters&#146; (the &#145;Essay on a worthy poet&#146; was once, rather unconvincingly, suggested as a portrait of Shakespeare). Stephens wrote to congratulate his friend Henry Fitzgeffrey, also a member of Lincoln's Inn, on the discernment rather than malice which characterized his <span class="italic">Satyres and Satyricall Epigrams</span> (1617), and to commend the fact that they were in English; this, and his presentation of a poet in his sole play, show his conception of the nature and importance of the satirist's role. Another poem to Fitzgeffrey deplores inconstancy, and his tragedy <span class="italic">Cinthia's Revenge, or, Maenanders Extasie</span> (1613) is described in the dedication to &#145;his constant friend, <i>Mr. Io. Dickinson</i>&#146; as a &#145;Modele of Inconstancie&#146;. It was not entered in the Stationers' register, but was published surreptitiously, and in the first instance anonymously, with commendatory verses by F. C., G. Rogers, Tho. Danet, and Ben Jonson. In the play, which owes much to Lucan and Ovid, the goddess Cynthia, resenting the fact that her cult has declined in Sparta and been left the preserve of women, maddens the men. There is no record of performance, which its great length, lack of dramatic interest, and weak versification make unlikely, but it is of some interest for its representation of gender and its exploration of similar themes to <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span> of Beaumont and Fletcher.<br>
