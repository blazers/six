<span class="headword">Canaries,  James</span>  (1653/4&#150;1698), <span class="occ">episcopalian minister</span>, was the son of Thomas Canaries (<i>c</i>.1615&#150;1677), minister of Kinnaird, Perthshire, and his wife, Margaret Leighton. After attending St Andrews University he began trials before the presbytery of Perth in January 1671. His ministerial training ended when he and two other students were allegedly involved in a drunken escapade, after which he is reported to have gone to serve in Dunbarton's regiment in France. In order to train for the Roman Catholic priesthood he entered Douai College on 27 March 1678, aged twenty-four, but, after a period in Rome, left in March 1681 and returned to Scotland.<br>
<br>During 1681&#150;2 Canaries held a bursary in the presbytery of Dunkeld, and taught in that of St Andrews, which admitted him into communion in January 1682, and licensed him to preach on 24 October 1683. In addition to unpublished attacks on Roman Catholicism, in 1684 the ambitious convert proclaimed his renewed protestantism in <span class="italic">A Discourse Representing the Sufficient Manifestation of the Will of God to his Church</span>, a lengthy work dedicated to the chancellor, the earl of Perth. It perhaps helped him to obtain the parish of Selkirk, to which he was licensed in February 1685. Another fulsome dedication to Perth accompanied <span class="italic">A Sermon Preacht at Selkirk upon the 29th of May 1685</span>, in which he celebrated the Restoration and strongly upheld the doctrine of non-resistance. In February 1686 Canaries controversially preached against his erstwhile faith, later claiming that far from stirring up sedition, he espoused loyalty to the crown and the protestant religion, and sought to persuade his hearers to trust King James's assurances to the church. Alexander Cairncross, archbishop of Glasgow, was obliged to suspend him, but was said to have given him &pound;20 towards his journey to London, where the bishop of Ely and others approved his sermon. In 1686 it was printed as <span class="italic">Rome's Additions to Christianity</span>, and he was made DD at St Andrews. Cairncross was deprived for failing to silence him but Canaries's suspension ended in December 1687.<br>
<br>On 30 January 1689 Canaries's <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Edinburgh, in the East Church of St Giles</span>, on the anniversary of Charles I's martyrdom, attacked rebellion against a lawful king, but remarkably proposed that when a ruler acted arbitrarily his subjects might judge his conduct. Although such contractual arguments generally failed to loosen his brethren's allegiance to James VII during the revolution settlement, Canaries duly acknowledged William and Mary as sovereigns. Surviving accusations before the privy council and attacks on his manse during September 1689, he endured the odium of lobbying for the Williamite episcopalians who struggled to secure themselves in their parishes without being subject to presbyterian church government. He officially remained parish minister at Selkirk until October 1691, when the presbytery declared the charge vacant on the grounds of desertion. Canaries had followed William to The Hague early that year, and was appointed his chaplain and clerk of the closet. Despite having access to the king, who desired an accommodation in church government, his vital role in consolidating episcopalian support failed when the general assembly of 1692 refused to receive the majority of episcopalian applicants. In addition to his personal kindness towards Canaries and his wife, Lady Anne Erskine, daughter of the earl of Buchan, the king rewarded the exhausted agent in March 1692 with the vicarage of St Helen's, Abingdon, Berkshire. There he compiled the main text of <span class="italic">The Epitome of Scotch-Presbytery</span> (1692) and clashed with a Quaker parishioner, Oliver Sansom, who recorded their disputes. He died in May 1698; administration of his estate was granted to his widow on 27 May.<br>
