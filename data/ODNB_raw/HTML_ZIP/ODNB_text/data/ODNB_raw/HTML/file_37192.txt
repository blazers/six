<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Billing,  Noel  Pemberton</span>  (1881&#150;1948), <span class="occ">aviator and self-publicist</span>, was born on 31 January 1881 in Hampstead, the youngest child of Charles Eardley Billing, a Birmingham iron-founder, and his wife, Annie Emilia Claridge. He was educated at the high school, Hampstead; Cumming's College, outside Boulogne; Westcliff College, Ramsgate; and Craven College, Highgate. At the age of thirteen Billing stowed away on a ship bound for Delagoa Bay. In Durban he drifted into a succession of menial jobs before joining the Natal mounted police. From 1899 to 1901 he fought in the South African War. In 1903 he finally returned to England, and in the same year he married Lilian Maud (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of Theodore Henry Schweitzer, of Bristol. There were no children.<br>
<br>Billing was quick to see the military significance of air power, and this gave purpose to an otherwise chaotic life. He edited the new journal <span class="italic">Aerocraft</span> (1908&#150;10), and in 1908 designed and tested, on his own airstrip in Fambridge, Essex, three light monoplanes, two of which left the ground. Billing then threw himself into land speculation, writing, yacht broking, and ship-running. By 1913 he had amassed enough capital to found a yard on Southampton Water, where he pioneered the construction of flying boats (supermarines). With characteristic bravado he had meantime obtained a pilot's certificate after only four hours two minutes in the air.<br>
<br>In 1914 Billing joined the Royal Naval Air Service. He organized the raid on the Zeppelin sheds in Friedrichshafen in November 1914. But in early 1916, then a squadron commander, he retired in frustration in order to publicize his complaints about the way the war in the air was being conducted. The tall, monocled, and debonair Billing drew large enthusiastic crowds to his meetings. Although defeated as an independent candidate at Mile End in January 1916, he succeeded two months later at another parliamentary by-election at East Hertfordshire. Revelling in his role of &#145;first air member&#146;, Billing campaigned for a unified air service, helped force the government to establish an air inquiry, and advocated reprisal raids against German cities. He also became adept at exploiting a variety of popular discontents. In spring 1918 his increasingly outrageous language led to his being prosecuted for criminal libel by the dancer Maud Allan. With his usual flair for publicity, Billing conducted his own defence, amusing and scandalizing the nation with his claim that the German government was in a position to blackmail 47,000 prominent British &#145;perverts&#146;, among them Herbert Asquith and his wife, whose names, he alleged, figured in a &#145;black book&#146;. On being acquitted, Billing further annoyed the main parties by running his own &#145;purity&#146; candidates at by-elections, under cover of an organization called the Vigilantes, of which he was president.<br>
<br>Although Billing retained his seat at the general election of 1918, ill health forced his retirement in 1921. In 1928 he had a play, <span class="italic">High Treason</span>, performed at the Strand Theatre. But most of his time was now absorbed by his various inventions, which included a miniature camera, a two-sided stove, and a gramophone; he claimed to have taken out 500 patents. He married second, on 8 December 1937, Elsie Veronica Jones (1892&#150;1978), the divorced wife of Owen Jones; she was the daughter of James Louis Farmer.<br>
<br>At the start of the Second World War Billing produced a design for a pilotless flying bomb; the British authorities turned it down. In 1941 he stood as an independent candidate in four by-elections, but although he retained his deposit on each occasion, there was to be no political comeback for this highly cantankerous patriot. Billing died on 11 November 1948 on his motor yacht <i>Commodore</i>, The Quay, Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex.<br>
