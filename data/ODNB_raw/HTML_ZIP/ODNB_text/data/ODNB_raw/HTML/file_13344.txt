<span class="headword">Hinderwell,  Thomas</span>  (1744&#150;1825), <span class="occ">philanthropist and antiquary</span>, was born on 17 November 1744 at St Nicholas Cliff, Scarborough, the elder son of the four children of Thomas Hinderwell (<i>bap</i>. 1705, <i>d</i>. 1798), master mariner and shipowner, and his wife, Rebekah (1716/17&#150;1797). At Coxwold grammar school, as a boarder, he studied classics and then, at the age of eleven, he was apprenticed to Robert Burn, a Scarborough master mariner. As ship's boy, master, and eventually owner he spent the next twenty years at sea. By 1775 he was rich enough to retire and settle ashore permanently at Scarborough. Three years later he was elected to the Common Hall, the corporation's ruling body, and in 1781&#150;2, 1784&#150;5, 1790&#150;91, and 1799&#150;1800 he served as one of the two bailiffs, the town's most senior officers. He finally stepped down as &#145;father of the Hall&#146; in 1816.<br>
<br>Unmarried and with more than sufficient income from his shipping interests Hinderwell devoted himself to many charitable causes: &#145;feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, instructing the ignorant, visiting the afflicted [and] saving the drowning&#146;  (Bottomley, 9). He was president of Scarborough's Trinity House and its Merchant Seamen's Society, both of which had local hospitals for &#145;broken seafarers&#146;, widows, and orphans. He was trustee and president of the Amicable Society, an Anglican charity that clothed and schooled the town's poorest children. Both the Lancasterian School and the School of Industry, which gave moral and practical instruction to poor girls, received gifts in his will. In 1812 he was founder and became first president of Scarborough's Auxiliary Bible Society. One of his most beneficial and lasting achievements was his campaign to provide Scarborough with a lifeboat, the second in Britain. He launched a public appeal for the lifeboat fund, chaired the lifeboat committee, and supported Henry Greathead's design. During its first year Scarborough's lifeboat saved the lives of at least five crews. Later he was responsible for founding Scarborough's Humane Society, which gave food, clothing, and accommodation to shipwrecked seamen. After his death his private collection of fossils and minerals formed the basis of Scarborough's Rotunda Museum when it opened in 1828.<br>
<br>Though he published many essays on subjects as varied as shipwrecks and Sunday observance, Hinderwell is most valued today for his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Scarborough and the Vicinity</span>, first published at York in 1798. A second, improved edition, dedicated to his friend and fellow campaigner against slavery, William Wilberforce, appeared in 1811; a third, posthumous revision, which included a tribute to the original author, was published in 1832. Hinderwell's was the earliest history of Scarborough, yet two centuries later it remains indispensable&#151;the mature fruit of wide reading, extensive travel, unrivalled local knowledge, privileged access to the corporation's rich archive, the expert research of his many professional assistants, and his own humanitarian wisdom. For his pioneer work Hinderwell engaged the services of Dr Belcombe, Scarborough's resident physician, Dr William Travis, surgeon and local antiquarian, the Revd Daniel Lysons, who devilled for him in the Tower of London and the British Museum, and the Revd Francis Wrangham, a formidable scholar and bibliophile, who gave him &#145;many interesting favours&#146;  (T. Hinderwell, <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Scarborough</span>, 2nd edn, 1811, vi).<br>
<br>Hinderwell died at his home in Newborough, Scarborough, on 22 October 1825 and was buried three days later in St Mary's parish churchyard, under the same plain gravestone as his father, mother, sister Ann, and brother-in-law. The executors of his will were directed to distribute &pound;50 worth of bread to the town's poor and &#145;to avoid the ostentation of a public funeral&#146;  (Cole, 39).<br>
