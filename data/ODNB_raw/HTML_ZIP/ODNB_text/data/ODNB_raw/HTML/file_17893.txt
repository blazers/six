<span class="headword">Mallory,  Thomas</span>  (1604/5&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Thomas Mallory of Davenham, Cheshire (<i>d</i>. 1644), dean of Chester, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28139/', "Richard Vaughan (c.1553&#150;1607)")</script>, bishop of London. He matriculated at New College, Oxford, on 15 October 1624 aged nineteen, graduated BA on 7 May 1628, and proceeded MA on 17 January 1632. In 1635, on the death of William Forster, he was presented by Richard Mallory of Mobberley and William Forster by reason of a grant from the dean (his father) and chapter of Chester, to the church of Northenden, Cheshire. However, doubts about the validity of the presentation seem to have given rise to his re-presentation by the king on 6 August 1635. It was perhaps about this time that Mallory married his first wife. Jane Mallory, however, died very young and was buried at Northenden on 12 February 1639; Thomas must have remarried shortly afterwards, for in 1644 his second wife, Mary, was reported to be looking after six of his children, for whom &pound;6 19<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. was provided by the committee for sequestrations. Mallory later claimed to have been ejected by Sir William Brereton in 1642. A Henry Root was in possession by 18 May 1643.<br>
<br>Mallory was evidently a committed and active royalist. Early in the civil war, as his son John informed John Walker, Mallory was imprisoned for a year at Stafford, but was released in exchange for a notable parliamentarian. From here, reports Walker, he travelled to Oxford, where he often preached before Charles I, and from there he repaired to Lichfield as chaplain to Sir Harvey Bagot, governor of the garrison. When the town fell Mallory returned to Northenden, joining the band of royalists who sought to defend Wythenshaw Hall, and effecting a dramatic escape before besieging troops under the command of Colonel Robert Dukinfeld stormed the building on 25 February 1644. In August the house and glebe at Northenden were sequestered.<br>
<br>Mallory was listed in May 1648 as a delinquent parson, still under sequestration, but in that month it was reported that the estate of his father the dean, who had died in April 1644, had been restored to the use of his mother, Elizabeth. It was at her house at Davenham, Cheshire, in July 1648, that the marriage of the Revd Henry Newcome took place, and Thomas probably officiated. Later Mallory served Norton in Moors, near Stoke upon Trent; his second wife, Mary, was buried at Astbury, just across the Cheshire border, on 26 June 1649. In 1651 Mallory gained a title to the rectory of Eccleston, Lancashire, when the incumbent, Edward Gee, signatory from Eccleston of the <span class="italic">Harmonious Consent</span> of the Lancashire preachers in 1648, was in prison. It is unclear whether Mallory actually entered this living during the Commonwealth, for Gee was released and in occupation before 27 May 1653. Gee died, however, on 27 May 1660, and Mallory was instituted to the rectory on 6 September on the presentation of the king. The next year he was readmitted to the rectory of Northenden, and on 11 April 1662, a government dispensation was granted to Mallory to hold both rectories, despite the distance of more than 30 miles between them.<br>
<br>Mallory evidently felt that his record warranted the gratitude of the restored house of Stuart. In his petition for the rectory of Houghton, Durham (endorsed on 9 July 1660), he claimed to have &#145;Served the late King in the war, and his Majesty in the late abortive attempt of the Cheshire gentlemen&#146;, that is, that he had been active under Sir George Booth in the summer of 1659  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 112). The bid for Houghton was rejected, and his petition of 13 July for the prebend of Stillington, York, also failed, for on 30 July Henry Bridgeman was presented to that dignity. However, in time Mallory received his reward. On 1 December 1660 he was made a DD by the University of Oxford. On 31 July 1661 he was collated to a canonry of Chester, and on 19 September he was admitted to the prebend of Wolvey, in Lichfield.<br>
<br>Mallory's pastoral efforts did not please everyone. Newcome recalled his &#145;learned unprofitable sermon to the generality of people&#146; on 9 November 1662, though it might have been worse: &#145;If the shepherd fed not as desired, yet the watchman smote not as was feared&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 138). Such remarks may reflect the diarist's anxieties in the aftermath of the Bartholomew purge; Newcome later suggested that Mallory had influence with the bishop of Chester. Mallory was still rector when he died in 1671 at nearby Brindle. He was buried at Eccleston on 8 September.<br>
