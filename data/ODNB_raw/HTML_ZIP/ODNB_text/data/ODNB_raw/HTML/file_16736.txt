<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Linley,  Thomas</span>  (1733&#150;1795), <span class="occ">impresario and composer</span>, was born at Badminton, Gloucestershire, on 17 January 1733 and baptized at Badminton parish church on 20 January, the eldest child of the carpenter William Linley (<i>bap</i>. 1704, <i>d</i>. 1792) and his wife, Maria (1701&#150;1792). He was evidently musically precocious, as on the family's move to Bath in 1744 he was apprenticed to the organist of Bath Abbey, Thomas Chilcot. As a child he may have studied in London with Domenico Paradies.<br>
<br>Linley sang&#151;in a &#145;particular natural stile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Richard Brinsley Sheridan</span>, 1.20)&#151;and played the harpsichord in Bath's Assembly Rooms concerts, directed by Chilcot, from 1755; after Chilcot's death in 1766 he ran the concerts. Linley's income must initially have derived chiefly from his numerous students, either visitors to Bath (such as Frances Sheridan) or young apprentices such as his own children. On 11 May 1752 Linley married Mary Johnson (1729&#150;1820), whose &#145;natural talents for musick were nearly equal to his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Nest of Nightingales</span>, 50), according to their lodger, Ozias Humphry.<h2>
<a name="ThegrowthoftheLinleyfamily"></a>The growth of the Linley family</h2>All eight Linley children who survived infancy (four did not) proved musically talented, and the three eldest in particular were greatly admired, <a href="#cosubject_16736">Thomas (Tom) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, as a violinist and later a composer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25364/', "Elizabeth Ann Linley")</script> and <a href="#cosubject_16734">Mary [<i>see below</i>]</a> as singers. The children regularly appeared in Linley's benefit concerts, and he boasted in 1767 that &#145;to merit their future Favour, it shall be his constant Study, by every Effort in his Power, to promote their Improvement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span>, 14 May 1767). Linley was both praised for nurturing his children's abilities and criticized for working them too hard; the flight of his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, to a French convent in 1772 may partly have stemmed from overwork, and on returning to England she spoke of Linley's &#145;promise&#146;  (Rae, 1.191) of fewer engagements. In 1772 Richard Brinsley Sheridan told his father that &#145;Mr. Linley and his whole family, down to the seven year olds are to support one set [of oratorios] at the new [Assembly] Rooms, and a band and Singers from London another at the old&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Richard Brinsley Sheridan</span>, 1.23).<br>
<br>Other Bath musicians resented Linley's success: in 1771 Francis Fleming wrote that &#145;by dint of cong&eacute;'s and scrapes, and the plea of a young family to maintain, [Linley] excited the pity and compassion of the company so compleatly, that it became a customary phrase among them to say &#147;Let us go to poor L&#151;y's concert;&#148; by this means he <i>never failed</i> filling the concert room&#146;  (Fleming, 3.98), while others were effectively put out of business. Linley's appointment in 1771 as director of music at the New Assembly Rooms attracted particular resentment, both as the new rooms openly rivalled the old, and as Linley excluded four of his seven Pump Room players (including Fleming) from the new ten-strong band. Within months, the new band member William Herschel quarrelled with Linley and left the band, ostensibly over the lack of music stands, but actually because Linley refused to allow Elizabeth to sing in Herschel's benefit concert. Herschel, a composer and oboist from Hanover, had gone to Bath in 1767 to act as organist to the newly opened Octagon Chapel, and Linley responded with his own proprietary chapel, St Margaret's, in 1772. Linley was also director for the Long Room at Bristol Hotwells, and the Bath rivalry continued during Bristol's oratorio seasons of 1772&#150;4. Linley eventually triumphed in 1775, winning a monopoly of the oratorio seasons at both the old and the new rooms, his band alternating between the two.<br>
<br>As the family travelled farther afield&#151;to perform in Oxford, at the Three Choirs festivals, and in London oratorios&#151;Linley could use demand for his children, particularly the now famous Elizabeth, to his advantage. In his letter of October 1770 to the Covent Garden theatre manager, George Colman, Linley agreed that a daughter (probably Elizabeth) could sing in the 1771 oratorios (for the very high fee of &#145;200 Guineas, and a clear Benefit&#146;), but:<blockquote>It is contrary to my Inclination that my Daughter should sing at either House for the Oratorio's, or anywhere else in London, where I am not myself a Principal in the Undertaking&#151;for were I properly settled in London, I think I could conduct the Business of Oratorios myself, whenever an opportunity offered for me to attempt it &hellip; In regard to engaging her as an Actress, I shall never do that, unless it were to ensure myself and Family a solid Settlement, by being admitted to purchase a share in the Patent on reasonable Terms &hellip; w<sup>ch</sup> I perceive no probability of obtaining&#151;and I shall never lay myself at the mercy of my Children, especially when their very power of being service to me depends so entirely upon Chance. (Colman, 150&#150;1)</blockquote>In 1773 John Christopher Smith and John Stanley contracted Elizabeth, Mary, and Tom for the Drury Lane season of Lenten oratorios; the <span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span> for 1 April reported that &#145;The two Linleys carry all before them&#146;, estimating receipts at over &pound;500 a night. The sisters' fee for the Foundling Hospital concert that year was an unprecedented &pound;80. The <span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span> for 19 April estimated that Linley had made nearly &pound;10,000 by Elizabeth's voice; Elizabeth, however, had just married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25367/', "Richard Brinsley Sheridan")</script>, and he had terminated her singing career. In November 1773 Linley declined the Pantheon's request for Mary to sing (Sheridan having had first refusal for Elizabeth), but told Sheridan that he would have liked to &#145;make the People here [Bath], sensible, that I am not absolutely dependent upon them, which they seem mightily inclined to believe, as Your Wife is no more to appear in Publick&#146;  (Gillaspie, 226).<h2>
<a name="LinleyatDruryLane"></a>Linley at Drury Lane</h2>In 1774, when Smith retired from co-managing the Drury Lane oratorios, George III recommended Sheridan to succeed him (evidently hoping Elizabeth would sing again); Sheridan declined, but proposed Linley instead, who, he said, had &#145;twenty Mrs. Sheridans more&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Richard Brinsley Sheridan</span>, 1.86). Garrick offered Linley a seven- or fourteen-year contract to co-manage the Drury Lane oratorios, as part of which his daughters Mary and <a href="#cosubject_16733">Maria [<i>see below</i>]</a> would join the Drury Lane company. Linley rejected this offer, but negotiations were renewed and from 1776 he ran the oratorios with Stanley. The latter retired in 1784; Linley's subsequent colleagues were Samuel Arnold until 1793 and Stephen Storace in 1794. The eleven-night season was generally profitable, and if in 1779 it cleared about &pound;500, in 1794, in a new Drury Lane theatre which opened on the first oratorio night, profits were over &pound;4000.<br>
<br>On retiring in 1776 David Garrick sold his share of Drury Lane's patent to Linley and Sheridan. Linley was praised as &#145;an Example of great Merit &amp; Industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.1114), who &#145;will be of great Service&#151;Sing Song is much the Fashion, &amp; his knowledge of Musick &amp; preparing fit Subjects for the Stage, will be a Strength, that the Proprietors may depend upon, when the Heroines are prankish&#146;  (ibid., 3.1063). Linley for his part wrote to Garrick that he wished to &#145;remove myself from the place I am in, where I do not see the least chance of being any other than a Servant to ye [Assembly] Rooms&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 9.312). When the contract was signed, Linley and Sheridan paid &pound;10,000 each and Dr Ford, court physician, paid &pound;15,000; Linley's share came from mortgages on his Bath properties and on his share in the theatre. The Linleys moved to Norfolk Street in London, leaving their three youngest children, <a href="#cosubject_16735">Ozias Thurstan [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Jane Nash (1768&#150;1806), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16738/', "William Linley")</script>, in Bath, and when Sheridan took over from Garrick as manager of Drury Lane, Linley became musical director for &pound;500 per annum, and his wife became wardrobe mistress for &pound;1 10<i>s</i>. a week, in which capacity her parsimony grew legendary.<br>
<br>Insecurity may have played its part in preventing Linley from taking up Garrick's first offer: in 1775 he claimed he had &#145;great reason to be diffident of my own abilities and genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 2.101). His first venture in theatrical composition, for Thomas Hull's <span class="italic">The Royal Merchant</span> at Covent Garden, in 1767, had failed. One diarist noted that &#145;The music may be good, but the piece is trifling and childish&#146;  (<span class="italic">The London Stage, 1660&#150;1800</span>, pt 4, 3.1299). While in the Drury Lane post, Linley composed the music for several dialogue operas, pantomimes, and other pieces. Several of these were works written by his sons-in-law: he composed seven songs for Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (Covent Garden, 1775); wrote one song for Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (1777); wrote the music for <span class="italic">The Camp</span> (1778, attributed to Sheridan and Richard Tickell), and for Sheridan's <span class="italic">Monody on the Death of Garrick</span> (1779); added songs for Sheridan's revision of Henry Woodward's <span class="italic">Fortunatus</span> (1780); wrote for Sheridan's <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1781), though Watkins attributes the music to Elizabeth Sheridan  (Watkins, 2.93); and wrote for Tickell's <span class="italic">The Carnival of Venice</span> (1781). He wrote occasional music&#151;particularly songs&#151;for a variety of other pieces.<br>
<br>His post also required him to arrange others' music. Linley arranged, for example, choruses and accompaniments for Matthew Locke's music for <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (1776), for Purcell's and Arne's music for Dryden's <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> in John Philip Kemble's 1784 production, <span class="italic">Arthur and Emmeline</span>, and for Kemble's version of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1789). He adapted Andr&eacute; Gr&eacute;try's music for Sir George Collier's <span class="italic">Selima and Azor</span> (1776) and for John Burgoyne's <span class="italic">Richard Coeur de Lion</span> (1786). He compiled and wrote for several of James Cobb's pieces, <span class="italic">The Strangers at Home</span> (1785), <span class="italic">Hurly-Burley</span> (1785), <span class="italic">Love in the East</span> (1788), and <span class="italic">The Haunted Tower</span> (1789). Charles Burney said that in his theatrical duties Linley &#145;gave more satisfaction, and escaped censure, public and private, by his probity and steady conduct, more than is often allowed to the governor of such a numerous and froward family&#146;  (Rees), no doubt intending a contrast with Linley's wayward son-in-law Sheridan. Linley was admitted to the Royal Society of Musicians in 1780.<br>
<br>Linley's forte was vocal music, and the Drury Lane d&eacute;buts of his singing students, such as Anna Maria Crouch, Ann Field, and Charles Dignum, regularly featured his songs. As well as individual songs, Linley published <span class="italic">Elegies for Three Voices</span> (<i>c</i>.1770) and <span class="italic">Twelve Ballads</span> (1780). In 1800 his widow published <span class="italic">The posthumous vocal works of Mr. Linley and Mr. T. Linley, consisting of songs, duetts, cantatas, madrigals and glees</span>. Linley also published a series of letters &#145;On music&#146; (in fact, on singing) in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (1792). Of the <span class="italic">Elegies</span>&#151;of which Linley was so proud that he was painted with a copy&#151;Burney said that Linley had &#145;stedfastly adhered to a style of [his] own, which seems to have been formed upon the melodies of our best old English masters, and those of the last age, that were most worthy of being preserved&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.1016&#150;17).<br>
<br>Linley was widely respected as a singing teacher. Michael Kelly praised his &#145;masterly instructions&#146;  (Kelly, 164), while William Thomas Parke described his teaching abilities as &#145;almost unrivalled in England&#146;  (Parke, 1.203). No doubt his &#145;grave&#146; manner contributed to his success: Anna Maria Crouch described him as &#145;dark, stern, and gigantic; I tremble sometimes when I look at him&#146;  (Young, 1.84). At least some of Linley's gravity was due to the deaths of his children, particularly Tom in 1778, Samuel (a talented oboist, who died from a fever caught at sea) in 1781, Maria in 1784, Mary in 1787, and Elizabeth in 1792. Mary Young said that, at a play rehearsal after Tom's death, when one of the characters:<blockquote>gave an impressive description of a promising young man &hellip; the feelings of Mr. Linley could not be repressed, the tears of mental agony rolled down his cheeks; nor did he weep alone, the cause of his distress was too well known not to obtain the tears of sympathy from many who beheld <i>his</i> flow so fast. (Young, 1.79)</blockquote>Linley became increasingly melancholy and unwell (suffering from giddiness and loss of memory) in his latter years. He died on 19 November 1795 at 11 Southampton Street, Westminster, and was buried with his daughters Elizabeth and Mary on 29 November 1795 in Wells Cathedral.<br>
<br>It was reported that Linley left a fortune of &pound;25,000 on his death  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.521). In his will, made in 1788, he left to his &#145;Dear Wife&#146; most of his household possessions and &pound;300 per annum, also making lesser annual financial provision for his surviving children (Elizabeth, Ozias, William, and Jane), and for his grandsons Richard and Samuel Tickell. Elizabeth was left his harpsichord, music books, and manuscripts; his sons Ozias and William his other musical instruments; his estate at Didmarton, Gloucestershire, was left to Ozias; bequests of &pound;100 were made to his grandson Thomas Sheridan, his granddaughter Elizabeth Tickell, and his daughter Jane. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine's</span> obituary gave measured praise:<blockquote>His works are not distinguished by any striking marks of original genius, but they uniformly manifest taste, feeling, and a full knowledge of his art. The publick are indebted to him for many beautiful airs; he has harmonized with great judgement the melodies of former writers; and, if it was not in his power to astonish by sublime effects, his compositions always soothe and charm by delicacy, simplicity and tenderness. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 65/2, 1795, 973)</blockquote>Linley's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_16736"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Linley junior</span>  (1756&#150;1778), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born on 5 May 1756, probably at Linley's house on Abbey Green, Bath. Known to his family and friends as Tom, according to Matthew Cooke he had an &#145;early and strong passion for Music&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 9.316). He was taught the violin by David Richards, of the Bath assembly rooms band, and was already singing and playing the violin in public in 1763. He then went to London to study with William Boyce for five years. In 1767 he made a much praised London stage d&eacute;but at Covent Garden in Thomas Hull's <span class="italic">The Fairy Favour</span>. In 1768 Tom went to Florence to spend three years under Pietro Nardini. There he met and befriended the young Mozart, and Burney said that the two were &#145;talked of all over Italy, as the most promising geniusses of this age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Musical Tour</span>, ed. Scholes, 184). Tom returned to England to act as soloist and leader in his father's concerts, both on the oratorio circuit and, from 1776, in London. His compositions also excited attention: by 1776 about twenty violin concertos were added to six sonatas written in 1768 under Boyce's tutelage. His first anthem, &#145;Let God arise&#146;, written for the 1773 Three Choirs festival in Worcester, achieved particular praise for its technical sophistication. For <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> he wrote the overture and several songs, and arranged two-thirds of the music. Once attached to Drury Lane he wrote a <span class="italic">Lyric Ode</span> on Shakespeare's supernatural creatures (1776), incidental music for <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1777), and a comic opera <span class="italic">The Cady of Bagdad</span> with a libretto by Abraham Portal (1778). His short oratorio <span class="italic">The Song of Moses</span> (1777) was described as one of the &#145;finest specimens of the Simple, Affecting, Grand and Sublime styles that ever was produced by the pen of a Musician&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 9.317). W. T. Parke nominated Tom Linley to the Royal Society of Musicians in 1777. He seemed to be in the early stages of a brilliant career; but his life was to be dramatically and tragically cut short. In summer 1778 he accepted a position as music teacher to the daughter of Peregrine Bertie, third duke of Ancaster, at Ancaster's country estate of Grimsthorpe in Lincolnshire. On 5 August 1778 he fell in the lake at Grimsthorpe while boating and was drowned. He was buried in the Ancaster family vault at Edenham parish church, Lincolnshire. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_16734"></a><span class="headword">Mary Linley <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Tickell]</span></span>  (1758&#150;1787), known as Polly, made her first London stage appearance at Covent Garden in 1769 as Sally in George Colman's <span class="italic">Man and Wife</span>, playing her part &#145;with great humour and vivacity&#146; (<span class="italic">Freeholder's Magazine</span>, Oct 1769, quoted in <span class="italic">A Nest of Nightingales</span>, 79). She was principally a <span class="occ">singer</span>, however, and after a brief period at a boarding-school in Bristol or Wells toured with her family, appearing in a variety of oratorios and concerts from 1771. Mary was always overshadowed by Elizabeth: even in looks, Frances Burney exclaimed, she was &#145;handsome, but <i>nothing</i> near her sister&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Journals and Letters</span>, 3.226). Garrick tried to contract Mary and Maria for Drury Lane theatre in 1775, in exchange for a seven- or fourteen-year contract co-managing the theatre oratorios for Linley: he wrote to Colman from Bath of a secret to &#145;make your hairs stand on End!&#151;I believe I may engage the blood of the Linleys!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.1003). Although Sheridan agreed with Linley that Mary's &#145;Talents for the Stage &hellip; are undoubted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Richard Brinsley Sheridan</span>, 3.305), he persuaded Linley that acting careers would be improper, especially given his daughters' musical abilities: &#145;Polly is certainly at present considered <i>here</i> as the best <i>Oratorio</i> Singer there now is, and tho' her Sister Maria may come to surpass her in some things&#151;She will always be respectable and in the first Line&#146;  (ibid., 3.303). Mary sang in her father's Drury Lane oratorios until 1779. The <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> for 24 February 1776 reported that<blockquote>Miss Linley, last night, in Acis and Galatea, gave every delight that the ear, the heart, or understanding could receive from music &hellip; Miss Linley's manner of delivering Recitative is peculiarly distinct and sensible &hellip; Her voice is clear and melodious, and capable of the truest expression.</blockquote>She ceased her singing career when she married, at St Clement Danes on 26 July 1780, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27431/', "Richard Tickell (1751&#150;1793)")</script>, a sometime playwright and political pamphleteer, and a practical joker suited to her own witty temperament. The Tickells initially lived at Wells, but when Tickell was made a commissioner of the stamp office they moved to rooms in Hampton Court, although they also kept a house in Brook Street and then Queen Anne Street, Westminster. If Tickell and Sheridan were close friends (Mary jokingly accused her husband of &#145;Sheridanisms&#146;; <span class="italic">A Nest of Nightingales</span>, 79), Mary and Elizabeth were closer, and supported each other against their husbands' thoughtlessness and irresponsibility. The Tickells had three children, Elizabeth Ann 
    (Betty; 1781&#150;1860)
  , Richard Brinsley (1783&#150;1805), and Samuel (1785&#150;1817). When Mary died from tuberculosis at Bristol Hotwells, Gloucestershire, on 27 July 1787, the children were entrusted to Elizabeth's care; Betty became her ward. Mary was buried in Wells Cathedral.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_16733"></a><span class="headword">Maria Linley</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was the eighth child of Thomas and Mary Linley, baptized on 10 October 1763 at St James's, Bath. She was evidently prodigiously talented, if Garrick was attempting to engage her at twelve. Sheridan wrote to Linley that Garrick was &#145;particularly stimulated by the Reputation of what Maria promises to be, in whom He hopes to forestall at least another Mrs. S.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Richard Brinsley Sheridan</span>, 3.295), adding that &#145;whatever you <i>did</i> get by Betsey&#151;and what more you <i>might</i> have got &hellip; you <i>may</i> get and if you rely only on yourself, certainly <i>will</i> get by Maria&#146;  (ibid., 3.303). Maria's sexual orientation is uncertain; Mary's letters seem to suggest that her headstrong sister may have had an affair with &#145;the well-timber'd [Miss] Troward&#146;  (Black, 133), and she occasionally dressed in men's clothing. Maria sang in the Drury Lane oratorios from 1776 to 1783, but in 1784 contracted a fever that led to her death at Bath on 5 September 1784. Her brother William told Michael Kelly that &#145;After one of the severest paroxysms of the dreadful complaint, she suddenly rose up in her bed, and began the song of &#145;I know that my Redeemer liveth&#146; in as full and clear a tone as when in perfect health&#146;  (Kelly, 238). The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>'s obituary stated: &#145;Her death is a loss almost irreparable to the musical world &hellip; The union of a sweet voice, correct judgement, extensive compass, and, above all, beauty of mind and person distinguished this much-lamented maid&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 54/2, 1784, 717).<br>

<a name="cosubject_16735"></a><span class="headword">Ozias Thurstan Linley</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1765, <em>d.</em> 1831), <span class="occ">composer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at Bath Abbey on 22 August 1765, the ninth child of Thomas and Mary Linley. He was left in Bath when the Linleys moved to London, as were William and Jane (the only Linley daughter not trained as a professional singer, though she sang very well). He lodged with his paternal grandparents, and was taught music and mathematics by William Herschel. Ozias demonstrated early &#145;Traits of a strong understanding&#146;, though his father was &#145;apprehensive of his being very deficient in common sense&#146;  (Lubbock, 43), and indeed he was later known for his absentmindedness and eccentricity. Although he composed some liturgical pieces (some surviving in the Royal College of Music, London, with work by his brother William), Ozias preferred theoretical to practical music. He matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 19 March 1785 and proceeded BA in 1789. He was made a minor canon of Norwich Cathedral in 1790 through the offices of his beloved sister Elizabeth. In 1807 and 1815 he received two livings from the cathedral, those of Stoke Holy Cross, Norfolk, and Trowse with Lakenham, Norfolk, respectively, but in 1816 moved to Dulwich College, Dulwich, Surrey, where he became junior fellow and organist. He died at Dulwich College on 6 March 1831, and was buried in the college chapel. He was unmarried.<br>
