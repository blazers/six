<span class="headword">Bossewell,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1580), <span class="occ">author</span>, was apparently a member of the family of Bosvile, from near Doncaster, and possibly the son and heir of Thomas Bosvile of Stainton. The course of his life is unrecorded, but his will and inventory, both drawn up in 1580, shed valuable light upon the circumstances of his later years. He claimed the status of gentleman, and in his will describes himself as a notary public, then living in the Hampshire parish of Kingsclere. He records the name of his wife as Joan, and makes her his sole executor. They seem to have had no surviving children, but there are legacies to a second John Bossewell and to the latter's brother William, &#145;whom I have brought up of a Childe&#146;, as well as to seven godsons. He left to William all his apparel, his silver notary's seal, and all his law books. There were also bequests for a funeral sermon, for a peal of bells before and after his obsequies, and for a distribution of alms to the poor. His goods were assessed at a total value of &pound; 72 15<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. Bossewell directed that he was to be buried in Kingsclere church, where his armorial brass was recorded in 1911.<br>
<br>Bossewell is remembered today as a heraldist. His book, <span class="italic">Workes of Armorie</span>, was published by Totell in 1572, and the inventory of his possessions lists a number of the writings cited in it, for instance those of Alciatus and Froissart. It also records his ownership of &#145;The olde boke of blazon of Armes&#146;, which directly concerns a major topic of Bossewell's book, namely the description of coats of arms in the heralds' traditional Norman-French blazon, which he often illustrates in his text with small attractive woodcuts intended to clarify the technicalities of heraldry. However, although <span class="italic">Workes of Armorie</span> draws heavily on the writings of his older contemporary Gerard Legh, whom Bossewell terms &#145;a very fruteful and worthy writer&#146;  (Bossewell) in his dedicatory epistle to Lord Burghley, Bossewell's work never achieved the popularity of Legh's <span class="italic">Accedens of Armory</span>, and it was reprinted only once, in 1597.<br>
<br>Like Legh's book, Bossewell's treatise has been censured as being of little value &#145;even from an heraldic point of view&#146;. Thomas Moule, writing early in the nineteenth century, considered the book &#145;strangely connected with the Ancient Mythology, and the Virtues personified&#146;  (Moule, 21), and it is true that Bossewell is as interested in the symbolism of the heraldic charges he discusses as he is in blazon. Yet for all its mixture of history, mythology, and mineral and animal lore (mainly in the bestiary tradition), Bossewell's <span class="italic">Workes of Armorie</span> is an interesting essay in linking heraldry with virtue. He draws on numerous Latin texts, as well as French writers, cites such English authors as Lydgate, Gower, Sir Thomas Eliot, and Richard Grafton, and quotes extensively from Chaucer, including the Wife of Bath on gentility. Arcane and full of remarkable, if implausible, information, Bossewell's work is none the less interesting as an example of the sort of learning that delighted Tudor antiquarians.<br>
