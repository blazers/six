<span class="headword">Kidd,  William</span>  (1803&#150;1867), <span class="occ">publisher and ornithologist</span>, was born on 12 September 1803 in London, where he was baptized at St George, Hanover Square, on 9 November 1803, the son of William Kidd and his wife, Christian. He was apprenticed early in life to Baldwin, Craddock, and Joy, a firm of London booksellers. He afterwards entered business on his own account, and had shops successively in Chandos and Regent streets, London. He married on 3 July 1831 Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Millham (1801&#150;1867).<br>
<br>While at Chandos Street Kidd published a <span class="italic">Guide to Gravesend</span>, <span class="italic">Popular Little Secrets</span>, and other short essays written by himself. Between May and October 1835 he published twenty-four numbers of a weekly, <span class="italic">London Journal</span>, dealing with natural history; from 1852 to 1854 he brought out a similar monthly periodical called <span class="italic">Kidd's Own Journal</span> (later reissued), and during 1863&#150;4 published ten numbers of <span class="italic">Essays and Sketches</span> on miscellaneous subjects. By that date he had sold his business, and devoted himself entirely to his favourite studies. He was always a keen student of nature, and possessed an astonishing gift of endearing himself to animals. In the later years of his life he lived in New Road, Hammersmith, and set up a fine aviary, which was burnt down and never rebuilt.<br>
<br>Kidd was an independent and eccentric thinker, and talker on religious and social subjects, and delivered many lectures in various parts of the country, under titles such as &#145;Genial gossip&#146;, &#145;Fashion and its victims&#146;, &#145;The value of little things&#146;, and &#145;Happiness made comparatively easy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Mercury</span>, 8 March 1856). As a naturalist Kidd's chief works were: <span class="italic">The Canary</span> (1854), <span class="italic">The Aviary and its Occupants</span> (2 pts, 1856), and a number of small books on the goldfinch, the linnet, and other British song birds. He also wrote an introduction to Westcott's <span class="italic">Autobiography of a Gossamer Spider</span> (1857) and, with F. Buckland, several papers in <span class="italic">Birds and Bird Life</span> (1863), besides contributing papers on birds and related subjects to the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, and similar periodicals. Between 1854 and 1856 he published many pamphlets on ephemeral subjects, such as <span class="italic">The Heart's Proper Element</span> (1854), <span class="italic">The Strange Spirits of the Day</span> (1855), and <span class="italic">The Charmed Ring</span> (1856).<br>
<br>Kidd died at his home, 3 Talbot Villas, New Road, Hammersmith, London, on 7 January 1867, his wife surviving him.<br>
