<span class="headword">Massey,  John</span>  (1650/51&#150;1715), <span class="occ">dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and Roman Catholic convert</span>, was born at Wedhampton, Wiltshire, the son of John Massey, a puritan minister. He matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 16 March 1666, aged fifteen (as John Macie), and was listed among the college's servitors in 1669/70, Anthony Wood recording that he was servitor of Obadiah Walker, fellow of University College. (Foster, <span class="italic">Alum. Oxon.</span>, confuses this John Massey with a John Massey who matriculated at Magdalen College in 1669.) He graduated BA from University in 1670, and on 10 April 1672 was admitted probationer fellow of Merton College, from where, on 29 January 1676, he proceeded MA. His academic career was undistinguished, with no known published works. He drank, and quarrelled, with Anthony Wood; assisted the Maurists by collating St Augustine; and was one of the six who took &#145;a course on chimistrie&#146; in September 1683, joining the Philosophical Society on 26 March 1684  (G&uuml;nther, 1.47). He served as proctor in 1684&#150;5, after which he was a delegate to raise a regiment of scholars and a troop of horse to combat Monmouth's rebellion.<br>
<br>This support for James II must have drawn Massey to the king's attention, and he was rewarded in October 1686 with the deanery of Christ Church. The king's patent, dated 16 December, specifically exempted Massey from the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, subscribing the Articles, and (unusually for the dean of an Anglican cathedral) celebrating or receiving the sacrament of the Church of England. The king promised him exemption from all prosecution, &#145;notwithstanding that the said John Massey is not consecrated priest, or is or at any rate hereafter shall be a convict Recusant&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 30, fol. 163<i>v</i>). Clearly he was, or at any rate was about to be, a Catholic, influenced probably by the vicar apostolic of all England, John Leyburn, more than Walker.<br>
<br>Massey's tenure of the deanery was short but energetic. In March 1687 he declared himself a Catholic, furnished an oratory, and appointed a Jesuit chaplain named Ward. As a justice of the peace from July 1687 he dealt with scoffers who disrupted services at his own and Walker's chapels. He helped Walker to print Catholic works, including those of Abraham Woodhead, provoking considerable anti-Catholic response. When the king visited Oxford later that year he attended Massey's chapel on Sunday 4 September and, speaking the following day, the king alluded to the attacks on Catholic chapels, urging all to practise charity. Despite this the subdean and canons of Christ Church consistently opposed Massey. Ignoring the king's dispensation they denounced him for not receiving the sacrament and forged a note purporting to be from Sunderland ordering Massey to expel all non-Catholic students. Massey saw through this and reported it to the king, who commended him for his integrity. Although Hearne believed that Massey &#145;lived amongst them with great respect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.343), in reality the senior members of Christ Church &#145;did everything they could to give him a rough ride&#146;, while undergraduates were &#145;insolent and unruly&#146;  (Beddard, 935). The university pointedly ignored the king's request to make him a DD.<br>
<br>The Dutch invasion in autumn 1688 extinguished Massey's career, and he had to flee Oxford before daybreak on 30 November. From London he escaped to the exiled court in St Germain disguised as a trooper. He entered the English College at Douai on 14 December 1692, moving soon afterwards to the oratorian seminary at St Magloire, where he was supported by Mary of Modena, wife of the exiled James II. He was ordained by August 1695, when he became confessor to the famous blue nuns in Paris, moving into the convent at rue de Charenton, faubourg St Antoine, Paris, as chaplain on 23 December 1699. He presided at professions and jubilees of the community, who referred to him as &#145;our worthy Confessor&#146;  (Gillow and Trappes-Lomax, 65). A friend of Hearne visited him there and found him &#145;in a very chearfull condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.343). There he died, on 11 August 1715, and was buried in the church, leaving his rented property and library to the convent charities.<br>
