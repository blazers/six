<span class="headword">Gordon,  James Edward</span>  (1789&#150;1864), <span class="occ">politician and protestant propagandist</span>, was born in Scotland (either in Abernethy, near Perth, or in Aberdeen) on 11 March 1789, one of the numerous children of James (Brae) Gordon of Little Folla, factor to the duke of Gordon, and Ann McDonald. He joined the Royal Navy at the age of fifteen on 14 April 1804. He became a lieutenant in 1811, and in 1814 commanded the schooner <i>St Lawrence</i>, on the strength of which he later called himself &#145;captain&#146;. After 1815 he first involved himself with the religious and social work of Thomas Chalmers in Glasgow and then moved to London where he initially promoted seamen's charities and was an associate of the evangelical Clapham Sect.<br>
<br>During the 1820s Gordon became a leading figure in the radically conservative wing of Anglican evangelicalism, which rejected compromise with the world and eschewed theological and political liberalism. Above all he was vehemently anti-Catholic, a position that was crystallized by his involvement in the second reformation movement in Ireland. In 1827 he founded the British Society for Promoting the Religious Principles of the Reformation (later Protestant Reformation Society) as a vehicle for outright proselytism, and during the next few years participated in numerous public debates with Roman Catholics, both in Britain and in Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1831 Gordon was returned as MP for Dundalk and in the House of Commons clashed frequently with Daniel O'Connell over the Irish education question and the government grant to Maynooth College. He saw himself as the political leader of the evangelicals, but in reality his views were too extreme and his style too combative for him to command general support. Accordingly, when he lost his seat as a result of the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> his efforts to return to parliament were unsuccessful.<br>
<br>Shifting his energies to pressure-group politics, Gordon played a leading role in orchestrating the No Popery crusade of 1834&#150;6 and in organizing the Protestant Association as a focus for the anti-Catholic campaign. Shortly afterwards a serious paralytic illness, from which he never fully recovered, forced his retirement from active public life. In spite of the strong antagonisms he had aroused, he had been a key figure in the religious and political reorientation of evangelicalism and in its forging of an alliance with the resurgent Conservative Party around the defence of the protestant established church.<br>
<br>In 1836 Gordon married Barbara, daughter of Samuel Smith, a banker and MP. They had a daughter and two sons, the younger of whom, George Maxwell Gordon, was a prominent missionary in the Punjab. Gordon died at 36 Porchester Square, Bayswater, on 30 April 1864.<br>
