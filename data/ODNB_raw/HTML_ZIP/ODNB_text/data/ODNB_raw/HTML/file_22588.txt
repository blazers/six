<span class="headword">Portman, Sir  William</span>  (1497/8&#150;1557), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of John Portman (<i>d</i>. 1521) of Orchard Portman, near Taunton, Somerset, and Alice, daughter of William Knoyle of Sandford Orcas in the same county. At his father's death Portman was aged twenty-three. His father was a bencher of the Middle Temple when William was admitted as a student in 1517. As early as 1532 Portman became a justice of the peace for Somerset, and by the 1530s he was chief steward both to the dean and chapter of Wells and to Glastonbury Abbey. He served in parliament in 1529 as member for Taunton, and probably in 1536. In the autumn of 1532 he gave his first reading in the Middle Temple, and in 1540, before his second reading, was nominated as a serjeant-at-law. He gave a second reading, as serjeant-elect, shortly before the creation in June. On 23 November 1540 he was appointed one of the king's serjeants, and on 14 May 1546 a justice of the king's bench, with a knighthood on the accession of Edward VI in 1547. His wife, Elizabeth, who predeceased him, was the daughter and heir of John Gilbert, a prominent Somerset landowner, and the widow of Giles Brent. They had one son (Sir Henry, of the Middle Temple, <i>d</i>. 1590) and a daughter (Mary Stowell).<br>
<br>From 1542 until his death Portman was an assize judge on the Oxford circuit. He adjusted well to the Marian regime, persuading his colleague Sir James Hales to abjure protestantism in 1554, and was promoted to be chief justice of England on 11 June 1555. He presided over the king's bench until his death on 5 February 1557. On 10 February he was buried with all legal pomp in St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, London, opposite the Temple, where his epitaph, armorial tabard, and penons were still to be seen in the next century. He had retained the family seat at Orchard; and his other property, whether by descent, marriage, or purchase, was mostly situated in the same county.<br>
