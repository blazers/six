<span class="headword">Williams,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Robert ap Gwilym Ddu]</span>  (1766&#150;1850), <span class="occ">poet and hymn writer</span>, only child of William Williams and Jane Parry, was born at Betws Fawr, a farm in the parish of Llanystumdwy, Caernarvonshire on 6 December 1766. He had some education locally but his mentors were the local poets of the area. His father was a substantial farmer and freeholder, and Williams succeeded him in the occupation of Betws Fawr. The farm also gave him the means to pursue his cultural, musical, and poetical interests, although he moved towards the end of his life to Mynachdy Bach in the same district.<br>
<br>Robert ap Gwilym Ddu, as Williams was styled in bardic circles, first became known as the winner in 1792 of the Gwyneddigion Society's medal for the best ode on the &#145;Massacre of the Bards&#146;. He immersed himself in <span class="italic">Gorchestion beirdd Cymru</span>, the anthology of Rhys Jones (1713&#150;1801) published at Shrewsbury in 1773, as well as in the classical poetry of Goronwy Owen (1723&#150;1769) which he read in <span class="italic">Diddanwch teuluaidd</span> (1763). He became an expert in the strict metre and encouraged poets to visit his home. Every Christmas, he insisted on a gathering of the local poets from the Caernarfon, Porthmadog, and Pwllheli area to enjoy a meal at Betws Fawr. They included teachers of poets such as David Thomas 
    (Dafydd Ddu Eryri; 1759&#150;1822)
   and his disciple, Griffith Williams 
    (Gutyn Peris; 1769&#150;1838)
  , as well as remarkable eisteddfodic poets of the calibre of Ebenezer Thomas 
    (Eben Fardd; 1802&#150;1863)
  . He consequently became an inspiration to those who regularly called on him, and he began to write religious verse and eschewed eisteddfodau after the one occasion when he did not get the prize for his effort.<br>
<br>Williams was the close friend and bardic tutor of his neighbour, David Owen 
    (Dewi Wyn; 1784&#150;1841)
  , whose mistrust of the eisteddfod authorities of the day he shared, and their names have been associated with a Baptist chapel called the Poets' Chapel (Capel y Beirdd). His poems, almost entirely religious or commemorative, were gathered together and edited by William Williams 
    (Caledfryn; 1801&#150;1869)
   and published at Dolgellau in 1841 under the title <span class="italic">Gardd Eifion</span>. They show a remarkable power of vigorous, clear expression, and include some of the best-known stanzas in the language. He and the Sandemanian Baptist minister John Richard Jones (1765&#150;1822) of Ramoth were great friends, and although Jones also wrote hymns, Williams's hymns have proved more enduring. Of particular note is his meditation on the sacrifice of Christ, with the familiar opening line, &#145;Mae'r gwaed a redodd ar y groes&#146;, which was published in the Welsh Baptist magazine <span class="italic">Seren Gomer</span>, in 1824. There are another twenty of his hymns in the collection published by J. R. Jones in 1822, under the title <span class="italic">Aleluia, neu, Caniadau Cristionogol</span>.<br>
<br>Williams died on 11 June 1850 at Mynachdy Bach, and was buried at Aber-erch cemetery, near Pwllheli. He married when he was fifty a young local girl; their only child, a daughter, Jane Elizabeth, died in 1834, at the age of seventeen, and <span class="italic">Gardd Eifion</span> contains an elegy upon her, described as &#145;one of the most poignant in the language&#146;.<br>
