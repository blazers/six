<span class="headword">Vorticists</span>  (<em>act. </em>1914&#150;1919), group of <span class="occ">artists and writers</span>, were conceived as British art's independent alternative to French cubism, Italian futurism, and German expressionism. The word &#145;vorticism&#146; was coined by the poet and critic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74521/', "Ezra Pound (1885&#150;1972)")</script> early in 1914, and he explained in the vorticists' magazine <span class="italic">Blast</span> that:<blockquote>the vortex is the point of maximum energy. It represents, in mechanics, the greatest efficiency. We use the words &#145;greatest efficiency&#146; in the precise sense&#151;as they would be used in a text book of Mechanics. (E. Pound, &#145;Vortex Pound&#146;, <span class="italic">Blast</span>, 1, 1914, 153)</blockquote>The most substantial and active vorticist artists were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36674/', "Edward Alexander Wadsworth (1889&#150;1949)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40715/', "Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (1891&#150;1915)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31614/', "William Patrick Roberts (1895&#150;1980)")</script>. Gaudier-Brzeska and Roberts contributed written material to <span class="italic">Blast</span> as well as illustrations of their work, and in 1914&#150;15 the sturdy Roberts executed some of the most impressive vorticist drawings and watercolours. Pound also contributed essays to <span class="italic">Blast</span>, and played a crucial part in supporting and defining the vorticist movement as a critic. But <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34517/', "(Percy) Wyndham Lewis (1882&#150;1957)")</script> was the dominant vorticist, performing a multi-faceted role as editor, artist, critic, and writer of fiction.<br>
<br>The arrival of vorticism was announced with great gusto, wit, and belligerence in the first issue of <span class="italic">Blast</span> (July 1914), edited by Lewis. Aggressive, cheeky, and wildly uninhibited, its opening manifestos set out to attack a wide range of targets. England was blasted first, &#145;from politeness&#146;, and its climate cursed &#145;for its sins and infections, dismal symbol, set round our bodies, of effeminate lout within&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blast</span>, 1, 1914, 11). Vorticism was self-consciously virile in character, and wanted to wage war on the legacy of the Victorian era. Lewis and his friends aimed at freeing England from the stifling influence of the past, and their magazine shouted: &#145;Blast years 1837 to 1900&#146;  (ibid., 18). They used laughter &#145;like a bomb&#146;, in order to discredit the forces which prevented England, and English art in particular, from realizing its full potential. The vorticist manifesto maintained that &#145;we are Primitive Mercenaries in the Modern World &hellip; a movement towards art and imagination could burst up here, from this lump of compressed life, with more force than anywhere else&#146;  (ibid., 30, 32).<br>
<br>The list of signatures at the end of the movement's rumbustious group manifesto included eleven names. But not all of them were closely involved with vorticism itself. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30366/', "Richard Aldington (1892&#150;1962)")</script>, who had collaborated with Pound in the poetic imagist movement, was a writer with only a marginal commitment to the vorticist aesthetic. Malcolm Arbuthnot (1874&#150;1967), an innovatory photographer who had organized a post-impressionist exhibition in Liverpool in 1913 and met Wyndham Lewis the following year at the Rebel Art Centre, London, never made vorticist photographs. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41128/', "Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882&#150;1966)")</script> performed that role in 1916&#150;17 when he invented vortography with Pound, but his signature did not appear in the <span class="italic">Blast</span> manifesto. The other nine names were all directly caught up in the vorticist cause: of these Gaudier-Brzeska, Lewis, Pound, Roberts, and Wadsworth are noticed elsewhere. The remaining members: Lawrence Atkinson, Jessica Dismorr, Cuthbert Hamilton, and Helen Saunders are noticed below.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64222"></a><span class="headword">Lawrence Atkinson</span>  (1873&#150;1931), <span class="occ">artist, writer, and musician</span>, was born on 27 January 1873 at 10 Leamington Street, Chorlton upon Medlock, Lancashire, the son of Leonard William Atkinson, a salesman of cotton goods, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnes. After attending Bowden College, Chester, he studied singing and music at Berlin and Paris, which he then taught in Liverpool and London, and gave concert performances. Self-taught as an artist, he first exhibited at the Allied Artists' Association in 1913, and moved from fauvism to vorticism when he joined Lewis's Rebel Art Centre in 1914. After appearing in the &#145;Invited to Show&#146; section of the &#145;First Exhibition of the Vorticist Group&#146; at the Dor&eacute; Gallery, London, in 1915, he published a book of poems called <span class="italic">Aura</span>. A solo exhibition of his painting and carving was held at the Eldar Gallery, London, in 1921, and that year his sculpture <span class="italic">L'oiseau</span> gained the grand prix at the Milan Exhibition. In later life he concentrated on sculpture, executing some remarkably abstract carvings. Atkinson died on 21 September 1931 in the American Hospital, Paris. He had been living at the Villa les Topares, Cannes. Examples of his work are in the Tate collection, including <span class="italic">The Lake</span> (pen and watercolour, <i>c</i>.1915&#150;1920).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64251"></a><span class="headword">Cuthbert Francis Hamilton</span>  (1884&#150;1958), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at 29 Talbot Road, Paddington, London, on 15 February 1884, the son of Thomas Sharp Hamilton, of the Bombay civil service, and his wife, Katharine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sharp. After studying at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1899 to 1903 (about the same time as Wyndham Lewis), he taught art at Clifton College, Bristol (1907&#150;10). Though he played a more minor role in the vorticist movement, he collaborated with Lewis on his decorations for Madame Strindberg's Cabaret Theatre Club in 1912, having previously been involved in the avant-garde cabaret club the Cave of the Golden Calf, decorated with murals and sculpture by Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill, Charles Ginner, Spencer Gore, and Wyndham Lewis. The art critic Roger Fry included Hamilton in the last month of the &#145;Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition&#146; held in London in 1912, and he joined the Omega Workshops designing furniture and interiors in the summer of 1913. But Hamilton joined Lewis in storming out of Omega later that year, and contributed to the &#145;Post-Impressionist and Futurist Exhibition&#146; in the autumn. Then, having been included in the &#145;Cubist Room&#146; section of a &#145;Camden Town Group and Others&#146; exhibition at Brighton, Hamilton joined the Rebel Art Centre and contributed an explosive, mechanistic illustration called <span class="italic">Group</span> to the first issue of <span class="italic">Blast</span>. He did not contribute to the vorticist exhibition in 1915, but rejoined the vorticists in 1920 when they exhibited together for the last time in Group X at the Mansard Gallery, London. One of Hamilton's few surviving works, his vigorous <span class="italic">Reconstruction</span>, is in the Tate collection. In later years he turned to pottery and sculpture, founding the Yeoman Potteries. Hamilton died on 5 January 1958 at his home, Shelleys, High Street, Cookham, Berkshire.<br>
<br>The two women associated with the vorticist movement are more substantial artists than Hamilton. <a name="cosubject_58059"></a><span class="headword">Jessica <span class="st"> [Jessie]</span>  Stewart Dismorr</span>  (1885&#150;1939)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 2 March 1885 at Hillcrest Lodge, West Hill, Gravesend, Kent, the daughter of John Stewart Dismorr, a colonial merchant, and his wife, Mary Ann Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clowes. She attended the Slade School of Fine Art in 1902&#150;3 before studying painting under Jean Metzinger, J. D. Fergusson, A. Dunoyer de Segonzac, and J.-E. Blanche at the Atelier La Palette, Paris, from 1910 to 1913. There she became a fauviste, and contributed to several issues of <span class="italic">Rhythm</span> magazine. Dismorr exhibited with S. J. Peploe and Fergusson at the Stafford Gallery, London, in 1912, and at the Salon d'Automne the following year. At about this time she met Wyndham Lewis and by 1914 had become an ardent member of the Rebel Art Centre. By the time she signed the vorticist manifesto Dismorr was working in a strongly abstract style. Her work was illustrated in the second issue of <span class="italic">Blast</span> (1915), where her writings were also published. The girder-like forms of her <span class="italic">Abstract Composition</span> (1914&#150;15; Tate collection) are suggestive of<blockquote>
<div>the new machinery that wields the chain of muscles fitted beneath<br>
</div>
<div>my close coat of skin.<br>
</div> (Dismorr, &#145;Monologue&#146;, <span class="italic">Blast</span>, 2, 1915)</blockquote>She showed in the vorticist exhibition in London in 1915, after which she left to carry out war work in France. Her work was included at the vorticist exhibition in New York in 1917, and her first solo exhibition was held at the Mayor Gallery, London, in 1925; the following year she was elected to the London Group and the Seven &amp; Five Society. Her involvement with the avant-garde continued throughout her life: during the 1930s she exhibited with the Association Abstraction&#150;Creation, and in 1937 contributed to <span class="italic">Axis</span> magazine. At the end of her life Dismorr was living at 17 Willoughby Road, London. She committed suicide by hanging herself at 21 St Edmund's Terrace, St Marylebone, London, on 29 August 1939.<br>
<br>Dismorr's friend <a name="cosubject_56581"></a><span class="headword">Helen Beatrice Saunders</span>  (1885&#150;1963)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 4 April 1885 at 10 Addison Road, Bedford Park, Chiswick, London, the daughter of Alfred Robert Henry Saunders, a solicitor, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Daley. After being educated at home, Saunders studied at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and at the Slade School of Fine Art (1906&#150;7), and exhibited with the Friday Club in 1912. By then her interest in post-impressionism was evident, and she showed her work at the Allied Artists' Association in 1912 and 1913. One of the first in Britain to work in a non-figurative style, Saunders reached her most extreme stage as a painter in 1914 when she exhibited at the Whitechapel Art Gallery's &#145;Twentieth Century Art&#146; exhibition and joined the Rebel Art Centre. Like Dismorr, she contributed a poem as well as an illustration to the second issue of <span class="italic">Blast</span>, and was included in the vorticist exhibitions in London and New York. But she came closest to Lewis when together they painted murals in the Vorticist Room at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Percy Street, London. At the end of her life Saunders was living at 39 Gray's Inn Road, Holborn, London. Following her accidental death by gas poisoning on new year's day, 1963, three of her works&#151;<span class="italic">Monochrome Abstract Composition</span> (<i>c</i>.1915), <span class="italic">Abstract Composition in Blue and Yellow</span> (<i>c</i>.1915), and <span class="italic">Abstract Multicoloured</span> (<i>c</i>.1915)&#151;were that year presented to the Tate Gallery in memory of her sister by Ethel M. Saunders.<br>
<br>The list of signatures in <span class="italic">Blast</span> excluded several artists whose work had much in common with the vorticists. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63132/', "Frederick Etchells (1886&#150;1973)")</script> certainly executed paintings and drawings which can confidently be described as vorticist. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33025/', "Jacob Epstein's (1880&#150;1959)")</script> <span class="italic">Rock Drill</span> (1913&#150;16; Tate collection) put many vorticist ideas into compelling sculptural form. But he was almost as determined to distance himself from vorticism as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37206/', "David Bomberg (1890&#150;1957)")</script>, who adamantly rejected Lewis's invitation to contribute to <span class="italic">Blast</span>. Bomberg also refused advances from the Italian writer and theorist Filippo Marinetti, who only succeeded in attracting the loyalty of one English artist: Christopher Nevinson (1889&#150;1946).<br>
<br>Most of the artists associated with the vorticist movement had previously been impressed by Marinetti and the Italian futurists, who first exhibited in London at the Sackville Gallery in March 1912. The vorticists sympathized with Marinetti's call for an art directly expressive of the new machine age, and they also admired the Italian leader's dynamic ebullience as a performer of his own poetry. But by 1914 they had begun to resent Marinetti's attempts to enlist them as members of the futurist movement. Pound, who had become dissatisfied with his earlier commitment to the imagist movement in poetry, was eager to involve himself with a new group. So was Wyndham Lewis, who explained his conception of the vortex by telling a friend to think &#145;at once of a whirlpool &hellip; At the heart of the whirlpool is a great silent place where all the energy is concentrated. And there, at the point of concentration, is the Vorticist&#146;  (D. Goldring, <span class="italic">South Lodge</span>, 1943, 65).<br>
<br>The stillness of the &#145;great silent place&#146; was far removed from Italian futurism, which preferred to rhapsodize about the machine age and convey its excitement through blurred, multiple images stressing the exhilaration of movement. Vorticisim valued energy, too, and Ezra Pound defined the vortex as &#145;a radiant node or cluster &hellip; from which, and through which, and into which, ideas are constantly rushing&#146;  (E. Pound, &#145;Vorticism&#146;, <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, 1 Sept 1914). But the vorticists preferred to define single forms rather than embrace flux, vagueness, and rapid motion. A vorticist picture is often explosive in its implications, using diagonal forms redolent of pistons and girders which reach out towards the edges of the composition. Alongside this restless energy, though, there is a counter-emphasis on firm, clear-cut forms, often enclosed by strongly defined contours. The vorticists were fascinated by the modern world, and wanted to incorporate its mechanistic structures in their work. But they tempered this enthusiasm with a cool, hard awareness of the machine age's impersonal harshness. They knew how dehumanized the modern urban world could be, and they saw no reason to echo the ecstatic romanticism of Marinetti's attitude towards twentieth-century dynamism.<br>
<br>The vorticists wanted to place this &#145;modern world&#146; at the very centre of their work. They filled their pictures with what <span class="italic">Blast</span> described as the &#145;forms of machinery, Factories, new and vaster buildings, bridges and works&#146;. But they had no desire to depict the world in too representational a style. Lewis criticized the futurists for &#145;their careful choice of motor omnibuses, cars, aeroplanes, etc.&#146;  (W. Lewis, <span class="italic">Blast</span>, 1, 1914, 144) and declared that &#145;the Automobilist pictures were too &#147;picturesque&#148;, melodramatic and spectacular, besides being undigested and naturalistic to a fault&#146;  (ibid.). Cubism, which had also influenced many of the vorticists at an early stage in their careers, was likewise criticized. Lewis announced that Picasso's cubist sculpture &#145;no longer so much interprets, as definitely makes, nature (and &#147;dead&#148; nature at that)&#146;  (ibid., 140).<br>
<br>The vorticists believed that their intentions could best be conveyed by a more abstract language. Not because they regarded total abstraction as a desirable end in itself: the vorticists thought that the machine age demanded a severely simplified, hard, bare approach. <span class="italic">Blast</span> proclaimed that machinery &#145;sweeps away the doctrines of a narrow and pedantic Realism at one stroke&#146;  (W. Lewis, <span class="italic">Blast</span>, 1, 1914, 39), enabling the vorticists to develop a language which contained many layers of reference. A vorticist picture can therefore be read in several different but equally legitimate ways. It might be seen as a map, a vision, an aerial view of the earth, a diagram, a blueprint for a machine, or a distillation of an urban scene with buildings and robot-like figures. All these possibilities were contained in a single image, and Lewis had no desire to restrict them in any way. He wanted vorticism to be richly allusive even as it refined and simplified its formal vocabulary. In 1915 he explained that the vorticist work of art should be &#145;a hallucination or dream (which all the highest art has always been) with a mathematic of its own&#146;  (W. Lewis, &#145;Note&#146;, <span class="italic">The First Exhibition of the Vorticist Group</span>, 1915, exhibition catalogue, Dor&eacute; Galleries, London).<br>
<br>Despite the rivalries within the group, vorticism stood a good chance of establishing itself as a major force. So indeed it did, but only for a short time. A few weeks after <span class="italic">Blast</span> was published, the First World War erupted. The militancy of vorticism was rapidly overtaken by the outright militarism of a call-to-arms. So the vorticists had little more than a year to develop their ideas. They enjoyed boisterous evenings at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel where Vorticist Room murals by Lewis and Saunders made an appropriately clangorous impact. The meetings were commemorated, nearly half a century later, in Roberts's monumental painting <span class="italic">The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915</span> (Tate collection). That year, which saw the first vorticist exhibition and the first issue of <span class="italic">Blast</span>, Lewis claimed in the magazine that &#145;we have subscribers in the Khyber Pass, and subscribers in Santa F&eacute;&#146;  (W. Lewis, <span class="italic">Blast</span>, 2, 1915, 7), but Gaudier-Brzeska had already been killed fighting at the front. He was widely mourned by other members of the movement, and by 1916 most of the vorticists were fighting in France.<br>
<br>Left at home, Pound persuaded the major American collector John Quinn to purchase vorticist work on a grand scale, and stage an &#145;Exhibition of the Vorticists&#146; at the Penguin Club, New York, in 1917. But when the vorticists returned from the war, they soon discovered that the world had changed irrevocably. They could not recapture the pre-war context of heady experimentation, in a cultural climate dominated by the need for a &#145;return to order&#146;. By 1920, despite Lewis's stillborn attempt to launch a third issue of <span class="italic">Blast</span>, the movement had ceased to exist.<br>
