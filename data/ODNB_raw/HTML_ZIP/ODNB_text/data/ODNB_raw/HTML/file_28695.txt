<span class="headword">Ward,  John</span>  (1825&#150;1896), <span class="occ">naval officer and surveyor</span>, was the son of Lieutenant Edward Willis Ward RN (<i>d</i>. 1855). He entered the navy in 1840 on the brig <i>Spey</i>, packet-boat to the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico. In November 1840 the <i>Spey</i> was wrecked on the Bahama bank, and young Ward was sent to the <i>Thunder</i>, then surveying the Bahamas. He passed his examination in December 1848, and was promoted lieutenant on 2 October 1850. He married, in 1852, Mary Hope, daughter of John Bowie of Edinburgh; they had at least one child. During 1851&#150;3 Ward was borne on the books of the <i>Fisgard</i> for surveying duties, and in March 1854 was appointed to the steamer <i>Alban</i>, then commanded by Captain Henry Charles Otter, and attached to the fleet in the Baltic, where she served usefully in destroying telegraphs and in reconnoitring in the neighbourhood of Sveaborg and at Bomarsund. In 1855&#150;6 he was with Otter in the <i>Firefly</i>, surveying on the coast of Scotland, and in February 1857 was appointed to command the <i>Emperor</i>, a steam yacht going out as a present to the emperor of Japan. In her he went with Lord Elgin to Yeddo, in August 1858, and, when the vessel had been handed over to the Japanese, returned to Shanghai in the <i>Retribution</i>.<br>
<br>On 24 September Ward was promoted to command the surveying ship <i>Actaeon</i>, and in her tender, the gunboat <i>Dove</i>, he accompanied Lord Elgin in his remarkable voyage up the Yang-tse, rendering important assistance in examining the navigable channels of the river. For the next three years he commanded the <i>Actaeon</i>, and in her surveyed the coast of the Gulf of Pecheli (Beizhili), including the harbours of Weihaiwei and Ta-lien-wan (Dalianwan), until then unknown, as also the Yang-tse for 200 miles above Han-kow (Hankou). For two years after paying off the <i>Actaeon</i> at the end of 1861, he was employed at the hydrographic office in printing the work of the survey, and in March 1864 he was appointed to the <i>Rifleman</i> to continue the survey of the China seas. In 1866 his health gave way, and he was obliged to return to England. He had no further service, and in 1870 accepted the new retirement scheme. On 24 September 1873 he was promoted captain on the retired list, and he died at London on 20 January 1896, at the age of seventy.<br>
