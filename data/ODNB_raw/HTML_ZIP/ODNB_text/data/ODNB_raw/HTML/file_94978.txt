<span class="headword">Tonge <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>White]</span>,  Susan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Susan Clarencius]</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1510, <em>d.</em> in or after 1564), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was probably the youngest of the four children of Richard White of Hutton in south Essex and his wife, Maud Tyrell, daughter of Sir William Tyrell of Heron, also in south Essex. She had an elder brother, Richard, and two older sisters, Mary and Jane. The events of her later life suggest that she was born towards the end of the first decade of the sixteenth century. Some time before 1534 she married Thomas Tonge (<i>d</i>. 1536), who must have been appreciably her senior, since he was already York herald by April 1513. He became Norroy king of arms at All Hallows 1522, and Clarenceux king of arms on 2 June 1534. He died in March 1536, leaving his widow as his executor and residuary legatee. Susan never married again, and it was from her husband's brief incumbency of his last position that she took the name by which she was known for the rest of her life. They appear to have had no children, or at least none who survived infancy. None is referred to in Thomas's will, and it was to her nephews that Susan disposed of her assets over twenty years later.<br>
<br>At some point between 1533 and 1536 Susan Clarencius entered the service of Princess Mary, probably through her husband's court connections rather than through those of her family. She does not appear in Mary's household list of 1533, but by June 1536 the princess was referring to her as an established and trusted servant. This was a very difficult period for Mary, who was out of favour with her father and had no control over appointments to her own service. But although Susan was probably appointed by Henry VIII to keep an eye on his daughter, rather than being chosen by the princess herself, a relationship developed between the two women, who were about ten years apart in age, which was to last for the rest of Mary's life, and brought her as close to personal friendship and mutual trust as she ever came. One of Susan's first formal duties was to attend her young mistress when Mary was chief mourner for Queen Jane Seymour in November 1537, and glimpses of her can be caught thereafter in the princess's household accounts. She was trusted with money, and bought special items like gold wire and cinnamon, while in 1543 and 1544 she even purchased the new year gifts that Mary was to present to her father&#151;in 1544 these cost over &pound;70. In 1543 her services brought her an annuity of &pound;13. 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. out of augmentations, which in the following year she surrendered in return for the Suffolk manor of Chepenhall.<br>
<br>The services that Susan Clarencius rendered to Princess Mary continued during the difficult years of Edward VI's reign. Although there is no evidence that she did not fully support her mistress's stand against the &#145;new ways&#146; in religion, she continued to receive grants of land for her &#145;services to the king's sister lady Mary&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1553</i>, 28), notably the Essex manor of Thundersley, worth about &pound;28 per annum. She also retained a place among the Essex gentry, being close both to her Tyrell cousins and to Sir William Petre, principal secretary successively to Edward VI and to Mary when the latter became queen. Although Susan held no title, her importance to Mary was generally recognized&#151;Jean Dubois, the imperial ambassador's secretary, described her as &#145;the chief lady in the princess's household&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1550&#150;52</i>, 221)&#151;and when Mary succeeded to the throne in July 1553 this importance was given formal expression by her appointment as mistress of the robes, the female equivalent of chief gentleman of the privy chamber. Although Susan was now outranked by the wives and daughters of peers who surrounded the new queen, the closeness of their relationship continued. In autumn 1553, when the new imperial ambassador, Simon Renard, was struggling to arrange Mary's marriage to Prince Philip of Spain, and in particular to fend off the claims of the home-grown candidate for the queen's hand, Edward Courtenay, first earl of Devon, he was able to report with satisfaction that &#145;Mrs Clarencius &hellip; supports our cause to the utmost&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1553</i>, 344). When on 29 October 1553 Mary solemnly and secretly swore on the sacrament to marry Philip, only Renard and Clarencius were present in the oratory.<br>
<br>Susan Clarencius continued to receive former church lands from the queen, although this should have been contrary to the principles of both women. The Essex manors of Runwell, Rivenhall, Chingford St Pauls, and Chingford Earls came her way in 1555, and by the end of Mary's reign she was probably receiving annual rents of about &pound;200 from her various properties, in addition to fees for her services at court. Mary's death on 17 November 1558, at which Susan was present, meant the end of the latter's public career. She could have retired to the life of an Essex gentlewoman, despite the difficulties arising from her Catholicism, but instead she attached herself to the household of the young Jane Dormer, who became countess of Feria on her marriage to Philip's special envoy in December 1558. She left England with the countess in July 1559, having earlier enfeoffed her properties to the use of her nephews, the sons of her brother Richard. Despite the efforts of various sympathizers she never received formal licence to go abroad, but under the protection of the count that hardly mattered. Sympathetically described as &#145;a good old woman&#146; in 1562  (<span class="italic">CSP foreign</span>, <i>1561&#150;2</i>, 520), she is recorded at intervals in the context of the Feria household and its English connections until spring 1564, when she disappears from the records. Probably she died in Spain about this time. Early in the seventeenth century Henry Clifford, an English servant of the duchess of Feria (as Jane Dormer had become), described Susan Clarencius as a woman &#145;who from the childhood of Queen Mary had served her, and ever in principal place about her; a woman respected and beloved by the Queen, who the rest of her life remained with the Duchess&#146;  (Clifford, 110). He had probably never met her.<br>
