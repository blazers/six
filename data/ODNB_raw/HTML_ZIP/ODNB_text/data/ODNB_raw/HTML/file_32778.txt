<span class="headword">Montmorency,  Raymond Harvey  de</span>, third Viscount Frankfort de Montmorency  (1835&#150;1902), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Theydon Bower, Epping, Essex, on 21 September 1835, was the only son of Lodge Raymond, second viscount (1806&#150;1889), and his wife, Georgina Frederica (<i>d</i>. 1885), daughter of Peter Fitzgibbon Henchy QC, of Dublin. Educated at Eton College and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned as ensign in the 33rd (Duke of Wellington's) regiment on 18 August 1854, promoted lieutenant on 12 January 1855, and served with his regiment during that year in the Crimea. He was in the trenches at the siege of Sevastopol and took part in the storming of the Redan on 8 September. For his gallantry at the assault he was recommended for the Victoria Cross, but he did not receive it. De Montmorency then accompanied his regiment to India. During the mutiny in 1857&#150;8 he commanded a detachment against the mutineers in central India.<br>
<br>Promoted captain on 29 March 1861, de Montmorency exchanged into the 32nd (Cornwall) regiment, and from 6 December 1861 to 31 December 1864 was aide-de-camp to his uncle by marriage, Major-General Edward Basil Brooke, who commanded the troops in the Windward and Leeward islands. From 4 June 1865 de Montmorency was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir John Michel, commanding the troops in British North America, and in 1866 took part in the repulse of the Fenians. He married on 25 April 1866, at Montreal, Rachel Mary Lumley Godolphin, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18649/', "Sir John Michel")</script>. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>While travelling in Abyssinia in 1867 de Montmorency volunteered under Sir Robert Napier in the campaign against King Theodore. He accompanied the expedition to the gates of Magdala, when all volunteers were recalled. He commanded the frontier force during the 1886&#150;7 Sudan operations, and in 1887, while commanding the troops at Alexandria with the local rank of major-general, he directed the operations of the British field column of the frontier force during the Nile operations. He was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted major-general on the establishment on 30 November 1889, and succeeded to the peerage on the death of his father on 25 December.<br>
<br>From 1890 to 1895 Lord Frankfort commanded a district in Bengal, and from 1895 to 1897 the Dublin district; he retired on 21 September 1897. A keen soldier, strict disciplinarian, and master of drill, and a kind and generous man, he died suddenly of apoplexy at his home, 30 Bury Street, St James's, London, on 7 May 1902, and was buried on the 12th in the village churchyard of Dewlish, Dorset. His wife survived him. Their eldest son, Raymond Harvey de Montmorency (1867&#150;1900), captain 21st lancers, won the Victoria Cross in the charge near Omdurman in 1898. He was killed in action in February 1900 at Molteno, Cape Colony, while commanding the corps of scouts he had organized and which bore his name.<br>
