<span class="headword">Lewis,  Hywel David</span>  (1910&#150;1992), <span class="occ">theologian and philosopher</span>, was born on 21 May 1910 at 5 Mostyn Crescent, Llandudno, the younger son of David John Lewis (1876&#150;1947), a Calvinistic Methodist minister, first in Llandudno and then in Caernarfon, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies (1865&#150;1953). His brother Alun Tudor Lewis (1905&#150;1986) was a schoolmaster and an author of short stories in Welsh. Hywel was educated at Caernarfon grammar school and at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where he developed his interest in philosophy. He graduated with a first-class degree in 1932. He returned to Bangor as a lecturer in philosophy after further studies at Jesus College, Oxford, from where he graduated with a BLitt in 1935. He became professor of philosophy at Bangor in 1947. Meanwhile, on 17 August 1943, he married a fellow university lecturer, Megan Jones (1909/10&#150;1962), daughter of John Elias Jones, an inspector of schools.<br>
<br>Lewis's early books, <span class="italic">Morals and the New Theology</span> (1947) and <span class="italic">Morals and Revelation</span> (1951), provided a forceful critique of the Barthian claim that mankind is utterly dependent on divine revelation for a knowledge of God and of correct moral value, and in their trenchant anti-determinism they revealed the influence of C. A. (Charles Arthur) Campbell. Lewis held the view that awareness of the divine is a basic intuition rooted in normal human experience and can be articulated by reflection upon our awareness of value, particularly moral value. He developed these ideas in what came to be perhaps his most influential book, <span class="italic">Our Experience of God</span>, published in 1959, by which time he had been appointed (in 1955) to the chair of the history and philosophy of religion at the University of London, a position which he held until he retired in 1977.<br>
<br>Lewis's later, more developed work took two directions. He became increasingly interested in the subject of experience and the nature of the self (the influence of C. A. Campbell is also seen here), and the metaphysical and religious issues are energetically set out in <span class="italic">The Self and Immortality</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">Persons and Life after Death</span> (1978). The reverse side of this was an equally vigorous polemic against the &#145;linguistic turn&#146; and the development of analytic philosophy, particularly A. J. Ayer's assault on the cognitive meaningfulness of theological language, but also on the reductionist and behaviourist account of the self which Lewis found in Gilbert Ryle's <span class="italic">The Concept of Mind</span> (1949). The nature of the mind in this broader polemical setting was the subject of his Gifford lectures delivered at Edinburgh in 1966&#150;8 and published as <span class="italic">The Elusive Mind</span> (1969) and <span class="italic">The Elusive Self</span> (1982). At this period he developed an increasing interest in comparative religion and was the founding editor of <span class="italic">Religious Studies</span> in 1964, remaining editor until 1979. He published a number of titles in Welsh. A Festschrift, <span class="italic">Religion, Reason and the Self</span>, edited by S. R. Sutherland and T. A. Roberts, was published in 1990. He received honorary degrees from the universities of St Andrews and Emery, Atlanta, and from Geneva Theological College. He was president of the Mind Association (1948&#150;9) and of the Aristotelian Society (1962&#150;3), and chairman of the council of the Royal Institute of Philosophy (1965&#150;88).<br>
<br>Lewis's editorship of the <span class="roman">Muirhead Library of Philosophy</span> (1947&#150;78) provided him with another means of combating what he regarded as the narrowness of analytic philosophy. He edited <span class="italic">Clarity is not Enough</span> in 1962. During his editorship the <span class="roman">Muirhead Library</span> published titles by a wide range of philosophers, including those of a kindred spirit of Lewis's. Dom Illtud Trethowan's <span class="italic">The Absolute and the Atonement</span> was published in the library in 1971.<br>
<br>Lewis's first wife died in 1962, and he was married again on 17 July 1965, this time to (Kate Alice) Megan Pritchard (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), superintendent of a hospital X-ray department and daughter of Thomas Owen Pritchard, a businessman. Lewis, a small, fair-haired person, could be charming, but he was also an intense and doughty defender of whatever he believed was a matter of academic principle. Although residing near London for many years he retained a commitment to the principality of Wales, especially to its dissenting tradition, and to Welsh politics. He continued to be involved in academic work in retirement, though this period was marred by severe injuries sustained when he was hit by a car. He recovered and continued active for a further seven years. He died at his home, 1 Normandy Park, Normandy, Guildford, on 6 April 1992. He was buried in the St Tudno cemetery on the Great Orme. A memorial service was held in the chapel of King's College, London, on 3 June 1992.<br>
