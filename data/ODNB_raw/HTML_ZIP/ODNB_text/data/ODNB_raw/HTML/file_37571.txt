<span class="headword">Horne,  John</span>  (1848&#150;1928), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born at Campsie, Stirlingshire, on 1 January 1848, the son of a farmer, James Horne, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Braid. He attended Glasgow high school and Glasgow University, where he studied under Lord Kelvin, but did not graduate. He left the university at the age of nineteen to take an appointment with the geological survey, where he spent his whole working life.<br>
<br>Horne's early surveying was carried out in the Silurians of the southern uplands and among the metamorphic rocks and the Old Red Sandstone country round the Moray Firth. During vacations he and other surveyors sometimes conducted independent research. For example, with his friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37839/', "Benjamin Neeve Peach")</script>, Horne worked on glacial problems in northern Scotland, and he visited the Carpathians with Robert Logan Jack. Such work could be and was published outside the official channels of the survey.<br>
<br>Horne's scientific partnership with Peach was one of the most successful in the annals of Scottish geology. In 1883 they were sent by the survey's director-general, Archibald Geikie, to examine the rocks of the north-west highlands, for which Geikie and Roderick Murchison had proposed a structure in the 1860s. This structure had been challenged by James Nicol, but the Murchison&#150;Geikie view prevailed until the early 1880s when Charles Callaway and Charles Lapworth independently arrived at alternative models that were much the same. After two seasons in the field, and influenced by his findings, Peach and Horne arrived at an interpretation similar to Lapworth's, and Geikie had to make an embarrassing climb-down. The name and reputation of the survey were subsequently restored, however, by the brilliant field mapping of Peach and Horne, who worked out the complex structures in great detail. It was Horne who first changed his mind about the &#145;official&#146; structure.<br>
<br>Peach and Horne then had to examine the rocks of the southern uplands, where the structural interpretations offered by Geikie, partly based on the fieldwork of Jack, had also been challenged by Lapworth. In the southern uplands, as in the north-west highlands, the structures were found to be much more complex than originally realized, because of repeated reverse faulting. Two large memoirs, <span class="italic">The Silurian Rocks of Britain</span>; volume 1, <span class="italic">Scotland</span> (1899) and <span class="italic">The Geological Structure of the North-West Highlands</span> (1907), gave permanent expression to the notable fieldwork of Horne and his co-workers.<br>
<br>In 1901 Horne was promoted to assistant director of the geological survey with responsibility for Scotland, in which position he served with distinction until his retirement in 1911. During this period much work was done on the Scottish coalfields. After retirement Horne was active in Edinburgh intellectual life, and he collaborated with Peach on a synthetic treatise on Scottish geology. Unfortunately, this was much delayed, as a result of disagreements (at the scientific level only) between the authors as to the origin of the &#145;Moine Schists&#146; of northern Scotland. The work eventually appeared posthumously in 1930. Besides tectonics, much of Horne's work was concerned with glaciation and relatively recent geological phenomena. He also published a significant paper with Edward Greenly on the metamorphic rocks of eastern Sutherland (1896).<br>
<br>Horne was elected FRS (1900), and received honorary degrees from Aberdeen, St Andrews, and Edinburgh. With Peach, he was awarded the Geological Society's Murchison medal (1899), and (again with Peach) the Wollaston medal (1921). Horne presided over the geological section of the British Association (1901), and was president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1915&#150;19). He was married to Anna Leyland, daughter of Henry Taylor of Pernambuco, Brazil. They had two sons and a daughter. His wife died in 1926 and Horne himself died at his home, 20 Merchiston Gardens, Edinburgh, on 30 May 1928. He was buried in Edinburgh.<br>
