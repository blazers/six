<span class="headword">Hopton, Sir  Walter  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1235&#150;1295/6), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably born in or before 1235 in Shropshire, perhaps at Hopton Castle, which his family had held since at least the mid-twelfth century as major knightly tenants of the honour of Clun. He was the son of another Walter of Hopton and his wife, Joan. The first office he is known to have held (in 1256) was the purely local one of coroner, and in 1258 he was one of the four Shropshire knights appointed to investigate grievances in the same county under the provisions of Oxford. In 1267&#150;8 he held the rather more responsible local post of sheriff of the twin counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire. By July 1270 he had been knighted.<br>
<br>Hopton's first appointment as a royal justice came at the end of Henry III's reign. In 1272 he was a justice of the general eyre in Herefordshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. In 1274 he is to be found serving as a baron of the exchequer. Later the same year he was appointed a justice of king's bench. Hopton left king's bench in 1278 to become one of the justices of a court newly established after the treaty of Aberconwy to deal with litigation from Wales and the Welsh marches. He soon become senior justice of this court. After the completion of the Edwardian conquest of Wales the legal system was recast and Hopton ceased to be involved in Welsh legal affairs.<br>
<br>In 1284 Edward I appointed Hopton to a commission sent to Ireland to audit accounts there. Hopton had previously participated in late 1278 and early 1279 in two eyres of the &#145;southern&#146; circuit of the general eyre. He rejoined the same circuit in 1285, part-way through the visitation of Essex, and remained on the circuit until eyres were suspended in 1289. Like most of his judicial colleagues he was also appointed in 1285 to a vacation assize circuit, and acted as a gaol delivery justice. In February 1290 he received appointment as one of two commissioners to hear complaints against the king's officials in London, but later the same month was himself convicted, with his colleagues in the 1286 Norfolk eyre, of judicial misconduct for failing to take appropriate action on two presentments made at the eyre. Initially Edward was unsympathetic to the petition in which Hopton claimed that at the material time he had not been serving as a justice, because of a bureaucratic muddle over his appointment, but by December 1290 the king had agreed that the money Hopton had already paid towards his fine should count instead towards a fine he had made to secure the wardship of the lands of his late wife. Hopton received no further judicial or administrative appointments from Edward.<br>
<br>With an unknown first wife Hopton had a son and heir, also named Walter. His second wife was Maud, the daughter of William Pantulf (<i>d</i>. 1233), who by the time of her own second marriage, to Walter (in 1282 or 1283), was sole heir to the Shropshire barony of Wem. There were no children of this second marriage. Hopton was still alive and engaged in litigation in Michaelmas term 1295, but dead by 28 September 1296.<br>
