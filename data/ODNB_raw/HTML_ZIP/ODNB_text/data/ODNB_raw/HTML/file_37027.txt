<span class="headword">Wormall,  Arthur</span>  (1900&#150;1964), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 17 January 1900 in Leeds, the second child in the family of two sons and two daughters of James William Wormall, a printer and lithographer, and his wife, Ann Phillis. He entered the boys' modern school, Leeds, and at seventeen was awarded a senior city scholarship to Leeds University, where he read for the honours BSc degree in chemistry under Professor J. B. Cohen. He served in the university Officers' Training Corps and joined the Royal Air Force in 1918. The end of the First World War in November allowed him to resume his degree course without any serious delay and to become engaged at the same time in his first research problem. He was also able to take up a junior appointment as demonstrator in biochemistry in the department of physiology and biochemistry at Leeds. Wormall remained at Leeds University for the next fourteen years and became lecturer (1926) and senior lecturer (1933). He was awarded the degree of DSc in 1930. Wormall married Eva Jackson in 1925; they had two daughters. In June 1928 he was elected to a Rockefeller medical research fellowship and chose to work for about a year with Karl Landsteiner at the Rockefeller Institute in New York and then at the Marine Biological Station, Woods Hole, Massachusetts.<br>
<br>After his return to England, Wormall accepted an appointment from the Colonial Office to visit Uganda to investigate some special aspects of sleeping sickness. He returned to Leeds on completing this assignment and became involved in an exacting teaching load in the physiology department. Nevertheless it was at this time that Wormall made several valuable contributions to the clarification of the nature of serum complement in terms of chemistry of the reactive components and this work stimulated many of the numerous investigations by others on this subject. He enjoyed an increasing reputation as an able investigator in immunochemistry. During this period at Leeds he also became especially interested in the action of mustard gas (di-2-chloroethyl sulphide) and related vesicants on tissue constituents.<br>
<br>In 1936 Wormall was appointed the first professor of biochemistry at St Bartholomew's Hospital medical college, London, where he spent much time launching a new department; he remained professor of biochemistry at the medical school for the rest of his life. As early as 1936 Wormall considered the possibility of using isotopic tracers and was a pioneer worker on this important aspect of immunochemistry. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Wormall moved his department from London to the Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry at Cambridge. Difficulties resulting from this move, and the heavy academic responsibilities both in London and Cambridge, considerably reduced the amount of his research; but at the war's end Wormall and his colleagues returned to London and resumed the task of developing the use of radioactive tracers in immunological investigations.<br>
<br>At the time of Wormall's return, the development in London University of a BSc (special honours) degree course, together with an extensive reorganization of his own department of biochemistry, occupied much of his time and he frequently regretted the amount of his energy that had to be given to these and other activities rather than to research. There can be no doubt, however, about the excellent advice he gave to the board of governors and college council&#151;in particular that concerning the purchase of land for future expansion of St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1949 Wormall and G. E. Francis organized a course on the use of stable isotopes in biological investigations. It was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom, proved a great success, and continued annually for fifteen years. In 1952 Wormall was invited by the University of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, to organize the first Latin-American course in radioisotopes and his success was recognized in 1953 by the conferment on him of a doctorate <i>honoris causa</i>.<br>
<br>Although always busy, Wormall was never too occupied to help others. In spite of failing health and long periods in hospital, he remained cheerful and full of hope. In December 1955 he suffered a cerebral thrombosis which kept him away from his work for nearly a year. After a brief return to the department he had a further stroke in April 1962 and from then on he was completely paralysed until he died in St Bartholomew's Hospital on 9 May 1964.<br>
<br>As a Yorkshireman and therefore a cricketer, Wormall was probably as pleased by his election to the MCC as he was by his election to the Royal Society, both in 1956.<br>
