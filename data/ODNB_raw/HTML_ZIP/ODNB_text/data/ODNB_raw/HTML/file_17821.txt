<span class="headword">Maitland,  Edward Francis</span>, Lord Barcaple  (1808&#150;1870), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 16 April 1808 in Edinburgh, the fifth son of Adam Maitland (<i>d</i>. 1843), landed proprietor, of Dundrennan, Kirkcudbrightshire, and his wife, Stewart McWhann. He was educated at the high school and then the University of Edinburgh and was called to the Scottish bar in March 1831. His eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17836/', "Thomas Maitland (1792&#150;1851)")</script>, also entered the legal profession, rising, as Lord Dundrennan, to be a court of session judge.<br>
<br>Initially Edward was not very successful as an advocate and considered giving up the profession. He had the advantage of family connections, but was apparently gruff and unwilling to flatter or hide contempt. Although never entirely briefless, he had spare time which he spent on literature. He was one of the originators of the Free Church periodical the <span class="italic">North British Review</span>, contributed several articles to it, and was its editor for a time in 1845 and 1846.<br>
<br>On 21 July 1840 Maitland married Anne Roberts (1813&#150;1854), daughter of William Roberts, a banker in Glasgow. Together they had a family of four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>A change in the tempo of Maitland's legal career began with his appointment as an advocate-depute in 1847. Maitland came from a whig background, his brother Thomas was MP for Kirkcudbrightshire from 1845 until 1850, and this and his later appointments were made by whig administrations. He was appointed sheriff of Argyll in July 1851 and was solicitor-general for Scotland between 1855 and 1858 and again from 1859 until 1862. Especially as holder of the latter office, he was able to build a reputation for conscientiousness and as an earnest and persuasive pleader, though his oratory was not of the kind to attract popular attention. Most notable in bringing Maitland to public attention was probably his conduct, together with the lord advocate James Moncreiff, of the prosecution at the famous trial of Madeleine Smith for murder in 1857. His humour was reportedly subtle and his intellect had a tendency to over-refinement and rigidity. These flaws, however, did not prevent him eventually enjoying a large income at the bar.<br>
<br>Maitland was not attracted by a political career. It was said he would have objected to exercising patronage according to the needs of party rather than in line with his conscience. This aversion did not extend, however, to university politics. After holding office as curator and assessor at Edinburgh University and being awarded an LLD in 1860, Maitland was elected in the same year as the first rector of Aberdeen University, newly created as a result of the union of King's and Marischal colleges. Maitland was put up as the &#145;peace candidate&#146; in a bitterly contested election overshadowed by the quarrel between supporters and opponents of the union.<br>
<br>In November 1862 Maitland accepted a position as one of the judges of the outer house of the court of session. He took the title Lord Barcaple from a property he had recently purchased from a brother near Dundrennan, the family estate in Kirkcudbrightshire. Reportedly, he soon regretted this step. On the bench his income was significantly reduced and the conscientious thoroughness which had seen him overworked as solicitor-general was to have fatal consequences when he was a judge. The rule in Scottish courts that a litigant could choose the lord ordinary before whom a case was to be heard meant that a popular judge attracted a lot of business. Maitland's occasional tendency to miss the plain view of a case, the result of characteristic over-refinement, did not help and his roll became longer than he could manage. In addition, he was appointed a commissioner on the courts of law in 1868, and the government failed to fill a vacant chair on the court of session. This workload led to a breakdown in his health at the end of 1869, from which he did not recover. Barcaple died at his Edinburgh residence, 3 Ainslie Place, on 23 February 1870 and was buried on 28 February in the Dean cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
