<span class="headword">Stephenson,  Samuel Martin</span>  (1742&#150;1833), <span class="occ">physician and minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster</span>, was born at Straidballymorris, in the parish of Templepatrick, co. Antrim, the third and youngest son of James Stephenson, a farmer, and his wife, Margaret Martin. Educated at the school of John Rankin, Presbyterian minister at Antrim, in 1763 he went to Glasgow University, where he studied under William Leechman and attended lectures given by Adam Smith and Thomas Reid. Having been licensed in 1767 by Templepatrick presbytery he taught in the diocesan school at Monaghan. In August 1773 he received a call from the congregation of Greyabbey, co. Down. His trial sermon, preached on 19 April 1774, raised suspicions about his orthodoxy that were confirmed by his refusal to subscribe to the Westminster confession. Several ministers objected to his appointment, and on 31 May he was admitted to ordination by a majority of one only after his supporters had threatened to join either the Southern Association or the presbytery of Antrim. He was ordained by the Bangor presbytery on 21 June; those of his congregation who opposed his ordination seceded and formed the presbytery of Antrim. Stephenson justified his non-subscribing position in two pamphlets that were published in Belfast, in 1774 and 1775.<br>
<br>At Monaghan, Stephenson had lodged for two years with an apothecary named Braddock, and this had persuaded him to study medicine at Dublin and Edinburgh universities. On 12 June 1776 he graduated MD from Edinburgh University, after defending a thesis on typhus, and returned to Greyabbey to practise on a salary of &pound;50 in addition to his ministerial stipend from the <i>regium donum</i>. On 1 August 1785 he resigned his charge and was succeeded by James Porter. He settled in Belfast, where he gained a considerable reputation as a physician, especially for his treatment of fever cases. In conjunction with James McDonnell MD he founded the city's first dispensary in 1792 and the fever hospital in 1797. A member of the Belfast Literary Society, he also helped found the Linenhall Library and the Academical Institution (later Royal Academical Institution), which opened on 1 February 1814. In 1808 he published a paper that he had written for the literary society on the Belfast linen industry, and wrote brief histories of the parishes of Templepatrick and Greyabbey, published respectively in 1825 and 1828. In recognition of his charitable works the General Synod of Ulster reinstated his name on the ministerial roll, though he had exercised no clerical duties for over thirty years.<br>
<br>Stephenson married Mary, the daughter of James Armstrong (1739&#150;1779), Presbyterian minister of Portaferry, co. Down. They had at least four sons&#151;James Armstrong (<i>d</i>. 1839), Samuel Martin (<i>d</i>. 1834), George Alexander (<i>d</i>. 1864), and Robert (<i>d</i>. 1869)&#151;two of whom, Samuel Martin and Robert, qualified as doctors of medicine. In 1821 Stephenson resigned his public offices in favour of his son Robert and pursued farming in retirement. He died on 13 January 1833.<br>
