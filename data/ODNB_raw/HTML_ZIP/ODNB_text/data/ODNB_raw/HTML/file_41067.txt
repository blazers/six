<span class="headword">Helena, Princess</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein]</span>  (1846&#150;1923), <span class="occ"></span>was born Helena Augusta Victoria in London at Buckingham Palace on 25 May 1846, the third daughter and fifth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36652/', "Queen Victoria")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/274/', "Prince Albert")</script>. Her pet name in the family throughout her life was Lenchen. A lively child, fearless and inclined to be a tomboy, she tended to quell any brotherly teasing with a swift punch on the nose and gained a reputation for being lively, outspoken, and awkward. Countess Bl&uuml;cher, a close friend of the family, once regretted that &#145;She is wanting in <i>charm</i>&#146;  (Battiscombe, 76). Like her sisters she was educated at home, and studied history, modern languages, and domestic arts.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1866 Helena married Prince (Frederick) Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1831&#150;1917), in the private royal chapel at Windsor, Berkshire. At first they made their home at Frogmore House, Windsor&#151;a gift from Queen Victoria&#151;and they then moved to Cumberland Lodge nearby, six years later. After the queen's death in 1901 they were also given a London residence, Schomberg House, in Pall Mall.<br>
<br>The eldest of their five children, Prince Christian Victor (1867&#150;1900), was the first member of the royal family to attend school (Wellington College) instead of being educated privately by a tutor at home. He served with the army in the Asante kingdom and in the South African War, and died of enteric fever at Pretoria. Their second son, Prince Albert (1869&#150;1931), was brought up in Germany as heir to the duchy of Schleswig-Holstein; he was obliged to enter the German army, though his refusal to fight against his mother's country during the First World War was respected. The third son, Harold, born in 1876, lived for only eight days. Their daughters <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33802/', "Princess Helena Victoria (1870&#150;1948)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34875/', "Princess Marie Louise (1872&#150;1956)")</script> both supported their parents tirelessly in their charity work in hospitals and the Young Women's Christian Association. Marie Louise was the only child to marry, but her childless union in 1891 with Prince Aribert of Anhalt was dissolved in 1900.<br>
<br>Helena devoted much time and effort to charitable causes. She set up and helped to supervise a holiday house for deprived and handicapped London children near Cumberland Lodge, and she was a founder member of the Red Cross. Her daughters helped to roll bandages for the wounded of the Russo-Turkish War in 1877, and she was active in voluntary work during the First World War. In 1872 she became founding president of the School of Art Needlework, later the Royal School of Needlework, set up to provide employment for women. For some years she was president of the Royal British Nurses' Association, in which capacity she was bold enough to go against the advice of Florence Nightingale. She actively supported the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children; was for years a regular district visitor in the parish of Holy Trinity, Windsor; and took a keen interest in the Eton Mission at Hackney Wick, east London. On one occasion she enjoined a meeting of the Ladies' Association for the Care of Friendless Girls not to defer to her&#151;&#145;you must try not to mind me at all&#146;  (Prochaska, 115)&#151;but she was far from being a background presence in her endeavours and presided over committee meetings with a sense of leadership that befitted Queen Victoria's daughter.<br>
<br>In 1884 Helena wrote a foreword to an edition of the letters to Queen Victoria of her late sister Alice, grand duchess of Hesse and by Rhine (1843&#150;1878), prefaced with a biographical sketch by Dr Karl Sell. A revised edition was published in 1885 in which Sell's text was replaced by a memoir of Alice by Helena herself. Some three years later she translated and wrote an introduction to a new edition of the memoirs of Wilhelmina, margravine of Bayreuth, sister of Frederick the Great, and also in due course an edition of the margravine's correspondence with Voltaire. She loved music and was an accomplished pianist; as a girl she had played duets with the conductor and pianist Charles Hall&eacute;, and artists such as Jenny Lind and Clara Butt were among her personal friends.<br>
<br>In appearance Helena was plump and dowdy. Placid, level-headed, and businesslike in personality, her somewhat authoritarian spirit was tempered by sound common sense. During a national dock strike the archbishop of Canterbury composed a prayer of intercession, to be read in every church, that the dispute might be settled. At a service in Windsor Chapel one Sunday she picked up the leaflet from her pew, examined it carefully, and put it down, remarking&#151;in what her daughter Marie Louise described as &#145;the penetrating Royal Family whisper, which carried farther than any megaphone&#146;&#151;&#145;That prayer won't settle any strike&#146;  (Princess Marie Louise, 17).<br>
<br>Helena and Christian celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in July 1916&#151;remarkably, in view of the fifteen years' age difference between them&#151;and she was the only child of Queen Victoria to enjoy such an achievement. Although Britain and Germany had been at war for nearly two years, she was delighted to receive a congratulatory telegram from her nephew Kaiser Wilhelm II, passed to them through their niece Margaret, crown princess of Sweden. Christian died on 28 October 1917. Shortly after her seventy-seventh birthday Helena fell ill with influenza, and died at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923. She was buried in the Albert Memorial Chapel at Windsor on 15 June.<br>
