<span class="headword">Osborne, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1592), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was one of the four children of Richard Osborne, of Ashford, Kent, and his wife, Jane, the daughter of John Broughton. Both parents probably came from minor gentry families, although Richard is described only as a yeoman in his son's apprenticeship records.<h2>
<a name="WilliamHewettsapprenticeandheir"></a>William Hewett's apprentice and heir</h2>His father's lands at Ashford passed to another son, Thomas, while Edward was apprenticed in 1544 or 1545 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13145/', "William Hewett")</script>, master of the Clothworkers' Company. Hewett was an overseas merchant whose premises included The Rose in Fish Street on the approach to London Bridge, and the story was preserved in the Hewett and Osborne families that the young apprentice made his fortune by leaping gallantly into the Thames to save his master's little daughter when a careless maid let her fall in. Between 1560 and 1562 he married Anne Hewett (1543/4&#150;1585), by then the only child of the wealthy lord mayor. The romantic tale of the rescue and their courtship was first published in 1720 by John Strype: &#145;Sir William was pleased to say, Osborn saved her, and Osborn should enjoy her&#146;  (Stow, 2.v.133&#150;4), and became the subject of a popular Victorian novel, <span class="italic">The Colloquies of Edward Osborne</span> by Anne Manning.<br>
<br>Hewett died in 1567, leaving the Osbornes heirs partly by settlement and partly by bequest to the greater part of his real and personal estate, although his nephew and partner Henry Hewett was left his main business premises at the Three Cranes in Candlewick Street. Anne and Edward Osborne acquired the Fish Street premises, a mansion house with adjoining buildings in Philpot Lane, The Crown in Fenchurch Street, and other London properties, as well as extensive estates in Hewett's native Yorkshire and nearby parts of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. The lands in the southern tip of the West Riding&#151;at Harthill, Thorpe Salvin, Todwick, Waleswood, Woodall, and Woodsetts&#151;and adjacent lands at Killamarsh, Derbyshire, would later form the nucleus of the Kiveton estate of the dukes of Leeds. The manor of Parsloes in Dagenham, Essex, where the Osbornes built themselves a country house, was not (as often stated) inherited from Hewett, but bought several years after his death from another master of the Clothworkers' Company, Sir Rowland Hayward, and Thomas Wilbraham.<h2>
<a name="Citypolitics"></a>City politics</h2>Osborne had become a freeman of the Clothworkers' Company in 1553, a week after Queen Mary's accession. He then disappears from the record for the rest of her reign. He took his own first apprentice in 1559, was admitted to the livery in 1560, and was elected steward in 1562 and a warden in 1565 and 1569, but rather surprisingly never went on to serve as master, although he remained closely associated with the company and left money for a memorial dinner to be held there after his death. Instead he sought city office, and served as alderman for Castle Baynard ward (1573&#150;6) and Candlewick ward (from 1576), sheriff (1575&#150;6), and lord mayor (1583&#150;4; he was knighted on 2 February 1584). He was also MP for London in the parliament of 1586, where the only record of his activity is as a member of the committee attending the queen to present reasons for executing Mary, queen of Scots. From 1586 until his death he was president of St Thomas's Hospital (having been treasurer in 1571&#150;3), and from 1590 surveyor-general of hospitals. From 1587 he was a commissioner of sewers for the River Lea.<br>
<br>Osborne was also called on by the privy council to arbitrate in disputes concerning the wholesale cloth trade, maritime insurance, foreign contracts, patent infringements, and the mining industry (he had his own coal pit in Yorkshire). He was evidently regarded as a fair-minded man, in spite of occasional accusations of sharp practice. In 1566 he was indicted in the court of exchequer, together with a broker married to Lady Hewett's sister, for fraudulent conveyancing designed to circumvent the laws against usury, but the case was dismissed for lack of evidence. After this he was careful only to lend at interest if repayment was in another currency, when it was legitimate to charge a fee for money-changing. This made him unpopular with acquaintances such as the earl of Shrewsbury and his family, who expected an interest-free loan of ready money and were offered instead an expensive bill of exchange payable in Antwerp. And even internationally agreed loans could give rise to prolonged disputes, as Osborne and other lenders discovered when a debt incurred in 1561&#150;2 by the Swedish ambassador Guildenstern was later disowned by the Swedish king's usurping brother.<br>
<br>It was probably characteristic that Osborne made interest-free loans to close relatives but recorded them all in a ledger. At his death he subtracted from their legacies the small sums owed by his two brothers, his brother-in-law, and a cousin. Humane views, however, emerge in connection with the education of his sons. Both were sent to learn Latin and Greek at the boarding-school kept by Elias Newcomen and went on to Cambridge and the Inner Temple. In a testimonial written in 1586 for Newcomen when he applied for a post at Merchant Taylors' School, Osborne not only praised the schoolmaster's &#145;skill and longe Experience in teachinge&#146;, his being of a sincere religion, &#145;a thinge in a teacher muche to be respected&#146;, and his daily catechism of the children in the same, but also &#145;the great Lenitie and gentlenes which he useth towardes his schollers&#146;  (Merchant Taylors' Company, court minutes, vol. 3, fol. 149). Osborne's closest personal friend was not another businessman but the deputy recorder of London, William Daniell, a man with a reputation for learning and wisdom who was later knighted and made a justice of the common pleas.<h2>
<a name="Tradingactivities"></a>Trading activities</h2>It was as a merchant, however, that Osborne made his own reputation. The first surviving record of his trading activities is in 1559, when he exported thirteen unfinished cloths to Antwerp. He must therefore have belonged then to the Company of Merchant Adventurers, but he had ceased to be actively involved by the time they were incorporated in 1564 and fell out with the Clothworkers' Company in 1565&#150;6. Instead he became a pioneer in sending to more distant outlets cloths and kerseys which had been dyed and dressed in England. The port books show that from 1567 to 1577 he exported these mainly to Spain and Portugal, importing in exchange oil and raisins from Spain, spices from Portugal, and wine, vinegar, and canvas from France. When he used a partner it was at first his brother-in-law Lawrence Mellowe, a clothworker married to his sister Julian or Gillian. Later it was Mellowe's regular partner, Richard Staper, a younger clothworker who joined the family in 1567 by marrying Henry Hewett's sister Dionis. In 1577 Osborne and Staper were both named as assistants in the charter of the new Company of Spain and Portugal. In 1578 they were the first merchants to be approached with a project to open up the trade with Brazil. In 1579 Osborne's name was the first of sixty-five in the charter of the Eastland Company, the new regulated company granted a monopoly of much of the Baltic trade, with Staper another charter member, and within a few months they exported cloths and kerseys worth over &pound;1000 to Danzig. The Russia Company became another interest; in 1584 Osborne was the first signatory of a petition from Muscovy House demanding reimbursement of sums laid out by the company for Sir Jerome Bowes during his embassy to Russia.<br>
<br>Above all Osborne is to be credited with the revival of direct trade on a large scale between England and the Levant. Antwerp had been the entrep&ocirc;t in recent decades for Levant goods, but was in decline by the 1570s; the Turks, after Lepanto, were desperate for English tin and lead, and they represented a huge potential market for English cloth. Osborne and Staper seized this favourable conjunction by sending out to Constantinople through Poland in 1575 two agents who procured a safe conduct for a more substantial emissary, William Harborne. Osborne had obtained his freedom of the Clothworkers' Company and subsequently employed him in Spain. Now unofficially backed by the English government as well as the merchants, he arrived in Constantinople late in 1578 and within a few months had persuaded the sultan to write to Queen Elizabeth offering security of trade to all her subjects. This was not what Osborne and Staper had had in mind. By the time the letter's Latin translation reached the queen, crucial phrases had been rewritten to convert it into a monopoly for themselves and Harborne. The queen then replied asking for the privileges to be extended to all her nationals, and the Turks responded in 1580 by issuing a more specific charter of liberties, which became the model for all later renewals of the capitulations under which the English continued to trade in the Ottoman empire until 1923. The enterprise was nearly sabotaged at the outset by French machinations and English piracy, but the Turks accepted Elizabeth's apology for the latter and allowed Harborne to return as a fully accredited ambassador. As was to remain the pattern for two centuries, he acted both as the crown's representative and as the salaried agent of the London merchants granted the monopoly of the trade. These were led by Osborne, who was named in the Turkey Company's charter of September 1581 as its governor for the seven years of its monopoly, &#145;in consideration that the said Edward Osborne hath bene the principall setter foorth and doer in the opening and putting in use of the said trade&#146;. He was given wide powers over the company, which was known to the customs as Edward Osborne, Richard Staper &amp; Co., and traded from his own premises in Philpot Lane. At his death it was still paying him &pound;20 a year to store its bulky bales in &#145;certayne warehouses, vaults and chambers&#146; attached to his mansion. Nevertheless it was no family business, but was conceived from the outset on the grand scale required for success. The heavy initial outlay was subsidized in part by a loan of 10,000 lb in silver from the queen&#151;the New World fuelling development of the Old&#151;and contributions to the joint stock were broadly based. Consulates were quickly established in Chios, Tripoli in Syria, Alexandria, Algiers, and Patras, and soon convoys of richly laden English merchantmen had become a familiar sight in the eastern Mediterranean. The main exports were cloth and tin, the main imports raw silk, cotton yarn and cotton wool, grograms and camlets (mohair/silk and mohair fabrics respectively), carpets, currants, galls, and a wide range of spices and drugs. This was to remain the basic pattern of the Levant trade until the nineteenth century.<h2>
<a name="ExpansionoftheLevanttrade"></a>Expansion of the Levant trade</h2>Within a generation this influx of raw material was to revolutionize the silk and cotton manufacturing industries in England. In the 1580s these were still in their infancy, and there was therefore a large re-export trade in Levant goods for which there was as yet no home market. This in turn encouraged further expansion, in which Osborne and Staper again played a leading part. They exported Cretan wine via London to the Baltic. They took advantage of the detention of their ship the <i>Bark Reynolds</i> at Malta on its way back from Syria in 1582 to negotiate a trading agreement there, together with the use of Maltese harbour facilities on the Levant voyage. They re-exported opium, mastic, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth to the Barbary coast, Osborne using Harborne's influence at the Porte to try to secure a friendly reception from the Ottoman regencies of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, while Staper was heavily involved in the earl of Leicester's partnership trading to Morocco. And Osborne had for some time been looking further east. With Mellowe and others he imported &pound;1437 worth of East India goods in the <i>Mildred</i> from Bombay in 1575. He sponsored John Newbery's expedition to Persia in 1580&#150;82, as well as the longer exploration of the land route to the East Indies undertaken by Newbery between 1583 and 1591, partly in the company of Ralph Fitch and John Eldred. Eldred returned from Syria in 1588 in the <i>Hercules</i>, billed (with some justice) as &#145;the richest ship of English merchants' goods that ever was known to come into this realm&#146; by the Turkey Company's invaluable publicist Richard Hakluyt, for whom Osborne and Staper had secured the award and continuation of a Clothworkers' exhibition at Oxford. This success was well timed. The Venice Company, which controlled the valuable trade in currants, wine, and oil with the Ionian Islands and the Morea, was already co-operating with the Turkey Company in freighting ships to the Levant, and when the charters of the two companies expired close together in 1588&#150;9 their members quickly agreed to seek a new combined charter as Merchants of the Levant.<br>
<br>This was issued on 7 January 1592. From this time in practice a regulated company, not a joint stock, the Levant Company was granted a twelve-year monopoly of trade with the Venetian and the Ottoman dominions, and also with the vast territories on the land route to the East Indies, although these were transferred eight years later to the first East India Company. Osborne, who was again named as governor (for the first year) in the charter, might well be regarded as the founding father of both great national enterprises. He had certainly earned the tribute paid by the Levant Company's historian A. C. Wood: &#145;With argosies on all the seas and ventures in every clime he was in fact the prototype of the merchant prince of the modern world.&#146;<h2>
<a name="Deathandsuccession"></a>Death and succession</h2>Osborne died just four weeks later, in London on 4 February 1592. He was buried on 15 February at St Dionis Backchurch, where a monument was erected near his usual seat, as requested in his will. This was written on 18 January, properly witnessed on the 20th (by the future ambassador Henry Lello, among others), and cited in the inquisitions post mortem carried out in York and London, as well as in his son's will seven years later. Two fair copies survive among the family papers in Leeds, one annotated by a lawyer. Nevertheless there is no record of probate in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury or any other likely court. Unless this was a simple clerical error, the explanation may be connected with Osborne's second marriage.<br>
<br>Anne Osborne had died in 1585, leaving five children&#151;Alice, Hewett, Anne, Edward, and Jane&#151;who all survived to marry and have children. On 15 September 1588 Sir Edward Osborne married secondly, at St Dionis Backchurch, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1554&#150;1602), the daughter and coheir of Charles Pratt, citizen and leatherseller, and the widow firstly of John Midleton, citizen and merchant tailor, and secondly of Edmond Chapman, squire joiner to Queen Elizabeth and yeoman of the royal armouries at Greenwich. She already had three sons and three daughters from her first marriage and a son from her second (and was to have two more daughters from her fourth), but had none from her marriage to Osborne. She had inherited a third of her father's moveable property and of his substantial real estate in Southwark and Lambeth, and both her husbands had left her a life interest in their own leasehold and freehold property, as well as being generous with their moveable estate. Osborne followed their example by settling the Philpot Lane houses on her for life a fortnight before their marriage. In his will he confirmed this and also left her a life interest in other London and Essex properties in lieu of dower, including the Fish Street premises, now called the Rose and Pomegranate. His eldest son inherited the northern estates, but burdened with an annuity of &pound;63, which Osborne calculated would bring his widow's total income from his estate up to &pound;200. By the custom of London she also received a third of his moveable property. His three &#145;unadvanced&#146; children&#151;Hewett, Edward, and Jane&#151;received another third (Alice and Anne had been well dowered on marriage and were left only silver dishes), and the remaining third was to be divided in equal fourths between his widow and the three unadvanced children. After Margaret's death Hewett Osborne was to have all the real property held by her except Philpot Lane; the reversion of this was to be sold immediately after Osborne's death, and the proceeds divided among all five children. Although the three eldest were over twenty-one, their stepmother was named as sole executor for the third time. Osborne's cousin Edward Osborne of the Inner Temple was to give her legal assistance in return for a &pound;50 legacy, and William Daniell, Richard Staper, and Osborne's Levant merchant son-in-law Robert Offley were named as overseers.<br>
<br>None of this depended on Margaret's continued widowhood, and she lost no time in marrying again, on 10 April 1592 at St Dionis Backchurch, as his third wife, Robert Clarke, of Pleshey, Essex, a baron of the exchequer. Later deeds and wills suggest that a deal was eventually made with her stepchildren whereby she dropped most of her other claims on the estate in exchange for having her interest in the Philpot Lane property extended from life to 1900 years. After her death in 1602 her interest was inherited by Sir Robert Clarke, who brought his fourth wife to live there.<br>
<br>This arrangement allowed the Osbornes to consolidate their estates elsewhere, especially after the Essex lands were sold by Hewett Osborne's son Edward, the first baronet, to finance further purchases in Yorkshire. In the next generation the rapid rise through the peerage of Sir Edward Osborne's great-grandson Thomas Osborne, first duke of Leeds, was made possible not only by his own abilities and opportunities but also by the foresight of ancestors who had built up an estate capable of supporting a dynasty. Like the Levant Company, the dukedom was to survive for a quarter of a millennium.<br>
