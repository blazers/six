<span class="headword">Blake,  George</span>  (1893&#150;1961), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 28 October 1893 at 60 Forsyth Street, Greenock, Renfrewshire, the fourth child of Matthew Blake, manufacturer of sugar machinery, and his wife, Ursula Scott McCulloch. He was educated at Greenock Academy and studied law at Glasgow University until the outbreak of the First World War. He served in the forces and was wounded at Gallipoli. After the war he entered journalism and wrote for the Glasgow <span class="italic">Evening News</span>, then edited by the novelist Neil Munro. He married Eliza (Ellie) Malcolm Lawson in 1923, and they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1924 Blake moved to London, where he edited two literary magazines and in 1930 became a director of the publisher Faber and Faber. He was involved in running the Porpoise Press, Edinburgh (which published Neil M. Gunn's <span class="italic">Morning Tide</span> in 1931) as a subsidiary of Faber. He returned to Scotland in 1932 and lived successively in Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Dollar, Clackmannanshire, and Glasgow.<br>
<br>Blake wrote more than twenty novels and many non-fiction works. The autobiographical <span class="italic">Down to the Sea</span> (1937) demonstrated his lifelong interest in the Clyde and its shipping. His melodramatic first novel, <span class="italic">Mince Collop Close</span> (1923), preceded more mature work in <span class="italic">Young Malcolm</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">The Path of Glory</span> (1929), which drew on his First World War experiences. <span class="italic">The Shipbuilders</span> (1935), which contrasts the fates of a shipowner and a manual worker during the depression on Clydeside, attracted much attention and was filmed, although some later critics detect a patronizing attitude towards its working-class characters. Blake himself came to believe that he &#145;had failed with his proletarians &hellip; and found his right subject among the <i>bourgeoisie</i>&#146;  (Blake, 32) when he went on to write a popular series of novels set in Garvel, a fictionalized Greenock. <span class="italic">Late Harvest</span> (1938) is also set during the depression years, while <span class="italic">The Constant Star</span> (1945) and <span class="italic">The Westering Sun</span> (1946) depict the rise and fall of middle-class shipbuilding and shipowning dynasties. The Garvel novels are accurate in historical and social detail, but have not generally been highly regarded as works of literature.<br>
<br>Blake, described as &#145;a thickset, battering-ram of a man, with a frowning brow and unruly hair&#146;  (Reid), was a frequent radio broadcaster and published much literary journalism. He assessed the Scottish kailyard school generously but honestly in <span class="italic">Barrie and the Kailyard School</span> (1951). His death from a cerebral haemorrhage in the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, on 29 August 1961 was followed by a private funeral. His wife survived him.<br>
