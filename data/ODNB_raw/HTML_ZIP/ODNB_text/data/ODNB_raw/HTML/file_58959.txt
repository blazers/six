<span class="headword">Briggs,  Katharine Mary</span>  (1898&#150;1980), <span class="occ">writer and folklorist</span>, was born on 8 November 1898 at 102 Fellows Road, Hampstead, eldest daughter of Ernest Edward Briggs (1866&#150;1913) and his wife, Mary Cooper (1867&#150;1956). Her father belonged to a wealthy Unitarian family in Yorkshire, engaged in mining, banking, and various industrial enterprises; he made an unconventional but happy marriage with a farmer's daughter. After a serious illness at sixteen he had given up a career in the family firm for the Slade School of Art, and become a distinguished landscape painter. When Katharine was twelve they moved from London to a beautiful house, Dalbeathie, built by Ernest above the River Tay near Dunkeld, Perthshire. It was filled with books and pictures, and a constant stream of guests, mostly artists and writers, came to stay.<br>
<br>Katharine and her two sisters, Winifred and Elspeth, had an idyllic childhood, and she gained her love of folk-tales, local traditions, and storytelling from an early age, encouraged by her father. But he died when she was fourteen, and they were left somewhat isolated. Katharine went to school (Lansdowne House) in Edinburgh and then to Oxford to read English at Lady Margaret Hall, taking her degree in 1921. She returned to Dalbeathie to devote herself to her family, and the sisters worked at writing and art, Winifred producing some of their work on a small printing press. Katharine and Elspeth collected rare books on the seventeenth century, and wrote historical novels. They worked with Guides and Brownies, and Katharine became interested in story-telling, mimes, and plays for children, and invited Guide and Brownie leaders and others to the house for dramatic work. She developed a touring company called the Summer Players, rehearsing at Dalbeathie and giving performances in remote places far from theatres. Her own plays, along with ballads and folk-songs, were included in the repertory. In 1939 the family bought a house in the Cotswolds as a more accessible centre, but the outbreak of war changed everything.<br>
<br>Evacuees came to Dalbeathie, which Winifred ran almost single-handed, while Elspeth trained as a draughtsman in London, and Katharine shocked her friends by joining the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in 1941 as an ordinary recruit. She worked as a nursing orderly, a great contrast to the privileged existence she had led hitherto, but she gained from contacts with a wider world, and made many friends. She attained the rank of lance air corporal, and as time went on she was able to organize plays and entertainments, write poems, and plan books.<br>
<br>After the war she moved into the Barn House in Burford and set about making it habitable, while planning to do research in seventeenth-century literature at Oxford. She had become fascinated by the rich variety of fairy characters when working with Brownies, and had written a small book, <span class="italic">The Personnel of Fairyland</span>, published in 1953. Ethel Seaton, her sympathetic and inspiring supervisor, encouraged her to work on beliefs in the supernatural in seventeenth-century literature, and she achieved her doctorate in 1952. After her mother's death in 1956 Dalbeathie was sold, and Elspeth and Winifred moved to the Barn House.<br>
<br>Once more they took up dramatic work, with memorable Shakespeare productions in their garden, and plays in Burford church; Katharine had now become a loyal member of the Church of England. She had support from Faith Spachman (later Sharp), a gifted musician; they tried to establish an arts centre, but had to be satisfied with the rebuilding of the parish hall.<br>
<br>Katharine's work at Oxford resulted in two important books, <span class="italic">The Anatomy of Puck: an Examination of Fairy Beliefs among Shakespeare's Contemporaries and Successors</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">Pale Hecate's Team</span> (1961), on magic and witchcraft. She also published <span class="italic">Hobberdy Dick</span> (1955), a delightful tale for children set in the Cotswolds in Tudor times with a household brownie as the main character, and <span class="italic">Kate Crackernuts</span> (1963), a powerful and moving story of witchcraft based on a folk-tale, begun during the war. <span class="italic">The Fairies in Tradition and Literature</span> (1967) dealt with recent fairy traditions, and included a list of fairy beings, as did the earlier <span class="italic">Personnel of Fairyland</span>; out of these her enormously popular <span class="italic">Dictionary of Fairies</span> (1976) developed. But for ten years she was working on a more ambitious project, a <span class="italic">Dictionary of English Folktales</span>, in four massive volumes; the manuscript was duly delivered to Routledge and Kegan Paul on the appointed day, and published in 1970&#150;71. Katharine was elected to the council of the London Folklore Society in 1961, and was an extremely successful president from 1967 to 1970, doing much to rebuild the society at a crucial time in its history.<br>
<br>Now, however, Katharine's life had become difficult. Two accidents left her seriously lame; Elspeth, to whom she was devoted, had died in 1961, and Winifred in 1966, and she could no longer manage alone. Then in 1975, when staying with a relative in Dover, she made a new friend in Katharine Law, and moved to St Margaret's Bay to live with her and Dr Carol Duff. She was nursed back to health and her remaining years were filled with happy activities. She made visits to America, where she was immensely popular, proved an excellent broadcaster, and published several popular books on folk-tales and fairy lore, while her work was translated into various languages including Japanese. Katharine was a woman of great charm, making friends everywhere and holding audiences enthralled by her story-telling. Her life was full and serene until her sudden death at her home, Southolme, Sea View Road, St Margaret's Bay, on 15 October 1980. Her ashes were buried at the church of St John the Baptist, Burford. Her portrait, painted by John Ward, was exhibited that year at the Royal Academy. The Folklore Society sponsors an annual Katharine Briggs lecture, while the Katharine Briggs Club, an interdisciplinary group, holds regular meetings and conferences. The Katharine Briggs Trust is now being set up to promote publication and research.<br>
