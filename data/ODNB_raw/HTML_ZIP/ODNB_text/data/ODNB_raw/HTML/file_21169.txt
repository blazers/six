<span class="headword">Palliser, Sir  William</span>  (1830&#150;1882), <span class="occ">army officer and engineer</span>, was the fifth and youngest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Wray Palliser (<i>d</i>. 1862) of the Waterford militia and Anne Gledstanes of co. Tipperary. He was born in Dublin on 18 June 1830, and was educated at Rugby School (1845&#150;9), Trinity College, Dublin, from 1849, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, from 1851. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1854, after which he went on to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, obtaining a commission as ensign in the rifle brigade on 22 April 1855. In the same year he became lieutenant and joined the 1st battalion in the Crimea, but saw no active service, returning to England in June 1856. In 1858 he exchanged into the 18th hussars, and on 5 August 1859 was promoted to the rank of captain. He then served as aide-de-camp to Sir William Knollys at Aldershot for a time, before going to Dublin as brigade major of cavalry on 6 July 1860. He remained there until 4 October 1864, when he accepted an unattached majority, finally retiring from the army in December 1871.<br>
<br>Palliser is chiefly remembered for his innovations in ordnance, and it was while still an undergraduate at Cambridge that he first turned his mind in that direction. Some shot of his design was tested at Shoeburyness in 1853, followed by a rifled mortar in 1855, and he took out a patent for projectiles as early as 20 July 1854. However, it was in 1862 and 1863 that he developed the three inventions that proved most fruitful, and with which his name is chiefly identified. The first of these, entitled &#145;Improvements in the construction of ordnance and in the projectiles to be used therewith&#146;, was granted a patent on 11 November 1862. The essential problem that this patent attempted to address was the propensity of cannon and other artillery to explode unexpectedly when placed under the severe stress produced when they were fired. The solution Palliser offered was to form the barrels of such cannon from concentric tubes of metal of different elasticities, so that, as he explained in the patent, &#145;owing to their respective ranges of elasticity, when one tube is on the point of yielding, all the tubes may be on the point of yielding&#146;. One application of this principle was to insert tubes of coiled wrought iron into cast-iron guns that had been suitably bored out. Guns so treated were found, when tested, to give excellent results, and the method provided an efficient means of utilizing the large stockpile of cast-iron smooth-bore ordnance. It became possible to convert 68-pounder smooth-bore guns into 80-pounder rifled guns, and 8 inch and 32-pounder smooth-bores into rifled 64-pounders, at one-third of the cost of new guns. Some thousands were altered in this way, and became known as &#145;Palliser converted guns&#146;.<br>
<br>On 6 December 1862, Palliser took out a patent for screw-bolts, the second invention for which he was known. The stem or shank of these bolts was designed so as to be slightly smaller in diameter than the bottom of the thread of the screw in order to cause any extension in the shank to be confined to the screwed part, resulting in an increase in the strain they could take before breaking. This was especially intended for the bolts used in securing armour-plates, and the principle proved so effective that Palliser bolts, even without elastic washers, were found to be better than ordinary bolts with them. Supplemented afterwards by Captain English's spherical nuts and coiled washers, the &#145;plus thread&#146;, as it was called, satisfactorily solved the very difficult problem of armour bolts.<br>
<br>Palliser's third main invention was granted a patent on 27 May 1863, and was for what were called &#145;chill-cast projectiles&#146;; these subsequently became known as &#145;Palliser projectiles&#146;, despite the claim of James Nasmyth to have invented them first, some months earlier. When tested in November 1863 these projectiles were found to be a marked improvement on ordinary cast iron, but it was not until 1866 that chill-cast shot was actually recognized as superior to steel for attack on wrought-iron armour, and introduced into service at a cost of one-fifth that of steel projectiles. However, owing to the introduction of steel-faced armour, steel shot subsequently superseded them. Between 1867 and 1871 Palliser was awarded &pound;15,000 for his chilled projectiles.<br>
<br>Palliser's inventions were further developed in subsequent patents, of which he took out fourteen dealing with guns, bolts, and projectiles, between 1867 and 1881. He also patented improvements in fastenings for railway lines, in powder magazines, and in boots and shoes, between 1869 and 1873. In 1868 he married Anne, daughter of George Perham. During the siege of Paris he wrote several letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and some leading articles in it, which were afterwards embodied in a pamphlet of 1871 entitled <span class="italic">The Use of Earthen Fortresses for the Defence of London, and as a Preventive Against Invasion</span>. In these, he proposed to surround London with a chain of unrevetted earthworks, about 5 miles apart, extending from Chatham to Reading, and to occupy the most important strategical points between this chain and the coast by similar works, or clusters of works.<br>
<br>In acknowledgement of his services, Palliser was made CB (civil) in 1868, and was knighted on 16 January 1873. In March 1875 he received the cross of a commander of the Crown of Italy. After unsuccessfully contesting Devonport and Dungarvan, he was elected in 1880 for Taunton, as a Conservative, heading the poll.<br>
<br>Palliser died suddenly from &#145;angina pectoris&#146; (heart disease) at 21 Earl's Court Square, London, on 4 February 1882, and was buried in Brompton cemetery five days later. Before his death he complained that he was &#145;persecuted to the bitter end&#146; by officials in the War Office, a complaint that was repeated by others, who said that the treatment he received hastened his death. The basis of the complaint was that the War Office had deliberately blocked Palliser's application for an extension on his patent for chill-cast shot. A valuable account of the controversy that resulted can be found in the report of the royal commission on warlike stores, published in 1887.<br>

<a name="cosubject_21169"></a><span class="headword">Wray Richard Gledstanes Palliser</span>  (1821/2&#150;1891), one of Sir William's elder brothers, became sub-lieutenant RN on 13 May 1845, and lieutenant on 28 February 1847. He distinguished himself in 1854 in expeditions against Chinese pirates, being in command of the boats of the frigate <i>Spartan</i>, of which he was first lieutenant. He stormed three forts, mounting seventeen guns, and he boarded the chief vessel of a pirate fleet and rescued a French woman who was a prisoner in it. In the act of boarding he himself fell between his own boat and the other, and broke several ribs. For his gallantry in these actions, which were colourfully related in his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he was made commander on 6 January 1855. In 1857 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Fitzgerald of Muckridge House, co. Cork. He was placed on the retired list as a captain on 21 April 1870, and died of bronchitis at the Queen's Hotel, Chester, on 6 June 1891.<br>
