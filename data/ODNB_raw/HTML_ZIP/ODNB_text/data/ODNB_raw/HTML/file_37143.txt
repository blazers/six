<span class="headword">Bald,  William</span>  (1789/90&#150;1857), <span class="occ">surveyor and civil engineer</span>, was born in Burntisland, Fife, and educated at Burntisland and in Edinburgh before becoming apprenticed to the eminent Scottish land surveyor, John Ainslie. From 1803 onwards he was employed on very extensive estate surveys throughout Scotland, and his maps were used by Aaron Arrowsmith for his own map of Scotland. While still in his teens, and with an audacity that marked his whole career, he made himself known to the officers conducting the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, who recommended him to an MP for co. Mayo, Ireland, as capable of providing the Mayo grand jury with an accurate county map. (Grand juries were the principal road-making authorities and were empowered to commission such county surveys.) Bald started work in 1809 and soon secured other appointments in Mayo, first as one of the engineers employed by the government to survey and map the bogs of Ireland, and later as a road engineer. His survey of the county, completed in 1817 and published in 1830, was the most ambitious of all the Irish grand jury maps, paying special attention to trigonometrical accuracy and to the correct representation of relief and altitude. Bald planned to follow it with other county surveys of similar quality, but this ambition was frustrated when the Ordnance Survey was directed to produce its own map of Ireland in 1824, and henceforth he devoted his energies to civil engineering, a profession for which he further equipped himself by a period of renewed study and visits to places of scientific interest abroad.<br>
<br>After 1832 Bald's career becomes a catalogue of the roads, harbours, river navigations, canals, and railways designed by himself or with his advice. His first and most spectacular project in this period was the new Antrim coast road of 1832&#150;7, which involved much blasting and tunnelling in the cliffs between Larne and Ballycastle. Another road design of the same period, which included Ireland's first suspension bridge, was from Kenmare to Bantry, in the south-west. In less difficult country, such as the Irish midlands, he was an advocate of railways, and later reproached the government's commission on this subject with the inadequacy of the network it proposed for Ireland. His interest in tidal rivers began with work on the River Boyne and culminated in 1839 with re-employment in his native country as engineer to the Clyde River Trust, a post from which he was dismissed six years later after criticizing the trustees in a Glasgow newspaper. This experience does not seem to have damaged his career, and his last recorded assignment was in the same area, reporting in 1854 on the navigational implications of the <span class="roman">Glasgow Waterworks Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Bald was a prolific and articulate writer and speaker on scientific topics, the way in which science might promote economic development, and the training of civil engineers. Although he was never honoured by the government, he was elected to several learned societies, including the Royal Geological Society, the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie de Paris, to the last of which he had exhibited his Mayo map while living in Paris in the late 1820s. He was thrice married (his third wife's name was Margaret) and had nine children, one of whom, Charles (<i>b</i>. 1812/13), worked as a surveyor on his father's projects, as did William Bald, junior, probably also a son. He died on 26 March 1857 at 14 Werrington Street, Oakley Square, St Pancras, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
