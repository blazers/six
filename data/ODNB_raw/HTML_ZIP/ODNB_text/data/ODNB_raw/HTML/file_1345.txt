<span class="headword">Barclay,  John</span>  (1758&#150;1826), <span class="occ">anatomist</span>, was born at Muthill, Perthshire, on 1 December 1758, the son of Lodowick Barclay, a farmer, and Margaret McIlwhannel. John Barclay (1733&#150;1798), founder of the Berean confession in Edinburgh, was his uncle. In 1776 Barclay obtained a bursary in St Andrews University with the intention of entering the church. He was licensed as a minister and then became a tutor in Mr C. Campbell's household in 1781. While a tutor he developed an interest in natural history and human anatomy. In 1789 he became the tutor of Sir James Campbell's two sons and accompanied them to Edinburgh University. In 1792 Barclay attended lectures on anatomy and, after a period of hesitation, decided to pursue his interests in anatomy and physiology by studying medicine. While a student he acted as the assistant to John Bell (1763&#150;1820), a private anatomical lecturer. With the sponsorship of Sir James, Barclay graduated MD from Edinburgh University with the thesis <span class="italic">&#145;De anima, seu principio vitali&#146;</span> in 1796; he spent the following winter studying anatomy and surgery in London with Andrew Marshall of Holborn. He returned to Edinburgh in 1797 and began giving his own course of lectures on anatomy. He remained in Sir James's household until 1811, when he married Campbell's daughter Eleanora on 25 October that year.<br>
<br>When Barclay began lecturing, the Napoleonic Wars had created a demand both for surgeons and for anatomy courses to instruct them. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh had instituted a new degree for surgeons, and in 1804 Barclay's course was recognized as fulfilling its anatomy and surgery requirements. Barclay's lecture hall was well placed to attract students, next door to the Royal Medical Society (the chief student society) and across the street from Surgeons' Hall. Until 1825 he gave two sets of lectures a day, at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. during the six-month winter session, and towards the end of his life he gave a summer course in comparative anatomy. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1806. At one point the creation of a university chair in comparative anatomy was proposed, with Barclay as its first incumbent, but this was opposed by the medical faculty.<br>
<br>Several of Barclay's publications stemmed from his desire to fill lacunae in the literature available to his students: <span class="italic">Muscular Motions of the Human Body</span> (1808) and <span class="italic">A Description of the Arteries of the Human Body</span> (1812). He also provided references to <span class="italic">A series of engravings representing the bones of the human skeleton; with the skeletons of some of the lower animals</span> (1819), engraved by Edward Mitchell from the illustrations in M. Sue's edition of Alexander Monro's <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; d'ost&eacute;ologie</span> (Paris, 1759), on condition that the book be sold at a low price to students. Other publications, from his thesis through to his last work, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Opinions, Ancient and Modern, Concerning Life and Organization</span> (1822), reflect his firm belief in the existence of an organizing principle in living organisms which explained physiological functions. He also had a keen interest in the new science of chemistry, particularly its applications to physiology. Several of his books were dedicated to his friend Thomas Thomson, an Edinburgh private lecturer who became professor of chemistry at Glasgow University, and in <span class="italic">A new anatomical nomenclature relating to the terms which are expressive of position and aspect in the animal system</span> (1803) Barclay proposed a new nomenclature for anatomy inspired by that of A. Lavoisier in chemistry.<br>
<br>Barclay became ill in 1825, and his classes were taught by Robert Knox. He died on 21 August 1826.<br>
