<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Westcott,  Foss</span>  (1863&#150;1949), <span class="occ">bishop of Calcutta</span>, was born on 23 October 1863 in Harrow on the Hill, the fifth son of seven sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36839/', "Brooke Foss Westcott (1825&#150;1901)")</script>, Church of England clergyman and future bishop of Durham, and his wife, Sarah Louisa Mary Whithard (1830&#150;1901), the elder daughter of Thomas Whithard. He had a public-school education at Cheltenham College from 1876 to 1882, before proceeding to Peterhouse, Cambridge, and thereafter reading for his ordination (1887).<br>
<br>Four of the Westcott sons joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel as missionaries in India. Foss, with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58710/', "George Herbert Westcott")</script>, his immediate senior, subsequently bishop of Lucknow, was posted to Cawnpore in 1889. There they swiftly inaugurated industrial training for young Indian Christians. As bishop of Chota Nagpur (1905&#150;19) Foss was to develop his concern with education by founding the Bishop Westcott schools for some 400 Anglo-Indian children, while fostering his substantial Christian communities for the Santali and Munda peoples.<br>
<br>In later life he claimed that if he had inherited none of his father's scholarship, he shared his repugnance for controversy. He had absorbed at source the &#145;social Christianity&#146; taught by his father and family friends such as Bishop Lightfoot, by whom he was ordained priest. This persuasive reading of Christian faith kept divisive doctrinal issues in the background. Public-school education consolidated faith for him, as for many, as an unproblematic ideal of &#145;service&#146;. To undertake imperial responsibility with manly integrity was in itself to advance Christian civilization.<br>
<br>For many of his class, the norms of arduous sportsmanship embodied the style of this engagement with public life. Westcott, who had played football and cricket for Cambridge, became familiar as a lean, bearded figure striding across the Himalayan foothills. He thought nothing, even in his seventies, of ignoring tea breaks during afternoons of tennis in Calcutta. Westcott never married.<br>
<br>Burdened by routine administration, each of his two bishoprics posed in addition a distinctive challenge to Westcott's eirenic, organicist vision. The first challenge, precipitated by the First World War, was a crisis over German Lutheran missionaries in Chota Nagpur. All fifty or so had to be interned. The situation was delicate; the Anglicans had benefited from a secession movement in the past, and expatriate opinion was intensely anti-German. Westcott raised funds and substituted staff, refusing all applications to transfer from Lutheran communion to Anglican, lest the Lutherans should some day return. His chivalry was not universally admired. He was translated to Calcutta as metropolitan in 1919. In 1920 Oxford and Cambridge conferred on him honorary degrees of doctor of divinity.<br>
<br>A second challenge transformed his responsibilities as metropolitan. In 1927 parliament freed the church in India from the general superintendence and revision of the archbishop of Canterbury, and it became a self-governing branch of the Anglican communion. This decision entailed laborious administrative implementation, but it also called for progress in the doctrinal integration of distinct denominations, the four southern dioceses of the Anglican church of India, Burma, and Ceylon, the Methodist (originally Wesleyan) church in south India, and the South India United church (Presbyterian, British, and American Congregationalist, and Swiss Evangelical). Westcott initiated this lengthy process with tact and patience. In 1935 he could announce that agreement had been reached in south India on the fact of the historic episcopate, the Nicene and apostles' creeds, and the sacraments of holy communion and holy baptism, and that he fully expected agreement on confirmation to follow.<br>
<br>However, the emergence of Gandhian nationalism and of nationalist sentiment among native clergy and congregations increasingly exposed Westcott's limitations. In correspondence with Gandhi, while solicitous about the mahatma's health and encouraging over social reform, he was bleakly uncompromising on political dissidence and indignant about Gandhi's blackmailing tactic of fasts. He got much the worst of an exchange with Gandhi's Christian associate J. C. Kumarappa. In this Westcott, who had obtained a third-class degree in natural science (1885), referred to the necessarily absolute reliability and fixity of natural law, and insisted that Gandhian civil disobedience violated a corresponding order in social life, invoking St Paul's assertion that &#145;rulers are not a terror to the good work but to the evil&#146;  (<span class="roman">Romans</span> 13: 1&#150;3) Kumarappa gratefully printed the complete exchange in Gandhi's <span class="italic">Young India</span> in June 1930.<br>
<br>Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang, who was heavily involved in the work of the parliamentary joint select committee on Sir Samuel Hoare's white paper for the 1935 <span class="roman">India Act</span>, grew impatient with Westcott from this period, for losing touch with his responsibilities and for his involvement in the Oxford Group movement. Inspired by the American Lutheran Frank Buchman, this concentrated on inner conversion and self-reformation guided by group interaction. It was particularly active during Westcott's furlough in 1933, when he was allowed extended leave to attend its major meetings. His enthusiasm, justified in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (21 September 1933), had less to do with the movement's reactionary political tendencies, however, than with its revitalization of his faith and the supportive collectivism of its adherents. In his later years, he attempted to stimulate public interest in the problems that would face the racially mixed Anglo-Indian community in an independent India. His personal austerities did not prevent him during the war from extending generous hospitality to servicemen passing through Calcutta.<br>
<br>Westcott continued to cycle around Ranchi, India, after retiring there in 1945. He died in Darjeeling on 19 October 1949, and he was buried there.<br>
