<span class="headword">Lander,  John</span>  (1806&#150;1839), <span class="occ">traveller in Africa</span>, was born in Truro, Cornwall, the fourth son of John Lander, innkeeper, and his wife, Mary Penrose. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15975/', "Richard Lemon Lander")</script>. He was apprenticed to a printer and later became compositor to the <span class="italic">Cornwall Gazette</span>, a job which he evidently enjoyed. He was also a keen student of languages and poetry, and had published several essays and poems. He helped his brother Richard prepare the journal of his first voyage for publication. He volunteered to accompany Richard without any recompense in his expedition which left England in January 1830 to explore the course and outlet of the River Niger. The journey (described in Richard Lander's memoir) established that the river flowed into the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic coast, disproving theories, held notably by John Barrow, that it flowed into Lake Chad. John's journal was incorporated with that of Richard in the narrative of the expedition published in 1832.<br>
<br>John Lander returned to Truro and married Mary Livett, sister of his brother James's wife. His share of the money paid by John Murray to publish his journal dwindled and he secured through the patronage of Lord Goderich, president of the Royal Geographical Society, a place in the customs house, first in Liverpool and, after 1835, in London, where the three of his four children who survived infancy were born. Allibone's report, that Lander &#145;sank under the unwholesome effects of the climate and &hellip; found a grave in a land of strangers&#146; was one of several which suggest a more exotic place of death than his home, 23 Wyndham Street, Bryanston Square, London, where he died on 16 November 1839, allegedly of an illness first contracted in Africa but in fact of inflammation of the lungs. His widow was given a civil pension of &pound;75 a year.<br>
<br>The discovery made by Lander and his brother was a significant step in geographical discovery in Africa and also opened up the Niger, seen as the highway into central Africa, to trade, settlement, and ultimately to Nigeria's becoming a British protectorate.<br>
