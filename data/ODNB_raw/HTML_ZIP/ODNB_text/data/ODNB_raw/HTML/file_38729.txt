<span class="headword">Kipling,  John Lockwood</span>  (1837&#150;1911), <span class="occ">artist and art school administrator</span>, was born at Kirbymoorside, Pickering, Yorkshire, on 6 July 1837, the eldest child of the Revd Joseph Kipling (1805&#150;1862), a Methodist minister, and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lockwood, the daughter of a Cleveland builder and architect. He was educated at Woodhouse Grove near Bradford (the Wesleyan academy for the sons of the ministry) between 1845 and 1852. A visit to the Great Exhibition in 1851, aged thirteen, inspired him to become an artist and craftsman. He served as an apprentice, designer, and modeller at Pinder, Bourne &amp; Co. a Wesleyan ceramics business at Burslem, Staffordshire, while taking evening classes at the Potteries School of Art, Stoke-on-Trent (1853&#150;6) and then at Stoke and Fenton School of Art (1856&#150;9). His teachers included Albert Carrier-Belleuse and Hugues Prot&acirc;t).<br>
<br>In 1859 Kipling joined the architectural sculptor John Birnie Philip in London for two years, and assisted on the decoration of St Michael's, Cornhill, City of London, on the chapel of Exeter College, Oxford, and on All Souls, Hayley Hill, Halifax. He also worked for the sculptor John Thomas. He moved to the department of science and art at the South Kensington Museum in 1861 to assist Godfrey Sykes in modelling much of the exterior terracotta decoration of the new museum buildings (today the Victoria and Albert Museum), in liaison with the manufacturers in Burslem. Kipling's rise to prominence is commemorated by a mosaic panel, designed by Sykes (1868&#150;9), showing a procession in which he follows immediately after the museum's director, its architect, and Sykes.<br>
<br>Kipling added his mother's maiden name to his own in 1863. He married on 18 March 1865 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58273/', "Alice Macdonald")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76071/', "Macdonald sisters")</script>], the eldest of four surviving daughters of John Browne Macdonald, a Wesleyan Methodist minister; wedding guests included Edward Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown, and Algernon Swinburne. In January 1865 Kipling had signed a three-year contract to teach ceramics and architectural sculpture at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy School of Art in Bombay, and in April 1865 he sailed to India with Alice. Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34334/', "(Joseph) Rudyard Kipling")</script> was born in Bombay in December 1865. On his son's birth certificate he gave his occupation as &#145;architectural sculptor&#146;; on his wedding certificate he had stated &#145;artist&#146;.<br>
<br>Kipling arrived in Bombay at the end of a period of prosperity caused by the export of cotton to Britain during the American Civil War. He contributed to the architectural decoration of many new public buildings, both directly and through his pupils and assistants, such as the reliefs and fountain in Crawford Market. When his contract at the art school expired in 1868 it was renewed through the support of the dowager Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, but without the added income from private pupils. Kipling and his wife supplemented their income as journalists, writing for the <span class="italic">Pioneer</span>, the <span class="italic">Bombay Builder</span>, the <span class="italic">Bombay Gazette</span>, and the <span class="italic">Civil and Military Gazette</span>. Their daughter, Alice, was born in June 1868. A second son, John, was born in 1870 but did not survive.<br>
<br>Kipling secured commissions from the government of India to travel and make documentary drawings, suitable for exhibition and publication, of local craft industries. In 1870 he recorded craftsmen at work in the North-Western Provinces; in 1872 he documented cotton cultivation in Khamgaon and village crafts in the Deccan. His pen and ink studies (now Victoria and Albert Museum, British Library, and Sussex University) were first shown, with sample wares, at international exhibitions in London (1871, 1872), Vienna (1873), and Paris (1878); in 1880 they went on display in the new India section of the South Kensington Museum. Some were published in eleven articles in the <span class="italic">Journal of Indian Art</span> (1884&#150;8), the two pilot &#145;specimen numbers&#146; of which (1883) Kipling prepared. Through his published drawings and accompanying articles Kipling became a champion of traditional Indian architecture, arts and crafts, and teaching methods at risk from British exports to India; soon he rivalled George Birdwood as a leader of the movement to preserve Indian arts, architecture, and design.<br>
<br>From 1875 until his retirement in 1893 Kipling served as principal of the Mayo School of Art (today the National College of Arts, Pakistan) and curator of the Lahore Central Museum. He was immortalized in this role as the &#145;Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House&#146; by Rudyard Kipling in <span class="italic">Kim</span> (1901). As a reformer he developed a pioneering approach to art education, based on traditional crafts and methods of training. He designed banners and other decoration for Lord Lytton's imperial assemblage, the &#145;Delhi Durbar&#146; (1877), where Victoria was proclaimed empress of India. As part of his art school duties he also became an exhibition curator, promoting Indian (especially Punjabi) art and crafts at international exhibitions (Vienna 1873, Paris 1878, Melbourne 1880, Amsterdam 1883, Calcutta 1883, London 1886, Glasgow 1888) while also undertaking private commissions, particularly for the local specialism of decorative woodcarving. A billiard room for the duke of Connaught at Bagshot Park, Surrey (1884&#150;90), led directly to a commission from Queen Victoria for the Durbar Room at Osborne (1890&#150;92). As well as his journalism he published a travelogue with T. H. Thornton, <span class="italic">Lahore</span> (1876), published anonymously; <span class="italic">Descriptive List of Photographic Negatives of Buddhist Sculptures in the Lahore Central Museum</span> (1889); and <span class="italic">Beast and Man in India</span> (1891). He provided illustrations for Edward Emmerson Oliver, <span class="italic">Across the Border</span> (1890), and Flora Annie Webster Steel and Richard Carnac Temple, <span class="italic">Tales of the Punjab Told by the People</span> (1894).<br>
<br>Kipling retired from Lahore in 1893 and settled in Tisbury, Wiltshire, where he illustrated several of his son's (and other) publications. He was made a fellow of the University of Bombay (1875) and CIE in 1887. He died from a heart attack at Clouds, the Wiltshire country house of his friend Percy Wyndham, on 26 January 1911, and was buried in the parish church at Tisbury alongside his wife, who had died a few weeks earlier. He was pleasant company (&#145;shrewd, original, kindly, humorous&#146;&#151;<span class="italic">Pioneer Mail</span>, 1893), and was especially close to his son, taking great pride in his literary success.<br>
