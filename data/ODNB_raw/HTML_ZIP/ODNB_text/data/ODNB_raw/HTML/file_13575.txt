<span class="headword">Holloway, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627, <em>d.</em> 1699), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized on 21 October 1627 at St Aldates, Oxford, the second son of John Holloway BCL (<i>d</i>. 1675) of Oxford and Susan Anyan (<i>d</i>. 1685) of Sandwich, Kent, sister of Dr Thomas Anyan. Holloway's father was an official to the archdeacon of Berkshire and a &#145;covetous civilian and public notary&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Holloway matriculated at New College, Oxford, in March 1643; he was expelled by the parliamentary visitors in 1648 and is not known to have taken a degree. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1646 and called to the bar on 24 November 1658. His name does not appear in any law reports, and he probably practised locally in Oxford, where he lived opposite the Blue Boar in St Aldates parish. On 10 November 1659 he married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1672), daughter of John Smith MP, of Kennington, Berkshire.<br>
<br>In February 1666 Holloway was elected recorder of Wallingford. Having been called to the bench of his inn in 1670 he was made a serjeant-at-law in October 1677. He was one of the counsel for the prosecution of Stephen College at Oxford in 1681 on a charge of high treason. On 18 April 1683 he was made a king's serjeant, and was knighted on 24 May. On 25 September 1683 he was made a judge of king's bench, and in November was one of the judges before whom Algernon Sidney was tried. In January 1684 the earl of Danby described Holloway as being particularly under the influence of Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys. Holloway's judicial patent was confirmed on the accession of James II. He also concurred in the sentence on Titus Oates and on the earl of Devonshire for assaulting Colonel Thomas Colepeper in the royal presence. Holloway was in favour of the dispensing power, and appears to have given the king advice on the way to proceed over the Magdalen College affair. However, he resisted James II's attempts to have martial law imposed on the army in time of peace without the consent of parliament. Further, during the trial of the seven bishops in June 1688 he defended the right of the subject to petition the monarch and believed that the bishops were not guilty of seditious libel as there was no intent to be seditious. As a consequence of his actions at this trial he received his quietus on 2 July 1688. Following the revolution he was summoned before the House of Lords to explain his judgments in the Oates and Devonshire cases, and before the Commons to explain why he was turned out of office. He was excepted from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> in 1690 because of his support for the dispensing power. Holloway lived in retirement in Oxford until his death in 1699, his will being proved in 1700.<br>
