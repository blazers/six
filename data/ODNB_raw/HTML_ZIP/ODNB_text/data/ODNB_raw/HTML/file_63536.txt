<span class="headword">Price,  Joseph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1727&#150;1796), <span class="occ">merchant and pamphleteer</span>, described himself as &#145;Having been born in Wales, suckled with Welch blood&#146; and having &#145;the Welch devil&#146; in him  (Price, 38). It seems that his family came from Monmouth, but other indications of his parentage or upbringing are lacking. He evidently went to India for the first time in 1750, to make his living by the sea as what was known as a &#145;free merchant&#146;, that is, a person not in the service of the East India Company who was permitted to sail ships in Asian waters and trade on his own behalf in the &#145;country trade&#146; between Asian ports. His first base seems to have been Bombay, but from 1767 he resided in Calcutta, where he became a prominent member of the European community, always known as Captain Price and attracting epithets such as &#145;honest&#146; or &#145;a man of spirit&#146;.<br>
<br>In his early years in Bengal, Price's commercial activities were very extensive. He evidently took over the business of Robert Gregory, another free merchant, who returned to Britain with a great fortune. Price wrote that he had once had twenty-four ships &#145;navigating the seas on my own credit&#146;. He made nine voyages as captain or managing agent from India to the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf  (Price, 50&#150;51, 71). The extent of his involvement in the China trade is revealed by transactions with Warren Hastings, on whose behalf he shipped cargoes insured for &pound;36,000 to Canton (Guangzhou) in 1774. By then, however, Price's affairs had begun to deteriorate to the point where he could not pay his creditors either in India or in Britain.<br>
<br>In 1778 Hastings gave Price command of two armed merchant ships to support the navy in operations against the French. In 1780 Price left India to try to settle with his British creditors and to gain an office from the East India Company for his return. While in Britain he found a new vocation as a pamphleteer. Fourteen tracts have been attributed to him, nearly all published in 1782 or 1783. They were for the most part highly polemical, extolling his friends, above all Hastings, and mercilessly lampooning his enemies, as when he dismissed the pious Charles Grant as &#145;the most canting, Presbyterian, methodistical, sniveling Oliverian, Scotland ever produced&#146;  (Price, 114). Polemic aside, his tracts contain some vivid vignettes of British society in Bengal and his <span class="italic">Letters from a Free Merchant</span> provides valuable information about the working of the country trade. Price was not sure that Hastings fully appreciated his zeal on his behalf, writing &#145;You will lift up your Eyes, and express your wish that this Old Fool would be quiet and mind his Own Affairs&#146;  (Grier, 351). For a time Price's creditors confined him for debt, but he was able to return to India in 1784 with the promise that he would succeed to the office of marine storekeeper in Bengal. In 1786 he duly assumed that office and also became marine paymaster. Although creditors such as Hastings were never to be paid off, Price's affairs seem to have prospered a little, until he was suspended from office in 1792 and found insane. In 1793 his nephew, also called Joseph Price, was given permission to have him sent to Britain. Price's last years in London were such that his death there &#145;without a Pang or Struggle&#146; on 3 June 1796 was regarded by his friends as &#145;a consummation devoutly to be wished&#146;  (E. Baber to W. Hastings, 4 June 1796, BL, Add. MS 29174, fol. 317). There is no record of Price's either marrying or having any children. His nephew was his sole heir.<br>
