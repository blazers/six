<span class="headword">Hiller,  Erwin</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Erwin Hillier]</span>  (1911&#150;2005), <span class="occ">cinematographer</span>, was born on 2 September 1911 in Berlin, of mixed Anglo-German parentage; his father was Robert Hiller, described by Erwin as &#145;of independent means&#146;. He grew up in Germany and as a result his English retained a continental inflection for the rest of his life. After attending art school, he made his first contacts with the German film industry, working on a number of productions, including Fritz Lang's first sound film, the classic <span class="italic">M</span> (1931), where he assisted the principal cameraman, Fritz Arno Wagner. Although he often referred to having known and worked with various luminaries of Weimar cinema, the full extent of his cinematic apprenticeship in the German film industry is difficult to assess, as nearly all his contributions were uncredited. Nevertheless, his training in Germany had a marked effect on the style of his later work in Britain, especially in its emphasis on atmospheric lighting, visual fluidity, and unusual angles and movements.<br>
<br>Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Hiller relocated to London, briefly working as a press photographer, and joining Gaumont British's camera department. On 27 May 1933, at Kensington register office, he married Helen Yates, the twenty-year-old daughter of Joseph Southgate; they had one daughter, Shirley. Meanwhile, at Gaumont British's Shepherd's Bush studios Hiller became a camera operator on productions including Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">Waltzes from Vienna</span> and <span class="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</span> (both 1934), assisting the established cinematographers Glen MacWilliams and Curt Courant respectively. He also worked on the Jessie Matthews musical <span class="italic">Evergreen</span> (1934), directed by Victor Saville and once again with MacWilliams as principal photographer, and on two Walter Forde films, <span class="italic">Jack Ahoy!</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Brown on Resolution</span> (1935), in both cases working under Bernard Knowles. For most of these films Hiller received no screen credits. In the mid-1930s he moved on from Gaumont to work on such cheaply made &#145;quota quickies&#146; as the Warner Brothers comedy <span class="italic">The Girl in the Crowd</span> (1935), shot at Teddington Studios, which marked his first film with the director Michael Powell. The two were reunited working for Joe Rock Studios at Elstree on the mystery drama <span class="italic">The Man Behind the Mask</span> (1936), and on Powell's first collaboration with the Hungarian screenwriter Emeric Pressburger, the spy thriller <span class="italic">The Spy in Black</span> (1939).<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Hiller (by now known professionally as Erwin Hillier) became principal photographer on a number of propaganda shorts commissioned by the Ministry of Information; these included <span class="italic">Men of Tomorrow</span> (1942), produced by Sydney Box, which showcased the contributions from boy scouts to the war effort. The same year Hiller shot his first feature film as principal cinematographer, the comedy <span class="italic">The Lady from Lisbon</span> (1942), a British National production, followed by <span class="italic">Rhythm Serenade</span> (1943), a patriotic musical starring Vera Lynn. <span class="italic">The Silver Fleet</span> (1943), a drama about Dutch wartime resistance, marked the beginning of his association with Powell and Pressburger's production company The Archers. The richly allegorical <span class="italic">A Canterbury Tale</span> (1944) combined Hiller's predilection for chiaroscuro compositions with a perceptive way of photographing the English countryside.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">I Know Where I'm Going!</span> (1945), for which he was credited by now unusually as Erwin Hiller, not Hillier, he devised a sublimely lyrical visual backdrop for the film's romantic drama set in Scotland's Western Isles. By now acclaimed primarily as an expert in black and white photography, he was replaced by Jack Cardiff in The Archers' subsequent colour films, <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Black Narcissus</span> (1947), while his own d&eacute;but on a colour production, the musical <span class="italic">London Town</span> (1946), proved a flop. Roy Ward Baker's atmospheric black and white <i>film noir</i> <span class="italic">The October Man</span> (1947), starring John Mills as an amnesiac accused of murder, played much more to Hiller's strengths, as did Brian Desmond Hurst's Gothic melodrama <span class="italic">The Mark of Cain</span> (1947), and Lawrence Huntington's <span class="italic">Mr Perrin and Mr Traill</span> (1948), set in a gloomy boarding school.<br>
<br>The whimsical war comedy <span class="italic">Private Angelo</span> (1949), starring Peter Ustinov as a cowardly Italian soldier, marked the beginning of Hiller's long association with the director Michael Anderson. In the 1950s their collaborations encompassed comedies (<span class="italic">Will Any Gentleman &hellip;?</span>, 1953), thrillers (<span class="italic">The House of the Arrow</span>, 1953; <span class="italic">Chase a Crooked Shadow</span>, 1958), and the acclaimed <span class="italic">Shake Hands with the Devil</span> (1959), set in Dublin in 1921, but their biggest success was the iconic war drama <span class="italic">The Dam Busters</span> (1955), about the legendary &#145;bouncing bomb&#146; attacks on the Ruhr dams. The film was a success not least thanks to Hiller's breathtaking and authentic aerial photography, once again showcasing his mastery of black and white photography.<br>
<br>During the 1960s Anderson and Hiller collaborated on a series of increasingly international productions, including the thrillers <span class="italic">The Naked Edge</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Operation Crossbow</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">The Quiller Memorandum</span> (1966), the latter scripted by Harold Pinter. Their last collaboration was the papal drama <span class="italic">The Shoes of the Fisherman</span> (1968). Hiller worked occasionally with other directors, and was nominated for a BAFTA award for <span class="italic">Sammy Going South</span> (1963), directed by Alexander Mackendrick. His last film was <span class="italic">The Valley of Gwangwi</span> (1969), directed by Jim O'Connolly, which mixed cowboys with dinosaurs. He died of ischaemic heart disease at his home, 7 Baronsmede, Ealing, London, on 10 January 2005, and was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
