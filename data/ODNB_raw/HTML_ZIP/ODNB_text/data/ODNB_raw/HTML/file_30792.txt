<span class="headword">Barnes,  John Morrison</span>  (1913&#150;1975), <span class="occ">toxicologist</span>, was born in Sheffield at midnight on 11&#150;12 January 1913, the elder son and elder child of Alfred Edward Barnes, later professor of medicine in the University of Sheffield, and his wife, Janet (Jessie) Morrison. Barnes's younger brother, (Harry) Jefferson Barnes (<i>d</i>. 1979) was knighted on retirement from the Glasgow School of Art. John Barnes, after education at Repton School, went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1930; he was awarded a scholarship in 1932, and took first classes in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1932 and 1933), specializing in pathology in part two. In 1933 he entered Sheffield medical school, gaining conjoint and Cambridge qualifications in 1936&#151;MB, BChir, MRCS, LRCP.<br>
<br>After a residency in Sheffield, Barnes took a house surgeonship at the Wingfield&#150;Morris Orthopaedic Hospital in Oxford, which led to a Nuffield research fellowship in orthopaedics (1938&#150;42). This was an important step, for it led to training under H. W. Florey in the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, in research on the lymphocyte, and then to work with Josep A. Trueta on wound drainage and arterial spasm, and to Barnes's becoming honorary director of the Medical Research Council (MRC) burns unit at Oxford. His war service in the Royal Army Medical Corps was as a specialist pathologist in the biology section of the chemical warfare experimental station at Porton Camp, conducting research under the direction of Paul Fildes and D. W. W. Henderson. By 1947 he had been trained in experimental pathology, and had worked on shock, and on the toxicity of venoms, bacterial toxins, and the tannic acid used in the treatment of burns.<br>
<br>The MRC, during the secretaryship of Sir Edward Mellanby, decided in 1947 to establish a toxicology unit to undertake research in the general field of toxicology as it applied to chemical hazards in industry and agriculture. This was in response to the increasing number of enquiries from industry about the safety or otherwise of new chemical substances. Barnes was appointed the first director. The unit was initially housed at Porton, but with the need for expansion moved in 1950 to Carshalton. At the time of his appointment, toxicology hardly existed as a discipline, but was seen as a series of routine investigations into <i>ad hoc</i> problems, which was of little scientific interest. It was Barnes's life work to reveal its scientific potential, and to establish the value of analysing the general mechanisms by which bodily injury may be brought about as the best basis for rational decisions about control procedures. The study began with work on liver damage caused by beryllium, and on an insecticide and a weedkiller which were both widely used. It was followed by studies on DDT, tin compounds, dinitrophenol, the nitrosamines, the Senecio alkaloids, the groundnut fungal product aflatoxin, lead, dieldrin, mercury, and neuropathies and other damage due to industrial solvents. To such work was added fundamental research, usually of a biochemical type, on general mechanisms.<br>
<br>At the same time there was continuing service on MRC committees&#151;those on toxicology (of which he was secretary for thirteen years), food adulterants, fungicides and insecticides, detergents, lung cancer, non-explosive anaesthetics, cancer of the tropics, and occupational health. The topics reflected the growing attention paid to toxicology both medically and politically, which owed much to Barnes's leadership in showing how to tackle extremely varied problems with scientific rigour. In turn this led to much other advisory work, especially for the World Health Organization, for which the toxicology unit became a reference centre.<br>
<br>In 1941 Barnes married Ruth Eleanor, daughter of the Revd Edward Joseph Northcote-Green, of Oxford. There were three children: the eldest, Andrew Nicholas, trained in chemistry; the second, Stephen Edward, became a consultant paediatrician in Salisbury; and the youngest, Rachel Elizabeth, married R. E. McGavin. Barnes was appointed CBE in 1962. He died on 24 September 1975 in the Atkinson Morley Hospital, Wimbledon.<br>
<br>Barnes combined great steadiness of character and a dry humour with extreme modesty and a detestation of pretentiousness of any kind. He concealed his own achievements and resisted being proposed for the Royal Society. A very hard worker, he listed his recreations as &#145;none&#146;. He could seem rather austere and formidable, and yet those who came to know him, or better still to work with him, found him sensitive and supportive. He had a very good eye for new talent, enjoyed bringing on younger investigators, and never took his share of appreciation for their achievements. After his death British toxicology had advanced enough to justify the formation of a British Toxicology Society, which was largely due to the initiative of his colleagues and pupils. One of their early actions, after a well-supported appeal, was to establish the John Barnes lecture in his memory.<br>
