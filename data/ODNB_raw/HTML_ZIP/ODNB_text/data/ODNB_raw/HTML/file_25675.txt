<span class="headword">Skeyne <span class="st"> [Skene]</span>,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1522&#150;1599), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Bandodle, Aberdeenshire, was the fifth son of James Skeyne or Skene (<i>d</i>. 1547), and his wife, Janet Lumsden. The father practised as a notary public at the farm of Bandodle on the Skene estate, near Aberdeen. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25669/', "Sir John Skene of Curriehill (c.1540&#150;1617)")</script>, jurist, was his younger brother Gilbert was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and at King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA. He then studied medicine, graduated MD, and was appointed mediciner or professor of medicine in King's College in 1556. In 1568 he became one of the ordinary regents of the college. Skeyne married Agnes Lawson, widow of John Uddart, in 1569. It was not a happy marriage. Skeyne was collated to the burse of medicine in King's College in 1571. He moved to Edinburgh in 1575 and bought a house in Niddrie Wynd, where he developed a successful practice. On 16 June 1581 he was appointed doctor of medicine to James VI, with a salary of &pound;200.<br>
<br>Skeyne wrote <span class="italic">Ane breve descriptioun of the pest quhair in the causis, signis, and sum speciall preseruatioun and cure thairof ar contenit</span> (1568). While not dismissing the power of prayer and the need for the repentance of sins, Skeyne considered that the disease arose from &#145;stench and corruption and filth&#146;  (Hamilton, 14). This was the earliest medical work to appear in the vernacular in Scotland. It was reprinted, under the editorship of William Forbes Skene, for the Bannatyne Club (1860). The reprint includes <span class="italic">Ane breif descriptioun of the qualiteis and effectis of the well of the Woman Hill besyde Abirdene</span> (1580), published anonymously, but now thought to be the work of Skeyne. In it he discusses the healing powers of the well's waters.<br>
<br>Skeyne retired from practice in 1593, and died in 1599, leaving neither children nor a will. His widow engaged in a long legal battle with his family over the estate, which was eventually divided among several nephews and nieces.<br>
