<span class="headword">Marlborough,  Thomas  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1236), <span class="occ">historian, lawyer, and abbot of Evesham</span>, presumably came from Marlborough in Wiltshire. He studied at Paris under Stephen Langton (<i>d</i>. 1228), most likely arts, when Richard Poor or Poore (<i>d</i>. 1235) was his fellow student: this was probably in the 1180s. He describes John of Tynemouth, Simon of Sywell, and Master Honorius as his &#145;masters in the schools&#146;, and as the common bond between these three is that they were all canonists active at Oxford, he must have also studied there, presumably canon law. It is clear from the chronicle he wrote that he was well versed in law, and had taught at Oxford, before he was professed at Evesham. His teaching must have been in the growing university because there were no grammar schools of importance at Oxford, such as those attached to cathedrals, but the statement that he taught also at Exeter is likely to be the result of a miscopying or mishearing of the text. He was thus no ordinary young novice when he arrived at Evesham to be professed in 1199/1200. By this date, given his previous training and career, he must have been at least in his thirties. Circumstances then arose that were to thrust him into prominence.<br>
<br>In 1202 the newly appointed Bishop Mauger of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1212) attempted to visit Evesham. From this point until the settlement of the case, Marlborough's activities were taken up with the convent's determined struggle to prove its exemption from the bishop. For its defiance in refusing entry to the bishop, the convent was excommunicated. The monks sought to bring the abbey's case before the archbishop of Canterbury. But the case was too complex for settlement by any other court than the final one and appeal was made to the pope. The main case over the exemption from the diocesan, and the complementary case of the monastery's jurisdiction over the local area known as the Vale, were both fought out at Rome before the masterly Pope Innocent III and his advisers. Marlborough went to Rome to present the abbey's case and during this time he attended the schools at Bologna. In the struggle against the bishop, the abbot and convent attempted to present a united front, although the infamous Abbot Roger Norreis had never been accepted by the monks. He had mercilessly tyrannized over them, keeping them short of food and clothing, calling them &#145;dogs&#146;, acting more like a layman than a priest, and wasting the convent's lands. He was a drunkard and a lecher, and reputed to be a murderer. He was adept at making friends in influential places, which allowed him to be promoted and to survive for so long without censure. It was agreed that any charges against the abbot would not be raised at Rome, though the abbot's treatment of the convent's proctors at Rome was infamous.<br>
<br>After the triumph in 1205, when the abbey's exemption was declared, and the judgment on jurisdiction over the Vale (1207), the main struggle at Evesham was to control Abbot Roger Norreis and to restore the monastery. In both these matters Marlborough was closely involved, and from 1206 he acted as dean of the Vale. Matters were made more difficult by the interdict on the English church from 1208 to 1214, and, indeed, by the abbey's newly won exemption from any kind of correction by the diocesan. The convent was not finally relieved of the abbot until his deposition in 1213. As dean of the Vale, Marlborough attended the Fourth Lateran Council in Rome with Abbot Randulf, and while they were there the pope approved on 16 February 1216 the constitutions that had been drawn up to specify the properties of the obedientiaries and their rights and privileges&#151;an attempt to restore the position of the convent after Abbot Norreis's depredations of their lands and revenues. In this remarkable document Marlborough doubtless had a hand. In 1217 he was made sacrist, and a year later he was appointed prior.<br>
<br>During his time as prior Marlborough completed what has misleadingly been called his chronicle of the abbey. It is in fact a unique account of the lawsuit fought out at Rome, which he prefaced with an abbreviated edition of Prior Dominic's life of St Ecgwine and <span class="italic">Gesta</span> of the abbots, written in the early twelfth century, and of the continued <span class="italic">Gesta</span> up to the time of Abbot Norreis (1191). The whole of the description of the lawsuit is written with a frankness and verve that makes the work remarkable on those counts alone. His vivid description of the journey to Rome, of the way in which the curia operated, of the pope and the cardinals, of the trials and tribulations of the petitioner, are without parallel at this date. He was observant and perceptive, and could tell a good story. There are small and important details: the advice of the pope to go to study at Bologna (which he did for six months), Marlborough's fainting for joy when the exemption was declared, and many other memorable vignettes. The great speech made by Marlborough nearly ten years later before the legate, Nicol&ograve;, bishop of Tusculum (mistakenly identified as Pandulf by earlier historians), prefacing the final fall of Roger Norreis, is memorable.<br>
<br>Marlborough's subsequent career was taken up with paying off the debts consequent upon the lawsuit and maintaining every aspect of the abbey's rights (perhaps condoning further forgeries). He did, however, submit the convent to archiepiscopal visitation. The continuation of the &#145;chronicle&#146; includes lives and acts of the abbots and reveals that it was due to him that the customs and revenues were finally written down and approved at the time of the Lateran Council. The biographer is fond of detailing building works: according to him, Marlborough, as sacrist, repaired much of the damage that had been caused to the windows and tombs in the presbytery by the collapse of the tower. He renewed the shrine of St Wigstan, had a reading-desk made for the choir, put a stove in the church at the base of the clock, and had twelve albs made. All this he did in the year before he was appointed prior and much of it was paid for by his careful financial management as sacrist. As prior he brought with him a considerable number of books, including law books, unfortunately not specified. There were also works on natural science, classical authors, sermons, commentaries, and books on grammar and music. He had several books produced (including what is now Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A. 287, to fol. 181<i>v</i>) and he purchased others. He continued to beautify the church, particularly concentrating on the story of St Ecgwine (Evesham's premier saint) in the stained glass of the presbytery and on his shrine, for which he built a throne.<br>
<br>On the death of Abbot Randulf, Marlborough was elected abbot on 20 December 1229, confirmed by the pope in 1230, and blessed by the bishop of Coventry, and finally, after the king had had granted possession of the abbey, installed by the bishop at Michaelmas. The period during which the king had had possession was costly, as was the election process, so Marlborough began his abbatiate in debt. However, judicious management enabled him to enhance the dignity and appearance of the church, to construct comfortable quarters for the abbot, and to build his own tomb. He died at Evesham on 12 September 1236 and was buried there.<br>
