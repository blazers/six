<span class="headword">Dodson,  Michael</span>  (1732&#150;1799), <span class="occ">barrister and biblical scholar</span>, the only son of Joseph Dodson, dissenting minister at Marlborough, Wiltshire, and Elizabeth Foster, was born there on 20 or 21 September 1732. He was educated at Marlborough grammar school and then, in accordance with the advice of his maternal uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9964/', "Sir Michael Foster (1689&#150;1763)")</script>, justice of the king's bench, was entered at the Middle Temple on 31 August 1754. He practised for many years as a special pleader but was finally called to the bar on 4 July 1783. In 1770 he was appointed one of the commissioners of bankruptcy, a post he held until his death. On 31 December 1778 he married Elizabeth Hawkes of Marlborough.<br>
<br>Dodson was held in high regard as a legal expert, and among his legal writings was an edition with notes and references of Sir Michael Foster's <span class="italic">Report of some proceedings on the commission for the trial of rebels in the year 1746 in the county of Surrey and of other crown cases</span>, first published in 1762, with a third edition in 1792. In 1795 he wrote a <span class="italic">Life of Sir Michael Foster</span>. This, originally intended for the new edition of the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, was published in 1811 with a preface by John Disney.<br>
<br>Dodson, who was a Unitarian in religion, was probably held in even higher regard for his critical judgement on biblical literature. His most famous publication, <span class="italic">A New Translation of Isaiah</span> (1790), which was an answer to Bishop Robert Lowth's earlier translation, brought about a long-running, but generally good-humoured, disputation with Lowth's nephew, Dr John Sturges. He wrote many other theological works, including several papers for the Society for Promoting the Knowledge of the Scriptures, and his works were much admired by his friend John Disney.<br>
<br>Dodson enjoyed good health until the last year of his life, when he began to suffer from a chest infection, probably tuberculosis. By October 1799 he was confined to bed, and he died at home in Boswell Court, Carey Street, London, on 13 November of the same year. He was buried in Bunhill Fields on 21 November.<br>
