<span class="headword">Martin,  Gregory</span>  (1542?&#150;1582), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and biblical translator</span>, was born at Maxfield in Guestling, Sussex. Little is known about his family and early life. Nominated in 1557 as one of the original scholars at St John's College, Oxford, by Sir Thomas White, the college's founder, Martin was an exact contemporary of Edmund Campion. Together they proceeded to the BA and MA degrees. They continued at St John's as fellows and lecturers: Campion in rhetoric (1564&#150;70) and Martin in Greek (1564&#150;8). In 1567 or 1568 Martin dedicated a manuscript on Greek pronunciation to Henry Fitzalan, earl of Arundel, who had visited Oxford (published in 1712 as <span class="italic">Gregorius Martinus ad Adolphum Mekerchum pro veteri &amp; vera Graecarum literarum pronunciatione</span>). The earl's son-in-law, Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, subsequently offered Martin a position in his household as tutor to his sons, one of whom was Philip Howard, the future earl of Arundel.<br>
<br>Martin resigned his St John's fellowship on 15 December 1568. Presumably religion played a role in Martin's decision: in Oxford pressure to conform to the established church was intense. There would be more freedom in the duke's household, where by word and example he encouraged the family to remain steadfast in the old faith. After the duke was arrested in 1569 as a result of the revolt of the northern earls, the household was forced to attend common prayers and services conducted by Church of England ministers. Martin fled to the continent. Before his departure, he exhorted Campion that he must not allow material worries to prevent him from following his religious convictions: &#145;if we two can live together, we can live for nothing; if this is too little, I have money; but if this fails, one thing remains: they that sow in tears shall reap in joy&#146;  (Gillow, <span class="italic">Lit. biog. hist.</span>, 4.485).<br>
<br>William Allen welcomed Martin to the recently founded English College at Douai, and Campion joined him in the summer of 1570. Together they studied theology at the new University of Douai. Both received their bachelor's degree on 21 January 1573. Martin was ordained in Brussels on 21 March 1573, and Campion departed for Rome in the spring to join the Jesuits. Martin continued his studies and was awarded a licentiate in theology on 11 January 1575. In May 1576 he started lecturing in Hebrew at the English College at Douai.<br>
<br>In February 1576 Allen and other English religious exiles had agreed to convert the English Hospice in Rome into a college for the education of clergy. The first group of students departed from Douai on 9 November under Martin's direction. Enrolled as a chaplain of the hospice, Martin both taught the seminarians and devised a programme of studies for them. He remained in Rome for nearly eighteen months, a rather turbulent time as English and Welsh students clashed at the new college. Informed of Martin's arrival in Rome, Campion recommended to Robert Persons on 25 June 1577 that they try to entice Martin into the Society of Jesus: &#145;Do let us conspire to deliver that good soul; it is good fishing&#146;  (Simpson, 119). A week later, on 3 July 1577, Campion wrote to Martin:<blockquote>since for so many years we had in common our college, our meals, our studies, our opinions, our fortune, our degrees, our tutors, our friends, and our enemies, let us for the rest of our lives make a more close and binding union, that we may have the fruit of our friendship in heaven. (Simpson, 126)</blockquote>On 28 November 1578 Persons suggested that Allen had foiled their plans: &#145;Mr. Marten was called away herhence by Mr. D. Allen his letters, I think they were half afrayd of him what myght becum of hym&#146;  (Hicks, 2). Allen may have had a more innocent reason for recalling Martin: an English translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In any case, Persons explained to William Good that the disturbances at the hospice had made Martin &#145;weary of Rome&#146;  (Hicks, 9). On 23 July 1578 Martin returned to the English College, recently transferred from Douai to Rheims. Oddly, no sources mention a reunion during Campion's sojourn at Rheims before his departure for England in June 1580. None the less, Martin commemorated his martyred friend with a Latin poetic eulogy first published in Allen's <span class="italic">A Brief Historie of the Glorious Martyrdom of xii. Reverend Priests</span> (1582).<br>
<br>In November 1578 Martin addressed a crucial problem for English Catholics in <span class="italic">A Treatise of Schisme</span>. The Elizabethan <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> (1 Eliz. I c. 2) demanded that everyone attend services of the established church. Absentees could be punished by fines or imprisonment. Because of loyalty to their queen or fear of punishment, many Catholics considered passive attendance acceptable. The Council of Trent discussed the issue and condemned the practice. Citing scriptural and historical precedents, Martin justified Trent's decision and demonstrated, as his subtitle claimed, &#145;that al Catholikes ought in any wise to abstaine altogether from heretical Conventicles&#146;. At the trial of William Carter, the work's printer, in 1584, Martin's exhortation that Catholics imitate Judith, who refused to dine with Holofernes, was interpreted as an appeal to assassinate the queen: Carter was condemned and executed.<br>
<br>As Martin completed this controversial manual, he embarked on an English translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Allen announced the project in September 1578. He, Richard Bristow, and William Reynolds were involved primarily as revisers: the work was Martin's. Between September 1578 and July 1580 Martin translated the entire <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>. <span class="italic">The New Testament of Iesus Christ</span> with Bristow's notes was published at Rheims in 1582. For financial reasons the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> did not appear until the two volumes of <span class="italic">The Holie Bible</span> were published at Douai in 1609&#150;10. The appearance of a Catholic <span class="roman">Bible</span> in English undermined traditional protestant criticism that the Roman church kept scripture out of the hands of the laity. Instead protestant theologians such as Thomas Cartwright, William Whitaker, and William Fulke attacked the credentials of the translators and denounced their work as filled with error. Despite such criticism, revised versions of Martin's translation remained extremely popular throughout the English-speaking world for nearly four hundred years.<br>
<br>Translating the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> made Martin even more aware that theological errors could be both the cause and the effect of faulty translations. On 13 February 1579 he informed Campion that he had nearly finished a manuscript on protestant corruption and abuse of scripture. <span class="italic">A Discoverie of the Manifold Corruptions of the Holy Scriptures by the Heretikes of our Daies</span> (1582) accused protestants of doubting or denying the authority of books and passages not harmonious with their doctrine; of altering the text to justify their views; and of translating falsely to substantiate heretical ideas. The subsequent controversy involved Cartwright, Fulke, Whitaker, John Reynolds, and his Catholic brother William.<br>
<br>Martin worked on a third manuscript between July 1580 and April 1581. <span class="italic">Roma sancta</span> lauded the holiness and piety of contemporary Rome as evidence for the truth of Catholicism. Apparently the English College's poor finances prevented its publication. Sections were published in <span class="italic">A Treatyse of Christian Peregrination</span> (1583), along with three letters to &#145;heretics&#146;: a married priest; Martin's sisters, raised in heresy and married to protestants; and Thomas Whyte, warden of New College, Oxford, who dissembled his Catholic beliefs to retain his position. The epistles were reprinted as <span class="italic">The Love of the Soule</span> (1578, <i>vere</i> England, <i>c</i>.1597).<br>
<br>At an unspecified date Martin began to suffer from a malady of the lungs, most probably consumption. On 30 April 1582 Allen sent him to Paris to consult doctors. Apparently it was too late for medical help. He returned to Rheims on 14 September and died on 28 October. Allen preached at Martin's funeral. Martin was buried in the parish church of St &Eacute;tienne. The armies of the French Revolution destroyed the church and his monument.<br>
