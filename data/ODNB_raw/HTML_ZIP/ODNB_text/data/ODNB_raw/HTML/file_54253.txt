<span class="headword">Lennox family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;1425), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was established in the twelfth century in the region from which it was named, in the south-western highlands of Scotland, but became of national importance only at the end of the thirteenth century, with <a name="cosubject_16457"></a><span class="headword">Malcolm Lennox</span>, fifth earl of Lennox  (<em>d.</em> 1333)<span class="occ"></span>. Having probably succeeded his father and namesake in the early 1290s, the younger Malcolm became a committed supporter of Robert Bruce in his attempt to revive an independent Scottish kingship in the early months of 1306. He attended Robert's enthronement on 25 March and shared fully in the misfortunes of the new king's allies in the years immediately following. The earldom of Lennox was forfeited to Edward I, who assigned it to his principal supporter in the Firth of Clyde, Sir John Menteith. The defeat of Robert's forces at the battles of Methven and Dalry in summer 1306 reduced Malcolm to the status of a fugitive; John Barbour's <span class="italic">Bruce</span> preserves a tale of his narrow escape when the Scottish king and his men were being pursued by sea in the Firth of Clyde. However, the earl's fortunes recovered as a result of Robert I's increasingly successful military and political campaigns from 1307 onwards. Lennox was with Robert on campaigns in the west during 1308, and appended his seal to the letter sent by the nobles of Scotland to the king of France in the first parliament of the reign in March 1309. He was similarly one of the signatories of a more famous diplomatic communication, the so-called &#145;declaration of Arbroath&#146; sent by the Scottish nobility to Pope John XXII in 1320.<br>
<br>Although never one of the major beneficiaries of Robert I's patronage, Malcolm Lennox received a number of important grants from him, including that of the hereditary sheriffdom of Clackmannan in 1309 and above all the sheriffdom and castle of Dumbarton, the principal stronghold in the area of his earldom, in 1321. After Robert's death in 1329 Malcolm apparently remained loyal to his infant son, David II. On 19 July 1333 pro-Bruce forces attempting to relieve an English siege of Berwick were badly defeated at the battle of Halidon Hill. English chroniclers record the earl of Lennox among the Scottish casualties.<br>
<br>Malcolm Lennox was succeeded by <a name="cosubject_54250"></a><span class="headword">Donald Lennox</span>, sixth earl of Lennox  (<em>d.</em> 1361<span class="mult">x</span>4)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of his marriage to a woman named Margaret, said to have been a sister or daughter of an earl of Mar. Donald issued a number of charters dealing with lands and offices within the Lennox, but played little part in the wider affairs of the kingdom. In September 1357 he was one of the Scottish magnates who agreed to the ransom arrangements for David II, captured by the English at the battle of Nevilles Cross in 1346 (in which Donald himself took no part). Otherwise little is known of his activities. He seems to have died between 2 May 1361 and 20 November 1364. The identity of his wife is unknown. He had no surviving sons and was succeeded as <i>suo jure</i> countess by his daughter <a name="cosubject_54251"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Lennox</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1392)<span class="occ"></span> and her husband, <a name="cosubject_54252"></a><span class="headword">Walter Faslane</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1392)<span class="occ"></span>, who is referred to as earl of Lennox in an indenture of 20 November 1364, but who thereafter used the courtesy title &#145;lord&#146; of Lennox. Margaret's marriage to Walter was probably concluded in the 1340s and may well have been designed to keep the earldom in the comital family, since he was a descendant of Alwin, second earl of Lennox (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1214&times;17), and as such the head of a major cadet branch of the Lennox kindred. From about the time of his marriage, Walter may have been treated as Donald's <i>de facto</i> heir, explaining why he witnessed many of the earl's charters and received grants of important offices within the earldom.<br>
<br>As &#145;lord&#146; of Lennox Walter Faslane attended the coronation of Robert II on 26 March 1371 but was not particularly prominent in the governance of the kingdom thereafter. Towards the end of his life his hold on the earldom may have been challenged by his son <a name="cosubject_54253"></a><span class="headword">Duncan Lennox</span>, eighth earl of Lennox  (<em>d.</em> 1425)<span class="occ"></span>. In 1385 Walter and Margaret resigned the earldom in favour of Duncan, who received a great seal charter confirming the arrangement and began to use the title earl of Lennox. The resignation may not have been entirely voluntary, or some aspects of the new arrangement may have displeased Walter and Margaret, for in August 1388 they repeated their resignation of the earldom in Duncan's favour, but this time reserving their &#145;liferent&#146; rights in the Lennox. Duncan may have achieved an uncontested supremacy in the Lennox only after the deaths of his parents, in both cases before 17 February 1392.<br>
<br>Duncan's career as eighth earl was dominated by his increasingly close links to the family of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany. By the early 1390s he had no legitimate male heirs (though he had four illegitimate sons), but did have three legitimate daughters, probably born of his marriage to Helen Campbell, daughter of the Campbell lord of Lochawe, for which he obtained papal approval in 1373. On 17 February 1392 Duncan entered into a contract for the marriage of his eldest daughter, Isabel, to Robert Stewart's eldest son, Murdoch. By the terms of the contract Isabel and Murdoch and their successors were recognized as heirs to the earldom should Duncan fail to produce any legitimate male heirs before his death. On 8 November 1392 Robert III gave his consent to the entailing of Lennox in favour of Murdoch Stewart and his heirs. The entailing arrangement (which ruled out the possibility of the earldom being partitioned between Duncan's daughters) tied Lennox to one of the most powerful figures in the kingdom, for Albany was first guardian of the kingdom for the incapacitated Robert III from 1402 until the latter's death in 1406, and then, as a result of the capture of the heir to the throne, Prince James, by the English in the same year, governor of Scotland. When the duke died in 1420, Duncan's son-in-law Murdoch succeeded his father as both duke of Albany and governor.<br>
<br>Earl Duncan's close connection to the Albany Stewart family eventually proved his undoing, as he was caught up in the bitter political dispute between the Albanys and King James I after the latter was released from English captivity in 1424. At the forefront of resistance to James was Duncan's grandson Walter Stewart, who had built a personal following in the earldom of Lennox and had been opposed to the entire idea of negotiating James's release. Walter, whose increasingly rebellious courses did much to undermine his father's position, was arrested on the king's orders in May 1424, and before January 1425 James had also detained Earl Duncan and imprisoned him in Edinburgh Castle. In March 1425 Duncan's daughter Isabel and his son-in-law Murdoch were also taken into custody, and it became clear that the duke and his kinsmen were to face trial in a parliament called for May 1425. The king's actions provoked a rebellion in the Lennox led by another of Duncan's grandsons, James Stewart, who attacked the royal burgh and castle of Dumbarton on 3 May, although with limited success. On 25 May Duncan, Duke Murdoch, and Murdoch's son Alexander were tried in parliament at Stirling, convicted, and summarily executed; Walter Stewart had suffered the same fate on the previous day. Earl Duncan was reputed to be over eighty years of age at the time of his execution. According to a later chronicler all four men were buried in the Dominican friary in Stirling.<br>
<br>Earl Duncan's daughter Isabel recovered control of the earldom of Lennox after James I's death in 1437. She died about 1458, without legitimate heirs, and the comital title was eventually claimed by the descendants of Duncan's second daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, John Stewart of Darnley. Their grandson, another John Stewart, was acknowledged as earl in 1488.<br>
