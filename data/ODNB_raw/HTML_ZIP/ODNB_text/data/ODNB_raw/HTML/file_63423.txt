<span class="headword">Tanner, Sir  Henry</span>  (1849&#150;1935), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in St Pancras, London, in 1849 and baptized there on 14 December 1849 the son of Robert Tanner (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1820&#150;1853), master carpenter, and his wife, Elizabeth Selby (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1820, <i>d</i>. after 1891). He attended the Royal Academy Schools, and obtained practical experience on building sites in Wiltshire and Surrey before entering the architectural office of Anthony Salvin. He also attended the Architectural Association's classes, winning a sessional prize for the best series of papers on construction. In March 1871 he was appointed by competitive examination as clerk in the country district B (post and telegraph services) of HM office of works on a salary of &pound;100 p.a. &#145;Diligent, intelligent and thoroughly conversant with the duties of his profession&#146;  (TNA: PRO, WORK 22/9/7, fol. 11), he was promoted first assistant in April 1873 at &pound;210 p.a. He was twice married: in 1872 to Lucy (1848&#150;1889), daughter of William Gardner, with whom he had five sons and three daughters; and in 1894 to Emily Sophia, daughter of Josiah Leal.<br>
<br>In 1877 Tanner moved across to the London district of the office of works under John Taylor. The department's ever growing workload brought his promotion in 1882 to surveyor, second class, stationed at Leeds. In August 1884 he returned to London as first-class surveyor on an increased salary of &pound;800 p.a., with general responsibility for the post and telegraph services. Tanner reorganized his sector on a more systematic basis, with more regular and local supervision, achieving large reductions in maintenance costs. Applying for fellowship of the RIBA in 1891, Tanner stated that he had designed the York probate registry and post offices at York (1885; his first major postal building), Bradford, Halifax, Liverpool, Barrow in Furness, Leicester, Birmingham, and many other towns, as well as major Post Office buildings in London&#151;which included the savings bank in Carter Lane (1890&#150;94). His designs were often in a classical style, frequently of French Renaissance derivation, but sometimes in a formal Tudor or Jacobean. In 1892 he was engaged on designs for new post offices at Liverpool, Nottingham, and Cardiff. There was also much extending and remodelling of existing buildings. On the completion of the &#145;commodious and imposing&#146; General Post Office (north), St Martin's-le-Grand, London (cost &pound;220,000), the postmaster-general praised its design and arrangement as &#145;admirably adapted to the requirements of the Public Service&#146;  (TNA: PRO, WORK 22/9/7, fol. 44, 14 Nov 1895).<br>
<br>When Sir John Taylor retired in 1898, Tanner succeeded as principal surveyor of the office of works (&pound;1200 p.a.), responsible for final approval of all major designs before they were submitted to the minister. He undertook the vast Post Office Savings Bank at Hammersmith (1899&#150;1903) and the massive Jacobean Land Registry (1900&#150;06) in Lincoln's Inn Fields. For his realization that &#145;a building should be designed for the work for which it is intended&#146; he was regarded as &#145;a first-rate planner&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 3rd ser., 18, 1910&#150;11, 170). Taylor remained however as consultant architect&#151;not altogether to Tanner's delight&#151;for the great wave of building new public offices, work initially allotted to private architects by competition. But Brydon, architect of the Great George Street offices (now the Treasury), died in 1901, his plans just completed: Tanner executed them, effecting drastic economies; his primary contribution was structural, employing steel framing, but he made some changes in the external design; he also executed the St James's Park extension in 1908&#150;15, introducing further modern construction methods. At the same time he designed and executed the west extension (1908&#150;12) of the law courts in the Strand, a work closely in sympathy with G. E. Street's adjoining main block. By 1910 the department's work had so increased that Tanner was almost breaking down under the burden; additional staff enabled him to concentrate on supervising design.<br>
<br>Tanner's interest in construction made him quick to appreciate the merits of reinforced-concrete framing. In 1907 he chaired a major committee on reinforced concrete, declaring that &#145;reinforced concrete would have to be used&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 3rd ser., 12, 1904&#150;5, 503). As the office of works was free of the building controls hindering use of the new technique, he seized on its economies of space and money for his crowning achievement, the King Edward Building of the General Post Office (1907&#150;10; &pound;323,000), &#145;the largest Post Office in the world &hellip; [and] the largest building &hellip; carried out in ferro-concrete&#146;  (ibid., 172). Employing Hennebique's patented system which provided shear reinforcement in concrete beams, thereby establishing full reinforced-concrete framing for buildings, he saved &pound;60,000 compared with a steel-frame construction. Tanner's lead was &#145;of great value&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 1160), though the short street fa&ccedil;ades were of stone, and the constructional framework was expressed only in the loading bay. Tanner served as president of the Concrete Institute, and was a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers that developed from it; he was also sometime chairman of the Royal Sanitary Institute.<br>
<br>Tanner had been elected an associate of the RIBA in 1876 and a fellow in 1891. He won the RIBA's Tate prize for a classical architectural design in 1878, and throughout his career stressed his design role; in 1901 his title was changed from &#145;principal surveyor&#146; to &#145;principal architect and surveyor&#146; as more accurate terminology. But although he received gratuities at the rate of about three-quarters of one per cent on major new works, rewards were much greater in private practice. He was knighted in 1904. After retiring from the office of works at the end of 1913 (though he continued to supervise the Great George Street offices), this indefatigable man joined his son's architectural firm, which he attended daily until his death.<br>
<br>Frank-looking, with upturned nose, Tanner wore a full but trimmed beard and moustache; he was known for his extraordinary memory. He died on the doorstep of his house, 31 Rosslyn Hill, Hampstead, London, &#145;when returning home from business&#146; on 2 September 1935  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Sept 1935), and was buried three days later at Elmers End cemetery, Beckenham, Kent, near his home of the 1880s and 1890s. He left an estate valued at under &pound;14,000. He was survived by his widow and his eldest son, Henry (1876&#150;1947). Assisted by his brothers Hugh and Edwin, and, as mentioned above, by his father from 1914, the younger Henry Tanner maintained an important commercial architectural practice, including large blocks in Regent Street (Sir Henry had served on the Plymouth committee of 1913 to determine their general character), hotels for John Lyons &amp; Co., Park Lane Hotel (1928; attributed to Sir Henry), and National House in Moorgate.<br>
