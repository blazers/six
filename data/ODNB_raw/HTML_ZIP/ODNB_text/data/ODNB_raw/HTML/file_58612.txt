<span class="headword">Galway,  Mary</span>  (1864/5&#150;1928), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born in Moira, co. Down, the daughter of a linen weaving family. Nothing else is known about her early life, but the family moved to Belfast about the 1870s and Mary Galway worked as a machinist in the city's linen industry for at least eleven years.<br>
<br>Mary Galway became involved in trade unionism from the 1890s and by the summer of 1897 she was appointed general secretary of the Textile Operatives' Society of Ireland (1893), a position she held until her death. In 1894 the Irish Trade Union Congress (ITUC) was formed in Dublin. Mary Galway first attended the congress in 1898 and was the only woman delegate consistently to attend the congress in its first two decades. From 1907 Galway was elected annually to the parliamentary committee, which was also the congress executive. She became vice-president of the ITUC in 1910, the only vice-president never to become the president the following year.<br>
<br>Through the Textile Operatives' Union Mary Galway attempted to organize linen workers, the majority of whom were women, often the main breadwinners for their families. This was an extremely difficult task owing to the nature of the relationship between employers and employees in the north. Often employers were paternalistic, providing houses and other services for their workers, expecting absolute loyalty in return. Linen strikes tended to result in a lock-out or the replacement of workers by machinery or by other workers from the area. Mary Galway became the sole organizer for women linen workers in the city of Belfast. It was a demanding role, as only about five per cent of linen workers had joined the union by 1910. Her greatest success was in organizing skilled weavers rather than the unskilled workers in the linen mills. The fact that Galway targeted the more skilled linen weavers led to lack of support for her among the unskilled women workers, who eventually asked James Connolly (1868&#150;1916) to organize them, much to Mary Galway's anger.<br>
<br>Mary Galway was regarded as a moderate in trade union circles and she strongly opposed the radical trade unionism of James Larkin (1876&#150;1947) and James Connolly. She was a close political ally of the Belfast trade unionist William Walker (1871&#150;1918). Her union was strong in some small Belfast factories and succeeded in improving working conditions. However, in the larger factories, where the union was weak, threatened strike action produced lock-outs.<br>
<br>When Connolly arrived in Belfast in 1910 as an organizer for Larkin's Transport Union, Mary Galway, along with Walker and a number of other Belfast trade unionists, was suspicious of the political agenda which lay behind the union's activities. Galway and Connolly became embroiled in an inter-union dispute during the linen strike of 1911. Those unskilled workers who did not belong to Galway's union had approached Connolly to organize them. Connolly told the girls to seek Galway's advice but she showed little sympathy for their cause. Connolly therefore began to organize them, which led to the formation of a rival union for women in Belfast. Mary Galway believed this to be detrimental to the workers' cause and, accusing Connolly of poaching, she took her case to the trades council. The debate in council exposed the political differences between the Belfast trade unionists and Connolly. Galway called Connolly &#145;an adventurer &hellip; coming to a city to wreck a trade union that has done incalculable good&#146;  (Belfast Trades Council minutes, 2 Nov 1911). The council came to no decision on the dispute.<br>
<br>Mary Galway was a well-known figure in Belfast and acted as a negotiator during the 1906 linen strike and also in the campaign to improve home workers' pay and conditions in 1910&#150;11. Between 1908 and 1912 she contributed to a number of parliamentary committees investigating the linen trade, most notably the inquiries into truck payments (1908) and conditions in the linen industry (1912) which resulted in the setting up in 1915 of a trade board for outworkers or home workers. She was also instrumental in having the first woman factory inspector appointed to Ireland.<br>
<br>After 1913 Mary Galway ceased to hold a prominent position in the Irish TUC, although she remained general secretary of the Textile Operatives' Union. She died at 31 Crocus Street, Belfast on 26 September 1928.<br>
