<span class="headword">Stanford, Sir  William</span>  (1509&#150;1558), <span class="occ">judge and legal writer</span>, was born on 20 August 1509, the second son of William Stanford, mercer, of London, and Margaret Gedney (<i>d</i>. 1541). He is said by Wood to have been &#145;among the Oxonians&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.262) before proceeding, doubtless via an inn of chancery, to Gray's Inn in 1528. He was called to the bar before 1536 (when he was elected an ancient at the age of twenty-seven), and began to practise in the beginning of Lent 1539, earning &pound;36 in fees in his first year and nearly &pound;52 in his second. One of his first appointments in the 1530s was as steward of St Mary's College, Stafford. Staffordshire was the county of his father's origin, and of his ancestors, and in 1541 (and 1545) he was elected to parliament for Stafford, in 1547 for Newcastle under Lyme. Several of his early clients were from Lancashire, and he practised at Lancaster assizes in the early 1540s. In 1542 he was appointed attorney-general to the newly established court of general surveyors of crown lands, and obtained a grant of arms; in the following year he became a justice of the peace for Middlesex. By 1543 he was earning over &pound;100 a year in private practice, besides his stipend of &pound;40.<br>
<br>In 1543, according to a note in his fee book, Stanford entered the service of Lord Chancellor Wriothesley, who is known to have been his patron. This perhaps refers to his work as a commissioner for the sale of crown lands. He became a bencher of Gray's Inn in 1545, when he read on the statute <span class="roman">34 Edw. III c. 12</span>, concerning forfeiture for treason. His double reading, in 1551, was probably on <span class="roman">Westminster I c. 1</span>, concerning justices of the peace, though it has also been suggested that he read on <span class="italic">Prerogativa regis</span>. Notwithstanding the fall of Wriothesley, and his religious leanings towards Rome, in November 1552 he was created serjeant-at-law. His fee book shows that in his first year as a serjeant his income from fees rose to &pound;315 a year; many of his clients were from Lancashire. On 19 October 1553 Mary I appointed him one of the queen's serjeants, and in that capacity he undertook with due fairness, but unsuccessfully, the prosecution of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554. About Michaelmas 1554 he became a justice of the common pleas, and he remained in that position until his death on 28 August 1558, receiving a knighthood in 1555. He was buried on 29 August at Hadley, Middlesex, where his funerary tabard and penons were still on display in the following century. Besides his property in Hadley, Islington, and other parts of Middlesex, he left estates that he had acquired in Staffordshire. To Sir James Dyer he bequeathed &#145;a gilt cup with the cover called the Maudelyn box&#146;. He was survived by his widow, Alice, daughter of John Palmer of Kentish Town, Middlesex, with whom he had six sons&#151;the eldest of whom, Robert, took the family back to Staffordshire and represented that county in the first parliament of James I&#151;and five or six daughters. Dame Alice (<i>d</i>. 1573) later married Roger Carew of Hadley.<br>
<br>Stanford is remembered in the legal profession for two important books, one of which is still sometimes cited in the courts. Coke supports the supposition that the first printed edition of <span class="italic">Glanvill</span> was published in 1554 &#145;by the perswasion and procurement of Sir William Stanford, a grave and learned judge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fourth Institute</span>, 345, margin). The greatest of his own books was <span class="italic">Les plees del coron</span> (1557), a textbook on criminal law. It was heavily based on the material gathered in the title &#145;Corone&#146; in Fitzherbert's <span class="italic">Graunde Abridgment</span>, arranged in chapters, in the form of a continuous text, with passages quoted from Glanvill, Bracton, and relevant acts of parliament. It was the first legal textbook in England to adopt the practice of citing specific authorities for every proposition, and as such had a major influence on legal literature, though it lacked the elemental clarity of Littleton's <span class="italic">Tenures</span>, which was written by a judge of the same court a century earlier.<br>
<br>Stanford's other principal book was his <span class="italic">Exposicion of the Kinges Prerogative</span>, written in 1548 and dedicated to Sir Nicholas Bacon as attorney of the wards. It was not printed until 1567, though there is an incomplete manuscript version of similar date in the British Library (Harley MS 854). This treatise seems to have had its roots in the readings on <span class="italic">Prerogativa regis</span>, even if not a reading by Stanford himself, and is concerned with the property rights of the crown rather than with constitutional principles. Unlike the former work, it was written in English. It also drew a great deal on Fitzherbert, and the author expressed the hope that others would take different titles in the abridgement and subject them to the same analytical treatment, though he had no immediate followers apart from Simon Theloall on writs. Fulbeck justly said of Stanford's books in 1600 that they were of:<blockquote>force and weight, and no common kind of stile; in matter none hath gone beyond him, in method none hath overtaken him. And surely his method may be a law to the writers of the law which shall succeed him. (Fulbeck, 72&#150;3)</blockquote>Both works enjoyed several editions down to 1607, when they were printed together.<br>
