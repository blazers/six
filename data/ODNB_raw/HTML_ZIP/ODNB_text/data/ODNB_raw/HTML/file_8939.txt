<span class="headword">Evans,  Abel</span>  (1675&#150;1737), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, son of Abel Evans and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spalding (<i>bap</i>. 1638?), was baptized at St Mary, Whitechapel, Stepney, on 26 February 1675. He entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 11 March 1685, matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, on 2 July 1692, and proceeded to the degrees of BA in 1696, MA on 23 March 1700, BD on 26 April 1705, and DD on 16 May 1711. He was ordained in 1700 and presented to the college living of St Mary's, Kirtlington, near Oxford, but retained his college fellowship until 1724. He resigned Kirtlington on 4 June 1707.<br>
<br>Evans's low-church sermon at the university church on 23 August 1705 vexed the Oxford tories, but its praise of the duke of Marlborough earned him the favour of the duchess, who sent him a gift of venison. In December 1706 he further antagonized colleagues by publicly reflecting upon the president and most of the fellows of his college, for which he was deprived on 20 February 1707 of the chaplaincy which he had held for only eight months.<br>
<br>About 1709 Evans fell into line with the preponderant toryism and high-churchmanship of Oxford, was reinstated in his college chaplaincy (which he held until February 1713), and served at various later times as senior bursar, dean of divinity, and vice-president. As a tory he also wrote <span class="italic">The Apparition</span>, &#145;a dialogue betwixt the Devil and a Doctor concerning the rights of the Christian Church&#146;, published in January 1710. This long satire in heroic couplets against Matthew Tindal, the deist, was popular enough to run into four authorized editions and five piracies.<br>
<br>Evans's <span class="italic">Vertumnus</span> (June 1713), an epistle in octosyllabic couplets to Jacob Bobart (1641&#150;1719), the botanist, is shorter and more agreeable. The modern attribution of a Miltonic imitation, <span class="italic">Pre-Existence</span> (1714), to Evans is highly unlikely  (Chapin, 178&#150;80).<br>
<br>On 31 July 1713 Evans was presented to the college living of St Giles', Oxford. Thomas Hearne noted the politics of his sermons, from ultra-toryism on 25 September 1715, when Evans hinted that George I was a usurper, to &#145;a most vile, Whiggish Sermon&#146; on 30 January 1719  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 5.121, 6.294). Hearne concluded that Evans was seeking preferment from the whigs, but in the event Evans's college remained his only ecclesiastical patron. It provided him with the vicarage of St Andrew, Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire, where he was incumbent from 3 January to 6 December 1723, and the rectory of St Dunstan, Cheam, Surrey, to which he was presented on 31 May 1724 and where in less than three years he was &#145;at odds wth all his Parish, &amp; talks of Law, but is yet got no farther than Epigrams&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Edward Young</span>, 54).<br>
<br>Evans is remembered as an epigrammatist, though the originality of his well-known epitaph on Vanbrugh beginning &#145;Lie heavy on him, Earth&#146; has been questioned; also as the admirer and friend of Alexander Pope, who praised him in <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>  (1728, 2.108). Although the Cheam benefice had been held by no fewer than five bishops, Evans was still rector when he died there on 18 October 1737; he was buried there four days later. He never married. He was survived by two widowed sisters and a niece, who administered his estate. Six naturalized, &#145;realistic&#146; pastorals by Evans, variously dated from 1707 to 1726, were first printed in volume 5 of Nichols's <span class="italic">Select Collection of Poems</span> (1782); they were from a manuscript, now lost, which, it seems, contained at least thirteen pastorals.<br>
