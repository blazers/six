<span class="headword">Hammond,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1658), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and regicide</span>, was the third son among the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12160/', "Dr John Hammond (c.1555&#150;1617)")</script>, physician to the royal household under James I, and his wife, Mary (or Marie) Harrison. Thomas's eldest brother, Robert, was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12161/', "Lieutenant-Colonel Robert (Robin) Hammond")</script>, Charles I's gaoler in the Isle of Wight during 1647&#150;8, and Oliver Cromwell's cousin through the Hampden family. His youngest brother was the eminent Anglican divine <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12157/', "Henry Hammond")</script>. His only sister, Mary (or Marie), married Sir John, father of the more famous Sir William Temple. The family had a country seat at Chertsey in Surrey, and by the time of his death in 1617 Hammond's father was clearly a wealthy man, giving generously to charity as well as providing for his widow and children, Thomas's share being a lease worth &pound;40 per annum and a legacy of &pound;200.<br>
<br>Nothing certain is known of Hammond's career from then until the eve of the civil war, but he must have seen military service in the continental wars, either in the Netherlands or Germany, since he was a trained gunnery officer before 1642. Why he took the side of parliament against the king must remain surmise, unless explained by family connections and/or religious commitment. Evidence of his radicalism is found in 1644 when, as lieutenant-general of the ordnance in the army of the eastern association, he testified against his own commander-in-chief, Edward Montagu, second earl of Manchester, in the latter's celebrated clash with his lieutenant-general of horse, Oliver Cromwell. It is not surprising that Hammond was appointed to the corresponding post in the New Model Army from the spring of 1645.<br>
<br>Hammond was among the politically active officers of 1647&#150;9, serving on the small standing committee to which Sir Thomas Fairfax handed over control of issuing all commissions, and acting as a spokesman for the high command in their successive dealings with the parliament, the king, and the radicals in the army itself (the agitators and their Leveller allies). He was named to the high court of justice in January 1649, attending no fewer than fourteen of its sittings, including the occasion on which judgment was given against the king; he did not, however, sign the death warrant, though there is no corroborative evidence for the statement that he positively refused to do so, and in 1660&#150;61 he was clearly regarded&#151;albeit posthumously&#151;as having been a regicide [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>].<br>
<br>Hammond did not go on the Irish expedition of 1649, but remained on active service; unlike Fairfax he took part in the pre-emptive invasion of Scotland the following year. Like Cromwell, he fell seriously ill in that country and his health appears to have been permanently shattered. Hammond retired from his military position in the course of 1651&#150;2, but continued to be much preoccupied with the pay arrears due to himself and the other personnel of the artillery train from his years of service. He received a grant of Irish lands, having been an &#145;adventurer&#146; for &pound;200 back in 1642. The artillery men received grants of former crown lands in Middlesex and Surrey in settlement of their arrears; his own share was the royal manor of Byfleet, only 4 miles from his family's seat in Chertsey. He had already acquired, in 1647&#150;8, some previously episcopal lands in settlement of earlier debts owing to him on the public faith.<br>
<br>Hammond had a brush with the Commonwealth's accounts committee in 1651, but protested that he had accounted fully and properly for all the sums which he had received in all the three armies in which he had served; he pointed out that his account from July 1649 onwards was with the army in Scotland, where by this time George Monck had succeeded him as lieutenant-general of the ordnance. He was still acting as a trustee for the officers and men of the artillery train when additional compensation was voted out of crown lands in the act of 1652; a misleading reference from May of that year has led some authorities to assume that Hammond was dead by then.<br>
<br>Hammond was clearly in very poor health when he made his will in 1657, and he died in 1658, not long before the protector, his old colleague and then commander. The liberal if optimistic provisions for his family made in his will (proved 27 April 1658) were all destroyed by the events of 1660. The former church and crown lands which he had acquired were automatically forfeit; the residue of his property was confiscated by his retrospective attainder as a regicide. His widow, Martha, and seven surviving children must have had to make their own ways in the world, unless they received help from their in-laws, the Temple family, after whom one of Hammond's sons was named. His famous Anglican brother had died on the eve of the Restoration.<br>
