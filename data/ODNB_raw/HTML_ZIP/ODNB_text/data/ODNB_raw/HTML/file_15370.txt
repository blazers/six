<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Gilbert</span>  (1678&#150;1745), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster</span>, son of Gilbert Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1689), who was successively minister of Girvan, Ayrshire, and Dundonald, co. Down, was born at Dundonald. In 1697 he entered the University of Glasgow. He was probably in Ireland by late 1701 and was licensed by the presbytery of Armagh on 17 November 1701. On 23 March 1704 he was ordained by the presbytery of Armagh as minister of the united charges of Donaghcloney and Tullylish, and, during the first subscription controversy, soon became one of the most prominent men on the orthodox side in the synod of Ulster. In 1720 he was elected its moderator. He was probably the author of <span class="italic">New Light Set in a Clear Light</span> (1721), published anonymously in Belfast, which was intended as a reply to the <span class="italic">Religious Obedience Founded on Personal Persuasion</span> of John Abernethy, and James Kirkpatrick's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Presbyterian Ministers in the North of Ireland</span>. In 1724 was published <span class="italic">A Defence of the Principles and Conduct of the General Synod of Ulster</span>. It was a reply to Samuel Haliday's <span class="italic">Reasons Against the Imposition of Subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith</span>, and appears to have been the work of several hands, but Kennedy's name alone appears on the title-page. In 1727 he issued <span class="italic">A Daily Directory Enlarged</span> which expanded on the devotional work of the same title published in 1680 by Sir William Waller, the parliamentarian general. It was several times republished. <span class="italic">The Narrative of the Non-Subscribers Examined</span> (1731) has also been attributed to Kennedy, but on insufficient evidence. A long correspondence between him and John Abernethy is among Wodrow's papers in the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh. Kennedy married Elizabeth, daughter of the Revd George Lang of Newry; they had four sons and three daughters. He died on 8 July 1745, probably at Tullylish, where he was buried.<br>
