<span class="headword">Luke,  Frederic Davey <span class="st"> [David]</span></span>  (1921&#150;2005), <span class="occ">German scholar and translator</span>, was born at Emsworth, Linden Road, Clevedon, Somerset, on 13 June 1921, the son of Thomas Davey Luke, a doctor, and his wife, Jane Thompson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pattison. His father died young, and Luke (known in the family as Derek, to everyone else as David) was brought up by his mother and an elder sister. He was educated at Sedbergh School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where, exempted from military service, he took a first in modern languages in 1944, and a DPhil on the French symbolist poet Rimbaud in 1947. His career was shaped by a bizarre chance, when in 1947 his application for a French lecturership at Manchester was pre-empted by the offer of a less obviously relevant post in German. He occasionally expressed regret at the diversion. In 1959 he returned to Oxford to become student (fellow and tutor) in German at Christ Church.<br>
<br>In these early years Luke published only the occasional article&#151;on Kafka, or Nietzsche. He was confessedly inhibited by the formal requirement to assimilate all previous scholarship on a topic before advancing one's own views. He made a pilgrimage to Z&uuml;rich to ask Emil Staiger, author of an authoritative three-volume study of Goethe, how he had come to terms with 150 years of secondary literature. Meantime he was a devoted and effective tutor and a much appreciated, idiosyncratic lecturer, as recorded by a review for the undergraduate journal <span class="italic">Isis</span> of his Nietzsche course by the later <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> humorist John Wells (never published, since the proctors put a stop to the series). Though occasionally driven to despair at the deficient motivation of some students, and to positive rage at basic failures of comprehension, he conscientiously helped the lame dog while inspiring the talented. He would spend evenings rereading texts for the next day's tutorials so as to give full value.<br>
<br>University teaching was then regarded as a respected activity for its own sake, with or without a research &#145;output&#146;. Yet it would have been sad if, apart from teaching, Luke's literary sensitivity and European breadth of reading had gone to waste. The riches were released when he turned to translating, especially verse. Goethe's <span class="italic">Roman Elegies</span> (1977), metrically simple and rhymeless, were followed by the immensely stiffer challenge of his <span class="italic">Faust</span> (part 1 1987, part 2 1995), whose variety of verse forms exhausts the repertoire: a challenge triumphantly met, as was that of Goethe's equally protean lyrical poetry  (<span class="italic">Selected Poems</span>, 1999). Stephen Spender's notion that Luke had improved on the originals was nonsense; but here indeed were poetic recreations that allowed English readers to experience direct the quality of one of Europe's greatest poets. The care and elegance of the introductions and notes fully measured up in the end to what is expected of &#145;secondary literature&#146;. Luke also translated narrative works by Kleist, Stifter, the brothers Grimm, and Thomas Mann, whose <span class="italic">Death in Venice</span> he, as a homosexual, regarded virtually as a sacred text. His achievements were recognized by German and European prizes. British research evaluation, however, discounted literary translation in favour of learned articles. Yet quite apart from the social and international value of opening windows on otherwise inaccessible cultures, and the much broader audience for foreign literary works as against the narrow readership of specialized journals, translation is at least as rigorous an activity as secondary writing, calling for all a scholar's capacities and more: a precise and loving understanding of the original, a highly developed stylistic judgement, and a delicate, often ingenious feel for the resources of English.<br>
<br>Luke's devotion to poetry made him a friend of W. H. Auden during the latter's tenure of the Oxford professorship of poetry in the late 1950s, and it was Luke's doing that Auden was allowed to live out his last years in the &#145;south brewhouse&#146; (later called the Auden cottage) in the shadow of his alma mater. Luke's other great love was music, especially opera, more especially Mozart and Wagner. He was also (in this respect a typical bachelor don) a lover of the table and of travel. He was a generous and delightful host, witty and wrily self-ironizing, inclined to half-comic rage when a new piece of the technical equipment to whose acquisition he was addicted could not be made to behave. He kept animals, first a cat (dogs being forbidden in colleges, unless, in one legendary instance, pragmatically renamed &#145;the dean's cat&#146;) then in retirement dogs. When his in-college cat Mowgli died, he drove to his cottage in the Scottish borders to bury him.<br>
<br>Luke stood at a mildly eccentric angle to the outside world. To go shopping with him was to witness cross-purposes over the simplest transaction. He could be awkward in academic matters too, but not by ill will, and in ways that did not lessen colleagues' affection. His closest colleague, the Christ Church French tutor Alban Krailsheimer, when asked why he put up with Luke's eccentricities without divorcing, answered: &#145;For the sake of the children&#146;. The humorous parallel hits off the educational values to which, under a sometimes blas&eacute; exterior, Luke too was committed. Variously influenced by Nietzsche's atheism, Goethe's secular humanism, and years of psychoanalysis, Luke went through phases of religious belief, the last being Russian Orthodox, it too finally abandoned. He died of pneumonia at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 5 December 2005.<br>
