<span class="headword">Dokett <span class="st"> [Doket]</span>,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1410&#150;1484), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was of uncertain origins, but there are indications from a pedigree of 1595, said in 1869 to be in the College of Arms, London, that he came of the Dukets of Grayrigg Hall, near Kendal, Westmorland, and was the second son of Sir Richard Duket of Grayrigg and Mabel Bellingham. Two of the quarterings of the Dokett arms in a late sixteenth- or early seventeenth-century light in the north-west window of the hall at Queens' College, Cambridge are arms of Bellingham and Burnishead, families in the same area. No academic record survives for Dokett, beyond the fact that in documents from at least 1439 onwards he is referred to as &#145;master&#146;. There is no evidence for Fuller's assertion that he was a Franciscan, the only basis for this being that he was admitted into confraternity with the Franciscan order in 1479.<br>
<br>Dokett's first recorded preferment was as vicar of St Botolph's Church, Cambridge, to which he was presented by Corpus Christi College in 1435 or 1436. In 1439 Dokett began a judicial process by which Barnwell Priory, the rector of St Botolph's by appropriation, was summoned by the bishop of Ely for neglect in maintaining the church, and subsequently renounced its rights as rector. Dokett was officially confirmed in that title on 21 October 1444, subject to the right of presentation remaining with Corpus Christi. He held the prebend of Ryton in Lichfield Cathedral from 1467 to 1470, when he exchanged it for the chancellorship of Lichfield, which he held until 1476. On 2 July 1470 he had resigned the rectory of St Botolph's.<br>
<br>While he was rector Dokett made those improvements to the church neglected by Barnwell, and used his wealth for the benefit of other local causes. He gave to the king a house in Milne Street (the present Queens' Lane), which was among property granted to Henry VI's new King's College in 1449; but his own great achievement in Cambridge was the establishment of Queens' College, which began its existence as the College of St Bernard in 1446. Property for its site was acquired partly through the benefactions of wealthy parishioners of St Botolph's. In August, September, and October 1446 one of these, Richard Andrew, conveyed two properties on the first site of the new college, between Milne Street and the present Trumpington Street (then High Street), to a fellow burgess, and to two clerks who were among the first four fellows of the college.<br>
<br>Andrew Dokett's endowment was mentioned in the first royal charter founding the college (3 December 1446), and he left it further benefactions of money and property in his will in 1461. In 1447 the original site was replaced by the present one, on the west side of Queens' Lane. Another burgess and parishioner, John Morris, donated his large messuage and garden to form the core of the new site, and another royal charter was issued on 21 August 1447. A third important parishioner was Reginald Ely, for whose soul Dokett left property by his will to establish a chantry in Queens' College. Ely was a master mason who was employed on the building of King's College, and was very likely responsible for the design of the Old Court at Queens'. After the granting of the charter Queen Margaret petitioned her husband that she might be founder of the new college, and letters patent refounding it in honour of St Margaret and St Bernard were granted on 30 March 1448. These named Andrew Dokett as president and the same four fellows mentioned in the first charter of December 1446. The queen granted her own charter of foundation, adding a dedication to the Trinity and the Virgin Mary, on 15 April.<br>
<br>The dedication of the college to St Bernard in all three foundations pointed clearly to the personal importance of Dokett, who besides being rector of St Botolph's governed St Bernard's Hostel, which occupied the site of the present New Court of Corpus Christi College. In 1458 a benefactor to Queens', Richard Withemarsh, received a life pension from the hostel in consideration of his donation; the upkeep of a lamp in Queens' College chapel given by another benefactor, Thomas Duffield, was to be met from the hostel rents. By Dokett's will 40<i>s</i>. annually from &#145;my hostel [<i>hospicium</i>] of St Bernard&#146; was allocated for bread, wine, wax, and lamp oil to use in Queens' College chapel. He also specified that, should a benefaction of rents made to Queens' by William Lasshby not fully materialize, any shortfall was to be made good from the hostel. Finally, after his death and that of his executors, the hostel and its rents were to pass to the college, and Queens' was duly to commemorate Dokett and other benefactors.<br>
<br>If Dokett's local interests were vital to the foundation of Queens', his court and other connections ensured its steady growth. Both Edward IV's queen, Elizabeth Woodville, its second royal founder, and Lady Margery Roos, a benefactor of the college, had been ladies of the bedchamber to Margaret, the first royal founder. Margery granted lands and manors in Essex, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdonshire to the college in and after 1469, and by her will in 1477 left plate to it. She also left &pound;10 and a covered vessel engraved with her husband's arms as a personal legacy to Dokett. When Queen Elizabeth officially assumed the title of founder of Queens' in 1475, Dokett was mentioned by name in the preface to the code of statutes then issued. It was stated to be at his request that Elizabeth, as &#145;true foundress&#146;, had drawn up statutes and ordinances for the foundation and establishment of the college.<br>
<br>Dokett's activity can be seen at a humbler level in negotiations for benefactions from citizens of London. Typically, as in the case of the chantry established in 1474 for Edmund Carvell, grocer, a sum of money would be handed to the college, in return for the commemoration of the benefactor at masses and prayers said by its priest&#150;fellows. In the same year Dokett himself received at London the last instalment of a payment of &pound;320 given by Dame Alice Wyche, widow successively of an alderman and a mercer of London, to buy lands in Lincolnshire. On 13 February 1478 a document was made at Westminster, witnessing that Dokett had received from Dame Elizabeth Yorke, widow of William Yorke of London, &pound;40 to endow masses for the souls of the Yorkes, their children, and friends.<br>
<br>Dokett left another memorial of his local wealth and his efforts on behalf of charity in Cambridge. He owned a house which backed onto the first site of Queens', and he converted this to provide almshouses for three poor women, who by his will were to pray for his soul and those of the benefactors of the college; like St Bernard's Hostel, the almshouses were to be managed after his death by his executors and after their deaths by Queens'. Dokett made his will on 2 November 1484 and died on 4 November; he was buried in Queens' College chapel. In his will Dokett instructed the fellows&#151;in so far as he was able&#151;to elect Thomas Wilkinson as his successor as president, another sign of his proprietorial interest. Jesus College, Cambridge, has a twelfth-century manuscript, including sermons of St Ambrose, owned by Dokett while he was rector of St Botolph's. He is also commemorated by his catalogue of the books in Queens' College Library, and by a half-length representation carved on a boss over the gateway into his college's Old Court.<br>
