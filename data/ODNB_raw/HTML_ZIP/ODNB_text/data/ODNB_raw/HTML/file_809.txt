<span class="headword">Aspull,  George</span>  (1813&#150;1832), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born in June 1813 in Manchester, the ninth of the ten sons of Thomas Aspull, an unsuccessful merchant who had turned to earning his living by teaching music and playing the violin. George Aspull began to learn the piano from his father in February 1821, and made such rapid progress that within four months he was playing Cramer's first study in C. His first public performance was in January 1822, when he played and sang with one of his brothers. In February 1823 Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Kalkbrenner, after hearing him play at Liverpool, advised his father to take him to London, which he did in April. Here he performed for Clementi, who was extremely impressed by his playing and called him a genius, although at the time he was too small to sit at the piano, and performed standing up. Rossini was equally impressed when Aspull played to him during the composer's first visit to England in December 1823. On 20 February 1824 Aspull was asked to perform for George IV at Windsor, where he played for over three hours, and accompanied himself singing while Princess Augusta turned the pages.<br>
<br>Aspull gave many concerts which attracted large audiences and enthusiastic reviews. &#145;That Master Aspull is a Musical Wonder, was the opinion of the whole room&#146;  (<span class="italic">Harmonicon</span>, April 1824). He was also compared by critics to the young Mozart. At a concert at Brighton he gave the first performance in England of Weber's <span class="italic">Konzertst&uuml;ck</span>. In April 1825 he and his father went to Paris, where they met Hummel and Ignaz Moscheles, and for the next six years he toured in Great Britain and Ireland. Besides performing on the piano, Aspull used to sing at his concerts. He had a sweet if not very powerful tenor voice, but Rossini advised that he should not sing much, &#145;for his soul is too much for his body&#146;. He wrote a little piano music and some songs; these were published after his premature death by his father, with a memoir, as <span class="italic">George Aspull's Posthumous Works for the Pianoforte</span> (1837).<br>
<br>Aspull died in Leamington on 19 August 1832 after catching a cold at Clementi's funeral. He was buried in Nottingham.<br>
