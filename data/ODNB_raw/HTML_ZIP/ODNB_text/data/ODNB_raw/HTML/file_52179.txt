<span class="headword">Gedney <span class="st"> [Brodyng]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1449), <span class="occ">draper and mayor of London</span>, is of unknown origins. In a petition to parliament in 1419 he styled himself John Brodyng, alias Gedney. He may have been related to two other John Gedneys recorded in early fifteenth-century London, one a clothworker, the other a grocer.<br>
<br>Gedney was trading in London by 1407, when he was already a man of substance. He sold cloth worth &pound;417 to the Grocers' Company for livery gowns and hoods between 1412 and 1422, and by 1420 supplied the royal wardrobe, often on long credit. By 1440 he was owed nearly &pound;490 for cloth by Henry VI. Gedney never plunged deeply into crown finance. In 1417 he lent &pound;20 for the French war. His later loans were mainly on this scale, but in 1431 he was one of four prominent citizens guaranteeing a loan of &pound;2000 on the security of the clerical subsidy. Gedney traded in Calais as well as in London, had links with Venetians and Genoese over the luxury trade in mercery, and imported woad through Southampton. Already a leading member of his livery by 1408, when he helped to acquire land for the new Drapers' Hall, he pledged &pound;20, the second largest amount, for the new building in 1419. In 1427&#150;8 he served as a warden, and, after the company received its charter in 1439, Gedney was the first master; he was again master in 1447&#150;8. Gedney arbitrated in many commercial disputes, but seems to have been drawn into the drapers' quarrel with the tailors in the 1440s to only a limited extent.<br>
<br>Gedney was returned to parliament in 1414 and 1432. His rise in city politics began in 1415. Elected alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without, Gedney took the oath only on threat of penalties, but remained an alderman until his death, for Coleman Street ward (1416&#150;35), and for Cornhill ward (1435&#150;49). He was a tax collector in 1416 and 1421, and auditor of London in 1419&#150;20. Gedney was elected sheriff in 1417&#150;18, and mayor for the first time in 1427&#150;8. He was one of only nine men to serve twice as mayor before 1545, his second term of office being in 1447&#150;8. Evidently an accomplished committee man with an interest in public works, he often attended the court of aldermen, and was present at eight parliamentary elections. In the 1440s he was an auditor of London Bridge's finances, and an adviser on the new granary being built in Leadenhall market. In 1445 he pledged a legacy of 200 marks (&pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) for the new conduit.<br>
<br>Most of Gedney's London property lay in the parish of St Christopher-le-Stocks in Cornhill and Broadstreet wards. By 1407 he held a reversionary interest in a messuage in Cornhill. In 1415 he obtained the Leaden Porch in Cornhill, described by John Stow in the sixteenth century as a fair, large house, together with shops. The purchase of a tavern, the Cock and Star on the Hoop, with six other messuages, shops, solars, and cellars, and an alley in the same parish, was finalized in 1437, but Gedney and his son, another John Gedney, who predeceased his father, were already enjoying the profits in 1436, when the income from Gedney's properties in London and Middlesex was assessed at the handsome sum of &pound;120.<br>
<br>Gedney's great prize in Middlesex was Tottenham Manor. He acquired the first of four sub-manors in 1427. By the 1440s he held the whole and ran the estate at a profit, consolidating the demesne, increasing rents, building two fulling mills, and founding a brickworks. Surpluses of over &pound;100 per annum are recorded in all surviving accounts for the manor between 1443 and 1449, showing its declared annual value of nearly &pound;60 at Gedney's death to have been a considerable underestimate. Gedney often acted as a trustee for Cardinal Beaufort and others, and this probably explains his interest in manors in Essex and property in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>Gedney was married three times, first to Alice (surname unknown), second to Elizabeth, sister of John Clopton, esquire, of Long Melford, Suffolk, and third, by 1444, to Joan Large (<i>d</i>. 1462). Joan was three times a widow. Her third husband, Robert Large, mercer, mayor of London and William Caxton's master, died in 1441. Gedney was a friend and business associate of Large, and one of his executors. The scandal caused by the marriage is recorded in a London chronicle under the year 1443&#150;4, in a version followed by Stow. Joan Large, perhaps for sound financial reasons, had broken her vow of chastity (no doubt undertaken to protect her late husband's inheritance) to marry Gedney; for this they were &#145;put to penance both he and she&#146; by the church authorities  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Digby Roll 2). Gedney's undertaking in 1445, to the bishop of London to fund four poor scholars at Oxford and Cambridge for nineteen and a half years, may be related to the marriage.<br>
<br>Gedney died on 12 February 1449. He was buried in the newly built lady chapel on the north side of St Christopher-le-Stocks, and Joan Large beside him. His will is lost, but some provisions are known. Besides money for the conduit, Gedney left 100 marks for glazing the west window of Guildhall chapel. The lavish perpetual chantry he wished to found in St Christopher's for himself, his three wives, and his dead son, was not yet in existence in 1483. John Clopton, one of Gedney's executors, included Gedney's portrait in stained glass among those he commissioned in Long Melford church, where it still survives.<br>
