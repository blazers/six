<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Steere,  Edward</span>  (1828&#150;1882), <span class="occ">bishop of central Africa</span>, son of William Steere of the chancery bar, and Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ball, his wife, was born in Charles Street, City Road, London, on 4 May 1828. He was educated in London first under Alexander Allen at Hackney and then from 1842 at University College School; he proceeded to University College in 1844 and graduated BA of the University of London in 1847, LLB in 1848, and LLD with gold medal for law in 1850, the year when he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. He also showed a liking for philosophy and theology, and came under the influence of the Tractarian revival.<br>
<br>Living chiefly in London, Steere was deeply impressed by the need for earnest work among the poor. To this end he organized the Brotherhood of St Mary, which in May 1854 joined a small society known as the Guild of St Alban. Steere had already learned the art of printing, and he set up a private press from which he issued the guild's monthly magazine. On receiving a small legacy from an uncle, later in 1854, he gave up his chambers, and in May 1855 he founded in connection with the guild a sort of brotherhood at The Spital, near Tamworth, Staffordshire. The scheme did not flourish, however, and in response to the appeals of friends he was ordained at Exeter Cathedral on 21 September 1856.<br>
<br>Steere's first curacy was at King's Kerswell, Newton Abbot, Devon. In the summer of 1858 he was invited to undertake the sole charge of Skegness and the curacy of Winthorpe, in Lincolnshire, by the vicar of Burgh-cum-Winthorpe, William George Tozer. He was admitted priest at Lincoln Cathedral. At Skegness, then a straggling village long without parochial care, Steere made his reputation among the fishermen as a &#145;downright shirt-sleeve man and a real <span class="roman">Bible</span> parson&#146;; the Wesleyans &#145;came to church in the morning to please him&#146;. In the autumn of 1859 he became rector of Little Steeping, at the foot of the Lincolnshire wolds. In the summer of 1858 he had married Mary Bridget, daughter of Henry Langford Brown of Barton Hall, King's Kerswell. She never accompanied him on his later travels abroad and died at Lincoln in 1883, leaving no children.<br>
<br>Towards the close of 1862 Steere obtained leave of absence in order to accompany his friend Tozer, the new missionary bishop of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), to the Shire. On 19 May 1863, after narrowly escaping being drowned, he landed at the mouth of the Zambezi. The newcomers failed to make much progress until in August 1864 they fixed their headquarters at Zanzibar, then the centre of the slave traffic. Here the missionary work was begun with a few slave boys, and by the middle of 1866 it had so well advanced that Steere was about to return home; at this point the bishop fell ill and was ordered to England. Steere was left in charge of the mission. Uneasy with English-language teaching, he had already compiled a handbook to the Swahili language, reduced to writing the dialect of the Usambara country, and produced a Shambala (Shambaa) grammar, which he printed with the aid of local boys. Having thus overcome the linguistic difficulties, he inaugurated a mission on the mainland; he arrived in August 1867 at Vuga (Vugha), the capital of the Usambara country. A year later he sailed for England.<br>
<br>On settling down again in Lincolnshire, Steere's spare time was at first entirely occupied with the Swahili translations for the Bible Society. At the church congress at Nottingham in 1871 he delivered an important address on the duty of the church regarding the slave trade. When news came in 1872 of Bishop Tozer's ill health, Steere volunteered to return to Zanzibar. He sailed in the <i>Abydos</i>, with the Livingstone search expedition, and instructed its members in the local African language. By December 1872, following Tozer's breakdown and departure, Steere was left almost alone to run the mission. Yet a year later he had made good progress both towards erecting an English cathedral on the site of what had formerly been the Zanzibar slave market, and in re-establishing the mission on the mainland at Magila.<br>
<br>Conscious that he lacked the money and Oxbridge connections characteristic of the mission, it was only after several refusals that Steere accepted nomination as bishop of central Africa; he returned to England and was consecrated at Westminster Abbey on 24 August 1874. The rest of that year was spent in gathering new workers and rousing fresh interest; based in Euston Square, London, he frequently lectured or preached in provincial towns. He left England on 11 February 1875. One of his earliest efforts, driven partly by his widely shared concern to stop the spread of Islam, was to bring the Nyasa district within his scope; he started his journey with a party but was compelled to continue alone, from the coast inland to Mwembe, the residence of Chief Mataka. The journey occupied him from August 1875 to February 1876. Later that year he visited one of the mainland missions, and started on the expedition which resulted in the founding of the Masasi station, from which he returned in ill health in January 1877. In February he sailed for England, and, once recovered, devoted himself with considerable success to promoting the mission. Sixty recruits joined the mission during his episcopate. At Oxford he was made DD; at Cambridge he was appointed Ramsden preacher.<br>
<br>Steere returned to Zanzibar in November 1877, and found the mission work steadily growing; but his own health was impaired, and he was worried by pecuniary difficulties. In 1879 he issued his complete translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and prayer book in Swahili, and on Christmas day of the same year he presided at the opening of the cathedral church at Zanzibar. In 1880 and 1881 he pressed on, though not in person, with the establishment of the mission settlement in the district near Lake Nyasa. Early in 1882 his health obliged him to return to England. He resumed work in August, but died of a stroke at Mkunazini, Zanzibar on 27 August. He was buried in Christ Church, Zanzibar.<br>
<br>Steere was a consistent high-churchman, but his width of view won the esteem of men of every persuasion. Insignificant and plain in appearance he was also a monotonous preacher, but he compensated for these disadvantages with his intellect, wit, and sympathy. His high reputation as a missionary was due in great measure to his building up and extending the mission, and to his versatility in throwing himself into all kinds of occupation, both practical and intellectual, the &#145;architect&#146; bishop scorning none of the industrial occupations he was anxious to teach the Africans. He also shared the concern, common among UMCA clergy, to preserve where possible the cultural identity of different African communities. His linguistic power was great; he carefully studied Swahili and Yao, and devoted much attention to other African languages; he also spoke French, German, and Portuguese, and had some acquaintance with Italian, Spanish, Arabic, and Hebrew, as well as Latin and Greek.<br>
<br>Besides editing Bishop Butler's <span class="italic">Analogy</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">Sermons and Remains</span> (1862), Steere displayed his theological and ecclesiastical interests in <span class="italic">An Essay on the Existence and Attributes of God</span> (1856), written originally for the Burnett treatise competition; <span class="italic">An Historical Sketch of English Brotherhoods</span> (1856); and <span class="italic">An Account of the Persecutions of the Early Church under the Roman Emperors</span> (1859; 2nd edn, 1880). Several lesser works related to the mission in central Africa. His laborious study of east African dialects resulted in <span class="italic">Short Specimens of the Vocabularies of &hellip; Gindo, Zaramo, and Angazidja</span> (1869), and collections for handbooks of several other languages: of Yao and of Nyamwezi in 1871, and of Makonde in 1876. But his chief attention was directed to the Swahili language, notably in his <span class="italic">Handbook of Swahili</span> (1870; 8th edn revised and enlarged by A. C. Madan, 1908). As well as his translation into Swahili of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and prayer book, he made revisions and also translated much of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, and various hymns and primers.<br>
