<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rhodes,  Cecil John</span>  (1853&#150;1902), <span class="occ">imperialist, colonial politician, and mining entrepreneur</span>, was born at Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire on 5 July 1853. He was the fifth son of Francis William Rhodes (1807&#150;1878), vicar of that parish from 1849 to 1876, and his second wife, Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1873), daughter of Anthony Taylor Peacock of South Kyme, Lincolnshire. The family consisted of nine sons, four of whom joined the army and two of whom died in infancy, and two daughters, both unmarried; one of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35732/', "Francis William (Frank) Rhodes (1851&#150;1905)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>As the son of a Church of England clergyman, the young Cecil Rhodes grew up in the reasonably comfortable country vicarage of Bishop's Stortford. For reasons that are unclear he did not follow his older brothers to Eton or Winchester colleges, but was sent in 1861 to the grammar school at Bishop's Stortford (then under the supervision of his somewhat forbidding father), where he completed his education. Wishing for a professional career, and perhaps hoping to acquire the social cachet of his public-school educated older brothers, he was determined to enter Oxford, but this ambition remained unfulfilled until he had begun to amass his African fortune. Instead, in 1871 the seventeen-year-old Rhodes, who had fallen ill in the previous year and who in any case had no vocation to become a clergyman, was dispatched, with &pound;2000 from his aunt, to join his eldest brother, Herbert, then growing cotton in the British colony of Natal. Although it is frequently suggested that he was sent to Natal to cure his consumptive lungs, recent accounts have followed his early biographer Sir Lewis Michell, who remarks that &#145;his father recognized that he was unfitted for a routine life in England, and resolved to ship him to one of the Colonies&#146;  (Michell, 1.21). In later life Rhodes's ill health was occasioned by a weak heart rather than weak lungs.<br>
<br>The decision to send Rhodes to Africa was fateful, if not particularly fortuitous: in 1870 southern Africa was on the eve of its mineral revolution and a period of turbulent economic and political change in which Rhodes was to play a major role. Late in 1870 diamonds, already being exploited along the river banks of the Vaal and Hartz rivers, were discovered on the four farms which were later to make up the Kimberley diamond fields. Five years after the discovery of the first alluvial diamonds in 1867 the region had become the largest producer of these gems the world had known. In 1871, in a series of moves which outraged colonial opinion, the British government first declared the diamond fields the territory of the Griqua under their chief, Nicolas Waterboer, and then annexed them in his name as the British crown colony of Griqualand West, ignoring the rival claims of the Afrikaner republics and the even more substantial claims of the region's indigenous Tswana inhabitants. This marked the beginnings of a new phase of aggressive imperial expansion in southern Africa. The British annexation of Griqualand West was based on dubious title, but the diamond fields were too tempting to allow for any wait upon legal niceties.<br>
<br>For Rhodes the first harbinger of these changes was the absence of his brother Herbert when he arrived at Durban harbour: in January 1871 Herbert had joined thousands of other fortune seekers at the recently discovered Griqualand West diamond fields. Although Cecil Rhodes spent his first year attempting to grow cotton, hoping to use the proceeds to take himself to Oxford, his first crop failed and the second, while more successful, sold for a poor price. By October 1871 he too was on his way to the diamond diggings, riding across the Drakensberg on a pony, the ox-cart behind containing&#151;in addition to his necessary supplies&#151;Plutarch's <span class="italic">Lives</span> and a Greek lexicon. Rhodes may not have had much success in growing cotton, but he left Natal exuberant at having discovered his ability to direct and control large numbers of African labourers with a shrewdly calculated self-interest. He had also acquired a set of perceptions about African labour and colonial expansion.<br>
<br>Rhodes's managerial skills were to prove important at the diggings for, within two weeks of his arrival, Herbert had departed for Natal and England, leaving Cecil in charge of his claims. That he was able to make his way in the anarchic and at times dangerous social world of Kimberley in the early 1870s is a remarkable tribute to his self-sufficiency and poise, even if Herbert had ensured his entry into the circle of well-connected claim-holders, administrators, and professional men at the diggings. Rhodes set about working his brother's claims and described the diggings in a series of vivid letters to his mother. Within a remarkably short time he had established his reputation in Kimberley. As his brother Frank, who accompanied Herbert back to Kimberley in 1872, wrote to his parents, &#145;Cecil seems to have done wonderfully well as regards the diamonds&#146;&#151;and he admitted that no one on the fields could believe that he, Frank, was the elder brother  (Marlowe, 57). Rhodes was indeed doing &#145;wonderfully well&#146;. Within two months he was discovering diamonds worth &pound;100 a week and within the year his personal fortune was valued at &pound;5000. By the summer of 1873 he had accumulated &pound;10,000&#151;enough to take him back to England to invest his earnings in land in Hampstead and an education in Oxford.<br>
<br>Despite these financial successes, an illness described as a &#145;slight heart attack&#146; left Rhodes with a sense of foreboding. On Herbert's return from Britain, the two set off for the Transvaal, partly so that Cecil could recuperate, partly to investigate a recently announced gold strike. Across the Vaal, Cecil purchased a 3000 acre tract of land while the ever-restless Herbert decided to relinquish his diamond claims in order to pursue fortune and adventure in central Africa. He was to die in 1879, when his hut caught fire in what is now Malawi.<br>
<br>The first of Rhodes's eight wills was signed in 1872; in it he left his possessions to the British secretary of state for the colonies, for the extension of the British empire. By the early 1870s the language of imperial expansion was in the air. &#145;The Anglo-Saxon race&#146;, thundered the <span class="italic">Natal Witness</span> in 1872, &#145;shall hold undisputed sway from Capetown to the Zambezi&#146;  (Newbury, &#145;Out of the pit&#146;, 27)&#151;and there were a number of Natal settlers intent on making this a reality, among them the renowned secretary for native affairs, Theophilus Shepstone, and his agent, Herbert's friend, Frederic Elton, both of whom had subcontinental ambitions. This was heady stuff for the young Rhodes, whose subsequent imperial vision probably owed more to the Natal and diggers' press than to John Ruskin's imperialist lectures which he is believed to have attended at Oxford  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On the diamond fields Rhodes soon established a small circle of slightly older male friends. By the end of 1872 he was working claims with Charles Dunnel Rudd, who was nine years his elder. Rudd came from a landowning family with experience in the engineering and machinery industry. An old Harrovian who left Trinity College, Cambridge, without a degree, Rudd was engaged in a variety of entrepreneurial activities in the 1870s and was in charge of Rhodes's claims. His natural caution balanced Rhodes's impetuosity.<br>
<br>Among Rhodes's other close friends at this period was John X. Merriman, described by Basil Williams as the &#145;best read man and the best talker in South Africa&#146;, and already a member of the Cape legislative assembly (he was later to become its last prime minister)  (Williams, 32). Merriman represented a long if ambiguous tradition of Cape constitutional liberalism which, with its belief in equality before the law and a colour-blind franchise, ran counter to the dominant social practices of the day; by the mid-1880s the tradition was increasingly under attack, not least from Rhodes himself. Close too was John Blades Currey, secretary to the recently arrived British administration in Griqualand West, whose family nursed Rhodes back to health during his first illness. Merriman and Currey introduced the young man to the world of Cape politics and administration.<br>
<br>Yet Rhodes still hoped to become a barrister and, in the summer of 1873, set off for Oxford. Disappointed to be refused entry to University College (perhaps because of his poor Latin prose), he was accepted by Oriel College, from which he matriculated on 13 October. However, by the end of his first term, during which he passed responsions, his mother's death in November and his own ill health forced him to leave Oxford. Early in 1874 he returned to Kimberley and set about establishing himself on the diamond fields in earnest.<h2>
<a name="Miningfordiamonds"></a>Mining for diamonds</h2>The Kimberley to which Rhodes now turned his attention was on the eve of its crucial transformation from the era of small claims and share-workers to the era of joint stock companies and, ultimately, monopoly. With the initial influx of individual diggers, a myriad of claims had been staked out on the four &#145;dry&#146; diggings that made up Kimberley. At that time each digger was limited to two claims. So long as the interests of small diggers predominated and mining was based on opencast quarrying requiring little capital outlay or technical expertise, black producers were able to compete with white, especially as they had the advantage of family labour. The success of these black diggers now formed a focus for the discontent of the many white small claim-holders, diggers, and share-workers, all of whom operated claims on behalf of owners in return for a percentage of the proceeds. Yet, in Kimberley, infinitely more dreams were shattered than fortunes made. By the time Rhodes returned from Oxford the mines were in a state of crisis. Drought in 1873 followed by floods early in 1874 had sent up food and transport costs in southern Africa, the world price of diamonds had plummeted as a result of a slump on the Austrian stock exchange, and the banks were beginning to foreclose on indebted small diggers. At the same time the mines were threatened with collapsing walls and flooding, the result of haphazard development and primitive technology. As Kimberley's initially opencast operations extended ever deeper underground, the mines demanded increasingly expensive machinery and more sophisticated techniques. When the eroded yellow ground close to the surface gave way to blue, many of the small diggers left the fields.<br>
<br>In the new colony of Griqualand West economic disaster was accompanied by political turmoil as small diggers took the law into their own hands and vented their frustration on what they deemed the unfair competition and illicit diamond selling of black diggers. This culminated in the formation of a white Kimberley Defence League and Protection Association and the so-called &#145;black flag&#146; revolt of April 1875. By the end of that year these events had led to the recall of Southey&#151;a supporter of the small claim-holders against the ambitions of larger metropolitan capital&#151;and his replacement as lieutenant-governor of Griqualand West. In 1876 all limitations on claim-holding were lifted, thus allowing for the formation of joint stock companies. There is little evidence that Rhodes took any part in this political and social unrest. From the first he had identified himself with the larger claim-holders and with the colonial administration. Moreover, he was well positioned to take advantage of the new situation. He recognized that, far from spelling the end of the industry, the blue deposits contained larger numbers of more valuable diamonds and that fortunes were to be made by those who could stay the course. On his return from Oxford in 1874 he and Rudd had concentrated their claims in the Vooruitzicht mines (later known as De Beers) and were able to take advantage of the departure of small diggers to consolidate their holdings, once the restrictions on claim-holdings were lifted. By the mid-1870s Rhodes and Rudd were among those advocating rationalization and amalgamation of the mines. By 1879 theirs was the largest concern in the De Beers mine.<br>
<br>Rhodes and Rudd were among the first to see the importance of pumping equipment and, by mid-1874, even before he had acquired a pump, Rhodes had contracted with the De Beers mining board to extract water from the mines. If this was sharp practice, Rhodes's subsequent dealings with the mining board and the pumping contract raised greater question marks over his business probity. In mid-1875 Rhodes's pumps broke down and a temporary contract was awarded to the engineer E. Huteau, pending the arrival of Rhodes's new machines. This arrangement proved satisfactory and the board contemplated transferring the permanent contract to Huteau. When, in December, the temporary pump was sabotaged, Huteau insinuated that Rhodes was responsible. Apparently in order to prevent further public discussion Rhodes forwarded the matter to the attorney-general, a close friend, and Huteau was charged with perjury. The case was never heard in court, however. By March 1876 Rhodes had left for Oxford where he spent most of the next two years. In October 1876 he confessed, &#145;My character was so battered at the Diamond Fields that I like to preserve the few remnants&#146;  (Turrell, <span class="italic">Capital and Labour</span>, 86).<h2>
<a name="ReturntoOxford"></a>Return to Oxford</h2>If Rhodes had already made his mark in Kimberley, his career at Oxford was undistinguished. When he returned, he read for a pass degree, not for honours; this permitted a pattern of broken residence. He was remembered by his tutor as being part of a set which lived &#145;a good deal apart from both games and work&#146;  (Michell, 1.81). Because of his peripatetic lifestyle, Rhodes completed his pass degree only in 1881, and although he was admitted at the Inner Temple in March 1876 he never seriously pursued a career in the law.<br>
<br>It is easier to see what Rhodes gave to Oxford than what he got from it. Notwithstanding many historical accounts, he was not in Oxford for John Ruskin's famous inaugural lecture, and there is little evidence that he read his works; nevertheless his Oxford years seem to have reinforced his dreams of expansion with that mix of racial pride and imperial enthusiasm which was beginning to permeate British intellectual and political circles. He seems to have been much impressed by the writings of Winwoode Reade, a social Darwinist who applied notions of the survival of the fittest to the &#145;races&#146; of mankind and believed that of all the races the &#145;Anglo-Saxon&#146; was manifestly the finest and fittest. Rhodes was also much taken by such classical authors as Aristotle and Marcus Aurelius as well as by Gibbon, all of whom extolled the virtues of public service.<br>
<br>These many influences came together in Rhodes's &#145;Confession of faith&#146;, a document which, however juvenile and ungrammatical, none the less expressed the philosophy that governed the rest of his life. The &#145;Confession&#146; was written on 2 June 1877, the day on which Rhodes was inducted as a life member of the Oxford University Apollo chapter of the freemasons  (Rotberg, 90). In it he mused on the history of the freemasons and the Jesuits, and advocated the formation of a secret society &#145;with but one object the furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the whole uncivilised world under British rule for the recovery of the United States for the making the Anglo-Saxon race but one Empire&#146;. For Rhodes, &#145;the absorption of the greater portion of the world under our rule&#146; would mean &#145;the end of all wars&#146;, for he believed that the British were &#145;the finest race in the world, and &hellip; the more of the world we inhabit, the better it is for the human race&#146;. &#145;What an alteration there would be,&#146; he continued, if &#145;those parts that are present inhabited by the most despicable of human beings &hellip; were brought under Anglo-Saxon influence&#146;  (Flint, appx, 248&#150;52).<br>
<br>In September 1877 these notions were embodied in Rhodes's second, vastly ambitious, will. In this he once more appointed as one of his executors the secretary of state for the colonies, who was at that time Lord Carnarvon, whose confederation schemes for southern Africa partly inspired Rhodes's own dream of a unified subcontinent. His endowment of Oxford scholarships, in order to inspire the young &eacute;lite of empire with ideas of imperial race pride and give effect to his ambitions of world domination, occurred somewhat later. Yet the will proposed the establishment of a secret society for the purposes set out in his &#145;Confession&#146;. Such proposals recurred in the six wills he wrote thereafter at regular intervals until his death. In 1891, when the journalist and publisher W. T. Stead&#151;appointed at that time one of his executors&#151;wrote asking him for his views on life and politics, Rhodes responded by sending him the &#145;Confession of faith&#146;. Not only was Rhodes obsessed by this grandiose project, it seems also to have fired the imagination of the coterie of devotees who surrounded him from his early years in Kimberley.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoKimberley"></a>Return to Kimberley</h2>There are doubtless many young men who dream of dominating and transforming the world. On his return from Oxford in 1878, the year in which his father died, Rhodes began to collect around him a select band with whom he could share this vision. His ability to recognize other people's talents and to draw them into his enterprises was among his most outstanding characteristics. Prominent among these were the mercurial <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34155/', "Leander Starr Jameson")</script>, who established himself in Kimberley as a general practitioner in 1878, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30676/', "Alfred Beit")</script>, financial genius and devoted follower  (Galbraith, 59) who helped build Rhodes's mining empire, and Neville Pickering, perhaps his most intimate companion and confidant.<br>
<br>Rhodes's possibly homosexual relationship with Pickering, the first of the young male secretaries with whom he established an intense friendship, has been the subject of much speculation. What is known is that Rhodes moved from his lodgings with the group of friends dubbed the Twelve Apostles, to share a cottage with Pickering, that in 1882 he left Pickering all his &#145;worldly wealth&#146;, and that in 1888, when Pickering lay dying, Rhodes abandoned an exploratory visit to the newly discovered Witwatersrand goldfields to nurse him. Through the 1890s Rhodes continued to befriend and employ unattached young men, whose admiration for him fell little short of adoration. He behaved with great possessiveness when any of them married, and he undoubtedly preferred the company of men to that of women.<br>
<br>There were three exceptions. The first, and probably most important, was the journalist Flora Shaw, who shared Rhodes's imperialist design and lent the support of her columns to his achieving a royal charter in central Africa. She was implicated in the Jameson raid, almost certainly acting as an intermediary between Rhodes and Chamberlain in their collusion, and in 1897 withheld important evidence of this collusion from the House of Commons select committee. There is no doubting Rhodes's admiration for her. He was also intrigued by&#151;and intrigued&#151;Olive Schreiner, who was later to write a damning indictment of his imperialism; and he showed an initial interest in Princess Radziwill, an impoverished Polish fortune-seeker who followed Rhodes to the Cape at the end of his life in the hope of attaching herself to him. When rebuffed, she attempted blackmail but, significantly, did not allege that Rhodes was homosexual.<h2>
<a name="TheriseofDeBeers"></a>The rise of De Beers</h2>With his already substantial holdings in Kimberley, in the decade after 1878 Rhodes set about accumulating the wealth and political power which were to enable him to shape the destiny of a subcontinent and influence the political culture of the metropole during his lifetime and beyond. In the three years from 1878 to 1880 he and Rudd consolidated their holdings in De Beers mine and in April 1880 were able to float the De Beers Mining Company with a share capital of &pound;200,000. In the following year, during a period of rapid joint stock company formation and &#145;share mania&#146;, they merged their claims with those of the neighbouring Frederic (later Sir Frederic Philipson) Stow and his partners to create the most highly capitalized mine on the fields at &pound;665,550.<br>
<br>During the depression of 1882&#150;5 the De Beers Mining Company became the premier concern on the fields, absorbing the weaker holdings in the old De Beers mine. By 1886 Stow had established a London office in order to secure metropolitan capital for their endeavours; in 1887 Rhodes, to the same end, brought Alfred Beit onto the De Beers board of directors. The election of Beit caused Stow considerable disquiet, largely because he feared a conflict of interest between the diamond producers in Kimberley and Beit's position as the leading diamond merchant on the fields. But in the battle for the amalgamation of the diamond fields and for the final monopolizing of the diamond mines Rhodes needed the access Beit provided to the markets of Europe. Although the creation of De Beers is usually attributed to Rhodes, the contributions of Stow and Beit were at least equally important  (Turrell, &#145;Sir Frederic Philipson Stow&#146;, 62&#150;7).<br>
<br>The story of the final contest for control of the diamond fields has frequently been told as a highly personalized encounter between Rhodes, the Oxford-educated Englishman, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1464/', "Barney Barnato")</script>, the slightly shady upstart from the Mile End Road, the most influential shareholder in Kimberley Central, De Beers's main rival. Recent research suggests that this mythology obscures a highly complex story of financial manoeuvring. Once he realized that Rhodes and Stow held the upper hand, through the assistance of the Rothschilds, Barnato joined forces with De Beers at the expense of his own shareholders, and to his own very considerable advantage. Together with Rhodes, Beit, and Stow&#151;and despite Stow's opposition&#151;Barnato was appointed a life governor of the new De Beers Consolidated Company, entitled to a quarter of all profits apart from the 30 per cent reserved for general shareholders. As a result of amalgamation, De Beers Consolidated became one of the largest British companies of the time  (Turrell, <span class="italic">Capital and Labour</span>, 206&#150;27).<br>
<br>The amalgamation of the mines notwithstanding, Rhodes never gained complete control either over the sale of stones or over the profits of De Beers. There were always tensions between diamond producers and diamond merchants, and between the boards of De Beers in Kimberley and London. There were also tensions between Rhodes and Barnato, which had never been over amalgamation <i>per se</i>, but over the immense geopolitical powers Rhodes wanted for the new company. In the end Rhodes's persistence won. The company's trust deed permitted it almost unparalleled power &#145;to acquire any asset of any kind by any means&#146;  (Rotberg, 209). It also permitted the acquisition of African territory by treaty or conquest, and the exercise of political authority over such territory.<br>
<br>So extensive were the company's powers that, when they were challenged in the courts by disgruntled Kimberley Central shareholders, the judge interrupted the litany to say that it would be far quicker to relate what the company could not do than what it could. Counsel for the plaintiffs responded by observing that De Beers &#145;could do anything and everything, my lord&#146;  (Rotberg, 209&#150;10). Despite the misgivings of Barnato and the other life governors, Beit and Stow, Rhodes was able to insist on the retention of these overarching powers. None the less, Rhodes had constraints placed upon his total freedom of action by the board and was not infrequently obliged to employ subterfuge in order to use the profits of De Beers for enterprises which his London board disliked.<br>
<br>Amalgamation had far-reaching consequences beyond the boardroom. It involved the loss of large numbers of jobs for white and black workers. It also saw the streamlining of methods of labour control which had already been pioneered at De Beers. Thus, even before the final stages of amalgamation were reached, Rhodes and his partners in De Beers had begun to reorganize the migrant labour system and establish &#145;closed compounds&#146; for black workers. These were modelled on the convict station Rhodes had earlier established at De Beers to make use of prison labour. Black workers were rigorously searched before and after being incarcerated in the compounds for the duration of their contracts. Attempts were also made similarly to strip-search and confine white workers, but these attempts failed. The nexus of laws and institutions for the control of African labour established at De Beers provided the model for twentieth-century South Africa.<br>
<br>This control of African labour was made possible both by the imperial conquest and annexation of the remaining independent African kingdoms of southern Africa between 1878 and 1885, and by the increasing role played by Rhodes and his fellow Griqualand West representatives in the politics of Cape Colony. In 1880 Griqualand West was finally incorporated into the colony and Rhodes was elected as member of parliament for Barkly West, amid widespread allegations of vote buying. He rapidly became the most prominent spokesman for the diamond interest, not least because he had secretly bought the colony's leading newspaper, the <span class="italic">Cape Argus</span>. Rhodes and the Griqualand West representatives had four major concerns in the legislative assembly: to increase their own control over labour migration routes, to improve their disciplinary powers over labour, most essentially through the compound system, to prevent the haemorrhage of diamonds through illicit smuggling, and to secure a railway from the coast to Kimberley.<h2>
<a name="Politics"></a>Politics</h2>Rhodes's purpose in being in parliament became immediately evident in his chairmanship of a select committee to inquire into illicit diamond buying, a select committee which framed the <span class="roman">Diamond Trade Act</span> of 1882. This draconian piece of legislation, aimed at curbing illicit diamond buying and selling, put the onus on the accused to prove their innocence, allowed for entrapment, and permitted police searches without warrant. Rhodes also demanded flogging for anyone handling stolen diamonds, but this was rejected by the legislative assembly.<br>
<br>Rhodes exercised his influence without being a frequent speaker in parliamentary debates. His maiden speech concerned the affairs of Basutoland, at that time engaged in a costly war with Cape Colony, which had taken over the territory from the British government in 1872. His opposition to the disarmament of the Basuto, as proposed by the legislature, has often been read as showing his early sympathy with African peoples and their rights. However, here too diamond interests were not far from the surface. The war not only obstructed the construction of the Kimberley railway: Basuto migrants were attracted to Kimberley by the prospect of acquiring firearms. Mine owners feared that disarmament would drastically cut the supply of a particularly reliable source of labour. As one Kimberley man said: &#145;After all, we sold them the guns; they bought them with their hard-won wages, and it <i>is</i> hard lines to make them give them up again&#146;  (Williams, 63). In addition, Basutoland served as &#145;the granary&#146; of the diamond fields and was an important source of firewood. It was crucial to the mine magnates that the war be ended as soon as possible. Rhodes advocated the passage of a <span class="roman">Disannexation Bill</span> and the retrocession of Basutoland to the imperial government, a policy that was eventually followed in 1884.<br>
<br>In Basutoland, as a member of a commission to investigate the claims for compensation of &#145;loyal&#146; Basuto, Rhodes met General Charles George Gordon, then engaged by the Cape government to reorganize the colonial troops who were unsuccessfully contending with the Basuto. Like Rhodes, Gordon came to believe that Cape policy was misconceived, and resigned. The two men are said to have made a profound impression on one another. Gordon invited Rhodes to join him on his ill-fated expedition to the Sudan, and Rhodes was much affected by news of Gordon's death in 1885 at the hands of the Mahdists.<br>
<br>Diamond interests undoubtedly contributed to the regional perspective Rhodes had already set out so grandiosely in his 1877 &#145;Confession&#146;. In his speech on the <span class="roman">Disannexation Bill</span> he looked forward to a &#145;United States of Africa&#146; under the British flag, although, after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of Lord Carnarvon's confederation schemes for South Africa in the 1870s, he believed Cape Colony should take the lead. By the early 1880s Rhodes was turning his attention to the increasingly anarchic conditions in Bechuanaland on the western flank of Griqualand West. The new market at Kimberley had intensified the struggle between the local Tswana people and Afrikaners for the region's limited arable land and water resources. This conflict was exacerbated when the British withdrew from the Transvaal (which had been annexed in 1877 and then surrendered after the British defeat at Majuba in 1881) and warring Tswana chiefs invited in Transvaal and Cape mercenaries to assist in their internecine battles.<br>
<br>From 1878 Tswana chiefs and their missionary allies appealed for British protection but were ignored. Despite the interest of Cape merchants in the road to the north which ran through Bechuanaland, the colonial legislature was equally reluctant to take any action that would necessitate expenditure. Early in 1882, at the invitation of the contending local chiefs, Afrikaner mercenaries established the little republics of Stellaland and Goshen to the north of Griqualand West, straddling the missionary route to the interior. These freebooters were backed by land speculators in the South African Republic and supported by its recently restored government, which saw the possibilities for using the conflict to test the resolve of the British government and gain additional land.<br>
<br>Rhodes urged action. All his interests were at stake. As in Basutoland, Bechuanaland represented a source of labour and firewood for Kimberley, and the new republics threatened the supply routes to the west of the Transvaal. Moreover, since he and his fellow diamond merchants were anxious to control any new source of diamonds, it was in Rhodes's interest to argue for the annexation of the territory. This was an objective to which the eastern Cape merchants lent support, since for them the presence in the territory of freebooter Afrikaners threatened to undermine their commercial prospects in the interior. While most of Rhodes's biographers have perceived this episode as indicative of Rhodes's imperial vision, his actions in this case had more to do with immediate and material local imperatives.<br>
<br>By 1883 Rhodes had been dispatched to the region as the Cape's trouble-shooter. The most powerful local chief, Mankurwane, agreed to place his territory under Cape rule, and the Stellalanders were induced to accept Cape incorporation, although the settlers at Goshen proved more intractable. Urged by Rhodes, the British government, after some hesitation, was persuaded by the British high commissioner and Cape governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, to secure the trade route and pacify the region. The resulting London convention of 1884 gave the South African Republic more territory, but left open the vital corridor to the north. John Mackenzie, a missionary, was appointed deputy commissioner, but failed to restore order and was replaced by Rhodes. Initially Rhodes was no more successful in resolving the rival territorial claims, and was forced to withdraw from Goshen in August 1884 when a republican commando invaded the territory and the Transvaal president, S. J. P. Kruger, proclaimed its sovereignty.<br>
<br>By this time, however, the colonial situation had been transformed by the fall of the inert Scanlen ministry and its replacement by one which shared Rhodes's expansionist ideas. Moreover, the geopolitical situation had also been altered by the intervention of Germany in the region: at the end of April 1884 Bismarck had declared a protectorate over the German trading post at Angra Peque&ntilde;a, and by the end of August had annexed the whole of what became South-West Africa from the Orange River to the as yet unspecified borders of the Portuguese colony of Angola. Despite the efforts of the new Cape ministry, prompted by Rhodes and Merriman, to secure colonial interests in an area long regarded as its commercial hinterland, Germany had acquired its first colony in Africa. Its presence along the Atlantic coast led to fears that the German colony and the South African Republic would act jointly to block the road to the north.<br>
<br>Bechuanaland was now seen as a key imperial interest, and any attempt by the Transvaal to annex the republic of Goshen became unthinkable. At the end of 1884 the imperial government re-entered the region, forced Kruger to withdraw, and sent a military expedition to Bechuanaland under Major-General Sir Charles Warren. He was accompanied by Rhodes and Mackenzie. The triumvirate was doomed to disagreement from the start, divided as they were on matters of principle. Warren and Mackenzie were determined to defend the land and political rights of local African chiefs; Rhodes was equally determined to reconcile the Stellalanders to British rule and secure the region for white settlement. In February 1885, when Warren repudiated the land titles he had granted the Stellaland settlers, Rhodes resigned.<br>
<br>Despite his resignation, Rhodes nevertheless gained much of what he wanted. Warren re-established order, placed southern Bechuanaland under crown rule, and proclaimed northern Bechuanaland a British protectorate. Transvaal expansion was blocked; the road northwards remained open; and the movement of labour was unimpeded. Moreover Rhodes had been able to prevent Warren's attempt to limit land claims in the new colony to persons of British descent and so had furthered his nascent alliance with the Cape Afrikaners.<h2>
<a name="Rhodesin1885"></a>Rhodes in 1885</h2>In many ways 1885 was a watershed year for Rhodes, now one of the wealthiest men in South Africa and still only thirty-two years old. The first phase of the amalgamation of the diamond fields and the creation of the De Beers Company had been completed. His Oxford dreams accomplished, he had increasingly identified himself with the subcontinent. In 1883 he had served very briefly as treasurer-general in the Scanlen ministry and had emerged as a leading Cape politician. Majuba and the British withdrawal from the Transvaal, together with imperial indecisiveness over Bechuanaland, had convinced him that for further expansion he needed a local power base, and the increasing hold of the recently formed Afrikaner Bond as the political party of Cape Afrikaners made it clear that this would depend on an alliance with them. The Bechuanaland experience was an object lesson in the importance of local sub-imperialism.<h2>
<a name="GoldandtheRand"></a>Gold and the Rand</h2>The discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in the South African Republic in 1886 opened a new phase in the history of the subcontinent&#151;and in Rhodes's life. In the next decade the remaining independent African polities south of the Limpopo were conquered and annexed, and both within and without the frontiers of the colonial states, land, labour, and mineral concessionaires were spurred by prospects of further discoveries and the availability of speculative capital. The Limpopo River constituted no barrier to the flood of fortune-seekers, and between 1889 and 1895 all of the African territories as far north as the Congo were annexed in &#145;a gigantic speculation in mineral futures&#146;  (Robinson, Gallagher, and Denny, 250). In central Africa the British competed with the South African Republic, Portugal, Germany, and Belgium. In east-central Africa, to the west and south of Lake Nyasa, the thrust from the south encountered an anti-slavery, missionary, and trading frontier from the east. In this last phase of the scramble for southern African territories, Rhodes played a leading role.<br>
<br>Paradoxically, however, Rhodes was at first somewhat dismissive of the stories of untold wealth on the Rand; he had burnt his fingers on the short-lived Barberton goldfields a couple of years before, and De Beers's American mining engineer in Kimberley was sceptical of the claims being made for the Witwatersrand. During Rhodes's absence prospecting in the Transvaal, Pickering had fallen ill and Rhodes had returned to Kimberley to nurse his dying friend. Always less assured in his appreciation of the goldfields, Rhodes's early investments were haphazard and injudicious. Although he and his partners launched Gold Fields Company Ltd early in 1887 with a share capital of &pound;250,000, initially at least they made more money by manipulating the share market than through the value of their investments. By 1888 it was clear that on the Rand Rhodes had &#145;cornered the dregs&#146;  (Rotberg, 499) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95075', "Randlords")</script>].<h2>
<a name="TheBritishSouthAfricaCompany"></a>The British South Africa Company</h2>Failure on the Rand was an additional spur for Rhodes to move north of the Limpopo, where he believed he would find a &#145;second Rand&#146;, pre-empt rival explorations for diamonds, and outflank an increasingly confident South African Republic. From the 1860s it had been known that there were &#145;ancient gold workings&#146; between the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers, and by the mid-1880s <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52662/', "Lobengula")</script>, king of the most powerful people in that region, the Ndebele (Matabele), was surrounded by concession hunters, including Rhodes's agents. When, at the end of 1887, news came of possible Transvaal expansion across the Limpopo, Rhodes put pressure on Sir Hercules Robinson to act. At Rhodes's insistence, Robinson now authorized J. S. Moffat, son of the famous missionary Robert Moffat, to secure a treaty of amity between Lobengula and the British government, which in effect declared ultimate imperial sovereignty over the Ndebele kingdom (February 1888).<br>
<br>This gave Rhodes his opportunity in Matabeleland, and he set about converting concession into control. In 1888 Rudd, T. Rochefort Maguire (a friend of his Oxford days), and F. R. Thompson, who had established the closed compounds at De Beers, were sent to secure exclusive mining rights in Lobengula's kingdom. Through a mixture of bribery and guile, on 30 October 1888 they secured the king's signature to the Rudd concession permitting the exploitation of minerals in his domains in which were included the lands of his reluctant Shona tributaries. Although the king soon regretted his concession, it strengthened Rhodes immeasurably against his rival concessionaires whom he was now able to buy out.<br>
<br>On 29 October 1889 the British government granted the British South Africa Company (BSAC) a royal charter to exploit and extend its administrative control over a vast, if ill-defined, area of southern and central Africa. Nowhere was Rhodes's conviction that everyone had his price better illustrated than in his dealings to gain and protect the chartered company. An amalgamation of London financial interests and potential competitors, bedecked by an array of aristocratic directors, including the dukes of Abercorn and Fife, the BSAC not only represented a somewhat dubious business enterprise, it also consistently misled the investing public with inspired but false accounts of its new Eldorado. Potential competitors and critics in Britain and the Cape were bought out with substantial shareholdings. Contrary to the impression given at the time, the concession did not include land rights, which the BSAC bought from Edouard Lippert in 1891. Nor, contrary to what the British government and investing public had been misled into assuming, did the company actually own the Rudd concession. This too had to be acquired by BSAC shareholders for &pound;1 million from the United Concessions Company (formerly the Central Search Company, and in which Gold Fields had a controlling interest), to the great personal profit of Rhodes and his partners.<br>
<br>For the British government the BSAC's great advantage was its promise to people central Africa with white immigrants who would make British occupation effective against contending European powers and bring the necessary capitalist development to the interior at minimum cost. In 1890 a &#145;pioneer column&#146;, consisting of 200 white settlers and 150 black, backed by 500 paramilitary police, occupied Mashonaland, without incident. The &#145;pioneers&#146; soon scattered over the country in search of gold.<br>
<br>Even before his charter was ratified, Rhodes had sent his agents across the Zambezi, where the British government was anxious to pre-empt its European rivals. Among these agents was the British consul in Mozambique, Harry (later Sir Harry) Johnson, from whom Rhodes probably acquired his slogan of a &#145;Cape to Cairo&#146; railway and the idea of a telegraph link. In 1888&#150;9, in a flurry of treaty-making, the whole of present-day Malawi and Zambia was staked out for crown and company. The object was to reach the copper deposits of Katanga, but Rhodes's representatives were foiled by the emissaries of the Belgian king, Leopold II, ruler of the Congo Free State. Despite the dubious legality of the treaties, they secured mineral and sometimes land concessions for the BSAC, while the chiefs agreed to accept British jurisdiction over non-Africans in their domains and over external relations. In the European chancelleries, where the frontiers of Africa were then being decided, these treaties provided the British government with useful bargaining counters and helped to establish over the following decade the frontiers of the states which were afterwards to become Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.<br>
<br>Since events, in South Africa itself and in what was to become Rhodesia, absorbed most of Rhodes's energies and financial capacity, the fact that south-central Africa was now entirely under alien rule meant little north of the Zambezi until the late 1890s. Nor was Rhodes able to gain all the territory he wanted. In 1890&#150;91 the British and Portuguese governments delimited the frontiers of their African territories. Despite the machinations of Rhodes and Jameson, who took command of the new colony of Mashonaland at the end of 1890, and a considerable display of force by company agents, most of Barotseland, Gazaland, and Manicaland remained in Portuguese hands. For the Foreign Office, European diplomacy took precedence over African expansion. Nevertheless, the final Anglo-Portuguese treaty in 1891 left the healthy highlands in the hands of the company and guaranteed freedom of passage between Mashonaland and the sea. Without a railway, however, the pioneers had little future.<br>
<br>In Mashonaland the settlers were also disappointed in their hopes of instant wealth. It was soon clear that any &#145;second Rand&#146; north of the Limpopo must lie in Matabeleland. Making use of an Ndebele raid on their Shona tributaries around Fort Victoria, Jameson deliberately provoked war against the Ndebele in 1893, and using Maxim machine-guns defeated them. This resulted in the destruction of the Ndebele kingdom, BSAC occupation of Matabeleland, and white settlement there. The war was followed, as Jameson anticipated, by a boom in BSAC shares and huge mining speculation. Nevertheless, by the end of 1894 it was evident to Rhodes's mining engineers that the unviable outcrop mines in Matabeleland could not compete with the deep-level gold of the Witwatersrand. Rhodes's policies towards the South African Republic hardened perceptibly.<h2>
<a name="PrimeministerofCapeColony"></a>Prime minister of Cape Colony</h2>Up to this point Rhodes's expansionist schemes were enthusiastically supported within Cape Colony. He had been careful to court the leadership of the Afrikaner Bond through the judicious distribution of BSAC shares, while the rank and file were enticed with promises of cheap land and labour in his new colony. But Bond support for Rhodes had been long in the making and went well beyond mere bribery. On 17 July 1890 he became prime minister of the Cape with the backing of both the Afrikaner Bond and the liberal members of the legislative assembly. On the face of it, both sources of support were surprising and full of contradiction. The Cape liberals differed fundamentally with Rhodes over the place of Africans in Cape society, and had more fastidious standards of public life. Despite their misgivings, however, the three most prominent liberal parliamentarians agreed to join Rhodes's 1890 ministry in order to get rid of the financially irresponsible Sprigg government. In 1892 they were also persuaded to accept the <span class="roman">Franchise and Ballot Act</span>. This was passed at the behest of the Bond and raised the property qualifications for voters, but also introduced an elementary literacy test and a secret ballot which they advocated. Nevertheless, they were increasingly disaffected, and when in 1893 Rhodes failed to expel from his cabinet a minister whom they accused of corruption, the liberals, having on 22 June 1893 formally questioned the propriety of his holding the dual position of premier of the Cape and head of the British South Africa Company, resigned. In spite of this, Rhodes easily won the 1894 general election and he re-formed his cabinet with increased Bond representation.<br>
<br>For Rhodes, the alliance with the Bond, which controlled just under half the seats in parliament, was far more important than his association with the liberals, and he had nurtured it since the mid-1880s. His concern to improve colonial agriculture through replacing Cape vines destroyed by phylloxera, encouraging fruit farms, and stamping out scab disease in sheep had endeared him to the more commercially-minded Afrikaner farmers even before he became premier. His interest in controlling African labour was also shared by this wider constituency. In 1886&#150;7 he had given earlier Bond proposals to change the Cape franchise his whole-hearted support, while in 1890, in the hope of gaining Bond favour, he supported a <span class="roman">Masters and Servants Amendment Bill</span> which permitted the flogging of black servants. In the event the bill was defeated, with even some Bondsmen voting against it. In his second ministry Rhodes took on the portfolio of native affairs in addition to the premiership. In 1894 he annexed Pondoland, the remaining independent African territory between the Cape and Natal, where civil strife and the rival claims of Natal provided the pretext for intervention.<br>
<br>More wide-ranging was Rhodes's <span class="roman">Glen Grey Act</span> of 1895. This allowed Africans to acquire land under individual tenure on strictly controlled terms, provided for local councils, and imposed a labour tax intended to propel Africans into working for white employers. Widely hailed as &#145;a bill for Africa&#146;, the act was an astute way of satisfying Rhodes's disparate constituencies. Individual tenure and local self-government were long-held liberal demands, while the labour tax and the exclusion of <span class="roman">Glen Grey</span> property-holders from the parliamentary franchise were much to the liking of the Bond&#151;even if, in the event, the labour tax soon fell into disuse. The control over the liquor trade, also embodied in the act, appealed to all but western Cape wine farmers.<br>
<br>If Rhodes was mindful of Bond predilections in framing his &#145;native policy&#146;, initially he was also careful to avoid antagonizing their pro-Transvaal sensibilities. This was made easier for him as by the late 1880s the competing interests of Cape and Transvaal farmers, expressed in conflicting tariff policies, had made Bondsmen veer away from uncritical support for the northern republic. Moreover, after the Bechuanaland d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, Rhodes came to advocate a Cape sub-imperialism in which Bond Afrikaners were equal partners. His visions for a united South Africa gave the leading role to colonial forces, and had much in common with those of Jan Hofmeyr, the leading Bondsman. Until the mid-1890s he was also prepared to allow the Transvaal to fulfil some of its territorial ambitions in the annexation of Swaziland, and he envisaged the peaceful achievement of South African unification through gradual economic integration.<br>
<br>Rhodes's success in 1892 in constructing a railway between the Cape and the Transvaal was also popular with Bondsmen, who hoped to sell their agricultural products on the burgeoning Rand market. Yet this policy brought him into direct confrontation with Kruger, who was anxious to retain the republic's autonomy and protect its farmers by building a railway to Delagoa Bay and by raising tariffs on Cape produce. In 1894&#150;5 this blew up into a major crisis when, with the imminent completion of its railway to Delagoa Bay, the republic raised tariffs on the Transvaal section of the Cape line. In response, the colonists transported their goods across the Vaal River by ox-wagon. When Kruger closed the fords over the river in an endeavour to exclude Cape produce, war between the two states seemed imminent. It was only averted when Kruger backed down in the face of an imperial ultimatum in November 1895. Through all this Rhodes continued to enjoy the support of Cape Afrikaners.<h2>
<a name="Nationalismandempire"></a>Nationalism and empire</h2>From being in his youth a &#145;rabid jingo&#146;, Rhodes was now a leading exponent of an autonomous South African nationalism, albeit within the British empire. And this form of nationalism was shared by Cape Afrikaners. To this end he began to foster a local South African identity, by extending his patronage to the preservation of Cape Dutch architecture and furniture, cultivating a sense of colonial history and heritage. The statue of Van Riebeeck, the founder of the Dutch settlement at the Cape, which now stands at the foot of Cape Town's main thoroughfare, was paid for by Rhodes. Groote Schuur, his house on the slopes of Table Mountain, which he left in his will as the residence of a future South Africa's prime ministers, was restored in the local idiom at Rhodes's expense by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30547/', "Herbert Baker")</script>, then a young architect, later the architect of Rhodes House in Oxford. Amid the Matabele uprising Rhodes found time to extol the virtues of the colonial historian George McCauley Theal.<br>
<br>So identified was Rhodes with the Cape colonists that in the late 1880s his pro-imperial credentials were in doubt, and he was widely referred to as the &#145;young Burger&#146;. This was to oversimplify his position: Rhodes's overarching ambition remained imperial expansion and consolidation, as his many wills and his continued support for imperial federation reveal. In 1888, for example, he gave &pound;10,000 to Parnell to support Irish home rule, provided the Irish members of parliament remained at Westminster in the event of home rule. This donation had the added benefit of encouraging, if not ensuring, the support of the Irish parliamentarians for Rhodes's as yet vague schemes of northward expansion. In 1891 he made a secret donation of &pound;5000 to the Liberal Party in the hope of its also supporting his expansionism, and because he had begun to see it as a bulwark against the rise of socialism in Britain  (Michell, 2.48). He sat between Gladstone and John Morley at dinner, Gladstone finding him &#145;A notable man&#146; and Morley observing, &#145;The African has a fine head; a Gold full eye, and a strong chin&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 19 Feb 1891). By that time Rhodes was being lionized by liberals in London, while early in 1892 the University of Oxford had decided to grant him an honorary degree.<h2>
<a name="TheJamesonraid"></a>The Jameson raid</h2>Rhodes's respectability in Britain reached its zenith when on 2 February 1895 he was sworn of the privy council on the nomination of Lord Rosebery. By 1899, however, when Rhodes finally came to have the Oxford degree conferred, it had become a matter of some contention. By then his reputation had been tarnished by his identification with the Jameson raid and an increasingly jingoistic pro-war faction in South Africa. It was for these reasons that, although he was elected a member of London's Athenaeum in 1895, he was blackballed by the Travellers' Club. In the 1890s the increasing economic power of the South African Republic had begun to transform the political geography of South Africa. At the same time, by the mid-1890s Rhodes found his hopes of gold in Matabeleland disappointed, and the development of Rhodesia and his deep-level mines on the Witwatersrand were a heavy drain on his capital. The South African Republic's inability to create the conditions necessary for recruiting a docile and coerced labour force, along with its liquor, railway, and dynamite policies, were all irksome to deep-level mine owners like Rhodes with their huge demand for labour, their tight working costs, and their great need for explosives.<br>
<br>Making use of the largely fomented clamour of unfranchised British immigrants known as Uitlanders (&#145;aliens&#146;, that is non-Boers), over their lack of voting rights and other grievances, Rhodes began to plot with leading members of the mining community for the armed overthrow of the republic. He was secretly backed by Joseph Chamberlain, the British colonial secretary, who was anxious to retain control over the political outcome, and by the compromised Sir Hercules Robinson, whose re-selection as British high commissioner at the Cape Rhodes had secured for a second time in 1895.<br>
<br>At the end of 1895 Jameson on his own initiative invaded the Transvaal with some 600 BSAC armed police and volunteers, hoping to be assisted by the planned uprising of Uitlanders in Johannesburg mobilized by Rhodes's brother Frank and members of the Reform Committee. Aware of the lack of support in Johannesburg, Rhodes attempted to postpone the invasion, but was unable to stop Jameson, whose confidence had been greatly enhanced by his success in Matabeleland. Ill-conceived and poorly organized, the Jameson raid, as it became known, was a complete fiasco. There was no Uitlander uprising and the raiders were soon arrested. The leading members of the Reform Committee were sentenced to death, although their sentences were soon commuted to life imprisonment. They were released when Rhodes paid &pound;25,000 per head to the Transvaal treasury.<br>
<br>More significantly Rhodes's unwillingness to repudiate Jameson forced his resignation in January 1896 from the premiership of Cape Colony. The alliance Rhodes had carefully constructed between English-speakers and Afrikaners was finally destroyed when a Cape parliamentary select committee of inquiry showed his collusion in the raid. Previously loyal to the empire, most Cape Afrikaners, now feeling deeply betrayed, began to draw closer to the republic against the British, as did the Afrikaners of the Orange Free State. The Cape electorate was increasingly polarized on ethnic lines.<br>
<br>The raid also threatened Rhodes's charter. Within weeks he was in London negotiating with Chamberlain. Unable to prevent a House of Commons inquiry into the raid or the call for Rhodes's resignation as managing director of the BSAC, the colonial secretary nevertheless agreed to defend the charter in exchange for Rhodes's silence over the &#145;missing telegrams&#146; which revealed his own complicity in the attempted coup. Rhodes treated the select committee, by which he was questioned, with swaggering contempt. However, its long duration&#151;it reported only in July 1897&#151;and the changed political situation in South Africa also defused the attack on Rhodes, as did his role in settling the Ndebele uprising in Southern Rhodesia in 1896. He was not stripped of his privy councillorship, as many had expected.<h2>
<a name="TherisinginSouthernRhodesia1896"></a>The rising in Southern Rhodesia, 1896</h2>In Southern Rhodesia the absence of the British South Africa police, as a result of the Jameson raid, precipitated an uprising by the Ndebele in March 1896. On top of their defeat in 1893, they had been goaded beyond endurance by the rapaciousness of the settlers, who looted their cattle, ravished their women, and stole their land, and who were uncontrolled by the ramshackle government Rhodes had established. The outbreak of the catastrophic cattle disease rinderpest proved the last straw. Rhodes arrived in Salisbury just as the crisis broke, and rapidly took charge, joining in the relief of Bulawayo. For a time the small white colony seemed doomed.<br>
<br>By June, to the amazement of the settlers, who regarded them as abject &#145;slaves&#146; of the Ndebele, many of the Shona people rose as well. British military assistance became essential to crushing the uprising, although Rhodes was determined to prevent any imperial annexation of a colony he regarded as his own. After the battle of Taba zi ka Mambo on 5 July, he realized that the only hope of saving his charter lay with initiating peace overtures with the Ndebele, which he did secretly, and in the face of virulent settler and military opposition. For many contemporaries, as well as for subsequent historians, Rhodes's physical and moral courage in entering negotiations with the Ndebele in the Matopos made this his finest moment.<br>
<br>By mid-October the Ndebele, exhausted by war, rinderpest, and famine, had accepted his terms, which included a recognition of African communal tenure and his personal purchase of considerable land between Bulawayo and the Matopos on which they could be resettled. Now Rhodes had to &#145;square&#146; his own side, many of whom were furious at the settlement: by the end of 1897 he had spent more than &pound;10,000 in an attempt to pacify the colonists, and had accepted the idea of settler representation in a proposed legislative council. He also had to end the uprising among the intransigent Shona, which spluttered on for another year. Although this never threatened white settlement in the same way, the continued resistance of the Shona held up white settlement in Rhodesia's eastern province until 1898.<br>
<br>Peace with the Ndebele saved the charter, even if amid the uprisings Rhodes had to resign as managing director of the BSAC. At the same time, the chimurenga, as the uprisings were called by Africans, led for the first time to direct British government intervention in BSAC affairs, with the appointment of a British resident commissioner in Bulawayo responsible to the imperial high commissioner in Cape Town, and the establishment of a legislative council in October 1898. &#145;Native administration&#146; was put on a more systematic footing and stripped of its more immediately coercive aspects. The age of adventurism was over; the era of settler domination was about to begin.<h2>
<a name="Capepolitics18961898"></a>Cape politics, 1896&#150;1898</h2>By 1898 Rhodes had recovered his position to a remarkable extent. Not only had he rejoined the board of the chartered company but, contrary to those historians who believe he was a spent force after the Jameson raid, he had also regained a surprising degree of political influence at the Cape, although the political context was changed. In 1896 the Loyal Colonial League had been founded in the Cape, to promote British supremacy in South Africa, and spread as the South African League in the Transvaal and Natal under Rhodes's presidency and patronage. The league engaged in an unscrupulous propaganda campaign against the supposed brutality of the Kruger government directed at the Uitlanders in the Transvaal. In this they were aided by the newspapers, which were largely controlled by Rhodes and his fellow mine magnates. Picked up and reproduced in the British press, these reports contributed powerfully to the creation of pro-war public opinion in the metropole. In South Africa the arrival in 1897 of the ardent imperialist Sir Alfred Milner as the British high commissioner magnified their influence.<br>
<br>In addition, Rhodes became the informal leader of a new grouping of Progressives in the Cape parliament, and spearheaded their efforts in the closely fought general election of 1898, by contributing to party funds and morale. It was in this campaign that he also acquired the reputation for being a liberal supporter of the Cape franchise but this erroneous impression arose out of a typical example of Rhodes's opportunism. In 1897, before the campaign began, he had, with an eye on the Uitlanders in the Transvaal, announced that he favoured &#145;equal rights for all white men&#146;. This brought an outcry from coloured and African voters but Rhodes took over a year to respond to them and only when it appeared that he might lose their support in the forthcoming election did he reformulate his slogan as &#145;equal rights for all civilized men south of the Zambezi&#146; (<span class="italic">Diamond Fields Advertiser</span>, 23 July 1898; <span class="italic">Cape Times</span>, 10 Aug 1898). Moreover the exigencies of the Cape's non-racial franchise led him to fund the African newspaper <span class="italic">Izwi la Bantu</span>, which provided an alternative voice to the pro-Bond <span class="italic">Imvo Zabantusundu</span>.<br>
<br>For all Rhodes's efforts, the Bond-supported W. P. Schreiner became premier in 1898, and this left little scope for Rhodes in Cape politics. Over the next year he travelled restlessly, to Oxford to receive his honorary degree, to Europe, where he met the Kaiser, to inspect Southern Rhodesia, and back to the Cape. He also helped to extend the railway from Vryburg to Bulawayo (4 November 1897), began to arrange for its extension as far as Cairo, and, on 21 April 1898, was re-elected director of the BSAC.<h2>
<a name="Rhodessfinalwill"></a>Rhodes's final will</h2>It was at this time that Rhodes wrote his eighth and final will; he signed it on 1 July 1899. Increasingly suffering from his heart, he sensed mortality and was concerned to leave a &#145;monument to posterity&#146;. His sixth and seventh wills, in 1892 and 1893, had begun to focus on the need to inculcate the value of empire in young colonials. This was fully formulated in his last will. Rhodes's estate, when finally settled in 1907, left, after family benefactions, &pound;3,340,000 for the Rhodes Trust (whose assets by 1995&#150;6 were valued at &pound;145,638,000). The will provided for fifty-two scholarships each year to Oxford for young men (women were explicitly excluded) from Canada, Australia, South Africa, Rhodesia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, Bermuda, Jamaica, and the United States (which he still hoped would be restored to the British empire), but not for India. In a codicil to the will in 1901 six scholarships were also set aside for Germans, partly because of Rhodes's liking for the Kaiser, and also because of a vague notion of Teutonic race unity. The young men were to be chosen for their scholarly achievements, athletic abilities, and leadership qualities. Oriel College was to receive &pound;100,000, and land in Rhodesia was left to provide for a university there.<br>
<br>Behind the provisions lurked Rhodes's old ambition of creating a &#145;band of brothers&#146; who would strengthen the ties of empire. He also left money for more explicitly political purposes: the creation of a pro-imperial political party or interest groups within the existing parties. This fund was to be used in the twentieth century to support a variety of imperial causes, including the closer union movement in South Africa, the pro-imperial Round Table, chairs in imperial history in Oxford and London, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House. The first trustees included his close associates Beit, Jameson, and Earl Grey, as well as the Liberal Lord Rosebery and Milner.<h2>
<a name="TheSouthAfricanWarandRhodessdeath"></a>The South African War, and Rhodes's death</h2>The outbreak of the South African War in October 1899 found Rhodes in Kimberley, and he remained there for the four months of the siege (14 October 1899 to 15 February 1900), to ensure its rapid lifting and perhaps hoping by his presence to raise morale. During the siege he quarrelled with, threatened, and once tried to punch the military commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Kekewich. On Rhodes's return to Cape Town he was to find, to his annoyance, that Princess Radziwill, who had followed him to the Cape in 1899, was intriguing to have him restored as premier. He spent considerable time over the next two years fending off her unwelcome attentions. Ultimately, the desperate princess attempted to blackmail him with correspondence she claimed to have in her possession, showing Chamberlain's complicity in the Jameson raid. When she forged Rhodes's signature on promissory notes Rhodes instituted criminal proceedings against her. The final proceedings were heard at Groote Schuur during his last illness, and the verdict&#151;which found her guilty and sentenced her to two years' imprisonment&#151;was rendered after his death.<br>
<br>Rhodes's sojourns in Cape Town in the two years before his death were brief. The war meant that he was no longer at the centre of affairs, and his health was deteriorating. During 1900 he travelled to London to defend himself against the attacks of his former associate W. T. Stead over the raid, and undertook a five-month journey through Rhodesia in an effort both to restore his health and systematically to survey the progress of &#145;his&#146; colony. The summer of 1901 was spent in Britain and Europe before he returned once more to confront the princess. He died on 26 March 1902 in his cottage in Muizenberg, just outside Cape Town, surrounded by some of his closest associates, and a younger brother. At his own request, he was buried amid the grandeur of the Matopos in Southern Rhodesia on 10 April.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Cecil John Rhodes has always been the subject of intense controversy. Even in his lifetime he was revered by his intimates, who regarded him as a towering colossus, and reviled by those who saw him as an unprincipled and unscrupulous adventurer. In an age of expanding empire and speculative mining capital, Rhodes was able to give effect to a vast ambition to acquire wealth and power, and to justify this ambition in terms of a vision of Anglo-Saxon world domination. For many of his early biographers, though not all of his countrymen, his life expressed the patriotic aspirations of an imperial age. Later biographers and historians who have not shared his imperialism have been more critical of his methods. They have shown how, for most of the peoples of southern Africa, his ventures hastened the pace of colonialism, capitalist development, and political reconstruction and were accompanied by brutal conquest, ruthless exploitation, sharp business practice, and the insidious corruption of public life. Nevertheless, in his lifetime Rhodes's use of power was often tempered by his ability to engage imaginatively with those who were subject to his control and to bestow largess upon them, whether fellow mining magnates, Cape Afrikaners, or even, on occasion, African notables and their subjects.<h2>
<a name="ThecommemorationandhistoriographyofCecilRhodes"></a>The commemoration and historiography of Cecil Rhodes</h2>There are numerous portraits, busts, statues, and photographs of Rhodes and he gave much time to sitting for a variety of portrait painters, sculptors, and photographers. Very few of the portraits have aesthetic merit although Rhodes seems to have been better served by sculptors. He was strongly impelled to bestow his likeness upon posterity and, after his death, a considerable number of portraits and statues were displayed in southern Africa and in Oxford and London. Portraits, busts, and statues were commissioned for, or presented to, government buildings, gardens, and squares, as well as to schools, the new South African universities, and gentlemen's clubs. These are to be found in Cape Town, Grahamstown, Kimberley, Johannesburg, and Bulawayo. In 1911, an elaborate memorial, consisting of a columned Doric portico approached by a long flight of steps flanked by Egyptian lions, was raised to him in the grounds of the Groote Schuur on the slopes of Table Mountain. Among the many portraits in Britain, especially striking are those by Edward Roworth in Rhodes House (brilliantly capturing the power of Rhodes's brooding, slightly sleazy character; this is a copy of the original in the University of Cape Town), A. Tennyson-Cole in Oriel College, Oxford, and G. F. Watts in the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>Rhodes was especially commemorated in Rhodes House, Oxford, built by the Rhodes trustees in 1928 to Sir Herbert Baker's plans with sculptures by Charles Wheeler and carvings by Laurence Turner. In this distinctive building&#151;part memorial, part office, part library&#151;imperial, art and craft, and Cape styles are brilliantly juxtaposed. Rhodes University at Grahamstown was founded in his memory in 1904.<br>
<br>In the years after Rhodes's death a large number of memoirs and biographies of variable quality were published, but it was not until the 1970s, with the publication of John Flint's biography, that a disinterested scholarly work appeared. This was followed by the works of Robert Rotberg and Apollon Davidson (respectively American and Russian historians), and the Israeli political scientist Mordechai Tamarkin. Economic and business histories by Newbury and Turrell have added much to our understanding of Rhodes's financial affairs. His career was portrayed in the 1936 British film <span class="italic">Rhodes of Africa</span> and, more critically, in a 1997 British television series.<br>
