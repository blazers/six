<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lardner,  Nathaniel</span>  (1684&#150;1768), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and patristic scholar</span>, was born at the Hall House, Hawkhurst, Kent, on 6 June 1684, the elder son of Richard Lardner (1653&#150;1740). He also had a sister, Elizabeth. His father, who was grandson of Thomas Lardner, a cordwainer at Portsmouth, was educated at the academy of Charles Morton (1626&#150;1698) and became an Independent minister. He served between 1673 and 1732 at Deal, at Plaisterer's Hall, London, and then at Chelmsford. Nathaniel's mother was a daughter of Nathaniel Collyer (or Collier), a Southwark tradesman who in the plague year, 1665, had retired to Hawkhurst. Lardner appears to have attended a grammar school, probably at Deal, and from there went to study at the Presbyterian academy in Hoxton Square, London, under Joshua Oldfield, assisted by John Spademan and William Lorimer. Towards the end of 1699 he accompanied Martin Tomkins to study at Utrecht. Daniel Neal, later his brother-in-law and a historian of puritanism, was among his fellow students. In the winter of 1702 he studied at Leiden.<br>
<br>In 1703 Lardner returned to London and joined the Independent church in Miles Lane, under Matthew Clarke the younger. He continued his studies for a further six years, and it was not until 2 August 1709, in Tomkins's pulpit at Stoke Newington, that he preached his first sermon. In 1713 Lardner became domestic chaplain to Lady Treby (formerly Mary Brinley), fourth wife and widow of Sir George Treby (<i>d</i>. 1700), chief justice of the common pleas. He was tutor to their youngest son, Brinley, and in 1716 travelled with him for four months in France and the Netherlands, keeping a journal of the tour. He was a contributor to <span class="italic">Occasional Papers</span> (1716&#150;19), its authors, six Presbyterians and two Independents, including&#151;at that time&#151;Lardner (in 1730 he became a Presbyterian), largely siding with Benjamin Hoadly in the Bangorian controversy, which erupted following Hoadly's sermon of 31 March 1717, in which he denied that there was biblical warrant for any visible churchly authorities.<br>
<br>Following Lady Treby's death at the beginning of 1721, Lardner went to live with his father in Hoxton Square, acting as his assistant (until 1729) at Hoxton Square meeting-house, though he was never formally ordained. He joined a literary club and a clerical club which met at Chew's Coffee House, Bow Lane. The death of his pupil Brinley Treby in 1723 greatly affected his spirits and health. He became very deaf; early in 1724 he wrote that when at public worship he could hear neither the preacher's voice nor the congregation singing. He was at this time taking part in a course of Tuesday evening lectures at the Old Jewry, instituted in 1723. Late in that year he also began another series of lectures, out of which grew a notable book, <span class="italic">The Credibility of the Gospel History</span> (12 vols., 1727&#150;55).<br>
<br>The appearance in February 1727 of the first two volumes of part one of Lardner's <span class="italic">Credibility</span> brought him into the front rank of Christian apologists. Further volumes appeared until the twelfth in 1755, which was followed by a supplement in 1756. Parts of the work were translated into Dutch, Latin, and German. However, he sold the copyright in 1768 for &pound;150, which was less than his original investment. On 24 August 1729 Lardner preached for William Harris at the Presbyterian meeting-house in Poor Jewry Lane, Crutched Friars. He had held Harris in high esteem since his youth, and the latter unexpectedly offered him a position as his assistant preacher, though he did not assume responsibility for pastoral care. At this period Lardner was engaged in an important correspondence on theological topics with John Shute Barrington, first Viscount Barrington. This eventually led to Lardner's publishing <span class="italic">A Letter &hellip; Concerning &hellip; the Logos</span> (1759).<br>
<br>Lardner almost died from a fever in 1728, and he experienced further ill health in 1736&#150;7. The death of his father, with whom he had continued to live, and of his ministerial colleague William Harris occurred in the same year, 1740. He was now urged to replace Harris as minister, but worries about ordination, deafness, and literary work held him back. He eventually decided to remain as assistant, and George Benson was elected pastor in November 1740. Lardner disliked engaging in religious disputes, and it is clear that he shrank from the ordeal of a theological examination and a detailed confession of faith.<br>
<br>It was primarily through his many and varied publications that Lardner became renowned. The collected edition of his <span class="italic">Works</span> first appeared in 1788 and ran to eleven volumes. Lardner regarded the average reader as capable of assessing the internal evidence for the historical character of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and thus he discussed the documentary writings of Josephus and other contemporaries of Jesus, as well as invoking later patristic authors. Lardner also brought together a pioneering collection of critically appraised materials for determining the date and authorship of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> books. His <span class="italic">A large collection of ancient Jewish and heathen testimonies to the truth of the Christian religion</span> appeared in 1764. He contributed extensively to patristic scholarship, and a number of works, including a history of the heretics of the first two centuries <span class="smallcap">AD</span>, were published posthumously. Lardner's scholarship was undoubtedly pioneering, and was not superseded until well into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>A friend of Archbishop Secker and the bishop of Chichester, Edward Waddington, Lardner also corresponded with such dissenters as John Brekell, Samuel Chandler, Philip Doddridge, and Henry Miles. He sent Doddridge some volumes of his <span class="italic">The Credibility of the Gospel History</span> in return for several gifts of Doddridge's works, and made observations on Celsus, Julian, and the Manichaeans. Thomas Morgan, the moral philosopher, who had written against revelation, addressed himself to Lardner, thinking he &#145;could not talk to any man of greater impartiality and integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings</span>, 59).<br>
<br>Lardner was, however, conservative in his acceptance of the miraculous element in the biblical narrations. Yet his treatment of demoniacal possession, which he attributed to &#145;bodily diseases and indispositions&#146; rather than to evil spirits as such  (<span class="italic">The Works of Nathaniel Lardner</span>, ed. B. Cole, 11 vols., 1788, 1.429&#150;96), was uncharacteristically rationalistic. All the more remarkable, therefore, was his independence of mind in relation to dogmatic theology. He regarded Christianity as &#145;a republication of the law of nature, with the two positive appointments of baptism and the Lord's Supper&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings</span>, 81). The gospel was advantageous because people &#145;needed to be awakened and excited to the practice of what they did know&#146;  (ibid., 83). At Salters' Hall in 1719, where the ostensible subject of discussion, the Trinity, was overshadowed by the issue of subscription, he was a nonsubscriber. He disowned the Arian doctrine which denied the co-equality of the Son with the Father; but for a time Lardner was attracted to the modified Arianism adhered to by the Anglican philosopher and theologian Samuel Clarke (1675&#150;1729) and by the dissenter James Peirce. By 1730 Lardner adhered to what he called the Nazarene doctrine of the Saviour's miraculous conception, as distinct from the Ebionite, according to which Jesus was the son of Joseph and Mary only. This opinion he taught from the pulpit as early as 1747, but did not publish it until 1759, and then anonymously.<br>
<br>Lardner was of slender build and middle height. He had a frank, intelligent face, and all accounts speak of his good humour and civility. Early in 1745 he received the diploma of DD from Marischal College, Aberdeen, and in June 1746 he was appointed a London correspondent of the Scottish Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. He retained his place as assistant until 1751; the smallness of the morning congregation was among his reasons for resigning, and he preached his last sermon on 23 June. His lack of popularity as a preacher was partly due to indistinct enunciation; he slurred his words and dropped his voice, defects to which his deafness rendered him insensible. From about 1753 communication with him was by writing only, and he amused himself when alone with looking over the sheets covered with the miscellaneous jottings of his visitors.<br>
<br>Lardner's old age was lonely. His brother, Richard, a barrister, died in April 1733, his brother-in-law, Daniel Neal, in 1743. In 1748, following the death of his sister Elizabeth, Neal's widow, he wrote that &#145;now all worldly friendships fade, and are worth little&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings</span>, 97). However, his literary activity and also his benevolence continued to the end of his life, and shortly before his death he exerted himself to procure aid for foreign protestants. Joseph Priestley often visited him, but when he did so in 1767 found his memory to be failing.<br>
<br>In July 1768, although quite feeble, Lardner took his annual journey to Hawkhurst, accompanied by one of his nieces and her husband. Although he reached Hawkhurst, Lardner died there on 24 July 1768. He was buried in his family vault in Bunhill Fields, London. His funeral, attended by a number of nonconformist ministers, including Caleb Fleming, Thomas Amory, and Richard Price, was very simple. Lardner had not wanted a funeral sermon, and so Ebenezer Radcliffe, his successor at Poor Jewry Lane, wrote an elogium, which he delivered at the graveside. In 1789 an inscribed marble slab was erected to his memory in Hawkhurst church by his great-nephew David Jennings. His library was sold in December 1768, many books from it eventually finding a home in Dr Williams's Library in London.<br>
