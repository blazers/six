<span class="headword">Grayson,  Cecil</span>  (1920&#150;1998), <span class="occ">Italian scholar</span>, was born on 5 February 1920 at 1 Court 6, Taylor Street, Batley, Yorkshire, the second son of John Grayson (<i>d</i>. 1926), boiler maker, and his wife, Dora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hartley (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1980), a seamstress. Educated at Batley grammar school and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, he obtained first-class honours in modern languages in 1947, his academic work interrupted by war service in India (1940&#150;46). In 1947 he married Margaret Parry Jordan (1922&#150;1999), with whom he had three daughters and a son. In 1948 he began teaching as university lecturer in Italian at Oxford; in 1958 he was elected to Oxford's Serena chair. At one time his pupils filled nearly half the Italian university teaching posts in Britain, and a goodly proportion of Commonwealth and American university teachers of Italian also counted him as their mentor.<br>
<br>When Professor Grayson was elected president of the Modern Humanities Research Association in 1987, his presidential address discussed the advantages and disadvantages of a literary life: the allusion to the <span class="italic">De commodis litterarum atque incommodis</span> of Leon Battista Alberti (1404&#150;1472) was clear to Renaissance specialists. It was the first of Alberti's writings on which he worked, a cautionary introduction which warns against expecting too many material rewards from academic life. His research was closely identified with the development of the so-called <i>nuova filologia</i> (&#145;new philology&#146;) as practised by scholars such as Michele Barbi, Vittorio Cian, and Carlo Dionisotti. Professor Grayson's was a similarly rigorous critical approach; he had little patience with the cavils of post-war literary criticism; his method, which depended upon verifiable literary and historical evidence, concentrated on detailed textual analysis.<br>
<br>In 1949 Grayson produced with Carlo Dionisotti an edition with commentary of <span class="italic">Early Italian Texts</span>. The <span class="italic">Opuscoli inediti di Leon Battista Alberti</span> (1954) firmly established his scholarly reputation, providing him with his first major edition and a breakthrough into the Italian academic hierarchy. For a quarter of a century after his election to the chair he was a vigorous co-editor of the journal <span class="italic">Italian Studies</span>. He became a natural choice as one of Britain's vice-presidents of the International Association of Italianists (AISLLI), which he served for forty years.<br>
<br>Professor Grayson's strong interest in Alberti continued with a brief but elaborate edition of an unpublished letter to Matteo de' Pasti, subtitled <span class="italic">Alberti and the Tempio Malatestiano</span>, published in 1957. And shortly afterwards he discovered and edited manuscripts of Vincenzo Colli (&#145;Il Calmeta&#146;), hardly known to scholarship before Grayson showed that here were the first pages of modern literary criticism; these he published as <span class="italic">Prose e lettere edite e inedite</span> in 1959. In 1960 his inaugural lecture appeared: <span class="italic">A Renaissance Controversy: Latin or Italian</span>. What began as an objective examination of the Italian <i>questione della lingua</i> provoked ideas which rumbled on for a decade, though Grayson treated it as a casual sideline; the argument reached its apogee in 1971 when his essay &#145;Machiavelli and Dante&#146; initiated further international debate. During that same period Professor Grayson had been engaged on his edition of the works of Alberti (<span class="italic">Opere volgari</span>), published in three ample volumes in 1960, 1966, and 1973. He also began editing Alberti's vernacular grammar, which he published in 1964 as <span class="italic">Leon Battista Alberti e la prima grammatica della lingua volgare</span>. In 1972 he edited Alberti's <span class="italic">On Painting and on Sculpture: the Latin Texts of De pictura and De statua</span>. His final Alberti edition was the text of <span class="italic">De pictura</span> (1980), though he published an English version in 1991.<br>
<br>Apart from his work on the Renaissance, Professor Grayson's essays on Dante's language and style, particularly in his <span class="italic">Cinque saggi su Dante</span> of 1972 and on the development of pre-Renaissance vernacular literature, became minor classics. He gave regular lectures on Dante and for a quarter of a century was president&#150;secretary of the Oxford Dante Society, whose essays he edited for Oxford University Press in <span class="italic">The World of Dante</span> in 1980; he celebrated the tenth anniversary of his own retirement by giving Oxford's Paget Toynbee Dante lectures. In 1965 he edited for Oxford University Press a selection from Francesco Guicciardini, translated by his wife, Margaret. He also translated three of the historical biographies of Roberto Ridolfi (Savonarola, Machiavelli, and Guicciardini), items he considered part of his relaxation.<br>
<br>Cecil Grayson had an imposing international reputation beyond Europe. In the United States he enjoyed many fellowships or visiting professorships: fellow in residence at Chicago's Newberry Library in 1965; and visiting professor at Yale (1966), Berkeley (1969 and 1973), UCLA (1980, 1984, 1987, and 1994), and New York University, where he taught for the whole of the academic year 1995&#150;6 when already seventy-six years of age. He undertook long stints as visiting professor at Cape Town (1980 and 1983) and Perth (1973 and 1980), and was a frequent visitor to South Africa and the Antipodes.<br>
<br>Professor Grayson was elected to Italy's most prestigious academies: the Lincei, the Crusca, Arcadia, the Istituto Veneto, and Bologna's Commissione per i Testi di Lingua and Accademia delle Scienze; in 1974 he was given the international Galileo prize, and in 1976 the British Academy's Serena gold medal, three years before his election to the Academy itself. His CBE in 1992 was anticipated by Italy seventeen years earlier with the title of Commendatore dell'ordine al merito. The honorary fellowship awarded him in 1986 at his old college, St Edmund Hall, gave him particular pleasure. At his retirement dinner he was presented with the nearest that Oxford approaches to a Festschrift: <span class="italic">The Languages of Literature in Renaissance Italy</span> (1988), edited by his Oxford colleagues; in 1997 another Oxford University Press volume, <span class="italic">Dante and Governance</span>, was dedicated to him, marking the anniversary of his retirement. He lived in Oxford from 1947 to 1998, principally at 11 Norham Road, though he enjoyed much time at his cottage in Pembrokeshire acquired in 1960. In 1998 the city council of Mantua nominated him for honorary citizenship; he was preparing to attend the ceremony when he was taken into the John Radcliffe Hospital, where he died of coronary thrombosis on 29 April 1998. He was cremated in Oxford.<br>
