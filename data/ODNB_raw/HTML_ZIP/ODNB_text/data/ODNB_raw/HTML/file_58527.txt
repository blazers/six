<span class="headword">Hertz,  Mathilde Carmen</span>  (1891&#150;1975), <span class="occ">animal psychologist and sensory physiologist</span>, was born on 14 January 1891 at Quantiusstrasse 13, Bonn, Germany, the second of two daughters of physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (1857&#150;1894), famous for discovering electromagnetic waves, and his wife, Elisabeth (1864&#150;1942?), daughter of geodesy professor Max Doll of Karlsruhe. Following her father's death her mother, to supplement meagre resources, kept boarders, among whom was Maria Gr&auml;fin von Linden. One of the first women to hold a senior scientific research post in a German university von Linden strongly influenced the Hertz daughters.<br>
<br>Mathilde Hertz attended the state Realgymnasium (high school) in Bonn until Easter 1910, then studied art in Weimar, Karlsruhe, and Berlin. She became a sculptor, but from 1918 until 1923 also worked in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. When assisting palaeontologist Ludwig D&ouml;derlein in modelling fossil teeth she became interested in zoology, and in 1921 enrolled at Munich University. She was awarded a doctorate <i>summa cum laude</i> in 1925, following research on primitive mammalian teeth.<br>
<br>Mathilde Hertz remained in Munich working on zoological classification until 1927, when, having become increasingly interested in animal psychology, she moved to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem as visiting scientist. She became a permanent assistant in 1929 following publication of several notable papers on shape perception and memory in crows and jays. Work on perception capabilities in a variety of animals followed, including outstanding studies on contour and colour recognition in bees. At the German Zoological Society's 1929 Marburg Congress she set out her approach, in which she used the gestalt psychology concept of the learned organized whole in understanding sensory development; her theories de-emphasized the role of instinct. Now prominent nationally she was appointed lecturer at Berlin University in 1930, one of few women to hold such a post. Her programme of lectures and seminars in animal psychology and sensory physiology ended in 1933 when her teaching licence was withdrawn because of National Socialist government regulations restricting the employment of women and Jews. One quarter Jewish by ancestry (although protestant by baptism and upbringing), she nevertheless succeeded in keeping her research position at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute until 1935 when she emigrated to Britain.<br>
<br>With help from her father's friend, physicist J. J. Thomson, and from biologist A. D. Imms, Mathilde Hertz settled in Cambridge, supported by an Academic Assistance Council grant. Further financial aid came from the radio industry in recognition of her father's pioneering work. In 1936 her mother and sister joined her. Although she never held a formal position at Cambridge University, for a time she collaborated with Imms at the zoological laboratory in investigations on migratory locusts, while also continuing her own studies on bees. In 1939, however, after ten years of productive work and more than thirty notable publications, she gave up research. Poor health and shortage of money were hindrances, but also her field was changing; the work of Konrad Lorenz and other continental ethologists, which emphasized the role of instinct, was largely displacing the gestalt theoretical approach she had followed. Fifty years were to lapse before neurophysiologists rediscovered her studies on optical perception in bees.<br>
<br>Throughout the Second World War Mathilde Hertz remained committed to Germany and kept her German citizenship, although her stubbornly held views in these matters caused a serious family quarrel. Some financial assistance continued, and she had at least occasional meetings with Cambridge biologists. In 1956 she was contacted by physicist Max von Laue, then organizing the Heinrich Hertz centenary celebrations. He found her partly blind and too proud to ask for help, barely subsisting on an income more suited to the 1930s. He arranged a German government pension for her plus additional support channelled through the Max Planck Society.<br>
<br>During her last twenty years Mathilde Hertz rarely left Cambridge except for occasional visits to Hamburg relatives, who knew her as &#145;Crow-auntie&#146;. At the time of her death from heart failure, at her home, 3 St Margaret's Road, Girton, Cambridge, on 20 November 1975, she was co-editing a second edition of memoirs of her father. She was buried in the Hertz family plot in Olsdorfer cemetery, Hamburg.<br>
