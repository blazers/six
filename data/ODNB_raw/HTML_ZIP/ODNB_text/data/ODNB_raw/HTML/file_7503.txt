</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dennis,  John</span>  (1658&#150;1734), <span class="occ">literary critic</span>, was born on 16 September 1658 in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn, London, the only child of Francis Dennis (<i>d</i>. 1663), a saddler, and Sarah Dennis (<i>d</i>. 1709/10), who later married Thomas Sanderson, who was also a saddler, with whom she had a daughter, Dennis's half-sister Elizabeth.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Dennis was educated at Harrow School under Dr William Horne. He was elected orator in 1674. On 13 January 1676 he matriculated from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he held one of Harrow's two founder's exhibitions, and took his BA in 1679. On reaching his majority, Dennis inherited a bequest of &pound;500 from Simon Eve, his paternal uncle, an alderman of London. He remained in residence but his career at the college came to an end following an incident with a fellow student: on 4 March 1680, he was mulcted &pound;3, deprived of his scholarship, and obliged to leave after attacking and wounding Charles Glenham. Dennis moved to Trinity Hall in 1681. There, in 1683, he took his MA, and with that qualification, but not on the foundation of the college, it is probable that he worked as a tutor until 1686.<br>
<br>In that year Dennis brought a chancery suit against his mother. She had defrauded him, he claimed, of the interest on his uncle's bequest. Her son had become an unfilial spendthrift, his mother countered. It is likely that the family arrived at an out-of-court settlement. By 1688 he could afford to accompany one of his former Harrow schoolmates, Lord Francis Seymour, on the grand tour. Theirs was the traditional itinerary; the letter in which Dennis describes crossing the Alps into Italy is an early expression of the romantic sublime. The record of his travels is coloured, however, by a hostility to absolutist, Catholic Europe which permanently darkened his political thought. &#145;I mortally hate them&#146;, he wrote of the French  (J. Dennis, <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Verse and Prose</span>, 1693, 126).<h2>
<a name="Embarksonaliterarycareer"></a>Embarks on a literary career</h2>On his return Dennis determined on a literary career. Supported by his private income, he established himself in London as a modish man of letters, publishing occasional verse (fables, translations, and self-conscious exercises in wit, some of which were collected in <span class="italic">Poems in Burlesque</span>, 1692, and his <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>) and several Pindaric odes, including <span class="italic">The Court of Death</span> (1695), dedicated to the memory of Queen Mary, and <span class="italic">The Nuptials of Britain's Genius and Fame</span> (1697), on the conclusion of the Nine Years' War. He cultivated the leading literary figures, Dryden, Wycherley, and Congreve among them. At the same time, and with an eye on his dwindling fortune, Dennis also courted statesmen. A committed but independent whig, he was proud that his literary works had been favourably received by &#145;the late Earls of <i>Godolphin</i> and <i>Halifax</i>, Mr. <i>Maynwaring</i> and others among the Whigs&#146;, he recalled in 1719, &#145;and by the present Duke of <i>Buckingham</i> and my Lord <i>Lansdown</i> among the Tories&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Works</span>, 2.173). Rewards were none the less modest and infrequent. His greatest success followed the publication of <span class="italic">Britannia triumphans</span> (1704), a celebration of the victory at Blenheim: the duke of Marlborough gave Dennis 100 guineas and obtained for him the position of queen's waiter at the Port of London, a sinecure worth &pound;52 a year.<br>
<br>A place, however exiguous, compensated for the inheritance Dennis had spent. With neither vocation nor profession to fall back on, he had also turned to the theatre. Dennis wrote several plays which achieved, at best, modest success: <span class="italic">A Plot, and No Plot</span> (1697), a farcical comedy; <span class="italic">Rinaldo and Armida</span> (1698), a dramatic opera with musical passages written mainly by John Eccles, which freely adapted Tasso's <span class="italic">Gerusalemme liberata</span> (1575); <span class="italic">Iphigenia</span> (1699), based on Euripides and supported by Colonel Christopher Codrington, who encouraged his friends to attend the author's benefit; and <span class="italic">The Comical Gallant</span> (1702), a farcical adaptation of <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, which quickly closed (Dennis was the first to record the tradition that Shakespeare wrote the play at Queen Elizabeth's command). With <span class="italic">Liberty Asserted</span> (1704) Dennis achieved his one theatrical success, an anti-French story set in Canada so successful (it was performed ten times between 24 February and 16 March 1704, and again on 27 March) that the author&#151;it is claimed&#151;feared the French would seek his extradition under the terms of the treaty of Utrecht. He sought Marlborough's help. The duke could not assist him, however; &#145;indeed he had taken no Care to get himself exempted in the Articles of Peace&#146;, John Mottley's drily aristocratic account relates, &#145;and he could not help thinking, that he had done the <i>French</i> almost as much Damage as Mr. <i>Dennis</i> himself&#146;  (Mottley, 214). A year later <span class="italic">Gibraltar</span> (1705), Dennis's weakest play, fell after two performances. <span class="italic">The Masque of Orpheus and Euridice</span> (published 1707) was probably never performed. For the production of <span class="italic">Appius and Virginia</span> (1709), which ran for three noisy nights, Dennis improved the mustard bowl device in which stage managers created claps of thunder. His advance is remembered in English idiom. At a performance of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> shortly after his own play had closed, tradition tells that Dennis heard deep rumbling off-stage. &#145;Damn them!&#146;, he is said to have exclaimed, &#145;they will not let my play run, but they steal my thunder&#146;. According to the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> this was the origin of the figurative expression, but the incident is more likely to be apocryphal, a story Pope put about to further his own image of the critic. Dennis wrote one more play in 1710, but it was not performed for several years.<h2>
<a name="Declineinfortune"></a>Decline in fortune</h2>The second decade of the eighteenth century marked a decline in Dennis's fortunes. Frequently ill (he suffered from gout, fevers, stones, increasing weight, and deteriorating sight), he retired from the metropolitan world of clubs and coffee houses in 1705. His finances remained uncertain. Since at least 1710 Dennis had found work as a notary public, empowered to act as an agent and banker. Although he had taken the cause of Royal Navy ratings before parliament (<span class="italic">The Seamens Case</span>, 1699?) and had published a couple of pamphlets on naval affairs (<span class="italic">An Essay on the Navy</span>, 1702, and <span class="italic">A Proposal for Putting a Speedy End to the War</span>, 1703), in which he reveals an impressive command of detail and sympathy for the sailor's plight, he was twice accused of defrauding seamen of their wages. At some date after May 1711, insolvent, he left the capital. An examining commission declared him bankrupt in August 1711; days later Granville wrote to Robert, earl of Oxford, the lord high treasurer, reminding him that Dennis had made various proposals for raising revenue, including a new tax calculated to assist merchant shipping, and recommending that he be helped. Dennis acknowledged Granville, who stepped in when the ministry failed to act, in the dedication to <span class="italic">An Essay on the Genius and Writings of Shakespear</span> (1712) but relief was temporary; corporation records show that he was discharged from the Fleet, where he had been imprisoned for debt, in January 1713 (he may even have been held there as a debtor as early as 1696, but identification is not certain). At times during this period Dennis lived within the verges of the court, where he was safe from arrest, but in March 1716 he sold his waitership to Benjamin Hudson for &pound;600, to which he attached a fifteen-year reversion (he was fifty-seven at the time of the sale), and for at least four years he &#145;lodg'd continually in the Neighbourhood of <i>White-hall</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Works</span>, 2.212). He continued to divide his year between the capital and the country. Throughout his life, for months at a time, Dennis sought seclusion, particularly in Northamptonshire and at Cobham, in Surrey; &#145;who that has Quails and <i>Burgundy</i> before him&#146;, he asked Thomas Sergeant, &#145;would leave them for <i>Porter</i> and Ram Mutton?&#146;  (Dennis, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 127).<h2>
<a name="Thecritic"></a>The critic</h2>Dennis is now best remembered as a critic. His first substantial works, <span class="italic">The Impartial Critick</span> (1693), a Socratic dialogue in five conversational parts, and <span class="italic">Remarks on a Book, Entitul'd Prince Arthur</span> (1696), were both directed at opponents of Dryden. <span class="italic">Letters upon Several Occasions</span> (1696) gathered correspondence on a variety of literary and critical topics, including a couple of thoughtful letters to Congreve on Ben Jonson and dramatic comedy. Dennis also wrote political defences of the theatre. <span class="italic">The Usefulness of the Stage to Religion</span> (1698) was a subtle first reply to the Revd Jeremy Collier's principled, anti-Williamite attacks, and in both &#145;The causes of the decay and defects of dramatick poetry&#146; (1725?), one of a number of manuscripts held by the printer against money borrowed and unpublished in the author's life, and <span class="italic">The Stage Defended</span> (1726), he argued that government regulation of the theatres had social, political, and religious benefits.<br>
<br>The works Dennis published in the first years of the eighteenth century established his reputation. <span class="italic">The Advancement and Reformation of Modern Poetry</span> (1701) revisits the ancients and moderns controversy to propose a return to verse inspired by, and responsive to, Christian precepts. <span class="italic">The Grounds of Criticism in Poetry</span> (1704) invokes and amplifies many of the principles aired in the earlier account, including Horatian senses of Aristotelian good order (at some point before 1702 Dennis had translated the <span class="italic">Ars poetica</span> into verse), passion, the sublime, and the place of religion in literature, but it was no mere recapitulation; the contents of the volume were a small part of what had been intended to be an ambitious subscription which would formulate the rules for each genre and include critical biographies of selected English poets. Fewer than eighty readers underwrote the edition, however, and Dennis was obliged to publish only what he had gathered.<br>
<br>In 1711 an occasional series of articles appeared in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> which disparaged critics. Dennis was particularly angered by no. 40 (16 April 1711), which attacked the theory of poetic justice (the idea that characters' fortunes should be determined by their moral conduct), a notion which Dennis had attempted to dramatize in his own plays and whose inclusion in the article he took as a personal affront. He replied in numerous letters to the periodical; a selection was first published as an appendix to his essay on Shakespeare. Addison kept his counsel. With relations strained, and in the face of the greatest dramatic success of the day, it was an act of critical independence, and courage, for Dennis to publish his <span class="italic">Remarks upon Cato</span> (1713), a formal account of how Addison's play suffers from its strict adherence to the dramatic unities. Johnson reprinted approvingly long extracts in his life of the essayist. Dennis was eventually reconciled to Addison but remained suspicious of Richard Steele's (blameless) hand in the articles.<br>
<br>Worse was to come. In a political act, Colley Cibber was deprived of his position at the Theatre Royal. Steele, the patentee of Drury Lane since 1715, wrote in his defence, in favour of the actor&#150;managers whom Dennis blamed for the year-long delays in the production of his final play, <span class="italic">The Invader of his Country</span> (1719), an adaptation of <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>, and its brief run. The four letters which form the two parts of <span class="italic">The Characters and Conduct of Sir John Edgar</span> (1720) turn from a libel of Cibber to a vigorously <i>ad hominem</i> attack on Steele, on his humble birth, his financial imprudence, his plagiarism, and dishonesty. In his <span class="italic">A Defence of Sir Fopling Flutter</span> (1722) and <span class="italic">Remarks on a Play, Call'd The Conscious Lovers</span> (1723), Dennis maintained the virtues of robustly realistic comedy against the type of sentimental romance Steele had sedulously promoted.<br>
<br>Pope was scarcely on nodding acquaintance with Dennis when he included him in <span class="italic">An Essay on Criticism</span> (1711):<blockquote>
<div>
<i>Appius</i> reddens at each Word you speak,<br>
</div>
<div>And <i>stares</i>, <i>Tremendous</i>! with a <i>threatning Eye</i>,<br>
</div>
<div>Like some <i>fierce Tyrant</i> in <i>Old Tapestry</i>.<br>
</div> (ll. 585&#150;7)</blockquote>Dennis unwittingly confirmed Pope's compression of insight and association in his <span class="italic">Reflections Critical and Satyrical, upon a Late Rhapsody, Call'd, An Essay on Criticism</span> (1711). The cumulative effect of Pope's subsequent literary and personal ridicule in, among others, <span class="italic">The Narrative of Dr Robert Norris</span> (1713), the Scriblerian collaborations <span class="italic">Three Hours after Marriage</span> (1717), in which Dennis appears briefly as Sir Tremendous Longinus, and <span class="italic">Peri Bathous</span> (1728), and, further, <span class="italic">The Dunciad: An Heroic Poem, in Three Books</span> (1728), was to suggest that the critic was lunatic: &#145;And all the Mighty Mad in Dennis rage&#146;  (A. Pope, <span class="italic">Dunciad variorum</span>, 1729, 1.104). In his own replies, <span class="italic">A True Character of Mr Pope and his Writings</span> (1716), printed without his permission, <span class="italic">Remarks upon Mr. Pope's Translation of Homer</span> (1717), and <span class="italic">Remarks on Mr Pope's Rape of the Lock</span> (1728), to which he added a preface on the attacks of 1728, Dennis let indignation get the better of him; acute close readings of individual lines (later editions of <span class="italic">An Essay on Criticism</span> silently incorporated several changes as a result) often give way to abuse of his adversary's physique and disabilities, his religion, politics, and commercial success. Only in <span class="italic">Remarks upon Several Passages in the Preliminaries to the Dunciad</span> (1729), a much cooler and more various response, did Dennis arrive at a winningly disinterested tone. Few noticed.<h2>
<a name="Nonliterarywritings"></a>Non-literary writings</h2>Throughout his career Dennis commented on topics of public interest. His non-literary prose includes works on morality; both <span class="italic">An Essay on the Opera's after the Italian Manner</span> (1706) and <span class="italic">An Essay upon Publick Spirit</span> (1711) denigrate foreign influences on the nation; <span class="italic">Julius Caesar Acquitted</span> (1722) was Dennis's reply to a republican advocate of political murder, and <span class="italic">Vice and Luxury Publick Mischiefs</span> (1724) reacted to a new, expanded edition of Bernard Mandeville's <span class="italic">The Fable of the Bees</span> (1714; 1723). Dennis's religious tracts (<span class="italic">The Danger of Priestcraft to Religion and Government</span> (1702), the first of his works to sell widely, and <span class="italic">Priestcraft Distinguish'd from Christianity</span> (1715), a very popular anti-Jacobite pamphlet which had run to a third edition by 1718) were broadly protestant in their sympathies, as were two later works, <span class="italic">The Faith and Duties of Christians</span> (1728), a translation of the Revd Thomas Burnet's <span class="italic">De fide et officiis Christianorum</span>, and <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning the State of Departed Souls</span> (1730), which rendered Burnet's <span class="italic">De statu mortuorum et resurgentium</span>.<br>
<br>These translations, composed at the request of Burnet's literary executor, were completed in poor health and with failing sight. Dennis's final years, spent in blind infirmity, were wretched. He did not marry, although one story uniquely records &#145;the son of the critic&#146; threatening violent revenge on the poet  (<span class="italic">The Works of Alexander Pope</span>, ed. W. Elwin and W. J. Courthope, 10 vols., 1871&#150;86, 8.237, n. 3). In old age, for Dennis, therefore, having outlived the reversion on the sale of his waitership, patronage became alms: since 1724 the earl of Pembroke had remembered the critic with occasional presents of 5 or 10 guineas, Atterbury sent &pound;100 from his French exile in 1730, and, although he had never been a hired pen, Walpole found &pound;20 for him for several years. In January 1725 and January 1731 benefit performances of <span class="italic">The Old Bachelor</span> and <span class="italic">Volpone</span> were staged for Dennis; on 18 December 1733 a performance of <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span> at the Haymarket, organized by Thomson, Mallet, Martin, and Pope (who anonymously supplied an equivocal prologue), was given for his benefit.<br>
<br>By his own admission, Dennis almost always wrote in haste. He revised little and left the transmission of what were often first and only drafts to the discretion of the printer. For a time, though, in the first decade of the eighteenth century, Dennis was England's leading critic, an elegant prose stylist possessed of a shrewd and perceptive literary intelligence. Subsequent generations have always acknowledged his abilities but his reputation gradually dwindled in the face of what others, Pope especially, said he had done. In his early championing of Milton, however, his emphasis on the psychological effects of the sublime, and in his contribution to the development of Wordsworth's and Coleridge's critical thought, Dennis's importance has begun to be recognized. And at his best, Dennis was capable of searchingly acute observation: the blank verse of Shakespeare's tragedies, he noticed, was complicated by polysyllabic line endings which paradoxically domesticate the speech of the characters, close reading he demonstrates at once: &#145;Such Verse we make when we are writing Prose; we make such Verse in common Conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Works</span>, 2.5). The pity of his life was the moment he looked up from his studies at the world, and more particularly the people, around him. Dennis died on 6 January 1734 and was buried in the parish church of St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
