<span class="headword">Sumner, Sir  John</span>  (1856&#150;1934), <span class="occ">tea merchant</span>, was born on 25 February 1856 at 97 High Street, Birmingham, the elder son of John Sumner (1824&#150;1907), grocer and druggist of Birmingham and Coleshill, and his first wife, Ann (1825&#150;1869), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lees.<br>
<br>The family grocery and druggist business was founded in 1820 by William Sumner (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1796) and passed in 1852 to his sons John (senior) and William. In 1863 John, author of <span class="italic">A Popular Treatise on Tea</span> (1863), took specific responsibility for the grocery trade, while his brother ran the adjacent chemist's and druggist's. Sumner was educated at a private school in Moseley before entering his father's business. In 1894 the business was transferred to Hutton House, 25/26 High Street, Birmingham, to premises built by the noted local antiquary and historian William Hutton. From there Sumner &#145;rescued&#146; the Priory Stone, which he presented to Birmingham Museum. This episode aside, there was little to distinguish Sumner from the majority of successful provincial grocers of his day until in 1903 he began to packet and market the tips of tea leaves or &#145;fannings&#146;.<br>
<br>Until then the market had been dominated by whole leaf tea, and these siftings had been thought to be of little or no commercial value, but Sumner successfully promoted them as a cure for indigestion and nervous disorders and sold them through chemists and grocers under the brand name &#145;Typhoo Tipps&#146;. In 1905 he sold his retail business to finance the creation of Sumner's &#145;Typhoo&#146; Tea Ltd, a private company which relied on financial backing from family members and from J. H. Brindley, founder and director of the Priory Tea and Coffee Company in Dale End, Birmingham.<br>
<br>Rapid expansion followed through the adoption of aggressive marketing of the brand and in 1909 Sumner visited Ceylon to secure supplies, establishing an agency to buy, blend, and ship tea ready for packaging in Birmingham. Until the early 1920s these tea imports were stored in bonded warehouses in London, Liverpool, Manchester, and Avonmouth, but between 1923 and 1925 new canal-side packaging and storage facilities were developed in Birmingham enabling the firm to operate completely independently from the London tea market. By the early 1930s Typhoo was retailed from over 40,000 outlets, making it one of the most popular packet teas in Britain. When asked on one occasion to describe his business methods Sumner emphasized &#145;close personal supervision&#146; in the early stages of his career, and &#145;absolute freedom from routine&#146; with the confidence to delegate to &#145;the right type of man and woman&#146; as the firm grew  (<span class="italic">Worcester Daily Times</span>, 12 May 1934).<br>
<br>In 1926 Sumner passed control of the firm to his son and began to channel his energies into a wide range of charitable and public activities in Birmingham and the west midlands. In 1927 he founded the John Sumner Trust to promote works and objects of humanity, public utility, education, and research and to provide financial support for deserving persons not adequately provided for against infirmity and old age. This was followed in 1930 by the Colehaven Trust to finance the building in Coleshill of the Colehaven endowed homes for gentlewomen in reduced circumstances and failing health. He also took an active interest in the management of local hospitals, including the Birmingham nerve, children's, and general hospitals, Bromsgrove Cottage Hospital, and Worcester Royal Infirmary. He was a member of the Anti-Vivisection Society and, after retiring to Ham Court, Powick, near Worcester, joined Worcester Archaeological Society and became president of the Worcester branch of the National Citizens' Union.<br>
<br>Sumner married Martha Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Potter, farmer of Coleshill, on 22 August 1885; they had one son. Sumner retained an interest in country life throughout his life. In his younger days he hunted with South Staffordshire hounds; in retirement he pursued farming, topiary, landscape gardening, and forestry as hobbies. As a staunch Conservative, Sumner did much to support the party's cause in the west midlands and was rewarded with a knighthood in June 1932 in recognition of his philanthropic and political services.<br>
<br>Sumner died on 11 May 1934 at Ham Court, of prostate cancer. His funeral service at Powick parish church on 15 May was attended by representatives of the firm and all the organizations with which he had been associated. Cremation followed at Perry Barr, Birmingham, and his ashes were placed in the family vault in Coleshill cemetery. He was survived by his wife. His son, J. R. Hugh Sumner, succeeded him as chairman of the company; his nephew, Roland Sumner Kneale, became general manager.<br>
