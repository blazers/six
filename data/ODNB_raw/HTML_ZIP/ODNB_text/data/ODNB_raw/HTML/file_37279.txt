<span class="headword">Chidley,  Samuel</span>  (<em>b. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> in or after 1672), <span class="occ">Leveller and pamphleteer</span>, was baptized on 13 September 1618 (two years after he was born) at St Chad's, Shrewsbury, the first of eight children of Daniel Chidley (<i>fl</i>. 1616&#150;1649), tailor of Shrewsbury, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37278/', "Katherine Chidley (fl. 1616&#150;1653)")</script>. His parents were religious separatists who, to escape persecution, fled to London at the end of the 1620s. Daniel became free of the Haberdashers' Company in 1632, and apprenticed Samuel to the same trade in 1634. Samuel was made free of the company in 1649.<br>
<br>In the 1630s the Chidleys were active in separatist circles and assisted John Lilburne in his struggle against the bishops. Samuel, who lived with his mother until 1652 or later, collaborated with her in the 1640s in campaigning for religious freedom and upholding the autonomy of individual congregations. A believer in infant baptism, Chidley was also a vehement sabbatarian and iconoclast, who denounced the observance of Christmas.<br>
<br>In the mid-1640s Chidley became active in the Leveller movement. From the time of the Putney debates (October 1647), if not before, he was a treasurer for the Leveller party. In November 1647 he was at Ware promoting the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> among the mutinous troops of the army of Thomas Fairfax. For his pains the House of Commons put him in gaol. His sojourn there was brief, because in January 1648 he was active in promoting the Leveller Smithfield petition.<br>
<br>With the collapse of the Leveller movement in 1649 Chidley turned his energies to building a separatist congregation in London, promoting social reform, and enriching himself on the spoils of revolution. Besides publishing pamphlets and organizing petitions, he brought out a short-lived newspaper, the <span class="italic">Flying Eagle</span> (November&#150;December 1652), in which he denounced the abuses of the day. These included the non-payment of military arrears, the excise tax, the slowness and excessive centralization of justice, and hanging for theft. On the latter subject Chidley published his most famous tract, <span class="italic">A Cry Against a Crying Sinne</span> (1652; reprinted 1657).<br>
<br>Radical activism did not hinder Chidley from treading the path to prosperity during the 1650s. In 1649 he was appointed a registrar of military debentures. From his vantage point in Worcester House he became involved in the speculative buying of soldiers' bills, with which he made fifteen purchases of crown land, mostly on behalf of other men. Thus he acquired the manor of Greens-Norton in Northamptonshire, only to sell it back to thirteen of its tenants. In London, however, he seems to have hung on to most of the properties he bought in St Giles-in-the-Fields and High Holborn for over &pound;3300.<br>
<br>Chidley's financial dealings led to a number of lawsuits, accusations of fraud, and charges of dealing in forged debentures, but nothing was ever proved against him. Before the end of the interregnum he had amassed a modest fortune and had begun styling himself gentleman. Some time before 1658 he married. In 1659 he and his wife, Mary, were charged in king's bench with &#145;grievously and dangerously&#146; beating their servant girl  (TNA: PRO, KB 9/880/222). The outcome of the trial is not known.<br>
<br>As it did to other &#145;new men&#146; of lower social status who prospered in the 1650s, the Restoration spelt economic ruin for Chidley. In spite of Charles II's promise at Breda not to touch the sales of confiscated lands, parliament voted that the crown lands should be resumed by the king. Compounding this misfortune, Chidley landed in prison in 1664 for his refusal to swear the oath of allegiance and supremacy. While we do not know whether he had children, we do read that in 1665 his whole family was carried off by the plague. The following year most of his remaining property was destroyed in the fire. In 1668 he found himself in gaol once again, this time on a charge of disturbing the peace. By 1672, bereft of family and fortune, he had returned to Shrewsbury, where he occupied a dwelling of only one hearth. His date of death is unknown.<br>
