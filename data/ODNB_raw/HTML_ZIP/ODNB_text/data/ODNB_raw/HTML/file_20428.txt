<span class="headword">Oakes,  Urian</span>  (<em>c.</em>1631&#150;1681), <span class="occ">ejected minister and college head</span>, was born in England, possibly in or near London, the son of Edward Oakes (<i>c</i>.1604&#150;1689), yeoman and Massachusetts Bay Colony representative, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. after 1691). The English origins of the Oakes family are obscure; the family does not emerge from the shadows until 1640, when Edward and Jane arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with at least two children including Urian, then about nine years old. Edward Oakes quickly became a community leader; he served Cambridge as a selectman beginning in 1642 and as a representative to the colony's general court from 1659. During King Philip's War he was an officer in the Massachusetts militia.<br>
<br>After local preparation Oakes entered Harvard College in 1645. He graduated four years later and became a tutor at the college while he read for the ministry. He received his master's degree in 1652. Like many of his Harvard contemporaries, Oakes believed that his best opportunities for a good settlement lay in England. He returned home in 1654 and served briefly as a private chaplain before settling in the parish of Titchfield, Hampshire, in 1656. This sojourn lasted until 1662, when he fell victim to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, was deprived of his living, and forbidden to preach. Oakes briefly became the master of the grammar school in Southwick, Hampshire, where he ministered to a nonconformist congregation with Richard Symmonds, the ejected curate there. Oakes must have married during his early years in Titchfield, because his eldest son, also Urian, was born in or about 1657. Two other children were born in England, a son, Edward, and a daughter, Hannah. Tradition holds that Oakes's wife was Ruth, the daughter of the theologian William Ames, but there is no evidence to support this conclusion, and his wife's identity is uncertain. She was dead by 1669.<br>
<br>Jonathan Mitchell, the minister to the church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, died in 1668, and in the ensuing months Oakes was invited to return as Mitchell's successor. He travelled to Cambridge during the summer of 1671 and was installed as the church's pastor the following November 8. From his new pulpit he expressed the fear, common among New England's puritan clergy in the 1670s, that the region was suffering severely from spiritual and moral decay. In his four published sermons he warned New Englanders that their lapses of faith and conduct jeopardized both their individual prospects for salvation and their community's special relationship with God, who had made them, they believed, his chosen people in succession to the tribes of Israel. As a minister of one of the six original towns of the colony, Oakes automatically assumed a seat on one of Harvard College's two governing bodies, the board of overseers; in 1672 he was also elected to the other, the corporation, which oversaw the institution's daily affairs. Oakes promptly resigned from the corporation when he lost confidence in President Leonard Hoar, whose stern administration alienated most of the undergraduates. Hoar in turn resigned the presidency in 1675 when it became apparent that he could not regain the respect of the students.<br>
<br>Widely respected as New England's most capable Latinist and the minister of one of the region's most visible churches, Oakes was an obvious candidate to succeed to Harvard's presidency. Reluctant to give up his church, however, and aware of rumours that he had intentionally undermined Hoar through his resignation from the corporation, Urian accepted the position only on an acting basis while the college's governors attempted to make a permanent appointment. When several candidates refused the office, Urian finally acceded in 1680, making it a condition that he would retain his pulpit.<br>
<br>As president Oakes oversaw a small institution. Only thirty-one students graduated during his presidency, although this number included several of the colony's future leaders, notably Cotton Mather. The second Harvard Hall (1678), the college's major edifice until it was destroyed by fire in 1764, was completed during Oakes's tenure. Surviving addresses in Latin (in which he punned on his short stature) and a printed elegy in English confirm his reputation as an eloquent orator as well as the most capable poet of his era in New England. Oakes died of a fever at Cambridge on 25 July 1681, and was buried there.<br>

<a name="cosubject_20428"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Oakes</span>  (1644&#150;1719), <span class="occ">politician in America</span>, brother of Urian Oakes, was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 18 June 1644. He graduated from Harvard with the class of 1662, then trained as a physician. One of the colony's most prominent doctors, he also became active in government. In 1689 Boston elected him to the Massachusetts house of representatives, which chose him as speaker. Between 1690 and 1692, he was part of a mission to the royal court to secure a new charter for the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Upon his return from London, Oakes fell foul of Governor Joseph Dudley, who repeatedly nullified his election to the governor's council. Oakes died in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, on 15 July 1719. His wife, Martha (<i>c</i>.1649&#150;1719), had died the previous April.<br>
