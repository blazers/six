<span class="headword">Carline,  Richard Cotton</span>  (1896&#150;1980), <span class="occ">painter and writer</span>, was born at 72 Woodstock Road, Oxford, on 9 February 1896, the youngest of the five children (four sons and one daughter) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64264/', "George Francis Carline (1855&#150;1920)")</script>, painter, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73991/', "Annie Carline (1862&#150;1945)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64713/', "Carline family")</script>], in later life also a painter, daughter of John Smith, of Buckhurst Hill. As a painter Carline also followed earlier family generations, as well as his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64239/', "Sydney Carline (1888&#150;1929)")</script> and only sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64263/', "Hilda Carline (1889&#150;1950)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64713/', "Carline family")</script>]. After attending the Dragon and St Edward's schools in Oxford he studied art from 1913 under Percyval Tudor-Hart at his schools first in Paris and then in Hampstead, being influenced by Tudor-Hart's theories of colour and tonal value.<br>
<br>In 1916 Carline joined the Middlesex regiment before serving as an officer in the Royal Flying Corps, first in wireless and then in experiments in camouflage and aids to identification of enemy targets from the air. In 1918 he and Sydney were appointed official war artists, Richard recording the war from the air on the western front and then (in 1919) both brothers depicting the aerial warfare in British zones in the Middle East. Their work constitutes the most comprehensive group of paintings from the air in the Imperial War Museum.<br>
<br>Carline studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in 1921&#150;4. In 1916 his parents had moved to Hampstead. With all three artist children living there their home became what Gilbert Spencer described as &#145;a focal centre&#146;, combining hospitality with endless discussion on art and its theory. The participation in this circle of Henry Lamb, Charles Ginner, Mark Gertler, and John Nash indicates its principal characteristics&#151;which were always Carline's: the clear but careful representation of familiar motifs, freshly seen. For a few years from as early as 1914 he achieved an unusually simple and direct realism of striking psychological concentration. Elected to the London Group in 1920, he exhibited with it until the 1970s. His work was consistently admired by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36211/', "Sir Stanley Spencer")</script>, whose importance in Carline's circle was consolidated by his marriage to Hilda Carline in 1925. In 1930 a series of often vertiginous paintings of masts and rigging was the last in which, during seventeen years, Carline's work had been marked by an unusual clarity and feeling for light. Thereafter his painting was less exceptional and less continuous. Remaining a strong colourist and more interested in content than in style, he developed a controlled sensuousness of paint owing something to Gauguin and fauvism.<br>
<br>The change in Carline's art coincided approximately with the premature deaths of his remaining brothers (he had taught under Sydney's mastership at the Ruskin School of Drawing, Oxford, in 1924&#150;9), with the impact of the breakup of the Spencers' marriage, with intensification in the climate of discussion to include socio-political as well as aesthetic concerns, and with an expansion in Carline's own horizons. His art was influenced by the community-orientated figurative painting he saw in four pre-war visits to the USA, and he became a strong advocate of public mural painting in Britain. In the USA he also admired schemes to improve the place of artists in society and the work of artists' own organizations.<br>
<br>Carline's principal achievement during his last five decades was to generate contacts and creative interaction within local, national, and international communities and across boundaries of style, genre, and culture. He was motivated by strong beliefs in peace, friendship, and freedom. Tirelessly active, he was a natural organizer, finding it difficult to say no (a trait related to his instinct always to seek what was positive in the art of others rather than to criticize it). Organizations of which he was at various times chairman included the Artists' International Association (including its important refugee and regional committees); the International Artists' Association (co-founder, 1952; chairman of the UK national committee from 1959; honorary president, 1968&#150;80), an affiliated organization of UNESCO, for which as its first art counsellor he organized its first post-war international art exhibition in Paris; and the Hampstead Artists' Council (co-founder). A member of the Britain/China Friendship Association, he selected and accompanied to China exhibitions of British historical art and watercolours in 1957 and 1963.<br>
<br>Opposed to exclusiveness in selection, Carline felt that exhibitions and organizations should be broadly based and that child, na&iuml;ve, and ethnic art were as worthy of serious consideration as Western fine art. Through books and exhibitions he advanced appreciation of African art and of the picture postcard, and in his work at home and overseas under Cambridge University as an adviser on art education and examiner, he contributed significantly to the establishment of more liberal criteria for conducting art examinations and judging excellence in children's art. His <span class="italic">Draw they Must</span> (1968) is a history of four centuries of art teaching in general education in Britain and of its modern extension overseas.<br>
<br>From 1939 to 1945 Carline did important technical and liaison work on camouflage, writing the Ministry of Aircraft Production's official report on industrial and aircraft camouflage. On 13 June 1950 Carline married Nancy Mona Higgins [<i>see below</i>]; they had a son and a daughter. They continued the tradition of broad-ranging hospitality of Carline's parents. In his last decade Carline was instrumental in the creation of several exhibitions on the art of his family circle and in twentieth-century Hampstead. His <span class="italic">Stanley Spencer at War</span> (1978) is a key account of his brother-in-law as man and artist up to 1932.<br>
<br>Carline's general attitude was consistently open and progressive. He preferred art of pronounced directness, a quality seen in the clarity of his own early work and in his manner of expression as writer and speaker. A certain combination of idealism with outspokenness may account for his remaining somewhat outside the establishment of his day, despite the unfailing courtesy of his approach. In the last years of his life appreciation of his early achievement as a painter increased notably. He is represented in the Tate collection, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and other public collections. He died in Hampstead on 18 November 1980 and was buried in Sunningwell cemetery, Oxfordshire. A memorial retrospective was held at the Camden Arts Centre, London, June&#150;July 1983.<br>
<br>Carline's wife, <a name="cosubject_94305"></a><span class="headword">Nancy Mona Carline <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Higgins]</span></span>  (1909&#150;2004), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 30 November 1909 at 18 Chantrey House, Eccleston Street, Belgravia, London. She was the daughter of Douglas Stanley Higgins (1880&#150;1917), a director of the Peckham store Jones and Higgins, who was killed in the First World War, and his Australian wife, Mona Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richards. She was educated at Wycombe Abbey School and, from 1929, at the Slade School of Art, London, where she was particularly influenced by the teaching of Henry Tonks, Philip Wilson Steer, and Allan Gwynne-Jones, from whom she learned technical discipline and the value of keen observation. While working unpaid at Sadler's Wells ballet she met Vladimir Polunin, who persuaded her to return to the Slade to take his course on stage design. Polunin's teaching and work, strongly influenced by modernism, helped Nancy Higgins to move away from the subdued and highly figurative style encouraged during her first period at the Slade. In Polunin's class she also encountered a group of friends, including Rosemary Allan (who later married her former teacher Allan Gwynne-Jones) and the decorative artist Aelred Bartlett, with whom she formed a close and enduring circle. In 1934 she met Richard Carline, and became a prominent member of his Hampstead Artists' Council. One of her best-known works, <span class="italic">Supper on the Terrace</span> (1946, Tate collection), depicts Richard and other members of the Carline family (including Richard's recently deceased mother, Annie, and Nancy herself) at the family's London home, 17 Pond Street. Land and townscapes became dominant subjects of her work. Both allowed her to study important themes of light, water, architecture, and the observation of daily life. Her work was exhibited at the New English Art Club, the Royal Academy, and the Camden Arts Centre (a retrospective in 1985), and formed part of the National Theatre's exhibition of the Carlines' circle in 1997. She travelled regularly with her husband, often to Venice, and was responsible for encouraging his return to a more painterly style. She was a teacher of art during the Second World War; she and her husband worked as examiners for more than twenty-five years. After her husband's death she moved to Wallingford in Oxfordshire. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, she died at Rush Court nursing home, Wallingford Road, Shillingford, Oxfordshire, on 18 October 2004, of pneumonia. She was survived by her son and daughter.<br>
