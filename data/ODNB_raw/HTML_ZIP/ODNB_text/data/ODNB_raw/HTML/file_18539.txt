<span class="headword">Melton,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1528), <span class="occ">theologian and Catholic priest</span>, originated in the north of England and was educated at Cambridge (BA, 1476; MA, 1480; BTh, 1491; DTh, 1496), where between 1485 and 1495 he was a fellow of Michaelhouse (college records do not bear out the claim, first made in the Tudor biography of John Fisher, that he was master of Michaelhouse). At Cambridge he was a central figure in a group of reforming scholars which included John Fisher, John Constable, Ralph Collingwood, and John Colet, a group closely involved with the first stirrings of humanism in the Cambridge curriculum. Fisher treasured fond memories of Melton's lectures on Euclid. Ordained priest on 23 September 1486, Melton was instituted to the rectory of Clayworth, Nottinghamshire, on 18 May 1490, presented by George Fitzhugh, dean of Lincoln (whom he doubtless knew from Cambridge, and by whom he was appointed an executor in 1506). On 6 June 1496, by now papally dispensed for plurality, he was presented to the rectory of Aston, Yorkshire (which he resigned in 1517), by Sir John Melton, the head of the family. Archbishop Rotherham of York collated him to the prebends of Thockrington (1493&#150;4) and then Laughton-en-le-Morthen (1498&#150;1528) in York Minster, making him chancellor of York in 1496, a position he retained until his death. In this capacity he figured as executor and beneficiary of many prominent York churchmen over the following thirty years.<br>
<br>Melton retained his scholarly interests after leaving Cambridge. His impressive library, recorded in the inventory of his goods, numbered over 100 items, including many patristic, classical, and humanist texts. Particularly noteworthy are his copies of Plato and of More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span>, as well as works by such leading humanists as Pico della Mirandola, Jacques Lef&egrave;vre d'&Eacute;taples, and Erasmus (who was aware of Melton's support for his use of humanist techniques in theology). Besides these, he had an almost complete set of the works of his former pupil John Fisher against Luther and Oecolampadius. These were probably gifts from the author, who had certainly sent him a copy of an earlier work on St Mary Magdalen in 1519. He was clearly adding to his library until the onset of his final illness in 1528. Fisher praised him as an &#145;outstanding theologian&#146;, and recorded that Melton had written unpublished tracts against Luther. Melton contributed prologues to some devotional writings of John Norton, prior of the Yorkshire Charterhouse of Mount Grace, and was probably the author of a continuation of a chronicle of the archbishops of York. He did publish, with the seal of approval of his friend John Colet&#151;the inventory attached to Melton's will included &#145;A little table that was Mr Doctor Colette's&#146;&#151;<span class="italic">Sermo exhortatorius</span> (<i>c</i>.1510), an address to ordinands urging them to piety and study. Like Colet, Fisher, and other leading churchmen around the turn of the century, he was particularly attached to the cult of the name of Jesus, and was committed to the reform of the clergy through education. Melton was struck down with &#145;a palsy&#146; in May 1528, and died at Acklam, Yorkshire (a living in his gift), on 25 October 1528.<br>
