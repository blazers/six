<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Plumpton family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1165&#150;<em>c.</em>1550), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, of Plumpton near Knaresborough in the West Riding of Yorkshire, receive their first historical notice in the mid-1160s when <a name="cosubject_59059"></a><span class="headword">Sir Nigel  of Plumpton</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1165)<span class="occ"></span> is mentioned as holder of a knight's fee of the Percy barony of Spofforth. <a name="cosubject_59060"></a><span class="headword">Peter  of Plumpton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1215)<span class="occ"></span>, and heir, backed the baronial opposition to King John in the early thirteenth century and, as a result, was deprived of his estates: only following the king's death, when he swore fealty to Henry III, was his inheritance restored. Thereafter little is heard of the family until, in 1331, <a name="cosubject_59061"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [i] Plumpton</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1361)<span class="occ"></span> represented Yorkshire in parliament. <a name="cosubject_59062"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert [i] Plumpton</span>  (1341&#150;1407)<span class="occ"></span>, Sir William's son and heir, campaigned in both France and Scotland in the later fourteenth century, and certainly made a prestigious match when he secured the hand of Isabel, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24958/', "Henry Scrope, first Baron Scrope of Masham")</script>, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24964/', "Richard Scrope")</script> who became archbishop of York in 1398. In the short term, however, this marriage proved a distinctly mixed blessing for the family. Sir Robert's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_59063"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [ii] Plumpton</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1405)<span class="occ"></span>, albeit after providing generously for the succession by producing at least nine children with his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1423), daughter of John Gisburn, a citizen, merchant, and three times mayor of York, became embroiled, partly as a consequence of the Scrope connection, in a major rebellion against the first Lancastrian king, Henry IV, in 1405. Not only was his uncle Richard Scrope a prime mover in the insurrection but so was Plumpton's probable patron Henry Percy, first earl of Northumberland, and, when the rebellion failed, both the archbishop and Sir William were executed at York in June 1405. Plumpton's head was placed on the city's Micklegate as a dire warning against future acts of treason. Fortunately for the family, however, this proved the limit of Henry IV's vengeance. The king allowed Sir William's widow to retain the Plumpton manors of Grassington and Studley Roger, as well as goods to the value of &pound;40 out of her late husband's estate for the maintenance of her children, and the family was spared the disastrous political, social, and financial consequences of attainder: indeed, both Sir William's father and his eldest son rapidly obtained royal pardons. By the time Sir Robert [i] Plumpton died on 19 April 1407 his son's treason had already become no more than an uncomfortable memory.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59064"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert [ii] Plumpton</span>  (1383&#150;1421)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son and heir of Sir William [ii], secured a notably advantageous marriage (by November 1401) to Alice Foljambe, a wealthy heiress who brought with her substantial estates in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire: as a result, the Plumpton sphere of influence, hitherto largely confined to the West Riding, came also to embrace a great swathe of territory in the north midlands. A firm supporter of the Lancastrian regime and a retainer of Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland (<i>d</i>. 1455), who was restored to royal favour by Henry V between 1414 and 1416, he established a tradition of loyal service that his son and grandson were to maintain for most of the rest of the century. Percy patronage probably helps to explain his appearance on several government commissions and, more importantly from his family's point of view, his appointment in April 1414 as steward of the royal honour of Knaresborough and constable of Knaresborough Castle, posts that carried not only a generous salary but also the potential for greatly enhancing his prestige and power in the local community. Sir Robert's eminence in his home county is reflected in his return to parliament by the electors of Yorkshire in 1411 and 1416, while his new status as a prominent midlands landowner is underlined by his representation of Nottinghamshire in the Leicester parliament of 1414. Like so many knights he also joined Henry V's French campaigns. Retained for life at a fee of 20 marks per annum in October 1415 to serve the king's brother John, duke of Bedford, in peace and war, he left Southampton in April 1418 in a force commanded by Henry, Lord Fitzhugh, to take part in Henry V's conquest of Normandy; moreover, although he returned to England in 1419, he once more set sail for France in October 1420 with a retinue of eight archers, and died on 8 December 1421, probably at the siege of Meaux.<br>
<br>Sir Robert [ii] Plumpton's eldest son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22398/', "Sir William Plumpton (1404&#150;1480)")</script>, similarly served the crown in both France and England: indeed, his loyalty to the house of Lancaster, no doubt reflecting the political affiliations of his Percy patrons, caused him great trouble once Edward IV had secured the throne in 1461. Like his father he grasped every opportunity to enhance his family's social status and local influence, not least by a ruthless exploitation of the marriage market. Just as he himself had been married at an early age, to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Brian Stapleton (<i>d</i>. 1464), in order to establish a beneficial alliance between the Plumptons and their prosperous near neighbours the Stapletons of Carlton, so he treated his own children in a fashion cavalier even by fifteenth-century standards. From his first marriage he had two sons, Robert [iii] and William [iii], both of whom predeceased him and who married, successively, Elizabeth, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5663/', "Thomas Clifford, eighth Baron Clifford of Westmorland (d. 1455)")</script>. The daughters of this first, Stapleton, marriage were married into prominent local families, including the Roos of Ingmanthorpe, the Middletons of Kirkby Overblow, the Beckwiths of Clint, the Goldsboroughs, the Hamertons, and the Darells of Sessay. His only surviving son, from his second marriage, to Joan Wintringham of Knaresborough, married into the Gascoignes of Gawthorpe.<br>
<br>Despite the catastrophic results of these devious manoeuvrings in the marital stakes, which led to years of litigation and substantial losses of land, this surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22397/', "Sir Robert Plumpton (1453&#150;1525)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22398/', "Plumpton, Sir William (1404&#150;1480)")</script>], entertained similar ambitions respecting his own children. Perhaps, too, such family priorities help to explain why no later medieval Plumptons became monks or nuns, or joined the ranks of the friars, and only two enjoyed careers as secular clerics. Sir Robert [ii]'s brother George became rector of Grasmere, Westmorland, in 1439 and of Bingham, Nottinghamshire, in 1447, and retired to Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire, <i>c</i>.1451, where he was still living in 1459; and Richard Plumpton, nephew of Sir William (<i>d</i>. 1480), became a chaplain and was probably still alive in 1519. Religious bequests, including the foundation of chantries at Ripon (in 1345) and Spofforth (in 1450), suggest that spiritual considerations were by no means absent from their minds, but it was only in the sixteenth century, when the family estates had been much depleted as a result of the failure of Sir Robert Plumpton (<i>d</i>. 1525) and his son <a name="cosubject_59065"></a><span class="headword">William [iv] Plumpton</span>  (1485&#150;1547)<span class="occ"></span> to resist rival claims to their inheritance, that religion came to the fore: in the 1530s William's son, <a name="cosubject_59066"></a><span class="headword">Robert [iv] Plumpton</span>  (1516&#150;1546)<span class="occ"></span>, became a convert to protestantism, and in Elizabeth I's reign, ironically, the Plumptons became renowned in northern England for their unswerving loyalty to Roman Catholicism. By then, however, the family's political, economic, and social position had long since passed its fifteenth-century heyday.<br>
<br>Thanks to the survival of the Plumpton correspondence, a collection of about 250 family letters ranging in date from 1461 to 1552, and the coucher book, a cartulary of almost a thousand charters, deeds, and miscellaneous records (the earliest dating from the twelfth century), the Plumptons are the best-documented of all later medieval Yorkshire gentry families. Both letters and papers probably owe their survival, in the first instance, to the prolonged and acrimonious wrangles between the heirs of Sir William Plumpton (1404&#150;1480) for possession of his inheritance and, thereafter, to their transcription in the early seventeenth century [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71868/', "Babthorpe family (per. c.1501&#150;1635)")</script>]. By the time that Thomas Stapleton (1805&#150;1849) began work on the archive in the early nineteenth century, the originals had vanished. Nevertheless Stapleton, using the seventeenth-century transcripts, was able to publish a scholarly edition of the letters for the Camden Society in 1839 and, in a long introduction, to include many items from the coucher book as well. A new edition was published by the Camden Society in 1996.<br>
<br>The letters and papers make possible unusually full portrayals of Sir William Plumpton (<i>d</i>. 1480) and his son, Sir Robert Plumpton (<i>d</i>. 1525), and reveal the dynamics of gentry relationships at the time, especially evident in the litigiousness provoked by Sir William's eccentric marriage policy. Several of his legal advisers figure in the correspondence: during the 1460s Brian Roucliffe (<i>d</i>. 1494), baron of the exchequer, served Sir William in this capacity, and in the 1460s and 1470s also Godfrey Green, who was notably active in conducting legal suits and reporting on their progress. Edward Plumpton (a trained lawyer and possibly a nephew of Sir William), John Pullan, and George Emerson frequently acted in a similar vein for Sir Robert.<br>
