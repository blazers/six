<span class="headword">Lancaster,  Charles William</span>  (1820&#150;1878), <span class="occ">gun maker</span>, the eldest son of Charles Lancaster, a gun maker, of 151 New Bond Street, London, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Warrington, was born at 5 York Street, Portman Square, London, on 24 June 1820. He was educated at a private school and left at an early age to enter his father's factory, where he learned the business of a gun maker, and soon became a clever designer of models and a competent mechanic. The study of rifled projectiles and the construction of rifles was his chief pleasure, and he soon attained the highest skill as a rifle shot.<br>
<br>In 1846 Lancaster constructed a model rifle, with which he conducted successful experiments at Woolwich over distances of 1000 and 1200 yards; the duke of Wellington then ordered some similar guns for the rifle brigade at the Cape of Good Hope. During 1844 and 1845 Lancaster devoted himself to solving the problem of rifled cannon. In July 1846 he submitted to the Board of Ordnance a plan for firing smooth-sided conical projectiles from rifled cannon, and imparting the necessary rotatory motion by modifying the form of the base of the projectile. Further experiments, however, did not encourage him to go on with this scheme. In 1850 he conceived the idea of the oval bore as the proper form for all rifled arms and cannon, and his name will always be associated with this system. In order to make his invention known, he constructed full-size working models of the 68-pounder, the largest gun then in the service, for the Great Exhibition of 1851. At the request of the government these models were not exhibited, but a 68-pounder oval-bore gun, made and rifled at Birmingham, with accurately turned shells, was sent to Shoeburyness for trial. The shooting of this gun directed attention to the oval-bore system, and Lancaster assisted the war department with subsequent experiments made at Woolwich, and for some time superintended production of the guns in the Royal Arsenal. He was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 6 April 1852, and wrote a paper, in their <span class="italic">Minutes of Proceedings</span> (40.115), &#145;On the erosion of the bore in heavy guns&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1852 Lancaster experimented upon the .577 pattern Enfield rifled musket, and some carbines bored to his own specification were sent to the School of Musketry at Hythe, and found to be effective. In January 1855 the Lancaster carbine was adopted as the arm for the Royal Engineers, and was used by that corps until it was superseded by the Martini-Henry rifle in 1869. During the Crimean campaign oval-bored rifle cannon were used and did good service; they were, it is said, the first rifled guns used in active service by the army and navy. Shortly after the war heavier guns were required for armour piercing, and experiments carried out at Shoeburyness, in which Lancaster assisted, led to a complete revolution in rifled artillery. For the oval-bore system of rifling he received &pound;4000 from the government in 1867. His transactions with the War Office, however, led to disputes, and he set out his grievances in a pamphlet. Between 1852 and 1860 he had received awards totalling &pound;16,600 but considered these sums an inadequate reward for his services. Lancaster took out upwards of twenty patents, chiefly in connection with firearms, between 1850 and 1872. His last invention was a gas-check, applicable to large rifled projectiles. He travelled much in Russia, where the tsar had a special gold medal of large size struck in his honour.<br>
<br>In 1868 Lancaster married Ellen, daughter of George Edward Thorne and Ann Thorne of Old Stratford, Northamptonshire; they had two daughters. While making arrangements for retiring from business Lancaster was seized with paralysis, and died at his house, 11 Redcliffe Road, Brompton, west London, on 24 April 1878. His wife survived him.<br>
