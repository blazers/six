<span class="headword">Cleaver,  Euseby Digby</span> <span class="st"> [Eusebh D. Mac Cliabhair]</span>  (1826&#150;1894), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and promoter of the Irish language</span>, was born on 8 March 1826 at Delgany, co. Wicklow, the eldest son of William Cleaver, rector of the parish, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Digby Mackworth, third baronet, of Glen Usk, Llanhenwg Fawr, Monmouthshire. He was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5584/', "Euseby Cleaver")</script>, archbishop of Dublin, and grandnephew of William Cleaver, bishop of St Asaph. The rector and his wife, to whose memory there is a marble tablet in Christ Church, Delgany, had three sons and two daughters. Of the second son we have no account. The youngest, William Henry Cleaver, was ordained in the Church of England. Catherine Cleaver is stated to have been married to the Revd William Pennefather, but this appears to be incorrect. Her sister, Frances Augusta, became the wife of James George Scott, vicar of Bray, co. Wicklow, until disestablishment, and later archdeacon of Dublin.<br>
<br>Cleaver was privately tutored&#151;for a brief period (<i>c</i>.1840&#150;41) by James Anthony Froude, who had just come down from Oxford. In 1845 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, where his father had been educated, graduating BA with third-class honours in classics in 1849. He proceeded MA in 1857. Ordained in the Church of England in 1854, he served curacies at Ducklington in Oxfordshire and at Pimlico, London, before being presented in 1875 by the dean and chapter of St Paul's to the rectory of Landon Hills, Romford, Essex, which he retained until his retirement in 1886. He then settled in Dolgellau, Wales, having married Julian Helen, who was born in the East Indies about 1845. Her maiden name is not known. They had a son, who was five years old in 1891.<br>
<br>Cleaver, though resident in England during all his working life, identified himself with and was a munificent benefactor of every organization which had for its object the preservation of the Irish language. A founder member of the Ossianic Society in 1853, he was immediately elected to its executive council and in the following year became a vice-president. He was still a generous patron of the language forty years later, when, shortly after the foundation in Dublin of the Gaelic League on 31 July 1893, he was elected its vice-president, filling the post until his death.<br>
<br>The only thing certain about Cleaver's acquisition of the Irish language seems to be that he did not learn it in Delgany; east Wicklow had by then long ceased to be Irish-speaking. His father owned an estate in the parish of Fuerty, co. Roscommon, and Euseby by his own admission spent much of his youth in that area, which was largely Irish-speaking then. He doubtless learnt the language in the same way as did his co. Roscommon friend of later years, Douglas Hyde, also a rector's son&#151;by listening to and conversing with native Irish speakers, and by studying the grammar of William Neilson, or perhaps that of the attorney William Haliday or the lexicographer Edward O'Reilly. Hyde dedicated his own first book, <span class="italic">Leabhar sgeulaigheachta</span> (1889), to Cleaver, who had borne the cost of publication. He referred to Cleaver (as Eusebh D. Mac Cliabhair) in his account of the early Gaelic League (1937). Cleaver's own book, <span class="italic">Duanaire na Nuadh-Ghaedhilge</span>, a collection of verse new and translated, was published under his Gaelic name, reaching its third and last edition in 1891.<br>
<br>Cleaver, who in 1889 described himself as &#145;a poor man without any professional income&#146;, died at his residence, Tyn y Coed, Dolgellau, Merioneth, on 26 November 1894. He was buried in north Wales.<br>
