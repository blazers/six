<span class="headword">Pennington,  Montagu</span>  (1762&#150;1849), <span class="occ">writer and literary editor</span>, was born on 21 December 1762 at Great Mongeham, Kent, the youngest of the four sons of Thomas Pennington DD (1728&#150;1802), perpetual curate of Sutton-by-Dover and later rector of Tunstall, Kent, and Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carter (1725&#150;1798), the youngest child of Nicolas Carter DD (1688&#150;1774) and sister of the classical scholar and author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4782/', "Elizabeth Carter (1717&#150;1806)")</script>. Montagu Pennington was educated at home by his aunt Elizabeth. His baptismal name was derived from her friend the well-known bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu, whose many kindnesses to him included taking him on a four-month visit to Paris in 1776. On 23 October 1777 he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, and graduated BA in 1781 and MA in 1784.<br>
<br>Having taken holy orders Pennington was appointed in 1789 to the living of Sutton, near Dover. For nearly twenty years, beginning about 1788, he resided in Deal with his aunt in a house she later bequeathed to him. He was curate-in-charge of the adjoining parish of Walmer. Being fond of travel, he was visiting Lille in 1791 when, according to a letter from Elizabeth Carter to Elizabeth Montagu, the French Revolution drove him to the Netherlands  (<span class="italic">Letters from Mrs. Elizabeth Carter</span>, 3.331).<br>
<br>Pennington became vicar of Westwell near Ashwell in Kent in December 1803, and of Northbourne and Sholden near Deal in 1806. Elizabeth Carter died in the same year, and Pennington was executor and residuary legatee of her estate. She left him all her papers, and he prepared for press the fourth edition of her translation of Epictetus (first published 1758), to which he added her last alterations and notes (2 vols., 1807). He also published the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the life of Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, with a new edition of her poems &hellip;, to which are added, some miscellaneous essays in prose</span> (1807; 2nd edn, 2 vols., 1808). The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> praised this work, noting that Pennington &#145;has executed his task with fidelity and general propriety&#146; as well as &#145;unassuming modesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 240). He edited <span class="italic">A series of letters between Elizabeth Carter and Catherine Talbot, 1741&#150;1770, with letters from Elizabeth Carter to Mrs. Vesey</span> (2 vols., 1808; 4 vols., 1809); brought about the republication of the <span class="italic">Works of Miss Catherine Talbot, 7th ed., first published by Elizabeth Carter and now republished</span> (1809; 8th edn, 1812; 9th edn, 1819); and edited <span class="italic">Letters from Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, to Mrs. Montagu &hellip; between the years 1755 and 1800</span> (3 vols., 1817). In 1811 Pennington published <span class="italic">Redemption, or, A View of the Rise and Progress of the Christian Religion</span>. In 1814 Pennington became perpetual curate of St George's Chapel, Deal, a preferment he held until his death. He was also magistrate for Kent and the Cinque Ports. He married Mary Watts (1763&#150;1830), widow of Captain Watts RN. She died at Deal on 24 March 1830, aged sixty-seven, without any children by Pennington.<br>
<br>In Kent, Pennington's friend and neighbour Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, editor, author, and genealogist, valued him as his only literary ally among the &#145;stupid clanships&#146; of the Kentish squires. Brydges described Pennington as a good classical scholar, with a &#145;great memory&#146; and admirable judgement, but &#145;a little fastidious&#146;  (Brydges, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.46). Brydges acknowledged Pennington's &#145;continual and various aid&#146; in his ten-volume <span class="italic">Censura literaria</span>  (10.v). Pennington was probably the author of a manuscript note in the British Museum's copy of <span class="italic">Censura literaria</span>, given to him by Brydges, which states that Pennington contributed all the articles in the section called &#145;The ruminator&#146; signed &#145;&Dagger;*&Dagger;&#146;, P. M., and Londinensis. Four of the essays signed P. M. are on the theological writings of Grotius. In a separate publication of <span class="italic">The Ruminator</span> (1813) essays on Jeanne d'Arc (no. 77) and on faith and natural religion (no. 85) signed P. M. are probably also by Pennington. Certainly, Brydges again acknowledged Pennington's &#145;valuable contributions&#146; in the preface.<br>
<br>Montagu Pennington died on 15 April 1849 in Deal, where he was buried in the cemetery of St George's. Modern scholars will value him most as Elizabeth Carter's first biographer and editor, as well as for assisting women's publications, most notably those of his aunt and her correspondents.<br>
