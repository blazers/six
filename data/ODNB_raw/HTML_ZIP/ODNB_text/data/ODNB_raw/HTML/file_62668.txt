<span class="headword">Nagle <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Watson]</span>,  Florence</span>  (1894&#150;1988), <span class="occ">racehorse trainer</span>, was born at Woodleigh, Wilbraham Road, Fallowfield, Manchester, on 26 October 1894, the daughter and eldest child of William George Watson (1861&#150;1930), a merchant for Manchester goods who was created a baronet in 1912 and settled at Sulhampstead, Berkshire, and his second wife, Bessie (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of Thomas Atkinson of Workington, Cumberland. She had two brothers. On 1 July 1916 she married James Nagle, an Irishman who had returned from Toronto to serve in the King's Royal Rifle Corps during the First World War. In 1920 she began a racing partnership with him. Their first winner, trained by Harry Powney, was Fernley in the River handicap at Kempton Park. Unhappily her husband's heavy and unsuccessful gambling forced a withdrawal from turf activities. They were divorced in 1928; he died in 1933. She resumed in 1934, using an inheritance from her father to finance a stud at Sulhampstead and a small training establishment at Savile House, Newmarket, with Hugh Powney, a brother of Harry. From here emerged Sandsprite, who ran second in the 1937 Derby. During the Second World War Nagle moved her stud to Westerlands, formerly part of Lord Woolavington's stud, and purchased Rose of England, the 1930 Oaks winner, as her foundation mare.<br>
<br>In due course Nagle also began to train there&#151;and later at Petworth in Sussex&#151;and in 1947 saddled her first winner, Thoroughwort, at Lingfield. However, it was not her name that appeared as trainer on the race card, but that of her head lad. The Jockey Club in Britain had constantly refused to grant licences to women to train and hence the subterfuge of using a male nominee had to be resorted to. This prohibition on women training racehorses had more to do with authority structures in the sport than the perceived physical demands of the job. During times of emergency, such as illness and accident, many women had run their husband's stables, but racing propriety demanded that where a widow took over the licence be held by her head lad. Similarly when Norah Wilmot inherited her father's training enterprise in 1931 she was not allowed to hold the licence, this despite having been his assistant for twenty years. Not all racing authorities were as rigid. In correspondence to the Jockey Club Nagle pointed out that women had been granted training licences in the United States, Australia, Germany, Kenya, several Scandinavian countries, and Belgium, from where Madame du Bois had had entries accepted for races at Ascot. She added that the situation was hypocritical, as everyone in the industry knew that she and Norah Wilmot were trainers in all but name. Even the queen had sent the occasional horse to the Wilmot stables. She never received any statement from the Jockey Club giving reasons for their stance.<br>
<br>Finally, after two decades of fruitless campaigning, Florence Nagle took the club to court in 1966. She was seventy-one at the time with hardly a career to look forward to, but argued &#145;there was a principle involved in my fight. I am a feminist and believe that things should be decided on ability and not sex&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). The Jockey Club initially resisted, but threatened with High Court action capitulated, accepting legal advice that they had no case, as there was nothing in their rules to justify their action. They immediately said that they were prepared to grant her a licence provided that she acknowledged that it was given at the absolute and unfettered discretion of the stewards. This was no different to what was accepted by any trainer. In July they stated that they would be prepared to grant training licences to &#145;suitable women&#146; and on 3 August Florence and Norah Wilmot received their permits. Wilmot, at the age of seventy-seven, had the honour of saddling the first flat-race winner by a recognized female trainer when Scobie Breasley rode Pat to victory in the South Coast Stakes at Brighton that same day. By 1973 seventeen women held licences and between them they had trained over 300 winners since 1966.<br>
<br>Florence Nagle died at her home, Little Mayfield, Lordings Lane, West Chiltington, Pulborough, Sussex, on 30 October 1988. Her training record was moderate, though she won eight races with Elf Arrow, including the Liverpool St Leger. Nevertheless her action, as she put it, &#145;in dragging the Jockey Club into the twentieth century&#146;  (Ramsden, 117) paved the way for Jenny Pitman, Venetia Williams, Mary Reveley, and others who have competed with&#151;and beaten&#151;male trainers.<br>
