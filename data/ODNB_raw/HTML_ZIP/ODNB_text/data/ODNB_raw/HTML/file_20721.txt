<span class="headword">Oliver,  George</span>  (1781&#150;1861), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and historian</span>, was born at Newington, Surrey, on 9 February 1781, the son of James and Anne Oliver. He was educated at Sedgley Park in Staffordshire from 1789 and at Stonyhurst College from 1796 to 1802. He remained at Stonyhurst for a further five years teaching humanities. In May 1806 he was ordained priest at Durham. He did not become a Jesuit but maintained a close and cordial relationship with the order, and in 1807 was appointed by Marmaduke Stone, president of Stonyhurst, to take charge of the chapel and mission at Exeter, St Nicholas's Priory, which was formerly served by the Jesuits. As a young man he had shown interest in, and appreciation of, antiquities and had come to the notice of John Milner, vicar apostolic of the western district. At Exeter, where he was to stay for the fifty-four remaining years of his life, he found abundant scope for his antiquarian interests, as T. N. Brushfield's bibliography of his published works shows. His missionary duties, which included visiting two prisons and a hospital, left him time for research and also for public charitable activities. His services during a cholera epidemic were long remembered.<br>
<br>Oliver's main works became standard authorities. His first important work, published at Exeter (as were most of his works) in 1820, was <span class="italic">Historic Collections Relating to the Monasteries in Devon</span>, and in the following year appeared <span class="italic">The History of Exeter</span>, of which there was a second edition in 1861; an index to this was printed in 1884. In 1828 he published <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Devon, being Observations on many Churches in Devonshire</span>, which originally appeared in the <span class="italic">Exeter and Plymouth Gazette</span> with a letter on the preservation and restoration of churches. The <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Antiquities</span> was written in conjunction with the Revd John Pike Jones of North Bovey who, however, contributed only the introduction and the description of twelve churches. Between 1839 and 1842 there was published at Exeter Oliver's three-volume <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Devon, being Observations on Several Churches in Devonshire with some Memoranda for the History of Cornwall</span>. Although professedly a second edition of the former work, it possesses claims to be considered an entirely new one. The introduction to the first edition was the only contribution by Jones to be retained in the second. In 1838 he published <span class="italic">Collections illustrating the biography of the Scotch, English and Irish members of the Society of Jesus</span>. A second, limited edition was published in London in 1845. These notices appeared originally in the <span class="italic">London and Dublin Weekly Orthodox Journal</span> (vols. 2&#150;4, 1836&#150;7). The <span class="italic">Description of the Guildhall, Exeter</span>, written in conjunction with Pitman Jones, was published in 1845 and a second edition followed in 1853. In 1845 he published, again in conjunction with Pitman Jones, <span class="italic">A View of Devonshire in MDCXXX, with a Pedigree of some of its Gentry by Thomas Westcote</span>. In 1846 there appeared <span class="italic">Monasticon diocesis Exoniensis</span>, with a supplement, and an <span class="italic">Additional supplement &hellip; with a map of the diocese, deaneries, and sites of religious houses</span> was published in 1854; &#145;without these additions, the edition of Dugdale's &#145;Monasticon&#146; by [Caley] Ellis and Bandinel must be considered incomplete&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). <span class="italic">Collections illustrating the history of the Catholic religion in the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Wilts, and Gloucester</span> was published in London in 1857. Oliver presented the copyright to his friend F. C. Husenbeth, together with very copious additions and several corrections for a second edition. In 1861, the year of his death, there was published his <span class="italic">Lives of the Bishops of Exeter and a History of the Cathedral</span>.<br>
<br>Among Oliver's minor works were a translation of Father John Gerard's Latin autobiography, various articles on the Clifford family and Ugbrooke Park, and a historical novel <span class="italic">Merrye Englaunde, or, The Goldene Daies of Good Queene Besse</span> (1841). He had the principal share in preparing for publication the <span class="italic">Liber pontificalis</span> of Edmund Lacy, bishop of Exeter (1847). He wrote over a period of nine years many letters on ecclesiastical and parochial antiquities, family history, and biography, communicated under the signature of Curiosus to local newspapers, principally the <span class="italic">Exeter Flying Post</span>. He also contributed to the English Catholic periodicals of his time articles on Catholic biography, history, and antiquities.<br>
<br>&#145;Few names,&#146; declared the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in an obituary notice, &#145;will remain more pleasingly connected with the past history of Exeter than that of George Oliver.&#146; It described his publications as &#145;monuments of painstaking research and practical ability&#146;, and Brushfield wrote of &#145;our great ecclesiastical antiquary&#146;  (p. 286). Early in the twentieth century the view was expressed that some of his conclusions were no longer accepted, but that &#145;his researches considering the limited sources of knowledge available to him showed both industry and judgement&#146;  (Ward, 244). Oliver himself wrote, &#145;I have spared no time or labor [<i>sic</i>] to arrive at the Truth. But still it is but a beginning, a groundwork for something much better. The only title I can claim is that of Gleaner&#146;  (letter to Richard Norris, January 1857). Contemporaries and near contemporaries commended his scholarship and indefatigable research; later writers might qualify this view while still acknowledging the value of the immense amount of work that he accomplished.<br>
<br>In recognition of his skill as a researcher Oliver was elected an honorary member of the Historical Society of Boston on 30 March 1843, and on 15 September 1844 he was (without his knowledge, as he said) created DD by Pope Gregory XVI. In 1852 he was appointed provost of the newly erected chapter of the diocese of Plymouth. He became a trustee of the General Charities of Exeter in 1837 and was elected chairman for the year in 1842.<br>
<br>Oliver retired from active duty in 1851 but continued to live at St Nicholas's Priory, where he died on 23 March 1861. He was buried on 2 April near the high altar in the chapel in which he had served so long. A lithograph, presumably taken towards the end of his life, shows a somewhat sharp-featured face with the eyes of an enthusiast.<br>
