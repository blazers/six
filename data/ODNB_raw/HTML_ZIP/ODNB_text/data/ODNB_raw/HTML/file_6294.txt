<span class="headword">Corbet,  William</span>  (1779&#150;1842), <span class="occ">revolutionary and soldier</span>, was born at Ballythomas, co. Cork, on 17 August 1779, one of eight children in a protestant family. He was well educated by his father, who was a classical scholar and schoolmaster. He and his brother Thomas entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1794. At college he took more interest in politics than in his work, and became a member of the Society of United Irishmen and a friend of T. A. Emmet and Hamilton Rowan. He was also a leading debater in the Trinity College Historical Society, of which he was for some time secretary, and was one of the students who signed the address to Grattan in 1795 in support of Catholic emancipation. In 1798 there was an inquiry by Lord Clare, the chancellor of the university, and Patrick Duigenan into the conduct of the undergraduates; it was alleged that a treasonable song had been sung at a social meeting in Corbet's rooms. Lord Clare asserted the existence of an assassination committee, and Corbet was solemnly expelled with eighteen others, including T. A. Emmet. He subsequently became more deeply involved in revolutionary politics and fled to France, where he received a commission as captain, and was appointed to accompany the staff in Humbert's expedition to Ireland in 1798. He was on the same ship as Napper Tandy, which did not land in Ireland, and he therefore got safely back to France. He was then made an adjutant-general, and while he was at Hamburg, planning another descent upon Ireland, he was arrested there, contrary to international law, by Sir James Craufurd, the English resident, together with Napper Tandy, Blackwell, and Morres, in November 1798. After being confined for some months at Hamburg, he was sent off to England in an English frigate in September 1799. Lord Grenville did not quite know what to do with these prisoners; Bonaparte loudly denounced their arrest, and declared his intention of executing certain English prisoners at Lille if any harm came to them; and they were held in Kilmainham prison at Dublin without being brought to trial. From Kilmainham, Corbet and Blackwell made their escape in 1803, and after many risks and adventures arrived safely in Paris. Corbet gave an account of his escape in his autobiography, published in Paris in 1807, and Maria Edgeworth used the episode in her novel <span class="italic">Ormond</span> (1817).<br>
<br>Corbet's commission of 1798 was recognized, and he entered the Irish Legion, from which he was soon transferred as a captain to the 70th French regiment of the line. With the French army he served in Mass&eacute;na's expedition to Portugal, and greatly distinguished himself in the retreat from Torres Vedras and especially at the battle of Sabugal. When Marmont succeeded Mass&eacute;na he took Corbet onto his staff, and after the battle of Salamanca, Clausel made him <i>chef de bataillon</i> of the 47th regiment. He served in this capacity until 1813, when Marmont summoned him to Germany to join his staff, where he served throughout the campaigns of 1813 and 1814; he was made a commander of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. After the first abdication of Napoleon he was promoted colonel in January 1815, and acted as chief of the staff to General d'Aumont at Caen. After the second restoration he was placed on half pay, and was looked upon with disfavour by the Bourbons because of his friendship with General Foy, the leader of the opposition, whose acquaintance he had made in Spain. In 1828 he accompanied Marshal Maison in his expedition to the Morea, in the face of the opposition of Lord Stuart de Rothesay, the British ambassador at Paris. His services in Greece were extensive. After serving as governor of Navarino, Messina, and Nauplia, he relieved Argos from Colocotroni's attack. This victory was of the greatest importance; it finally overthrew the Russian party, upset the schemes of Count Capo d'Istria, and practically placed King Otho upon the throne. Corbet was rewarded by being made a knight of the order of St Louis and of the Redeemer of Greece, and was promoted general of brigade. He succeeded General Schneider as commander-in-chief of the French forces in Greece in 1831, and returned to France in 1832 with them. He was soon after promoted general of division, and commanded at Caen and Tulle. Corbet died, unmarried, at St Denis on 12 August 1842.<br>
