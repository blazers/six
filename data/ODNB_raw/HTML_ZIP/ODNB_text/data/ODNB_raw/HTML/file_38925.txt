<span class="headword">Marsham,  Robert</span>, second Baron Romney  (1712&#150;1793), <span class="occ">patron of science and philanthropist</span>, was born on 22 August 1712 at Frith Street, Soho, Westminster, and baptized at St Anne's, Soho, on 2 September, the second and only surviving son of Sir Robert Marsham, fifth baronet and from 1716 first Baron Romney (1685&#150;1724), and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shovell (1692&#150;1750), the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25470/', "Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell")</script>. The Marshams had been established in Kent from the 1630s and Robert (who succeeded to the peerage aged twelve) received an education appropriate to his social status. He entered Eton College in 1728 and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 July 1731. He graduated doctor of civil law by nobleman's privilege on 11 July 1733. He had taken his seat in the House of Lords in January 1733 and later that year travelled to Groningen, where he studied French and Italian. In 1736 Romney became engaged to Elizabeth Boteler, a fourteen-year-old Kentish heiress, but following her death in 1737 he remained a bachelor until 29 July 1742, when he married Priscilla Pym (1724&#150;1771), only child of Charles Pym of St Kitts in the West Indies, who had sent her to be educated at West Farleigh, near the Marsham family seat of The Mote at Maidstone in Kent. The Romneys had ten children. The eldest, Robert Pym Marsham, was born in 1743 and died unmarried in 1762, but the second, Charles Marsham (1744&#150;1811), succeeded his father as third baron and was created earl of Romney in 1801. The tenth child, Charlotte, was born in 1761 and died on 16 January 1794, some two months after her father.<br>
<br>Politically independent, Romney disliked the luxury and formality of court life and &#145;Great Men's Tables&#146;  (letter to duke of Leeds, 8 Sept 1737, BL Add. MS 28051, fol. 316). He shared this attitude together with an interest in philanthropy and practical science with his relative the natural philosopher and clergyman Stephen Hales, one of whose ventilating machines was installed at St George's Hospital, where Romney was a governor. His sister Elizabeth's husband, Jacob Bouverie, first Viscount Folkestone, was also a benefactor of the hospital, and well known to Hales. Romney and Folkestone concocted a scheme to encourage arts, manufactures, and commerce by means of a public subscription, similar to that proposed by William Shipley, a drawing master. In 1753 Hales gave Shipley an introduction to Romney, who agreed to waive his and Folkestone's scheme and to draft and sign a declaration authorizing Shipley to canvass for subscriptions from the nobility and gentry to &#145;promote and establish&#146; a society of arts.<br>
<br>Romney was one of the nucleus of eleven foundation members who met at Rawthmell's Coffee House to establish a society for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and commerce [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94594', "Founders of the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce")</script>]. A year later, when officers were chosen, he was elected &#145;First Vice-President&#146; and in 1758 awarded the society's medal in gold &#145;for Eminent Services&#146;. He succeeded Lord Folkestone as president on the latter's death in 1761, gaining a majority of 222 votes to two over his opponents, the earl of Lichfield and Lord Willoughby. Romney was re-elected each year until his death in 1793. Both as vice-president and as president Romney's chief responsibility was to take the chair at the sometimes turbulent meetings of the society. At these he displayed what Robert Dossie called a &#145;benign temper, unbiased judgement and patient attention&#146;  (Dossie, 2.vii). He was regular in attendance until old age and illness prevented it and from the earliest years he gave support to the institution in other ways. In 1754 he and Lord Folkestone offered to subsidize the society's premiums and in 1763 he contributed &pound;100 to the society's building fund. In 1769 he sat for his portrait by Joshua Reynolds at the unanimous request of the membership and in the same year stood aloof from John Stewart's discreditable campaign to gain the secretaryship by packing the society with his allies, chiefly Rockingham whigs motivated by party interest. In 1778 he presented George III with a specially bound copy of the <span class="italic">Register of Premiums</span>.<br>
<br>In the wake of the foundation of the Society of Arts, Romney lent his name and presence to other philanthropic projects. He was the first chairman of the Marine Society, established in 1756 by the philanthropist Jonas Hanway to encourage poor men and boys to join the navy by offering food and clothing and some educational preparation. He held the office until 1772 when he was elected president under the provisions of the royal charter granted in that year. He remained president until his death. The Magdalen Society, of which Romney became first vice-president in 1758, grew out of a Society of Arts scheme to assist repentant prostitutes. He was also vice-president of the Troop Society, set up for the relief of the dependants of those who were killed or were incapacitated in the battles of Minden and Quebec in 1759. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1757 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1762. In 1772 he was chosen president of the Society for the Discharge of Persons Imprisoned for Small Debts. In 1778 he wrote and spoke in favour of the earl of Chatham's plan to conciliate the North American colonies, yet he remained well regarded by the king and shared the sovereign's interest in agricultural improvements. In 1787 he became president of the Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge in the County of Kent, to which the leading agriculturist Arthur Young belonged.<br>
<br>Romney's final illness and the cause of his death, which took place at The Mote, Maidstone, Kent, on 16 November 1793, were not reported in the newspapers, but he had been unwell since 1788 when he had gone to Bath in the hope of a cure. He was buried on 26 November 1793 at All Saints' Church, Maidstone. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Maidstone Journal</span> praised his political independence, his strict religious observances &#145;from Youth to extreme age&#146;, and, most revealingly, the &#145;generous, mild and amiable&#146; character of his private life  (<span class="italic">Maidstone Journal</span>, 19 November 1793). Although to some extent all were standard tropes of the nobleman's obituary, Romney's philanthropic achievements and the regard in which he was held by George III suggested they had some substance. Of the philanthropic organizations founded or supported by Romney, the Society of Arts, the Magdalen Society (as the Magdalen Trust), the Marine Society, and the Society for the Discharge of Persons Imprisoned for Small Debts (as the Debtors' Relief Fund) all endured into the twenty-first century.<br>
