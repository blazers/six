<span class="headword">Walker,  Alice</span>  (1900&#150;1982), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 8 December 1900 at 97 Dover Street, Crumpsall, Manchester, the daughter of George Edward Walker, then of independent means and later a solicitor, and Mary Alice Walker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cort. From 1912 she attended Blackburn High School for Girls and passed the University of London matriculation examination in 1919. She took her BA with first-class honours from Royal Holloway College in 1923, receiving the George Smith studentship for graduate studies, and in May 1926 she was passed as PhD in the faculty of arts with a thesis on the works of Thomas Lodge (1558?&#150;1625). In October she entered Girton College, Cambridge, on a Jex-Blake scholarship, intending to work towards a four-volume edition of Lodge's works, and was awarded a University of London postgraduate scholarship for travel and research during 1927&#150;8. After research at Coimbra, Lisbon, Madrid, and Rome, she received a three-year appointment as assistant lecturer in English at Royal Holloway College (1928&#150;31). Thenceforth, until her return to the college in 1939 as librarian, she lived with friends or with her parents at 49 Denmark Road, Churchtown, Southport Lancashire.<br>
<br>Walker published her first article in 1932 in the <span class="italic">Review of English Studies</span> and this was followed by some forty reviews in this publication, founded and then edited by R. B. McKerrow. Her first book, <span class="italic">The Life of Thomas Lodge</span> (1933), also appeared at this time, published by Sidgwick and Jackson, the firm of which McKerrow was a director. Her second book (1934) was an edition of Puttenham's <span class="italic">Arte of English Poesie</span>, published collaboratively with Gladys Doidge Willock, her long-standing friend, head of the English department and later professor at Royal Holloway College. In the same year she published her first article on Shakespeare and was employed by McKerrow to assist with the <span class="roman">Oxford Old-Spelling Shakespeare</span> for the Clarendon Press, which had been delayed by his illness. McKerrow accounted her &#145;the ideal person to help me with the job&#146;  (Oxford University Press Archives, CP/ED/000018, 2/5/36), considering her accurate beyond his own standards. On McKerrow's death in 1940 two volumes of Shakespeare's early plays were close to publication and work on another was advanced. Although the press was disposed to ask Walker to carry on the edition, it appears to have been suspended during the Second World War and abandoned in 1948.<br>
<br>In 1939, already with &#145;a wide reputation for bibliographical scholarship&#146;  (<span class="italic">College Letter</span>, 1940, 14), Walker was appointed librarian at Royal Holloway College and was quickly involved in the fortunes of Janet R. Bacon (principal from 1935 to 1944) who appointed her principal's secretary and registrar in 1941. When Bacon resigned because of ill health in 1944, Walker also resigned and retired with her friend to Welcombe, near Bideford, Devon; they later lived in Bude, Cornwall, and in Oxford.<br>
<br>During the war Walker had published only the &#145;Summary of periodical literature&#146; in the <span class="italic">Review of English Studies</span>. After six years' private study intended to complete McKerrow's edition, in 1950 she began to publish a remarkable series of articles on Shakespeare's text, and in 1952 to review <span class="roman">Arden</span> and <span class="roman">New Variorum</span> editions of Shakespeare's works and Malone Society facsimiles for the <span class="italic">Review</span>. Her next book, <span class="italic">Textual Problems of the First Folio</span> (1953, in J. Dover Wilson's <span class="roman">Shakespeare Problems</span> series), for which she was awarded the 1954 British Academy's Rose Mary Crawshay prize, preceded five successive textual articles in Fredson Bowers's <span class="italic">Studies in Bibliography</span>. These works revealed her as the most acute and challenging textual critic of the decade, her work innovatively conspicuous for the attention given to the influence of compositors on the transmission of texts.<br>
<br>After publishing <span class="italic">Othello</span> and <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span> in Dover Wilson's new <span class="roman">Cambridge Shakespeare</span> (both 1957), Walker was urged to apply for the Oxford readership in textual criticism vacated by Herbert Davis, though she expected that she was &#145;much too old to be considered unless a stop-gap is wanted&#146;  (A. Walker to D. Davin, November 1959). Nevertheless, the appointment would facilitate her work on the <span class="roman">Oxford Old-Spelling</span> edition which had been revived in 1952, albeit on a different plan, with the appointment of G. I. Duthie as editor; applying for the readership in December 1959, Walker listed herself as Duthie's co-editor. She was appointed reader for seven years with effect from Michaelmas term 1960, and was elected professorial fellow of St Hilda's College in November 1962. The Clarendon Press announced <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> in 1964 as the first volume of the Oxford edition but only proofs survive. In 1965, when applying for sabbatical leave, she noted that her increasing teaching load had put her own work (the edition) &#145;shockingly in arrears&#146;  (University of Oxford Archives FA 9/2/910; board minutes DL 19.1.65). Following her appointment, other than her British Academy annual Shakespeare lecture (1960), two short reviews, and a quatercentenary article in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> (1964), she did not publish until the year of her death. She retired in September 1968, having spent much of Michaelmas term 1967 and Hilary term 1968 in Bude recovering from a broken pelvis. She was created reader emeritus in 1972 and died unmarried, of cancer of the liver, on 14 October 1982 at Plymouth Hospital. Her last article appeared posthumously in the <span class="italic">Review of English Studies</span>.<br>
<br>Described in 1997 as &#145;the most important female editor in the twentieth century&#146;  (Thompson, 85), Walker never managed to publish the editions which her long involvement with Shakespeare promised. Her dominant interest during the last forty years of her life lay in the textual problems which must be resolved before a work can be edited. Her most notable contribution was to identify the effects of compositors&#151;the neglected agents of textual transmission&#151;and to indicate how their influence could be studied. She was the senior member of the triumvirate including Fredson Bowers and Charlton Hinman which made compositorial analysis the distinctive editorial tool of the second half of the twentieth century. She was acute in criticism, direct and trenchant in conversation, and, at Oxford, solicitous for the well-being of her students.<br>
