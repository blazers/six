<span class="headword">Berkeley,  Hubert John Aloysius</span>  (1864&#150;1942), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born on 25 June 1864 at Overbury, Worcestershire, the fourth of six sons of Robert Berkeley (1823&#150;1897), landowner, of Spetchley Park, Worcestershire, and his wife, Lady Mary Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Browne (<i>d</i>. 1924), younger daughter of Thomas Browne, third earl of Kenmare. After training on HMS <i>Conway</i> he became a midshipman in the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>In 1886 Berkeley joined the service of the Malay state of Perak and from 1904 to 1926 (with an interval of military service in 1914&#150;18) he was district officer of Upper Perak, which he administered in the fashion of a Malay chief and with little regard for higher authority. This inaccessible district had only a sparse Malay population. However, when Berkeley took charge in 1904 there were surface mines at Klian Intan just over the border in the state of Rahman, which was under Siamese control. The headwaters of the Perak river in Rahman were exposed to the risk of pollution by sludge discharged from the mines, which had recently been expanded by the hydraulicing operations of two European companies. Berkeley urged that this danger to Malay agricultural areas lower down the Perak river be contained. His local knowledge played an important part in boundary negotiations in 1909, and the vulnerable Perak river catchment area was transferred from Rahman to Perak. Thereafter, throughout his long tenure in Upper Perak, Berkeley encouraged only traditional Malay settlement, mainly through irrigation schemes. He grew his own food and travelled on horse or elephant, abominating motor cars, roads, newspapers, moneylenders, and lawyers.<br>
<br>Berkeley was a commanding figure who habitually wore a bush jacket and shorts surmounted by a khaki helmet or by a straw boater with a ribbon inscribed HMS <i>Malaya</i>. His hospitality to chosen friends and his annual journey of inspection to Belum at the extremity of his district were elaborately organized. He claimed to know the history of every Malay village and to be personally acquainted with its headman, and his unceremonious and direct style of administration was popular with them. During the First World War he served as a captain in the Worcestershire Regiment, though to his disgust he was employed mainly in the supply of cavalry remounts in Palestine and the Sudan. He was appointed a companion of the Imperial Service Order in 1921.<br>
<br>His successor in Upper Perak noted that Berkeley &#145;had woven a legend about himself&#146; through the dissemination of anecdotes of his own eccentricity and defiance of the state government  (Morkill, 27). In the best-known of these episodes he reported that a non-existent bridge was down or that a large tree had fallen (it had been felled) across the only road, and thus prevented his superiors from paying their threatened visits of inspection. Summoned in 1913 to the state capital for the celebration of the GCVO conferred on the sultan of Perak he sent word to the harassed organizer that he would bring 47 elephants, 25 buffaloes, 87 schoolboys, 65 actors, 24 cooks, and 100 general attendants.<br>
<br>Berkeley did a great deal for the welfare of the Malays of the district, but his opposition to change, although shared by some of his colleagues, was not entirely in tune with contemporary Malay aspirations. For example Sultan Idris of Perak held his state council spellbound with his expertise on Malay custom, but doubted the wisdom of the Malay reservations legislation of 1913 that aimed to put a ring fence round areas of Malay settlement throughout the Federated Malay States.<br>
<br>The significance of Berkeley lay not in what he did but in his image among his colleagues. Somerset Maugham, who had visited Malaya in Berkeley's time in search of material for his short stories, observed of the Europeans that &#145;the vast majority &hellip; were ordinary people ordinarily satisfied with their station in life&#146;, and so he wrote of the exceptions only, such as Berkeley  (Maugham, 8). A fellow administrator agreed with George Orwell (in Burma) that in Malaya &#145;most of us belonged to the upper lower (or lower upper) middle class&#146;  (Purcell, 291). Berkeley's colleagues, elevated <i>ex officio</i> to higher status in colonial society, but enmeshed in a tight bureaucracy, were fascinated by Berkeley as a flamboyant aristocrat who resisted change among the Malay community that would eventually undermine the basis of colonial rule, and who used the remoteness of Upper Perak and his self-confidence to defy the powers that be. They admired (or thought they did) this model of a nonconformity they themselves did not practise.<br>
<br>On retiring from Malaya, Berkeley farmed at Clink Gate Farm, an inherited property near Droitwich in Worcestershire. He became chairman of the local magistrates' bench and rode to hounds twice a week, going about in a yellow four-wheeled dogcart drawn by a pair of horses. On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 he joined the local Home Guard. He died at Clink Gate Farm of a cerebral haemorrhage on 27 April 1942, lamenting the changes in Malaya since his time and its fall to the Japanese. He was unmarried.<br>
