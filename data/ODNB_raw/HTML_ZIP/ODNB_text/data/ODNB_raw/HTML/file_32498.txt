<span class="headword">Collie,  John Norman</span>  (1859&#150;1942), <span class="occ">organic chemist and mountaineer</span>, was born at Ferns Cottage, Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on 10 September 1859, the second son of John Collie, a businessman, and his wife, Selina Mary (<i>d</i>. 1883), daughter of Henry Winkworth, a silk merchant, and sister of Catherine Winkworth and Susanna Winkworth. Collie was educated at Charterhouse (1873&#150;5) and Clifton College (1875&#150;7). He studied chemistry under Edmund Albert Letts (1852&#150;1918) at University College, Bristol (1877&#150;9), where he obtained a chemical scholarship, and at Queen's College, Belfast (1879&#150;83). He decided to pursue a career of teaching and research in chemistry, and became assistant to Letts at Queen's College from 1880 to 1883. In 1883 he went to work with Johannes Wislicenus at W&uuml;rzburg University, obtaining the degree of PhD the following year. On his return he became science lecturer at the Ladies' College, Cheltenham (1885&#150;7), and then went on to be: assistant to William Ramsay at University College, London (1887&#150;96); professor of chemistry at the College of the Pharmaceutical Society, London (1896&#150;1902); and professor of organic chemistry in the University of London at University College (1902&#150;28). After his retirement he was elected an honorary fellow and continued scientific work at University College until 1933.<br>
<br>Collie was a skilful experimenter who could construct his own apparatus, including &#145;vacuum&#146; tubes in which gases could be exposed to electrical discharges. He collaborated with Ramsay in much work on argon and helium, and he constructed the first neon lamp. Independently of each other, Collie and Hubert Sutton Patterson detected the presence of neon in hydrogen after the passage of an electrical discharge through the latter at low pressure. This apparent &#145;transmutation&#146; could not be repeated by other skilled investigators, and must have been due to the leakage of minute quantities of air. Collie was responsible in 1896 for the first photograph taken by means of X-rays of a metal object in the human body. His principal scientific activity was in the field of organic chemistry, where he worked, <i>inter alia</i>, on phosphonium compounds and phosphines, and on dehydracetic acid, its constitution, reactions, salts, and derivatives. Also of interest was his work on the derivation in practice and theory of many natural systems from the polyacetic acids, and the construction of a possible general relation between all these systems and the carbohydrates. This work was published mainly in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span> and the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> over a period of nearly fifty years.<br>
<br>Collie was elected FRS in 1896 and received the honorary degrees of LLD from the universities of Glasgow and St Andrews, and DSc from Belfast and Liverpool. Besides his eminence as a scientist, he acquired great fame as a climber and explorer of mountains. Beginning with the Cuillin peaks in Skye, where he discovered many new climbs, he climbed with notable success in the Alps, and went in 1895 with A. F. Mummery to the Himalayas, where they attempted the ascent of Nanga Parbat; during this expedition Mummery was killed, an episode which deeply affected Collie. The latter also climbed in the Lofoten islands off the Norwegian coast, but his greatest work was done in his pioneering climbing, mapping, and surveying in the Canadian Rockies. His books, <span class="italic">Climbing on the Himalaya and other Mountain Ranges</span> (1902) and (with Hugh E. M. Stutfield) <span class="italic">Climbs and Exploration in the Canadian Rockies</span> (1903), are famous records. In Britain, Collie climbed particularly in Skye, Snowdon, and the Lake District. He was elected president of the Alpine Club in 1920 and was an honorary member of many other climbing clubs.<br>
<br>Collie was also a connoisseur of many fine things, including cigars and French wines, and a great collector, of minerals, books, and pictures, and particularly of antique objects of Japanese and Chinese art. He made an investigation of certain coloured glazes on Chinese porcelain, published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Oriental Ceramic Society</span> (1921&#150;2).<br>
<br>Glen Brittle House and the Sligachan Inn became Collie's summer homes on Skye, where he spent his time fishing, shooting, and climbing. He died, unmarried, at Sligachan on 1 November 1942, having suffered complications from neuritis, lumbago, and sciatica. He was buried beside his close friend and climbing companion, John Mackenzie, in the churchyard at Struan on the shore of Loch Harport. To those who knew him he was a great host and a faithful friend.<br>
