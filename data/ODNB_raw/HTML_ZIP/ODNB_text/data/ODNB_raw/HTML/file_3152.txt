<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyse,  Samuel</span>  (1702/3?&#150;1749), <span class="occ">poet</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3151/', "Joseph Boyse (1660&#150;1728)")</script>, a dissenting minister, and his wife, Rachel (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ibbetson), was born in Dublin and educated at a private school there. He was said to have been eighteen when he entered Glasgow University, where he was an undergraduate by February 1721, the year in which his elegy on the theologian John Anderson (1668&#150;1721) was published. His father probably intended him for the Presbyterian ministry, but, under-age, he married a tradesman's daughter, Emilia Atchenson, and abandoned his studies. He returned to Dublin with his wife and her sister, where they sponged on Joseph until his death in November 1728. Samuel's young daughter died in 1726 and was mourned in his verse. He wrote a letter on liberty in James Arbuckle's <span class="italic">Dublin Weekly Journal</span> (11 February 1727).<br>
<br>Boyse went to Edinburgh, where his collection <span class="italic">Translations and Poems</span> (1731), dedicated to the countess of Eglinton, attracted over 250 subscribers. Some poems were &#145;sacred to conjugal love&#146; and addressed to his wife in Ireland, though it was said that Boyse knew she was having affairs. Boyse found patrons among members of the Scottish nobility to whom he dedicated several separately published poems, but he was unresponsive to their offers of help. Shiels said that the duchess of Gordon gave Boyse an introduction for a post in the customs, but the day on which he should have presented himself was stormy, so he chose to lose the post rather than face the rain. This may be an embellishment of the fact that Boyse refused an offered post in the excise because its duties required &#145;a Strength and Application beyond my Capacity&#146; and because he believed his education fitted him for more respectable callings, such as nobleman's secretary or librarian, or grand-tour tutor  (Boyse to Sir John Clerk, 24 May 1733).<br>
<br>Debts drove Boyse from Edinburgh after 1734. He went to London, but failed to take advantage of introductions to influential men such as Alexander Pope and the future Lord Mansfield. Boyse's wife, with at least one child, had rejoined him, though the pair followed irregular courses to the extent that both were poxed by different partners. Begging letters, including many to eminent dissenters who were friends and admirers of Boyse's father, together with verse writing, much of it for magazines, provided the family's uncertain income. For instance: in 1737 <span class="italic">The Olive, an Heroic Ode</span> earned Boyse 10 guineas from its dedicatee, Sir Robert Walpole; in 1738 Robert Dodsley gave him only 2 guineas for translations from Voltaire; and in 1739 Boyse's follow-up begging letter to Sir Hans Sloane asked him to replace the bad shilling he had given to Mrs Boyse the night before. Shiels saw Boyse when he had pawned his clothes and<blockquote>sat up in bed with the blanket wrapt about him, through which he had cut a hole large enough to admit his arm, and placing the paper upon his knee, scribbled in the best manner he could the verses he was obliged to make. (Shiels, 5.169)</blockquote>At this time, though, Boyse wrote his best work. His <span class="italic">Deity</span> (1739), a long poem in heroic couplets on the attributes of God, shows a firm religious conviction and an intellectual strength quite out of keeping with the disorder of its author's life.<br>
<br>Boyse published a second collection, <span class="italic">Translations and Poems</span> (1738) and continued as a hack. Throughout the summer of 1740 he was employed by Edward Cave in French translation, which his friend Samuel Johnson said he did well; in the following winter he could find only the slavish labour of index making. Then he modernized two of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> for 3<i>d</i>. a line in George Ogle's edition (1741). Most of Boyse's poems appeared fugitively in journals, but <span class="italic">The Praise of Peace</span>, translated from the Dutch (1742), and <span class="italic">Albion's Triumph</span>, on the victory at Dettingen (1743), achieved separate publication. In July 1742, arrested for debt, he wrote a desperate letter to Cave and obtained half a guinea on account for <span class="italic">The Praise of Peace</span> and &#145;The Triumphs of Nature&#146; (on Stowe gardens). Cave paid Boyse by the hundred lines, later requiring him to produce what he called the &#145;long hundred&#146;; Boyse signed his work in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> &#145;Y&#146; or Alcaeus. Three begging letters of 1744 are printed in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> (March 1986, 78&#150;80). This was the pattern of his entire literary life. He squandered what little he had, so was still obliged to pawn his clothes from time to time, but was ingenious enough to invent a paper collar and cuffs to conceal his lack of a shirt in public. Johnson once collected money to redeem Boyse's clothes, which two days later were pawned again. &#145;The sum (said Johnson) was collected by sixpences, at a time when to me sixpence was a serious consideration&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 4.407n.).<br>
<br>Boyse had some connection with Reading, Berkshire. His <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works &hellip; for the Amusement of the Fair Sex</span> was published there in 1740, and one of its light amatory poems was addressed to &#145;The Reading Muses&#146;. Emilia Boyse died in Reading some time between 1745 and June 1747, and was buried at the expense of the parish. Her widower, unable to afford mourning clothes, tied half a yard of black ribbon round the neck of the lap-dog that he carried about whenever he affected to be a man of fashion. He took to drink, but managed to compile an <span class="italic">Historical Review</span> of the period 1739 to 1745 and an <span class="italic">Impartial History</span> of the Jacobite rising of 1745 (published in Reading, 1747&#150;8, by David Henry, Cave's brother-in-law). For writing and proof-correcting these substantial, rushed works he was paid half a guinea a week. On the title pages he is called &#145;MA&#146;, but there is no evidence that he ever took a degree.<br>
<br>Boyse returned to London and, some two years after the death of Emilia, married again. His second wife, a cutler's widow, originally from Dublin, was uneducated, but &#145;well enough adapted to his taste&#146;  (Shiels, 5.172), and it seems that she induced him to live more regularly and to dress decently. He now expressed remorse for his former life in a poem called &#145;The Recantation&#146;. After a lingering phthisis, resulting from injuries sustained either from being run over by a coach when drunk or from being assaulted in the street by two or three soldiers, he died in lodgings near Shoe Lane, off Fleet Street, in May 1749. His friend Francis Stewart, Johnson's amanuensis, tried to collect money for a decent funeral, but failed because potential donors had all been sponged upon so often by Boyse during life; so he was buried as a pauper, only with the distinction that the burial service was separately performed over his corpse.<br>
<br>Boyse's last works were <span class="italic">A Demonstration of the Existence of God</span> (1749), translated from F&eacute;nelon, and a classical handbook, <span class="italic">The New Pantheon, or, Fabulous History of the Heathen Gods</span>, published posthumously in 1753 and often reprinted in a version revised and corrected by William Cooke (<i>d</i>. 1780). Boyse's <span class="italic">Deity</span> received wide publicity when Henry Fielding (who had commended it in <span class="italic">The Champion</span>, 12 February 1740) praised it again in the introduction to book 7 of <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (February 1749), prompting a new edition of the poem a month later. Boyse's friend, Dr William Cuming of Dorchester, said that he &#145;was of a middle size, of a thin habit, slovenly in his dress, which was increased by his necessities, very near-sighted, and his hearing imperfect&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Select Collection</span>, 6.348). Shiels testifies that, besides his literary attainments, Boyse had a taste for painting and for music, and an extensive knowledge of heraldry  (Shiels, 5.174).<br>
