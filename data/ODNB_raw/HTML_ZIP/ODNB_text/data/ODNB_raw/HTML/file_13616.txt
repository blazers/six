<span class="headword">Holtby,  Richard</span>  (1552&#150;1640), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born at Fryton, Yorkshire, the second son of Lancelot Holtby of Fryton and Ellen Butler of Nunnington in Ryedale. He went to the University of Cambridge, studying first at Christ's College and then at Gonville and Caius. In 1573 he moved on to Oxford where he studied at Hart Hall, whose principal favoured the old religion. Alexander Briant, the future Jesuit, was there at the time. His next stop was the English College in Douai, where he arrived in August 1577. There he was received into the Roman Catholic church. He was ordained a priest at nearby Cambrai on 29 March 1578. The next year he went on the English mission and he laboured with good results in his home county. In 1581 Edmund Campion paid him a visit. It was Holtby who provided Campion with a suitable place where he could write his <span class="italic">Decem rationes</span>.<br>
<br>The following year Holtby felt that despite his many years of schooling he needed more expertise in theological controversy. He thought that joining the Jesuits would solve this problem. After Lent 1582 he travelled on horseback to London to find the Jesuit superior. When his search was fruitless he sold his horse and bought a passage to the continent. He was admitted to the Society of Jesus in Verdun on 5 October 1582. After finishing his noviciate he was sent to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson to study theology and serve as superior of the Scots College there. He also worked with victims of the plague. He was sent to England in late 1588 or early 1589. By January 1590 he was back in the north, and from that time until his death in 1640 he was one of the bulwarks of the English Catholic church. Holtby was then in his late thirties and a brilliant apostolic career lay ahead of him. He never used his extra years of training to write books of controversial theology, but he was an enthusiastic admirer of the controversial writings of Robert Persons as was apparent from the annual report he sent to Rome in 1609.<br>
<br>Holtby worked closely both with the secular clergy and with the lay Catholics of northern England. With their help he was able to find places where new priests for the English mission could disembark on the Tyne. He also supplied many of these new recruits with horses, cash, and a place to stay. On one occasion he met Henry Garnet, the superior of the mission, and Nicholas Owen in order to devise a way to make better priest's holes. Holtby himself was an excellent carpenter and fashioned many hiding places. He also used a number of aliases to avoid arrest, including Andrew Ducket, Robert North, and Richard Fetherston.<br>
<br>In 1603 Holtby professed the four Jesuit vows. After the arrest of Henry Garnet in 1604 he succeeded him as superior of the Jesuits on the English mission, and when Garnet was executed in 1606 Holtby was named his successor. He held the office until he was succeeded in 1609 by Robert Jones. A government spy described Holtby as &#145;a little man with a reddish beard&#146;, and he has the reputation for having been one of the toughest missionaries in England. He once escaped some would-be captors by lying quietly in the grass for two days and nights. Holtby also appreciated the key role that Catholic women played in evangelization. He was a close friend of Dorothy Lawson, whose house at St Anthony's near Newcastle was built &#145;as a centre for the Jesuits in the far north-east&#146;  (Bossy, 157). It all began when Lawson, whose husband spent most of his time in London, asked Holtby to give her and her maid an eight-day retreat. Holtby was also a spiritual adviser of Mary Ward, who later founded a religious order for women.<br>
<br>One of Holtby's hobbies was needlework. He made not only vestments and altar cloths, but jerkins and everyday wear. He also wrote two long memoranda concerning the persecution of Roman Catholics in the north of England. He was one of the few priests on the English mission in the early seventeenth century who died in his bed. Not only did he escape the death penalty, he was never gaoled. He died in the Durham district between 15 and 25 May 1640.<br>
