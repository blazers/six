<span class="headword">Ogden,  Jonathan Robert</span>  (1806&#150;1882), <span class="occ">composer</span>, son of Robert Ogden (<i>d</i>. 1816), merchant, was born at Leeds on 13 June 1806 and was educated there, partly under Joseph Hutton, minister of Mill Hill Unitarian Chapel. He became a Unitarian, though his parents were members of the Church of England. For a short time he was placed in the office of Thomas Bolton, a sometime partner of his father's, at Liverpool, but he had no taste for mercantile life, and showed an early talent for music. When very young he played the cello at a concert, but his instrument was the piano. To forward his musical education, his mother (whose maiden name was Glover) moved to London. Here Ogden became a pupil of Ignaz Moscheles, and later of Augustus Kollman. He studied for a year at Paris under Johann Peter Pixis, and for three years at Munich under Joseph Hartmann Stuntz; in 1827 he visited Vienna. In 1834 he married Thomas Bolton's daughter, Frances, after which he settled in the Lake District at Lakefield, Sawrey, near Hawkshead, where he lived the life of a country gentleman.<br>
<br>James Martineau, when compiling his <span class="italic">Hymns for the Christian Church and Home</span> (1840), invited Ogden to supply tunes of unusual metre. The result was Ogden's <span class="italic">Holy Songs and Musical Prayers</span> (1842). A feature of the volume that evoked criticism was the adaptation as hymn tunes of pieces by Beethoven and others. From the seventh and much enlarged edition (1872) the adaptations were omitted. The style of Ogden's original music was not ecclesiastical, nor were his compositions well adapted for ordinary congregational use, but their spirit was rightly indicated in the title of the volume.<br>
<br>Ogden died at Lakefield on 26 March 1882, and was buried in Hawkshead churchyard. He was survived by his wife and a granddaughter.<br>
