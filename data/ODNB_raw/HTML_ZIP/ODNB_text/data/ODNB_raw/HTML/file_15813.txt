<span class="headword">Kyan,  John Howard</span>  (1774&#150;1850), <span class="occ">inventor of kyanizing</span>, was born on 27 November 1774 in Dublin, the elder of two sons (there were also five daughters) of John Howard Kyan (1743&#150;1801) of Mount Howard, Ballymurtagh, in co. Wicklow, and his wife, Phillis (<i>d</i>. 1808), daughter of Thomas Sutton, count of Clonard. The nationalist Esmond Kyan (1750&#150;1798) was his uncle. His father was the owner of valuable copper mines in co. Wicklow, and for some time at the end of the eighteenth century worked them himself. Kyan was educated to take part in the management of the mines, but soon after he entered the concern its fortunes declined, and in 1804 his father died almost penniless. In the same year, Kyan married his cousin Ellen Kyan, daughter of James Kyan of Carlow. They had three sons, the eldest of whom was the Revd William Edward Kyan of Ballymurtagh, and seven daughters. For a time Kyan was employed at a vinegar works at Newcastle upon Tyne, but subsequently moved to London, to Greaves's vinegar brewery in Old Street Road.<br>
<br>The decay of the timber supports in his father's copper mines had already directed Kyan's attention to the question of preserving vegetable substances, in particular timber, and as early as 1812 he began experiments with a view to discovering a method of preventing the decay. Eventually he found that bichloride of mercury (or corrosive sublimate) gave the best results, having first applied it to timber in 1825. Without revealing the nature of the process, he submitted a block of oak impregnated with that substance to the Admiralty in 1828 and it was placed in a so-called &#145;fungus pit&#146; at Woolwich, where it remained for three years exposed to all the conditions favourable to decay. When taken out in 1831, it was found to be perfectly sound, and after further trials it still remained unaffected. Kyan patented his discovery in 1832 (nos. 6253 and 6309), extending the application of the invention to the preservation of such materials as paper, canvas, cloth, and cordage. A further patent was granted in 1836 (no. 7001). The preservative action of a solution of bichloride of mercury was previously well known, and Kyan's process merely consisted in the submersion of timber or other materials in a tank containing a solution of corrosive sublimate in water (1 lb bichloride of mercury to 5 gallons of water). Kyan maintained that permanent chemical combination took place between the mercurial salt and the woody fibre, but this was contested. The process attracted great attention and Michael Faraday chose it as the subject of his inaugural lecture at the Royal Institution on 22 February 1833, on his appointment as Fullerian professor of chemistry.<br>
<br>In 1835 the Admiralty published the report of a committee appointed by the board to inquire into the efficacy of the process and the effect if any on health from the use of a mercury compound. Tests were largely inconclusive, but a number of ships were built with &#145;kyanized&#146; timbers and a great future was predicted for the method. In 1836 Kyan sold the patent rights to the Anti-Dry Rot Company, an act of parliament being passed which authorized the raising of share capital of &pound;250,000. Tanks were constructed at Kyan's timberyard at Grosvenor basin, Pimlico, at the Grand Surrey Canal dock, Rotherhithe, and at the City Road basin. The idea of kyanizing caught the imagination, to judge from the opening verse of a song that appeared in <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> for January 1837:<blockquote>
<div>Have you heard, have you heard, Anti-dry Rot's the word?<br>
</div>
<div>Wood will never wear out, thanks to Kyan, to Kyan!<br>
</div>
<div>He dips in a tank any rafter or plank,<br>
</div>
<div>And makes it immortal as Dian, as Dian!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Among the early applications of the process was the kyanizing of the palings round the Inner Circle, Regent's Park, which was carried out in 1835 as an advertisement, small brass plates being attached to the palings at intervals stating that the wood had been submitted to the new process. Kyanized timber was used in the construction of a number of large buildings in London and elsewhere. When wooden railway sleepers became general (in place of the stone blocks used on the early lines), a very profitable business for Kyan's company was anticipated, and for a time these hopes were realized. But it became evident that iron fastenings could not be used in wood treated by the method, on account of corrosive action, and it was said that the wood became brittle. The salt was somewhat expensive, and Sir William Burnett's method of preserving timber by chloride of zinc, and afterwards the application of creosote for that purpose, proved severe competitors. Doubts began to be expressed as to the real efficacy of kyanizing and the process gradually ceased to be employed.<br>
<br>Besides the invention with which his name is associated, Kyan took out patents in 1833 (no. 6534) for propelling ships by a jet of water ejected at the stern, and in 1837 (no. 7460) for a method of obtaining ammoniacal salts from gas liquor. He was also the author of <span class="italic">The Elements of Light and their Identity with those of Matter Radiant or Fixed</span>, 1838. He died on 5 January 1850 at New York, where he was engaged on a plan for filtering the water supplied to that city by the Croton aqueduct.<br>
