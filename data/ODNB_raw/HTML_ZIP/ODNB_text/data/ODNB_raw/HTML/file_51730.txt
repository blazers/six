<span class="headword">Miller,  Hugh  Crichton-</span>  (1877&#150;1959), <span class="occ">psychotherapist</span>, was born on 5 February 1877 in Genoa, Italy, the first of four children born to Donald Miller (<i>b</i>. 1838), the Presbyterian chaplain there, and his second wife, Mary Wotherspoon. In 1889 Crichton-Miller was sent to Fettes College in Edinburgh. He then entered Edinburgh University in 1893, graduating MA in 1898 and MD in 1901. In 1903, following an eight-year engagement, he married Eleanore Jean (1876&#150;1954), daughter of Sheriff Lorimer QC of Edinburgh; they had six children, including Donald Crichton-Miller, who became headmaster of Fettes and Stowe School.<br>
<br>Following a brief period as resident house surgeon and house physician at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary (1900&#150;01), Crichton-Miller entered general practice and combined his love of Scotland and Italy by working in the summers in Aviemore and in the winters in San Remo. Studying the many hypochondriacs led to his reputation as a specialist in nervous disorders. Since there were then no treatments for functional nervous disorders, he gave up general practice and as an advocate of the new psychology settled in London in 1911, established a consulting practice, and opened Bowden House, a private nursing home at Harrow specializing in treating neuroses. He published <span class="italic">Hypnotism and Disease</span> (1912). During the First World War, Crichton-Miller served in Alexandria, where he was in charge of functional nervous disorders, and later at the 4th London General Hospital, as consultant in shell-shock. The large numbers of shell-shocked troops provided a valuable spur to the medical deployment of psychotherapeutic techniques in the immediate post-war period. It was within this context that Crichton-Miller gained backing for a clinic specializing in nervous disorders, the Tavistock Clinic, which he founded in 1920. In 1926 he established the first child guidance training team. Effective in delegating, he was a careful mentor and inspiring lecturer, and synthesized a variety of approaches.<br>
<br>Over the next thirteen years Crichton-Miller published a range of texts exploring the social and medical aspects of the new psychology: <span class="italic">The New Psychology and the Teacher</span> (1921), <span class="italic">The New Psychology and the Parent</span> (1922), <span class="italic">The New Psychology and the Preacher</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Insomnia: an Outline for the Practitioner</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Marriage, Freedom and Education</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Psychoanalysis and its Derivatives</span> (1933). Formal recognition of his expertise came with his election as president of the psychiatric section of the Royal Society of Medicine (1938), president of the International Society for Psychotherapy (1938), and fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatry (1939). Unfortunately illness caused him to curtail his professional activities during the 1940s. He resigned his posts at the Tavistock and the Stanborough Hospital (1941); in 1945, two years after the death of his son, he relinquished his London practice, and he retired as medical director of Bowden House in 1952. He died of Parkinson's disease on 1 January 1959 at Bowden House.<br>
