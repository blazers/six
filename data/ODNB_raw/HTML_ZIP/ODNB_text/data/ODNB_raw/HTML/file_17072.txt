<span class="headword">Low,  George</span>  (1747&#150;1795), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, born at the farm of Meikle Tullo, near Edzell, Forfarshire, and baptized at Edzell on 29 March 1747, was the third of five children of John Low (<i>d</i>. 1760), tenant farmer and church officer, and his wife, Isobel Coupar 
    (or possibly Cooper; <i>fl</i>. 1730&#150;1760)
  . He was educated at the parish school, and then for one year at Brechin grammar school. In 1762 he enrolled in the faculty of arts at Marischal College, Aberdeen, but left the following year for the University of St Andrews, where he studied first under Robert Watson, professor of philosophy, at St Salvator's College (1763&#150;6), and then took up divinity at St Mary's College (1766&#150;7). A remarkable commonplace book written by him while at St Andrews, entitled &#145;A cabinet of curiosities&#146; and dated 1766, is still extant in manuscript and indicates his early eclectic interests.<br>
<br>Low went to Orkney in late 1767 or early in 1768 as tutor to the sons of Baillie Robert Graham, merchant of Stromness, where he devoted most of the remainder of his life to the study of the natural history and antiquities of the Orkney and Shetland archipelagos. He commenced by careful observations of the birds, fishes, and flora of Orkney, and became enthralled with the study of microscopy, constructing a &#145;water microscope&#146;, and in 1769 beginning a series of &#145;Microscopical observations&#146;, a work illustrated with attractive Indian-ink sketches.<br>
<br>Isolated as he was from other scientific workers, with much of his time occupied as a tutor (an occupation which he disliked), and possessing hardly any books, the zeal with which he conducted these pioneer studies can hardly be overestimated. He also set to work about 1770 upon what became perhaps his major work, a &#145;History of Orkney&#146;, in which he contemplated embodying accounts of the history and antiquities, as well as of the natural history and topography of the islands, and for this purpose translated into English Torfaeus's <span class="italic">Orcades</span> (1697), a history of Orkney. Low was licensed as minister by the presbytery of Cairston in 1771, but remained for three years longer at Stromness.<br>
<br>In 1772 Sir Joseph Banks visited Orkney on his return from Iceland, in company with Daniel Solander and James Lind. Low acted as their guide and assisted them in the excavation of Bronze age burials at Skaill, an event which probably first aroused his interest in antiquities. Low was introduced by them to the antiquary and bibliophile George Paton of Edinburgh, who lent him books and became his friend, and to Thomas Pennant, with whom he began corresponding, and from whom his antiquarian studies derived further important stimulus. In the summer of 1774 Low made, at Pennant's expense, an extended tour of the south islands of Orkney and the whole of the Shetland group, and sent Pennant some materials for his <span class="italic">Tour in Scotland</span> (1776). Low began writing, with a view to publication, an exhaustive account of his tour, which dealt with the commerce, the population, and language, as well as with the archaeological and other records of the islands. On 14 December 1774 he was appointed minister to the remote parish of Birsay and Harray, on the mainland of Orkney, through the patronage of Sir Laurence Dundas. On 25 August the following year he married Helen, only daughter of James Tyrie, minister of Stromness and Sandwick; she died on 2 December 1776, after giving birth to a stillborn child.<br>
<br>In the seclusion of Birsay, Low completed his &#145;History&#146; together with his accounts of &#145;Fauna&#146; and &#145;Flora&#146; respectively of the islands of Orkney. In 1778 to complete his survey of the islands he made a tour through the north isles of Orkney, the manuscript of which was published eventually in 1915. In 1781 he became a corresponding member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. From this date until 1790 he was engaged in a succession of futile endeavours to get his manuscripts published. Though not published during his lifetime, his writings were extensively circulated and employed by others. Richard Gough introduced quotations from him into his <span class="italic">British Topography</span> (1780), and Pennant inserted, besides descriptions, several engravings from Low's drawings into his <span class="italic">Arctic Zoology</span> (1784&#150;7). The manuscript of Low's &#145;History&#146; was extensively plagiarized by George Barry in his <span class="italic">History of the Orkney Islands</span> (1805), which includes important samples of the Norn language of Shetland (a dialect of West Norse) collected by Low in 1774. Such was the extent of use of Low's information by others that Samuel Hibbert, writing in 1822, managed only with some difficulty to cull information respecting the earlier customs of Shetland that had not already been used. The <span class="italic">Fauna Orcadensis</span> was eventually published in 1813 by William Elford Leach. Pennant's attempts to find a publisher for Low's 1774 tour proved futile, and it remained unpublished until edited by Joseph Anderson, with an introduction containing extracts from Low's correspondence, in 1879.<br>
<br>The fate of Low's manuscripts became the subject of an increasingly acrimonious correspondence between Pennant, Gough, and Paton. Disappointed at the scant recognition of his labours, and embittered and disillusioned by the increasing coldness of Pennant and other friends, Low's health began a steady decline from about 1781, with recurrent episodes of cough, pleurisy, and latterly of rheumatism and weight loss. In particular, his eyesight began to fail, and from 1793 he became almost completely blind. Nevertheless, he did manage to provide a description of Birsay parish for Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span> (1791&#150;94). Low died on 13 March 1795 at Birsay, and was buried on the 16th beneath the pulpit in Birsay church. He was clearly a good naturalist and was remembered as an eloquent preacher. His hobbies included fishing and shooting, and, particularly after his eyesight failed, music.<br>
<br>Many of the unfortunate naturalist's manuscripts fell into the hands of his friend Paton, at whose death they were distributed; their subsequent history is complex. Important collections were made during the nineteenth century by Dr Omand, Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, and David Laing. These manuscripts, including those of the important &#145;Tours&#146;, the &#145;Flora Orcadensis&#146;, and the &#145;History of Orkney&#146;, are now located mainly in Edinburgh University Library, the National Museums of Scotland, and the National Library of Scotland.<br>
