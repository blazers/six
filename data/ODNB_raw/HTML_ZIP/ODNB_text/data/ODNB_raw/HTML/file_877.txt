<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Attwood,  Thomas</span>  (1765&#150;1838), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born on 23 November 1765, probably at 20 Eaton Street, Pimlico, Middlesex. He was the second of the six children of Thomas Attwood (<i>d</i>. 1825), a coal merchant and musician who played trumpet, horn, and viola in the king's band, and his wife, Ann. At the age of nine he became a chorister in the Chapel Royal, where he received his earliest musical education from James Nares and Edmund Ayrton. Here he came to the attention of the prince of Wales, who invited him to perform at Buckingham House and, impressed by his musical talent, paid for him to continue his studies abroad.<br>
<br>Between 1783 and 1785 Attwood studied in Naples under Felipe Cinque and Gaetano Latilla. In August 1785 he moved to Vienna, where he took lessons with Mozart. According to the not always reliable <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> of Michael Kelly, Mozart thought highly of him, remarking that<blockquote>Attwood is a young man for whom I have a sincere affection and esteem; he conducts himself with great propriety, and I feel much pleasure in telling you, that he partakes more of my style than any scholar I ever had; and I predict that he will prove a sound musician. (Kelly, 228)</blockquote>His harmony and counterpoint exercises, annotated with Mozart's model examples and corrections, provide a unique insight into the latter's activities as a teacher. Attwood's warm relationship with Mozart and his family at this time is attested by a letter of 5 February 1821 to him from Mozart's widow, Constanze, in which she remembered with affection their former acquaintance in Vienna and assured him of her continued friendship.<br>
<br>During his time in Vienna Attwood was part of a group of English-speaking musicians that included the composer Stephen Storace, his sister Ann, or Nancy, as she was generally known (the first Susanna in Mozart's <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span>), and Michael Kelly (the first Don Basilio and Curzio). When he returned to London in March 1787, three weeks after leaving Vienna, it was in the company of the Storaces.<br>
<br>Attwood quickly resumed his musical career in London and renewed his connections with the royal family. He was briefly one of the chamber musicians of the prince of Wales until the prince's perilous finances obliged him to dismiss his private band. He was appointed music teacher to Princess Frederika of Prussia in December 1791 following her marriage to the duke of York. Similarly, he became the teacher of Princess Caroline following her marriage to the prince of Wales in April 1795. Both of these appointments are said to have been far from sinecures and to have taken a good deal of his time. According to Attwood's lengthy obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1838, vol. 9), his association with Princess Caroline cost him dearly, for after her estrangement from the prince of Wales the prince &#145;lost sight of him&#146; and did not renew his patronage until after his coronation as George IV in July 1821.<br>
<br>Attwood also pursued his career outside the court. Soon after his return to England he had become deputy organist to F. C. Rheinhold at the church of St George the Martyr, Queen Square, Bloomsbury. This was a relatively insignificant appointment. The possibility of a more important position arose from the death on 17 February 1796 of John Jones, who simultaneously held the posts of organist of the Charterhouse, St Paul's Cathedral, and the Inner Temple. According to his friend and colleague R. J. S. Stevens, who had the information from Attwood himself, Attwood's first ambition was for the Charterhouse position. He expressed his interest to the prince of Wales, who after making some enquiries informed him that &#145;he was sorry he could not assist him in his application for the Charterhouse Organ, for that Stevens, Lord Thurlow's man, would undoubtedly have the place&#146;. Stevens, who had been Jones's deputy at the Charterhouse, was duly appointed, but Attwood was shortly afterwards appointed to St Paul's, despite being apparently an organist of only very modest abilities. He held this position until his death. On the death of Thomas Sanders Dupuis later in 1796 he succeeded him as composer to the Chapel Royal.<br>
<br>Attwood composed a good deal of Anglican church music, including three morning and evening services, eighteen anthems, and numerous psalm tunes, chants, responses, and hymns. In many of these Mozart's influence can be discerned. His anthem &#145;Turn thy face from my sins&#146; (1835) and his hymn &#145;Come holy ghost&#146; (1831) remain in the repertories of cathedral and church choirs at the end of the twentieth century. His most ambitious compositions for the church were the anthems with orchestral accompaniment written for the coronations of George IV and William IV. The <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> and <span class="roman">Nunc dimittis</span> from his evening service in F of 1796 were used at the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1805 and at Attwood's own funeral.<br>
<br>For a time, principally in the 1790s, Attwood pursued an active career as a theatre musician and was responsible for part or all of the music for more than thirty productions, largely pasticcios or afterpieces. In his own contributions to these pieces the effect of Mozart's teaching can again be heard. Many of them also contain Mozart's own music, adapted to English words: a notable example is the appearance in <span class="italic">The Prisoner</span> (1792) of the aria &#145;Non pi&ugrave; andrai&#146; from <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span>. The composer was probably the Attwood who appears in the manuscript account books of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, as having been paid &pound;28 15<i>s</i>. on 29 October 1792 and &pound;33 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. on 5 May 1794 for copying music parts and for &#145;attendance&#146; at the theatre. He was the house composer at Covent Garden in the 1798&#150;9 and 1799&#150;1800 seasons, for which he was paid &pound;6 per week. After 1801 his involvement with the theatres declined as his commitment to other forms of music increased.<br>
<br>Attwood was active in London concert life. Shortly after his return to England he was involved with J. B. Cramer and Muzio Clementi in performances of Mozart's piano concertos and chamber music at the semi-private concerts of the Anacreontic Society. In 1789&#150;90 he was pianist at the oratorio concerts at Drury Lane, and on 25 March 1790 he played a piano concerto of his own composition there. Two sets of his piano trios were published in 1787 and 1791; in their idiom and in the independent writing for the violin and cello they show an unmistakable debt to similar works by Mozart.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1793 Attwood married Mary Denton, the only daughter of Matthew Denton of Stotfold, Bedfordshire, at St John-at-Wapping. They had five sons and a daughter. His wife and four of his children survived him.<br>
<br>In addition to his commitments at St Paul's, at court, and in the theatre, Attwood also found time for private instrumental teaching of a relatively lowly nature. Stevens records that Attwood took over his pupils at Mrs Ray's school, Streatham, in 1800, and his private pupils in 1805. In his leisure hours he was active in the glee clubs, which provided opportunities for dining and sociable singing in the company of his fellow musicians. He was a member of the Harmonists' Society, where he was for many years Stevens's deputy as conductor, and of the Concentores Sodales.<br>
<br>Attwood was admitted as a member of the Royal Society of Musicians on 7 June 1789. He was a member of the court of assistants in 1813, 1814, and 1821, and a governor in 1821. He was one of the thirty original members of the Philharmonic Society on its foundation in 1813, a director from 1816 to 1820 and from 1824 to 1832, and treasurer in 1820. For many years he directed one Philharmonic Society concert every season; included in his programmes were the last five symphonies of Mozart and the first English performance of Beethoven's fifth symphony. He was one of the first professors at the Royal Academy of Music at its foundation in 1823.<br>
<br>Attwood's fortunes at court revived in 1821. For the coronation of George IV he had written an anthem, &#145;The king shall rejoice&#146;. This brought him once again to the notice of the king, who subsequently appointed him organist to his private chapel at the Brighton Pavilion, a position described in his obituary as &#145;a post of honour, as leading to frequent intercourse with royalty, but unaccompanied by profit, the expenses attending it far exceeding the amount of the salary&#146;. On the death of his father in 1825 he succeeded him as musician in ordinary to the king. In 1836 he succeeded Stafford Smith as organist of the Chapel Royal. He wrote a further anthem (&#145;O Lord grant the king a long life&#146;) for the coronation of William IV in 1831, and is said to have left a third, commissioned for the coronation of Victoria, unfinished at his death.<br>
<br>Attwood was a genial and sociable man with a wide circle of friends. In later life he was a close friend of Mendelssohn, who during his first visit to Britain in 1829 convalesced at Attwood's home in Norwood following an accident, and stayed with him there on a number of subsequent occasions. Mendelssohn's capriccio in E minor, op. 16 no. 2, was composed at Norwood during his 1829 stay, and his three preludes and fugues, op. 37, are dedicated to Attwood &#145;with reverence and gratitude&#146;. Among Attwood's many pupils were John Goss, George Bridgetower, Cipriani Potter, and his godson Thomas Attwood Walmisley, who published <span class="italic">Attwood's Cathedral Music</span>, a memorial collection of his church music compositions, in 1852.<br>
<br>Attwood died at his house at 17 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, on 24 March 1838. Shortly after Christmas 1837 he had been<blockquote>attacked by a malady which required prompt treatment; but, unhappily for his family and friends, his predilection for a new system of medicine prevented his having recourse to sanctioned remedies, till his disease had attained the mastery, and his case had become hopeless. (<span class="italic">GM</span>)</blockquote>His funeral was at St Paul's Cathedral on 31 March 1838 and was attended by members of the cathedral choir, the gentlemen and children of the Chapel Royal, part of the choir of Westminster Abbey, and a considerable number of pupils and friends. The large attendance indicates the esteem and affection in which he was held. According to his obituary,<blockquote>only those personally acquainted with him could form a perfect estimate of his private character. Affectionate to his family, faithful to his friends, benevolent to all, and honourable in every transaction of life, he was no less to be valued as a member of society than as an artist who did honour to the country of his birth. (ibid., 551)</blockquote>He was buried in St Paul's, close to the organ, where a memorial tablet was later erected to his memory.<br>
