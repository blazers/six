<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ortelius,  Abraham</span>  (1527&#150;1598), <span class="occ">map maker</span>, was born at Antwerp on 4 April 1527, the eldest of the three children of Leonard Ortels (1500&#150;1537), a merchant who probably dealt in antiques; his grandfather Wilhelm Ortels had migrated in 1460 from Augsburg to Antwerp, where he died in 1511. When Leonard died in 1537 he left a widow, Anne Herwayers (<i>fl</i>. 1527&#150;1581), and three small children, Abraham, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1600), and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1594). Little is known about Ortelius's education, but his father had started to teach him Latin and he must have studied mathematics on his own. After his father's death he came under the care of his uncle Jacob van Meteren, who had returned from England after spending several years there to escape persecution for his Reformation sympathies. Ortelius became a lifelong friend of his cousin Emanuel van Meteren, who would later settle in London. Ortelius's sister Elizabeth also moved to London following her marriage to Jacob Cole in 1562. Their eldest son, Jacobus Colius Ortelianus or <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20853/', "Jacob Cool (1563&#150;1628)")</script>, was to be an important figure in Ortelius's later years, not least as a correspondent. Ortelius remained unmarried and spent his life in Antwerp, living with his unmarried sister Anne and his mother.<br>
<br>In 1547 Ortelius was admitted to Antwerp's Guild of Saint Luke as an illuminator of maps. Besides colouring maps, assisted by his sisters, he soon traded in books, prints, and maps. He went to the Frankfurt book fairs, where he made contact with Gerardus Mercator in 1554. Business evidently went well, permitting Ortelius to accumulate a library of many volumes and an extensive collection including coins (represented by his <span class="italic">Deorum dearumque capita</span>, 1573), medals, and objects of natural history. He travelled widely in the Low Countries (reflected in the <span class="italic">Itinerarium per nonnullas Galliae Belgicae partes</span>, which he published with Joannes Vivianus in 1584), to France, Italy, Germany, and, in 1577, to England and Ireland. Next to his native Dutch (Flemish), he was reported to be versed in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Ortelius became one of the leading humanists of the Low Countries, acquainted with many European intellectuals of his time. His extensive correspondence and his <span class="italic">Album amicorum</span>, which constitute the primary sources for his life and work, provide detailed evidence of his extensive network of correspondents. In England his numerous contacts included William Camden, whose <span class="italic">Britannia</span> was first undertaken at Ortelius's urging, Richard Hakluyt the elder, the naturalist Thomas Penny, the puritan controversialist William Charke, and Humphrey Llwyd, who provided Ortelius with the map of England and Wales published in the 1573 edition of the latter's <span class="italic">Theatrum</span>.<br>
<br>Having started his professional career as an illuminator of maps, and then become a dealer and collector of maps, Ortelius eventually started making maps himself. His first map, a wall map of the world, was published in 1564 and was followed by a map of ancient Egypt (1565), a wall map of Asia (1567), a wall map of Spain (1570), and a map of the Roman empire (1571). He had already acquired some renown and means when in 1570 he published his <span class="italic">Theatrum orbis terrarum</span>, considered to be the first modern atlas, being a handy collection of maps of the same dimensions providing a survey of the world as known up to that moment. The first edition contained 53 map sheets and a list of 87 map makers (<span class="italic">Catalogus auctorum tabularum geographicarum</span>) used as sources for the maps. The <span class="italic">Theatrum</span> was an instant success, although it was the most expensive book produced in the second half of the sixteenth century. Altogether twenty-one enlarged editions and thirteen supplements (<span class="italic">Additamenta</span>) appeared during Ortelius's lifetime, followed by another thirteen enlarged editions after his death, the last one in 1641. The original Latin text of the geographical descriptions was translated into German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, and English (1606). Filips Galle issued a popular version of the <span class="italic">Theatrum</span> as <span class="italic">Spieghel der Werelt</span> (&#145;Mirror of the world&#146;, 1577). Most editions of this pocket atlas are known under the name <span class="italic">Epitome</span>.<br>
<br>Ortelius was more of a map editor than an original cartographer. He obtained maps and information from the best authorities for the compilation of his atlas. At heart, he was less a &#145;cosmographus&#146; than a humanist, obsessed by antiquity, and he was a pioneer in the construction of historical maps related to the ancient world. From 1579 onwards, historical maps were added to the <span class="italic">Theatrum</span> as an appendix (<span class="italic">Parergon</span>). Unlike the modern <span class="italic">Theatrum</span> maps, the <span class="italic">Parergon</span> maps were designed by Ortelius himself. The latest edition of 1624, the only separate <span class="italic">Parergon</span> edition, consisted of forty-four historical maps. Ortelius also compiled a catalogue of all place names listed by classical authors, along with their modern forms. Initially part of his <span class="italic">Theatrum</span>, the list assumed such dimensions that it was published separately (<span class="italic">Synonymia geographica</span>, 1578; reworked as <span class="italic">Thesaurus geographicus</span>, 1587). Another list of classical place names, devoted exclusively to Ptolemy, continued to be included in the <span class="italic">Theatrum</span> as <span class="italic">Nomenclator Ptolemaicus</span>. Finally, Ortelius published a charming booklet devoted to the life and customs of the ancient Germans (<span class="italic">Aurei saeculi imago</span>, 1596).<br>
<br>Ortelius is depicted by his biographers as a pious, broad-minded, and tolerant man, highly regarded by his contemporaries. It has been suggested that he might have been in contact with the Family of Love, a heterodox sect, through his friend Christophe Plantin. Nevertheless his Catholic faith does not seem to have been questioned at any time by the agents of the Spanish crown, and he obtained the title of &#145;his majesty's geographer&#146; from Philip II in 1573. From 1579 onwards an engraved portrait by Filips Galle was incorporated in the <span class="italic">Theatrum</span>. Most later portraits, such as the one by Rubens (in the Museum Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp), are derived from Galle's engraving.<br>
<br>Ortelius died in Antwerp on 28 June 1598. He was buried on 1 July in the church of St Michael in Antwerp, where a memorial stone and a funeral monument were erected to his remembrance. The monument was destroyed in 1796, and only its medallions were saved, one of them carved with Ortelius's effigy and another with his device around a globe (<i>Contemno et orno, mente, manu</i>; &#145;I scorn and adorn with mind and hand&#146;); these remain today at the Nationaal Scheepvaartmuseum in Antwerp. The gravestone was transferred to Antwerp Cathedral in 1803.<br>
