<span class="headword">Delaval <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Livingston]</span>, Lady  Elizabeth</span>  (1648?&#150;1717), <span class="occ">memoirist and Jacobite agent</span>, was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16807/', "James Livingston, first earl of Newburgh (1621/2&#150;1670)")</script>, nobleman, and his first wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1650), eldest daughter of Theophilus Howard, second earl of Suffolk, and widow of George Stuart, ninth seigneur d'Aubigny. Her parents were supporters of Charles I during the civil war and fled from Bagshot, Surrey, to The Hague in 1649. After the death of her mother in 1650, Lady Elizabeth was brought up by her father's sister, Dorothy, wife of the second Lord Stanhope, at Nocton, Lincolnshire, before being appointed in 1662, when she was fourteen, a maid of the privy chamber to Catherine of Braganza through the offices of her half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26696/', "Charles Stuart, third duke of Richmond")</script>.<br>
<br>Lady Elizabeth is of interest as the writer of a manuscript volume of memoirs and meditations, now in the Bodleian Library, whose entries cover events in her personal life between 1663 and 1672. The volume itself appears to have been created many years after the events described, a fair copy transcribed from notes and loose documents. Its contents, which were mistakenly classified by Kirchberger as a &#145;religious diary&#146;  (Kirchberger, 59) and by Craster as a &#145;common place book&#146;  (Craster, &#145;Notes&#146;, 149), consist of a series of long prose entries, prayers, transcribed letters, and a poem. The reader is assisted with dated, descriptive headings and helpful marginal glosses identifying various people mentioned, which suggests the volume was intended for a wider readership than just the author herself. Through her narration of her childhood and her romantic misadventures, the volume sheds light on the upbringing and marriage arrangements of a girl belonging to a prominent royalist family and documents the range and nature of the reading and writing habits of a late seventeenth-century Englishwoman composing her autobiography.<br>
<br>The early entries, written when Lady Elizabeth was fourteen, described selected events from her childhood that she saw as having shaped her character. She noted that she was very fond of reading romances, and that by the age of ten she had &#145;red severall great volumns of them; all Casander, the Grand Cyrus, Cleopatra and Astrea&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 78, fol. 15). As a child she also appeared in several theatrical performances staged at Nocton, even persuading the family servants to act in a performance of Guarini's <span class="italic">Il pastor fido</span> with herself as Amaryllis. Interspersed among her accounts of the secular events of her life are prayers and meditations on her attempts to control her passions. Her rendering of the events of her life, however, is shaped more by the conventions of romance fiction than religious meditation.<br>
<br>After becoming a maid in the queen's household Lady Elizabeth quickly became disillusioned with court life, castigating herself for contracting debts she could not pay and flirting with attractive young men. She noted, without apparent irony, that the men behaved and spoke just like her favourite romance characters and described falling in love with James, Lord Annesley, son of the earl of Anglesey; according to her memoirs, it was her aunt and not her father who objected to this match. The conclusion of their relationship resembled a typically tangled seventeenth-century romance plot: Annesley gave way to pressure from his father and in 1669 married Lady Elizabeth Manners, sister of Lord Roos. Roos had, apparently, combined with Lady Stanhope to engineer the marriage with the design of removing Annesley from the scene and marrying Lady Elizabeth himself. The final entries of the memoir chronicled Lady Elizabeth's bitter disappointment with the fickleness of her lover, described her lack of interest in her father's choice for her marriage partner, Robert (1647&#150;1682), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47991/', "Sir Ralph Delaval")</script> of Seaton Delaval, Northumberland [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73888/', "Delaval family")</script>], and their subsequent lacklustre marriage, which commenced about July 1670. They had no children.<br>
<br>Lady Elizabeth did not complete her personal history, leaving the final third of the volume blank, but she lived on for many years. In November 1677 she unsuccessfully sought an appointment with the newly married Mary, princess of Orange, and in January 1682 she was reported to be in London but &#145;looks very plaine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.64). Her husband died on 1 August 1682 and by a licence of 1 April 1686 Lady Elizabeth married Henry Hatcher of Kirby, Lincolnshire, who was aged about twenty-two. In 1689 she was involved in the so-called Pewter pot plot and a warrant was issued for her arrest for carrying correspondence from the exiled court of James II; the leader of this plot was Edward, Lord Griffin, the husband of her cousin Essex, both of whom are mentioned with affection in her memoirs. Abandoning England for France, Lady Elizabeth is said to have died in Rouen in 1717.<br>
