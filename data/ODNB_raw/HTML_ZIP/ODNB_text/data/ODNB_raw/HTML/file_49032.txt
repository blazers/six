<span class="headword">Shipley,  Joseph</span>  (1795&#150;1867), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born on 12 April 1795 in Shipley House, on the corner of 16th and French streets, Wilmington, Delaware, USA. He was the eleventh of twelve children of a Quaker, Joseph Shipley (1752&#150;1832), whose grandfather William Shipley had left his native Leicestershire to settle at Wilmington, and of Mary Levis (<i>d</i>. 1843) of Springfield, Delaware county, Pennsylvania. Although there is no definite information, it is evident from his correspondence that he received a good general and an excellent business education. It is likely he worked as a clerk for Samuel Canby, jun., of Philadelphia, whose letters reveal a fatherly interest in him.<br>
<br>Shipley's first definite employment was with John Welsh, a leading Philadelphia merchant, who sent him to Virginia to buy depreciated southern banknotes during the panic of 1819. Welsh then sent him to Liverpool, first as his agent in Joseph Shipley Jr &amp; Co., Welsh being represented by &#145;&amp; Co.&#146;, then from January 1822 as his Liverpool partner, in Shipley, Welsh &amp; Co. By 1825 Shipley had conducted affairs so well that he was invited by William Brown, of William and James Brown &amp; Co. of Liverpool, to become from January 1826 a junior partner in that firm.<br>
<br>Shipley thus joined the leading firm in Atlantic commerce, with branches in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, as well as in Liverpool, and with agents in the southern United States cotton ports. The firm consigned British manufactured goods to the USA, received huge volumes of American staples, especially cotton, ran packet lines, offered advances and credits to smaller merchants, and negotiated foreign exchange. Shipley at first was a partner only in the Liverpool house, but in 1837 he joined all the houses and in June 1839 the Liverpool firm's name was changed to Brown Shipley in recognition of his services during the financial panic of 1837.<br>
<br>This crisis was caused by the collapse of an unsustainable boom in the USA, but Browns and the other large Anglo-American houses bore the main pressure. In late 1836 the Bank of England, afraid of gold outflows, put increasing pressure on the Liverpool houses to restrict American credits. The consequence in America in early 1837 was widespread financial collapse. By May 1837 the Browns were in severe difficulties: remittances due from America for previous credits were unpaid and cotton prices had collapsed. Shipley wrote to his cousin in Philadelphia on 14 May,<blockquote>Such a revolution in commerce in the short space of three months surely never was (hitherto) witnessed &hellip; the mind can scarcely realise it. It has been only in the last week to ten days that I have begun seriously to apprehend the possible loss of nearly all the earnings of eleven laborious, anxious years. (Shipley to Newlin, 14 May 1837, Hargraves collection)</blockquote>In these circumstances Shipley, William Brown being ill, visited London several times in late May and early June, and with the help of the Browns' bankers, Joseph Denison &amp; Co., persuaded the Bank of England to offer Browns a loan of &pound;2 million, a quite unprecedented sum. Shipley argued that &#145;two thirds of all our engagements arise out of the export of British manufacturers&#146;, and that &#145;disastrous consequences would follow our stoppage&#146; which &#145;would be more felt than that of any other house in England&#146;  (Brown, 83&#150;4). He was thus able to exploit fear of a systemic collapse, while the accounts showed that Browns was fundamentally sound.<br>
<br>Shipley gradually became the active partner in Brown Shipley as William Brown developed political interests. However, although in 1846 Brown became the free-trade member of parliament for South Lancashire, he still remained the senior partner, and he and James Brown still owned four-fifths of the capital. Fortunately Shipley agreed with William Brown on most important matters. Under this joint management Browns became the largest negotiator of sterling&#150;dollar exchange and the leading financier of Anglo-American trade. This was inevitably at the expense of its traditional wider interests. Hence when James Brown involved the firm in financing the Collins Line steam-packet ships in the late 1840s, both William Brown and Shipley opposed him. Shipley's importance to the firm is indicated by William Brown's reaction to this deal. He wrote to James Brown:<blockquote>Mr Shipley says little, but he seems so vexed at this transaction, I think it not at all improbable he will give us notice of retiring. If so I must do the same, for I cannot at my time of life (even if I resign my seat in Parliament) undertake the management of the business here without the assistance of a partner who I have so long known, and in whom I have every confidence as the first man of business in the Kingdom.</blockquote>He later revised this letter before transmission, but repeated his comments on Shipley, only replacing the last phrase with: &#145;as a man of strict integrity and probably the best man of business in the Kingdom&#146;  (Brown, letter-book, 23 and 29 Jan 1848).<br>
<br>Despite his doubts about the steamers Shipley remained with the firm until 1850, when he retired because of worsening gout. He returned to his family home in Wilmington, Delaware, and built a house, Rockwood, in Brandywine hundred, in the English style, and lived there with his two maiden sisters. He remained unmarried. His Liverpool house ultimately became part of Liverpool University. However, he retained a strong interest in the firms and regularly wrote them useful letters at critical times, such as in the panic of 1857 and during the civil war. He died on 8 May 1867 at Rockwood, Wilmington, and was buried at the Quaker burial-ground there.<br>
