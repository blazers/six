<span class="headword">Prince,  John Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> in or after 1818), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 21 May 1770 in the parish of St Mary, Whitechapel, the son of George Prince (<i>d</i>. 1773), originally of Dursley, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dixon (1735/6&#150;1791). He was educated in the charity school of St Mary's, Whitechapel; he started life as errand-boy to a tallow chandler, and eventually, about 1790, became clerk to an attorney in Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn. Dismissed after three years' service, Prince entered another office, and a year later became secretary to a retired solicitor, who gave him access to an excellent library. His weekly salary was only half a guinea, but he deemed it sufficient to maintain a wife, and was married on 29 May 1794; he and his wife had one daughter.<br>
<br>From 1796, when Prince's essay &#145;On detraction and calumny&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Lady's Magazine</span>, he began to turn out articles and pamphlets on the most varied subjects. He left his patron in 1797, and served with several firms of solicitors. Besides his literary and legal work, he found time to act for a while as minister of Bethesda Chapel&#151;a Methodist congregation&#151;and was prominent in debating societies, such as the London and Westminster forums. A religious organization of his own, of a methodistical type, had a short-lived existence.<br>
<br>Besides ephemeral tracts including three letters (1801&#150;2) attacking Joseph Proud, Prince wrote <span class="italic">A Defence of the People Denominated Methodists</span> (1797), <span class="italic">Original Letters and Essays on Moral and Entertaining Subjects</span> (1797), <span class="italic">The Christian's Duty to God and the Constitution at all Times, but Especially at this Critical Juncture</span> (1804, 3rd edn), and <span class="italic">Remarks on the Best Method of Barring Dower</span> (1805; republished, with additions, 1807). His <span class="italic">Life, Pedestrian Excursions, and Singular Opinions of J. H. P., Bookseller &hellip; written by Himself</span> (1806) is a lively and entertaining work, dedicated to the Society of Eccentrics, of which he declared himself a worthy and enthusiastic member.<br>
<br>In 1813 Prince was living at Islington, and in 1818 he published a small legal treatise on conveyancing. The date of his death is unknown.<br>
