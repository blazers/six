<span class="headword">Sawbridge,  George, the elder</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1621, <em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was born at Hilmorton near Rugby, the son of George Sawbridge, a Warwickshire husbandman. On 19 February 1638 he was apprenticed to the London bookseller Edward Brewster, and after seven years won his freedom on 14 April 1645; about 1646 he also won the hand of Brewster's daughter, Hannah (<i>c</i>.1625&#150;1686). When Brewster died in 1647, Sawbridge succeeded him within the Stationers' Company as treasurer of the company's joint-stock venture, the English Stock, a post he held for thirty-two years; he also served as master of the Stationers' Company for 1675&#150;6. From 1647 he operated a shop at the sign of the Bible on Ludgate Hill and sometimes sold books from his house on Clerkenwell Green. He was a leading publisher of medical literature, particularly the posthumous works and translations of Nicholas Culpeper, including a 1679 edition of the London <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia</span>. He also held shares in the chief publications of his day. He partnered with other printers throughout his career, including Edward Brewster the younger in 1653, and after the Restoration, Sawbridge was a partner in the king's printing house with Samuel Mearne, Richard Roycroft, and others. Ten apprentices were bound to Sawbridge over the years, including two Thomas Sawbridges (the first, probably George's brother, freed in 1666; the second, probably his son, freed by patrimony in 1685).<br>
<br>In 1668, as an executor of the estate of the Cambridge University printer John Field, Sawbridge camouflaged his purchase of Field's printing materials and the leasehold of the university printing house, which still had thirty-four years to run. He paid John Hayes, whose appointment as new university printer Sawbridge had secured, to pose as the owner of Field's business, though Hayes was really only Sawbridge's agent. By company ordinance Sawbridge could not have simultaneously held his post as treasurer of the English Stock and university printer, and should have reported the profits on his Cambridge business to the English Stock account. In January 1679 Sawbridge's secret connection to Hayes was exposed, and he did not stand for another term as treasurer two months later. The company, astounded by Sawbridge's deception, duly revised its rules so that subsequent treasurers had to give up their bookselling businesses entirely and furnish &pound;1000 in securities through guarantors from outside the company. Inventories of Sawbridge's property, mostly investments in the book trade, show him to have been a very wealthy man when he died in London in July 1681; his estate was valued at &pound;11,000, plus a further &pound;15,000 owed to him. In 1683 Sawbridge's widow paid the company &pound;158, a sum that a committee investigating his Cambridge swindle had decided was due to the company.<br>
<br>Hannah Sawbridge maintained the shop at the Bible for five years after her husband's death; her imprint can be found on fifty-two works. She and her son Thomas both died in 1686. The fellow bookman John Dunton remarked on four Sawbridge daughters provided for by their parents, but there was concern about the absence of lands for inheritance. Some confusion persists over the relationship of the Sawbridges to the bookseller George Sawbridge the younger, probably a grandson or grandnephew, who succeeded Thomas Sawbridge at the Three Golden Fleur de Luces in Little Britain, London, in 1692. Despite his misappropriation of English Stock moneys, the elder George Sawbridge left a reputation in the trade that prompted Dunton to describe him as &#145;the greatest bookseller that has been in England for many years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Errors</span>, 291).<br>
