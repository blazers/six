<span class="headword">Purdy,  John</span>  (1773&#150;1843), <span class="occ">hydrographer</span>, was born on 14 August 1773 at Norwich, the eldest of four known children of John Purdy, a tailor and freeman of the city, and his wife, Sarah Cady. While John was still young the family moved to London, where in 1795 he entered an apprenticeship with David Steel, nautical publisher and bookseller, of Little Tower Hill. In 1806 he drew his first known charts; these were of English Channel harbours, published by Steel's widow and successor, Penelope Mason, and of the North Sea, published by Laurie and Whittle of 53 Fleet Street. Within a few years he was working exclusively for Laurie and Whittle and by 1812 had become its principal hydrographer. He compiled charts and wrote the accompanying sailing directions for Laurie and Whittle and its successor, R. H. Laurie, until his death.<br>
<br>Purdy's greatest contribution was to the knowledge of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. In his <span class="italic">Memoir &hellip; to Accompany the New Chart of the Atlantic Ocean</span> (1812, with eight editions in his lifetime) he made available to ordinary navigators James Rennell's work on ocean currents. Rennell had &#145;a high opinion of his talents&#146;, and in 1832 his daughter, Lady Rodd, entrusted Purdy with editing her father's <span class="italic">Wind and Current Charts</span>. Purdy's other works included <span class="italic">Tables of the Positions &hellip;</span> (1816), to accompany Laurie and Whittle's <span class="italic">Oriental Navigator</span>; <span class="italic">The Columbian Navigator</span> (1817); and works on the south Atlantic, northern European waters, and the Mediterranean. Most of these went through several editions in his lifetime and continued in print after his death under the editorship of his successor, Alexander George Findlay.<br>
<br>Purdy exchanged information with leading hydrographers of the day, both British and foreign. He was respected as the foremost authority in private chart publishing, where he was exceptional for the care with which he acknowledged the many varied sources on which his work was based. His work and letters give the impression of a meticulous, modest, and industrious man; however, nothing is known of his private life. He died of gangrene of the leg at his home at 29 Gloucester Street, Clerkenwell, London, on 29 January 1843.<br>
