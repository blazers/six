<span class="headword">Simms,  George Otto</span>  (1910&#150;1991), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born in Dublin on 4 July 1910, the third of the four children of John Francis Arthur Simms, of Combermore, Lifford, co. Donegal, crown solicitor for co. Tyrone, and his wife, Ottilie Sophie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Strange (1879&#150;1960). His mother had been born in Australia, the daughter of Otto Georg Christian Strange, a professor of music. The family returned to Germany on the death of her mother, and she was educated in Germany and England; she married Simms's father in 1903. The Simms family had been resident in co. Donegal since the seventeenth century. J. F. A. Simms was scholarly, gracious, kind, and deeply involved in the life of the Church of Ireland, a member of the general synod and legal assessor to the bishop of Derry and Raphoe.<br>
<br>Simms attended the Prior endowed school in Lifford, beside the family home (1915&#150;20). In May 1920 he went to St Edmund's School, Hindhead, Surrey, where W. H. Auden was head boy, and where Simms himself was also later head boy. There he showed a strong propensity for classics. In 1924 he entered Cheltenham College on winning a scholarship. He took an enthusiastic part in all aspects of college life, including sport, scholarship, and social and cultural activities. He considered ordination seriously at this time. In January 1929 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, to read classics, ancient history, and political science. He was elected a foundation scholar in classics in 1930 and was awarded the Berkeley gold medal for Greek, the vice-chancellor's Latin medal, and the Booke prize for classics. He won a double moderatorship in 1932, then won a theological exhibition and graduated BD in 1935. He was ordained deacon in the Church of Ireland on 25 March 1935 for the assistant curacy of St Bartholomew's parish, Dublin, where Walter Cadden Simpson, a strong Oxford Movement Christian socialist, was vicar. In 1938, at the invitation of Eric Abbott, supported by William Temple, he became chaplain of Lincoln Theological College. There he developed his interest in modern European theology, assisted by his fluency in German and French, and made many long-lasting friendships in the Church of England.<br>
<br>In 1940 Simms returned to Ireland as dean of residence (chaplain) at Trinity College, Dublin. He transformed this office into a vital part of university life, having an effective ministry to the whole university by force of his personality and commitment. He augmented his salary of &pound;212 p.a. by lecturing in theology and examining in classics. In 1943 he was appointed chaplain-secretary of the Church of Ireland Training College (for primary teachers). His fluency in the Irish language was vital for this post. He carried a very heavy burden of work which was necessary in later years to support a growing family, having married, in September 1941, Mercy Felicia Gwynn (1915&#150;1998), a lecturer in Italian at Trinity College and daughter of Brian James Gwynn, of Temple Hill, Terenure, Dublin. The Gwynns were a family of distinguished scholars who, like the Simms, had settled in co. Donegal in the seventeenth century. Simms and his wife&#151;who were to have three sons and two daughters&#151;shared a strong commitment to the social expression of Christianity. During the difficult war years Simms kept alive a strong Christian witness in Trinity College, organizing reading parties, conferences, and missions, and promoting ecumenism through the Mercier Society, a group of Anglican and Roman Catholic scholars which flourished in Dublin in the 1940s. Tall, handsome, with elegant classical features, Simms grew skeletally thin, kinder if possible and holier, as he flew from one commitment to another on a ramshackle bicycle in the midst of Dublin traffic, a well-known and greatly loved figure in university, church, and the city. While chaplain at Trinity College he commenced his life's scholarly work. He collated the manuscript of the <span class="roman">Book of Kells</span> and wrote the introduction for a facsimile edition (3 vols., 1950&#150;51) as joint editor with Ernest Henry Alton (provost of Trinity College) and Peter Meyer. Simms was awarded the degree of PhD by Trinity College for his work on the <span class="roman">Book of Kells</span> in 1950 and an honorary DD degree in 1952. More than a dozen of his later published works were on the <span class="roman">Book of Kells</span> and other early Irish manuscripts (including the <span class="roman">Book of Durrow</span>), and on figures from the early Irish church, such as St Patrick, St Brendan, and St Columba.<br>
<br>In 1951 Simms was appointed dean of Cork; he was installed on 16 April 1952. He immediately opened up St Fin Barre's Cathedral to the public, and published a monograph and guide to it. In October 1952 he was elected bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. His energy was prodigious. He organized a diocesan conference in Cork city hall which attracted in excess of 2000 people per night for five nights. Henry Robert McAdoo, who succeeded him as dean, described Simms's episcopate as &#145;a sort of springtime in the diocese&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 23 Nov 1991). In 1953 he commenced writing a weekly article on spiritual matters for the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, &#145;Thinking aloud&#146;, which he continued to write for thirty-eight years.<br>
<br>In December 1956 Simms was elected archbishop of Dublin and primate of Ireland. He was enthroned in Christ Church, Dublin, on 25 January 1957. His election was widely welcomed by all denominations and by all sections of the state and the community in Ireland, he being perceived as representing a new generation of the Church of Ireland. He played a major part in each of the Lambeth conferences which he attended, in 1958, 1968, and 1978. In 1958 he was chairman of the liturgy committee, the report of which was very well received. His wisdom and dexterity in ecumenical matters won the admiration of Archbishop Michael Ramsey, who appointed him co-chairman of the Anglican&#150;Roman Catholic international commission on the theology of marriage and its application to mixed marriage. In 1975 this committee produced a report indicating constructive ways ahead, some of which were adopted and implemented. In 1963 he attended the Toronto Anglican Congress, and in July 1963 he represented the Church of Ireland at the fourth assembly of the World Council of Churches in Uppsala. His contribution at both conferences was widely reported and appreciated. His activity in the Church of Ireland was also noteworthy. He was instrumental in establishing ecumenical conferences and he revived unity talks with the Methodists and Presbyterians. Together with his wife, he helped establish the Church of Ireland marriage counselling service, which soon became non-denominational and state funded. He also helped to establish a central advisory council of training for the ministry and a new election process for bishops. He chaired the liturgical advisory committee for eighteen years. He also chaired the advisory committee on administration which produced a radical and far-reaching report in 1967, which, however, did not find the support of the general synod.<br>
<br>In July 1969 Simms was elected archbishop of Armagh and primate of all Ireland. He was enthroned in St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, on 25 September 1969. Northern Ireland was by then in the grip of political turmoil and violence. Simms spent himself in every endeavour to restore peace in the province, to the point of exhaustion: visiting riot areas in Belfast, making a television appeal, preaching in churches throughout Northern Ireland, and writing pastoral letters. On the most dangerous missions and in the most dangerous areas he always refused police protection, as he felt that it could interfere with his pastoral freedom and credibility. It was said that &#145;in all his years in Armagh the hostility he encountered was rarely from Roman Catholics, but rather from extreme Protestants&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). During this troubled and dangerous period he never neglected the burden of the administration of the whole of the Church of Ireland, and his wider remit on international and inter-church bodies. He kept a peaceful mind in the midst of turmoil through prayer and meditation. He retired in February 1980. Basil Blackshaw's portrait of him (1979), which was later hung in the Alexander Synod Hall in Armagh, shows him careworn and tired, in comparison with other portraits from his early days as archbishop of Dublin.<br>
<br>Simms retired to live in a semi-detached house in Terenure, Dublin. There he enjoyed good health and an extensive programme of ministry, conducting quiet days, taking services to assist clergy, and, at the request of his successors, remaining president of the Sunday School Society; president of the Association for Promoting Christian Knowledge; chairman of the board of <span class="italic">Search</span> (a theological journal); a member of the religious education curriculum committee of the general synod Board of Education; and president of the Leprosy Mission. He enjoyed occasional commissions as lecturer on a Swan Hellenic tour, and lectured extensively in Germany in 1983 while representing the Church of Ireland at the Lutheran quincentennial celebrations. In retirement he was also able to return to his first love&#151;the early history and great religious manuscripts of the Irish church. Among his many books were <span class="italic">Irish Illuminated Manuscripts</span> (1980), <span class="italic">In my Understanding</span> (an exploration of the spiritual wisdom of the Celtic church, 1982), and biographies of Brendan the Navigator (1989) and St Patrick (1991). He wrote or co-operated in writing several parish histories. He also wrote innumerable articles in theological journals, mainly on subjects related to Celtic spirituality. He kept up a correspondence by letter with friends, fellow scholars, pupils, and people he met incidentally, in several languages. Communicating by letter was a great part of his faithful ministry. He continued to give his greatly appreciated illustrated lectures on the <span class="roman">Book of Kells</span> to the end of his life, by which time he had given more than 450 lectures all over the world. He brought a freshness and enthusiasm to each one. He died after a brief illness at the Meath Hospital, Dublin, on 15 November 1991, and was survived by his wife and five children. His ashes were interred in the churchyard of St Maelruan's parish, Tallaght, co. Dublin, after cremation on 23 November.<br>
