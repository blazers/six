<span class="headword">Stanhope <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Forester]</span>,  Anne Elizabeth</span>, countess of Chesterfield  (1802&#150;1885), <span class="occ">political confidante</span>, second child and eldest daughter of Cecil Forester (later Weld-Forester), first Baron Forester (1767&#150;1828), and his wife, Lady Katherine Manners (1779&#150;1829), second daughter of the fourth duke of Rutland, was born on 7 September 1802. Her father, who inherited Willey Park, Shropshire, from his uncle George Forester, hunted from Melton Mowbray; one of the boldest horsemen of his day and a jealous rider damned by Hugo Meynell for his &#145;splittercockation&#146; pace, he behaved with an arrogance characteristic of the Meltonians of his day. Like her sisters, Anne Forester was a beauty; she refused offers of marriage from two prime ministers, Lord Derby (who proposed in 1830) and Disraeli. On 30 November 1830 she married George Stanhope, sixth earl of Chesterfield (1805&#150;1866), a very wealthy sporting peer and owner of Bretby, Derbyshire. Greville, the diarist, met her with her sisters in 1831 and found them &#145;not remarkably amusing, as they are all more or less limited in point of intellect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 2.154). A member of the &#145;ton&#146;, the aristocratic racing and hunting set, Anne Chesterfield was well known at Newmarket; she knew D'Orsay and Francis Grant, both of whom painted her. When a haggard-looking Lord George Bentinck appeared at Newmarket in 1848, Anne Chesterfield remarked: &#145;For Heaven's sake, George, cut politics and come back to the turf, or you will be dead in six months&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences of Lady Dorothy Nevill</span>, 140). He was.<br>
<br>Anne Chesterfield had two children: a son, George (1831&#150;1871), and a much-loved daughter, Evelyn (1834&#150;1875), who married the earl of Carnarvon. Her husband, who died in 1866, was fashionable, spoilt, and a wastrel. &#145;He lies in bed half the day,&#146; reported Greville in 1846, and he confessed himself saddened by Bretby: &#145;a princely fortune dilapidated by sheer indolence, because the obstinate spoilt owner will neither look into his affairs nor let anybody else look into them&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>).<br>
<br>Lady Chesterfield retained the &#145;erect figure and elastic gait&#146; for which she was famed well into old age, and she was a well-preserved seventy when Disraeli began his romantic friendship with her and her younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50250/', "Selina Bridgeman, countess of Bradford")</script>. Though Disraeli proposed marriage to Anne, he was really in love with Selina, and Anne lapsed gracefully into the role of confidante, receiving at least 500 letters from the septuagenarian prime minister, who was a frequent guest at Bretby. &#145;The secret of her charm,&#146; wrote Disraeli, &#145;is the union of grace and energy; a union very rare but in her case most felicitous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.49). Her last years were sad. Her son died in 1871, her daughter in 1875. She continued to live at Bretby (which passed to the Carnarvon family), soothing her sorrow by playing the organ in the chapel, and died there on 27 July 1885.<br>
