</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pennant,  Thomas</span>  (1726&#150;1798), <span class="occ">naturalist, traveller, and writer</span>, was born on 14 June 1726 at Downing in the parish of Whitford (sometimes Whiteford), near Holywell, Flintshire, the eldest son of David Pennant (<i>d</i>. 1763), landowner, and Arabella (<i>d</i>. 1744), third daughter of Richard Mytton of Halston, Shropshire. His parents, notably his father, were from long-standing families: the estate, centred upon the ancient house at Bychton, had been owned by Pennants since the Norman conquest although the first to take that name, from the Welsh &#145;Pen y Nant&#146;, was Daffyd ap Tudor in the fifteenth century.<br>
<br>Pennant tells us that he was delivered in &#145;the Yellow Room&#146; by &#145;a Mrs Clayton of Shrewsbury&#146;, midwife, and, as was then customary among Welsh gentry, he was put out to foster parents nearby  (Pennant, <span class="italic">History of the Parishes</span>, 2). At age seven he was sent to the Revd Lewis's Grammar School at Wrexham which, to judge by letters to his father, he enjoyed. At age fourteen Pennant was educated at Fulham under the guidance of Thomas Croft. He was in poor health as a boy, and indeed suffered intermittently from depression for much of his life. When ill as a child he spent recuperative periods at Hadley, near Enfield Chase, at the home of his uncle, the Revd John Pennant, and at the Richmond home of James Mytton, a maternal uncle. On 7 March 1744 Pennant matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, but, as the result of disciplinary matters stemming from a dispute between students and fellows, migrated to Oriel College in May 1748. He did not take a degree, but was made an honorary DCL by the university on 11 May 1771 in recognition of his zoological work.<h2>
<a name="Earlypublications"></a>Early publications</h2>Pennant's interest in natural history was first stimulated when he was aged about twelve by the present from his kinsman John Salisbury of a copy of Francis Willoughby's <span class="italic">Ornithology</span> (1678): [this] &#145;first gave me a taste for that study, and incidentally a love for that of natural history in general, which I have since pursued with my constitutional ardor&#146;  (Pennant, <span class="italic">Literary Life</span>, 1). In 1747 he toured Cornwall, where he met the naturalist and historian the Revd Dr William Borlase, who &#145;gave me a strong passion for minerals and fossils&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Pennant's first publication, an account of an earthquake felt in Flintshire on 2 April 1750, was published in volume forty-six of the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. He published five other articles there: on fossil corals, penguins, tortoises, the turkey, and a piece on &#145;several earthquakes felt in Wales in 1781&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 71.193). During the early 1750s he participated in fossil-hunting expeditions in Wales, undertook a fifteen-week tour of Ireland in 1754 where he collected mineralogical and natural specimens despite being distracted by &#145;the conviviality of the country&#146;  (Pennant, <span class="italic">Literary Life</span>, 2), and began a correspondence with scholars such as Benjamin Stillingfleet, John Ellis, Emanuel Mendes da Costa, and, notably, with Carl Linnaeus, through whose influence Pennant was elected a member of the Vetenskapsakademien at Uppsala in 1757. His network of correspondents included members of the Sicilian and Swedish nobility and the bishop of Bergen, with all of whom he exchanged mineralogical specimens: more than 800 of Pennant's specimens survive in the British Museum (Natural History). He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 21 November 1754, although he resigned in 1760, unable to pay the annual subscription fees.<br>
<br>To judge by a letter of June 1762 to Costa, Pennant had by then begun what he called his &#145;great Design of a British Natural History&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR2017/TP408, fol. 165). The first volume of his <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> as it became was published in 1766. The delay between commencement, probably in 1761, and publication was most likely due to family circumstances. In April 1759 Pennant had married Elizabeth Falconer, daughter of James Falconer of Chester, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy. Their son, Thomas, was born in January 1760 but died in March; two further children, Arabella (<i>b</i>. 1761) and David (<i>b</i>. 1763), survived. Pennant's father, David, died in January 1763, at which point Pennant assumed the responsibilities of running the family estate (his mother had died of smallpox in April 1744). In June 1764 Elizabeth, his wife, died.<br>
<br>It has been surmised that Pennant's six-month tour of Europe in 1765 was undertaken to distance himself from these family affairs  (Evans). That may be so, but it is clear that his 1765 tour provided Pennant with an important opportunity to meet fellow naturalists and inspect collections. During the tour he travelled through France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands and met, among others, the French naturalist the comte de Buffon, Voltaire, and the German naturalist Peter Pallas.<h2>
<a name="Britishzoology"></a>British zoology</h2>The first folio edition of Pennant's <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> was followed by a more successful and smaller second edition, and by additional volumes on reptiles, fish, and marine animals. The work was organized according to the classificatory systems of John Ray, whom Pennant much admired: in a letter of 19 July 1767 Pennant referred to Ray as &#145;the father of system especially of quadrupeds &amp; birds&#146; and considered that Linnaeus &#145;owes it all to our countryman tho he has horridly mangled &amp; disjointed his excellent synopses&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 968, fol. 124). Five editions of <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> were published between 1766 and 1812. Its success prompted his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1767, the year in which he began that correspondence with Gilbert White, then curate at Farringdon in Hampshire, which, together with White's correspondence with Daines Barrington, formed the basis of White's <span class="italic">Natural History of Selborne</span> (1789).<br>
<br>Pennant's <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> was followed in 1769 by his <span class="italic">Indian Geology</span>, and in 1771 by <span class="italic">Synopsis of Quadrupeds</span> which, revised and enlarged, was published in 1781 as <span class="italic">A History of Quadrupeds</span>. In 1773 he published <span class="italic">Genera of Birds</span>, and between 1784 and 1787 the three-volume <span class="italic">Arctic Zoology</span>. In the &#145;Advertisement&#146; for this work Pennant acknowledged the influence of Francis Willoughby: &#145;Emulous of so illustrious an example, I took up the object of his pursuit&#146;. <span class="italic">Arctic Zoology</span> was written as a series of excursions north from Britain and drew upon correspondents with local knowledge such as George Low who contributed information on the birds of Orkney as well as upon the researches of Pallas in Siberia and of Joseph Banks in Newfoundland. It was one of the first major studies of the zoology of the northern hemisphere and was widely acclaimed: French and German editions appeared in 1787 and 1789. Pennant was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1791 for his contribution to American zoology.<h2>
<a name="Pennantstour"></a>Pennant's tour</h2>In 1769 Pennant undertook a tour of Scotland, chiefly of the highlands, a region then little known by outsiders yet of interest for its natural history. He again drew upon local specialist knowledge&#151;men such as the Revd Dr John Walker, who had travelled extensively in the highlands and Hebrides in 1764 and 1766, and, in Aberdeen, the natural historian David Skene, who showed Pennant his cabinet of natural history and advised him on zoological and botanical specimens. Pennant's <span class="italic">A Tour in Scotland, 1769</span>, was published in 1771. It is of interest for its descriptions and for its method: Pennant circulated &#145;Queries, addressed to the Gentlemen and Clergy of North-Britain&#146; [Scotland] with standard questions about natural history and the past and present state of the parish in order to allow locals to give &#145;a fuller and more satisfactory Account of their Country, than it is the Power of a Stranger and transient Visitant to give&#146;  (Pennant, <span class="italic">Tour in Scotland</span>, 287). In that regard Pennant has much in common with the earlier use of circulated queries by natural philosophers such as Robert Boyle and, in Scotland, by the natural historian and geographer Sir Robert Sibbald, and Pennant importantly prefigures the parish-based assessment of Scotland published by Sir John Sinclair in the 1790s.<br>
<br>Motivated by favourable critical reaction to his 1769 <span class="italic">Tour</span>, by the fact that his first Scottish work made no mention of the Hebrides, and, as he tells us, &#145;in order to render more complete, my preceding tour: and to allay that species of restlessness that infects many minds, on leaving any attempt unfinished&#146;, Pennant undertook a second tour of Scotland in 1772  (Pennant, <span class="italic">Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides</span>, i). His 1772 tour was more meticulously organized than the 1769 tour, which had been a largely impromptu event, though both involved the use of pre-circulated queries and advance notices in the Scottish press of Pennant's intentions. In 1772 he was accompanied by travelling companions, each with particular skills: the Revd John Lightfoot, a botanist, and later author of <span class="italic">Flora Scotica</span> (1777), a study on Linnaean principles of Scotland's native flora; the Revd John Stuart, minister of Killin parish and a Gaelic scholar; and Moses Griffith, Pennant's personal draughtsman, whom Pennant referred to as &#145;My Treasure&#146; and &#145;a good and faithful servant, and able artist&#146;  (Pennant, <span class="italic">Literary Life</span>, 10). Pennant used Joseph Banks's description of Staffa for his work and dedicated the book to Banks. Stuart, together with other local ministers, assisted Pennant with Gaelic names of plants. Griffith and Pennant remained close: a bequest in Pennant's will provided for Griffith's children and Pennant's son, David, awarded Griffith a pension.<br>
<br>Pennant's 1772 <span class="italic">Tour in Scotland</span> (1774&#150;6) was, like his 1769 tour, published by John Monk of Chester. It is best understood as a complement to his earlier Scottish work and the culmination of a longer enterprise designed to describe and understand Scotland. The aim of the Scottish tours was identical with that of geographies of more distant unknown lands such as the south sea islands.<br>
<br>Public reaction to Pennant's Scottish tours, as to his works of natural history, was generally favourable. The <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> considered his 1769 <span class="italic">Tour</span> &#145;the best itinerary which has hitherto been written on that country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, Jan 1772, 28). The first volume of Pennant's 1772 <span class="italic">Tour</span> influenced Samuel Johnson, then engaged in writing his own <span class="italic">Journey</span>, just as the 1769 work had been a prompt to Johnson's Hebridean travels with Boswell. Boswell recorded Johnson's defence of Pennant whose account of Alnwick and of the Percy estates in Northumberland was the subject of criticism by Thomas Percy, future bishop of Dromore, who felt slighted that Pennant had called his patron's garden &#145;trim&#146;. Johnson termed Pennant &#145;A Whig, Sir; a sad dog&#146;, yet at the same moment remarked &#145;But he's the best traveller I ever read; he observes more things than anyone else does&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 3.274, 12 April 1778). Boswell thought this too high praise for someone:<blockquote>who traversed a wide extent of such currency in such haste, that he could put together only curt frittered fragments of his own &hellip; a writer, who at best treats merely of superficial objects, and shews no philosophical investigation of character and manners. (ibid.)</blockquote>Both Boswell and Horace Walpole thought Pennant's work further diminished by his reliance upon others' information.<h2>
<a name="Moretoursandtravels"></a>More tours and travels</h2>Pennant undertook several other tours: of northern England in 1773, of Northamptonshire and of the Isle of Man in 1774, of Warwickshire in 1776, of Kent in 1776, and of Cornwall in 1787. Several tours throughout Wales in the early 1770s, where his Welsh-speaking friend and companion, the Revd John Lloyd of Caerwys, performed the same function as Stuart had in Gaelic Scotland, were brought together as <span class="italic">Tours in Wales</span> in three volumes (1778&#150;83).<br>
<br>Pennant's second marriage, in Whitford in January 1777, was to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1802), elder daughter of Sir Thomas Mostyn, fourth baronet (<i>d</i>. 1758), and sister of Sir Roger Mostyn, fifth baronet (1758&#150;1796), a prominent landowner in north Wales and friend to Pennant. Two children were born from this marriage: Sarah (1779&#150;1794) and Thomas (1780&#150;1845), a minister at Weston Turville, Buckinghamshire, who died childless.<br>
<br>Pennant's many travels to London were published as <span class="italic">A Journey from Chester to London</span> in 1782. Other tours were edited by his son David, and published posthumously: <span class="italic">A Journey from London to the Isle of Wight</span> (1801); <span class="italic">A Tour from Downing to Alston Moor</span> (1801); and <span class="italic">A Tour from Alston Moor to Harrowgate and Brimham Crags</span> (1804). Other publications include his <span class="italic">Of the Patagonians</span>, taken from the testimony of a Jesuit missionary, Falkener, who had spent thirty-eight years in that region and whom Pennant visited in Worcester in 1771, and, in 1790, <span class="italic">An Account of London</span>, which took the form of a tour around the capital: Boswell rated it highly.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Two of the three publications written towards the end of Pennant's life exemplify both his energy and the range of his writings. <span class="italic">The History of the Parishes of Whiteford and Holywell</span> (1796) offers a detailed local history and genealogical information on the Pennant family. His <span class="italic">Outlines of the Globe</span>, published in four volumes between 1798 and 1800 with volumes three and four being produced by his son David, was the only published outcome of twenty-two manuscript volumes of imaginary travels throughout the world. The first two volumes focused upon Hindustan and, although works of imagination, drew upon his knowledge of India and the writings of the explorer James Rennell. The title of the third, <span class="italic">The Literary Life of the Late Thomas Pennant Esq., by himself</span> (1793), hints at Pennant's sense of humour. It is signed only by dotted lines to indicate the death of the author: it is for that reason that his <span class="italic">History of the Parishes</span> is signed &#145;RESURGAM&#146;, with its implication of literary resurrection.<br>
<br>Pennant's <span class="italic">Literary Life</span>, which has several of his shorter works collected as appendices, makes clear his immense industry and the fact that his natural history writing and travelling were undertaken while fulfilling other responsibilities: he was high sheriff of Flintshire in 1761; author of pamphlets on road management and the militia laws; chairman in 1792 of the Flintshire Loyalist Association; and from 1763 improver of his own estates. Reflecting &#145;upon the multiplicity of my publications&#146;, he attributed his output to &#145;the riding exercise of my extensive tours, to my manner of living, and to my temperance&#146;  (Pennant, <span class="italic">Literary Life</span>, 35). He was much saddened by the death of his daughter, Sarah, in May 1794, and on 6 April 1795 he broke his kneecap which confined him to bed for six weeks. After prolonged breathing difficulties, he died at Downing on 16 December 1798.<br>
<br>Pennant's travels and natural history are distinguished by his personal energy, a keen observational sense, and by methodological organization and attention to facts. In such ways, and in his friendship and widespread correspondence with others of like interests throughout Britain and Europe, he may be said to exemplify those gentleman scholars of nature in the later eighteenth century whose interests in natural knowledge aimed at national improvement through intellectual enquiry. While he is perhaps better remembered for his Scottish tours, his <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> and <span class="italic">Arctic Zoology</span> in particular were important pioneering works and established him in the eyes of contemporaries as a leading European natural historian. For one modern scholar Pennant should be considered &#145;the leading British zoologist after Ray and before Darwin&#146;  (Beer, vi).<br>
