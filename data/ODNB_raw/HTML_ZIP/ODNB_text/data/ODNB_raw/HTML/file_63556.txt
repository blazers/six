<span class="headword">Das family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1750&#150;<em>c.</em>1820), <span class="occ">bankers in India</span>, known in the later days of its influence as the Shah family, were Purbiya or eastern Agarwals. Agarwals were one of the main communities of commercial castes indigenous to northern India. With the decline of the Mughal central government after 1707, Agarwal and Khattri financiers became more important, and the previously dominant Gujaratis declined. The family firm appears to have originated in the small town of Amroha, near Delhi, and to have moved to the pilgrimage and commercial centre of Benares in northern India in the seventeenth century. According to one tradition the family rose to importance as a member of the Naupatti (or group of &#145;nine sharers&#146;) who helped the city of Benares pay off a large forced loan to the nawab of Oudh.<br>
<br>This cross-caste association of families hereafter played an important role in financing and advising Balwant Singh and Chet Singh, rajas of Benares. They took farms of land revenue from the rulers, moved specie from Benares to Lucknow (and later Calcutta), and financed the burgeoning pilgrim traffic. At some point in the later eighteenth century the Bhaiaram family settled in a large <i>haveli</i>, or mansion, in the Chaukhamba district of Benares, close to the holiest of the sites for ritual bathing on the banks of the Ganges. They also played an important part in the patronage of the Vallabhacharya Hindu temples of the locality.<br>
<br>In the mid-eighteenth century the firm's principal was <a name="cosubject_75042"></a><span class="headword">Bhaiaram Das</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1750&#150;1770), <span class="occ">banker (mahajan) and money dealer (sarraff, or shroff)</span>. Despite directing some fifty-two branches of his house throughout northern India, Bhaiaram Das remains a shadowy figure. His son <a name="cosubject_63556"></a><span class="headword">Gopal Das</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1787)<span class="occ"></span>, along with a second son, Bhavani Das, began to figure prominently in the East India Company records when, after 1769, the British received the grant of the revenues of Benares from the nawab of Oudh, Asaf ud-Daula. In succession to his father, Gopal Das became the principal of the firm, now renamed Bhaiaram Gopal Das, during the period when the East India Company was consolidating its power in the post-Mughal kingdom of Oudh.<br>
<br>The Benares bankers, and the Naupatti in particular, became intermediaries in the remittance of the Benares revenue to the East India Company's treasury in Calcutta. They also helped move company funds from Lucknow to Calcutta and from Calcutta to Bombay via the city of Surat. These funds provided the financial muscle behind the military power of the East India Company. Despite this, Bhaiaram and the other bankers appear initially to have been regarded as impediments to the growth of British influence in Benares. After the revolt and expulsion of Maharaja Chet Singh in 1781, when the commercial wealth of the city generally rallied behind the company, the firm fully came to terms with the British presence. Gopal Das died in 1787 and the business passed to his son <a name="cosubject_63557"></a><span class="headword">Manohar Das</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1780&#150;1800)<span class="occ"></span>; Gopal Das was survived by his wife, of whom further details are unknown.<br>
<br>During the period when Jonathan Duncan was resident at the Benares court (1787&#150;95), Manohar Das was regularly interviewed on the movements of money markets across India and on political developments bearing on the company's finances. These reports were sent on to Calcutta and London. Gopal Das Manohar Das (as the firm was now titled) purchased large quantities of company paper in 1787&#150;90 and aided it during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. It had opened further <i>kothis</i>, or branches, at Cuttack, in central eastern India, and latterly at Madras, thus contributing to the creation of a network of indigenous financial support for the British across the whole subcontinent. Manohar Das was succeeded by his son Mukund Lal, under whom the firm's fortunes began to falter. During the opening decades of the nineteenth century the family declined in importance as a commercial interest, edged aside by newcomers and by British banks. By mid-century some family members had secured <i>zamindaris</i>, or landholdings, in the Benares region, and a few had entered the new professions, though others had fallen into poverty. Their history reveals, nevertheless, the extent to which the rise of the East India Company depended on Indian occupational &eacute;lites through to the time of the later Indian middle class.<br>
