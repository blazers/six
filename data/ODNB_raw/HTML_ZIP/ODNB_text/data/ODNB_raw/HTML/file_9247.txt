<span class="headword">Feild,  Edward</span>  (1801&#150;1876), <span class="occ">bishop of Newfoundland</span>, was born on 7 June 1801 in Worcester, the third son of James Feild, surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth. After attending school in Bewdley he went in 1814 to Rugby School, where he gained distinction in Latin composition. In 1819 he matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, and moved to Queen's College as an exhibitioner in 1820, graduating BA in 1823. In 1825 he became a Michel fellow at Queen's College and, under the influence of Dr Lloyd, the regius professor of divinity who also taught Pusey and Newman, sought ordination. He proceeded to an MA in 1826 and from 1827 combined teaching and acting as a public examiner with a curacy at Kidlington, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>As curate of Kidlington, Feild reformed the Sunday school and friendly society, began a system of allotments on church land, spoke out against machine breaking, and gave evidence to the royal commission on the poor law (reports commissioners, appendix B (i), 1834, 34.376e). He raised money to build a school with one of the first infant sections in England, and soon attracted visitors to study his educational methods and organization.<br>
<br>In 1834 Feild became rector of English Bicknor, Gloucestershire, where his efforts so impressed the National Society that when it wished to ward off state inspection of its schools it proceeded to appoint him as its first inspector. His many published reports on the state of parochial education in the dioceses of Salisbury and Worcester (London, 1841) urged attention to the physical environment of schools, attacked the Madras system, and criticized mechanical learning by rote. These reports were widely discussed within the Church of England, and particularly impressed Bishop Blomfield.<br>
<br>On the strength of his work at Kidlington, Blomfield approached Feild to become bishop of Newfoundland, a post which he accepted, being consecrated on 28 April 1844 at Lambeth. Feild served as bishop from his arrival in Newfoundland in 1844 until 1876, despite being considered for the see of Lincoln in 1851 and being offered the bishopric of Montreal in 1868. His approach to the new diocese was firmly high-church, his doctrine being based on the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> as interpreted in a Catholic light: an early sermon, for example, was entitled <span class="italic">God Glorified in his Saints</span> (1846). He was unresponsive to public pressure from low-church protestants and warned the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) that any of its missionaries who denied the doctrine of baptismal regeneration in Newfoundland would be promptly suspended. Contemporary evangelicals attacked him in <span class="italic">The Record</span> (8 June 1854) as &#145;an ultra-Tractarian of the Exeter school&#146; and Methodist ministers were upset by his denial of the validity of their holy orders, even though he was personally helpful to individual ministers who were short of money. He was thought by some to be &#145;wanting in Christian charity towards ministers of other denominations&#146;  (Senior, 281) for his uncompromising attitudes to church doctrine and discipline in a diocese which had, until his arrival, been dominated by low-church tendencies.<br>
<br>Another cause of Feild's initial unpopularity in St John's was his approach to the thorny question of church finance. Feild's solution was to oblige the clergy, amid great opposition, not to rely on subsidies from the SPG but to collect money for their support directly from parishioners, a measure which left many clergyman in serious poverty. Hoping that &#145;two or three might be found who would be ready to endure hardness for these poor fisherman [of Newfoundland] and for Christ's sake&#146;  (Senior, 280) he called those willing &#145;to undertake a mission of peculiar difficulty or privation, with no prospect of worldly preferment or recompense&#146;  (USPG, C/Can/Nfl 7, Feild to Hawkins, 9 Oct 1845). Realizing that he had little hope of attracting many educated middle-class candidates, he set out to attract working-class hopefuls by providing, in his newly established Queen's College, St John's (1850), not only theological training but also a general education which might widen their opportunities. Throughout his diocese he built Gothic revival churches, the cathedral being copied from a design by Gilbert Scott; although the foundation-stone had been laid as early as 1843 it was Feild who raised the necessary &pound;15,000, mainly from churches in England, to see the cathedral's opening in 1850. When finally complete, several years later, it was thought one of the finest in North America.<br>
<br>Feild's diocese, including not only Newfoundland and the Labrador coast but also the Bermudas, covered a distance of about 1200 miles, and included territories with dramatically different needs and problems. He consequently travelled a great deal, often in a specially purchased church ship (since the diocese lacked roads). His missionary journeys are described in a journal which was later published in various volumes of the <span class="italic">Church in the Colonies</span>. These, together with his numerous charges, several pamphlets and sermons, and many letters to the SPG and to his influential Tractarian friends in England, kept his activities in the public eye in England, and particularly in the mother church. He set up boys' and girls' schools and campaigned for thirty years for a distinctly Anglican rather than a loosely protestant state-subsidized system of schools. His success in 1875 was unique in the British colonies. Although he disapproved of clergymen taking an overt role in politics, in 1857 he defended the Newfoundland fisheries against French demands, and in 1861 his denunciation of the government contributed to its fall. In 1867 he began a thorough reorganization of the diocese, acquiring an assistant bishop, J. B. K. Kelly, and calling a general synod in 1871. On 30 April 1867 he married Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1908), widow of the Revd J. G. Mountain and daughter of Robert Bevan, a banker from Suffolk. Tough, resolute, with clear deep-set blue eyes and fair hair, his uncompromising attitudes to Catholics, Methodists, evangelicals and all those who were not of his own denomination made him heartily disliked at first, but his strong sense of principle, absence of malice, and personal warmth gradually won the affection and respect of the whole Christian community.<br>
<br>In Newfoundland, where sectarian feelings traditionally ran high and St John's was often compared with Belfast, the Tractarian bishop was an essential if unwitting element in the process which led to a relatively peaceful resolution of interdenominational conflicts. Through actions such as his refusal to support the Newfoundland branch of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1846, Feild split the unity of protestants. In asserting a high-church form of religion which local Methodists disliked even more than Roman Catholicism, he made it impossible for protestant ascendancy to be maintained amid a population which was more or less equally split between Methodists, Roman Catholics, and Anglicans. Feild's dislike of doctrinal compromise meant that he secured an agreement to share all state patronage on a strictly denominational basis and it was this safeguarding of each denomination's separate schools and economic interests which successfully kept the peace for many years. As well as inadvertently finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> for three mutually suspicious Christian denominations, Feild's insistence upon local autonomy in many financial matters helped to establish a secure basis for the diocese's future. His other important contribution was administrative: his reorganization of the diocese, increase in schools, churches, and the building of a cathedral and theological college meant that he left a more prosperous, efficient, and stable diocese than he had found thirty-two years before.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Feild was very healthy, but in 1875 overwork and a winter severe even by Newfoundland standards contributed to serious illness and he went to Bermuda to recuperate. On 8 June 1876 he died at Bishop's Court, Hamilton, Bermuda, and was buried on 11 June in the local cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
