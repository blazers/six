<span class="headword">Taylor,  Richard</span>  (1781&#150;1858), <span class="occ">printer and naturalist</span>, was born at Norwich, Norfolk, on 18 May 1781, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "John Taylor (1750&#150;1826)")</script>, wool factor, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27082/', "Susannah Taylor, n&#233;e Cook (1755&#150;1823)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27055/', "Taylor, John")</script>], and the great-grandson of the Presbyterian divine <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27046/', "John Taylor (1694&#150;1761)")</script>. He was educated at a Norwich dissenting day school run by the Revd John Houghton, where he acquired a good knowledge of the classics and the stimulus to acquire proficiency in French, Italian, Flemish, Old English, and their literatures. He remained a practising Unitarian throughout his life. In March 1797, on the recommendation of the botanist Sir James Edward Smith, he was apprenticed to the Unitarian printer Jonas Davis, in Chancery Lane, London. It was through the happy accident that Davis printed the Linnean Society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> and, from 1798, the independent <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, that Taylor became a printer and publisher of scientific books and periodicals.<br>
<br>In 1800 Davis abandoned printing, selling the business to John Taylor and Richard Wilks on the understanding that Richard Taylor would become a partner on reaching his majority. The partnership was dissolved in 1803 after violent quarrelling between Wilks and Richard Taylor, the firm becoming R. Taylor &amp; Co. A younger brother, Arthur (1790&#150;1870), was a partner from 1814 to 1823, and a nephew, John Edward Taylor (1809&#150;1866), from 1837 to 1851, by which time the firm was housed in Red Lion Court, Fleet Street. Its printing device, a roman lamp, and motto, <i>Alere flammam</i>, were first adopted in 1815.<br>
<br>Taylor was at the forefront of new printing technology and between 1809 and 1818 he partnered Richard Bensley, George Woodfall, and Friedrich Koenig in the development of Koenig's mechanized printing press. Taylor lost money in this venture. Although John Walter, the owner of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, bought two machines in 1814, Taylor had to deal with financial discord between Walter and the partners, devious behaviour by Bensley, insuperable technical problems, and the appearance of cheaper machines from competitors such as Augustus Applegarth. Only after 1828, when Taylor contracted to print the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span> on his own cylindrical press, did his firm become financially secure.<br>
<br>On 7 April 1807 Taylor married Hannah Corke of St Paul's, Covent Garden. Their only daughter, Sarah, was born in 1808. It was not a successful marriage, and Taylor fell in love with Sarah Taylor's governess, Frances Marshall Francis (1797&#150;1854), described at her death as the &#145;widow of Richard Francis, printer&#146;. There were two illegitimate children, William (1817&#150;1904) and Rachel Francis (1820&#150;1913). Despite Hannah's likely death in the 1830s, Taylor never legitimized Frances's position, his real relationship with their children being kept a closely guarded family secret that scandalized his distinguished brothers John (1779&#150;1863) and Edward (1784&#150;1863) in 1852, when William Francis, who had studied chemistry and biology in Germany at Giessen and Berlin, was taken into partnership, the firm becoming Taylor and Francis.<br>
<br>From the beginning Taylor acquired a reputation for careful printing that ranged across poetry, fine editions of Old English classics, newspapers, textbooks, and examination papers. His chief interest, however, was science. In 1807 he became a fellow of the Linnean Society, and its under-secretary from 1810 to 1857. He was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Astronomical Society, and the Philological Society, as well as a regular supporter of the British Association from 1831. In 1822 he joined Alexander Tilloch as editor of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, and he was a founder editor of the <span class="italic">Annals of Natural History</span> in 1838. He also sponsored and edited five important volumes of translations, <span class="italic">Scientific Memoirs</span>, between 1837 and 1852. For thirty-five years he represented the ward of Farringdon Without on the common council of the City of London, where he played a particularly active role in educational matters such as the founding of the City of London School and the Guildhall Library.<br>
<br>On suffering a nervous breakdown in 1852, Taylor retired to Richmond, Surrey, where he died from bronchitis at his home, Alton Lodge, on 1 December 1858. He was buried in St Peter's churchyard, Petersham, Surrey. The printing and publishing house was continued by William Francis.<br>
