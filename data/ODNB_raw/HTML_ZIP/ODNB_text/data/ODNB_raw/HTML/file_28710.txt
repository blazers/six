<span class="headword">Ward,  William</span>  (1769&#150;1823), <span class="occ">missionary in India and journalist</span>, born at Derby on 20 October 1769, was the son of John Ward, a carpenter and builder of that town, and grandson of Thomas Ward, a farmer at Stretton, near Burton in Staffordshire. His father died while William was a child, and the care of his upbringing devolved on his mother, a woman of great energy of character and of exemplary Methodist piety. He was placed with a schoolmaster named Congreve, near Derby, and afterwards with another named Breary. On leaving school he was bound apprentice to a printer and bookseller of Derby named John Drewry, with whom he continued two years after the expiry of his indentures, assisting him to edit the <span class="italic">Derby Mercury</span> and in due course editing the paper himself. In 1794 or 1795 he moved to Stafford, where he assisted Joshua Drewry, a relative of his former master, to edit the <span class="italic">Staffordshire Advertiser</span>. At the end of 1795 he proceeded to Hull, where he followed his business as a printer, and was for nine months in 1796 editor of the <span class="italic">Hull Advertiser and Exchange Gazette</span>.<br>
<br>Ward began to attend a Baptist church, probably between 1791 and 1793, and on 28 August 1796, after many troubles of heart&#151;&#145;fierce volcano fires not to be quenched by a mere sprinkling of words&#146;&#151;he was baptized at Hull. Preaching constantly in the neighbouring villages, he became known as a man of promise, and, with the assistance of a member of the Baptist community named Fishwick, he proceeded in August 1797 to Ewood Hall, near Halifax in Yorkshire, the theological academy of John Fawcett (1740&#150;1817), where he studied for a year and a half. In the autumn of 1798 a member of the committee of the newly founded Baptist Missionary Society visited Ewood, and Ward offered himself as a missionary, influenced perhaps by a remark made to him in 1793 by William Carey (1761&#150;1834) concerning the need of a printer in the Indian mission field. He sailed from England in the <i>Criterion</i> in May 1799, in company with Joshua Marshman, Daniel Brunsdon, William Grant, and their families. On arriving at Calcutta the party was prevented from joining Carey by an order from the East India Company government, and was obliged to proceed to the Danish settlement of Serampore, where they were joined by Carey. On 10 May 1802 Ward was married at Serampore to Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tidd, widow of John Fountain, a Baptist missionary. They had two sons and two daughters, but only two of the children survived.<br>
<br>In India Ward's time was chiefly occupied in superintending the printing press, by means of which the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, translated into Bengali, Marathi, Hindi, and more than twenty other languages, was disseminated throughout India. Numerous philological works were also issued. Ward found time, however, to keep a copious journal and to preach the gospel to the Hindus. Until 1806 he made frequent tours among the towns and villages of the province, but after that year the increasing claims of the press on his time, and the extension of the missionary labours in Serampore and Calcutta, prevented him quitting headquarters. In 1812 the printing office was destroyed by fire. It contained the types of all the scriptures that had been printed, to the value of at least &pound;10,000. The moulds for casting fresh type, however, were recovered from the debris, and by the liberality of friends in Great Britain the loss was soon repaired.<br>
<br>In 1819 Ward, having been for some time in bad health, revisited England. He was entrusted with the task of pleading for funds with which to endow a college at Serampore for the purpose of instructing Bengalis in European literature and science. He undertook a series of journeys through England and Scotland, and also visited Holland and north Germany. In October 1820 he embarked for New York and travelled through the United States, returning to England in April 1821. On 28 May he sailed for India in the <i>Abberton</i> bearing &pound;3000 for the new college, which had been founded during his absence and which still survives.<br>
<br>Ward was the author of a number of publications, of which much the most important was his <span class="italic">Account of the Writings, Religion, and Manners of the Hindoos</span>, the first volume of which was published by the Serampore mission press in 1806. The complete four-volume edition first appeared in 1811. A one-volume abridged version edited by W. O. Simpson was published as late as 1863. In the later editions the title was changed to <span class="italic">View of the History, Literature, and Religion of the Hindoos</span>. Although Ward did not mince his words in his condemnation of &#145;Hindoo idolatry&#146;, he did comment favourably on the literary and philological achievements of Hindu scholars, and in later versions modified somewhat the harshness of his strictures on Hinduism. Despite some serious inaccuracies, Ward's work remains without parallel as a detailed account by a European observer of Hindu society and religion in early nineteenth-century Bengal. Ward died of cholera at Serampore on 7 March 1823, and was interred in the mission burial-ground there.<br>
