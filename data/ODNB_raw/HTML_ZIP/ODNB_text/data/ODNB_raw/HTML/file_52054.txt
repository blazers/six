<span class="headword">Mayall,  John Jabez Edwin</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jabez Meal]</span>  (1813&#150;1901), <span class="occ">photographer and local politician</span>, was born on 17 September 1813 at Oldham, Lancashire, as Jabez Meal, the son of John Meal, a west Yorkshire manufacturing chemist, and his wife, Elizabeth. Virtually nothing is known of his early life. Although local tradition in his home town of Lingard, near Huddersfield, held that he followed his father into chemistry, the 1841 census listed him and his wife as flax spinners. Some time shortly after this he travelled to the United States, apparently then altering his name, which was probably of French origin. After a period in New York, he settled in Philadelphia, and it was there with the new art of daguerreotypy that Mayall made his reputation.<br>
<br>Late in life Mayall recalled that his first handling of a daguerreotype was on 6 January 1840; the circumstances and the precision of the date cannot be confirmed. Whether or not he had some experience in the new art before moving to America is unknown, but he must have been well informed, for he promptly established a close working relationship with two University of Pennsylvania chemists active in perfecting the daguerreotype process, Professor Hans Martin Boy&eacute; and Dr Paul Beck Goddard. In 1843&#150;4 Mayall made a series of ten daguerreotypes illustrating the Lord's prayer, an allegorical excursion of a type previously almost unknown to the rough new art: these brought him wide acclaim for some years, but are now thought to be lost. Mayall joined another Englishman, Samuel Van Loan, in partnership in a Philadelphia daguerreotype studio, and by 1844 the Franklin Institute had awarded them a silver medal for their daguerreotype productions. In 1845 Mayall became the sole proprietor, using the name Professor Highschool, and on 20 June 1846 he sold the studio to Marcus A. Root (who was to become one of the most successful American daguerreotypists) and returned to England. There is some evidence that Mayall was facing legal difficulties over his method of hand colouring daguerreotypes and perhaps this prompted his departure.<br>
<br>When Mayall moved to London he worked briefly for Antoine Claudet, another pioneering daguerreotypist, but by 1847 he had set up his own studio, the American Daguerreotype Institution, at 433 Strand. It was at the Great Exhibition in 1851 that Mayall's reputation was firmly established; he was popularly believed to be an American. His seventy-two daguerreotypes, many of them from his days in America, received an honourable mention from the jurors and attracted the attention of Prince Albert, an enthusiastic patron of photography. He invited Mayall to photograph the queen and other members of the royal family and the resulting cartes-de-visite were widely popular. The queen, too, mistook his nationality: on being photographed by him in 1855, she recorded in her journal that &#145;Mr. Mayall &hellip; is the oddest man I ever saw but an excellent photographer. He is an American and a tremendous enthusiast in his work&#146;  (H. Gernsheim and A. Gernsheim, <span class="italic">Queen Victoria</span>, 1959, 261). On being commanded to photograph the wedding of the prince and princess of Wales in 1863, Mayall erected a special glasshouse at Windsor for the purpose (he later moved it to Brighton and turned it into a conservatory). When the fledgeling Photographic Society started up in 1853, John Edwin Mayall (as he had come to be known) was already a portrait photographer of the highest reputation and he immediately became an active participant. He was beginning to demonstrate his leadership in other ways. In common with most photographers, Mayall had by then abandoned daguerreotypy for the wet collodion negative process freely introduced by Frederick Scott Archer. He recognized the professional photographic community's debt to Archer and led the efforts to secure Archer, and then his widow, financial independence; Mayall was the largest single contributor to the Archer Testimonial Fund.<br>
<br>Although he continued his London studio, Mayall had become increasingly interested in Brighton, and in 1863 set up on its busy seafront another studio, which he operated personally. His sense of innovation remained active, and he was one of the first to specialize in enlarging, making spectacular life-size prints (a fine portrait of George Peabody is still preserved in the Peabody Institute in Baltimore). In 1869 Mayall became the first person to travel from London to Brighton on a velocipede. In 1881 his London studio began using electric light to illuminate its portraits.<br>
<br>On 23 June 1834, while still in Yorkshire, Mayall had married Eliza Parkin (1816&#150;1870); they had three sons and a daughter. The oldest son, Edwin, took over the London studio when his parents moved to Brighton. Another son, John, became increasingly important in the Brighton studio after 1865. The 1870s marked many changes for Mayall, in addition to gradually ceding control of his studios to his children. On 14 December 1871&#151;a year after the death of his first wife&#151;he married a widow, Celia Victoria Hooper (<i>bap</i>. 1839), daughter of William Gardener, a surgeon, and with her had two more daughters and another son. In 1871 Mayall was made a fellow of the Chemical Society and in 1872 gave a paper before the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. 1871 also marked the start of his political career, when he was elected a councillor for Brighton. In 1875 he became an alderman and in 1877&#150;8 he was mayor.<br>
<br>In total, Mayall and his sons operated ten studios in London (the last closed in 1941), four in Brighton (until 1908), one in Kingston upon Thames, and three in Melbourne, Australia. To the confusion over his nationality was added that over the use of his name: it is often difficult, if not impossible, to determine in particular cases if John Edwin Mayall was actually the photographer or just the famous figure behind the studio name. The name of Mayall did not die with him at The Bures, Southwick, near Brighton, on 6 March 1901.<br>
