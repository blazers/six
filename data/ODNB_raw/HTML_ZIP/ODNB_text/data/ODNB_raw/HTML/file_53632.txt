<span class="headword">Statham,  Henry Heathcote</span>  (1839&#150;1924), <span class="occ">architectural writer and journal editor</span>, was born at Everton, Lancashire, on 11 January 1839, the eldest son of Henry Heathcote Statham, a solicitor, and his wife, Irene Elisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Horner. The journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94124/', "Francis Reginald Statham")</script> was his younger brother. He was educated at Liverpool Collegiate Institution and trained as an architect in the office of George Williams of Liverpool; he became secretary of the Liverpool Architectural Society in 1866. The passion of his early years was for music, particularly the organ, and he received advice from W. T. Best, the organist at St George's Hall, Liverpool. Statham practised briefly as an architect in Liverpool but in the early 1870s was invited by George Godwin&#151;the editor of <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, a leading weekly architectural magazine&#151;to move to London and devote himself to writing. Apart from <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, his literary work included articles for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, <span class="italic">The Fortnightly</span>, and the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span>, on musical and literary questions, written lucidly but with forthright opinions, including a strong aversion to the music of Richard Wagner.<br>
<br>Statham succeeded Godwin as editor in 1883 and retired in 1908. He became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1871 and a fellow in 1878. He made designs for architectural competitions, such as the refronting of the National Gallery, London, the layout of Trafalgar Square, and the redesign of Thames bridges. Statham designed a new front for the offices of <span class="italic">The Builder</span> and other small works. He would often spend boxing day drawing an architectural fantasy for publication in <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, based on a passage of poetry, often Browning, whose <span class="italic">Sordello</span> he was able to quote extensively. He married on 17 February 1887 Florence Elizabeth Dicken, daughter of William Stephen Dicken, with whom he had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Statham's work as an editor was valued for raising the cultural level of architecture by his quality of thought and language. He stood aside from contemporary debate about style, representing a conservative viewpoint and an appreciation of the structural logic of French architecture. In his writings on architecture, such as <span class="italic">A Short Critical History of Architecture</span> (1912), he stressed universal themes of construction and symbolism rather than the opposing characteristics of different styles and periods. He expressed his dissatisfaction with current trends in <span class="italic">Modern Architecture</span> (1897). His contribution on &#145;Modern architecture&#146; (from 1800) to the article &#145;Architecture&#146; in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1910) was a lively summary of the international scene, biased towards an artistic expression of classicism.<br>
<br>Statham did not abandon his musical career. He played the organ at St Luke's, Whitechapel, for many years for Canon Henry Barnett, and gave recitals of Bach in the East End. In 1879 and for at least two subsequent years, on the recommendation of George Godwin, he voluntarily played for Sunday afternoon recitals at the Albert Hall, London, and attracted an audience of 4000. His repertory was based on Bach, Handel, and Mendelssohn. He died at Torbay Hospital, Devon, on 29 May 1924.<br>
