<span class="headword">Minorsky, Vladimir Fyodorovich</span>  (1877&#150;1966), <span class="occ">orientalist and Persian scholar</span>, the son of Fyodor M. Minorsky and his wife, Olga, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Golubitskaya, was born on 5 February 1877 at Korcheva, on the upper Volga to the north-west of Moscow. He was educated at Moscow University from 1896 to 1903, studying law and oriental languages. In 1903 he entered the imperial Russian ministry of foreign affairs, serving in Persia, St Petersburg, central Asia, and Turkey. He represented Russia on the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, and eventually became charg&eacute; d'affaires at the Russian legation in Tehran. In 1913 he married Tatyana Shebunina (<i>d</i>. 27 Dec 1987); their only son died in 1950. With the Russian Revolution, Minorsky and his wife settled in Paris. Moving from an official and diplomatic career to an academic one, in 1923 he became lecturer in Persian at the &Eacute;cole des Langues Orientales Vivantes in Paris. In 1932 he began teaching at the School of Oriental Studies, London, where in 1937 he became professor of Persian. The school was evacuated to Cambridge during the first part of the Second World War, and the Minorskys settled there permanently after he retired in 1944. He died at Cambridge on 25 March 1966 at the age of eighty-nine, still in the plenitude of his intellectual powers, and in 1969 his ashes were interred in the cemetery of the Novodevichye monastery at Moscow. He had by the time of his death received many honours from academies and universities of Europe and Asia, including the triennial gold medal of the Royal Asiatic Society, London.<br>
<br>Minorsky was a scholar of outstanding calibre, who dominated historical, topographical, and ethnological studies in the Turco-Persian regions of western Asia and beyond as the worthy successor of his compatriot V. V. Bartold and the German Josef Markwart. The focus of his interests was Persia and the Iranian cultural world in general, including component peoples such as the Kurds, Armenians, and Afghans. But he was also interested in adjacent regions such as the Caucasus and Turkish central Asia. Much of his work, and especially that in the fields of historical geography and ethnography, was informed by personal experience; thus he had surveyed on horseback the whole 700 miles of the Turco-Persian frontier from the Persian Gulf to Mount Ararat as part of his delimitation duties of 1913&#150;14. His <i>magnum opus</i> was the <span class="italic">Hud&#363;d al-&#145;&#257;lam. &#145;The Regions of the World&#146;</span> (1936), a medieval Persian geography which he translated with a commentary of amazing complexity and insight. Other works included a translation and edition of an Arabic work, <span class="italic">Sharaf al-Zam&#257;n T&#257;hir Marvaz&#299; on China, the Turks and India</span> (1942), dealing with the ethnography and history of inner, south, and east Asia; a facsimile edition of and commentary on a Safavid Persian manual of administration (1944); two books on the history of the Caucasus (1953, 1958); an edition and translation of a work by a tenth-century Arab traveller in Persia (1955); and an abridged translation of a history of the Turkmen dynasties of Persia in the fifteenth century. His aesthetic sensibilities (he had, among other interests, a great love of music and was himself a pianist) showed themselves in works on Persian art. He had been oriental secretary for the Persian Art Exhibition of 1930&#150;31 in London, and contributed to the exhibition catalogue; later he produced two books on Turkish and Persian miniature painters and calligraphers (1958, 1959). All this was in addition to hundreds of articles, many of them studies of major significance; some of these were in the further field of Persian literature.<br>
<br>Minorsky was a kindly and hospitable person, ever ready to encourage younger scholars; in his later years, his stocky figure gave him something of the appearance of a genial teddy bear. As a teacher he was better with individuals than with larger groups. He saw his own scholarly task as the recovery and elucidation of information about regions whose history, topography, and ethnology were often profoundly obscure. He did not think that the groundwork had yet been done for more general works of synthesis, as was possible for historians of Europe. Noteworthy, too, was his firm Russian patriotism, even though events had compelled him to spend the second half of his life outside his native country.<br>
