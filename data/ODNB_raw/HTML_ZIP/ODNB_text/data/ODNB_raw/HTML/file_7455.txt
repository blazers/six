<span class="headword">Delavall, Sir  Ralph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1707), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the eldest son of William Delavall (1616&#150;1667) of Newcastle and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of Sir Peter Riddell of Newcastle. Delavall was probably educated locally and his spelling in later life was bad and phonetic. He was appointed lieutenant of the <i>Cambridge</i> on 23 August 1666 and served in the <i>Henrietta</i> from October 1666 to December 1667 before being appointed a lieutenant on the <i>Tiger</i> from March 1668 to May 1669. As part of retrenchment he was then dismissed, and not employed again until January 1671 when he was appointed lieutenant of the <i>Adventure</i>. In January 1672 he moved to the <i>Advice</i> as lieutenant, but seems to have missed the battle of Solebay on 28 May 1672 as the <i>Advice</i> had been sent out cruising. On 6 January the next year he was promoted to captain of the <i>Eagle</i> and ordered to sail to Guinea, so missing the battles of Schooneveld and the Texel. When he returned early in 1674 he was sent out with a convoy to Helsingor where he seized a Dutch cannon. When asked why he had seized the Dutch property, Delavall replied that the Dutch were &#145;professed Enemies to my Nation and that my Prince had declared them to be so, it was my duty to do them all the prejudice I could&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 51/4177/1, <i>Eagle</i>). When Delavall returned to England he was among the captains dismissed from the service at the end of the Third Anglo-Dutch War and in December 1674 he was commissioned a lieutenant in the regiment of foot guards; in 1685 he was promoted to captain and in 1687 to lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Delavall was appointed captain of the <i>Constant Warwick</i> on 9 April 1677, having been given permission to leave his regiment. In June 1677 he clashed with Balthazar St Michel, muster-master at Deal, over his refusal to sign the ship's muster-books, Delavall &#145;alleging his not being enjoined thereto by his instructions&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 106/326, fols. 238&#150;9; Cat. iv 446). Delavall was in the West Indies in 1678; he had returned to England by May the next year, when he appeared before the parliamentary committee investigating miscarriage in the navy, concerning his seizing several ships on the pretence of their trading to Guinea. He also had to justify his religion, as it had been publicly suggested he was a Roman Catholic. He was discharged from his commission in July 1679 and rejoined the foot guards.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1688 Delavall was appointed captain of the <i>York</i>. He told the Navy Board on 3 November 1688 that he had not yet fitted his ship out because Portsmouth was &#145;barren of saylers &hellip; esteeming myself extremely unfortunate under this unhappy delay&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 106/383, fol. 275). As part of the fleet commanded by Arthur Herbert he took part in the battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689. A year later, on 31 May 1690, he presented a loyal address from the fleet to the queen, who knighted him. Promoted to vice-admiral of the blue he raised his flag in the <i>Coronation</i> and commanded the Blue squadron, the rear squadron at the battle of Beachy Head on 30 June 1690: he and his squadron fought the French for five hours and at the inquiry made by the lords commissioners sent to investigate the action he blamed the large Dutch losses on the Dutch themselves. Delavall was allegedly no friend of Torrington's and was president of Torrington's court martial in December 1690 (which acquitted him).<br>
<br>From the end of 1690 until the summer of 1691 Delavall commanded a powerful squadron in the channel, cruising off Dunkirk and attacking the port. He captured a French ship and seized papers relating to Viscount Preston's plots in England, but as he could not understand French he did not know what he had found until one of his captains told him. In December 1691 he commanded a squadron off Cadiz and in January 1692 convoyed the Mediterranean Fleet to the straits and continued cruising in the channel to protect trade. In March 1692 when Delavall arrived at Plymouth he was said to have &pound;2.5 million of bullion aboard, though this was later said to be exaggerated. On 13 May, with his flag in the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, Delavall served under Russell as vice-admiral of the Red squadron, and at the battle of Barfleur/La Hougue he commanded the detached squadron which on 22 May burnt the <i>Soleil Royal</i> and two other French ships in Cherbourg. Afterwards Delavall complained bitterly and constantly about Russell's conduct before and after the battle. In November 1692 it was reported that Delavall had fallen off his horse while on his way to Portsmouth and had broken his arm. In 1693 Delavall, Killigrew, and Shovell were appointed jointly as admirals of the fleet. Following the loss of the merchant convoy destined for Smyrna, it was suggested that Killigrew and Delavall were acting in the interest of King James. Delavall bitterly denied this, declaring &#145;I &hellip; should be ashamed were I guilty of intended ill to my country&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1693</i>, 201). William none the less dismissed him from all his military offices, including his command of the 1st foot regiment, and he did not serve at sea again although in July 1693 he was appointed a prize commissioner for Jamaica and Barbados and promoted to admiral of the blue. Appointed an Admiralty commissioner in April 1693, Delavall, because of his service at sea, attended only two meetings. Following his dismissal as admiral later that year William ordered him not to attend any further meetings and he was removed at the next renewal in May 1694. At the end of 1694 Delavall kissed William's hand and it was said he would command the fleet in 1695, but this did not happen.<br>
<br>Delavall sat as MP for Great Bedwyn as a tory in 1695&#150;8. In 1699 he was granted a pension &#145;for good service at sea&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1699&#150;1700</i>, 197) and as admiral of the blue &#145;by a dormant commission&#146; he was included on a list presented to William on 30 March 1700 of flag officers &#145;unemployed at sea&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1700&#150;02</i>, 283). Delavall married Hester Major of London. They had at least four children, two sons who died young and two daughters, Hester and Mary, who survived him. He possibly retired to Seaton Delaval in Northumberland, and may have died in London at his house in St Margaret's Westminster. He was buried on 23 January 1707 in the upper end of the west aisle of Westminster Abbey; his wife died six months later, on 10 July.<br>
