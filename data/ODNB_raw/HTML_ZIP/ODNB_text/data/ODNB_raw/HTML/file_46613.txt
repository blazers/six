<span class="headword">Bedford,  John</span>  (1903&#150;1980), <span class="occ">department store manager</span>, was born on 16 January 1903 at 26 Court 6 New John Street, west Birmingham, the only son of John Bedford and his wife, Rosalind Nicholls. His father was a journeyman brass-caster who established his own small brass foundry, money from which was to be used to enable his son to enter the legal profession. Unfortunately, the business failed and his son was required to start work. He did so in a Birmingham department store, first as an assistant and later as a buyer. It was this experience that was to set his future career in the retail trade.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-nine Bedford became manager of the department store of J. C. Smiths in Stratford upon Avon after it had been taken over by Debenhams. Three years later he was put in charge of a newly acquired Debenhams store in Great Yarmouth. His management skills were to be fully tested three years after that, however, when he was appointed to run the Plymouth outlet, Spooners.<br>
<br>Managing the store during the difficulties of the war years, Bedford established a reputation as a dynamic business teacher. Spooners was one of the earliest buildings to be destroyed by German bombing, but Bedford quickly reopened in makeshift premises. He also played an active role in the Home Guard, firewatching, and in the eventual planning of the new store. In recognition of his wartime role Bedford was appointed a military MBE, as well as an OBE.<br>
<br>Bedford was to become a rapidly rising star in the Debenhams organization under the chairmanship of G. M. Wright. His useful experience of provincial store management was recognized in 1949, when he was sent to London to examine the difficulties of using Debenhams' fragmented buying power. Appointed a director, Bedford nevertheless continued for a time to run the Plymouth store as well as representing the board in Scotland.<br>
<br>The key problem facing Debenhams was its lack of co-ordination: the Debenhams group had grown through the haphazard acquisition of stores throughout the country, each of which retained its own name, purchasing policy, and distinctive identity. Bedford realized that Debenhams needed a more concerted strategy to respond to changes in consumer taste and spending power, and he managed to persuade the various factions in its organization to support some element of centralization in purchasing, stock control, and planning. One positive step towards integration was the decision that each department store should carry notices declaring that it was &#145;A Debenhams Store&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1954 Bedford was appointed deputy chairman, and then chairman and managing director two years later. He proved to be a tireless managing director who made regular visits to all the stores. Bedford was responsible for introducing a contributory pensions scheme for employees in 1957. When he reorganized the main Debenhams board of directors in the following year, Bedford secured the appointment of a number of younger figures (each of whom was to direct a group of stores, and also serve as chief executive of the principal store in that division).<br>
<br>Bedford undertook a strong expansionist policy that saw many new stores added to the group. One consequence was the much publicized and unsuccessful attempt to take over the Harrods group of department stores in 1959. Bedford later confessed that &#145;I do not like take-over bids, and I do not like the people who make them&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Aug 1959). He had only begun merger talks with Harrods after Sir Hugh Fraser had begun buying up its shares; nevertheless, he was bitterly disappointed when Fraser won over a majority of Harrods shareholders.<br>
<br>By nature a shy man who disliked personal publicity, Bedford was also a complex character who had strong personal beliefs. On 22 August 1927 he married Florence Mary, daughter of Aaron Illingworth Oddy; they had one daughter. A keen and active Methodist, Bedford for many years served as a lay preacher. In this role he occupied the pulpits of many of the small chapels in the Greater London area, and he was for some years a member of the Hinde Street Church in the West End of London. His greatest passion away from work, community service, and the church, however, was sport. As a young man he was keen on cricket and football, and in later years he moved to snooker, badminton, and golf.<br>
<br>In addition to his role at Debenhams, Bedford served as a director of the Commercial Union Insurance Company from 1952 to 1973, as well as serving on the executive council of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. In 1962 he served on the Banwell committee for the Ministry of Public Building and Works. He was also a director of London Transport.<br>
<br>Bedford gave up active managerial responsibilities in 1970, and stepped down as chairman early in 1971. He made a positive contribution to the reorganization of Debenhams, but its underlying problems were hard to resolve; and the positive effect of central buying and the closure of loss-making outlets only began to be felt after Bedford's departure. He died of prostate cancer on 11 November 1980 at his home, 23 Kepplestone, Staveley Road, Eastbourne, Sussex. He was survived by his wife.<br>
