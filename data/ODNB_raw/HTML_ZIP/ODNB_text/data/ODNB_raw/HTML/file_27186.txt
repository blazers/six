<span class="headword">Thirlwall,  (Newell) Connop</span>  (1797&#150;1875), <span class="occ">historian and bishop of St David's</span>, born in Mile End Old Town, London, on 11 February 1797, was the third son of the Revd Thomas Thirlwall, and his wife, Susannah Connop (<i>d</i>. 1842) of Mile End, the widow of an apothecary.<br>
<br>The father, <a name="cosubject_27186"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Thirlwall</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1827), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was the son of Thomas Thirlwall (<i>d</i>. 1808), vicar of Cottingham, near Hull, who claimed descent from the barons of Thirlwall Castle, Northumberland. The younger Thomas, after holding some small benefices in London, was presented in 1814 to the rectory of Bower's Gifford in Essex, where he died on 17 March 1827. He was a man of fervent piety, and the author of several published works, including <span class="italic">Diatessaron, seu, Integra historia domini nostri Jesu Christi, ex quatuor evangeliis confecta</span> (1802).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Connop Thirlwall showed such precocity that when he was only eleven years of age his father published a volume of his compositions called <span class="italic">Primitiae</span>, a work in after years so odious to the author that he destroyed every copy that he could obtain. The preface by his father says that<blockquote>at a very early period he read English so well that he was taught Latin at three years of age, and at four read Greek with an ease and fluency which astonished all who heard him. His talent for composition appeared at the age of seven.</blockquote>He briefly attended Bancroft's School and from 1810 to 1813 was a day scholar at Charterhouse, where he was friendly with George Waddington, George Grote, and J. C. Hare. After leaving school he seems to have worked alone for a year, entering Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in October 1814.<br>
<br>While an undergraduate Thirlwall found time to learn French and Italian, and, besides acquiring a considerable reputation as a speaker at the union, was secretary of the society when the debate was stopped by the entrance of the proctors (24 March 1817), who, by the vice-chancellor's command, ordered the members to disperse and on no account to resume their discussions. A few years later, when Thirlwall spoke at the Speculative Society, a debating society in London, John Stuart Mill recorded that he was the best speaker he had heard up to that time, and that he had not subsequently heard any one whom he could place above him  (Mill, 125). In 1815 he obtained the Bell and Craven scholarships, and in 1816 was elected scholar of his own college. There he was especially friendly with, and influenced by, William Whewell. In 1818 he graduated BA. He was twenty-second senior optime in the mathematical tripos, and also obtained the first chancellor's medal for proficiency in classics. In October of the same year he was elected fellow of his college.<br>
<br>Thirlwall was now able to realize what he called &#145;the most enchanting of my daydreams&#146;  (Stokes, 32), and spent several months on the continent. The winter of 1818&#150;19 was passed in Rome, where he formed a close friendship with Bunsen, then secretary to the Prussian legation, at the head of which was Niebuhr; a meeting between Thirlwall and the historian cannot be definitely established.<br>
<br>Thirlwall had at this time developed a dislike for the profession of a clergyman and, pressured by his family, he entered Lincoln's Inn in February 1820 in pupillage with Basevi, Disraeli's uncle. He was called to the bar in the summer of 1825 and practised for two years on the home circuit. Much of his success in later life may be traced to his legal training; but the work was always distasteful to him, though relieved by foreign tours, by intellectual society, and by a return to more congenial studies whenever he had a moment to spare. In 1824 he translated two tales by Tieck, and began his work on Schleiermacher's critical essay on St Luke's gospel. Both these were published (anonymously) in the following year, the second with a critical introduction, remarkable not only for thoroughness, but for acquaintance with modern German theology, then a field of research virtually untrodden by English students. In October 1827 Thirlwall abandoned law and returned to Cambridge. The prospect of the loss of his fellowship at Trinity College, which would have expired in 1828, probably determined the precise moment for taking a step which he had long meditated. He was ordained deacon before the end of 1827, and priest in 1828; his motivation seems to have been the opportunity for literary study.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Thirlwall at once undertook his full share of college and university work. Between 1827 and 1832 he held the college offices of junior bursar, junior dean, and head lecturer; in 1828, 1829, 1832, and 1834 he examined for the classical tripos. In 1828 the first volume of the translation of Niebuhr's history of Rome appeared, the joint work of himself and Julius Charles Hare. This was attacked in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (January 1829), and Thirlwall contributed to Hare's elaborate reply a brief postscript which is worthy of his best days as a controversialist. In 1831 the publication of <span class="italic">The Philological Museum</span> was started with the object of promoting &#145;the knowledge and the love of ancient literature&#146;. Hare and Thirlwall were the editors, and the latter contributed to it several masterly essays. It ceased in 1833. In 1829 Thirlwall held for a short time the vicarage of Over, and in 1832, when Hare left college, he was appointed assistant tutor. His lectures were as thorough and systematic as Hare's had been desultory.<br>
<br>In 1834 Thirlwall's connection with the educational staff of Trinity College was rudely severed when&#151;true to his liberalism&#151;he supported the admission of dissenters to Cambridge degrees. He replied to a pamphlet by T. Turton in a <span class="italic">Letter on the Admission of Dissenters to Academical Degrees</span>; it argued that &#145;Cambridge colleges are not theological seminaries&#146; or even &#145;schools of religious instruction&#146; and he attacked college divinity lectures and compulsory chapel. This publication is dated 21 May 1834, and five days later Christopher Wordsworth, master&#151;perhaps influenced by H. J. Rose&#151;wrote to the author, calling upon him to resign his appointment as assistant tutor. Thirlwall immediately obeyed and, as the master had added that he found &#145;some difficulty in understanding how a person with such sentiments can reconcile it to himself to continue a member of a society founded and conducted on principles from which he differs so widely&#146;, Thirlwall addressed a circular letter to the fellows, asking each of them to send him &#145;a private explicit and unreserved declaration&#146; on this point. Most desired to retain him, but several&#151;including Whewell with whom he quarrelled publicly on the matter&#151;did not acquit him of rashness; a few did not condemn the master's action.<br>
<br>On Thirlwall's return, in November 1834, from a continental visit Lord Brougham offered him the valuable living of Kirby Underdale in Yorkshire. He accepted without hesitation, and went into residence in July 1835. He had had little experience of parochial work, but he proved himself both energetic and successful in this new field; he was sometimes helped by W. H. Thompson.<br>
<br>He was elected to the senate of London University; when in London for meetings he met many Cambridge friends and in 1838 they formed the Sterling Club, for the exchange of (mainly liberal) ideas. At Kirby Underdale Thirlwall completed his <span class="italic">History of Greece</span> (8 vols., 1835&#150;44), originally published in the <span class="italic">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</span> of Dr Dionysius Lardner. This work entailed prodigious labour. At Cambridge, where the first volume was written, he used to work all day until half-past three, when he left his rooms for a rapid walk before dinner, at that time served in hall at four; in Yorkshire he is said to have worked sixteen hours a day in his study. By a curious coincidence he and George Grote, his friend and schoolfellow, were writing on the same subject at the same time, unknown to each other. On the appearance of Grote's first two volumes in 1846 Thirlwall welcomed them with generous praise, and when the publication of the fourth volume in 1847 enabled him to form a maturer judgement, he told the author that he rejoiced to think that his own performance would &#145;for all highest purposes, be so superseded&#146;  (Grote, 174). Grote in the preface to his work bore testimony to Thirlwall's learning, sagacity, and candour. Portions of Thirlwall's history were translated into German by Leonhard Schmitz in 1840, and into French by A. Joanne in 1852.<h2>
<a name="BishopofStDavids"></a>Bishop of St David's</h2>In 1840 Lord Melbourne offered the bishopric of St David's to Thirlwall. He had read his translation of Schleiermacher, and formed so high an opinion of the author that he wished to appoint him to Norwich in 1837, but was dissuaded by episcopal comment. In 1840 he took a stronger line, effectively pressing Thirlwall onto a reluctant Archbishop Howley, whose agreement to what was bound to be a controversial appointment he secured in advance. Tractarians, unsurprisingly, were scandalized, but the appointment was not challenged.<br>
<br>Thirlwall brought to the larger sphere of work as a bishop the thoroughness which had made him successful as a parish clergyman. Within a year he read prayers and preached in Welsh; he later encouraged the eisteddfod. He visited every part of his large and, at that time, little-known diocese; inspected the condition of schools and churches; and by personal liberality augmented the income of small livings. It has been estimated that he spent &pound;40,000 while bishop on charities of various kinds. After a quarter of a century of steady effort he could point to the restoration of 183 churches; to 30 parishes where new or restored churches were in progress; to many new parsonages; and to a large increase in education. Yet he was not personally popular. He was moody and unwilling to make the usual politenesses. He instituted priests without a word of encouragement. He was sarcastic with his colleagues and rude to his servants. Popular rumour had it that his dog was trained to know and bite curates. His friends were almost all in England and he relished his visits to London to stay with Monckton Milnes and visit the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45584', "Metaphysical Society")</script>. His almost reclusive existence at Abergwili was lightened from 1862 by an intense but apparently platonic friendship with a spirited and talented beauty, Elizabeth Johnes of Dolau Cothi, Pumpsaint, some 20 miles from Abergwili. Their correspondence was published after Thirlwall's death in <span class="italic">Letters to a Friend</span> (1881).<br>
<br>Thirlwall took a lively interest in the events of the day, and in all questions affecting not merely his own diocese but the church at large. On such he elaborated his decision unbiased by considerations of party, of his own order, or of public opinion. His seclusion from such influences gives a special value to his eleven triennial charges, which are, in fact, an epitome of the history of the Church of England during his episcopate, narrated by a man of judicial mind, without passion or prejudice, and fearless in the expression of his views. On controversial issues he often took the opposite side to the Anglican episcopate. He supported the grant to Maynooth (1845); the abolition of the civil disabilities of the Jews (1848); and, in a powerful and memorable speech, the disestablishment of the Irish church (1869). He was the only bishop to vote for the repeal of the corn laws in 1846. But he was a strong supporter of the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Act</span>. Though broad church in his interest in German theology and in his support for comprehension, his theological views did not advance. He quarrelled with Rowland Williams when the latter was vice-principal at Lampeter (Thirlwall's appointment), and Thirlwall's signature made unanimous the bishops' condemnation of <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860), a position Thirlwall defended in his <span class="italic">Charge</span> (1863). But he declined to prevent Bishop Colenso from preaching in his diocese, or to urge him to resign his bishopric.<br>
<br>Thirlwall was a regular attendant at convocation, a member of the royal commission on ritual (1868), and chairman of the Old Testament Revision Company. In May 1874 he resigned his bishopric and retired to Bath, blind and partially paralysed. He died unmarried at 59 Pulteney Street, Bath, on 27 July 1875. He was buried on 3 August in Westminster Abbey, in the same grave as George Grote. His funeral sermon, which was preached by Dean Stanley, formed the preface of the posthumous volume of Thirlwall's <span class="italic">Letters to a Friend</span> (1881). In 1884 the Thirlwall prize (for the best thesis involving historical research) was instituted at Cambridge in the bishop's memory. Thirlwall's life was one of paradox: a notable scholar whose early liberalism turned to theological caution; a priest who disliked the clergy; and a broad-church bishop preaching comprehension, whose sarcasm inspired few among his flock and revulsion among the many non-Anglicans in his diocese.<br>
