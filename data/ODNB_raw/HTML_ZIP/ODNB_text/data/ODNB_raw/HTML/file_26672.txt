<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Strode <span class="st"> [Stroud]</span>, Sir  George</span>  (1583&#150;1663), <span class="occ">royalist administrator</span>, was the second son of William Strode, landowner, of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, and Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Geoffrey Upton of Warminster in the same county. William Strode was grandnephew of Richard Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury. George Strode came to London and entered trade, and on 11 February 1615 married, at All Hallows Church, Lombard Street, Rebecca, daughter and coheir of Alderman Nicholas Crisp, first cousin to Sir Nicholas Crisp. They had fourteen children. Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1645) was sister-in-law to Sir Abraham Reynardson, lord mayor of London in 1648, and Sir Thomas Cullum, sheriff of London in 1646. <br>
<br>Strode shared the royalist opinions of his connections, and, like them, suffered in the cause. At the outbreak of hostilities Strode took service in the infantry and was knighted on 30 July 1641. For his role in organizing the infamous 1642 Kentish petition, parliament ordered his arrest. Bail was posted by Sir Nicholas Crisp and Strode's friend, the royalist William Russell. He then joined the king at Oxford and was appointed a commissioner of the ordnance about July. He conducted the artillery train at the battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642 and was badly wounded, a fact alluded to in his epitaph. Thereafter he remained at Oxford, his activities as ordnance commissioner vital to the royalist war effort. <br>
<br>By 1636 Strode owned the estate of Squeries in Kent, which he purchased from the Beresfords, and later he had to compound for it with the parliamentary commissioners. In 1646 Marylebone Park, a property of the crown, was granted by letters patent of Charles I, dated Oxford, 6 May, to Strode and fellow ordnance commissioner John Wandesford as security for a debt of &pound;2318 11<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., for supplying arms and ammunition. These claims were disregarded by the parliamentary party when in power, and the park was sold for the benefit of Colonel Thomas Harrison's dragoons. At the Restoration, Strode and Wandesford were reinstated, and held the park, with the exception of one portion, until their debt was discharged. <br>
<br>Late in the war, perhaps shortly after Rebecca died in October 1645, Strode went abroad, and there &#145;in these sad distracted times, when I was inforced to eat my bread in forein parts&#146;, as he wrote, he solaced himself by translating a work by Cristofero da Fonseca, which appeared in 1652, under the title <span class="italic">Theion en&#333;tikon: a Discourse of Holy Love, by which the Soul is United unto God</span>, &#145;done into English with much Variation and some Addition by Sr George Strode, Knight&#146;. Early in 1649 he returned to England and submitted to the committee for compounding, who fined him half his estate. Despite his composition, he remained on the fringes of royalist conspiracy in the early 1650s. He sold Squeries in 1650. <br>
<br>At the Restoration, he settled once more in London. His will, in which he declared his adherence to that &#145;orthodox religion, professed in this our Church of England&#146; which has &#145;flourished here for some years past, to the honour and glory of Almighty God and the Admonition of the neighbouring nations&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/311, sig. 76), was dated 24 August 1661, confirmed on 5 February following, and proved on 3 June 1663. Strode was buried in St James's Church, Clerkenwell, on the previous day; the entry in the registers of the church described him as &#145;that worthy Benefactour to Church and Poore&#146;  (Hovenden, 351). One of his sons, Sir Nicholas Strode, knighted on 27 June 1660, was an examiner in chancery; and another, Colonel John Strode, was in 1661 in personal attendance on Charles II, who appointed him governor of Dover Castle. One of the daughters, Anne, married successively Ellis, eldest son of Sir Nicholas Crisp, and Nicholas, eldest son of Abraham Reynardson.<br>
