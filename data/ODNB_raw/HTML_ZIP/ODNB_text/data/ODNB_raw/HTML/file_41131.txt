<span class="headword">Fawcett,  Charles Bungay</span>  (1883&#150;1952), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 25 August 1883 at Staindrop, co. Durham, the second son in the family of five children of John Fawcett (<i>b</i>. 1846), joiner, later sawmill superintendent, and his second wife, Eva, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bungay (<i>b</i>. 1856). He was educated at the school at Staindrop and then at Gainford grammar school in the nearby Tees valley, and became a pupil-schoolteacher. In 1904 he entered University College, Nottingham, and graduated BSc in 1908. He then taught at Long Eaton county school, and from 1910 to 1912 studied under A. J. Herbertson at Oxford for a diploma in geography. In 1913 he was awarded the degree of BLitt for a thesis entitled &#145;The fjord peoples: an essay in human geography&#146;. In the same year he was appointed as the first lecturer in geography at University College, Southampton.<br>
<br>Exempted from war service during the First World War through poor eyesight, Fawcett combined teaching with a post at the Ordnance Survey headquarters in Southampton. He received a London MSc degree in 1916, for a thesis entitled &#145;The middle Tees and its tributaries&#146;. On 5 April 1917, at Southampton register office, he married Nora Loxston (1892&#150;1982), a schoolteacher, the daughter of Charles Loxston, locomotive driver. They had two daughters. Fawcett's first book, <span class="italic">Frontiers: a Study in Political Geography</span> (1918), was followed by a more significant volume, <span class="italic">Provinces of England: a Study of Some Geographical Aspects of Devolution</span> (1919), in the <span class="roman">Making of the Future</span> series edited by Victor Branford and Patrick Geddes. Fawcett defined functional regions around major cities and made a powerful case for reforming England's archaic administrative units. He was attracted by notions of centrality, regionalism, devolution, and federalism; this book was republished in 1960.<br>
<br>In 1919 Fawcett moved to the University of Leeds, where geography was being developed as an independent subject. He was promoted to a readership in 1920, and lectured to honours students, schoolteachers taking the teaching diploma, and clerical workers of the North-Eastern Railway who studied &#145;railway geography&#146;. He displayed detailed knowledge of northern England in three chapters of <span class="italic">Great Britain: Essays in Regional Geography</span> (1928), edited by A. G. Ogilvie. At that time Lionel Lyde retired from the chair of geography at University College, London, and Fawcett replaced him in September 1928. He had gained administrative experience at Leeds, had published two books and sixteen articles or chapters, and had acquired a London DSc degree in 1925 for his corpus of publications. At University College Fawcett built up a core team, including R. Ogilvie Buchanan, Robert E. Dickinson (his prot&eacute;g&eacute; from Leeds), and Arthur E. Smailes. Fawcett gained a reputation as a kind, approachable, and sympathetic teacher, who delivered well-organized lectures, demonstrated a formidable grasp of factual information, and avoided hasty, overgeneralized conclusions. As a visiting professor he took those qualities to Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1930&#150;31.<br>
<br>Fawcett published articles and books on regional planning in Britain, political geography, population, food supplies, and agricultural land, as well as pioneering work on &#145;conurbations&#146;. In <span class="italic">A Political Geography of the British Empire</span> (1933) he stressed geographical facts that influenced the development and organization of imperial lands, arguing that loyalty to the British flag could accommodate peoples of many different cultures, languages, and religions. <span class="italic">The Bases of a World Commonwealth</span> (1941) articulated his humanistic beliefs and stressed the existence of a community of interest to either side of the north Atlantic, but underplayed the global impact of communism and the rising might of the USSR. This book was followed by <span class="italic">A Residential Unit for Town and Country Planning</span> (1944).<br>
<br>Fawcett was firmly committed to the promotion of geography, serving for many years on the council and executive committee of the Geographical Association and on the council of the Royal Geographical Society (1929&#150;33 and 1945&#150;9). He was a prime mover in the creation of the Institute of British Geographers, and became its first president (1933&#150;6). He was active in establishing the Association of University Teachers and was chairman of the council of the Le Play Society in the 1930s. In 1937 he was president of section E (geography) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He presented papers at the International Geographical Congress (in 1928, 1931, and 1934), and headed the British delegation at the congress in 1949, when he was elected to the chair of the commission on population.<br>
<br>When the departments of University College, London, were evacuated to colleges of the University of Wales during the Second World War Fawcett became deputy provost of University College, London, at Aberystwyth. When his department returned to war-torn central London in 1944 he took on more external commitments as national president of the Association of University Teachers (1945&#150;6), council member (1945&#150;9) and vice-president (1949&#150;51) of the Royal Geographical Society, and again visiting professor at Clark University (1946&#150;7). After the departure from University College of Dickinson in 1947 and Buchanan in 1949, he retired in 1949 and was succeeded by Henry Clifford Darby. He yet again went back to teach at Clark University (1949&#150;51), where he was made an honorary ScD (1951), and was then visiting professor at the University of Ceylon (1951&#150;2). He was taken ill in Calcutta in 1952 and returned with his wife to England. His health deteriorated and he died at the Royal County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey, on 21 September 1952. His funeral was held at Golders Green crematorium on 25 September. He was survived by his wife and daughters, Edith and Ruth.<br>
