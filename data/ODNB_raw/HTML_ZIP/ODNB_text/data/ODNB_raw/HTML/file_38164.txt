<span class="headword">Young,  John</span>  (1585&#150;1654), <span class="occ">dean of Winchester</span>, was born in Seaton, Forfarshire, on 25 June 1585, the sixth of eight sons and the eighth of twelve children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30277/', "Sir Peter Young (1544&#150;1628)")</script>, tutor to James VI of Scotland, and his first wife, Elizabeth Gibb (<i>d</i>. 1593). He attended St Andrews University and took his MA by 1606, when he was incorporated at Cambridge and elected a fellow of Sidney Sussex College. He is alleged to have been one of the first Scots to take a degree at Cambridge. He was ordained priest in December 1610 by Bishop George Abbot of London, had received his BD by 1611 and his DD by 1613, and for a time was tutor to Lord Wharton's son.<br>
<br>As son of the king's tutor and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30276/', "Patrick Young")</script>, the royal librarian, Young enjoyed excellent court connections, which explains his steady preferment after 1611. He was created chancellor of Wells Cathedral in 1611 by Bishop James Montagu, and probably received a canonry at York in 1613; he became a royal chaplain, and in 1616 dean of Winchester. He and his heirs were granted free denization in 1616, and he became rector of Over Wallop in Hampshire in 1620. About 1615 Young married Sarah (<i>d</i>. before 1652), daughter of Andrew Bourman of Wells. They had three sons and two daughters, all of whom were to predecease him except his youngest son, John.<br>
<br>As dean of Winchester, Young was an active servant of James I. Between 1616 and 1621 he made repeated visits to Scotland on royal business, accompanying the king in 1617, and attending the general assembly in Perth in 1618 in support of the king's five articles of ceremonial reform. Young's Scottish background, Calvinist convictions, and diplomatic skills made him an ideal emissary, and he was praised by the archbishop of St Andrews, among others, for his persuasive performance.<br>
<br>During the Synod of Dort (1618&#150;19) he was an important intermediary between Samuel Ward (<i>d</i>. 1643), one of the British delegates, and the king, whom he persuaded to moderate the British position on the universality of divine grace. In 1622 he was ordered to interview the archbishop of Spalato, a convert on the point of returning to Rome, and letters between the two survive. Young could reasonably have expected a bishopric, but he was repeatedly passed over and in 1626 apparently offered &pound;15,000 for the vacant see of Winchester. In 1633 Young was tipped to become bishop of the new see of Edinburgh but the post eventually went to William Forbes; although he remained a royal chaplain until at least 1644, Young evidently did not enjoy the same regard from Charles I or Archbishop William Laud as he had from James I. His activities as dean of Winchester are recorded in his diary, preserved in Winchester Cathedral. He regularly urged the chapter to attend prayers, observe the preaching rota, and practise collegiality. In the 1630s, in particular, he presided over a fractious chapter, divided by personal and some ideological conflict.<br>
<br>Young took little part in the civil war, but was ejected from his deanery in 1645 and retired to Over Wallop, where he lived until he died on 20 July 1654. He was buried in Exton, Hampshire. His will, dated 2 August 1652, was proved on 18 September 1654.<br>
