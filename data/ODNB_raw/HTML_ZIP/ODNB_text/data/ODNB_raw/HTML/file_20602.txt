<span class="headword">Ogilvy, Sir  Walter, of Lintrathen</span>  (<em>c.</em>1380&#150;1438), <span class="occ">administrator and landowner</span>, was the second son of Sir Walter Ogilvy of Auchterhouse (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1368&#150;1392). His mother is said to have been Isabella, daughter and heir of Sir Malcolm Ramsay of Auchterhouse. From about 1400 the younger Walter built up his landed patrimony, <i>c</i>.1414 obtaining from Archibald Douglas, fourth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1424), a grant of the barony of Lintrathen, Angus, whence his style. His lands lay in Angus, Kincardineshire, Berwickshire, and Perthshire. He is also occasionally styled of Carcary or of Bolshan, both in Angus. In 1431 he received a licence from James I to erect his tower of Airlie, Angus, in the form of a castle.<br>
<br>Ogilvy was knighted at the coronation of James I on 21 May 1424, after the latter's return from captivity in England. By November 1424 he was styled king's treasurer, a post introduced by James I. The treasurer and the comptroller, another new office, exercised the financial powers formerly held by the chamberlain, but the division of responsibilities before the 1460s is unclear. In the 1420s, at least, it seems that both the new officials dealt with the finances of the royal household, although eventually the treasurer was concerned in the main with feudal casualties. Until late 1432 Ogilvy was almost always present as a witness when crown charters were granted. From July 1430 he is normally styled master of the king's household, a post he had yielded by August 1432. While Ogilvy seldom thereafter witnessed crown charters, he had not fallen from favour, as in November 1432 he and others had an (apparently unused) English safe conduct for a year to go as Scots ambassadors to the Council of Basel. In March 1436 he accompanied James I's daughter Margaret on her journey to France to marry the dauphin, the future Louis XI. (Also in March 1436 another unimpeachable source has a Sir Walter Ogilvy present at Florence promising Pope Eugenius IV and his cardinals to attempt to persuade James I to repeal legislation against ecclesiastical liberty. Ogilvy of Lintrathen cannot have carried out both missions, but the identity of the other Sir Walter Ogilvy is uncertain.)<br>
<br>After the murder of James I in 1437 Ogilvy was briefly treasurer again and may have resumed a career at court, but he died in late 1438; he is said to have been buried in Kinnell kirk. In 1427 and 1432 he founded chaplainries in Auchterhouse parish church. He and his first wife, Isabel (<i>d</i>. in or before 1405), whose surname was possibly Durward, had two sons. Sir John, the elder, married Margaret, countess of Moray, widow probably of Thomas Dunbar, third earl of Moray, and their eldest son, James, was created Lord Ogilvy of Airlie in 1491. Sir Walter married second Isabel (<i>fl</i>. 1405&#150;1440), daughter of Sir John Glen of Inchmartin and Margaret Erskine. They had five sons and two daughters, one of whom, Isabel, married first Patrick Lyon, first Lord Glamis, and second Gilbert, first Lord Kennedy. Sir Walter's widow survived him and married Robert Cunningham of Auchenbowie (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1466).<br>
