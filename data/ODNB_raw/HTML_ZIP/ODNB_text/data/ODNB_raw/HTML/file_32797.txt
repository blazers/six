<span class="headword">Vere,  Aubrey Thomas  de</span>  (1814&#150;1902), <span class="occ">poet</span>, born on the family estate of Curragh Chase, Adare, co. Limerick, on 10 January 1814, was the third son of Aubrey Vere Hunt, later styled <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7562/', "Sir Aubrey De Vere, second baronet (1788&#150;1846)")</script>, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1856), who was the eldest daughter of Stephen Edward Rice (<i>d</i>. 1831) of Mount Trenchard, co. Limerick, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26179/', "Thomas Spring Rice, first Lord Monteagle (1790&#150;1866)")</script>. Aubrey's two elder brothers successively inherited the baronetcy. His father supported Catholic emancipation, so that, when the bill granting it was passed, young Aubrey climbed a pillar outside the house and waved a torch in the darkness. He was educated privately and one of his tutors, Edward Johnstone, aroused the boy's interest in Wordsworth, an enthusiasm that lasted for life. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1832 where he studied in a desultory manner, concentrating on metaphysics and theology rather than on the more mundane aspects of a course which seemed to destine him for holy orders in the Church of Ireland, a path in line with his father's wishes for his third son. In 1837 he won a prize for an essay on theology, and the following year he left the college without committing himself to the church. He visited Oxford in 1838 and met John Henry (later Cardinal) Newman, who was a leading Tractarian, arguing for the reform of Anglicanism along traditional lines. De Vere admired Newman's sincerity and holiness, describing him as being like a &#145;youthful ascetic of the middle ages&#146;  (de Vere, 256). In 1839 de Vere visited Cambridge, where he discovered an entirely different intellectual climate in the Apostles club, where everything was openly discussed with complete freedom, and where traditional practices and the idea of authority were relentlessly questioned. His cousin Stephen Spring Rice was a member of this club and in their correspondence de Vere steadily withdraws from the Apostles' view that liberty is the freedom to do and think as one likes to a more orthodox position, conducive to settled concepts of authority and revealed truth. In one of his letters, he writes: &#145;Religio [means] <i>to bind again</i> &hellip; and how can you bind except by Doctrines reduced to their orthodox form and Duties explained, applied, and enforced?&#146;  (Ward, 59). Through his cousin's association with the Apostles, de Vere met Richard Monckton Milnes, poet and biographer of Keats, and James Spedding, the great editor of Francis Bacon. Although Tennyson was another Apostle, de Vere did not meet him until 1842. The year before, 1841, he had met Wordsworth, by then poet laureate, while in London attending to the publication of two books of poems by his father: <span class="italic">Sonnets</span> and <span class="italic">Song of Faith</span>. He was invited to the Lake District, where he fitted easily into Wordsworth's extended household, including Sara Coleridge, daughter of the poet, and Isabella Fenwick.<br>
<br>In 1842 de Vere published <span class="italic">The Waldenses and Other Poems</span>, containing lyrics and meditations on religion, which he dedicated to the mathematician and astronomer William Rowan Hamilton, whom he had known at Trinity College, and with whom he had discussed belief and the evidence of nature. In 1843 appeared <span class="italic">The Search after Proserpine and Other Poems</span>, a copy of which he sent to Walter Savage Landor, whom he had long admired. Landor did not read the book for five years but when he did heaped praise upon it, and hailed de Vere as breathing the &#145;pure fresh air&#146; of Greece  (Taylor, 255). However, when he travelled in the Mediterranean in 1843 he found the Greeks &#145;a false people &hellip; never ashamed of being detected in a lie&#146;, as he wrote later in his <span class="italic">Picturesque Sketches of Greece and Turkey</span>  (1850, 1.11). In 1845 he spent a good deal of time in London, where he met Thomas Carlyle and his wife, Jane Welsh, whom he greatly impressed with his youthful good looks, religious air, and contempt for society wit. His father, Sir Aubrey, was ailing at this time, and went to London for treatment, where he was looked after by his son, who approved of the paintings by Rembrandt and Correggio bought for Curragh Chase. In late autumn and early winter 1845 he went on a walking tour of Scotland; when he reached Edinburgh news began to arrive of the consequences of the failure of the potato crop that year in Ireland, the first onset of what was to become known as the great famine. His father died in July 1846, as the blight began to strike a second time. With his brothers Vere, Stephen, William, and Horace he threw himself into the organization of famine relief schemes, helped in the distribution of the Indian corn (maize) that was sent in to the areas where starvation was rife, tried to work on the consciences of his fellow landlords encouraging them to commit resources to match those allocated from government, and attempted to supervise and regulate the process of emigration. De Vere also set up a scheme whereby women were engaged in a number of industries, and then faced the problem of disposing of manufactured goods for which there was no market. This extensive range of voluntary activities informed his study of Anglo-Irish political economy <span class="italic">English Misrule and Irish Misdeeds</span> (1848). He recognized a depth of anti-Irish feeling in England, and called for systematic emigration from a rural society that was uneconomic, as well as the redevelopment of agriculture along efficient lines. His direct experience of the famine in Limerick and in Clare informed his threnody on the disaster &#145;The Year of Sorrow&#151;Ireland 1849&#146;, which he included in <span class="italic">Inisfail</span> (1861), a lyrical chronicle of Ireland, which sees it as an isle of destiny, whose people are fated to suffer affliction so they may accomplish a spiritual mission in the world. De Vere employs different forms and voices, from rhapsodic declamation to terse quatrains, to depict Ireland's varied history and traditions, but the thinking is fatalistic. Of Ireland he says, in the &#145;Introduction&#146;: &#145;Her Fatalism meant simply a profound sense of Religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Inisfail</span>, xx).<br>
<br>By 1851 de Vere had taken the step to which he had been tending since meeting Newman in 1838. In 1850 he spent time in the company of Henry Edward (later Cardinal) Manning, and together they studied Aquinas and Dante. Manning left the Anglican church in April 1851; in the autumn he and de Vere set off for Rome, on a pilgrimage, and de Vere was accepted into the Catholic church at Avignon on 15 November, much to the dismay of Carlyle, who warned him against submitting himself to the bondage of traditional orthodoxy.<br>
<br>In 1854 the Irish Catholic hierarchy, in an attempt to establish a system of higher education for their congregation, appointed Newman to be first rector of the Catholic University of Ireland. Newman made a number of professorial appointments and established de Vere in the chair of political and social science, recognizing his candidate's experience of affairs, and his analysis of administrative and economic difficulties in Ireland. However, de Vere had no students and gave no lectures. He was working on a poetic task Pope Pius IX had suggested during an audience in Rome after his conversion in 1851: that he devote his imaginative energies to poems on the Virgin Mary and the saints of the church. The first instalment of this project appeared in 1857 as <span class="italic">May Carols, or, Ancilla domini</span>, which celebrate Mary as the mediatrix between the material and spiritual worlds, the means whereby the incarnation took place in human flesh. He sees her animating all beauty, and, in particular, flowing through the annual resurrection of spring. <span class="italic">Legends of St Patrick</span> (1872) versified episodes from the saint's life and his conversion of the Irish to Christianity, while <span class="italic">Legends of the Saxon Saints</span> (1879) undertook a similar task for St Cuthbert, Caedmon, and others. His approach to Catholic doctrine, and the way in which it might be expressed in poetry, had something in common with that of Gerard Manley Hopkins, the English Jesuit whom Newman brought to teach in the Catholic University. They were in most other respects very different. Mutual friends once arranged for them to meet at Howth, but de Vere was gone when Hopkins arrived. When he learned from his hosts that de Vere had a poor opinion of Dryden, Hopkins thought that he had &#145;not missed much&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Alexander the Great</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">St Thomas of Canterbury</span> (1876) were two leaden ventures into that sepulchre of imaginative energy: the Victorian verse-drama. Like many Victorians, de Vere saw the early phases of culture as periods in which essential features of a people or a civilization were realized, hence his interest in early heroes and saints, and his desire to reanimate legendary styles of thought and feeling. <span class="italic">The Foray of Queen Maeve</span> (1882) was another such attempt at reading the early traces of culture and identity in Ireland; he based it on a manuscript translation of the Irish saga <span class="italic">T&aacute;in B&oacute; Cuailnge</span> by Brian O'Looney in the Royal Irish Academy. <span class="italic">Constitutional and Unconstitutional Political Action</span> (1882), a pamphlet written in reaction to the murder in Phoenix Park of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the newly appointed chief secretary of Ireland, by the Invincibles, a Fenian splinter group, shows his commitment to non-violent reform. <span class="italic">Essays Literary and Ethical</span> (1889) mixes literary criticism with meditations on issues such as church property and materialism. His <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (1897) recalls a long life, many friendships, and his path towards a fixed set of religious convictions.<br>
<br>De Vere did not marry, but he seems to have been one of those for whom celibacy poses no difficulty. He died at Curragh Chase on 21 January 1902 and was buried in the churchyard at Askeaton, co. Limerick.<br>
