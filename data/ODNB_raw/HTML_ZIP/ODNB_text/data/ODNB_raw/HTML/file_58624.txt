<span class="headword">MacManus <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Johnston]</span>,  Anna Isabel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ethna Carbery]</span>  (1866&#150;1902), <span class="occ">poet and journalist</span>, was born in Ballymena, co. Antrim, on 3 December 1866, the elder daughter of the two daughters and one son of Robert Johnston (1836&#150;1937), a wealthy timber merchant and prominent member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The family later lived in Donegall Park, Belfast. Anna Johnston had begun to publish poetry under her own name by 1886, contributing to nationalist journals and newspapers including the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span> and <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>. She also established contacts with literary and nationalist circles in Dublin, in particular the circle around Katharine Tynan. In October 1895 she co-founded a radical journal, the <span class="italic">Northern Patriot</span>, with her friend the poet and nationalist Alice Milligan (1866&#150;1953); however they lost editorial control in December 1895 after a disagreement with the Belfast Workingmen's Club, the journal's sponsor. The friends then founded a rival journal, the republican <span class="italic">Shan Van Vocht</span>, which ran from January 1896 to April 1899. The editors supplied much as Iris Olkyrn and Ethna Carbery (Anna Johnston contributed over forty signed poems and stories) and they were also responsible for production and distribution. The <span class="italic">Shan Van Vocht</span> provided a digest of Irish radical and cultural nationalist activities in the period; it published early writings by James Connolly. The literary content was also impressive, including poetry by Lionel Johnson, Douglas Hyde, and Nora Hopper.<br>
<br>Anna Johnston was a sincere nationalist, but, unlike Alice Milligan, was opposed to amnesty for dynamitards. She had links with the Irish National Alliance, a revolutionary movement, and was a member of the Ulster '98 Centenary Committee: in 1899 Dublin Castle linked her to anti-recruiting groups in Ireland. Anna Johnston's most conspicuous contribution to Irish cultural nationalism was in 1899, when she played Princess Eithne in the first Irish-language play performed in Ireland. At the time of her death she was vice-president of Inghinidhe n hEireann, the Irish women's organization.<br>
<br>An early and regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Shan Van Vocht</span> was Seamus MacManus (1869&#150;1960), a Donegal schoolmaster from a farming background, who, as Mac of Glen Ainey, had begun to publish verse and folk sketches in the <span class="italic">Donegal Vindicator</span>. MacManus rapidly became a friend of both women and his aggressive nationalism gave him easy entry to Anna Johnston's home. In early September 1899 she went on a political-cultural propaganda tour of Donegal with Alice Milligan and other nationalists, including MacManus, with whom she had fallen in love. She was profoundly shocked to discover that he was about to emigrate to the United States. MacManus left Ireland in late September 1898, and subsequently claimed that he had been financed by the French government to raise Irish-American support for a war against Great Britain. MacManus made good use of his time in the United States, placing his folk tales and Donegal anecdotes in magazines and securing book contracts. He returned to Ireland in spring 1899 and by then was probably aware of Anna Johnston's feelings, already expressed in &#145;Paistin Fionn&#146;, published by &#145;E. D. M.&#146; in the <span class="italic">Shan Van Vocht</span> on 7 November 1898. They married in spring 1901 and lived at Mount Revelinn House, Revlin, co. Donegal, where Anna MacManus died of gastritis on 2 April 1902; she was buried two days later in the Catholic churchyard at Frosses, co. Donegal. Her death was deemed to be &#145;almost a national calamity&#146;  (Ryan, 181) and nationalist papers printed lengthy eulogies of Ethna Carbery.<br>
<br>Anna MacManus's writing focused on the Irish past, on folklore and mythology, although she also published political verse, such as &#145;The Suppliant&#146;, an attack on Queen Victoria's visit to Ireland, published in the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span> in April 1900. Her verse is most successful when she works within a folk tradition; her love poems addressed to Seamus MacManus, such as &#145;Mo Bhuachaill Cael-Dubh&#146; and &#145;Paistin Fionn&#146; follow folk-song models, but infuse them with fresh emotion. Her mythological-historical poems influenced by Sir Samuel Ferguson, such as &#145;Niall Glondubh to Gormlai&#146;, and her historical-patriotic poems influenced by Thomas Davis, such as &#145;The Erin's Hope&#146;, are less compelling. Seamus Macmanus collected her poems as <span class="italic">The Four Winds of Eirinn</span> in 1902. The volume was remarkably successful, going through ten editions in 1902 and fifteen editions by 1905&#151;Anna MacManus's melancholy looks and her early death enhanced her stature. MacManus skilfully managed her reputation, enlarging the volume, adding a highly charged memoir to the 1918 edition and family photographs to the 1934 edition. MacManus collected his wife's historical and legendary fictions as <span class="italic">In the Celtic Past</span> (1904) and her love stories, influenced by &#145;Fiona MacLeod&#146;, as <span class="italic">The Passionate Hearts</span> (1903).<br>
<br>MacManus's assertion that &#145;Ethna Carbery&#146; was &#145;<i>the</i> Irish poet of &hellip; the Revival period &hellip; she reached the Irish heart as it has not been reached by any Irish poet in a century&#146;  (<span class="italic">Four Winds</span>, 158&#150;9) is not just a widower's piety. Mary Colum summed up Anna MacManus's popularity:<blockquote>Every one of the numerous mothers who had a son or daughter in America was pierced to the heart by her [&#145;Paistin Fionn&#146;] &hellip; she was probably the most widely read poet in Ireland, and I should not be surprised if her death was not more mourned throughout the country than the death of Yeats. (Colum, 115&#150;16)</blockquote>
