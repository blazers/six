<span class="headword">Chaudhurani, Sarala Devi</span>  (1872&#150;1945), <span class="occ">political activist and campaigner for women's rights in India</span>, was born on 9 September 1872 at Jorasanko, Calcutta, the younger daughter and youngest of the three children of Janakinath Ghosal (1840&#150;1913), son of a local <i>zamindar</i> of Krishnanagar, and a supporter of the Indian National Congress, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107184/', "Swarnakumari Devi (1855&#150;1932)")</script>, daughter of Debendranath Tagore, sister of Rabindranath Tagore, and herself a noted author. Sarala's older sister, Hironmoyee, was an author and founder of a widows' home. Her brother, Jyotsna, joined the Indian Civil Service. The family was Brahmo (i.e. following the religion founded by Rammohun Roy and developed by Sarala's grandfather Debendranath Tagore).<br>
<br>Owing to her father's absence abroad Sarala spent a few of her formative years in the progressive and unique cultural ambience of Jorasanko house (the ancestral home of the Tagore family). She received a BA degree with honours in English from Bethune College in 1890, securing the Padmavati medal for the best woman student. Her brief employment at Maharani School, Mysore, gave her an exposure to the wider world of India that she much valued. She entered politics through the power of her music. In 1901, at the Congress session in Calcutta, she mesmerized the audience, leading a chorus of fifty women from different parts of India with a stirring nationalist song she had composed and arranged. Later she composed and published a number of nationalist songs. Collecting folk-songs was her passion; she took some to her uncle Rabindranath Tagore for him to use, alter, or absorb. She claimed that &#145;O Amar Sonar Bangla&#146; (later the national anthem of Bangladesh) was one such creation  (<span class="italic">Jibaner Jharapata</span>, 33). She also spoke and wrote extensively and edited the prestigious journal <span class="italic">Bharati</span> jointly with her mother and sister for a few years, and on her own from 1899 to 1907. Her intention was both to propagate nationalism and a national spirit, and to elevate the literary standard of the journal.<br>
<br>Sarala's signal contribution to nationalism was to encourage a martial, heroic culture among the youth of Bengal. She formed an <i>akhra</i> (club) and a <i>byayam samiti</i> (gymnasium) in her home, which subsequently inspired others to follow suit. Placing a map of India before the members, she tied a <i>rakhi</i> (red thread, a symbol of brotherhood) to their wrists and made them promise to serve India with their entire body and mind. She appointed Murtaza, a Muslim, to teach the boys boxing, sword-fighting, and games with knives and rods. In 1902 she inaugurated the <i>birashtami utsav</i> (festival of heroes) when she invited members of other clubs to pay homage along with the boys of her <i>akhra</i> to the past heroes of India, and participate in competitive games. Later she introduced a <i>pratapaditya utsav</i> and an <i>udayaditya utsav</i> in memory of Bengali heroes who had bravely fought against the Mughals and Portuguese pirates. These attempts to develop youth power were part of her plan to help free the country through armed revolt.<br>
<br>Sarala also helped to advance the interests of women. In 1904 she started the Lakshmir Bhandar (women's store) in Calcutta with a view to popularizing indigenous goods, especially those made by women. In 1910 she founded the Bharat Stree Mahamandal, the first all-India women's organization. With several branches in the country, it promoted education and vocational training for women irrespective of class, caste, or creed.<br>
<br>In 1905, under tremendous family pressure, Sarala married Rambhuj Dutt Chaudhury (<i>d</i>. 1923), a lawyer, journalist, and nationalist leader who belonged to the Arya Samaj (the Hindu reform movement founded by Swami Dayananda Saraswati in 1875). She had gone to visit Mayavati Ashram in the Himalayas when she was summoned back by her mother (who, she was told, was seriously ill). She arrived to find that preparations for a wedding had been made. Her mother clearly felt that it was high time for Sarala, as a Bengali woman, to be married (rather than lead a band of young men); the family honour was at stake. Significantly her autobiography, <span class="italic">Jibaner Jharapata</span>, ended with her marriage. In it she wrote that her &#145;hands and feet were tied&#146; and that &#145;there was no space for movement&#146;  (p. 186).<br>
<br>After her marriage Sarala moved to the Punjab, where she helped her husband edit the nationalist Urdu weekly <span class="italic">Hindusthan</span>. When the colonial government threatened to cancel the licence of the paper if Rambhuj remained the proprietor, she registered her name as proprietor and editor, and brought out an English version of the paper. When Rambhuj was arrested for his part in the non-co-operation movement following the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre (1919), Gandhi came to Lahore as Sarala's house guest. A profound friendship developed between the two, and Sarala became a follower of Gandhi. She returned to Bengal after Rambhuj's death in 1923. Her only son, Dipak, married Gandhi's granddaughter Radha. On her return to Calcutta, Sarala devoted herself to the editorship of <span class="italic">Bharati</span> from 1924 to 1926, and established a girls' school, Siksha Sadan, there in 1930. She retired from public life in 1935, and turned to religion, choosing the Vaishnavite Bijoykrishna Goswami as her guru. She died on 18 August 1945 in Calcutta.<br>
<br>One of the first female political leaders in the Indian freedom movement, Sarala sympathized with revolutionary philosophy. She actively assisted secret revolutionary societies, made fiery speeches, and wrote fiercely nationalistic articles. In addition to working for the cause of women, she presided over assemblies of men, sang in public forums, and was much admired by her contemporaries. The revolutionary turned a Gandhian in later life; the reason for her voluntary retirement is unknown.<br>
