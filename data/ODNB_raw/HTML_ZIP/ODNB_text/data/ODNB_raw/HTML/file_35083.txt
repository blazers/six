<span class="headword">Monypenny,  William Flavelle</span>  (1866&#150;1912), <span class="occ">journalist and biographer</span>, came of an Ulster protestant family of Scottish extraction, which until 1898 spelt the surname Monypeny. The second son of William Monypeny, a small landowner, of Ballyworkan, co. Armagh, and of Mary Anne Flavelle, his wife, he was born probably at Dungannon, co. Tyrone, or possibly in co. Armagh, on 7 August 1866. Educated at the Royal School, Dungannon, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with high distinction in mathematics, he proceeded to Balliol College, Oxford; but temporary ill health compelled him, after a short residence (1889&#150;90), to leave Oxford for London, and he became a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. In 1893 he joined the editorial staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, where his outstanding abilities were quickly recognized.<br>
<br>Early in 1899 Monypenny was offered unexpectedly the editorship of the Johannesburg <span class="italic">Star</span>, the foremost organ of the Uitlanders, who were suffering under the oppressive rule of President Kruger. The offer was accompanied by an assurance of unhampered editorial freedom. It was specially attractive to a man &#145;inspired by a lofty imperial patriotism and a keen interest in practical politics&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9f). He accepted it, and made the journal a power in the political struggle that ensued. This was not achieved without personal risk. Threats were made against his life, and on one occasion he was assaulted in his office. When, later, he learned that a warrant for high treason had been taken out against him, he reluctantly withdrew to the sanctuary of British territory. On the outbreak of the South African War he obtained a commission in the Imperial light horse, fought in Natal, and, to the detriment of his health, endured the siege of Ladysmith. Later, under Lord Milner's high commissionership, he became director of civil supplies and a member of the committee for regulating the return of refugees after the annexation of the Transvaal. When the <span class="italic">Star</span> was again published he resumed the editorship, and marshalled the paper behind Milner's imperial vision for South Africa in the aftermath of the war. However, he resigned from the <span class="italic">Star</span> in 1903 from a scrupulous sense of honour, finding himself unable to countenance the importation of indentured Chinese labour. He made his way from Lake Victoria by an exhausting tramp past Wadelai and Dufile and down the White Nile to Khartoum, and thence to England, where he rejoined the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He contributed the opening chapter, &#145;The imperial ideal&#146;, to the collection of essays published in 1905 as <span class="italic">The Empire and the Century</span>. It is a statement of Monypenny's belief that by maintaining its empire, Britain could play a moderating role in world affairs, which would ensure its continued pre-eminence. In 1908 he was appointed an original director of the Times Publishing Company.<br>
<br>Monypenny's great opportunity came when he was chosen by <span class="italic">The Times</span> to write the authoritative biography of Disraeli, from the &#145;vast mass of papers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>) that had been bequeathed to Lord Rowton. The choice was greeted with surprise by some, who thought that Monypenny lacked the necessary experience of people and affairs. He had, though, taken a lifelong interest in the greater issues of politics, imperial and domestic, and he brought to bear a judgement of conspicuous sagacity, fortified by close observation, penetrating shrewdness, and a natural gift for separating the essential from the accidental. These qualities gave weight to a lucid style, charged with thought.<br>
<br>The first volume of Monypenny's <span class="italic">Life of Benjamin Disraeli</span> appeared, to critical acclaim, in October 1910, and the second, delayed by failing health, in November 1912. Ten days later, on 23 November, Monypenny died suddenly of heart failure in a nursing home in the New Forest, Lingford, Ringwood, Hampshire. The biography was continued, and completed in four more volumes, by George Earle Buckle, the editor under whom Monypenny had served on <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Buckle also wrote the inscription for the memorial tablet in the parish church of Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, where Monypenny was buried on 27 November 1912. Monypenny never married.<br>
