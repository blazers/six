<span class="headword">Rossa,  Mary Jane  O'Donovan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mary Jane Irwin]</span>  (1845&#150;1916), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and poet</span>, was born in January 1845 in Clonakilty, co. Cork, the daughter of a successful businessman named Irwin. She was educated for three years at the Sacred Heart Convent in Roscrea, co. Tipperary. In the spring of 1864 she met the nationalist and Fenian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46330/', "Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa (bap. 1831, d. 1915)")</script>, and the couple were secretly married on 22 November 1864, Mary Jane becoming O'Donovan Rossa's third wife, despite the opposition of her family. O'Donovan Rossa managed the Fenian paper the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>, and Mary Jane's first poem, &#145;The Ruin&#146;, was published there in May 1864. She was regarded, at this stage, as an inexperienced but talented young poet. Some of her poetry, however, was classified by the police as seditious. When the <span class="italic">Irish People</span> office was raided in September 1865, and most of the staff imprisoned, Mary Jane became one of the founders of, and secretary to, the Ladies' Committee, which aimed to raise funds for the families of imprisoned Fenians: her own husband had been sentenced to twenty years' penal servitude in 1865 for his Fenian activities.<br>
<br>The years 1865&#150;70 proved to be the most politically active years of Mary Jane O'Donovan Rossa's life. She acted as secretary to the Ladies' Committee for eighteen months, during which she and her children were supported from committee funds. She resigned from the committee in April 1867, stating she did not wish to be financially dependent on it. It would appear that she was also disappointed in her work for the committee, having openly criticized many of the Fenians and having in turn been publicly attacked for her views. She was also disillusioned by the abortive Fenian rising of February 1867, and in that year she went to America, leaving her son, Maxwell, and two of O'Donovan Rossa's five children from his previous marriages in the care of her parents. She wrote poetry for the New York <span class="italic">Irishman</span> in order to make a living. With the assistance of Fenian friends she published a volume, <span class="italic">Irish Lyrical Poems</span>, in 1868. Later she took up a very successful career as a public reader, and toured the United States and Canada in 1868&#150;9. The purpose of this tour was to promote the cause of Ireland, to raise funds for the Fenians, and to try to reopen the trial of her husband.<br>
<br>Mary Jane O'Donovan Rossa was openly critical of the Fenian leadership. She took out a lawsuit against the Fenian chief John O'Mahony to claim $8000 which her husband had loaned the movement for the organization of the <span class="italic">Irish People</span> in the 1860s. She was attacked for this action, but withdrew her claim only on the advice of her husband. In January 1870 she returned to Ireland to campaign for her husband's release from prison. She was asked by the Fenians to engage in another speaking tour to raise funds and she travelled the British Isles until December 1870 in this cause. The announcement of an amnesty for Fenian prisoners, which also meant the release of her husband, effectively ended her active political campaigning.<br>
<br>In January 1871 Mary Jane O'Donovan Rossa, with her husband and their son, returned to New York. She retired from political life and gave birth in all to thirteen children, seven of whom reached adulthood. She continued to write poetry, which was published in O'Donovan Rossa's paper the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>, and she substituted as editor for the paper during his frequent absences. She returned once to Ireland in 1905&#150;6, but on her contracting pneumonia O'Donovan Rossa decided to take her back to New York. When her husband's health deteriorated in 1911, she wrote regular reports about his condition in John Devoy's <span class="italic">Gaelic American</span>. When O'Donovan Rossa died in June 1915 she took his body to Ireland for burial. On her return to America she wrote a series of articles on her Irish experiences in 1915, which were published in the <span class="italic">Gaelic American</span> between September 1915 and January 1916. She now became very active in politics again and spoke at the Irish Race Convention in New York in March 1916. She also wrote political poetry, dedicated to the heroes of 1916, for the <span class="italic">Gaelic American</span>, and she worked as an adviser to nationalist organizations such as Cumann na mBan (&#145;Women's Council&#146;).<br>
<br>Mary Jane O'Donovan Rossa died unexpectedly of heart disease on 17 August 1916 at her home at 622 West 135th Street in New York city. Her body was taken to Ireland for burial beside her husband at Glasnevin cemetery in Dublin.<br>
