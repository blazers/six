<span class="headword">Maurice,  James Wilkes</span>  (1775&#150;1857), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Devonport on 10 February 1775. He entered the navy in August 1789 as able seaman on the sloop <i>Inspector</i>, and in 1793 was midshipman on the <i>Powerful</i>, which convoyed a fleet of Indiamen to the Cape of Good Hope. He afterwards served in the <i>Cambridge</i>, <i>Concorde</i>, and <i>Royal George</i>, all in the channel and off Brest, and on 3 April 1797 was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Glory</i>. In 1799 he was moved to the <i>Canada</i>. Having been appointed in September 1802 to the <i>Centaur</i>, he went out to the West Indies with Commodore Samuel Hood (1762&#150;1814) and was present at the capture of St Lucia, Tobago, Demerara, and Essequibo. He was landed at the destruction of a battery at Petite Anse d'Arlet on Martinique on 26 November 1803, when he was severely wounded by the explosion of the magazine. He was awarded a sword valued at &pound;50 by the Patriotic Society.<br>
<br>When the Diamond Rock, near the south-west end of the island, was occupied, armed (with three 24-pounders and two long 18-pounders), and commissioned as a &#145;sloop of war&#146; on 3 February 1804, Maurice was appointed to the command, and his promotion to commander was confirmed by the Admiralty to 7 May 1804. For more than a year Maurice held this rock, a thorn in the sides of the French at Martinique, and yielded to an attack in force by a detachment of Villeneuve's fleet (31 May&#150;2 June 1805) only when his ammunition and water were exhausted. In the three days the British lost two men killed and one wounded; the loss of the French, on the other hand, was severe, but has never been exactly stated. Maurice estimated it at seventy killed and wounded of the landing party alone, exclusive of those on board the ships and gunboats. Maurice was tried by court martial for the loss of his post, but was honourably acquitted and highly complimented on his conduct.<br>
<br>Maurice returned to England in August 1805 and was immediately appointed to the brig <i>Savage</i>, which after two years in the channel was sent to the West Indies. There, in the autumn of 1808, he was appointed by Sir Alexander Cochrane governor of Marie Galante, which had been seized in the previous March. On 18 January 1809 he was advanced to post rank.<br>
<br>In October 1809 Maurice was compelled by ill health to return to England, and in July 1810 he was appointed governor of the island of Anholt, in the Baltic, which had been captured, without difficulty, in May 1809 by a small squadron under the command of Captain Aiskew Paffard Hollis. The island had been found most useful as a trade depot and as a base for communicating with the continent, and when Maurice was appointed it was understood that neither Napoleon nor the Danes would lose any opportunity of recapturing it. It was garrisoned by about four hundred marines, commanded by Captain Torrens. As long as the weather remained open the British cruisers secured it from attack, as, afterwards, did the severity of the winter. As soon as the water was open an attempt was made by the Danes to retake it. Twelve gunboats convoyed the Danish transports, and in the early morning of 27 March 1811, in darkness and fog, a force of a thousand men was landed about 4 miles from the fort. The enemy were ignorant that the frigate <i>Tartar</i> and brig <i>Sheldrake</i> had arrived from England the day before; the Danish troops advanced to the assault, driving in the British advanced parties, while the gunboats fired on the coast defences. The <i>Tartar</i>'s approach made the gunboats withdraw. A small schooner attached to the island took up a position on the enemy's flank and drove them from behind the sandhills, while the direct fire from the fort was well sustained and deadly. Finding no retreat open, the Danes on the north side, to the number of 543, surrendered; the rest fled to the west end of the island, where, temporarily guarded by the reefs, they managed to board the gunboats and transports. These, however, were pursued and scattered by the British ships; four were captured and one was sunk. The loss to the Danes was heavy, but Maurice's conduct was much exaggerated in popular estimation. The decisive support of the <i>Tartar</i> and <i>Sheldrake</i> was ignored or unknown and the Danes' strength was much magnified. Maurice retained his governorship until September 1812. He had no further employment, and was retired with the rank of rear-admiral on 1 October 1846.<br>
<br>Maurice married, in October 1814, Sarah Lyne of Plymouth; she died in June 1815. Maurice died at his residence, East Emma Place, Stonehouse, Plymouth, on 4 September 1857, aged eighty-two. His career was unusual in that his two principal commands were islands.<br>
