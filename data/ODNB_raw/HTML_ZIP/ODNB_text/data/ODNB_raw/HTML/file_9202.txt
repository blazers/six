<span class="headword">Fauconberg,  Eustace  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1170&#150;1228), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of London</span>, derived his surname from Fauquembergues in Flanders. He was a younger son of Peter de Fauconberg, lord of Rise in Holderness, and probably of his wife, Beatrice. He must have had a university education since he is often entitled &#145;master&#146;, though also &#145;don&#146;, a style favoured by graduates of Bologna.<br>
<br>Eustace de Fauconberg first appears as a familiar of Godfrey de Lucy, bishop of Winchester, some time before 1192 and he succeeded him as a royal justice in 1199. He served on the bench steadily until October 1209, both at Westminster and on eyres. Altogether he sat in nearly half the counties of England, and was also often responsible for tallaging the king's demesnes. He was also entrusted with diplomatic missions to France and to Flanders in 1204. But on the pope's excommunication of King John, Fauconberg left royal service for nearly five years. By then he was a prebendary in St Martin's-le-Grand, London as well as rector of other churches. In 1214, after John's reconciliation with the church, Fauconberg reappears, not as a justice, but as the right-hand man of the new justiciar, Peter des Roches, whom John left to govern England in his absence on the continent. Between June and October of that year, when des Roches was away from Westminster, Eustace attested the justiciar's writs by which the realm was ruled. On John's return to England this arrangement terminated, and Fauconberg again disappears from the scene of political activity during the baronial rebellion and French invasion.<br>
<br>After peace had been made Fauconberg re-emerged, this time taking the important post of treasurer of the exchequer. He first occurs with the title on 4 November 1217, and he was to continue in the office until the end of his life. Assiduous in his attendance to his duties, he gradually brought order out of the chaos caused by the war. His reward was the bishopric of London, to which he was elected, though only after much acrimony, on 25 or 26 February 1221, the royal assent being given on 23 March. The papal legate confirmed the election, and the consecration took place at Westminster on 25 April at the hands of the bishop of Rochester, though again only after a great dispute over the officiand. Thenceforth Fauconberg was one of the magnates of the realm and took an active role in the councils of the government. He succeeded his predecessor in the custody of Colchester Castle, which he held until 1227. He participated in two diplomatic missions to France in 1223 and 1225, although Louis VIII was none too co-operative. After the siege of Bedford in 1224 Fauconberg was made responsible for the custody of Foulques de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; until he abjured the kingdom. He attested the fresh granting of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and the charter of the forest in 1225, and after the young king Henry III declared his majority in 1227, he frequently witnessed royal charters, though rarely away from Westminster and his duties at the exchequer. He was at work there only three days before his death.<br>
<br>Fauconberg was no mere <i>curialis</i>, however; he took seriously his responsibilities as a churchman. A unique glimpse of him ordaining clerks at Chelmsford in 1222 is preserved because a severe thunderstorm frightened the crowd. He had his episcopal court and, most unusually, dual officials, Master Reginald of Radnor and Master Robert d'Arches. His extant <i>acta</i> include an admission and institution of a rector, ordinations of settlements before papal delegates, confirmations of grants by his predecessors, indulgences for almshouses in Hereford and pilgrims to St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury, and a letter to Christ Church, Canterbury, promising that his consecration elsewhere would not prejudice their rights. Since the bishop of London was dean of the province of Canterbury, between the death of Archbishop Langton on 9 July 1228 and his own on 31 October of that year Fauconberg held metropolitan jurisdiction. It was presumably in this capacity that the king promised to hold him and his church harmless if he would renew the excommunication of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Considering his political opportunities Fauconberg exercised great moderation in enriching either himself or his church. He did, however, seek through the royal courts to recover alienations from his church's endowment. In courts Christian he sought to limit the exemption of Westminster Abbey from his diocesan authority, but the case was settled by a compromise. His relations with his chapter were harmonious, and his executors were three of the canons. When he died he was buried in his cathedral, a marble tomb was raised over his grave, and two chantries were established for the health of his soul. The chroniclers remembered him as a man commendable in all things, discreet, merciful, and jocund. He was also a man of taste: at the end of the century the treasury of St Paul's contained several <i>objets d'art</i> that had been his, most notably a great silver gilt morse or clasp, heavily jewelled, on which were figures of St Paul attended by two bishops; and a small gold cross, jewelled and containing wood of the true cross.<br>
