<span class="headword">Moor, Sir  Frederick Robert</span>  (1853&#150;1927), <span class="occ">politician in South Africa</span>, was born at Pietermaritzburg, Natal, on 12 May 1853, the eldest son of Frederick William Moor (<i>b</i>. 1830), a farmer and settler under the Byrne immigration scheme of 1850, and his wife, Sarah Annabella, the daughter of Robert Ralfe. He was educated at Hermannsburg School, near Greytown, Natal. As a young man of nineteen, he was attracted to the recently discovered diamond fields at Kimberley. There he met, and in 1878 married, Charlotte Mary St Clair Moodie (<i>d</i>. 1930), daughter of William James Dunbar Moodie and granddaughter of Donald Moodie, first colonial secretary of Natal. They had three sons and four daughters. Moor remained on the diamond fields for seven years. As the amalgamation and consolidation of claims gathered momentum, he realized that it would be increasingly difficult for the individual digger to prosper. Like many others, he sold out his claims, and in 1879 returned to Natal, where he farmed near Estcourt.<br>
<br>Moor's election on two occasions to the mining board in Kimberley fostered an interest in public life. In 1886 he was elected as member of the Natal legislative council for Weenen county. He attached himself to the party which advocated responsible government for the colony and, from 1893, when this was conceded, he served two terms as minister of native affairs (1893&#150;7 and 1899&#150;1903), interrupted by two years in opposition.<br>
<br>Moor resisted any modification of the long-standing policy of upholding customary law and the authority of local chiefs. He considered this essential&#151;under the supervision of white officials&#151;for the effective control of Natal's black majority. He consequently discouraged the granting of exemptions from customary law, disapproved of Cape Colony's non-racial franchise, opposed the acquisition of land by black people on freehold tenure, and wanted to extend governmental control over the mission reserves.<br>
<br>Subsequently, as leader of the opposition, Moor criticized the ministry of C. J. Smythe (1905&#150;6) for increasing the taxation of the black population, and particularly the ill-advised poll tax which sparked the uprising of February 1906. On succeeding Smythe as prime minister in November of that year, Moor's handling of the delicate situation created by the 1906 disturbance was unimpressive. The trial of the heir to the Zulu throne, Dinizulu ka Cetshwayo, provoked criticism in Britain and elsewhere. This tarnished Natal's image at the time of the &#145;closer union&#146; negotiations.<br>
<br>Moor consistently urged the necessity for some measure of unification in South Africa. He had been impressed by the enthusiasm he encountered as delegate for Natal to the inaugural ceremonies of the Australian commonwealth in 1901. He represented the colony at customs conferences in Cape Town (1898), Bloemfontein (1903), Pietermaritzburg (1906), and also in Pretoria (1908), where he wholeheartedly supported the proposal that a national convention should be held to formulate a draft South African constitution. Natal's white minority electorate favoured federation in preference to union but Moor and his colleagues were outvoted in the national convention which met at Durban in October 1908. He eventually approved the large discretionary powers granted to the union government, believing that public opinion would safeguard the interests of the provinces. His insistence that isolation would be suicidal in view of the colony's dependence upon the transit trade into the interior was persuasive, and in the referendum of June 1909 Natal accepted union.<br>
<br>In General Botha's ministry of 1910, Moor assumed the portfolio of commerce and industries, but he was defeated at the first election after union. His previous experience as minister of native affairs in Natal secured him a seat in the senate which he retained for ten years (1910&#150;20) before retiring to his farm, Greystone, near Estcourt, where he died on 18 March 1927. A funeral service was held the next day at St Matthew's Anglican church in Estcourt.<br>
<br>Moor was not a popular parliamentarian, even though he was a fluent speaker with a commanding physical presence, and a keen sportsman. His deep commitment to the interests of Natal was acknowledged by his opponents and his political services were rewarded with a privy councillorship on the occasion of the Imperial Conference of 1907, which he attended as premier of a self-governing colony. He was knighted on 1 January 1911.<br>
