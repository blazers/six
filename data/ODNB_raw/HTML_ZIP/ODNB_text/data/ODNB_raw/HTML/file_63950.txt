<span class="headword">Bather,  Elizabeth Constance</span>  (1904&#150;1988), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born on 11 October 1904 in Winchester, Hampshire, the daughter of the Revd Arthur George Bather, a housemaster at Winchester College, Hampshire, and his wife, Lilian Dundas Firth. She was educated at St Swithun's School, Winchester. From 1937 to 1946 she was a JP in Winchester, where she gained experience of young offenders, and she was also a member of Hampshire county council. She joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force at the beginning of the Second World War, and became a senior officer at Bomber Command before being posted to Canada to help set up the Canadian Women's Auxiliary Air Force. She reached the rank of group officer in 1944, and was appointed OBE in 1946 for her services to the force.<br>
<br>Despite her lack of police experience and her height (she was only 5 feet 4 inches tall), Elizabeth Bather was appointed in 1945 the first woman chief inspector in the Metropolitan Police Force of London, and after a year she succeeded Dorothy Peto as chief superintendent of the Metropolitan women police. She was promoted chief superintendent in 1949. The women police had grown out of the women patrols during the First World War, and had been started as an experimental force of 100 in 1919 with Sophia Stanley as the first superintendent, but in 1922 the government had decided to disband the whole force, and it was only as a result of Mrs Stanley's efforts, backed by the MPs Lady Astor and Margaret Wintringham, that a nucleus of twenty-five was retained, from which a new force could be built, and Dorothy Peto, appointed in 1930, could broaden the work of the force. Elizabeth Bather stressed the need for policewomen to be feminine, and was determined to recruit &#145;women of charm; women who can bring the gentle touch to a rough world&#146;. She had the uniform redesigned, and allowed policewomen to wear make-up on duty and in summer to go on duty without their tunics. She also encouraged women police to concentrate on juvenile crime and welfare matters, which continued to be the main focus of policewomen until the early 1970s. She gave evidence to the Wolfenden committee on homosexual offences and prostitution, which reported in 1957.<br>
<br>After her retirement in 1960 Elizabeth Bather served on the Hartley Wintney and Hart district councils in Hampshire from 1967 to 1976. A keen sportswoman, she rode, hunted, fished, and shot. Bather died on 8 January 1988 at Heathersides, Nately Scures, Hook, Hampshire. She was unmarried.<br>
