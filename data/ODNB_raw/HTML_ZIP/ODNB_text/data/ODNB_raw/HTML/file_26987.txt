<span class="headword">Tate,  Thomas</span>  (1807&#150;1888), <span class="occ">scientist and educationist</span>, was born at Alnwick, Northumberland, on 28 February 1807, the son of Ralph Tate, a builder. Along with his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26983/', "George Tate")</script> he attended the borough school in Alnwick, but unlike George he does not appear to have proceeded to the Dukes (Grammar) School. It is likely that he studied in Edinburgh for a short time with an architect, though J. P. Kay-Shuttleworth later referred to him as self-taught. His brother George ascribed his interest in mathematics and science to membership of the Alnwick Scientific and Mechanical Institution (founded 1825).<br>
<br>Tate's first experiences of teaching came from giving evening classes in Alnwick and Newcastle. In 1835 he was appointed lecturer in chemistry at the recently established York medical school. There, besides providing innovative evening classes on science, he also edited a weekly mathematical problem column in the <span class="italic">York Courant</span>. In 1840 he joined the staff of Battersea Teacher Training College and in 1849 he moved to the newly established Kneller Hall Training College in Twickenham as first master, with a salary of &pound;250, under Frederick Temple as principal. In 1851 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.<br>
<br>It was as an educator that Tate was most noted. He wrote more than twenty popular texts on various aspects of mathematics and science, including the <span class="italic">First Principles of Arithmetic, after the Method of Pestalozzi</span> (1845), which in various editions sold over 100,000 copies; a popular introductory text on the calculus (a topic that he introduced into the curriculum at Battersea); and the first volume of what was intended to be a multi-part <span class="italic">Mathematics for Working Men</span> (1856). His textbooks displayed his strong desire to demonstrate the usefulness of mathematical and scientific knowledge. He fought hard to establish teaching as a profession and to acquire status for it. To these ends he founded in 1853 the <span class="italic">Educational Expositor</span>, a periodical for teachers and all interested in education, and also became president of the newly created United Association of Teachers. His <span class="italic">Philosophy of Education</span> (1854) reached a third edition by 1860 and was also published in the USA. This book attempted to provide a balance of theory and practice in education. It shows Tate's debt to Francis Bacon, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746&#150;1827), and, above all, John Locke, and also his acceptance of the then fashionable faculty psychology, by which the various cognitive faculties could be cultivated by being exercised on appropriate subjects within the curriculum. Its original contributions relate to the debate on &#145;method&#146; in education, to an understanding of children's cognitive development, and to discussion of the qualifications of schoolteachers in relation to their professional duties.<br>
<br>Tate also did valuable work as a mathematician and scientist. He collaborated much with the noted engineer Sir William Fairbairn, for example in performing mathematical calculations required in the planning of the Britannia and Conwy bridges. Together they published several joint papers on topics related to engineering problems, and presented these to the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In addition Tate developed several of his own instruments and mechanisms, including &#145;Tate's double-piston air pump&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1855 Frederick Temple resigned his position at Kneller Hall after much criticism and inadequate government support, and the college was closed. In the following year Temple wrote to the committee of council on education to request a pension for Tate, whose health was in a poor state, and told it that:<blockquote>as an author and teacher he must be considered to stand quite at the head of his profession &hellip; It would be difficult to find any man who in proportion to his opportunities has done so much for education in this country. (<span class="italic">Minutes</span>, 32&#150;3)</blockquote>Within three weeks Tate was awarded a pension of &pound;120 per annum, and effectively his career as an educator was at an end.<br>
<br>Tate married twice but the last thirty years of his life are shrouded in obscurity. He died at his home, 51 Catherine Street, Liverpool, at the age of nearly eighty-one, on 18 February 1888, and was buried in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex. He was survived by his second wife, Lavinia, and three children, one of whom, George Tate, was an analytical chemist.<br>
