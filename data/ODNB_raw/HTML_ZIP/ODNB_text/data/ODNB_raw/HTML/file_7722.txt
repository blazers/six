<span class="headword">Docharty,  James</span>  (1829&#150;1878), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born at Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, the son of James Docharty, a journeyman calico printer, and his wife, Catherine. He was trained as a pattern designer at the School of Design in Glasgow, and thereafter he continued his design studies for some years in France where he may have seen the paintings of Gustave Courbet. On his return to Glasgow he began to practise on his own account, and was so successful that, in his early thirties, he was able to give up designing patterns and become a full-time landscape painter.<br>
<br>Docharty's earliest works were views of the village of Ardenadam on the lower Clyde and scenes of the lochs of the western highlands, which he exhibited at the Glasgow (later Royal Glasgow) Institute of the Fine Arts. Afterwards he extended his range of subjects on the Clyde, working also in Perthshire and painting in the more remote highland areas, such as in western Ross-shire and the Hebrides. He treated his landscapes with vigour and a direct naturalism achieved without artifice. His mature works are distinguished by the quiet harmony of their colour. Most of his paintings were exhibited in Glasgow, but he was also a regular exhibitor at the Royal Scottish Academy between 1864 and 1878, and also at the Royal Academy in London between 1865 and 1877. Among the most popular were <span class="italic">The Haunt of the Red Deer on the Dee, Braemar</span> (exh. RA, 1869) and <span class="italic">The Head of Loch Lomond</span> (exh. RA, 1873). His last exhibited works were <span class="italic">The Trossachs</span>, in the Royal Scottish Academy show of 1878, and <span class="italic">A Salmon Stream</span> in the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts exhibition in the same year.<br>
<br>In 1876, owing to his failing health, Docharty went abroad, making a lengthy tour through France, Italy, and Egypt, but without much benefit. Late in 1877 he was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy. He died of consumption at 7 Berlin Terrace, Pollokshields, Glasgow, on 5 April 1878 and was buried in Cathcart cemetery in that city. He was survived by his wife, Robina Bruce Lang. Most of his paintings entered private collections but he is represented in public collections in, for example, Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow, and Paisley.<br>
