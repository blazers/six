<span class="headword">Colet, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1505), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was a younger son of Robert Colet of The Hale, Wendover, Buckinghamshire. He was apprenticed in 1446 to John Colet, mercer of London, his own elder brother. His marriage, <i>c</i>.1465, to Christian, daughter of Sir John Knyvet of Buckenham Castle, Norfolk, and Alice Lynn of a London merchant family, gained him important contacts at court. Highly praised by Erasmus and Polydore Vergil, Christian was to survive her husband and children&#151;ten girls and ten boys, according to a window in St Antholin's Church&#151;and die in 1523. The only son to survive his father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5898/', "John Colet")</script>, scholar and dean of St Paul's, London.<br>
<br>Details of Colet's trade are few: trade with the clothiers of Essex, Suffolk, and Coventry may have supplied him with his main exports as a merchant adventurer; he also exported wool as a merchant of the Calais staple, and served as mayor of the staple of Westminster in 1499, 1500, and 1504. An alderman from 1476, Colet moved to Cornhill ward in 1487 where he stayed until his death. He served five times as master of the Mercers' Company, as MP for London in 1487 and 1489, and was twice mayor of the city. He was knighted during his first mayoralty of 1486&#150;7, a period which included the battle of Stoke. His second mayoralty of 1495&#150;6 coincided with war with Scotland and the Intercursus Magnus with the Netherlands, a treaty he facilitated by his personal bond when the city of London declined to proceed without further negotiations. He benefited from the Tudor accession and assisted the new king financially: he had a close relationship from 1480 at least with Reginald Bray (<i>d</i>. 1503), long-time servant of the king's mother and then of Henry VII himself; a book of hours of Bray's wife appears to have passed to John Colet, the dean; he sold an estate at Ditesworth, Leicestershire, to Lady Margaret Beaufort, which went to endow Christ's College, Cambridge; and he is reputed to have escaped the impositions associated with Empson and Dudley.<br>
<br>Colet was a parishioner of St Antonin's, London, when he died, and also of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, where his son John held the living and where he and his wife enjoyed a country retreat. He made his will on 27 September 1505 and died on 1 October at Stepney, where he and his widow were buried. He had bought lands in twelve counties (worth over &pound;170 p.a.) and in London, perhaps originally to provide for his large family. The death of his son Richard, aged about twenty-three in 1503, ended any hopes of a landed dynasty. The plans of his heir, John, to endow a school using the Buckinghamshire and Stepney lands in particular, may have met with Henry's approval, as he left &pound;100 for university exhibitions. His executors were his widow and son.<br>
