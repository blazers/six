<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hurley,  James Francis <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1885&#150;1962), <span class="occ">photographer and film producer</span>, was born on 15 October 1885 in Glebe, Sydney, Australia, the third in the family of three sons and two daughters of Edward Harrison Hurley, a typesetter at the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span> and a trade union official, and his wife, Margaret Agnes Bouffier, from a family of wine growers from Alsace Lorraine. At thirteen he ran away from home and found work as a fitter's handyman in R. W. Sandford's ironworks in Lithgow, where he spent two years before being transferred to work on a ship in the Sydney docks. He remained in Sydney, taking evening classes in engineering, and became a partner in a picture-postcard business in 1905.<br>
<br>When Douglas Mawson advertised for an official photographer to accompany the Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911 Hurley applied, and was accepted. On the <i>Aurora</i>, the expedition reached Cape Denison, in Commonwealth Bay, and set up a base from which to make sledging journeys during the Antarctic summer. Despite ferocious winds Hurley managed to take a series of dramatic photographs, including &#145;In the Blizzard&#146;&#151;a shot of two men trying to cut ice from a glacier&#151;and a panorama colour photograph of the foreshore of Commonwealth Bay, featuring penguins and sea elephants. He was one of the party of three that made an eight-week sledging expedition to the interior in November 1912 to make magnetic observations at the south magnetic pole. In the face of continuous blizzards and sub-zero temperatures, and suffering from snow-blindness and frostbite, he always remained cheerful: &#145;he was an ideal mate for such a trip. His fertile brain and imagination made a comedy of the most desperate situation&#146;  (Laseron, 199). An imaginative cook, his <i>tour de force</i> was the &#145;plum pudding&#146; that he concocted for Christmas dinner on the way back from the south pole, when rations were running low, by grating three biscuits with a saw, adding sugar and seven raisins flavoured with methylated spirits, mixing them with snow, and boiling them in an old sock over the primus stove. On his return to Australia in 1913 he put together his cin&eacute; film of the expedition, <span class="italic">Home of the Blizzard</span>.<br>
<br>It was the success of this film that led Sir Ernest Shackleton to invite Hurley in 1914 to join his Antarctic expedition, during which he hoped to cross the south polar continent on foot. Hurley made a photographic record of life on board the <i>Endurance</i>, the beauty of the Antarctic scenery, and the hardships suffered by the party after the destruction of the ship in the ice; these included a five-month drift on ice floes until they were able to launch the lifeboats and reach Elephant Island, where they waited while Shackleton took one of the boats to South Georgia to get help. The photographs show scenes of dogs being exercised on the ice, the crew playing soccer on the ice floe, seals being skinned to extract the blubber to fuel the stove that Hurley had created out of materials salvaged from the wreck, and the <i>Endurance</i> covered with rime on a moonlit night; he thought the ship was at its most beautiful &#145;when the bright moonlight etched her inky silhouette, or transformed her into a vessel from fairyland&#146;  (Hurley, 158&#150;9). He also filmed the <i>Endurance</i> as it was forced out of the ice and crushed by moving slabs of ice, and the masts crashing down before the ship eventually sank. Although Shackleton had made Hurley leave his glass negatives on board when they abandoned ship, he went back in before the ship broke up, and &#145;bared from head to waist probed in the mushy ice&#146; to retrieve them, only to be forced to select what could be stored in one tin; he was able to save only 150 out of more than 500, and smashed the remaining negatives lest he should change his mind. After his return he made a special expedition to South Georgia to take pictures for his book and to finish shooting the film of the voyage, <span class="italic">In the Grip of the Polar Ice</span>. He also printed his still photographs, often using &#145;combination printing&#146; to enhance their effect; these were montages made by superimposing several negatives to combine into one picture. He published his account of the expedition, <span class="italic">Argonauts of the South</span>, in 1925 and rewrote it as a children's book, <span class="italic">Shackleton's Argonauts</span> (1948).<br>
<br>In 1917 Hurley was appointed official war photographer to the Australian Imperial Force and given the honorary rank of captain, a title that he continued to use for the rest of his life. He covered the third battle of Ypres, and his colour slides are among the very few colour photographs of the First World War. Still making composite pictures, he superimposed clouds, exploding shells, and fighter aircraft onto the original images to increase the drama of the battle scenes, as in his most famous photograph of the war in France, &#145;Over the Top&#146;. In December 1917 he was sent to Cairo to cover the participation of General Chauvel's light horse in Allenby's drive on Jerusalem, and turned the film that he shot into <span class="italic">With the Australians in Palestine</span>. In Cairo, in April 1918, he married Antoinette Thierault, an opera singer, daughter of a French army officer and his Spanish wife, of Alexandria, whom he had met ten days earlier; they had three daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Having returned to Sydney, Hurley was asked by the Anglican missions to make a film about their work in New Guinea. The success of <span class="italic">Pearls and Savages</span> (later retitled <span class="italic">The Lost Tribe</span>), completed in 1921, led to tours of the United States in 1923 and England in 1924, during which he gave live commentaries during showings of the silent film; he also published <span class="italic">Pearls and Savages</span> as a book, in 1924. The Stoll Film Company financed his two feature films, <span class="italic">The Jungle Woman</span> and <span class="italic">Hound of the Deep</span>, which was filmed in New Guinea and released in 1926 to great acclaim.<br>
<br>After a year working as pictorial editor of <span class="italic">The Sun</span> in Sydney, in 1929 Hurley joined the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE), led by Sir Douglas Mawson, which was aiming to continue the exploration of the Antarctic region to the south of Australia and claim more territory for the British crown. Hurley was on both voyages of the <i>Discovery</i>, in 1929&#150;30 and 1930&#150;31. On the second cruise he was able to make a filming trip in a whaling cruiser while the <i>Discovery</i> was taking on coal, and also shot a film sequence of Mawson on a reconnaissance flight in bad weather. He made two films of these expeditions: <span class="italic">Southward Ho! with Mawson</span> (1930) and his first film with a soundtrack, <span class="italic">Siege of the South</span> (1931), &#145;in story, sound and song&#146;, billed as &#145;An Epic of Man's Glorious Struggle with Nature in the Frozen South&#146;.<br>
<br>After the success of these films Cinesound, in Sydney, appointed Hurley chief cameraman, and for the next eight years he wrote, filmed, and produced documentaries, as well as several feature films, including <span class="italic">Lovers and Luggers</span> (1937), which included underwater photography. His first documentary for Cinesound was <span class="italic">Jewel of the Pacific</span> (1931), about the inhabitants of Lord Howe Island; others included <span class="italic">Symphony in Steel</span> (1932), about the building of the Sydney harbour bridge (reviewers said he must have clung to every girder to get some of his shots); <span class="italic">Pageant of Power</span> and <span class="italic">Brown Coal to Briquettes</span>, both produced in 1935 for the state electricity commission of Victoria; <span class="italic">Oasis</span> and <span class="italic">Here is Paradise</span>, tourist films for the South Australian government, made in 1936; and <span class="italic">A Nation is Built</span> (1938), commissioned by the Australian government as part of the 150th anniversary celebrations.<br>
<br>In 1941, following the outbreak of the Second World War, Hurley was put in charge of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's photographic unit in the Middle East; he spent three years with the Australian forces there, making two-reel films to be shown on newsreels. <span class="italic">Advance into Libya</span> (1941) was the first film of the fighting in the western desert to be shown in Australia, and <span class="italic">The Siege of Tobruk</span> (1941) was shown all over the world. He was awarded the OBE in 1941. In 1943 the British Ministry of Information appointed him director of British army features and propaganda films; he travelled over 250,000 miles in the Middle East during the next three years, filming contributions for British newsreels and making documentary films, including <span class="italic">The Holy Land</span>, a history of Palestine under the British mandate.<br>
<br>Hurley returned to Australia in 1946, after six years in the Middle East, and embarked on a project to photograph its different regions; he produced a series of lavishly illustrated photographic books between 1949 and 1956, of which <span class="italic">Australia</span> (1955) ran to four editions. As he grew older he lost his joviality and became less sociable. Restless and tireless, he lived for photography and spent more time away from home than he did with his wife and family. He died on 16 January 1962 at his home, Stonehenge, Edgecliffe Boulevarde, Collaroy Plateau, Sydney. His wife survived him.<br>
