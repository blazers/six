<span class="headword">Catchpool,  (Egerton) St John Pettifor</span>  (1890&#150;1971), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born in Leicester on 22 August 1890, the sixth child and fourth son in the family of five sons and two daughters of Thomas Kingham Catchpool, hosiery manufacturer, and his wife, Florence Emma Pettifor. He was educated at Quaker institutions: Sidcot School and Woodbrooke College, Birmingham, where he took the social studies course. During the First World War his pacifist convictions led him to serve with the Friends' ambulance unit in France and then with the Friends' war victims' relief committee in Russia. He returned to England and took up the post of sub-warden of Toynbee Hall, the universities' settlement in the East End of London, which he held from 1920 to 1929, and he served also as a co-opted member of the London county council education committee from 1925 to 1931. In 1920 he married Ruth Allason, daughter of Henry Lloyd Wilson, chemical manufacturer. Trained as a doctor, she never practised, devoting her life instead to the care of their son and four daughters and to support of her husband's work.<br>
<br>The years in east London gave Catchpool an insight into the restricted lives of inner-city youth, and when in 1930 he was invited to become the first national secretary of the newly formed Youth Hostels Association, he readily accepted. &#145;This seemed just the movement&#146;, he wrote in a letter, &#145;to give scope for all my enthusiasms and even hobby-horses&#146;. He threw himself into the cause with immense energy, addressing meetings all over the country, persuading, lobbying, and begging for funds. He recruited G. M. Trevelyan, the historian, as president of the association, and William Temple, then archbishop of York, as vice-president. He secured financial support from the Carnegie Trust, the King George V Jubilee Trust, and, later, from the government's National Fitness Council. He acted as the focal point for the enthusiasm of many hundreds of volunteer workers of every social background up and down the country. Soon, tens of thousands of young city-dwellers, on bicycle or on foot, were enjoying their first taste of the countryside with the aid of the new network of youth hostels.<br>
<br>Catchpool also saw the importance of the youth hostels as centres of international contact and friendship among people. He worked closely with the German founder of the movement, Richard Schirrmann (later ousted by the Nazis), and with the idealists who were establishing youth hostels in other countries. In 1938 he was elected president of the International Youth Hostel Federation, an office which he held for the next twelve years. After his retirement as secretary of the English Association in 1950 he spent four years in India, encouraging the growth of youth hostels in that country, and subsequently paid two extended visits to Africa for the same purpose.<br>
<br>Catchpool (known to his friends as Jack and to his colleagues as Catch) combined the innocent enthusiasm of a child and the tenacity of purpose of a mature and deeply spiritual man, enlivened by a puckish sense of humour. Impatient with committee work, he was at his best when exploring new paths and communicating his enthusiasms to others. He was appointed chevalier of the Dutch order of Orange-Nassau in 1948 and CBE in 1951. Catchpool died in Welwyn Garden City, where his home was 17 Meadow Road, on 13 March 1971.<br>
