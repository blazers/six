<span class="headword">Delamotte,  William</span>  (1718&#150;1743), <span class="occ">Moravian evangelist</span>, born on 11 June 1718 in Greenwich, Kent, was the fourth of five surviving children (out of thirteen) of Peter Delamotte (<i>d</i>. 1749), a sugar merchant and JP, and his wife, Elizabeth (1685&#150;1771). His brother Charles (1714&#150;1796) accompanied the Wesleys and Benjamin Ingham to Georgia in 1735.<br>
<br>William matriculated as a sizar of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in May 1736. During a serious illness he resolved to lead a better life. At home at Blendon Hall, Bexley, Kent, during the 1737 summer vacation he was &#145;struck to the heart&#146; by Ingham's preaching  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Rev. Charles Wesley</span>, 74). Back in Cambridge he began a fellowship group whose members were soon &#145;stigmatized for Methodists&#146;  (Walsh, 257). When Charles Wesley expounded the Moravians' emphasis on justification by faith at Blendon in 1738 Delamotte initially resisted, but on 29 June he experienced the gift of the Spirit.<br>
<br>Delamotte's Cambridge group coalesced with another centred on Francis Okely. Visiting in December, Ingham found a vigorous group of five students and a society for townspeople. Delamotte supplemented Ingham's preaching in Bedford by expounding scripture in private houses, and may have continued to visit and advise the society which resulted. Having preached to huge crowds in London in 1739, at the Moravians' suggestion he assisted Ingham in the burgeoning Yorkshire revival from November. Delamotte's preaching was long remembered as producing many conversions. Back in Cambridge in October 1740, debts forced him to sell his books and furniture. By November 200 people were attending his thrice-weekly biblical exposition to the town society. However, only two fellow Cambridge Methodists remained in Cambridge, and one of these withdrew, rejecting lay exposition.<br>
<br>Delamotte was now asked to return to London, probably to fill the vacuum caused by the Wesleys' withdrawal from the Fetter Lane society. He was reluctant to leave his successful work among townspeople, but other undergraduates had begun to disrupt meetings and he felt isolated in college. He removed his name from the college books, but then illness intervened. A swelling which did not respond to treatment kept him at Blendon, and he became gravely ill. He was in London from August 1741, but improvements in his health proved only temporary.<br>
<br>In June 1742 Delamotte was received into membership of the Moravians' first English congregation, founded to take over Ingham's Yorkshire work. Despite continuing weakness, he travelled north that August. Living in a Moravian community house in the area of his earlier activity, he was deeply contented. He preached again, copied, and translated, helping to prepare the Moravians' 1743 <span class="italic">Watchwords</span> for publication. However, his running sore refused to heal. In January 1743 he returned to London, dying there on 22 February. He was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-East on 27 February. His sisters Elizabeth Holland (1710&#150;1780) and Esther Kinchin, later Schlicht (1712&#150;1779), remained prominent English Moravians.<br>
