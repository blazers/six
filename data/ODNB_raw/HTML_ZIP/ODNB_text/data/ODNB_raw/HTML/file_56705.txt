<span class="headword">Adderley,  Humphrey</span>  (1512&#150;1598), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born at Blake Hall, the family home, near Cheadle, Staffordshire, the fourth of seven children of Thomas Adderley (<i>c</i>.1480&#150;1538), gentleman and landowner, and his wife, Joan, daughter of John and Elizabeth Thirkill of Smallwood, Cheshire. The Adderley family was of considerable importance and antiquity in Staffordshire; it is through this connection that he probably became a groom of the wardrobe of the robes, and later a yeoman of the wardrobe of the robes from about 1530 to about 1570. The royal court had no permanent base and periodically moved on a circuit encompassing Whitehall, Nonsuch, Woodstock, St James's, Somerset Place, Oatlands, Richmond, Greenwich, Hampton Court, and Windsor. This was a journey of some 220 miles (excluding various progresses), and involved dedicated and meticulous planning, for which only a few people were intellectually suited. Adderley's service through the reigns of four monarchs illustrates his exceptional personal qualities which engendered long-lasting trust and discretion.<br>
<br>On 4 April 1562 Queen Elizabeth presented Henry, earl of Huntingdon, John Cholmeley, and Humphrey Adderley with Weddington Manor, Warwickshire, valued at &pound;30 19<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. (previously owned by Henry, duke of Suffolk), and the advowson of the rectory at Weddington. This was supplemented with Packington Heath Manor, Leicestershire, valued at &pound;20 6<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. and its capital messuage. By 1566 Adderley had become the sole owner of Weddington and its rectory and no longer held any rights at Packington. About 1566 he had Weddington Hall constructed in brick and local Attleborough sandstone. It was situated on a low ridge overlooking the River Anker flood plain and had uninterrupted views of the geologically unique and beautiful Oldbury&#150;Hartshill Ridge until the hall's demolition in 1928. This ridge featured numerous halls and granges, notably Dugdale's Merevale Hall; the views from the ridge were immortalized in Drayton's <span class="italic">Poly-Olbion</span>. Adderley's lands, which extended over 800 acres, were farmed by a mixture of arable and pasture. In addition he leased a parcel of land at nearby Higham on the Hill, Leicestershire, from the queen, who also gave him a black gown.<br>
<br>In 1571 Adderley married Anne North of Northampton. This union produced a daughter, Anne (<i>bap</i>. 20 May 1578), who married William Wightman of Wykin, Leicestershire. It is possible that his first wife died during or shortly after the birth of Anne. On 7 May 1581 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Capel of Rudgwick, Sussex. They had three children, including a son, Humphrey (<i>b</i>. 1583), who married Jane, daughter of Thomas Ward of Nunthorpe, Yorkshire; Jane (<i>b</i>. 2 Feb 1589) married the local antiquarian William Burton of Lindley; the youngest child was Katherine (<i>b</i>. 10 Jan 1594), who married Harvey Bagot of Blithefield, Staffordshire.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1598 Adderley died at Weddington Hall; he was buried in the churchyard of St James's Church, Weddington. His estate was perhaps &pound;2000 or &pound;3000 in value as deduced from the numerous bequests in his will. His legatees included Sir John Harington, a confidant of Elizabeth. The fourteenth-century vicar's vestry at St James's contains an alabaster plaque on the north wall summarizing his status in the royal household. His descendants are the barons Norton of Norton in the Moors, Staffordshire.<br>
