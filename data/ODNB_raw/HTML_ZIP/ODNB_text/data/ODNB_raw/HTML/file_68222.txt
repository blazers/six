<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gilliat, Sir  Martin John</span>  (1913&#150;1993), <span class="occ">army officer and courtier</span>, was born on 8 February 1913, the younger son and second of the three children of Lieutenant-Colonel John Babington Gilliat (1868&#150;1949), army officer and landowner, of Hertfordshire, and his wife, Muriel Helen Lycette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grinnell-Milne. Both parents came from banking families and Gilliat's paternal grandfather, John Saunders Gilliat (1829&#150;1912), was governor of the Bank of England. Gilliat was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before joining the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1933. He became his father's heir when a tiger killed his brother in India in 1935.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Gilliat served in the British expeditionary force and was mentioned in dispatches, before being captured at Calais in 1940. Until 1945 he was a prisoner of war, escaping four times. His first two escapes were from the marching column, heading to Germany. On his third attempt he remained free for a fortnight, almost reaching Hamburg. In 1943 he tunnelled his way out of Eichstadt, to be recaptured near the River Danube. He was then imprisoned in Colditz Castle, serving as adjutant to the senior British officer. A fellow prisoner, David Walker, noted his qualities of wit and unflappability. Though he remained in touch with his old comrades Gilliat avoided Colditz reunions in later life and was haunted by his memories and the experiences of his fellow prisoners. He suffered recurring nightmares for the rest of his life. He was appointed MBE in 1946.<br>
<br>Gilliat served in 1947 as deputy military secretary to Lord Mountbatten when he was viceroy and subsequently governor-general of India. He witnessed scenes of inhuman cruelty during the Delhi riots that preceded independence. In September 1947 he was wounded in the ear-pate and back when shots hit his car at point-blank range, during a night-time visit to a trouble spot in the Pahargunj area after dining with Mountbatten. He was invalided back to Britain. In due course he was delighted to be appointed comptroller to Malcolm Macdonald, high commissioner for the United Kingdom in south-east Asia, serving from 1948 to 1951, enjoying Macdonald's relaxed intelligence in contrast to Mountbatten's fussing about protocol and his &#145;ferocious flapping&#146;  (Gilliat to D. Walker, 16 Dec 1949, Walker papers). He then served as military secretary to Field Marshal Sir William Slim, governor-general of Australia from 1953 to 1955. As such he was to the fore during the visit of the queen and the duke of Edinburgh in February 1954, and was appointed CVO.<br>
<br>On the advice of his friend and contemporary Martin Charteris, a fellow green jacket, Gilliat was appointed private secretary and equerry to Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, in 1956, slipping into the job, as Charteris described it, &#145;like a prawn into aspic&#146;  (Charteris, memorial address). For nearly forty years he was responsible for all the queen mother's official duties, and he was one of the mainstays of her hospitable and almost Edwardian court. Relish for life permeated every quarter of the building, emanating from Queen Elizabeth, whom he invariably called &#145;my employer&#146;. All invited visitors were made to feel special, and if the hour of the day was appropriate their nerves were relaxed by what Charteris described as &#145;a fortifying drink pressed into their hands&#146;, poured out by Gilliat  (Charteris). He was responsible for many aspects of the queen mother's horse-racing career, and was himself an owner, training with Ryan Price. He was also the animateur of many private parties at Royal Lodge. He was particularly energetic at ensuring that Queen Elizabeth met and entertained leading figures from the worlds of the arts, business, the services, and racing, while Ruth, Lady Fermoy, one of her ladies-in-waiting, brought in musicians. He and Lady Fermoy were the leading lights of the queen mother's August house parties at the castle of Mey.<br>
<br>Gilliat was promoted KCVO in 1962, and GCVO in 1981. He was deputy lieutenant of Hertfordshire from 1963 (vice-lieutenant from 1971 to 1986), and a JP for that county, living for many years at Appletrees, near Welwyn. He was made an honorary bencher of the Middle Temple, and an honorary doctor of laws of the University of London, both in 1977. He held his alma mater, Eton, in high esteem, visiting the college regularly and paying for the painting of three leaving portraits, two by Derek Hill and one by Andrew Festing. He was a steward at Windsor racecourse, and at Kempton Park (later patron). He sat as a magistrate on the bench at St Albans crown court. He was also an &#145;angel&#146;, backing at least thirty plays on the London stage, and to him fell the sometimes complicated task of finding a suitable play for his employer to attend on her birthday.<br>
<br>By 1979 the possibility of Gilliat retiring was mooted by his friends, but he felt that since he was working for someone thirteen years his senior, he could not do so unless she wanted him to. She did not, and he was soon joking that she looked at him with amazement when at times his energy flagged. When the queen mother celebrated her ninetieth birthday in 1990 he predicted on television that she would reach her century, but wondered how many of the household would still be with her. He continued to serve even after his health collapsed, and he died, in office, of liver cancer, in London on 27 May 1993. He was unmarried.<br>
