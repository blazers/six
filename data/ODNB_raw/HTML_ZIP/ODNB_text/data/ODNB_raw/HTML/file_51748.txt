<span class="headword">Cooper,  Alice Jane</span>  (1846&#150;1917), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born in Cartwright Street, Doncaster, Yorkshire, on 4 August 1846, the eldest of the four daughters of the Revd John Thomas Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1877), a Unitarian minister, and his wife, Anne, formerly Barrow (<i>d</i>. 1892). Like many Unitarians she was deeply involved in education. Having succeeded in the new Cambridge higher local examination, she was second mistress from 1875 to 1876 at Notting Hill High School for Girls, one of the first two schools established by the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94164', "Girls' Public Day School Company")</script> in 1873. From 1876 until 1895 she was the first headmistress of Edgbaston High School for Girls, an early example of a proprietary high school for girls and the first to offer public secondary schooling to girls in Birmingham.<br>
<br>Alice Cooper entered fully into the objectives of the nonconformist &#145;industrial squirearchy&#146; of Birmingham that had established this non-sectarian school for girls to provide the best education available. Concerned with every aspect of school life, she refused to copy any narrowing contemporary educational practices. Establishing a broad curriculum, she discouraged cram and rote learning and disapproved of external examinations before the age of sixteen or seventeen. She did much to promote the very successful teaching of science at Edgbaston, although, as she pointed out in the 1894 <span class="italic">Journal of Education</span>, elsewhere girls particularly often suffered badly from the lack of scientific equipment.<br>
<br>Miss Cooper was also a pioneering headmistress in her encouragement of cricket and other games, callisthenics, gymnastics, Ling exercises, sensible clothing, and drama&#151;in 1889, for example, her correspondent Lewis Carroll saw a performance of <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span> at the school. She stimulated a variety of other extra-curricular activities, including a school magazine, <span class="italic">Laurel Leaves</span>, and founded The Link for old girls. She thus laid the foundations of a very successful, rapidly growing high school for the wealthier middle class, from which many girls left to join the increasing band of women university students.<br>
<br>The innovative attitudes of both headmistress and council of the school were shown in 1882 when Miss Cooper was sent to the USA to report upon educational methods there. In her detailed report on the large and varied number of educational institutions she visited, while not converted to common state primary schools, she extolled the schools' better equipment, separate classrooms, and specialized facilities, approved of the encouragement of questioning attitudes in pupils, and displayed a cautious preference for co-education.<br>
<br>Miss Cooper, like other women reformers, did much to promote the professional training of teachers for secondary education as her fellowship of the College of Preceptors and membership of the 1874 Association of Headmistresses illustrated (the latter met at Edgbaston High in 1889). She attended Edward Thring's conference of headmistresses at Uppingham in 1887. On the board of managers of the Birmingham Day Training College, established in 1890, she supported this method of training elementary teachers and, approving of greater links between elementary and secondary schooling, made the novel suggestion that high school girls could use such colleges and thence teach in the higher grade elementary schools. She wished to extend such training to secondary teachers, wanting all women teachers, public or private, to gain a university qualification. This would be followed by teacher training based on university departments and schools together, with public financial support if necessary. She also supported travelling scholarships for teachers, secretarial and commercial classes for women, and co-education in higher education. She argued strongly and often for the better payment of schoolmistresses and was one of the headmistresses who gave evidence to the Bryce commission on secondary education in 1894&#150;5. There she argued strongly for more equal funding for girls' schools, better science facilities, properly thought-out technical education for girls, and, above all, a good general, liberal education for girls of all classes, because girls gained less education than boys from their &#145;career in life&#146;. She also argued for local councils of education in large towns.<br>
<br>In 1895, to widen her educational activities, Alice Cooper resigned as headmistress. From 1891 to 1915 she was a member of the council of Somerville College, one of the earliest colleges for women in Oxford, and non-denominational. In 1897 she became tutor to women students taking the training course for teachers in secondary schools run by the Oxford University delegacy of local examinations, and was the first woman to be employed by an Oxford delegacy in an academic role. She was on the committee of the Association for Promoting the Education of Women in Oxford and by 1910 was assistant lecturer in education. Teacher training in Oxford took time to gain support, but Miss Cooper's teaching was reported to be &#145;highly appreciated by her students, men as well as women&#146;  (Delegacy for the Training of Secondary Teachers, <span class="italic">Memorandum for the Information of Members of Convocation</span>, 1912, 7). At her death Edgbaston High School endowed a bursary at Somerville for a former Edgbaston student intending to teach.<br>
<br>Miss Cooper's writings include &#145;On the training of the memory&#146;, a paper for the 1881 <span class="italic">Kindergarten Papers</span> of the Froebel Society (of which she was a member), in which she characteristically stressed the importance of a scientific basis for teaching and of questioning in learning. With E. A. Sonnenschein she wrote <span class="italic">Part II Analysis and Syntax of an English Grammar for Schools</span>, highly praised in the USA and in Germany. In 1890 a course book, <span class="italic">English Examples and Exercises</span>, was added, to which Miss Cooper contributed &#145;Part II analysis&#146;. She was one of only three women among the impressive array of authors in this <span class="roman">Parallel Grammar Series</span>.<br>
<br>In &#145;Technical education for girls&#146;, published in the Board of Education's <span class="italic">Special Reports on Educational Subjects</span>, 1896&#150;7, Miss Cooper examined how to make girls' technical subjects in higher grade schools &#145;organic parts of a well-ordered whole&#146;, a favourite subject of hers. She wanted homecrafts, including nursing, to be taught scientifically and interrelated with general subjects in order to produce skilled, self-reliant, resourceful craftswomen who would be able to make their adult leisure and home duties more interesting. She also wanted to introduce the teaching of citizenship as she had at Edgbaston. Although in some respects keeping to a gendered curriculum, therefore, Miss Cooper wanted all females to be prepared for the fuller life, duties, and occupations formerly reserved for men.<br>
<br>In appearance &#145;dowdy and grey&#146;, with rather square features, Miss Cooper had an invigorating personality, a gift for speaking, and a lively zest for knowledge and travel. She died suddenly at her home, Cestria, Ledborough Lane, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, on 17 June 1917.<br>
