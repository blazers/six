<span class="headword">Taylor,  Michael Waistell</span>  (1824&#150;1892), <span class="occ">physician and antiquary</span>, son of Michael Taylor, an Edinburgh merchant, was born at Portobello in Midlothian on 29 January 1824. He was educated at Portsmouth and matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1840, and he graduated MD in 1843. In the following year he obtained a diploma from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. While at Edinburgh University he made a special study of botany, and was appointed assistant to Professor John Hutton Balfour. Taylor was also one of the founders and early presidents of the Hunterian Medical Society. In 1844 he studied surgery at Paris for nine months, and afterwards he visited various foreign cities collecting botanical specimens.<br>
<br>In 1845 Taylor settled in Penrith in Cumberland, and soon after succeeded to the practice of Dr John Taylor. In 1858 he achieved distinction by ascertaining that scarlet fever might be caused by contamination of the milk supply. In the same year he married Mary, a daughter of J. H. Rayner of Liverpool. In 1868 he played a large part in founding the border counties' branch of the British Medical Association, and he was the second to hold the office of president. He was the author of many treatises on medical subjects, and in 1881 wrote an important article on the fungoid nature of diphtheria. He was a member of the Epidemiological Society.<br>
<br>Taylor was a member of the 1st battalion of the Cumberland volunteer corps, and he served as its staff surgeon. He also played an important part in the founding of the Penrith Literary and Scientific Society. Professionally he was no less known as an antiquary than as a physician. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 27 May 1886, and was a fellow of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries and a member of the council of the Royal Archaeological Institute. He joined the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society soon after its formation in 1866. Taylor made several important local discoveries, particularly of the vestiges of Celtic occupation on Ullswater, the starfish cairns of Moor Divock, the prehistoric remains at Clifton, and the Croglin moulds for casting spearheads in bronze. By the time of his death he had completed a very elaborate work, <span class="italic">Old Manorial Halls of Cumberland and Westmorland</span> (1892).<br>
<br>Taylor retired from medical practice in 1884. He died at his home, 202 Earls Court Road, London, on 24 November 1892, and was buried at Penrith in the Christ Church burial-ground. He left a widow, three sons, and three daughters.<br>
