<span class="headword">Brown, Sir  David</span>  (1904&#150;1993), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 10 May 1904 at 8 Princess Street, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, the younger son of Francis (Frank) Edwin Brown (<i>d</i>. 1941), joint managing director of David Brown &amp; Sons, gear manufacturers, of Huddersfield, and his wife, Caroline (Carrie), formerly Brook. He was educated at King James's School, Almondbury, and Rossall School, and joined the family business, founded by his grandfather in 1860, as an engineering apprentice in 1921, attending classes at Huddersfield Technical College. He married Daisie Muriel Firth in 1926: they had a son and a daughter. Divorced in 1955, Brown made two further marriages: in 1955 he married Marjorie Deans, and following their divorce in 1980 he married his former personal assistant, Paula Benton Stone (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1951).<br>
<br>Brown's early experience in the business included running the small Keighley Gear Company which the firm had acquired, and in 1928 he was sent to the United States, South Africa, and continental Europe to study new methods of gear manufacture. He was made a director in 1929, and in 1932 managing director, following the death of his uncle and his father's decision to confine himself to the chairmanship of the company. One of Brown's first decisions as managing director was in 1934 to buy a site at Penistone for a new foundry, and David Brown Foundries began making high grade steel, and steel castings, the following year. David Brown Tractors was formed in 1935, initially in partnership with Harry Ferguson, who later took his design to the Ford Motor Company. Working with a new designer, Brown launched his first tractor in 1939 at the Royal Agricultural Show, and moved the tractor company to a disused mill at Meltham to begin production.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the Park works in Huddersfield made gears for all types of machines and vehicles, and began to make aircraft gears for the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. The aero-gear division moved to Meltham in 1940, supplying gears for the Hercules engines of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and for Spitfires: at one point during the battle of Britain, Meltham was the only factory making Spitfire gears. Brown established a tank gearbox division at Meltham, at Penistone produced armour plating for Churchill and Cromwell tanks, and steel casing for the blockbuster high-explosive bomb, developed an aircraft foundry at Penistone to make castings for aero-engines, and made cables for the oil pipeline system for the Normandy landings.<br>
<br>The company continued to expand. In 1944 Brown bought the Muir Machine Tool Company of Manchester and moved the machine tool division there, where it made gear cutting and gear finishing tools which were exported all over the world. In the early 1950s David Brown Construction Equipment Ltd was formed to make industrial and earthmoving equipment. In 1951 all the businesses were brought into the new David Brown Corporation, with Brown as chairman and managing director and its headquarters in Huddersfield. A number of overseas subsidiaries were formed after the war, beginning in South Africa, where he set up David Brown S. A. (Proprietary) Ltd to import gears, and in 1955 David Brown Tractors (South Africa) Ltd to import and assemble David Brown tractors. He also set up companies in Ireland, Canada, and Australia, and in 1959 bought an interest in Foote Brothers of Chicago, a leading American gear manufacturer. There was another major reorganization in 1960 when ownership of the gear, foundry, and tool divisions was transferred to a new company, David Brown &amp; Sons (Huddersfield) Ltd.<br>
<br>David Brown bought Aston Martin for &pound;20,000 in 1947, after he saw an advertisement in <span class="italic">The Times</span> for the sale of an unnamed sports car company. A few months later he bought Lagonda, because he wanted the new 2.3 litre engine, designed by W. O. Bentley, Lagonda's technical director, for the Aston Martin chassis. Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd was founded at Hanworth Air Park, near Feltham, Middlesex, and the Aston Martin DB2, with a 2.6 litre version of the Lagonda engine, was launched in 1949. For a time the company continued to produce Lagondas but in 1958 it was decided to concentrate on selling one range of high-performance sports cars, the Aston Martin DB series, and the production of Lagondas ceased. Although the marque was revived from 1961 to 1965 with the new 4 litre Lagonda Rapide, it was never as popular as the Aston Martin DB4, launched in 1958, the first British car capable of speeds of up to 140 m.p.h. Brown bought Tickford Ltd, of Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, a bodybuilding plant, in 1954, and in 1957 all Aston Martin Lagonda car production was moved there, and the other departments in 1964.<br>
<br>A win at the 1948 twenty-four hour sports car race at Spa, in Belgium, led David Brown to enter the motor racing world in earnest in 1950, when he appointed John Wyer as racing team manager, with the ambition of winning the Mille Miglia, and the Le Mans twenty-four hour race. While racing successes undoubtedly brought prestige for the whole David Brown group&#151;from 1955 the cars were advertised as &#145;David Brown Aston Martins&#146;&#151;racing also gave the designers and engineers the opportunity to test new cars and obtain technical information. However, during the 1950s racing cars became less and less like the models available to the public, until to compete at all it was necessary to develop and build a totally different car. In 1955 Wyer created separate design offices for the competition and road cars, and the DBR1 was built especially for racing. The Aston Martin team, led by Stirling Moss, won at Le Mans in 1959, and went on to win the World Sports Car Championship the same year, the first British car manufacturer to do so. Even so, following these wins Brown decided to withdraw from sports car racing and concentrate on the development and manufacture of production cars, and in 1960 he pulled out of grand prix racing as well. Despite the enormous publicity surrounding the use of an Aston Martin DB5 in the James Bond film <span class="italic">Goldfinger</span> in 1964, with special features such as a passenger ejector seat and chariot scythes, the company was unable to reap the benefits as the factory was only able to make eleven of the hand-assembled cars a week. Brown always claimed that he had bought Aston Martin as a hobby, and it never made a profit.<br>
<br>David Brown was knighted in 1968, but by the early 1970s the David Brown Corporation was in severe financial difficulties. In 1971 he was removed from executive control for a year by the bankers supporting the corporation, and in 1972 he sold David Brown Tractors, following a drop in worldwide tractor sales, and then Aston Martin, saddled with &pound;5 million debts. After his shipbuilding company, Vosper Thorneycroft, was nationalized in 1978, he resigned from the chairmanship of the David Brown Corporation and moved to Monte Carlo. He died on 3 September 1993 in Monte Carlo, Monaco, and was survived by his third wife.<br>
