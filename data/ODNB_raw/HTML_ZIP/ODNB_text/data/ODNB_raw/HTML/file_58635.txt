<span class="headword">Mullen,  Madeleine  ffrench-</span>  (1880&#150;1944), <span class="occ">medical officer and hospital administrator</span>, was born in Malta in 1880, the eldest of three children, one son and two daughters, of fleet surgeon St Laurence ffrench-Mullen RN and his wife. Her mother suffered ill health for a number of years after her birth and Madeleine was placed in the care of her maternal grandmother in Ireland. When her father retired the family returned to Ireland. Madeleine's father was an ardent Parnellite and local elections were run from the family home at Dundrum in co. Dublin. After his death in the 1890s the family travelled on the continent, living in Germany and Belgium. ffrench-Mullen, who had been living in Brussels at the outbreak of the First World War, returned to Dublin in 1914.<br>
<br>In Dublin ffrench-Mullen looked after Belgian refugees and became active in the Irish nationalist movement. She became acquainted with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57724/', "Dr Kathleen Lynn")</script> and the two women soon became firm friends. In 1915 ffrench-Mullen went to live with Lynn at her home in Rathmines in Dublin. She remained there until her death. Lynn and ffrench-Mullen were introduced by the writer, actress, and nationalist, Helena Molony, to the Irish Citizen Army which had been formed by the socialist and trade unionist James Connolly during the 1913 lock-out in Dublin. Both women became active in the army. ffrench-Mullen became a sergeant and Lynn was appointed its chief medical officer. In the 1916 rising ffrench-Mullen was in the St Stephen's Green garrison where she was in command of the first aid station. She was arrested after the rising and spent a number of weeks in Arbour Hill and Kilmainham gaols and then in Mountjoy prison. On her release from prison she helped to establish the Connolly Co-operative Society in Liberty Hall, Dublin. Its purpose was to give employment to workers whose livelihoods had been lost in consequence of their role in the rising. In 1919 she was returned as a Sinn F&eacute;in candidate to the Rathmines urban district council. She was also active in Cumann na dTeachtaire (League of Women Delegates), a group interested in political affairs and the health issues of women and children.<br>
<br>During the influenza epidemic she, along with others, organized an emergency hospital in Charlemont Street, Dublin. In 1919 she also helped to establish St Ultan's Hospital in the city. Originally it was proposed that a hospital be established to treat children who suffered from venereal diseases, the fear being that venereal disease would become rife on the return of soldiers from the front. The committee of the hospital was part of a group known as Slainte na nGaedeal (Irish Health) which was concerned with the health of the nation. However, the hospital was organized as a general one for children, although it was also concerned with the health of mothers, who were encouraged to attend lectures at the hospital. ffrench-Mullen acted as secretary to the hospital for twenty-five years before her death. She drew up its annual reports, planned its housing schemes, and visited the United States on fund-raising trips. She was secretary to the Ultan Utility Society, which built homes for the people whose tenement lodgings were demolished for the enlargement of the hospital.<br>
<br>ffrench-Mullen died suddenly in a Dublin nursing home, on 26 May 1944, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery in the city four days later.<br>
