<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Maurice  fitz Thomas</span>, fourth earl of Kildare  (<em>c.</em>1322&#150;1390), <span class="occ">magnate and justiciar of Ireland</span>, was the youngest of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9583/', "Thomas fitz John Fitzgerald, the second earl (d. 1328)")</script>, and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1359), a daughter of Richard de Burgh, earl of Ulster. He was born about 1322 and was generally known as Maurice fitz Thomas. On the death of his brother Richard, the third earl, in 1331, Maurice became heir to the Kildare inheritance, which included manors in Limerick as well as the primary cluster of lands in Kildare and Offaly. His mother had married, secondly, in 1329 John Darcy, justiciar of Ireland and later steward and chamberlain to Edward III; Darcy received custody of the Kildare lands in 1334. Maurice was given their keeping in 1340 and had livery of his inheritance in April 1342, when the Dublin government questioned whether he was quite of full age.<br>
<br>Kildare's early public career was stormy. In August 1345 he was arrested at a council meeting in Dublin by William Burton, an English knight in the retinue of Ralph Ufford, the justiciar, on Ufford's orders. Ufford was in Munster on campaign against the unruly earl of Desmond. In October 1344 the pope had given permission for Kildare to marry Desmond's daughter, and it seems likely that Ufford feared an alliance between them. The Dublin annalist, bitterly hostile to the justiciar, condemns the arrest as treacherous. The earl's imprisonment was followed by the judicial resumption of the liberty of Kildare, which neither he nor his successors succeeded in recovering. Earl Maurice remained in custody until May 1346, a month after Ufford's death, when he was released on the surety of leading families of Kildare, in order to participate in a campaign against the &Oacute; M&oacute;rdha family of Leix (Laois), and on condition that he would afterwards go to England. In the event his departure was delayed until May 1347 and his destination was the siege of Calais, to which he led a force of Kildare gentry.<br>
<br>This episode marked a turning point in the earl's career. Edward III moved quickly to repair the damage to political relationships during the period of Ufford's rule, and the rehabilitation of Kildare was a priority. After the fall of Calais he seems to have remained at court and was knighted by the king during the Christmas festivities at Guildford in 1347. Arrangements were in train for his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of Bartholomew Burghersh (currently the king's chamberlain) and his wife, Elizabeth, who, as one of the daughters and coheirs of Theobald de Verdon, held property in Meath and Louth. On her marriage to Kildare, Elizabeth Burghersh was provided with a jointure of 500 marks in Ireland. In April 1348, &#145;for his good service in foreign parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1348&#150;50</i>, 56), Kildare was pardoned the offences of which he was said to stand indicted. These were never specified, the Dublin government telling Edward III that Ufford had kept them secret, intending to inform him about them personally. From this time onwards, despite a dispute in 1355 with the justiciar, Thomas Rokeby, over the earl's alleged failure to contribute as he should to defensive operations in the Kildare marches, relations with the authorities were generally good. He tried to maintain and exploit his connections with the English court and government, seeking, for example, to recover his liberty rights by an approach to William Wykeham, the chancellor, in 1367. Based at Kildare and Maynooth, he was an obvious candidate to fill gaps in the succession of justiciars, and he acted as justiciar or deputy for short periods in 1355, 1356, 1357, 1360&#150;61, 1372, and 1376. Although he refused office in October 1379, this was an action taken by other magnates at the same period because of the underfunding of Irish government.<br>
<br>As well as playing a role in royal administration, the earl was a warrior and diplomat on his own account, maintaining a zone of influence in the Irish midlands. Documents preserved in the <span class="roman">Red Book of Kildare</span> reveal him between 1349 and 1368 entering into compacts with prominent members of the settler and native lineages of, for example, Bermingham, Mac Eochac&aacute;in, &Oacute; D&iacute;omusaigh, and &Oacute; Conchobhair of Offaly. Typically, he offered land, favour, and support in return for rents and military service. In his role as a marcher lord, he provided essential protection for the settler communities of east Kildare and Dublin.<br>
<br>Earl Maurice visited England in 1379 and appears to have remained active well into his sixties. In 1387, as the most senior magnate in Ireland, he was appointed to arbitrate in disputes that had arisen between the earls of Desmond and Ormond. He died in 1390, after May, and was buried in Holy Trinity Cathedral, Dublin. Gerald Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1432), the eldest of his three legitimate sons, succeeded him.<br>
