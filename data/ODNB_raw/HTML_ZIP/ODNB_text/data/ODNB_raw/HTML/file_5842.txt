<span class="headword">Coldock,  Francis</span>  (1530/31&#150;1603), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, &#145;by birth a gentleman&#146; (so runs his widow's monument), was apprenticed to William Bonham on 13 October 1556, but may have already served some years before then. He was made free of the Stationers' Company on 2 December 1557 and began to take apprentices on 6 July 1558. He served as under-warden in 1580 and 1582 and as upper warden in 1587 and 1588, and was twice master, in 1591 and 1595.<br>
<br>The first reference to Coldock in the Stationers' register is for Bishop Bale's <span class="italic">Declaration of E. Bonner's Articles</span> in 1561, which was printed for him by J. Tisdall. In the same year Coldock was fined 2<i>s</i>. &#145;for that he ded revyle Thomas Hackett with unsemely wordes&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 183), as well as on other occasions for keeping open on St Luke's day and during sermon time. He was taken into the Stationers' Company livery on 29 June 1570, and became one of the largest dealers in books in London. In 1577 he was one of those who signed the petition setting forth their grievances from the various book monopolies, presented by the stationers and printers to Queen Elizabeth. He first had a shop in Lombard Street, &#145;over agaynste the Cardinalles hatte&#146;, and afterwards in St Paul's Churchyard at the sign of the Green Dragon. He was a benefactor to the Stationers' Company, presenting on 4 August 1589 &#145;a spoone gilt poiz. 3 oz. 3s. or thereaboutes with his name on it&#146;, on being made warden, and in 1591 &#145;a silver college pot&#146; on being made master. He died on 13 January 1603 aged seventy-two, and was buried in the vault of St Faith, in the crypt of St Paul's. His will, dated 3 September 1602, left equal portions of his estate to his wife and his daughter Joan, who had married the bookseller William Ponsonby.<br>
<br>On Coldock's widow's monument in the church of St Andrew Undershaft is this inscription:<blockquote>Near &hellip; lieth Alice Byng, in a vault with her father, Simon Burton. She had three husbands, all bachelors and stationers. Her first was Richard Waterson, by him she had a son. Next him was Francis Coldock, by birth a gentleman; he bare all the offices in the company, and had issue two daughters, Joane and Anne, with whom she lived forty years. Lastly, Isaac Byng, gent., who died master of his company. She died the 21st day of May <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span> 1616, aged 73 yrs. 5 months and 25 days. (J. Stow, <span class="italic">A Survey of London</span>, ed. J. Strype, 1754, 1.400)</blockquote>
