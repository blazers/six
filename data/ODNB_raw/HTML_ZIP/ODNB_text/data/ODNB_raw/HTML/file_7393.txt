<span class="headword">Deane,  William Wood</span>  (1825&#150;1873), <span class="occ">architect and painter</span>, was born on 3 or 22 March 1825, in Liverpool Road, Islington, London, the third son of John Wood Deane, a bank cashier and painter, and his wife, Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glasse (1784&#150;1859), whose father had been mayor of Barnstaple. He attended the Islington proprietary school until 1842, and won prizes for mathematics, perspective, and French. He showed an early taste for drawing, but as his elder brother Dennis had become an artist, his father determined to make him an architect. On 7 September 1842 he was articled to Herbert Williams, a surveyor. On 13 January 1844 he became an architectural student of the Royal Academy, and in December 1844 he won the academy's silver medal. He continued to exhibit both designs and, later, drawings at the Royal Academy throughout his life. On 21 July 1845 he was awarded the students' book prize for a design at the Institute of British Architects. After completing his articles, in 1846, he became an assistant to David Mocatta (1806&#150;1882) for a short time. He became an associate of the Institute of British Architects in 1848.<br>
<br>In 1844 or thereabouts Deane became involved with private theatricals, and played at Frances Kelly's Royal Soho Theatre at 73 Dean Street, Soho (afterwards the Royalty; dem. 1954), which he subsequently decorated. In 1850 he went to Italy with his brother Dennis and while in Rome became a friend of the painter George H. Mason ARA. He returned to London in late 1851 with his folios full of measured drawings and watercolour sketches. He gave lessons in watercolour drawing to young architects, and started practising as an architect in partnership with Alfred Bailey, a surveyor, at 13 Great James Street, Bedford Row. Though the partnership broke up in 1855, Deane's early work, including Langham Chambers, showed great promise. He abandoned architecture in 1857, however, for drawing on wood, and making designs and perspectives for architects. He married Ellen Maria, sister of the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30356/', "George Aitchison")</script>, who later became president of the Royal Institute of British Architects and acted as Deane's executor.<br>
<br>Deane spent most of his summers sketching in the country: he travelled in 1856 to Normandy, in 1857 to Belgium, and in 1859 to Whitby. On his mother's death in September 1859 he inherited a small sum of money, and determined to devote himself to painting. He moved to 17 Maitland Park Terrace, Haverstock Hill, in 1860, and spent a good part of the year sketching in Cumberland. He was elected an associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1862, and became a member in 1867. He also exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Dudley Gallery, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>In May 1865 Deane left for Venice, intending to settle in Italy, but he returned in October of the same year, and went to live at 64 King Henry's Road, Primrose Hill, London. His watercolours of <span class="italic">The Rialto</span> and <span class="italic">The Interior of Sta Maria dei Miracoli</span> showed greater technical ability than his previous sketches. In 1866 he travelled in Spain with the watercolourist Francis William Topham. The oriental character of Spain seems to have acted as a spur to his powers; his drawing of <span class="italic">The Gates of the Alhambra</span> was one of his most brilliant works. <span class="italic">The Fair at Seville</span>, with its lines of tents, clouds of dust, and picturesque horsemen, and his <span class="italic">Bull Ring at Seville</span>, with its brutal crowd in the shade, and the blazing sunshine in the arena, raised his art from the tranquil portraiture of stately buildings and a pearly atmosphere to a higher and more imaginative level. Every year he went to France, Germany, or Italy, and made elaborate studies of the subjects he meant to paint. His drawings were mainly of architectural subjects, and were distinguished by the purity of their colour, their pearly greys, and the effects of sunlight, though he is sometimes considered to have been over-lavish in his use of bodycolour. Among his fellow artists he was called an impressionist.<br>
<br>In 1870 Deane was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. In the autumn of that year poor health caused him to visit Scotland, though in 1871 he still managed to produce drawings of <span class="italic">Sta Maria della Salute</span>, <span class="italic">Jedburgh Abbey</span>, and <span class="italic">The North Porch of Chartres</span>. In 1872 he went to Florence, Verona, and Perugia, and made a beautiful drawing of the basilica of S. Miniato, which was not exhibited until after his death. In 1873 he was posthumously awarded a medal at the Vienna exhibition for <span class="italic">The Bull Ring at Seville</span>. Examples of his work may be seen in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Wakefield Art Gallery, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Deane died at the age of forty-seven at his home, 64 King Henry's Road, Primrose Hill, on 18 January 1873 of cancer of the liver, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
