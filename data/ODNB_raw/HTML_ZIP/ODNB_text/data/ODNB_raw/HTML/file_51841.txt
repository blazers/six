</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dorman, Sir  Maurice Henry</span>  (1912&#150;1993), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 7 August 1912, the elder son of John Ehrenfried Dorman, of Eastgate, Stafford, an engineer with W. H. Dorman &amp; Co., and Madeleine Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bostock, dentist. Her family owned Lotus Shoes. From Sedbergh School Dorman went up to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he took a lower second class in history. On graduation he applied for the colonial service and in 1935 was posted to Tanganyika as an administrative cadet. After only ten years' service, during which he had caught his superiors' eyes by his work as clerk of councils in Tanganyika from 1940 to 1945, he was singled out as assistant to the lieutenant-governor of Malta, the civilian deputy to the traditionally armed forces holder of the governorship of that &#145;fortress&#146; colony. Already on the fast track, Dorman was promoted in 1947 as principal assistant secretary in Jerusalem, where the Palestine mandate was in its final stormy years. In 1948 he was seconded to the Colonial Office to take charge of the rapidly expanding social services department. With a successful tenure behind him, Dorman was posted to the Gold Coast in 1950, as director of social welfare and community development. By now his reputation was such that in 1952 he was chosen as colonial secretary of Trinidad and Tobago, conventionally a Colonial Office proving ground for potential governors. In 1956 the plum colonial service promotion to a governorship came with his appointment to Sierra Leone.<br>
<br>West Africa was already embarked on its decade of decolonization, but unlike its near neighbours Gold Coast and Nigeria, the relatively sleepier Sierra Leone (despite its conspicuous Creole &eacute;lite in the capital, Freetown) was not yet prey to the exuberance of colonial nationalism. Dorman's principal political challenge was to encourage the up-country protectorate into a closer relationship with the sophisticated colony area, while at the same time ensuring that the stimulated advance towards self-government was not accompanied by any breakdown in law and order. His outstanding tact, empathy, and emphasis on good relations with the emergent political leadership were evidenced in 1961 by the request of the newly independent government of Sir Milton Margai that Dorman should stay on as the country's first governor-general. Nor was this a mere token of courtesy, for despite the constitutional fact that the post was a figurehead devoid of any executive power, Dorman's advice was in the event frequently sought, discreetly given, and often quietly taken. Coincidentally, Dorman's younger brother Richard was to become Britain's deputy high commissioner in Freetown in 1964.<br>
<br>By then Dorman had left. Dramatic political changes in Malta brought him back to the island in 1962. The years of political stalemate had been broken by the success of Dr Borg Olivier at the polls, a political outcome reinforced by the economic threat of the likely reduction of Britain's historic naval presence in Malta. Perceiving that what was needed was firm guidance from a civilian at the helm rather than the conventional military appointment, the Colonial Office turned to Dorman, with his proven diplomatic skills and personal experience of the art of the transfer of power. Once again his natural humanity and enlightened attitude secured local confidence, to such an extent that despite several trials and tribulations he found himself genuinely identifying with the Maltese. Once more, as in Freetown in 1961, Dorman was invited, at Malta's independence in 1964, to become the island's first governor-general. Remarkably, he remained in office for seven years, not leaving until 1971 when the new prime minister, Dom Mintoff, requested a local appointment. During his tenure Dorman turned the conventional role of the queen's representative upside-down, by speaking out against the defence cuts threatened by Britain and, to the dismay of Whitehall, declaring that he stood &#145;four square&#146; with the government and people of Malta in their dispute with London.<br>
<br>Dorman's long service overseas was not yet finished. He was deputy chairman of the abortive Pearce commission in 1971&#150;2 assessing African opinion on the Rhodesian government's constitutional proposals. He was to return to Rhodesia in 1980 as chairman of the British observer group monitoring the election which led to the independence of Zimbabwe.<br>
<br>After thirty-six years in the colonial service Dorman was ready to settle in England. With his wife, Florence Monica Churchward Smith (<i>d</i>. 1993), daughter of Montagu Smith of Devon, whom he had married on 4 December 1937 and with whom he had one son, John, and three daughters, he settled in Wiltshire. He turned his administrative talents to health administration, spending the next decade as chairman of the Swindon hospital management committee and then of the Wiltshire (and later the Swindon) Health Authority. He was a trustee of the Imperial War Museum and chairman of the West of England Building Society, and also life governor of Monkton Combe School and president of the Old Sedberghians' Club. From 1972 to 1975 he was deputy lieutenant for Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Dorman's colonial service was recognized by his appointment as CMG in 1955; he was advanced to KCMG in 1957 and to GCMG as well as being made GCVO in 1961. A committed Christian, Dorman and his wife were both active in the order of St John, whose fortress home had long been in Malta. He was successively chief almoner and chief commander of the St John Ambulance Brigade, becoming lord prior in 1980. He was also made knight grand cross of the Maltese order of merit. Academic honours included honorary degrees from Durham University and the Royal University of Malta. His hobbies he recorded as &#145;once sailing, squash, and sometimes golf&#146;  (<span class="italic">WWW</span>). He and his wife were deeply appreciated in Malta as patrons of the arts, and regularly made the Palace of San Anton available to the local dramatic society. On retirement they built a private house at Fawwara in the hope of spending part of each year in Malta.<br>
<br>Although Dorman's career spanned the transition from the high noon of empire, when he was a district officer in Tanganyika, through the transfer of power, in which he was the last colonial governor of Sierra Leone, to the emergence of the Commonwealth, where he was the first (and last) British governor-general of an independent Malta, his part was never that of the typical pro-consul of empire. Throughout he combined the professionalism of a colonial administrator with the enlightenment and empathy of a constitutional monarch. He accepted and accomplished the challenge, as his colonial service peer Lord Grey put it, &#145;to look and play the part and achieve by personality what had hitherto been won by laying down the law&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 10 Nov 1993). He was not only one of the last distinguished overseas career civil servants, he was also one of that handful of adaptable final colonial governors whose emollient yet fundamentally firm and fair role and capacity for personal friendship with the nationalist leadership were instrumental in effecting a smooth and mutually respecting transfer of power.<br>
<br>Dorman died of cancer at his home, the Old Manor, Overton, Wiltshire, on 26 October 1993. His widow, appointed dame of the order of St John of Jerusalem in her own right in 1968, died six weeks later.<br>
