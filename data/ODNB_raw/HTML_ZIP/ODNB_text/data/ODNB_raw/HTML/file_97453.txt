<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Harris,  Ralph</span>, Baron Harris of High Cross  (1924&#150;2006), <span class="occ">economist and free-market polemicist</span>, was born on 10 December 1924 at 88 Langham Road, Tottenham, London, one of four children of William Henry Harris (<i>d</i>. 1941), bus inspector, and his wife, Lilian Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vall&eacute;. He was educated at Tottenham grammar school, and won an exhibition to Queens' College, Cambridge, where he read economics, attaining a first in 1948. At Cambridge he was influenced by Stanley Dennison, a classical economist fighting against the Keynesian message of fettered markets and government macro-economic controls.<br>
<br>After graduating Harris worked for Conservative central office, first as an education officer for the newly formed Conservative Political Centre and then for the Conservative research department. In 1949 he moved to St Andrews University, where he lectured in political economy with great success until 1956. On 5 November 1949 he married Jos&eacute; Pauline Jeffery, the 22-year-old daughter of Roger Frederick Jeffery, manufacturer. They had a long, happy marriage, which produced two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>During his time in Scotland Harris unsuccessfully contested two parliamentary seats; the first in Kirkcaldy for the Liberal Unionist Party in 1951 and the second in Edinburgh for the Conservatives in 1955. It was also the beginning of a long association with the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>; he started as a leader writer in 1956 and continued to contribute to the paper for the rest of his life. During his time in Scotland he wrote his first book, <span class="italic">Politics without Prejudice</span>, a political appreciation and biography of R. A. Butler, then thought of as a possible future leader of the Conservative Party.<br>
<br>It was after a speech in 1949 given by Harris for the Conservative Political Centre in East Grinstead that Antony Fisher first mentioned to Harris his discussion with Friedrich Hayek on the setting up of an &#145;anti-Fabian&#146; think tank. It was then clear to Fisher that Harris had the necessary persuasive powers to convince a wider audience of the free-market message. Nearly eight years later, in January 1957, Harris started work at the newly formed Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), having resigned from St Andrews in the preceding spring. It was a risky move, with the IEA's influence and financial security yet to be established. In his typically self-deprecating manner, he later reflected on his decision to give up a secure academic career with a potential move across the River Tay to an academic chair at Queen's College, Dundee, in the offing:<blockquote>[a] moment of thought was enough for me to conclude that, even if the Dundee job were offered me on a plate, I would have turned it down &hellip; I could not imagine I would ever be qualified for such a rarefied academic distinction. (<span class="italic">Harris in his Own Words</span>, 19)</blockquote>Harris's role as general director of the IEA from 1957 to 1987 was to publicize the work of the institute and to act as an intellectual salesman for the Hayekian message it was to propound so effectively for the next thirty years. The IEA needed an editorial director to promote the publication of articles. In February 1957 Harris met Arthur Seldon. It was the perfect match. They both came from working-class roots yet possessed different skills. Seldon was the &#145;embodiment of intellectual rigour: Harris was an enthusiastic spreader of their message&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Seldon</span>, 61). In a reflective piece, &#145;Living with Arthur&#146;, Harris later commented on his close relationship with Seldon:<blockquote>From our first days together in 1957 I recognised and deferred to Arthur's intellectual pre-eminence &hellip; Arthur was a quite exceptional teacher and I positively revelled in my good fortune for 30 years to be his favoured perpetual pupil &hellip; I increasingly found myself looking on Arthur as a second brother with whom it would be inconceivable to fall out very seriously or for very long. (<span class="italic">Harris in his Own Words</span>, 14&#150;16)</blockquote>In the first few years of the IEA Harris and Seldon found it difficult to recruit like-minded writers due to the prevailing Keynesian paradigm with its emphasis on state intervention, so the two of them wrote many of the early publications themselves. Harris publicized the work by sending it to journalists for review and by inviting academics, journalists, and businessmen for lunch. It was through this network that he also later raised money for the continuing work of the institute. (The initial funding had been provided by Fisher, founder of the Buxted Chicken Company.) Seldon described Harris as &#145;a past master at selling, persuading and explaining &hellip; my salesman as it were&#146;  (<span class="italic">Conversation</span>, 36). The IEA distanced itself from any political party, with Harris abandoning his association with the Conservatives. The IEA papers avoided the constraint of what was politically possible and instead focused on winning the intellectual case for free markets and capitalism. In conversation with Fisher Hayek had suggested: &#145;Society's course will be changed only by a change in ideas. First you must reach the intellectuals, the teachers and writers, with reasoned argument. It will be their influence on society which will prevail, and the politicians will follow&#146;  (Blundell, 17).<br>
<br>The IEA's influence on the Conservative Party started after that party's defeat in the general election of 1964. Keith Joseph, later an architect of the &#145;Thatcher revolution&#146;, found in Harris and Seldon's IEA a theoretical underpinning for his own developing intellectual case for economic liberalism. Geoffrey Howe, later Margaret Thatcher's first chancellor, was also an avid reader of IEA publications, particularly on welfare reform. In a letter to Harris in 1977 Thatcher reflected on the contribution of the IEA to her &#145;assault on the post-war consensus&#146;: &#145;At times it must have seemed like bashing your head against a brick wall but political historians will, I believe, judge [the IEA] in proper perspective&#146;  (Cockett, 173). It was Harris who invited Milton Friedman to dine privately with Thatcher in 1978. Friedman's clear monetarist views on tackling inflation clearly helped to shape the Thatcher government's deflationary policies. Days after winning the general election of 1979 Thatcher asked Harris to take a seat in the House of Lords. The invitation came at a time of personal tragedy for Harris and his family as their son Simon had died suddenly at the age of twenty-six after a long battle &#145;with drugs and drink which he had at last shown signs of winning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Harris in his Own Words</span>, 22). On a professional front Harris was worried about the implications for the perceived political neutrality of the IEA if he took up a political position in the Lords. Seldon's suggestion that he take a seat on the crossbenches and thus avoid any accusation of politicking allowed him to be Thatcher's first nominee to enter the upper chamber, taking the title Baron Harris of High Cross (the territorial designation derived from the brick monument in the centre of Tottenham).<br>
<br>Harris had already become involved in a number of political campaigns and societies long before entering the Lords. He helped set up the Constitutional Book Club in 1970 with Rhodes Boyson, a state school headmaster and future Conservative minister, and Ross McWhirter, another aspiring Conservative MP. The club produced a series of pamphlets published by the Churchill Press, the most influential probably being the first, <span class="italic">Right Turn</span> (1970), in which Harris wrote an essay entitled &#145;The morality of capitalism&#146;. He also campaigned against comprehensivization, fighting a legal battle with other parents to prevent his daughter's school changing status. As chairman of the Wincott Foundation, founded in honour of the financial journalist Harold Wincott, from 1969 to 1995, he celebrated good financial journalism through the foundation's annual awards and lectures. As secretary of the Mont Pelerin Society from 1967, and president from 1982 to 1984, he had regular contact with the leading thinkers behind the classical liberal revival, including Milton Friedman, James Buchanan, George Stigler, Ronald Coase, and Gary Becker. Inspired by Friedrich Hayek, the society brought together the economists who were to inspire the IEA's thinking. In particular Buchanan's &#145;public choice theory&#146; provided a theoretical framework for an attack on &#145;big&#146; government in all its guises. The theory attacked the romantic notion that civil servants always act in the public interest and instead suggested that, like those making economic choices in the private sector, their decisions were guided by self-interest. Harris's access to these thinkers, many of them Nobel prizewinners, gave the IEA a willing selection of academic giants to write papers and give lectures.<br>
<br>Harris was forever active in a wide variety of free-market causes. Opened in 1976, following a campaign by Harris, Seldon, and others in 1967&#150;9, and given its royal charter in 1983, the University of Buckingham was Britain's first independent university. Harris served on its council between 1980 and 1995. In 1976 he was appointed honorary secretary of the Political Economy Club, founded in 1821 to support the principles of free trade. During the late 1970s and 1980s several liberal, right-leaning think tanks emerged, the most notable being the Centre for Policy Studies, started by Keith Joseph in 1974, the Social Affairs Unit, founded in 1980 as an offshoot of the IEA, and the Centre for Research into Communist Economies, founded in 1983 by Harris, Fisher, and Ljubo Sirc. Harris was involved in the influential, right-wing No Turning Back group founded after the Conservative election victory of 1983 and committed to continuing Thatcher's free-market reforms. As the first chairman of the Eurosceptic Bruges Group, established in 1989 by Patrick Robertson, Harris warned of the submersion of Thatcher's reforms by a growing EU committed to socialist rather than free-market solutions. He resigned in 1991 after Robertson attacked the Major government for its policy towards Kurdish refugees. Harris held several boardroom roles after his full-time involvement with the IEA finished, most notably as a director of Times Newspapers (1988&#150;2001).<br>
<br>Perhaps Harris's most controversial position was as chairman of Forest, the pro-smoking lobbying group, from 1989 until his death. An avid pipe-smoker, he abhorred the government's restrictions on smokers, and in one of his most infamous publications, <span class="italic">Smoking out the Truth</span> (2005), challenged the chief medical officer to provide the supposed evidence that passive smoking seriously damages health. He wrote: &#145;The imposition of a ban on smoking in so-called public places would &hellip; represent a triumph of prejudice and propaganda masquerading as science&#146;  (<span class="italic">Smoking</span>, 17). Harris also courted controversy in the late 1990s by assisting his long-standing friend Neil Hamilton in raising money to support his libel case against Mohammed Al Fayed. Harris refused to name the backers he had persuaded to contribute to the fund when Hamilton lost and Al Fayed demanded payment of his own legal fees by those backers, on the grounds that they had encouraged Hamilton in his action. Having promised confidentiality to the 400 or so contributors, Harris asserted: &#145;If it was a question of a week in jail for contempt of court then I suppose I'd have to do it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, 22 Dec 1999). In the event the High Court ruled that Hamilton's backers would not have to pay Al Fayed's costs.<br>
<br>With over thirty years at the centre of liberal economic thinking, Harris's contribution to the political landscape of Britain was considerable. From its humble beginnings, the IEA grew to be the leading free-market think tank in Britain and among the most influential worldwide. At its epicentre stood the unshakeable ideological partnership of Harris and Seldon. Although Seldon was the more prolific writer of the two, Harris undoubtedly provided the crucial marketing prowess to get the message across to a decreasingly sceptical audience. In measuring the IEA's contribution to the intellectual battle of ideas Milton Friedman concluded that:<blockquote>As veterans of a major &hellip; intellectual battle dating back to the end of World War II, and in the phalanx of people who have promoted ideas of freedom and human liberty, Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon deserve a place of honour. (<span class="italic">Conversation</span>, 72)</blockquote>Harris was of distinctive, and in later years somewhat old-fashioned, appearance, with a centre parting in thinning hair and toothbrush moustache, a blazer, fancy waistcoat, and deerstalker hat, and a meerschaum pipe hanging from his mouth (with several more bulging from a pocket). He was fond of bathing in the sea and was an accomplished conjuror. He was noted for his quick wit, and his speeches in the House of Lords always projected a consistent message with a persuasive eloquence and disarming humour. He died at Barnet General Hospital on 19 October 2006 of hypovolaemic shock following a ruptured aortic aneurysm, and was survived by his wife, Jos&eacute;, and daughter, Angela, both sons having predeceased him.<br>
