<span class="headword">Dicas <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Arstall]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1800&#150;1815), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was the elder daughter of John Dicas, a Liverpool wine and brandy merchant, who married Alice Edmonton at Holy Trinity Church, Chester, on 9 July 1777. No record of her birth or baptism has been found, although her brother, Robert, was baptized at St Nicholas's, Liverpool, on 29 May 1787. He does not appear to have survived to maturity.<br>
<br>John Dicas, noted in local directories from 1774, invented an improved hydrometer for measuring the specific gravity of alcoholic liquids, particularly useful in his line of business, as those in use all had a number of disadvantages. He also invented a saccharometer (for measuring sugar content of liquids) and a lactometer (for measuring the strength of milk). He patented the hydrometer in 1780, and ten years later it was adopted by the United States government as their standard instrument for assessing import duty. John Dicas had, however, died by 1802 when the board of inquiry of the Royal Society was advertising in local newspapers throughout the United Kingdom, inviting instrument makers to bring forward hydrometers which could be tested for adoption by the customs and excise for taxation purposes. His name had been replaced in the local directories by that of Mary Dicas from 1800: if she was born in the year after her parents' marriage, she would by then have been in her early twenties. She took examples of her father's instruments and travelled to London, where she was among ten makers who explained their use before the board of inquiry. However, her bid was unsuccessful, and the excise adopted the hydrometer devised by Bartholomew Sikes.<br>
<br>By 1807 Mary Dicas was in partnership with George Arstall, a scale-beam maker who had his own business at Temple Court, while the Dicas manufactory was based on the north side of the Old Dock. At some point they married, and four children were baptized at St Peter's Church, Liverpool, between 1810 and 1815. The eldest, Frederick Dicas Arstall, in due course became a scale maker, working in Manchester from 1838, and returning to Liverpool in 1851. With the redevelopment of the Old Dock from about 1812, the manufacture of the Dicas hydrometer moved to Temple Court, from which most of the instruments (which were illegal for taxation purposes in the United Kingdom) were exported to the United States. It is difficult to estimate the numbers of these that were made, but by the time the firm was being run by Mary's sister Ann, from 1818, and subsequently by Ann's husband, Benjamin Gammage, from 1823, the hydrometers, now marked &#145;Gammage late Dicas&#146; bore numbers higher than 5599. The date and circumstances of Mary Arstall's death are unknown.<br>
<br>In the 1806 edition of <span class="italic">Directions for using the patent saccharometer for brewing ale and beer &hellip; invented by the late J. Dicas, and made and sold by his successor, M. Dicas</span>, Mary's involvement was not spelt out, but by the 1814 edition, it was clarified as <i>invented by the late</i> <i>John Dicas</i><i>, and for upwards of sixteen years, made only by his daughter and successor, Mary Arstall, late Mary Dicas, mathematical instrument maker, Liverpool: the only proprietor of the patent, who, for some time previous to the decease of her father, assisted in making the above instruments</i>. A manuscript note, added to one copy of this, states &#145;now made by Ann Dicas, successor to M. Arstall&#146;. Benjamin Gammage appeared in the Liverpool directories as a hydrometer maker until 1851.<br>
