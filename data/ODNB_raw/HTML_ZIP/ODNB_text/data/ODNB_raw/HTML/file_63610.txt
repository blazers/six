<span class="headword">McCarthy,  James Joseph</span>  (1817&#150;1882), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Dublin on 6 January 1817, the son of Charles McCarthy (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1800&#150;1831), who came of a Kerry family. He was educated from 1831 at the Christian Brothers' O'Connell School in Dublin. He was trained in the Royal Dublin Society Schools (1834&#150;7) and the office of William Farrell. He seems to have spent the years 1843&#150;6 in England, absorbing the latest developments in church architecture then being vigorously pursued by Augustus Welby Pugin and the Cambridge Camden Society. By 1846 he was back in Dublin, and a church to his design, which he claimed as the first uncompromisingly true church of the old type erected in the archdiocese of Dublin, was begun at Glendalough, co. Wicklow. A parish church at Kilskyre, co. Meath (begun 1847), and a chapel for All Hallows Missionary College, Dublin (1848), soon followed.<br>
<br>James McCarthy was a talented architect. He took to heart Puginian principles of truth to materials, honesty of construction, and fitness of purpose, and he followed Pugin in believing that medieval styles were the only ones possible for a Christian country, particularly in Ireland, where they would be a revival of the venerable architecture of our Catholic forefathers. He could build a simple country church, giving a strong sense of solidity and permanence, but he was also good at grand buildings in Decorated Gothic that fitted the increasingly triumphalist mood of the Catholic church.<br>
<br>McCarthy's success is attributable not just to his talent as an architect, but to his remarkable gift for publicizing that talent. By the late 1840s notices of his work were appearing in the Irish Catholic press, and, from the 1850s, in <span class="italic">The Builder</span> and the <span class="italic">Building News</span>. He wrote on architecture in <span class="italic">Duffy's Irish Catholic Magazine</span>. His biggest coup, however, was his involvement with the Irish Ecclesiological Society, founded in 1849, which gave him access to a network of senior clergy. The only publication of the society, <span class="italic">Suggestions on the Arrangement and Characteristics of Parish Churches</span> (1851), was written by McCarthy. He sent a copy to Pugin, who told him that he was a man raised up to do great things in Ireland, and offered him the supervision of his Irish work. This came to nothing as Pugin died in 1852, though McCarthy succeeded Pugin as architect at Killarney and Enniscorthy cathedrals, and at Maynooth College, where he designed the infirmary (1862) and chapel (1875).<br>
<br>It was McCarthy's good fortune to be a Catholic architect at a time when increased prosperity after the famine, and tightening-up of church organization following the Synod of Thurles in 1850, gave rise to a boom in church building. His practice was almost exclusively religious. He attracted the attention of Archbishop Paul Cullen, and got several commissions that were virtually in Cullen's gift&#151;the completion of Armagh Cathedral in 1851, and the design of the new Catholic university buildings in Dublin in 1862. By the time of his death McCarthy had eighty or so major commissions to his credit, including two more cathedrals, Monaghan (1861) and Thurles (1865). He had become a member of the architectural establishment, and penetrated institutions not readily accessible to Catholics of humble origin: the Royal Irish Academy (1853) and the Royal Hibernian Academy (1861).<br>
<br>Although J. J. McCarthy's public life is fairly well documented, little is known about his private life. From 1851 he lived at various addresses in Rathmines. He and his wife, Agnes (1819&#150;1885), had four children: twins Charles and Emily (<i>b</i>. 9 Dec 1858), Frances, and Agnes, who became a nun. Their son, Charles J. McCarthy (1858&#150;1947), was city architect of Dublin from 1893 to 1920. J. J. McCarthy died, after a long illness, at his house, Charleston House, Leinster Road, Rathmines, on 6 February 1882 and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. Sometimes known as &#145;the Irish Pugin&#146;, McCarthy's importance lies in the large number of churches he designed, and in the fact that he established ecclesiologically correct Gothic as the style for Catholic church building in Ireland.<br>
