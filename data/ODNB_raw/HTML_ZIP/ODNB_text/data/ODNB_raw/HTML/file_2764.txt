<span class="headword">Bogdani,  Jacob</span>  (1658&#150;1724), <span class="occ">still-life and bird painter</span>, was born on 6 May 1658 in Eperjes, upper Hungary, the son of Lucas Bogdani (<i>fl</i>. 1656&#150;1684), painter, and his wife, Susanna. He was educated at the Fels&#337;magyarorsz&aacute;gi Evang&eacute;likusok Koll&eacute;giuma, Eperjes, and probably became his father's pupil. By 1684 he was in Amsterdam&#151;an obvious refuge at that date for a young protestant with artistic ambitions&#151;and is documented as still being there in the company of the still-life painter Ernst Stuven (1660&#150;1712) in 1686. By the spring of 1688 he had moved to England and was living in Tower Street, St Giles-in-the-Fields, the area of London in which he probably remained for the rest of his life. In 1693 (on or after 29 November) he married Elizabeth Hemmings (<i>d</i>. 1722), and two of their five children survived infancy. According to Vertue, &#145;he was always a mild gentle temper'd man, courteous &amp; civil&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.127). He was at first known only as &#145;the Hungarian&#146; but within a short time had &#145;gain'd great applause &amp; was much employd by people of Quality, in whose possessions are many of his peices [<i>sic</i>] to be seen&#146;  (ibid.). One of his early commissions was a set of flower pieces for Queen Mary's &#145;Looking Glasse Closett in the Thames Gallery&#146; at Hampton Court (1694), and he also supplied paintings for William III's palace at Dieren in the Netherlands (1700). Other patrons included the first duke of Devonshire, Edward Harley, the second earl of Oxford, Matthew Prior, Sir Robert Walpole, the first earl of Albemarle, and Queen Anne &#145;who was pleas'd with his performances &amp; encourag'd him much&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Both contemporary comment and pictorial evidence indicate that initially Bogdani painted mainly flower and fruit still-lifes in the Dutch manner and that the bird paintings for which he is probably better known today were a later addition to his <i>&#339;uvre</i>. Clearly influenced by Melchior de Hondecoeter (1636&#150;1695) though lacking his more ferocious elements, Bogdani's exotic and English birds, poultry, game, and occasionally small animals, somewhat improbably grouped in park or landscape settings, are more civilized and restful. They are also meticulously and accurately represented, and richly colourful and decorative&#151;qualities greatly valued by his aristocratic patrons. Some of Bogdani's earliest bird paintings, a unique record of the rare birds in the famous Windsor aviary of the duke of Marlborough's brother Admiral George Churchill, were acquired by Queen Anne after the admiral's death.<br>
<br>Bogdani's surviving works, all oil paintings on canvas, are never dated but usually signed &#145;J. Bogdani&#146;. Occasionally, probably prior to his naturalization in 1700, he signed &#145;J. v Bogdane&#146; or added the inscription &#145;Hungarus&#146;. His prolific output and exact repetitions of his more successful images suggest a reliance on sketches and the use of assistants. His son William Bogdani (1699&#150;1771), a distinguished civil servant who &#145;formerly painted in his father's manner&#146;  (Walpole, 143), and his son-in-law, the Transylvanian painter Tobias Stranover (1684&#150;1756), are thought to have been his pupils. They inherited his &#145;Modells&#146; (probably sketches) and Stranover often adopted motifs from Bogdani's paintings. Many public and private collections contain examples of his work, including the Royal Collection; Chatsworth House, Derbyshire; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut; and the National Gallery of Hungary, Budapest. By the end of his life Bogdani &#145;had gain'd by his industry a pretty fortune&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.127) and owned property in Finchley, Spalding, and Hitchin where he was lord of the manor, a position also enjoyed by his son and grandson. He died &#145;at his house, the sign of the Golden Eagle, in Great Queen Street&#146;, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London  (Walpole, 3.143), and was buried on 11 February 1724 at St Mary's, Finchley, Middlesex. After his death his work was largely forgotten until Hungarian interest <i>c</i>.1900 aroused international attention that continued to increase throughout the twentieth century.<br>
