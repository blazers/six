<span class="headword">Terrick,  Richard</span>  (1710&#150;1777), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born probably at York and was baptized in York Minster on 20 July of that year. He was the eldest son of Samuel Terrick (<i>d</i>. 1719), prebendary of York, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibson (<i>d</i>. 1764), widow of Nathaniel Arlush of Kedlington, Yorkshire. Although his early schooling is apparently unrecorded he matriculated as pensioner at Clare College, Cambridge, on 30 May 1726; he graduated BA in 1729 and MA in 1733. He was a fellow of the college from 1731 to 1738; the latter year, in which he resigned his fellowship, was probably the date of his marriage to Tabitha (1712/13&#150;1790), daughter of William Stainforth, rector of Simonburn, Northumberland. Terrick was ordained deacon in the diocese of Ely on 24 December 1732 and priest two years later. Of a clerical family, it is probable that he was from an early age destined for a career in the church; his younger brother Samuel (<i>d</i>. 1761) followed him to Cambridge and was subsequently a prebendary of Durham.<br>
<br>Terrick quickly acquired valuable connections. He was preacher at the Rolls Chapel from 1736 to 1757, and from 1739 to 1742 he served as chaplain to the speaker of the House of Commons, Arthur Onslow. He was a canon of Windsor from 1742 to 1749 and chaplain to George II from 1745 to 1757. He became vicar of Twickenham on 30 June 1749 and on 7 October of the same year he was installed as prebendary of Ealdland and canon-residentiary at St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Partly through the influence of William Cavendish, fourth duke of Devonshire, but more particularly due to the personal decision of George II, Terrick was nominated to the bishopric of Peterborough on 7 June 1757 and consecrated at Lambeth on 3 July. At this point he relinquished his preferments, with the exception of Twickenham. One of his first acts as bishop was to issue a letter to his clergy urging a more devout observance of Good Friday. According to Horace Walpole, who despised Terrick as a time-server and on one occasion reportedly insulted him by addressing him, after his elevation to the bench, as plain &#145;Mr Terrick&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>), Terrick deserted the duke of Devonshire and transferred his allegiance to John Stuart, third earl of Bute, in expectation of preferment on the accession of Bute's affectionate pupil the future George III. If so he was not disappointed. The death of Richard Osbaldeston on 13 May 1764 created a vacancy for the see of London. The prime minister, George Grenville, was solicited for the vacancy by William Warburton, bishop of Gloucester, and Thomas Newton, bishop of Bristol. However, as Grenville tactfully explained to Warburton, George III had intended that Terrick should succeed Osbaldeston ever since the latter's appointment in 1762  (Smith, 2.314). On his translation Terrick informed Grenville that he had increased the income of Peterborough from 1000 guineas to &#145;eleven hundred pounds clear&#146;  (ibid., 2.313). He was confirmed as bishop on 6 June 1764 and resigned the vicarage of Twickenham, which he estimated as &#145;&pound;200, clear about &pound;140&#146;  (ibid.). On 11 July 1764 he was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>There was never any doubt but that Terrick would be a loyal ministerial adherent in the House of Lords. In February 1764 he pledged his support to the ministry of George Grenville  (Tomlinson, 88&#150;9). As bishop of London his pastoral responsibilities included the North American colonies, and he strongly supported the work of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in those areas; he preached the annual sermon before the society in 1764. He gave general support to the policy of taxing the American colonies and, ultimately, of using force to suppress the rebellion. Terrick was not one of the opponents of the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in 1766 and he seems to have shared the view of several of his fellow bishops that repeal, by allaying colonial discontent, would render more acceptable the long-standing Anglican aspiration to establish a resident bishop in the colonies. He was listed as a supporter of North's administration in 1774 and 1775 (Debrett, 7.17; <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, 7 Oct 1775).<br>
<br>He shared much of the anti-Catholicism of his time, forbidding the intrusion of mural paintings into St Paul's Cathedral on the grounds that such a practice was &#145;Popish&#146;  (Sykes, 236) and instituting diocesan inquiries into the alleged growth of Catholic numbers. In 1765 Horace Walpole noted, &#145;I see by the papers that the Bishop of London is suppressing Mass-houses&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 30.209). However, he did not oppose the <span class="roman">Quebec Act</span>, which granted limited toleration and legal rights to Francophone Catholics in Canada, in 1774. By contrast he spoke and voted in the House of Lords against the <span class="roman">Dissenters Relief Bill</span> on 19 May 1772 and appears to have colluded with several dissenting critics of the bill to help to secure its rejection in the upper house  (Ditchfield, 54, 76). He devoted considerable time and money to the refurbishment of the chapel of Fulham Palace and was a generous benefactor of Clare College, Cambridge. Though never a distinguished scholar he published six separate sermons and acquired a reputation as a conscientious, if not a particularly inspiring, diocesan. There is also evidence that he was a more than competent preacher; Alexander Carlyle, for instance, heaped praise upon his preaching and his reading of prayers. It was probably for these reasons that he remained on close terms with George III, who, according to Walpole, consulted him about the surreptitious marriages of the dukes of Cumberland and Gloucester  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 23.483). On the death of Archbishop Drummond of York in 1776 the king offered the vacancy to Terrick, who declined it on grounds of age and ill health.<br>
<br>Terrick died at Fulham Palace on 31 March 1777 and was buried on 8 April in All Saints' churchyard, Fulham. The monument to him in that church was probably more accurate than many eulogies to the dead when it singled out his &#145;great experience and sound judgment, his candour, moderation and benevolence&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.584). There was nothing in the exercise of his benevolence that challenged either Anglican doctrinal orthodoxy or Anglican hegemony in the state. It is a measure of the success of his career that his daughter Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1804) married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24401/', "Nathaniel Ryder")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24394/', "Ryder, Sir Dudley")</script>], who became the first Baron Harrowby, and that his widow was reported to have bequeathed a fortune of &pound;30,000 on her death in 1790  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 60/1, 1790, 186).<br>
