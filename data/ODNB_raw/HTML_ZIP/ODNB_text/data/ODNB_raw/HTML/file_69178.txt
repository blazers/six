<span class="headword">French,  Harold Arthur George</span>  (1900&#150;1997), <span class="occ">actor and director</span>, was born on 23 April 1900 at 6 Herne Hill Road, Brixton, the son of Irish parents, William Joseph French, a journeyman optician, and his wife, Gertrude Lucy Brady. He was educated at Edge Hill College, Wimbledon. After answering an Italia Conti advertisement he was soon promoted from understudy to d&eacute;but as Mamillius in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> (1912) at London's Savoy Theatre, followed by a role in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> as a black page. He appeared with No&euml;l Coward and Gertrude Lawrence at the Liverpool Playhouse and with Lewis Casson and Sybil Thorndike at the Gaiety, Manchester, before a Christmas revival of <span class="italic">Where the Rainbow Ends</span> (1913) as Crispian Gray, which he reprised for the next two years. Numerous minor roles followed, including nine months with the Birmingham repertory, before he was called up in 1917, joining the Royal Flying Corps.<br>
<br>After demobilization French was soon back on the stage, as both Athos and the Baron de Casterae in <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span> (1919) at the Garrick. Throughout the 1920s he was a familiar face, mostly in London but occasionally on tour, appearing chiefly in inconsequential light or musical comedy such as <span class="italic">The Blue Lagoon</span> (1920) at the Prince of Wales, <span class="italic">The Bird of Paradise</span> (1922) at the Garrick, and <span class="italic">Good Gracious, Annabelle!</span> (1923) at the Duke of York's. He toured in <span class="italic">By-the-Way</span> (1924) before appearing in it also at the Apollo and then in New York. And he appeared again with Gertrude Lawrence&#151;a favourite co-star in such fare&#151;as Jimmy Winter, in the Gershwins' <span class="italic">Oh, Kay!</span> (1927) at His Majesty's. On 3 February 1927 he married Phyllis Marie Symondson (1901/2&#150;1941), who acted under the name Phyl Arnold. They had a daughter, who was killed on her first flight as an air hostess. There were more light leading roles into the 1930s, including <span class="italic">The Gay Princess</span> and <span class="italic">Marriage &agrave; la mode</span> (both 1931), <span class="italic">Whose Baby are You</span> and <span class="italic">Night of the Garter</span> (both 1932), and finally <span class="italic">Among Friends</span> (1933) for the Overture Players at the Piccadilly. Having made his film d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Land of Mystery</span> (1920), by the 1930s he was appearing as an equally lightweight lead actor on screen, although perhaps only <span class="italic">Night of the Garter</span> (1933), a reprise of his stage role, <span class="italic">How's Chances?</span> (1934), directed by Anthony Kimmins, and <span class="italic">The Girl in the Crowd</span> (1935), directed by Michael Powell, are really worth remembering.<br>
<br>By now it was &#145;abundantly clear to him that neither his talents nor his inclinations fitted him for performing on the stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Oct 1997) and French switched to directing for the stage, commencing with <span class="italic">Youth at the Helm</span> (1934). His first major success was <span class="italic">French without Tears</span> (1936) at the Criterion. For some time its preparation and rehearsal seemed destined to fail but, coming together so well on opening night, it was a triumph, not least for its young author, Terence Rattigan. There was a greater certainty to French in front of the stage, and he directed another ten plays in the next five years, including <span class="italic">Ladies and Gentlemen</span> (1937), Coward's <span class="italic">Design for Living</span> (1939), and S. N. Behrman's <span class="italic">No Time for Comedy</span> (1941). This latter title was sadly apt: his wife Phyllis was killed during the blitz in that year.<br>
<br>French also gave up film acting, turning firstly to co-scriptwriting&#151;<span class="italic">Accused</span> and <span class="italic">Crime over London</span> (both 1936), <span class="italic">Jump for Glory</span> (1937)&#151;and then to directing, making a good d&eacute;but with <span class="italic">The Cavalier of the Streets</span> (1937). His films were very English and, while making no masterpiece, he maintained a high standard of &#145;pleasing, unassuming, skilful entertainment&#146;  (Quinlan), partly thanks to his using the talents of such scriptwriters as Anatole de Grunwald, Terence Rattigan, and Roland Pertwee. Uncredited (as was David Lean), he co-directed <span class="italic">Major Barbara</span> (1941) for its named director, Gabriel Pascal. Particular successes after this included the romantic comedy <span class="italic">Jeannie</span> (1941), the excellent spy drama <span class="italic">The Day will Dawn</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Mr Emmanuel</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">White Cradle Inn</span> (1947). The last was good but a box-office flop, but a big commercial success was the well-crafted <span class="italic">My Brother Jonathan</span> (1947). Also successful were &#145;several warm and cosily amusing portraits of middle-class British family life&#146;  (ibid.): <span class="italic">Dear Octopus</span> (1943), <span class="italic">English without Tears</span> (1944), <span class="italic">Quiet Weekend</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">Isn't Life Wonderful!</span> (1952). He directed segments of three portmanteau films based on stories by Somerset Maugham, <span class="italic">Quartet</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Trio</span> (1950), and <span class="italic">Encore</span> (1952), and was the unlikely director of <span class="italic">Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue</span> (1953), a rather wooden version of the Scottish story for Disney. Although some television work followed into the 1960s, his last film was <span class="italic">The Man who Loved Redheads</span> (1955), a final screen collaboration with Rattigan, who said of him, &#145;he had the kind of manners that are so good they are never noticed, intense liveliness of disposition, and as keen a sense of humour as I have ever encountered&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Jan 1998).<br>
<br>French now returned to the stage, commencing with the melodrama <span class="italic">Tabitha</span> (1956); at this time he directed Australian actress Mary Parker (<i>d</i>. 1993) who later became his second wife. Among his later plays were <span class="italic">Waltz of the Toreadors</span> (1958) from Anouilh's French original, <span class="italic">When in Rome</span> (1959), <span class="italic">The More the Merrier</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">A Public Mischief</span> (1965). As late as 1971 French was touring in South Africa with <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> and <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, himself playing Shylock in the latter. In later life he wrote two well-received volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">I Swore I Never Would</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">I Thought I Never Could</span> (1973). As a younger man he had enjoyed golf, swimming, and punting. French died on 19 October 1997 at Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham.<br>
