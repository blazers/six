<span class="headword">Agnew family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1817&#150;1986), <span class="occ">art dealers</span>, maintained the firm established by <a name="cosubject_71776"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [i] Agnew</span>  (1794&#150;1871)<span class="occ"></span> in Market Street, Manchester, in 1817. Thomas Agnew was born in Liverpool on 16 December 1794, the posthumous son of John Agnew of Culhorn, Wigtownshire, and his wife, Jane Glover. His father was descended from the Sheuchan branch of the Agnew of Lochnaw family. After studying drawing and modelling in Liverpool, Thomas Agnew moved to Manchester, where he was apprenticed in 1810 to Vittore Zanetti, an Italian printseller and dealer in clocks and optical instruments. He became Zanetti's partner in September 1817; Zanetti retired in 1828, and Thomas became sole proprietor in 1835. Under his direction, Zanetti and Agnew increasingly dealt in works of art, print publishing, and picture frame carving and gilding.<br>
<br>On 19 February 1823 Thomas Agnew married Jane Garnet Lockett (<i>d</i>. 1864), daughter and coheir of William Lockett (<i>d</i>. 1856), a wealthy businessman and first mayor of Salford. Their son <a name="cosubject_30348"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Agnew</span>, first baronet  (1825&#150;1910)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 20 October 1825 in Salford, established Agnews as a leading international firm. A second son, Thomas [ii], born in 1827, was followed by two more sons and four daughters. The elder Thomas, an ardent Swedenborgian, sent his sons William and Thomas to the Revd J. H. Smithson's Swedenborgian school in Salford; adhering to their father's faith, with its emphasis on good works, they absorbed its mixture of scientific, pantheistic, and theosophic doctrines.<br>
<br>After an apprenticeship to his father in 1840, William and his brother Thomas became his partners in 1850; the firm traded as Thos. Agnew &amp; Sons from Exchange Street from 1826 until the Manchester branch closed in 1932, when it became a limited company. Surviving records show that stock was valued at &pound;27,000 in 1851, of which &pound;5700 was in pictures, &pound;700 in watercolours, with &pound;16,000 owed the firm; this compares with &pound;7000 of stock held in 1824. The firm traded chiefly in British contemporary artists such as Daniel Maclise, J. R. Herbert, and Clarkson Stanfield; J. M. W. Turner's <span class="italic">View from Barnes Terrace</span> (National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC) was listed at &pound;252, and was the first of many Turners to pass through Agnews; works by William Etty, T. S. Cooper, Sir Edwin Landseer, J. B. Pyne, and William Westall also feature. Agnews catered primarily for the newly wealthy self-made northern and midland industrialists such as Joseph Gillott, T. Horrocks Miller, Sir William Armstrong, George Holt, and John Graham of Glasgow.<br>
<br>A London branch was opened at 5 Waterloo Place in 1860. Stock held in June 1861 totalled &pound;61,000, comprising &pound;14,000 in pictures, &pound;6300 in watercolours, with engravings and money owed making up the balance. Agnews began bidding at Christies on a considerable scale; in one month (May 1861), for example, they spent &pound;2400 at the auction room. Thomas [ii] may have initiated the London move, but he lacked his elder brother's wider interests, preferring to concentrate on money-making, and left over &pound;500,000 on his death in 1883, much of it made outside picture dealing. In 1875 the firm moved to 39 (now 43) Old Bond Street, formerly an old coaching yard, where it built its present spacious galleries.<br>
<br>After the elder Thomas's retirement in 1861 (he died on 24 March 1871 at his home, Fairhope, Eccles Old Road, Pendleton, Salford), William Agnew became the guiding force of the firm. Sir Geoffrey Agnew described his great-grandfather's exuberant vitality, immense ambition, strong will, occasional ruthlessness, and highest probity. An imposing man, William Agnew was a born actor (he always bid at auction in a top hat) and a most persuasive salesman; he was decisive and often bought ahead of the taste of his day. His business acumen was tempered by a personal charm and simplicity that endeared him to many, including the artists, musicians, politicians, and clients whom he frequently entertained either at Summer Hill, Salford, or at Great Stanhope Street, London.<br>
<br>Among William Agnew's coups was the purchase in 1884 from the Leigh Court sale of Hogarth's <span class="italic">Shrimp Girl</span> and <span class="italic">Miss Fenton</span> for the National Gallery. Earlier, on 6 May 1876, he had bought from the Wynn Ellis sale Gainsborough's <span class="italic">Duchess of Devonshire</span> (1783) for &pound;10,505. Stolen later that month, it was not recovered until March 1901, when it was purchased by J. Pierpont Morgan. Holman Hunt benefited from William's purchase in 1873 of <span class="italic">The Shadow of Death</span> for &pound;10,500, including the engraving rights (which recouped much of the initial outlay from sales of the engraving); in 1883 Agnew presented it to Manchester City Art Gallery. He discovered the young Fred Walker in 1864, and presented <span class="italic">The Harbour of Refuge</span> (1872) to the Tate Gallery in 1893, in memory of his wife, Mary Kenworthy, whom he had married on 25 March 1851; she died on 2 September 1892. John Millais, Frederic Leighton, and Edward Burne-Jones he treated in an avuncular style, and he encouraged his client Henry Tate to found the Tate Gallery.<br>
<br>William and Mary Agnew had four sons and two daughters. Their eldest son, George William (1852&#150;1941), and their second son, <a name="cosubject_71778"></a><span class="headword">(Charles) Morland Agnew</span>  (1855&#150;1931)<span class="occ"></span>, born in Salford on 14 December 1855, joined the firm in 1874 and 1878 respectively; a nephew, <a name="cosubject_71777"></a><span class="headword">(William) Lockett Agnew</span>  (1858&#150;1918)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Thomas [ii] and his wife, Anne Kenworthy, born on 20 April 1858 at Hope, Eccles Road, Pendleton, Salford, joined in 1881. Between 1880 and his retirement in 1895 William formed two great collections: those of Sir Charles Tennant and Sir Edward Guinness (later first earl of Iveagh). The most famous of the Tennant pictures, Constable's <span class="italic">The Opening of Waterloo Bridge</span> (1832), bought from Agnew in 1891, entered the Tate Gallery in 1987. Lord Iveagh began collecting in June 1887, and by April 1891 had bought from Agnews some 223 pictures and drawings. Sixty-two of the choice collection he left to the nation with his beautiful Adam house at Kenwood had come from Agnews.<br>
<br>In 1870 William Agnew and his two brothers Thomas [ii] and John Henry joined their brother-in-law William Bradbury (who had married William's sister Laura) in the London printing firm of Bradbury and Evans (the proprietors of <span class="italic">Punch</span>), now renamed Bradbury and Agnew. William Agnew became chairman in 1890 and took a keen interest in <span class="italic">Punch</span> and its illustrators.<br>
<br>A staunch Liberal and close friend of Gladstone, William Agnew became MP for South-East Lancashire in 1880&#150;85, and for the Stretford division of Lancashire in 1885&#150;6. In 1885 he spoke in the House of Commons in support of the purchase for the nation at &pound;83,250 of Raphael's <span class="italic">Ansidei Madonna</span> and Van Dyck's portrait of Charles I from the duke of Marlborough's collection. He supported Gladstone's <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> in the spring of 1886 and was defeated at the general election held that summer. He unsuccessfully contested the Prestwich division in 1892. Deeply involved in philanthropic enterprises, especially in Manchester, he was also a music patron. On Lord Rosebery's recommendation he was created a baronet on 2 September 1895; he died at his London home, 11 Great Stanhope Street, Mayfair, on 31 October 1910, and his body was cremated at Golders Green. His son George William succeeded him in the baronetcy; he became Liberal MP for Salford, and was an expert on eighteenth-century English mezzotints.<br>
<br>Morland and Lockett Agnew, assisted by Sir George's second son, (George) Colin Agnew (1882&#150;1975), who, after Sir George's retirement in 1902, joined in 1906, continued the business successfully until the outbreak of war in 1914. Morland (who retired in 1913) and Colin were connoisseurs, Lockett, who was highly sociable, the superb salesman. Agnews had become internationally known, and many of the leading American collectors were among its clients. Morland's son (Charles) Gerald (1882&#150;1954) joined in 1904, and was put in charge of the Manchester branch until 1914. In addition to a Paris branch, Colin opened a branch in Berlin in 1908. A New York branch, opened in 1925, was closed in 1932. One of Morland's coups was the purchase in 1905 of Vel&aacute;zquez's &#145;Rokeby Venus&#146; (its beauty hidden under grime), which he sold for &pound;45,000 to the National Gallery. Hugh Ladas (Tim) Agnew (1894&#150;1975), Gerald's younger brother, who joined in 1920, reorganized the finances and administration of the firm. Lockett died at his home, 10 Chesterfield Street, Mayfair, on 15 February 1918; Morland died on 23 May 1931 at his home, Durrants, Croxley Green, Rickmansworth.<br>
<br>The 1920s boom years were followed by the severe slump of the early 1930s, and in October 1931 <a name="cosubject_56384"></a><span class="headword">Sir Geoffrey William Gerald Agnew</span>  (1908&#150;1986)<span class="occ"></span> became first a salesman, then a partner, at a most unpropitious time. Geoffrey, born on 11 July 1908 at Knutsford, Cheshire, was the elder son of Gerald Agnew (1882&#150;1954) and his wife, Olive Mary (<i>d</i>. 1946), daughter of William Danks, a canon of Canterbury. Educated at Eton College, where he was an oppidan scholar in 1923, he read history at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1930. As a fifth generation member of Agnews, he was proud of the family tradition; on 25 April 1934 he married art historian the Hon. Doreen Maud (1908/9&#150;1990), younger daughter of Herbert Merton Jessel, first Baron Jessel; they had two sons and a daughter, and the younger son, Julian (<i>b</i>. 1943), eventually succeeded his father as chairman. In his <span class="italic">Agnew's, 1817&#150;1967</span> (1967) Sir Geoffrey recalled the difficulties of selling even the top-quality pictures; Agnews was overstocked, and only staved off bankruptcy by making several important, highly profitable, private sales in the late 1930s. He became managing director in 1937, and revived the practice of exhibiting works by contemporary British artists, although keeping more to the safely established and orthodox rather than the avant-garde.<br>
<br>Unfit for military service during the Second World War, Geoffrey Agnew returned to Eton as a memorable history master and officer training corps company commander. A man of great energy, and bluff, commanding presence, his booming voice and showmanship masked an innate taste and sensibility, which, combined with wide knowledge, a formidable memory, and great perseverance, made him a dynamic leader and masterly negotiator. Returning to Agnews, he was chairman from 1965 to 1982, and quickly re-established its international pre-eminence, winning the confidence equally of museum directors and wealthy collectors, some of whom, like his best client, Paul Mellon, became personal friends. He sold Mellon in 1966 Turner's <span class="italic">Dort or Dordrecht: the Dort Packet-Boat from Rotterdam Becalmed (1818)</span>, one of the finest earlier works still privately owned. Turner was an artist of whom he spoke with great warmth and understanding. He became founder chairman of the Friends of the Courtauld Institute in 1970, chairman of the Society of London Art Dealers in 1970&#150;74, an adviser to the trustees of Chequers, and was involved in many charities. Knighted in 1973, he died at his home, Flat 3, 6 Onslow Square, London, on 22 November 1986, and his body was cremated at Putney. The firm still flourishes and remains an essentially family concern: it has played a major role in the English art world for nearly two centuries.<br>
