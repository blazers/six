<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Petty <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Fitzmaurice]</span>,  William</span>, second earl of Shelburne and first marquess of Lansdowne  (1737&#150;1805), <span class="occ">prime minister</span>, was born on 2 May 1737 in Dublin, the elder son of John Fitzmaurice 
    (later Petty; 1706&#150;1761)
  , a landowner, and his wife, Mary Fitzmaurice (<i>d</i>. 1780), who was a cousin. His father's family had dominated co. Kerry for generations; his paternal grandmother, Anne, was the daughter of Sir William Petty, whose estates at High Wycombe, carrying with them electoral influence over one seat, were inherited in 1751 by his father, who thereupon changed his name to Petty. His father was created earl of Shelburne in 1753 and in 1760 was raised to the British peerage, an honour which the duke of Newcastle believed was obtained only by his wealth and Henry Fox's patronage.<br>
<br>William, who was styled Viscount Fitzmaurice from 1753, believed his childhood had been peculiarly wretched and talked of it with horror, according to his friend Jeremy Bentham. Brought up in co. Kerry by his grandfather, the first earl of Kerry, whom he thought a tyrant by nature, he described his experience of childhood as &#145;domestic brutality and ill-usage&#146;, since his father had &#145;no notion of governing his children except by fear&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.9, 12). He was educated at Dr Ford's school in Dublin and was instructed by a private tutor before going to Christ Church, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 11 March 1755. He summarized his position on leaving Christ Church: &#145;it became necessary for me to take some resolution for myself; home detestable, no prospect of a decent allowance to go abroad, neither happiness nor quiet&#146;  (ibid., 1.92). Having joined the army, he served in the 20th regiment and was present at the attack upon Rochefort in 1757. He was then appointed to Lord Granby's staff in Germany and distinguished himself at Minden (1759) and Kloster Kampen (1760). His reward was immediate. By the end of 1760 he had been promoted colonel and appointed aide-de-camp to the new king, George III. His prospects were transformed. In June 1760, after his father had been given a British barony, Fitzmaurice succeeded to the parliamentary seat at Wycombe, and at the general election of 1761 he was returned to the Westminster parliament for Wycombe and to the Dublin parliament for County Kerry.<br>
<br>This spectacular progress aroused envy. The duke of Richmond resigned his place in the royal bedchamber in protest at the slight which Fitzmaurice's army promotions implied for his brother, Lord George Lennox. Before Fitzmaurice could take his seat in either House of Commons, his father's death in May 1761 transported him to the House of Lords at Westminster as Baron Wycombe and at Dublin as second earl of Shelburne. His initial political contacts were with Henry Fox, a distant relative and his father's patron, and with Fox's new ally Lord Bute. Despite his promising military d&eacute;but, Shelburne now resolved on a political career, though he continued to hold army rank. As early as March 1761 he had applied to the king for the comptrollership of the household, in what must have been a maladroit letter: the king, disliking the suggestion that his aide-de-camp sought &#145;real business&#146;, took offence, leaving Shelburne to make awkward apologies through Bute. Next he acted as broker in the complex negotiations by which Bute obtained Fox's support. His credit with the king was further damaged by an injudicious speech and protest on 5 February 1762, when he joined the duke of Bedford in deploring any continuation of the war in Germany (a move against Newcastle) and voted against the previous motion which Bute himself had moved. Bute was irritated, and the king pointedly ignored Shelburne at the next lev&eacute;e. By June 1762 George III was describing Shelburne as a man who &#145;once dissatisfied will go any lengths&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Lord Bute</span>, no. 163).<br>
<br>Shelburne declined to take part in Bute's ministry, despite Fox's urgent entreaty to &#145;get your harness on immediately&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.143). He remained on good terms with Bute and Fox, and in December 1762 moved the acceptance of the peace preliminaries in the Lords. But when in the reshuffle in the spring of 1763, following Bute's decision to retire, Fox proposed Shelburne as one of the two secretaries of state, the king objected strongly. George Grenville, who finished up in the reshuffle as prime minister, warned Bute that Shelburne's promotion would disgust many people: &#145;from Lord Shelburne's youth, his inexperience in business, by having never held any civil office whatever, and from his situation and family, so lately raised to the peerage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 2.35). The problem was compounded by an acrimonious quarrel with his patron Fox, who accused him, without any authority from Fox himself, of spreading the impression that Fox wished to retire from the paymastership. The mutual recriminations in which the affair ended deprived Fox of two of his closest supporters, John Calcraft and Richard Rigby, who sided with Shelburne. It is not easy to see what Shelburne stood to gain by misrepresenting Fox's views, but the episode lost nothing in the retelling, and enhanced Shelburne's growing reputation as a slippery fellow.<h2>
<a name="Cabinetoffice"></a>Cabinet office</h2>Shelburne was also extremely ambitious. Before he had held any political office, and while negotiations were still continuing, his friends spoke of his prospects in lofty terms. On 15 March 1763 Calcraft wrote assuming that Shelburne would be made secretary and dismissing the question of prime minister somewhat airily: &#145;with our hold on Lord Northumberland, is it possible to think of placing him as a great lord &hellip; at the head of the Treasury, either for some short time, or till you could take it?&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.195&#150;6). In the end, Shelburne had to be content to be first lord at the Board of Trade, with a seat in the cabinet, and proved at once a difficult colleague. A demarcation dispute over American policy arose immediately with Lord Egremont, secretary of state for the south, and Shelburne demanded equal access to the king; American issues, brought to the forefront of politics by the Seven Years' War, dominated Shelburne's public life for the next twenty years. For good measure, he was also at odds with the other secretary, Lord Halifax, doubting both the wisdom and the legality of prosecuting Wilkes for no. 45 of the <span class="italic">North Briton</span> under a general warrant. Within two months of taking office Shelburne was threatening resignation. But Bute dissuaded him, pointing out that, at his age, the office which he held was one with which &#145;ambition ought to be satisfied&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.276).<br>
<br>By the summer of 1763 the king was finding Grenville intolerable, and Shelburne was employed to negotiate with Pitt and Bedford. His admiration for Pitt dates from this period. When the negotiations broke down Shelburne tendered his resignation from the Board of Trade, though assuring the king of his continued support. George III regarded it as desertion in the midst of battle: he reported to Grenville, not one of Shelburne's admirers, that &#145;he finds the business of the board disagreeable to him &hellip; and subjecting him to too close an attendance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 2.203). This may have been unfair to Shelburne, but he had held office for only four months: great noblemen with large incomes and estates to supervise often found the routine of administration tedious, and Shelburne had already declared that &#145;emolument&#146; was no consideration with him  (Fitzmaurice, 1.142). On 29 November 1763, in a debate on the expulsion of Wilkes, he spoke strongly against the government line that privilege of parliament did not extend to seditious libel. Grenville, temporarily reconciled with George III, reminded him that Shelburne was still an aide-de-camp and should be disciplined. &#145;A worthless man&#146; was the king's terse reply, and Shelburne was dismissed, together with his parliamentary lieutenants Isaac Barr&eacute; and Calcraft  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 2.230, 236). Horace Walpole presumed that Shelburne was making up to Pitt as the man of the future. It was not, however, at all obvious in 1763 that Pitt had much political future, unless a new war should break out, which might sweep him to power by popular demand. Shelburne prided himself on his independence from party connection and his devotion to the monarch (which does not seem to have been reciprocated). He was now able to devote himself to that rural retirement he had previously commended: he employed Capability Brown to construct the lake at Bowood and Robert Adam to enlarge the house, and he turned his attention to the neglected Wycombe estates. In April 1764 he visited Ireland and took his seat in the Dublin House of Lords. On 2 or 3 February 1765 his marriage to Sophia Carteret (1745&#150;1771), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4804/', "John Carteret, Earl Granville (1690&#150;1763)")</script>, and his second wife, Lady Sophia Fermor, brought him large estates near Bath, including much of Lansdowne Hill. They had two sons, John Henry, who succeeded as second marquess of Lansdowne, and William Granville, who died on 28 January 1778.<h2>
<a name="Pittsdisciple"></a>Pitt's disciple</h2>For a time it looked as though Shelburne's rapprochement with Pitt had been unwise. When the king's patience with Grenville finally ran out in the summer of 1765 it was the marquess of Rockingham who formed a ministry. Shelburne was offered his former post at the Board of Trade, but declined, pleading to Rockingham &#145;a real consciousness of my own inability in so active an office, to which the domestic habits I have lately fallen into add not a little&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.334). His reliance was now totally upon Pitt: &#145;'tis you, Sir, alone, in everybody's opinion&#146;, he wrote to the great man in December 1765, &#145;can put an end to this anarchy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 2.357).<br>
<br>Shelburne followed Pitt's line on America: he spoke and voted on 3 February 1766 for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> but, disapproving strongly of the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> which accompanied it, he warned the Lords that it was unwise to raise abstract constitutional questions, and voted in a minority of 5 to 125 against it. When Pitt, by then elevated to the Lords as earl of Chatham, formed his second ministry in July 1766 in succession to Rockingham, Shelburne was appointed secretary of state for the south. His responsibilities included India, Ireland, and America, as well as diplomatic relations with France, Spain, and the south of Europe. Three factors enhanced his standing still more. His colleague in the northern department was Henry Seymour Conway, one of the more conciliatory politicians of the day; Grafton, officially first lord of the Treasury, was young, inexperienced, and in thrall to Pitt: moreover, Pitt himself succumbed to a mysterious breakdown, which rendered him incapable of business or even human contact, and left Shelburne as his main representative in the deserted cabinet.<br>
<br>The absence of its real head made for an acrimonious and inept administration. Shelburne was soon at odds with a number of his colleagues. His sharpest differences were with Charles Townshend, chancellor of the exchequer, who made all the running in Chatham's absence. Shelburne's attitude towards the American colonies was circumspect, and he hoped that the issue of taxation could be avoided by reducing expenditure and by exploiting the quitrents on virgin land. Townshend, who was not fond of the Americans, approved of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, and in January 1767 he pledged himself to raise an adequate revenue from the colonies. Shelburne appealed by letter to Chatham, recuperating at Bath, but his reply was painfully inexplicit. Townshend's position was strengthened by Lord North's refusal to replace him, and he carried the day; the Townshend duties were introduced in June. Shelburne's ineffective retort was to stop attending cabinet meetings.<br>
<br>The post-war financial difficulties would also be helped if a revenue could be raised from India. The role of the East India Company moved to the forefront and, again, Shelburne and Townshend clashed. Shelburne was deeply interested in the matter, publicly and privately, since he had invested heavily in company stock, which fluctuated according to government intentions, and was supporting Laurence Sulivan in the company against Lord Clive. Chatham and Shelburne denied the right of the company to a territorial revenue and favoured instead a searching review which would lead to a measure of government control and a substantial subsidy to the exchequer: Townshend hoped to achieve a similar end through negotiation with the directors. While matters drifted, Townshend's proposals went through.<br>
<br>Though Shelburne's rivalry with Charles Townshend was ended by the latter's sudden death in September 1767, it continued with his elder brother, Lord Townshend, appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in August 1767. Within weeks of his arrival in Dublin he was complaining of a &#145;very severe letter&#146; from Shelburne, and later of &#145;the propensity Lord Shelburne always expresses to condemn my conduct&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.293, 298). With the duke of Grafton, Shelburne was on better terms, since both admired Chatham; however, neither had a high opinion of the other, and there were sharp clashes over patronage.<br>
<br>Nor were Shelburne's relations with the king himself much warmer than they had been during his first spell in office. Before the ministry had been in power a year, George III was writing to Chatham that he and Grafton regarded Shelburne as &#145;a secret enemy&#146; and suggesting his removal  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 1.480, no. 521). Shelburne survived, but suffered a significant setback when the supervision of the American colonies was removed from his department and given to a newly created American secretary, Lord Hillsborough. The king clearly hoped that Shelburne would resign in dudgeon, but he held on, waiting for Chatham's return. The junction with the Bedford group was yet another misfortune for him, since their views rarely coincided with his.<br>
<br>To these differences was added a major one in April 1768, when it became necessary for the ministry to decide its attitude towards Wilkes's election for Middlesex. At first Grafton and the cabinet inclined to a gentle approach to avoid giving Wilkes the crown of martyrdom, but in the course of time opinion hardened. Camden and Shelburne continued to urge caution, but the Bedfords were for strong measures, and the king wrote in April that &#145;the expulsion of Mr. Wilkes appears to be very essential and must be effected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 2.21, no. 613). But before the issue came to parliament Shelburne's fate had been sealed. Whateley reported to Grenville in May that Shelburne's dismissal was &#145;expected every day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 4.296). In September the king warned Grafton that &#145;Lord Shelburne manifestly still attempted to thwart every measure that originated from you, and seemed resolved to propose none himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 2.43, no. 651). But Camden, to whom this was confided, reminded the king that Shelburne was still under Chatham's protection, even if he had lost the good opinion &#145;of every one of the other active members of the cabinet&#146;  (ibid.). The following month the king again urged Grafton to sound out Chatham, believing that he would acquiesce in Shelburne's dismissal. He did not, but tendered his own resignation. Shelburne's resignation followed a week later.<h2>
<a name="Opposition"></a>Opposition</h2>During 1769, Grafton's administration, assaulted by Junius, fell to pieces, while Shelburne joined Rockingham and Grenville in opposition. The Wilkes issue rumbled on, with the momentous decision to seat the government candidate, Colonel Henry Luttrell, for Middlesex. Shelburne was a valuable recruit to opposition in the Lords, particularly since Rockingham was a notoriously poor and reluctant speaker. In his speech of 15 December 1768 Shelburne sniped at his former colleagues, for he was still waiting to see whether Chatham would return and what his line would be. In January 1770 Chatham, amazingly restored, appeared once more in the Lords, denounced the ministers for their policies on both America and Wilkes, declared that the liberty of the subject was in danger at home and abroad, and hinted darkly at a secret influence, &#145;a mysterious power&#146;, that lurked behind the scenes. This salvo carried away Camden, who resigned the chancellorship, and it appeared that the government was doomed: &#145;the seals would go a begging&#146;, said Shelburne, but he &#145;hoped there would not be found in the kingdom a wretch so base and mean-spirited as to accept of them&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 16, 1765&#150;71, 665). By the end of the month Grafton, too, had resigned. But the advantage did not fall to Chatham and Shelburne. Lord North took over as prime minister, and, while he was at first regarded as a mere stopgap, he established an administration which condemned Chatham to opposition for the rest of his life and Shelburne for the next twelve years.<br>
<br>Shelburne's private life was also difficult. He invested heavily in East India Company stock through his under-secretary Lauchlin Macleane and admitted losing &pound;40,000 in the 1769 crash, in which Macleane was completely ruined: though Shelburne gave up interfering in company matters, the suspicion of insider dealing did little for his reputation. His building programme at Bowood, at Wycombe Abbey, and at the large house in Berkeley Square, which he had purchased half-finished from Bute, made severe demands upon even his ample fortune. His way of life was lavish, with great hospitality extended to the remarkable coterie of friends and advisers whom he gathered round him. In addition, on 5 January 1771 his wife died in childbirth at the age of twenty-five. Shelburne left in May for a continental tour with Barr&eacute; to assuage his grief, during which he made the acquaintance of a large number of <i>philosophes</i>, including Beccaria, Turgot, Malesherbes, and Morellet, and became a convert to the new free-trade doctrine.<br>
<br>The hopes of opposition for a speedy return to power depended upon war with Spain over the Falkland Islands, which, they believed, must lead to Chatham's recall. While the issue was still in doubt, Shelburne declared that &#145;whether we commence a war with Spain or tamely crouch under the insults of that haughty kingdom&#146;, power could not remain &#145;in such feeble, in such incompetent hands&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 16, 1765&#150;71, 1113&#150;14). North negotiated a peaceful settlement of the dispute in January 1771, which the opposition naturally denounced as craven and cowardly. On 14 February 1771, in an attack upon the settlement, Shelburne spoke, according to Horace Walpole, &#145;better than he had ever done&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 4.275). On his return from the continental tour he took up the proposal of Dr Richard Price, one of his closest followers, that dissenting clergy should be released from the obligation to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. The ministers decided to let the measure through the Commons but kill it in the Lords, where it was rejected by 102 votes to 29. The East India Company, despite the settlement of 1767, got into further difficulty, and in 1772 was obliged to approach the government for a substantial loan. North agreed to rescue it, but subject to the appointment of a governor-general and a considerable degree of governmental control. Though the Rockinghams condemned the bill as a gross violation of charters, Shelburne gave it general support. William Lyttelton reported that Shelburne had &#145;never spoken better in his life&#146;, though his enemies hinted that he was angling for a return to office  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 4.284).<br>
<br>Shelburne was by now a leading member of the opposition and more than a mere mouthpiece for the ageing Chatham. He had a considerable following in the City of London, where he worked closely with James Townsend and the more moderate radicals. His electoral interest was useful. After spending &pound;100,000 on property in the neighbourhood, he controlled two seats at Calne and one at Wycombe and had influence in Wiltshire and Buckinghamshire. His parliamentary following, though small, was able, with John Dunning a rising lawyer and Barr&eacute; a formidable debater. His own parliamentary speeches were frequently informed and impressive, though he was sometimes tempted into lurid and melodramatic language, and he had a penchant for threatening severe punishment. Not only did this lay him open to easy retorts from the more adroit lords, it built up a residue of dislike which, in the end, proved costly.<br>
<br>Increasingly in the 1770s the political scene was dominated by the American troubles. Shelburne was perhaps handicapped by his strict adherence to Chatham's line, which, from 1773 onwards, looked unrealistic and sentimental. In January 1775 he supported Chatham's motion to withdraw British troops from Boston, condemning &#145;the madness, injustice and infatuation of coercing the Americans into a blind and servile submission&#146;: it was defeated by sixty-eight votes to eighteen  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 18, 1774&#150;6, 163). In a debate in February on an address urging the king to enforce obedience on the colonists, Shelburne clashed violently with Lord Mansfield, whom he accused of being the secret influence behind the American policy. In return he was attacked for &#145;uttering the most gross falsehoods&#146;  (ibid., 18.282). Once shots had been exchanged at Lexington, events developed their own momentum, and it was hard for the opposition not to appear factious and disloyal: &#145;the popular tide&#146;, Shelburne admitted, &#145;was against him&#146;  (ibid., 18.449). In November 1775 he paid handsome tribute to Chatham as &#145;the most efficient servant of the crown, and while he had life in him, the nerve of Great Britain&#146;  (ibid., 18.923&#150;4). It was not clear, however, how much life Chatham did have left in him, and his argument that the colonists were not really seeking independence looked more and more implausible. On 5 March 1776 Shelburne was said by Walpole to have made &#145;a great figure in the debate&#146; on Richmond's motion against the employment of German mercenaries in America  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>). On 14 March he made a major effort in support of Grafton's motion for some gesture of goodwill towards the colonists, pleading that a middle path was the only hope of avoiding disaster. It was defeated by ninety-one votes to twenty-eight. There was little chance that Shelburne and the opposition could change the direction of policy, but the possibility remained that Chatham might be invited to join the government, bringing Shelburne with him, especially after the news of Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga had been received in December 1777, carrying with it the probability that France and Spain would intervene. An important speech of 5 March 1778 on the American conciliation bills suggested a change of emphasis, if not of policy, on Shelburne's part. He told the Lords that he would:<blockquote>never consent that America should be independent &hellip; Great Britain should superintend the interests of the whole &hellip; as soon as that event should take place, the sun of Great Britain is set, and we shall no longer be a powerful or respectable people. (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 19, 1777&#150;8, 850)</blockquote>A week later North obtained the king's grudging permission to sound out Chatham through Shelburne: &#145;I do not expect Lord Chatham and his crew will come to your assistance&#146;, George warned North  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 4.58, no. 2221). The proposal, put forward by William Eden, was for Chatham to receive the Garter and join the cabinet, while Shelburne took his old post as secretary of state. Shelburne replied that Chatham &#145;must be dictator&#146; and would bring in the Rockinghams. The king's relief at the failure of the negotiations with Chatham, &#145;that perfidious man&#146;, was total  (ibid., 4.59, no. 2224). Three weeks later Chatham suffered his dramatic collapse in the House of Lords, and by May he was dead. Shelburne's motion that the House of Lords as an order should attend the funeral in Westminster Abbey was lost by one vote. But his final verdict on his former idol, recorded many years later, was much cooler:<blockquote>he was always acting, always made up, and never natural, incapable of friendship, and constantly upon the watch and never unbent &hellip; I was in the most intimate political habits with him for ten years &hellip; without drinking a glass of water in his house or company, or five minutes conversation out of the way of business. (Fitzmaurice, 1.72&#150;9)</blockquote>Chatham's death, though depriving Shelburne of a diminishing asset, liberated him from the need to consult and report. But his political behaviour became somewhat erratic. In a rambling speech of 26 November 1778, which contained veiled threats against the king, Shelburne called for a union of all parties to bring &#145;condign punishment&#146; on wicked and evil ministers; he would &#145;cheerfully cooperate with any set of men to drag them from their present situations&#146;, and bring them to justice  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 19, 1777&#150;8, 1318&#150;19). The following month he repeated his view that, without America, Britain would be but a petty state: &#145;he would never serve with any man who would consent to acknowledge the independence of America&#146;  (ibid., 20, 1779&#150;80, 40). This drove a wedge between him and his Rockingham allies and suggested that he was a man the court might approach. With North still anxious to lay down the burden of office, fresh negotiations took place. In February 1779 Grafton was entrusted with discussions for a general coalition, which got nowhere, though he recorded that Shelburne had promised not to contest the premiership with Rockingham. There were further discussions in November 1779 when Gower and Weymouth left the ministry. Shelburne attempted to inject some vigour into the proceedings by moving on 1 December a motion on the state of Ireland, which North feared would be the prelude to his own impeachment. Shelburne obliged with a strong personal attack, insisting that North's conduct was &#145;highly criminal&#146;  (ibid., 20.1169). North had suggested to the king that Shelburne could be &#145;easily induced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 4.501, no. 2855) to make up an administration with Gower and Thurlow. But Thurlow's conversation with Shelburne found him more inexplicit than ever: &#145;the more connection that could be preserved with America the better; but he did not say what the nature of that connection should be&#146;  (ibid., 4.521, no. 2882). Nor could he say whether the opposition would take part in a coalition. The king found this reply &#145;cold and distant&#146;  (ibid.), the negotiations came to nothing, and North was persuaded to soldier on.<br>
<br>Several episodes at this time throw light upon Shelburne's character and reputation. In 1777 an Irish adventurer, David Brown Dignam, accused him and other lords of a bizarre conspiracy to assassinate the king. Though Dignam was soon unmasked and sent to the hulks, he would not have picked on Shelburne had not the latter's French connections and his correspondence with Franklin and other Americans rendered him suspect. In 1778 Shelburne's engagement was announced to Frances Molesworth, a young, attractive, and wealthy heiress. But Eleanor Elliot wrote to her brother Hugh: &#145;she dined at his house and sat at the head of the table and was seen to cry all dinner-time &hellip; she sent Lady Lucan a letter and begged she would break off the detested match&#146;  (Minto, 147). Horace Walpole, no friend to Shelburne, conceded that he had been an &#145;admirable husband&#146; to his first wife, but there were reports that Miss Molesworth complained that Shelburne did nothing but talk politics to her  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.115). Shelburne's disappointment soon passed, and the following year he married Louisa Fitzpatrick (1755&#150;1789), the daughter of John Fitzpatrick, first earl of Upper Ossory, and his wife, Evelyn Leveson-Gower. They had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22071/', "Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, third marquess")</script>, and a daughter who died in infancy. On 22 March 1780, as a consequence of some characteristically sharp remarks in debate, Shelburne fought a duel with the Scottish MP William Fullarton. Shelburne behaved with military courage, was slightly wounded in the groin, and achieved fleeting popularity, since the Scots were even more disliked than he was. In 1778 he became acquainted with the young Jeremy Bentham, whose reminiscences of the Bowood circle are of value, but who repaid considerable hospitality and kindness from Shelburne with a verdict far from flattering.<br>
<br>The weight of wartime taxation and the development of the Yorkshire Association's campaign for economical reform put wind into the sails of the opposition during the winter of 1779&#150;80. Shelburne responded by moving on 8 February 1780 for a committee to examine the public accounts with a view to economy and a reduction in the influence of the crown. After a long debate the motion was rejected, though Shelburne was supported by fifty of the peers attending, eighty-one being against. But a further difference with Lord Rockingham arose when the economical reformers moved on to embrace parliamentary reform. Rockingham was mistrustful, but Shelburne, following the line chalked out by Chatham in the 1770s, favoured an increase in the number of county seats and shorter parliaments. The gap between the two groups widened dramatically with the Gordon riots in June 1780: the Rockinghams were strong supporters of law and order, while Shelburne's sympathy for the rioters was so great that he was accused of encouraging them. He was also, like Charles James Fox and many others, impatient at Rockingham's sluggish leadership. On 3 June 1780 he declared that, though he would not pledge himself, he would attend the House of Lords no more until there was &#145;a greater likelihood of speaking to some purpose&#146;  (Christie, 112&#150;13). The well-publicized split in the ranks of the opposition and the swing to the political right caused by the riots prompted a fresh negotiation for a government of national unity, but in the discussions held with Rockingham in July 1780 Shelburne was neither consulted nor mentioned. Shelburne was understandably nettled: &#145;I owe nothing to them&#146;, he wrote of the Rockinghams, &#145;and much to others &hellip; The conduct of others during the summer will abundantly justify silence and inaction&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 3.105&#150;6). Of Rockingham himself, he wrote: &#145;there he stands obstinately stopping the free course of popular spirit which alone can ever oppose the court&#146;  (ibid., 3.107). When he spoke in January 1781 on the breach with Holland, he began by telling the house that &#145;he had long determined to absent himself from his attendance there&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 21, 1780&#150;81, 1023). From this dangerous split the opposition was rescued by the news of Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown in October 1781.<br>
<br>Shelburne attended the opening of parliament on 27 November 1781 and moved an amendment to the address, arguing that financial debility and shortage of recruits made any further prosecution of the war in America impossible. In a debate of 7 February 1782 on the surrender of Yorktown, he took the opportunity to repeat that &#145;he would never consent, under any possible given circumstances, to acknowledge the independency of America&#146;  (ibid., 22, 1781&#150;2, 987). To the king this represented a signal that Shelburne was the least implacable of his opponents. Consequently, when Lord North insisted on resigning on 20 March, the king sent for Shelburne and expressed &#145;his preference of me compared to the rest of the opposition&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 3.131). This was not saying much, but the king was in a very difficult position and contemplating abdication. Shelburne declined to try to form an administration, telling Rockingham, &#145;you can stand without me, but I could not without you&#146;  (ibid., 3.131). The king refused categorically to deal directly with Rockingham but agreed to negotiate through Shelburne: in that decision were many of the seeds of the subsequent resentments. Buttressed by Dunning, to be brought into the cabinet as Lord Ashburton, and supported by Thurlow, to be retained as lord chancellor at the king's insistence, Shelburne would be in a powerful position. On 26 March George III wrote to him:<blockquote>Lord Shelburne's note I look upon as an instance of <i>personal</i> attention, and feel it as such: I trust from it, he has stood firm, and will have remembered that the powers intrusted to him in the ministerial line &hellip; gives him strength with more vigour to resist all others. (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 5.412&#150;13, no. 3582)</blockquote>Rockingham accordingly took the Treasury, with Fox and Shelburne as the two secretaries of state. On 19 April Shelburne was given the Garter.<h2>
<a name="Firstminister"></a>First minister</h2>The second Rockingham ministry was brief and unpleasant. The rifts in it were apparent before it took office&#151;indeed, they were built into it. Within a week of kissing hands, Shelburne and Rockingham were at odds about patronage: George III told Thurlow that &#145;Lord Shelburne expressed an uneasiness lest I should yield to the importunities of Lord Rockingham, which would reduce him to a Secretary of State, acting under the former, instead of a colleague&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 5.443, no. 3632). The king composed a bland formula, suggesting joint recommendations. Fox and Shelburne disputed in whose department negotiations with the Americans lay and finished up with rival plenipotentiaries in Paris. The implementation of economic reform also caused trouble. Of the debate in the Lords on 15 April, Shelburne reported to the king that &#145;I insisted that the proposed reduction of ministerial influence must make the struggle within and without doors who should contribute most to Your Majesty's dignity, comfort and splendour&#146;  (ibid., 5.463, no. 3665). This interpretation had occurred to no one before, but George III, not surprisingly, replied that &#145;nothing could be more proper than Lord Shelburne's language&#146;  (ibid., 5.464, no. 3666). Shelburne was already building up support, sending Thurlow to sound out Henry Dundas as early as April in case &#145;a breach of administration should ever happen as to leave him in possession of government&#146;. At a later meeting Dundas, a blunt Scot, found Shelburne's &#145;civility and courtship a little overdone upon so slight an acquaintance&#146;  (Cannon, <span class="italic">Fox&#150;North Coalition</span>, 12&#150;13).<br>
<br>One of Shelburne's main responsibilities was for Ireland, where the armed volunteers were demanding the immediate acknowledgement of legislative independence. In public, Shelburne declared handsomely that &#145;the voice of a people &hellip; ought to be attended to&#146;: in letters to his brother-in-law Richard Fitzpatrick, now chief secretary, he urged firmness and delay. To the king he confessed that, while it was &#145;a subject through which I do not see some sort of way&#146;, it was &#145;never off my mind&#146;. On American independence he was equally delphic. In cabinet and to the commanders in the field he accepted that independence was not a condition of peace, but a categorical offer: to the king he reported to the contrary&#151;that peace would be &#145;the price of independence&#146;  (Cannon, <span class="italic">Fox&#150;North Coalition</span>, 12&#150;13, 17&#150;18). Fox was considering resigning on the issue when rumours spread that Rockingham was gravely ill. Shelburne at once began making plans, discussing with the king what role, if any, Fox should play in the new government: &#145;it may not be necessary to remove him at once&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 6.70, no. 3825). As soon as Rockingham's death was known, the king offered Shelburne the Treasury.<br>
<br>Shelburne's ministry, the peak of his career, lasted eight months, for five of which parliament was in recess. His strongest card was his new chancellor of the exchequer, young William Pitt. But Pitt, who had already raised eyebrows with his declaration that he would never accept a junior post, was also a potential rival&#151;an obvious successor to an unpopular first minister. Lord Grantham became foreign secretary, Lord Temple went to Dublin as viceroy, and Thomas Townshend took the Home Office: the new recruits, thought Thurlow, who remained as lord chancellor, were &#145;not all of the most promising sort&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fifth Report</span>, HMC, 211). Dundas was brought in to augment the Commons team, John Robinson was recruited to give electoral advice, and in August the king wrote personally to beg North to use his influence on behalf of the ministry. Challenged by Fox to deny that his resignation was not pique but policy, Shelburne produced one of his classic responses: &#145;he made no such assertion; but he had certainly said, that &#147;in his opinion&#148;, that was the cause, and the exclusive cause, but he had not asserted it as a fact&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 23, 1782&#150;3, 200&#150;01).<br>
<br>Most of Shelburne's time in the summer was devoted to the peace negotiations, over which he exercised very close supervision. Until a late stage he entertained hopes of some form of federal union. The first setback was the American declaration that, if independence was not unconditionally acknowledged, negotiations were at an end: though the king grumbled that he did not see &#145;how the present ministry can consent to it&#146;, Shelburne gave way. A second problem was the American refusal to compensate the loyalists, insisting that this was a matter for the individual colonies&#151;a palpable evasion, which was bound to go down badly with the British public. At the same time Shelburne continued the complex process of economical reform, and though he wriggled out of any commitment to parliamentary reform, it meant that he was seriously overloaded. He had neither the time, nor probably the inclination, to consult widely or to carry his colleagues with him. Grafton, Camden, Richmond, Keppel, and Conway rebelled on a proposal to cede Gibraltar, and it had to be abandoned. Temple, in Dublin, was outraged that Shelburne could not find time to talk to his younger brother William Grenville, the chief secretary, about Irish problems. On 27 November 1782 Shelburne fell back on one of his stock phrases: &#145;the subject was never off his mind &hellip; and a great deal of such verbiage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court</span>, 1.67). On 7 December Grenville was mortified when Shelburne walked out while he was talking, and concluded that &#145;Lord Shelburne's evident intention is to make cyphers of his colleagues&#146;  (ibid., 1.84). A week later Shelburne produced another classic: &#145;he was <i>inclined to think</i>&#146;, Grenville reported to Temple, &#145;not that he <i>thought</i>, your government would go on there more easily than you expected&#146;  (ibid., 1.87). With that serene assurance, Temple had to be satisfied, and began to contemplate resignation.<br>
<br>Peace preliminaries with America were signed on 30 November, and Shelburne approached the meeting of parliament in a mood of unintelligible confidence. He had always shared Chatham's conviction that the support of the king was everything, but he possessed neither Chatham's oratory to fall back on nor his experience of the Commons. On 13 November he assured Lord Carmarthen that his opponents in the Lower House would not exceed sixty&#151;&#145;which he had reason to be assured of, tho' it appeared scarce credible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Memoranda</span>, 76). Next he told Fitzpatrick that he understood nothing of the Commons, &#145;but that they show him <i>a very good list</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials and Correspondence</span>, 2.10). This was Robinson's estimate of probable voting, itself based upon the assumption that the king would bring North and his troops to the support of the ministry. On 18 December 1782 Grenville reported another meeting with Shelburne:<blockquote>I never heard any man, in the whole course of my life, affirm any one thing more distinctly, positively and unequivocally, than he did, when he told me that Government were on a sure foundation here&#151;there was a moral certainty &hellip; Either Lord Shelburne is &hellip; the most abandoned and direct liar upon the face of the earth, or he is deceived himself, too grossly to be imagined. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court</span>, 1.89)</blockquote>Nor had the opening day in parliament gone well. The issue of recognition of American independence returned to haunt him. In the Commons, Pitt declared that it was unconditional: in the Lords, Shelburne declared the opposite. Fox and his friends made the most of their advantage, and though the king suggested that Pitt must have got it wrong and could correct himself, Pitt did not take kindly to the idea. It was, Shelburne admitted, &#145;awkward&#146;, and in the Lords he was forced to take refuge in refusing to answer questions on the subject  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 6.175, no. 4014). Worst of all were signs that the king was beginning to harbour doubts about his new first minister. Deploring the administration's poor showing in the Lords on 5 December, he remarked that these mishaps would not occur &#145;if there was any energy or discipline in government&#146;  (ibid., 6.173, no. 4012). On the 8th he declared that &#145;it is highly material that Lord Shelburne should not by any language in the House of Lords appear to change his conduct, let the blame fall where it may. I do not wish that he should appear but in a dignified light&#146;  (ibid., 6.175&#150;6, no. 4015).<br>
<br>With Fox and Shelburne quite irreconcilable, the fate of the ministry turned on North and his friends. But North was by no means a free agent, and it is doubtful whether he could have carried most of his followers in support of the peace. Setting aside personalities, the failure to secure compensation for the loyalists was bound to be a sticking point for men who had, for seven years, supported the American war. Preoccupied with the peace negotiations, Shelburne left his approach to North far too late, partly because Pitt remained opposed to any such move. In the meantime Shelburne scarcely seemed to notice that his government was disintegrating. Keppel resigned from the Admiralty on 23 January 1783, Carlisle gave up the lord high stewardship, Richmond left the cabinet, and Grafton, always unsteady, resigned on the day of the debate on the peace. North's understanding with Fox was agreed on 14 February and announced in parliament on the 18th. In the Lords, Shelburne offered a rather rambling and theatrical defence but carried the day, in a very full house, by seventy-two votes to fifty-nine. In the Commons, despite surprise at the new coalition, Fox and North held most of their supporters and defeated the ministry by 224 to 208. At this point Shelburne's unpopularity came into play. A rearguard action was not out of the question, but hardly any of his colleagues wished Shelburne to continue, and he seems himself to have been exhausted, bewildered, and demoralized. Carmarthen, who dined with him on the 20th, found him &#145;totally devoid of spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Memoranda</span>, 82). He had been so convinced that the king's support would be decisive that he had no contingency plans and could scarcely comprehend what had happened. His friends hinted at treachery at court. Orde reported the opinion of John Hatsell, clerk to the Commons, that &#145;the stability or downfall to your administration depends solely (as Your Lordship has always said) upon the <i>Highest</i> &hellip; It is his will&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 3.361). This was arrant nonsense. Nor is it clear why the opinion of a Commons clerk on such a matter should carry much weight, but it was perhaps easier for Shelburne to believe that he had been betrayed than to admit that he had totally misjudged the situation. In a second debate on 21 February, Pitt acquitted himself magnificently. However, that was of little comfort for Shelburne since it established Pitt firmly as the heir apparent, and much of his speech sounded like a political obituary for Shelburne, abandoned to the admiration of posterity: &#145;when stripped of his power and emoluments, he once more descends to private life &hellip; men will see him through a different medium&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 23, 1782&#150;3, 551). The opposition won again by 207 to 190, and the following day Shelburne was told that he must resign.<br>
<br>Shelburne stayed in office until 26 March to enable a new administration to be formed. Though he remained active in the Lords for more than twenty years, his political career was over. He spoke bitterly afterwards of the king as a man who &#145;obtained your confidence, procured from you your opinion of different public characters, and then availed himself of this knowledge to sow dissension&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 3.363). Hardly any of his associates mourned his departure. Horace Walpole's vituperation may be ascribed to Shelburne's threat to his sinecures: &#145;he was so well known that he could only deceive by speaking truth &hellip; He was so fond of insincerity as if he had been the inventor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>, 2.465). But few found him pleasant to work with. George Rose declared he would never be in the same room with him again: &#145;the alternate violence and flattery of Lord Shelburne &hellip; made my situation so thoroughly unpleasant to me that I felt the certain removal from office as a relief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries and Correspondence</span>, 1.25&#150;8). William Knox wrote that &#145;those who served with him in office abhorred him as a principal&#146;, and Sir Stanier Porten claimed to have told him &#145;God be thanked I am not going to be under you again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 6.283). He might perhaps have found a niche as a reforming minister under some enlightened despot, but, in a parliamentary system which called for some capacity to work with other people, his basic insecurity meant that he found it almost impossible to establish tolerable relations.<h2>
<a name="Aftermath"></a>Aftermath</h2>Since at the time of his resignation Shelburne was only forty-five, a return to power was not impossible. A strange speech in May 1783 did little to restore his reputation. He denied that the House of Commons had the sole right to consider money bills, and added: &#145;with regard to the argument that he had lost the confidence of the House of Commons, he did not believe he had lost it, but let the House of Commons beware or they would lose my confidence&#146;. The House of Commons bore this threat with equanimity, the House of Lords declined to pick a quarrel on money bills, and Shelburne's comeback finished with an acrimonious exchange with his former colleague Keppel  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 23, 1782&#150;3, 824). The coalition ministry which followed lasted only until December 1783 and was succeeded by Pitt's. But Pitt, according to George Rose, was &#145;as little disposed to further connexion with Lord Shelburne as myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries and Correspondence</span>, 1.32), and Townshend (now Lord Sydney) confided to Orde that to bring back Shelburne would be as alarming as bringing back Lord Bute. At a later date Bentham reported a conversation with Shelburne who &#145;complained repeatedly of Pitt and Thurlow for breach of faith &hellip; it seemed to sit very heavy on him&#146;  (Bentham, 10.214). Nursing his resentments, he did not attend to vote against Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span>. In August 1784 Daniel Pulteney wrote that the only thing that could endanger Pitt's government would be to give a place to Shelburne &#145;where he can be credited to be prime minister&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 3.132). Pitt's solution was to obtain for Shelburne promotion to a marquessate in November 1784. This did not mollify him for long. In October 1785 Orde found him at Bowood &#145;not in the most satisfactory temper with the ministers&#146;, and in March 1786 Shelburne&#151;now Lord Lansdowne&#151;admitted that he found the ministry's attitude towards him &#145;unaccountable&#146;  (ibid., 250, 287). Meanwhile the coalition wits pilloried him in <span class="italic">The Rolliad</span> as &#145;the sylvan sage, whom Bowood guards to rule a purer age&#146;, and made fun of his contorted language. His small following collapsed. Dunning died in August 1783, Townsend followed in July 1787, and Barr&eacute; went blind. The duke of Rutland, lord lieutenant of Ireland, who had lobbied Pitt on Lansdowne's behalf, died in October 1787 at the age of thirty-three. Of his newer associates, Bentham was unfitted for parliamentary life and Samuel Romilly did not enter parliament until after Lansdowne's death.<br>
<br>Lansdowne continued to speak in the Lords, but as a commentator, or even a lecturer, rather than a leading politician. In June 1785 he took the opportunity of Pitt's Irish commercial propositions to reiterate his belief in free trade, and he repeated the argument when he gave strong support to the commercial treaty with France in March 1787, denying that France was a natural enemy of Britain. Even then he became involved in another angry exchange with a former colleague, Richmond, which smouldered on for several days. In 1788 he spoke and voted on the government side over the proposed regency.<br>
<br>It is possible that the death of his second wife on 7 August 1789 would have pushed Lansdowne back into politics in any case, but the advent of the French Revolution was certain to call him into action. His close contacts with French writers and statesmen, among them Mirabeau and Talleyrand, made him sympathetic, and he was convinced that the French sought only a liberal constitution. His judgement was not noticeably better than that of his colleagues. He greatly approved of the French nobility abandoning their separate order and joining the Third Estate, which, he insisted, would give them vast influence. He believed that the revolution would grow less violent and that the continental powers would not intervene. Most obvious was his growing antipathy towards Pitt, with whom he had already had differences over Indian affairs and the impeachment of Hastings. The first public evidence of the breach came in his speech of 13 December 1790 on the settlement with Spain at the end of the Nootka Sound crisis. In a long survey of the foreign policy of Pitt's government he claimed that, as soon as Frederick the Great had died in 1786, ministers had abandoned their pacific stance and sought to terrify and intimidate every court in Europe. By 1791 he was in persistent opposition, joining the strong censure of Pitt's handling of the Ochakov crisis with Russia, which forced the minister into a humiliating withdrawal. Lansdowne, reported Sydney in June 1791, was &#145;in a state of great and extraordinary political violence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 2.142). The diplomatic rebuff forced the resignation of the foreign secretary and shook Pitt's position, and in the spring of 1792 there were negotiations for a coalition, in which Lansdowne played some part. Gillray produced a caricature, entitled <span class="italic">Malagrida's Driving Post</span>, which showed him entering St James's Palace while Fox and Sheridan begged a lift, and the Bowood archives include a rather strange memo by Lansdowne, more of a disquisition than a working paper, on the possibilities of a change of ministry. The negotiations failed, but in the summer Thurlow was dismissed and Loughborough took his place as lord chancellor.<br>
<br>Under these circumstances, Fox and Lansdowne edged closer. Their rapprochement was assisted by Fox's friendly treatment in the House of Commons of Lansdowne's son Lord Wycombe, which contrasted with Pitt's scorn. Some more formal understanding was needed in 1793 after the outbreak of war hardened the divisions in parliament. To Fox's initiative, Lansdowne responded by asking whether a mere reconciliation or an avowed junction was intended. Lord Spencer wrote in February 1794 that &#145;Lord Lansdowne stands as clearly at the head of the opposition in one house as Mr Fox does at the head of that in the House of Commons&#146;  (Mitchell, 232), but wondered whether a formal coalition would do much to improve Fox's popularity. The following year Fox admitted that &#145;I never can have a good opinion of him, and still less a great one. However, we are upon terms of the greatest civility&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials and Correspondence</span>, 3.112&#150;13). They agreed to consult in the unlikely event of an approach from the court. In the meantime Lansdowne's opposition to the war led to a fresh campaign of vilification in the newspapers as a friend of the Jacobins. Caricaturists had a field day, portraying him as a French agent or a sans-culotte, shouting &#145;&Ccedil;a ira!&#146;, wearing the cap of liberty, and working the guillotine, usually with a bland smile. His parliamentary activity increased considerably. He insisted that any attempt to invade France would be doomed to failure, warned of the danger of turning France into &#145;a military republic &hellip; impossible to extinguish&#146;, and predicted that France might produce a military genius&#151;&#145;great moments have always produced great men&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 30, 1792&#150;4, 1395). His motion was rejected by 103 votes to thirteen. In May 1794 he protested strongly against the suspension of habeas corpus, complaining that the committee of secrecy was made up of alarmists, and in January 1795 he supported the duke of Bedford's motion for peace with France. But his renewed activity made it less rather than more likely that he would be recalled to active service, and he admitted ruefully that &#145;the tide of popularity was against him&#146;  (ibid., 31, 1794&#150;5, 973). In a debate on the <span class="roman">Seditious Meetings Bill</span> in December 1795 he agreed that precautions against subversion were needed&#151;&#145;an admission which, he trusted, would at least be sufficient to exempt him from the charge of Jacobinism&#146;  (ibid., 32, 1795&#150;7, 534). But he was trapped in the same position as in the 1770s when he had opposed the American war, and he conceded that he attended reluctantly, when all he could do was to issue warnings of dire disaster. &#145;Not one session had passed since 1793&#146;, he declared in 1797 in a rare moment of wry humour, &#145;in which he had not bored their lordships with his prophetic admonitions&#146;  (ibid., 32, 1795&#150;7, 1564). The isolation of the leaders of the opposition forced them closer. In February 1796 Fox wrote that<blockquote>the circumstances of the times will of themselves bring me and Lansdowne together &hellip; we are indeed now upon a very good footing and quite sufficiently so to enable us to act cordially together, if any occasion offers to doing so usefully. (<span class="italic">Memorials and Correspondence</span>, 3.129)</blockquote>There was a flurry of excitement in February 1801 when a recurrence of the king's illness made possible a regency for the prince of Wales, an ardent admirer of Fox. Lansdowne and Fox agreed to serve as secretaries of state under Lord Moira, which would have reconstituted the unhappy partnership of the spring of 1782, and Lord Wycombe was pencilled in for the Admiralty. But the king recovered within four weeks, and Lansdowne's last moment had passed. He lived to see his younger son, Lord Henry Petty, lay the foundations of a distinguished parliamentary career, and he made his last speech on 23 May 1803, arguing that none of Napoleon's provocations justified a resumption of the war. The motion was lost by 142 votes to ten. He died at his house in Berkeley Square on 7 May 1805 and was buried at High Wycombe.<br>
<br>A good and ready speaker, a formidable debater, more persistent and better informed than almost all his contemporaries, particularly among the peerage, Lansdowne was in the centre of politics for forty years, held high office on four occasions, was awarded the Garter (1782) and was raised in the peerage (1784). Nevertheless, his career was a failure and he felt it dearly: &#145;his mind is soured&#146;, wrote Thomas Orde in 1786  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 3.324). At the end of his life, in a fragment of autobiography, he reflected on the causes of his lack of success. He deplored his education; complained that as a child only one aunt, Lady Arbella Denny, had shown him any real affection; and lamented that &#145;it has been my fate through life to fall in with clever but unpopular connections&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.17). In all of this there was a certain amount of self-deception. He was certainly not worse educated than most of his aristocratic contemporaries, and his later circle at Bowood included such distinguished men as Dunning, Price, Priestley, and Bentham. Early in his political career he was associated with Bute and Henry Fox, who were certainly disliked. But men can choose their associates. His patrons were out of active politics by 1766, and soon Shelburne himself was the unpopular connection other people shunned, collecting more than his share of political abuse as &#145;Malagrida&#146; (arch-dissembler) or &#145;the Jesuit of Berkeley Square&#146;. There are other and more plausible explanations of the mistrust he aroused and the disappointment he suffered. His uneasiness prompted him to alternate flattery and hectoring, which most of his colleagues found unpleasant, and to suspiciousness, of which his son complained forcefully while abroad in 1785. In debate he was frequently vituperative and sarcastic&#151;Daniel Pulteney referred in 1787 to his &#145;sneering manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 3.376)&#151;and Lord Holland, in a very fair assessment, wrote that his speeches &#145;were not only animated and entertaining, but embittered the contest&#146;  (Holland, 1.42). His early success was resented by his fellow peers, who regarded him as a pushy Irish upstart, and his very brief membership of the Commons (he never took his seat) left him seriously underestimating the importance of that house. His advocacy of popular and reformist policies&#151;free trade, religious toleration, economical reform, and parliamentary reform&#151;while commending him to some later historians, won little praise from the governing &eacute;lite of Hanoverian Britain. Bentham thought that Lansdowne was muddle-headed, with a tendency to embrace grand schemes without fully understanding them, and though it would be difficult for anyone to attain Bentham's standards of rigour and logic, Lansdowne could become confused. His reluctance to delegate meant that he was often overworked: &#145;of all ministers&#146;, wrote one subordinate, &#145;he was the most difficult to please, never satisfied with what anyone did, or even what he did himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 6.283).<br>
