<span class="headword">Petit,  Lewis</span> <span class="st"> [Lewis Petit des Etans]</span>  (1665?&#150;1720), <span class="occ">military engineer and army officer</span>, was (according to notes made by his descendant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22037/', "John Louis Petit")</script>) a member of the family of Petit des Etans of Caen in Normandy, but rarely used the toponym. He arrived in England after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685, and entered the service of the Board of Ordnance. He served with the ordnance train in Ireland from 19 June 1691 until the following May, when he was employed in the ordnance train with the Channel Fleet on the summer expeditions of 1692 and 1693. These attacks against the French coast produced little result, and in July 1693, having landed at Ostend, the train took part in the capture of Furnes, Dixmude, and Ghent. On 1 April 1697 Petit was appointed an engineer on the English establishment and may have been on half-pay until, in May 1700, he was warranted to fill a vacancy on the peace train, so called because the existence of a train of artillery in peacetime was a novelty. At about this time, perhaps in 1698, Petit married Marianne, daughter of John Meslin of Glatigny in Normandy.<h2>
<a name="EarlycampaignsintheWaroftheSpanishSuccession"></a>Early campaigns in the War of the Spanish Succession</h2>In 1702 Petit served as engineer with the train that accompanied the expedition to Cadiz and subsequently to Vigo. He was among the engineers in the ordnance train created by royal warrant dated 24 July 1703 to proceed to Portugal in support of the pretensions of the archduke Charles of Austria to the Spanish throne, in opposition to the French-born Philip V, of the Bourbon dynasty. In 1704 he was present at Portalegre as engineer and was taken prisoner when James Fitzjames, duke of Berwick, commanding the Bourbon forces, laid siege and captured it. Henri Massue de Ruvigny, earl of Galway, complaining of the difficulty of finding good engineers, wrote on 30 November 1704 that Petit was very capable, and ought to be among the first to be exchanged and returned to Portugal. Petit was with the ordnance train arriving at Gibraltar in mid-February 1705.<br>
<br>The siege of Gibraltar was raised by the end of April and Petit was appointed chief engineer of the ordnance train accompanying the forces directed against Barcelona under Charles Mordaunt, third earl of Peterborough. The fleet arrived before Barcelona on 22 August. The outlying fort of Montjuic capitulated on 18 September. The attack on the town itself began with Petit erecting batteries on the side previously protected by the guns of Montjuic, ordnance from the fleet being hauled up from the beach by seamen. Eight guns and three mortars opened fire on 24 September, and four days later the whole complement of fifty-eight were in action. Petit was slightly wounded on 25 September but was out of action only briefly. His ceaseless energy was rewarded when on 3 October a breach was made and the following day negotiations for the capitulation began.<br>
<br>The loss of Barcelona was keenly felt in Versailles and Madrid, where preparations were made to mount a massive expeditionary force by land and sea to recover it. Peterborough had dispersed his forces across Catalunya leaving the fortress of Barcelona with a garrison of 1400 men and a small ordnance train under Petit, though the garrison was augmented at the last moment. In the first days of April 1706 the besiegers, amounting to 21,000 men, with King Philip and Marshal Tess&eacute; at their head, had surrounded the city. Petit had exerted himself in repairing and strengthening the defences, including Montjuic, where the Bourbon attack commenced on 4 April. After heavy fighting, on 25 April the garrison of Montjuic was forced to withdraw into Barcelona, leaving the fort to Tess&eacute; and his forces. Within a few days guns were playing on the walls of the town and breaches were soon made. Petit now constructed retrenchments to isolate the weak points. On 3 May the besiegers began mining operations which Petit met with countermines, blowing in the enemy's galleries and checking their advance. Nevertheless, matters were now desperate for the defenders and only the arrival on 8 May of the van of a relieving squadron from Lisbon caused the siege to be lifted.<br>
<br>The two sieges established Petit's reputation as a resourceful engineer and an officer of spirit. James Stanhope later referred to Petit's &#145;eminent services in both sieges of Barcelona the good success of which may chiefly be imparted to him&#146;  (Stanhope of Chevening MSS, U1590 0132/1, Centre for Kentish Studies, Maidstone, Kent). Archduke Charles, who had been present throughout the second siege, wrote to Queen Anne praising Petit's zeal and application, and appointed him his chief engineer. Petit was present at the disastrous allied defeat at Almanza on 25 April 1707 when the earl of Galway was overcome by a much superior force. Galway sent away the ordnance train ahead of his own retreat and it arrived safely at Valencia. Galway apparently conferred on Petit the rank of &#145;premier ingenieur en Espagne&#146; with effect from 1 May 1707.<br>
<br>On 11 May the field train from Almanza arrived at Tortosa where Petit, now promoted colonel, was directed to put the works into condition to withstand a siege. Tortosa was attacked on 11 June 1708 when the duke of Orl&eacute;ans invested it with a force of 22,000 men. A spirited defence and heavy French casualties were insufficient to defer the inevitable surrender of the town on 10 July. Petit had been energetic in the defence and was conducted to Barcelona with the rest of the garrison under the terms of the capitulation. By the end of July he was at Tarragona.<h2>
<a name="Minorca"></a>Minorca</h2>At the end of August, Petit joined Stanhope, now in command in Spain, as chief engineer on the expedition to capture the island of Minorca. An allied force sailed from Barcelona on 3 September, met Admiral Sir John Leake off Minorca, and effected a landing. The unfortified town of Mah&oacute;n submitted immediately, as did the remainder of the island. Resistance would come only from the fortress of St Philip's Castle, a substantial stronghold commanding the entrance to Port Mah&oacute;n. The greatest problem for Petit was to transport the siege equipment from the landing place to the vicinity of St Philip's. By 23 September the guns had been brought up and emplacements were begun. On 28 September they began to fire and within five hours some of the defenders' guns were put out of action, at which Stanhope ordered a general advance. The besiegers gained a strong position near the fortress, and on the following day the French governor sent to ask for terms. On 30 September Stanhope, who could hardly have expected so easy a victory, marched into St Philip's.<br>
<br>Stanhope established Petit in command of the new possession, his eventual appointment by royal warrant being as &#145;lieutenant-governor of the town and garrison of Port Mahon &hellip; and of the castles, forts and all other military works and fortifications thereunto belonging&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 44/173, 74). Stanhope conferred the civil governorship of the island on a Spanish adherent of Archduke Charles to buttress the pretence that Minorca was held by the archduke as Carlos III of Spain, while Petit's warrant specifically commanded him to admit none but her majesty's own troops into the garrison and forts belonging to it. No doubt Petit's profession made him particularly suitable to command, for Stanhope had ambitious projects in mind for the fortification of Port Mah&oacute;n.<br>
<br>Stanhope next gave Petit the rank of brigadier in the archduke's service. Petit was also made inspector-general of the fortifications, her majesty's chief engineer, paymaster of the works, commissary of the train, and furnisher of bread for the garrison, and in addition he was chief engineer for Archduke Charles. His emoluments amounted to &pound;2 10<i>s</i>. a day.<br>
<br>Stanhope soon returned to Barcelona leaving Petit with the urgent task of measuring and costing the extensive projects for fortifications they had discussed. Work on the fortifications was funded by Stanhope from the extraordinaries of the war, and regular payments were sent to Petit throughout 1709. His first project was to build a 30-gun battery commanding the mouth of the harbour and linked to St Philip's. The estimates for enlarging St Philip's totalled about &pound;100,000. Money ran out in the middle of 1710, when work slowed considerably.<br>
<br>Petit somehow found time to enter into commercial speculations on his own account. In partnership with two Spaniards and Stanhope's secretary Arent Furley, Petit purchased a French prize at Mah&oacute;n for 7800 dollars with which to trade between Minorca, Majorca, Sardinia, and the Spanish and Barbary coasts. He advised Furley that he had found it necessary to use funds supplied for the fortifications to complete the purchase, and urgently requested capital from his partners to repay this misappropriation. Petit's participation was valuable to the enterprise owing to his ability to land cargoes at Mah&oacute;n without paying duty, an activity much objected to by the local town government.<br>
<br>In May 1711 John Campbell, second duke of Argyll, arrived in Spain as commander-in-chief. It marked a sea change in Petit's fortunes. Argyll never acknowledged Petit's rank of brigadier, it being a foreign commission, and in little more than a fortnight of his arrival at Barcelona and before having set foot in Minorca he wrote: &#145;I am more and more dissatisfied every day with Colonel Petit's behaviour at Port Mahon and am therefore resolved to put Colonel Farmer &hellip; in his place of Lieutenant Governour of Mahon&#146;  (Argyll to Earl Poulett, 17 June 1711, CUL, Add. MS 6570). Argyll objected that Petit had accepted a commission as lieutenant-governor from the king of Spain and made use of the Spanish colours, though such matters were approved by Stanhope. However, the replacement of Petit as lieutenant-governor was delayed until, as Argyll put it, &#145;our affairs are in less disorder&#146;.<br>
<br>Petit was soon to find himself under the scrutiny of the inspectors sent from London to investigate irregularities in the expenditure of the army in Spain, as an attempt to disgrace the previous ministry. Stanhope was foremost in their sights, but Petit, having had at his discretion the disposal of such large sums, inevitably figured largely in the inquiry. The accusations against him concerned imperfections in his accounts, including allegations of missing vouchers, irregularities, and overcharging in the numbers of workmen and mules, and alleged differences between prices contracted and prices paid, among other charges. Petit was at the commissioners' disposal for these investigations from 26 January 1712, which he gives as the date of his supersession by Argyll, until 20 November following when he left for England. His accounts remained unresolved until July 1726, six years after his death. Adjustments in favour of the commissioners were small; few of the accusations against him stuck.<h2>
<a name="Latercareeranddeath"></a>Later career and death</h2>Petit returned to England via France, landing in late November at Toulon, where he had a brother. His journey overland to Paris and the channel ports was tracked by the French authorities, who were aware of his identity. He next headed the list of engineers for home service dated 14 May 1714. In September he was sent to advise on the state of the works at Fort William and the other forts and castles in Scotland. Returning to London on 24 November, he laid his report before the board. In August 1715 he was ordered to Portsmouth to assist in putting it into a proper posture of defence. On 27 November a warrant was issued for the formation of an ordnance train for Scotland and Petit was appointed chief engineer, but the Jacobite rising was soon over and the train arrived too late for active service. After the rebellion Petit surveyed the head of Loch Ness for a fort, and he was in Scotland until the summer of 1716.<br>
<br>On 3 July 1716 a warrant was issued appointing Petit chief engineer at Minorca in the place of Brigadier Peter Durand, who had died there the previous December. Petit's Minorca accounts for 1708 to 1712, which had been investigated, remained outstanding in the hands of the Treasury: certain debts he had contracted in connection with the fortifications at Mah&oacute;n had not been settled. Petit could not go to Minorca while these matters were pending. A royal warrant was issued on 5 September 1717 authorizing the auditor to make up and pass his accounts, but with no immediate result. On 22 April of that year Petit had become director of engineers at Minorca at 20<i>s</i>. a day. He eventually proceeded to the island in 1718, and work at St Philip's commenced by his authority on 21 June. On 18 November 1718 a royal warrant was issued appointing him lieutenant-governor of Fort St Philip. In the absence of the governor and lieutenant-governor of Minorca the command devolved on him, as occurred for a period in 1719.<br>
<br>Petit went to Naples in January 1720, but whether for his health or seeking materials for the works at Mah&oacute;n is uncertain. He died in Naples on or after 24 May 1720 (the date of his will)&#151;and probably before the end of May as he was not paid thereafter. He was buried in Naples, and survived by his wife. Petit also left two sons, John Peter (1699&#150;1747) and Peter John (1700&#150;1768), who were captains in regiments of foot and sub-engineers and who served at Minorca under their father from 1718 and for a period after his death; and four daughters, Henrietta, Judith, Susanna, and Clara. John Lewis Petit (1736&#150;1780) and John Louis Petit (1801&#150;1868) were descendants.<br>
