<span class="headword">Forsyth,  Peter Taylor</span>  (1848&#150;1921), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born on 12 May 1848 at 100 Chapel Street, Aberdeen, the eldest child in the family of two sons and three daughters of Isaac Forsyth, from the Cabrach, a bookseller and later postman, and a deacon at the Blackfriars Street Congregational Church, Aberdeen, and his wife, Elspet McPherson, a crofter's daughter from Kingussie, Inverness-shire. Forsyth was educated from 1859 at Aberdeen grammar school, and entered Aberdeen University in 1864. After graduating MA with first-class honours in classical literature in 1869, he spent one year as a private tutor, and then from 1871 to 1872 was an assistant to Professor Black in the department of humanities at King's College, Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Following a period of study in G&ouml;ttingen in 1872 under Albrecht Ritschl, Forsyth started theological studies in September 1872 at Hackney Theological College, Hampstead, but did not complete the course, leaving in 1874. The writings of F. D. Maurice were an early influence on him. In London he became a member of the congregation of James Baldwin Brown, a liberal Congregational minister in Brixton, and in 1876 he was ordained minister at the Congregational church in Shipley, Yorkshire. On 4 April 1877 he married Maria Hester (Minna), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Magness (1850/51&#150;1894). They had one daughter. After his wife's death, he married on 25 September 1897 Emily Bertha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ison (<i>b</i>. 1866/7), of Oxford. For twenty-five years Forsyth held a series of appointments as minister: St Thomas's Square, Hackney (1880&#150;85); Cheetham Hill Congregational Church, Manchester (1885&#150;8); Clarendon Park, Leicester (1888&#150;94); and Emmanuel Church, Cambridge (1894&#150;1901).<br>
<br>During this period Forsyth began to publish, starting with <span class="italic">Pulpit Parables for Young Hearers</span> in 1886. <span class="italic">Religion in Recent Art</span> appeared in 1889, based on lectures on Pre-Raphaelite paintings and Richard Wagner's <span class="italic">Parsifal</span>. His early leanings towards socialism were evident in articles he wrote under a pseudonym from 1885 to 1889 for the <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner</span>.<br>
<br>In 1899 Forsyth was one of the delegates to the International Congregational Council in Boston, and he made several further trips to North America, including one in 1907 to give the Lyman Beecher lectures at Yale University. In 1901 he became principal of Hackney College, Hampstead, and in 1905 he was elected chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. In 1911 he was appointed dean of the faculty of theology at London University. Aberdeen University awarded him an honorary DD in 1895. Forsyth was very distressed at the outbreak of the First World War, for he loved Germany and German literature, and had been greatly influenced by German theologians such as Jakob Boehme; but he was not a pacifist, and in <span class="italic">The Justification of God</span> (1916) he supported the war.<br>
<br>Forsyth came to be regarded as the greatest Congregational theologian of his day. Reacting against his early liberalism, he adopted views that some have seen as anticipating those of Karl Barth and Emil Brunner. While he was an enthusiastic supporter of biblical criticism, he denounced much contemporary theology as no more than a shallow humanitarianism: &#145;The liberal theology finds Christ's centre of gravity in what he has in common with us; a positive theology in that wherein he differs&#146;. This issue was what divided him from R. J. Campbell, then minister of the City Temple in London, during the sustained New Theology controversy of 1907&#150;10. Deeply influenced by the philosophical idealism of the day, Campbell claimed that deity and humanity were fundamentally one. Forsyth contended that to reduce the power of the gospel to a merely &#145;human&#146; Jesus, without the cross as the heart of the Christian message, would be fatal. The heart of Forsyth's theology was that the holiness of God needed to deal drastically with the sin of humanity; his sermon on the Holy Father (first published in the <span class="italic">Christian World Pulpit</span> in 1896) marked a focal point in his life. In <span class="italic">The Person and Place of Jesus Christ</span> (1909), a book often regarded as his best, he found the two-nature doctrine of Christ deficient, inclining to the kenotic theory, which he modified by thinking of a &#145;pleroma&#146; following the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus.<br>
<br>Forsyth's writing is that of a passionate preacher, but his epigrammatic style is not to everyone's taste. It is also true that to wrestle with his thought demands a rethinking of the gospel: that his students found him so witty and stimulating a teacher is understandable. Forsyth died on 11 November 1921 at his home at Hackney College, Finchley Road, Hampstead, survived by his wife.<br>
