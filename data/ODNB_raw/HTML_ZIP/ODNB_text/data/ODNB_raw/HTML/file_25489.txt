<span class="headword">Shuter,  Edward <span class="st"> [Ned]</span></span>  (1728?&#150;1776), <span class="occ">actor and singer</span>, may have been born in 1728 but, as with so much else regarding the early life of this most colourful of actors, this is conjectural. Contemporary accounts such as the <span class="italic">Theatrical Biography</span> (1772) say that he was the son of a chair-man and an oyster woman and was born in a cellar in Covent Garden, whereas Shuter said:<blockquote>my Mother sold Oysters in the Winter, and Cucumbers in the Summer, yet I do solemnly aver, that I was not born in a Cellar, but in a front room up two pairs of stairs, at one Mr. Merit's, an eminent Chimney-Sweeper, in Vine-street, St. Gile's. (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>)</blockquote>It is possible that his father was Edward Shuter, the son of Francis and Mary Shuter, born on 18 May 1699 and baptized at St Anne's, Westminster, on 28 May.<br>
<br>The majority of accounts refer to Shuter working as a pot-boy in taverns in and about Covent Garden, where he made acquaintance with actors by delivering beer to the theatres. It is likely that his informal connection with the stage began in 1741, when he was associated with John Frederick Lampe and his wife, Isabella, the actor James Worsdale, and the actor&#150;manager Thomas Chapman, who formed a company to perform Lampe's operas in Preston and Chester. Shuter was seen by the young Charles Burney, who recorded:<blockquote>young Shuter, who had attended Mr &amp; Mrs Lampe as a footboy in Preston, and who now served them in that capacity at the Golden Falcon at Chester &hellip; was such a pickle, and contrived to mount the stage in the absence of Worsdale, and took him off so exactly that he rec'd even more applause than Worsdale. (C. Burney, &#145;Fragments of an autobiography&#146;, BL, Add. MS 48345)</blockquote>Shuter's more formal introduction to the stage evidently occurred at this time through Chapman, who managed the summer theatre in Richmond, Surrey, from 1730 through to 1747. Chapman acted in the patent theatres during the winter, ran a billiard room in Bow Street, and taught acting. The Richmond Theatre playbill of 8 September 1744 announces &#145;Master Shuter&#146; as the Cook in Henry Carey's <span class="italic">Chrononhotonthologos</span>, but, according to a memorial notice in the <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> (November 1776), it is likely that he continued his tavern life by working as a &#145;billiard marker&#146;.<br>
<br>Shuter first appeared at Covent Garden Theatre for Chapman's benefit on 15 April 1745&#151;billed as one who had &#145;never appeared on the stage before&#146;&#151;playing the title role in the afterpiece <span class="italic">The Schoolboy</span>, by Colley Cibber. On 13 June 1746 Chapman played Laertes to David Garrick's Hamlet with Shuter taking the part of Osric. He concluded the season at Covent Garden on 27 June by appearing as one of the witches to Garrick's Macbeth before accompanying Chapman for the summer to Richmond. He played a recruit in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, Daniel in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>, Clencher in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>, and Gage in John Crowne's <span class="italic">Sir Courtly Nice</span>, and was given two benefit nights, one in Richmond and one in Twickenham. Shuter spent the 1746&#150;7 season at the illegal Goodman's Fields Theatre, where he began in earnest to compile his portfolio of roles. Among thirty which he played were Sir Jasper in Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">The Mock Doctor</span>, Taylor in John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>, Filch in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, Syringe in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>, Dr Caius in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Brazen in <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, Flash and Fribble in Garrick's <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span>, and Polonius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>.<br>
<br>When Goodman's Fields was closed down after the 1746&#150;7 season Shuter joined Samuel Foote in his attempt to evade the 1737 <span class="roman">Stage Licensing Act</span>. Foote hired the Haymarket Theatre and offered, for 2 April 1747, &#145;a Concert of Music. With which will be given Gratis a New Entertainment, call'd &#147;The Diversions of a Morning&#148;&#146;. Foote's ruse failed to deceive, and Shuter returned to Richmond.<br>
<br>Shuter's comic skills must have pleased Garrick, who engaged him when he took over Drury Lane Theatre in 1747. Shuter played there until 1753 (with an unexplained absence during 1748&#150;9) and spent his summers at Richmond and Twickenham. Garrick's prompter, Richard Cross, notes both his rising popularity as a comic actor and also his developing reputation for exchanging comment with his audience. He notes that, when Shuter played Perriwinkle in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">A Bold Stroke for a Wife</span>:<blockquote>At y<sup>e</sup> end of y<sup>e</sup> play, a voice call'd out to Shuter; Perriwinkle&#151;which he answer'd&#151;what do you want? This set y<sup>e</sup> audience in such a roar, that they insisted upon his giving out y<sup>e</sup> play, w<sup>ch</sup> he did with great Applause, this w<sup>ch</sup> would have been call'd Impudence in another was look'd upon, in him, as Humour; so rising is he in opinion. (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>)</blockquote>At Covent Garden the manager, John Rich, had developed a reputation for spectacle, music, and pantomime, and Shuter's popularity in these areas caused his move to the theatre in 1753&#150;4. With the exception of occasional benefit performances at Drury Lane, he remained at Covent Garden for the winter seasons until his last performance during 1775&#150;6. But, like most actors of the eighteenth century, he spent the summer months in the provinces. He was in Dublin and Cork for the summer of 1760 and during 1762 he returned to Richmond. In 1763 he appeared again in Dublin and in Norwich. The Haymarket Theatre now enjoyed a summer licence, and Shuter appeared there during 1765, 1766, and 1767. He was at Bristol in 1768 and again in 1769. By the early 1770s his reputation for farce and audience involvement made him an attractive &#145;guest&#146; playing his favourite parts on many of the provincial touring circuits. In this way he visited Edinburgh in 1773, then joined Tate Wilkinson's company based at York and Charles Mate's company at Canterbury. He made his last provincial foray in 1775 to Liverpool and York.<br>
<br>Shuter's comic and ribald talents also drew him to the entertainment booths of Southwark and Bartholomew fairs. In September 1757 he advertised: &#145;This day at noon, Mr Yates of Drury Lane and Mr Shuter of Covent Garden Theatres at the new erected Great Concert Hall, the Greyhound Inn, Smithfield, intend to divert the Town &hellip; with a variety of Entertainments&#146;. The <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> for 3 September 1757 states: &#145;the bold Shuter&#146; would &#145;review his Troop &hellip; attended by Mammamawks, Papapawks, and Tomahawks &hellip; The Lords may laugh, the Ladies may laugh, and the Commoners may laugh &hellip; and that will make me laugh&#146;. Shuter continued to present at fairs in 1760 and 1761, offering to give &#145;a new Exhilaration to Mirth, and dilate the Sides of Laughter, make Vice bleed under corrective Lash, and give a Lecture that shall Stimulate Virtue to pursue the Road to Happiness&#146;.<br>
<br>Shuter played a range of parts, all following distinctive &#145;lines&#146; of business&#151;farcical servants, country boys, ageing squires, old beaux, comical judges, and assorted eccentrics, including burlesque women's parts. Typical of his range are Old Sly in Cibber's <span class="italic">Love's Last Shift</span>, Clincher Junior in <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>, Sir Amourous La Foole in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Epicoene, or, The Silent Woman</span>, Sir Callaghan O'Brallaghan in Charles Macklin's <span class="italic">Love &agrave; la Mode</span>, and Lady Pentweazle in Foote's <span class="italic">Taste</span>. His Shakespearian roles included Dogberry in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, Touchstone in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, Feste in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, Stephano in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, and, probably his most remembered role, Falstaff in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>. Shuter should be remembered for giving the first performances in two of the century's great plays: Hardcastle in Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, on 15 March 1773, and Sir Anthony Absolute in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, on 17 January 1775. His final performance, as Falstaff, was for his benefit at Covent Garden on 10 May 1776. He returned for Mrs Gardiner's benefit to perform Scrub and to speak the epilogue from the back of a donkey on 23 September 1776.<br>
<br>Shuter's lack of education, his indolence, and his contractual carelessness, coupled with a predilection for hot gin, reduced his performing capacity and led to dissolution and illness. The actor John Moody wrote to Garrick from Liverpool in the summer of 1775: &#145;Shuter is a deplorable object! &hellip; He is profligate and wicked; he has been but once on the stage these last six weeks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1026). But William Parsons was unstinting in his praise: &#145;to see Corbachio [in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span>] acted to perfection, you should have seen Shuter; the public are pleased to think that I act the part well, but his acting was as far superior to mine, as Mount Vesuvius is to a rushlight&#146;  (Kelly, 159). His unpredictability was loved, and he clearly represented that vein of comic observation and easy delivery that his theatre admired. Francis Gentleman, in <span class="italic">The Dramatic Censor</span> (1770), describes his Harry Sycamore in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mill</span> (1765) as &#145;a talkative, vain, ignorant baronet, well calculated for Mr SHUTER, who exhibits him with whimsical pleasantry&#146;; however, &#145;he seems too sensible of his own humour, and palpably chuckles where he should leave that totally to the audience&#146;. He warns Shuter of a:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">swift-approaching age,<br>
</div>
<div>When lost to action, he must quit the stage &hellip; Avert the storm, in time; lay by some pence;<br>
</div>
<div>They'll yield thee comfort, and proclaim thy sense.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Doran's summary is revealing and credible:<blockquote>his life was one of intense professional labour, with much jollification, thoughtlessness, embarrassment, gay philosophy, hard drinking, and addiction to religion, as it was expounded by Whitfield. &hellip; Of all the frequenters of Whitfield's tabernacle in Tottenham Court road, there was no more liberal giver than the shattered, trembling, laughing, hoping, fearing, despairing&#151;in short, much perplexed actor and man who oscillated between Covent Garden stage and the Tabernacle pulpit, and meditated over his pipe and bottle in Drury Lane upon the infinite varieties of life. (Doran and Lowe, 2.335&#150;6)</blockquote>He had never married, but from about 1758 he engaged in a widely reported liaison with the dancer Nancy Dawson (1730?&#150;1767). Shuter died at his lodgings in Windmill Street on 1 November 1776 and was buried five days later in St Paul's, Covent Garden, leaving, as far as is known, no will.<br>
