<span class="headword">Heath,  Adrian Lewis Ross</span>  (1920&#150;1992), <span class="occ">artist and art teacher</span>, was born on 23 June 1920 at Matmyo, north Burma, the only child of Percy Charles Petgrave Heath, the manager of a rubber plantation for the Bombay Burma Corporation, and his wife, Adria Frederica Ross-Porter. In 1925 Heath was sent from Burma to England to live with his maternal grandmother at Marchwood Park, near Southampton, and in 1929 he became a boarder at Port Regis preparatory school, near Broadstairs in Kent. After this he attended Bryanston School, where he distinguished himself as a sportsman (athletics and cricket) but was disruptive in the classroom. At Bryanston, Heath became more seriously interested in art, but his instruction and exposure to the realities of painting were haphazard, resulting on the one hand in work that was &#145;very conservative &hellip; timid&#146;, and on the other in a real enjoyment of the &#145;deft &hellip; brio and brushstroke&#146; handling of paint by Edwardian artists, especially John Singer Sargent  (National Life Story Collection).<br>
<br>Heath left Bryanston in 1938 for Newlyn, Cornwall, to study the rudiments of painting with Alexander Stanhope Forbes, and in 1939 entered the Slade School of Fine Art, accompanying the school on its evacuation to Oxford in 1940. An attempt to enlist in the army was rebuffed, but in 1941 Heath was accepted by the RAF. Sidestepping the possibility and responsibilities of a commission, he eventually became a sergeant gunner, flying with 101 squadron. On a cross-channel sortie in January 1942 Heath's aircraft suffered engine failure: it made a forced landing near the Dutch coast, and Heath was captured. In Stalag 383 near Munich he met Terry Frost, whom he taught to draw and paint by passing on Forbes's basic methods of instruction. Heath became a persistent escaper, and was eventually banished to the isolation of a Silesian Stalag, where he remained until 1945, using his artistic skills as a forger of false papers for other escapers.<br>
<br>After repatriation Heath returned to the Slade. He graduated in 1947, travelled to Paris, and spent a year disengaging from the influence of C&eacute;zanne and moving towards the pure abstraction of younger French artists like Serge Poliakoff; his first solo exhibition was held in Carcassonne in 1948. Heath visited Frost in St Ives in 1947, and again in 1951 (when he met Ben Nicholson) but neither event seems to have been crucial to his developing career. Arguably, and unusually, his part-time work as a lecturer in art history (1949&#150;59) at the City Literary Institute, the Hammersmith School of Art, and the Regent Street Polytechnic was just as important. It paid the rent, and Heath freely acknowledged the resulting improvement in his own knowledge and understanding of art. In the same decade his twin careers as artist and teacher of artists gained momentum and began to overlap. Seeking to achieve complete abstraction in his painting, Heath initially inclined towards the &#145;systems&#146; art (he called it &#145;dynamic symmetry&#146;) then being made by Victor Pasmore, Kenneth Martin, and Anthony Hill. However, in time their focus on mathematical precision became a constraint: Heath veered away from such austere practice, preferring to work intuitively and completely constructively, with what he called &#145;muck materials&#146; like Polyfilla or cement.<br>
<br>In 1953 Heath began a lifelong association with the Redfern Gallery in London as a regular solo exhibitor and published a rewarding and thought-provoking book, <span class="italic">Abstract Art: its Origin and Meaning</span>. On 17 July 1952 Heath married Corinne Elizabeth Reid Lloyd (<i>b</i>. 1922/3), a designer, daughter of Charles Jesse Lloyd, banker. The newly-weds lived at Heath's house at 22 Fitzroy Street, London, before moving in 1957 to 28 Charlotte Street; they had a son and a daughter. In 1956 Heath was a participant in the important exhibition <span class="italic">This is Tomorrow</span> at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, and in 1959 he began to exhibit outside London, at venues in Britain and northern Europe, in solo shows or in small, mixed, or group exhibitions of drawing or painting. In later years he travelled widely, drawing single-point motifs in Spain, Morocco, Norway, and Sweden, and &#145;the barren quality&#146; of the landscape around his own Hebridean croft. These experiences fed an articulate process of painterly self-questioning, and a panoramic intellect developed from hungry and catholic reading.<br>
<br>Heath never denied the many &#145;happy accidents&#146; that can befall an abstract artist, an openness that helped to establish his charisma as a part-time tutor at the Bath Academy of Art, at Corsham Court (1955&#150;76) alongside Peter Lanyon, Howard Hodgkin, Ayres, and others; and as senior fellow at Cardiff Polytechnic Institute of Higher Education (1977&#150;88). His chairmanship of the Allied Artists' Association (1954&#150;64) and his service with the Arts Council's art panel (1964&#150;71) were marked by his disarming ability to facilitate, and not to dictate; but perhaps his greatest, unsung service to British art lay in his work during the 1970s and 1980s as standards moderator and troubleshooter for the Council for National Academic Awards. Through his determined promotion of the highest tutorial and academic standards in art education he helped to move British art education forward. Still painting, Heath died in France on 15 September 1992.<br>
