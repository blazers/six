<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Conolly,  Thomas</span>  (1738&#150;1803), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born probably in Castletown, co. Kildare, Ireland, the second son of William James Conolly (<i>d</i>. 1754), MP for Ballyshannon from 1727 until his death in 1753, and Lady Anne Wentworth (<i>d</i>. 1797), eldest daughter of Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford of the second creation. The fortunes of the Conolly family in Ireland had been founded by William Conolly (1662&#150;1729), speaker of the Irish House of Commons. He left all his property to his nephew, Thomas Conolly's father. Thomas had seven sisters, Catherine, wife of Ralph Gore, earl of Rosse; Annie, who married George Byng, of Torrington; Harriet, who married John Staples; Frances, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13966/', "William Howe, fifth Viscount Howe")</script>; Caroline, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13394/', "John Hobart, second earl of Buckinghamshire")</script>; Lucy; and Jane, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9551/', "George Robert Fitzgerald")</script>. Conolly had an elder brother, William (<i>bap</i>. 5 December 1734) who died in childhood.<br>
<br>After schooling at Westminster (1750&#150;54), Conolly married on 30 December 1758 Louisa Augusta Lennox [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48895/', "Conolly, Lady Louisa Augusta (1743&#150;1821)")</script>], third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16450/', "Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond (1701&#150;1750)")</script>, and his wife, Sarah Cadogan (<i>d</i>. 1751). She was the sister of Emily, duchess of Leinster, and Caroline Fox, Lady Holland. In 1759 Conolly was elected MP for Malmesbury in the British House of Commons, and in 1761 for Ballyshannon and for Londonderry County in the Irish House of Commons. He chose to sit for Londonderry, which seat he held until May 1800, resigning just before the union. He showed little ability in either house, but from his wealth and connections possessed influence in Ireland, where he was governor of the city and county of Londonderry from 1761 (jointly with Henry, Earl Conyngham, until 1781) and where he was sworn of the privy council in 1761. After sitting for Malmesbury until 1768, and for Chichester, through the influence of his father-in-law, from 1768 to 1780, in the British House of Commons, he gave up his seat in that house, and took up residence permanently at Castletown.<br>
<br>Conolly declared himself to be a whig, but his whiggism was frequently put to the test. In 1774 the Presbyterians of co. Londonderry, including his tenants at Newtownlimavady, were incensed by his support of the <span class="roman">Vestry Act</span>, and threatened to oppose him in the 1776 election with an independent candidate. Conolly came to terms with the dissenters. The independent withdrew and he was re-elected for the county of Londonderry. In 1775 he had embraced the cause of the American colonists, but he remained ambivalent towards the Irish volunteer movement, supporting its reform programme in general but becoming nervous when it seemed to impinge on the interests of the Irish aristocracy. In 1789 he was prominent in the revolt of the Irish House of Commons against the ministry during the regency crisis and was one of the members deputed to offer the prince of Wales the regency without any restriction whatever. He was one of the ten chief persons in Ireland to whom Cornwallis broached the first idea of a legislative union with England in 1798. Cornwallis, in his dispatch of 27 November 1798, wrote that he had consulted seven leading peers, the attorney- and solicitor-general, and Conolly on the subject, and that &#145;Mr. Conolly had always been a decided friend to an union, and was ready to give it his best assistance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Charles, First Marquis Cornwallis</span>, ed. C. Ross, 1859, 2.450). Conolly threw himself warmly into the debates on the question, doubtless under the influence of the chief secretary for Ireland, Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, who had married his niece Lady Amelia Anne Hobart, and several times spoke in favour of the measure, which, however, extinguished his own political importance.<br>
<br>On the passing of the union Conolly decided to abandon politics, for, though he might easily have been returned for Londonderry to the united parliament, he preferred to hand over the seat to Colonel Charles Stewart, Castlereagh's half-brother. He retired to Castletown in 1800, where he began to suffer acute depression, partly a reaction to the events of the rebellion of 1798 and to a lawsuit with his sisters and Lord Howe, the executors of his mother's will, over settlements due to them out of his English estates. He left Castletown in the summer of 1801 and spent some time in Brighton and London in an attempt to recover his health. He died on 27 April 1803 at Castletown, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his great-nephew, Edward Michael Conolly Pakenham, who inherited the estates in Ireland and Castletown. His widow, Lady Louisa Conolly, lived until 1821, and helped to educate her nephews, the children of her sister Lady Sarah Napier, who resided near Castletown.<br>
<br>Although his inheritance made Conolly the richest man in Ireland and the most influential in parliamentary terms, he never used these advantages effectively in politics. Almost alone among the great figures of the protestant ascendancy, he ended his life without a peerage, preferring to be respected as &#145;Squire Conolly&#146;, a conscientious landlord and master of foxhounds. He reformed the financial affairs of his estates, and spent &pound;25,000 on improvements at Castletown. Jonah Barrington, in his <span class="italic">Historic Anecdotes</span>, devoted some pages to Conolly, in which he criticized his attitude to the union rather unfavourably, and thus analysed the causes of his influence:<blockquote>Mr. Conolly had the largest connection of any individual in the commons house. He fancied he was a whig because he was not professedly a tory; bad as a statesman, worse as an orator, he was as a sportsman pre-eminent. &hellip; He was nearly allied to the Irish minister [Castlereagh] at the time of the discussion of the union, and he followed his lordship's fortune, surrendered his country, lost his own importance, died in comparative obscurity, and in his person ended the pedigree of one of the most respectable English families ever resident in Ireland. (Barrington, 265&#150;7)</blockquote>
