<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anderson, Sir  John</span>  (1858&#150;1918), <span class="occ">civil servant and colonial governor</span>, was born on 23 January 1858 at the Free School, Gartly, Aberdeenshire, the only son among the five children of John Anderson, schoolmaster and later superintendent of the Gordon Mission, Aberdeen, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smart. He was educated at Old Aberdeen grammar school and Aberdeen University, where he graduated in 1877 with a first-class honours degree in mathematics and a gold medal as the best student of his year. In 1879 he came top in the open civil service examination and entered the Colonial Office and he moved his home, for the rest of his life, to London. On 26 June 1879 he married the 26-year-old Georgina Milne Daniel, daughter of James Daniel, master printer, of Aberdeen. They had four sons and two daughters, but the marriage was later clouded by his wife's permanent ill health.<br>
<br>While still working at the Colonial Office Anderson enrolled as a student of Gray's Inn and won a Bacon scholarship in 1887 and an inns of court studentship in 1888. Though he was not called to the bar his legal expertise was impressive. He became private secretary to the permanent under-secretary, Sir Robert Meade, in 1892, and special assignments took him to Paris and to Gibraltar. He was promoted first-class clerk in 1896 and principal clerk in 1897, and in the latter year served as secretary to the conference of colonial premiers convened by Joseph Chamberlain, the secretary of state for the colonies. In 1898 he became CMG and in 1901 he was knighted KCMG and went with the future George V on a visit to Australia by way of the Far East. At Singapore Frank Swettenham, then governor, was late in meeting the royal party at the dockside, the start of an enduring antipathy between him and Anderson. In 1902 Anderson again acted as secretary to the colonial conference convened by Chamberlain.<br>
<br>In 1904 Anderson succeeded Swettenham in the governorship of the Straits Settlements (bringing his elder daughter with him to deputize as governor's lady). He showed himself a forceful governor, &#145;proceeding <i>fortiter in re</i> but hardly <i>suaviter in modo</i>&#146; according to one of his officials  (Macfadyen, 53). In choosing a new head of the Federated Malay States government he passed over two of Swettenham's lieutenants, who soon afterwards became governors elsewhere, and appointed William Taylor, whose previous service as government auditor in Ceylon inclined him to say no to everything. This unfortunate choice ended in 1910 with Taylor's displacement when even Anderson had had enough. When he sought to retire Ernest Birch, the senior resident, the Colonial Office in effect told both men that they must work together&#151;and they did. In the Straits Settlements towns Anderson stiffened sanitary regulations on building despite opposition by property owners, and he solved the longstanding instability of bimetallism by fixing the value of the local (silver) dollar in a ratio to that of the gold sovereign that lasted for half a century. He brought into public ownership an important part of the Singapore docks, to overcome neglect, and he also set up a specialist customs and excise service to replace some inadequate expedients. The local business community frustrated his plans to introduce a local income tax in substitution for government revenue from opium. The local Chinese community was disturbed by events in China leading to the revolution of 1911, but the Colonial Office ignored Anderson's plan for a new honour to recognize loyal public service in the colony. In the Federated Malay States he established in 1909 a federal legislative council at which the business community could express its views, but hardly addressed the problem of over-centralization that would complicate the situation for years to come. Further north, Siam reluctantly ceded to Britain its suzerainty over four Malay states and in 1909 Anderson assumed responsibility as high commissioner, showing good judgement in dealing with Malay rulers who resented being, as one of them said, bought and sold like a buffalo. He was also high commissioner for the state of Brunei from 1906. Promotion to GCMG in 1909 recognized his achievements and it was intended that he should extend his term to 1912 to oversee the changes he had made. But in 1911 he was recalled to become permanent under-secretary at the Colonial Office, a post he held until 1915. He was made KCB in 1913.<br>
<br>At the end of 1915 Anderson was again sent overseas as governor of Ceylon, where his predecessor, Sir Robert Chalmers, had over-reacted to riots by declaring a state of martial law. In dealing with the demands of the Sinhalese professional class he was more conciliatory than local European opinion, official and unofficial, deemed appropriate in time of war. He was preparing proposals for the Colonial Office when his death on 24 March 1918, at the hill station of Nuwara Eliya, supervened. &#145;British officialdom buried him with maimed rites&#146;  (Ludowyk, 240) at Colombo, but the Sinhalese planned to raise a fund for educational purposes in his memory. As a governor of the Straits Settlements and then of Ceylon, Anderson's firmness had occasionally hardened into rigidity, and his judgement and treatment of men was not infallible. Of medium build, in appearance he was grave and austere, and nervousness made him a poor public speaker. His ability and integrity earned him respect rather than affection, but he achieved a great deal.<br>
