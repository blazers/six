<span class="headword">Clarke,  Thomas</span>  (1884&#150;1957), <span class="occ">journalist and broadcaster</span>, was born at 39 High Street, Bolton, on 6 June 1884, the youngest child of five sons and three daughters of Joseph Clarke, a Lancashire-born Irish cotton spinner, and later an insurance salesman, and his wife, Martha Marsh, a Baptist. Clarke attended Clarence Street higher grade school, forerunner of Bolton grammar school, and contributed to Bolton's newspaper, the <span class="italic">Northern Weekly</span>. Encouraged by his mother and by his eldest brother, the journalist Charles Allen Clarke (1863&#150;1935), he applied to Ruskin Hall where he won a scholarship, going up to Oxford in May 1902, just before his eighteenth birthday. At Ruskin, Dennis Hird guided and inspired his intellectual zest. Following his study in Oxford, he worked on the <span class="italic">Lewisham Journal</span>, at &pound;1 a week, where his editor, Frederick George Kellaway, remarked that, after a year, Clarke had learned all he needed to know of journalism and urged him to travel abroad.<br>
<br>So at the age of nineteen Clarke went in 1903 to Hong Kong to work on the <span class="italic">South China Morning Post</span>, and found himself involved in some world shaking events in the Far East. He served as correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> and the <span class="italic">Chicago Tribune</span> in French Indo-China and, at the end of the Russo-Japanese War, visited China, Japan, Korea, and Russia, including Siberia. On his return to London the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> informed him that living in the Far East had put him out of touch with events in Britain and Europe and he retreated to Manchester where Henry Marriott Richardson, literary editor of the Manchester <span class="italic">Evening Chronicle</span> (later general secretary of the National Union of Journalists), offered him a post at &pound;2 5<i>s</i>. a week. A story about a flying meeting at Blackpool resulted in James Heddle, editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> (established in 1908 and printed in Manchester), offering him the position of London news editor at &pound;5 a week. This was 1909 and on 1 June 1910 Clarke married his first wife, Elizabeth Naylor Waddington (1887/8&#150;1957), the only daughter of Richard Waddington JP, schoolmaster and educational publisher, of Bolton.<br>
<br>In 1911 Clarke joined the foreign news desk of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, serving as night news editor from 1914 until December 1916, when he joined the army, where &#145;as a signals officer in the Army I &hellip; developed a keen personal interest in wireless&#146; broadcasting  (Clarke, <span class="italic">My Northcliffe Diary</span>). He rejoined the <span class="italic">Mail</span> in 1919 when Alfred, Viscount Northcliffe appointed him news editor of the <span class="italic">Mail</span>, and dispatched him on a tour of the United States and Canada to study newspaper production. He relished foreign travel, visiting Northcliffe in various European resorts frequented by the wealthy and famous, and became an ardent skiing enthusiast.<br>
<br>Clarke kept a diary and studied Northcliffe's methods and character, and later published two books on him which reveal much about Northcliffe's working methods and place in modern journalism, but provide little analysis of his political influence and are more hagiography than biography.<br>
<br>On 15 June 1920 Clarke secured the first musical broadcast on wireless by arranging for Nellie Melba to sing excerpts from <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span> from the Marconi factory at Chelmsford&#151;a broadcast which was heard around the world. In the following November, 1920, the American <span class="italic">Wireless Age</span> published a two-page interview with Clarke on this &#145;epochal achievement belonging to the other side of the Atlantic&#146;.<br>
<br>After Northcliffe's death in 1922, Clarke accepted the invitation of Keith Murdoch to become assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Melbourne Herald</span>; he lived in Australia with his family from 1923 to 1926, and related some of his experiences in his book <span class="italic">Marriage at 6 a.m.</span> (1934). Then he made what he later regarded as the biggest mistake of his career, and became managing editor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in July 1926&#151;and editor, as well as a member of the board of directors, when it merged with its rival the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> in 1930 to become the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. Under his influence the paper's circulation rose above one million, and he revolutionized its format to compete with other national newspapers&#151;so much so that Lord Beaverbrook several times tempted him to become editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, but Clarke felt he had to honour his contract. However, the political problems surrounding the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, not least having to contend with three boards of directors caused by amalgamating the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, and the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, forced him to resign in October 1933. A year later he worked, briefly, in Finland on <span class="italic">Berlingske Tidende</span>, before returning to the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> to cover the Australian cricket tour of England in 1934.<br>
<br>Clarke's appointment as director of practical journalism for London University's diploma of journalism (really Britain's first professor of journalism), in 1935, was celebrated by a public luncheon in his honour. He had previously lectured at the university while news editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> and served on the university's journalism committee from 1925. In his new position he revolutionized the course. He ensured that it was centred in King's College, and added practical reporting assignments, ably organized by his assistant and former student Joan Skipsey, at the lawcourts, local government offices, the Port of London Authority, Selfridges, train and travel companies, and so on. These had to be of a prescribed length and submitted before a deadline. Together with the academic tutor to journalism students, the well-known editor of the Penguin Shakespeare books, George Bagshawe Harrison, Clarke modernized the syllabus so that students were taught the background to the modern world. Although the course closed in 1939, never to be re-established, Clarke's legacy to British journalism continued through the 1980s when Geoffrey Pinnington, the Harmsworth gold medallist in journalism for 1939, became the editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday People</span>. Clarke condensed his lecture notes, now in the Senate House Library, London University, to publish a textbook, <span class="italic">Journalism</span> (1947).<br>
<br>In summer 1936 Clarke toured the world with his daughter Patricia, as his wife was by then incapacitated by the mental illness which affected her until her death. One result of the tour was the publication of <span class="italic">Round the World with Tom Clarke</span> (1937). About this time Clarke began an affair with Sheila Irene Emily Castle, then wife of Edward Cyril Castle, a journalist and later Lord Castle of Islington. The daughter of Harry Samuel Green, a coastguard officer, she took Clarke's name by deed poll at the birth of their daughter, Judith, although they did not marry until 1952, by which time he had divorced his first wife. At the outbreak of war Clarke became deputy director of the news division of the Ministry of Information, but he left in 1940, allegedly because of his wife's illness, and most probably to find her suitable care in residential accommodation.<br>
<br>During 1941 Clarke joined Edward Hulton in establishing a chain of specialized news agencies, with a parent company under the title of Britanova, and he sailed from Liverpool in September to establish its operations in Rio de Janeiro. Ostensibly a private venture, the company was secretly subsidized by the Foreign Office to counteract German propaganda south of Panama. This operation lasted only a year and resulted in another book, <span class="italic">The Word of an Englishman</span> (1943), in which Clarke revealed his interest in the writings of William Henry Hudson. He continued with the news agency, but inaugurated a weekly newsletter from London in the BBC South American service which lasted from 1942 to 1948. Clarke suffered his first heart attack in August 1945 immediately after reading his <span class="italic">Letter from London</span> and a second attack in April 1948 while attending a cattle show in Berkshire. Although the BBC offered to send a mobile studio to record his talks at his Surrey home in Honeysuckle Bottom, East Horsley, Clarke retired from broadcasting but, never one to miss an opportunity, he published <span class="italic">Living Happily with a &#145;Heart&#146;</span> (1954).<br>
<br>Clarke had a brisk manner, friendly brown eyes, very dark hair which he kept all his life, and what a friend described as a Lancashire-Irish glow. He maintained his friendships over decades and on his travels met many people with whom he had worked in earlier days. Perhaps his friendship with F. G. Kellaway, later a member of parliament and postmaster-general and a director of Marconi, motivated Clarke's pioneering approach to wireless broadcasting.<br>
<br>Clarke reveals most about himself in his book <span class="italic">Brian</span>, written in 1936, five years after his youngest son died of meningitis aged nine. Clarke died at 19 Lexden Road, Colchester, on 18 June 1957, survived by his two wives and two daughters, and an American granddaughter. His two sons predeceased him.<br>
