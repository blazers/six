<span class="headword">Peirson,  Francis</span>  (1757&#150;1781), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in early January 1757, the eldest son of Francis Peirson of Mowthorpe Grange in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He was educated at Warrington Academy before entering the army, at the age of fifteen, on 16 July 1772. He rose to the rank of major in August 1779, when he was appointed to the 95th regiment, which in June 1780 sailed for Jersey. At this period the Channel Islands were subjected to the constant danger of attacks from the French, who made several unsuccessful attempts to gain possession. By far the most important of these raids was that of 6 January 1781, known as the battle of Jersey, when the French, under the baron de Rullecourt, landed under cover of night and took possession of the town of St Helier, making the lieutenant-governor, Major Moses Corbet, a prisoner in his bed. Under these circumstances, the colonel and lieutenant-colonel being absent from the island, command of the troops devolved upon the youthful Peirson. Rullecourt succeeded in inducing Corbet to sign a capitulation, and the island's Elizabeth Castle was summoned to surrender, but the officer in command refused to obey the order. Meanwhile the regular troops and the island militia, under the command of Major Peirson, advanced in two divisions towards St Helier's Royal Square, then the market place, where a vigorous engagement took place, resulting in heavy French casualties. Peirson's victory was complete but was gained at a heavy price, for at the moment of victory he was shot through the heart and fell dead in the arms of his grenadiers. Rullecourt himself was mortally wounded, and most of the French soldiers were taken prisoner. Peirson, who was then just twenty-four, was interred on 10 January in the parish church of St Helier with all the honours of war and in the presence of the states of the island, who erected a monument to his memory. The government provided Peirson's father with a pension of &pound;250 per annum, while smaller sums were granted to his three remaining sisters. His gallantry was the subject of John Singleton Copley's painting <span class="italic">The Death of Major Peirson</span> and was commemorated by the naming of Peirson Place in St Helier.<br>
