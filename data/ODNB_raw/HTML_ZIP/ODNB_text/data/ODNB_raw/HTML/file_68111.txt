<span class="headword">Willes,  Edward</span>  (1704&#150;1768), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the only son of Edward Willes of Newbold Comyn, Leamington, Warwickshire, and his wife, Bridget Murcott of Cubington, Warwickshire. Though descended from &#145;an antient gentleman's family&#146;  (Willes papers, &#145;Apology for my own circumstances&#146;, 1) the Willes' family income from land was insufficient to enable them to sustain a gentry lifestyle with any comfort. Edward's grandfather Peter Willes (<i>d</i>. 1656), &#145;an attorney of the greatest eminence in the middle of England &hellip; was reputed very rich&#146;  (ibid.) but Edward's father inherited only debts. Moreover, he was not of &#145;a method of creating a fortune&#146; with the result that it was determined that Edward should &#145;go to the university to be either a physician or a lawyer&#146;  (ibid., 2). He was admitted as a pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, on 24 August 1719. Two years later, on the advice of his cousin Edward Willes, then an ambitious young king's counsel who offered &#145;his patronage and protection&#146;  (ibid., 3), Edward entered Lincoln's Inn, without having graduated from Cambridge, and in 1727 he was called to the bar.<br>
<br>Though Willes's primary motive was to secure a lucrative position that would allow him to repay family debts which, on his father's death, amounted to &pound;5000 (his income when his obligations to his mother, sister, and half-sister were deducted was only &pound;200 per annum), he made slow progress. His marriage to Mary Denny of Norfolk eased his financial problems somewhat but it was essential that he should succeed at the law if he was to avoid the indignity of selling the family estate. Having commenced on the midland circuit he also appeared for a time at Chester, while his cousin was a judge there. Having been made a serjeant-at-law in 1740 and a king's counsel in 1745, he appeared as attorney-general for the duchy of Lancaster and recorder at Coventry until, by the early 1750s, he was &#145;the first man in business in the Midland Circuit&#146;  (Willes papers, &#145;Apology for my own circumstances&#146;). Advised that a position on the judicial bench in Ireland would be more &#145;preferable in all respects to what &hellip; you must &hellip; be &hellip; appointed to&#146; in England, and promoted by his cousin, who was now chief justice of the common pleas, he accepted the position of chief baron of the Irish court of exchequer when it fell vacant in 1757  (Willes papers, Brooke to Willes, 7 Sept 1757).<br>
<br>Though he joined other judges of English origin Willes had a difficult introduction to the Irish bench. His problems derived in the main from the decision of the Irish chancellor of the exchequer, Anthony Malone, to assert a right, which his predecessors had declined, to sit &#145;on the bench in all equity cases as the head of the court&#146;  (BL, Hardwicke MSS, Add. MS 35595, fol. 214). Overshadowed by the ebullient and talented chancellor, it was not until Malone was induced, by the failure of his banking ventures in 1758, to curtail his judicial activities that Willes was enabled to demonstrate the diligence and integrity that were the hallmarks of his judicial career in Ireland. These qualities were displayed particularly vividly when he was on circuit, as he did his utmost &#145;to acquaint the people (many of whom know little of government but what they see at the assizes) of the nature of laws and the necessity there is for the public good to enforce obedience to them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 29). It was on circuit too that he made most of the observations he recorded in the valuable epistolary description of Ireland that he relayed between 1757 and 1762 to his friend and patron, the earl of Warwick. These constitute the best-known part of his surviving papers, but he also penned a number of other narratives that, as well as providing important insights into the operations of law and government, indicate that when obliged in his capacity as privy councillor to make political decisions Willes was guided by what best served the interests of the British government in Ireland and the protestant religion.<br>
<br>In 1766 ill health compelled Willes to resign his judgeship. He returned to England with an annual pension of &pound;1000, a host of friends, and fond memories of nine years that were financially as well as professionally the most satisfying of his life. He died at Newbold Comyn in 1768, and was survived by his wife.<br>
