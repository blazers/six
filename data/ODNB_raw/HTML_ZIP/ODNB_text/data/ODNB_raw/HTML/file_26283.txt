<span class="headword">Stanley, Sir  William</span>  (1548&#150;1630), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Rowland Stanley (<i>c</i>.1516&#150;1612) of Hooton and Storeton, Cheshire, head of the senior branch of the house of Stanley, and Margaret Aldersey. Aged twelve, at Christmas 1560 he married Ann Dutton of Hatton, a bride two years his junior; the union was dissolved in 1565. Records concerning the annulment state that Stanley was educated at the school of Dr Standish of Lathom and had also served in the household of his aristocratic relative Edward Stanley, third earl of Derby. It is probable that William was brought up adhering to the old religion, as his father, a justice of the peace and a former sheriff of Chester, was suspected of being a recusant in 1583. In the late 1560s Stanley pursued a military career, serving until 1570 with the duke of Alva during his coercive governorship of the Netherlands.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinIrelandandtheNetherlands"></a>Service in Ireland and the Netherlands</h2>On his return from the Low Countries Stanley went to Ireland and remained there for fifteen years. He came to prominence in the campaign of 1579 against the earl of Desmond. In recognition of the quality of his service Lord Justice Sir William Drury knighted Stanley at Waterford that year. Notable engagements included those at Youghal, Monasternenagh, and Adare. After a short visit to England Stanley was heavily involved in the suppression of Viscount Baltinglass's rebellion in Leinster in 1580. He wrote a vivid eyewitness account of the morale-sapping reverse suffered by ambushed crown forces in Glenmalure at the hands of Fiach Mac Hugh O'Byrne. His subsequent actions against local septs in Wicklow, especially the torching of Fiach Mac Hugh's house at Ballinacor and the slaughter of hundreds of Kavanaghs, earned him high praise from the Irish treasurer, Sir Henry Wallop, and the president of Connaught, Sir Nicholas Malby.<br>
<br>During another sojourn in England Stanley joined a syndicate run by Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Sir Thomas Gerrard which aimed to plant America with recusants, but he returned to Munster in early 1583 when the project lost momentum. The earl of Ormond, the new lord president of the province, then appointed him constable of Castlemaine and captain of the garrison at Lismore. It is certain that Stanley intended to settle in Munster. In a letter to Sir Francis Walsingham in May that year he wrote of his plans to make Castlemaine &#145;a town of English&#146; and he unsuccessfully sought lands adjoining the manor of Lismore  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1574&#150;88</i>, 432, 484). His troops played a crucial part in the mopping-up operations that brought the rebellion to a close, notably the pursuit and assassination of the earl of Desmond. In March 1584 he unsuccessfully petitioned Lord Burghley and Walsingham for the presidency of Connaught, vacant following Malby's death. Despite the failure of this suit he held other important offices in Ireland including the sheriffdom of Cork and the reversion of a commission as master of the ordnance. He was entrusted with politically sensitive positions such as keeper of the peace in Munster during the earl of Ormond's absence, and the pro-presidency of Munster while Lord Deputy Perrot's appointee, John Norris, served in Ulster.<br>
<br>Stanley's reputation for military prowess led to his removal to Antrim in early January 1585, by order of Lord Deputy Perrot, to stave off an invasion of redshanks under the leadership of Sorley Boy Mac Donnell. In this engagement his band was driven from its position near Ballycastle by a force of over 2000 Scots, and Stanley received three severe wounds, which put him out of service for much of the rest of the year. Even as late as June he had to have an arrowhead cut out of his back. In October he returned to England in order to have some lands conveyed to him by his father.<br>
<br>Following the suppression of the Munster rebellion and the subsequent partition of the Desmond estates it became obvious, for reasons both of financial prudence and political stability, that the province would have to be demilitarized. The earl of Leicester's campaign to defend the United Provinces of the Netherlands against Spain was seized upon as a convenient outlet for the redeployment of the queen's soldiers, especially those who were native Irishmen. In March 1586 Stanley, who had accompanied the earl on his initial Dutch foray the previous December, returned to Ireland to levy over 1000 troops. Stanley's exclusion from the lucrative Munster plantation left him little option but to continue his military career, despite his role in facilitating the preliminary survey of attainted lands.<br>
<br>By the time Stanley had brought his band to London to be transported to the Dutch wars, he was already being referred to as a Catholic subversive. Gilbert Gifford, a double agent posing as a priest, alleged to the exiled Spanish ambassador Mendoza that Stanley was aware of and complicit in the conspiracy associated with Anthony Babington that aimed to assassinate Elizabeth and enthrone Mary Stewart with the military assistance of Spain. In mid-August 1586 Mendoza expressed to Philip II his hopes that Stanley would use his regiment quartered in London to seize the queen's ships, a step that Philip himself described in his annotations to the memo as &#145;the most important thing of all&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1580&#150;86</i>, 603&#150;8). By the time Mendoza had written this, however, Stanley had already joined Leicester's forces in the Netherlands. From the very start he played a prominent role in Leicester's attempts to launch a renewed offensive, participating in the seizure of Doesborg and a pyrrhic assault on the heights overlooking the Spanish-held town of Zutphen. At this point the earl turned his attention to Deventer, the third most important mercantile centre in the Netherlands, which lay 5 miles from Zutphen. An anti-Spanish faction within the town was looking for an opportunity to hand Deventer over to the United Provinces.<br>
<br>On the night of 23 October 1586 Stanley's regiment entered Deventer, which had been left unguarded, in small groups. The town capitulated peacefully the following morning. The magistrates of the Spanish party were imprisoned and a new municipal government, made up of figures amenable to the English presence, was appointed in their place. Despite the protests of the states general, Leicester appointed Stanley governor of Deventer. Before his departure in mid-November the earl, demonstrating antipathy to his deputy Sir John Norris, granted separate commissions to Stanley and Rowland York, captain of the fort at Zutphen sconce. These exempted them from obedience to Norris. In his capacity as governor of the provinces, Leicester also forbade the Dutch council of state from putting aside any of his appointees to the government of towns or forts.<br>
<br>By December the burghers of Deventer were complaining to the council of state about Stanley's high-handedness as governor. They alleged that he had violently seized the keys of the city's gates, infringed their liberties, and, through his soldiers' constant menacing of the population and firm hold of all fortifications, kept the city in the grip of a reign of terror. It was further rumoured that Stanley's Irish troops were in league with Catholics within the walls to give the city over to the Spanish garrison at Zutphen. Stanley, however, described his conduct as the application of severe justice to ensure his men received victuals from the Dutch, who, he claimed, had a chronic tendency towards disobedience. His entire regiment, at this stage, was forced to live on &pound;3 a day. Matters came to a head on 18&#150;19 January 1587 when Stanley handed Deventer and the most part of his garrison over to Tassis, the Spanish governor of Zutphen. On the same day York gave his fort to the Spaniards. These actions nullified at a stroke the benefits accrued from Leicester's recent campaigning.<h2>
<a name="Spanishpartisan"></a>Spanish partisan</h2>In London the court identified Stanley and his regiment of defectors as a serious threat to English security. This alarm was accompanied by an intense feeling of betrayal, stemming from the high regard Stanley commanded as one of Elizabeth's most skilled military captains. Leicester stated that Elizabeth had been willing to entrust &#145;whole kingdoms&#146; to the traitor, an indication that Stanley may have been in line to become lord deputy of Ireland. Indeed, throughout the 1590s the privy council in London and the Irish council in Dublin feared that Stanley and his men, &#145;over well acquainted with the service and state of [Ireland]&#146;, might return and undermine England's hold on the country on Spain's behalf. Stanley himself stated that &#145;in Ireland [he would] open such a game of war as the Queen [had] never seen in her life&#146; (<span class="italic">Correspondentie</span>, ed. Brugmans, 2.86; <span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1586&#150;8</i>, 266; Bagwell, 3.162).<br>
<br>Stanley remained in place as governor of Deventer for a year. In this period he made the acquaintance of the English Catholic community in Flanders. He subsequently came into contact with Cardinal Allen, who in 1587 published an apologia for Stanley's actions aimed at inducing English soldiers to follow his example. Allen, using orthodox thinking on the just war, argued that Stanley ceded Deventer to the Spaniards because he believed it rightfully belonged to King Philip. Therefore England's war in the Netherlands was <i>ab initio</i> unjust, and any soldier participating in it on Elizabeth's side was guaranteed that his soul was in mortal sin. London countered with a pamphlet that accused both Allen and Stanley of bad faith, and asserted the justice of England's involvement in the conflict. Rumours also abounded that the English government sought to eliminate Stanley by poisoning. In 1589 he left the Netherlands and travelled to Spain, no doubt hoping to receive adulation and greater military responsibilities. But he received remarkably little favour in the Spanish court; indeed there are indications that the Spaniards held Stanley's defection to be unchivalric, despite the benefits that resulted from it. Philip II even refused to place his garrison under the direct assistance of the Spanish treasury, thereby making it hard for Stanley to recruit more troops.<br>
<br>Henceforth Stanley endeavoured to interest Philip in plans to intervene militarily in English affairs. But the Spanish king, despite Stanley's petitions, initially refused to give the regiment any specific project or campaign to engage in. By 1591 Stanley had received some support from Philip for his plan to seize Alderney as part of a post-Armada project to menace England and threaten Henri IV, France's new protestant king, from Flanders and the Channel Islands. But, despite England's intervention in Brittany in 1591 under Sir John Norris, financial constraints and a lack of will combined to make the Spanish council of war reluctant to endorse the enterprise.<br>
<br>On his return to Flanders in 1591 Stanley found his regiment in disarray and beset by internal tensions. The following year, forecasting further English intervention in Brittany, he suggested that England must be directly attacked as a counterbalance. But this proposal also received little support and Stanley remained with his regiment in the Low Countries. Another opportunity for active employment offered itself in spring 1597, when Philip II suggested to the Archduke Albert that Stanley might raid the English coast from Dunkirk with a fleet of seven ships. This plan, however, did not receive endorsement in Brussels. Subsequently the regiment's membership dwindled to such an extent that it was disbanded and its members distributed among other bands.<br>
<br>By this stage Stanley's intrigues against England had acquired a more overtly political character. Along with other English exiles, he endeavoured to establish a board in Flanders dealing with English affairs, which could become a court in exile centred around the infanta. The intention was that her claims to the English throne might be advanced, following Elizabeth's death, not by Spaniards but by Englishmen. In the case of a succession dispute Stanley hoped he might lead 3000 men in an attack on England to divert forces away from engaging a fresh Armada. Again these stratagems were put aside. In 1600 Stanley repaired once more to the Spanish court to try and influence the new king Philip III to support direct raids on England from a Flemish base, and also to collect the arrears on his salary. However, the catastrophic Irish enterprise, which foundered with the decisive English victory at Kinsale, was being pursued at the time. In December 1602 the Archduke Albert's council of war unambiguously and finally rejected Stanley's invasion plans, but admitted him to their company, effectively ending his active soldiering career.<br>
<br>Following the accession of James I, the treaty of London made all Stanley's plans for harrying England obsolete. Nevertheless, following the Gunpowder Plot he was accused by his former standard-bearer Guy Fawkes of continuing to harbour designs to invade England. To placate the English king Stanley was arrested in Brussels. Within a year he was freed, exonerated from all charges, and excluded from the subsequent act of attainder decreed against the conspirators. His return to favour in Flanders was signalled when the archduke sent him to Spain with news of the clandestine alliance between James I and the Dutch estates. During James's reign Stanley seems to have settled into the role of governor of Mechelen and turned to religious matters, becoming a key figure in the foundation of the Jesuit novitiate in Li&egrave;ge. At this time his second wife, Elizabeth Egerton (<i>d</i>. 1614), and their son and grandson, left Hooton manor to live with him in Flanders.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>James Wadsworth, in his anti-Jesuit polemic <span class="italic">The English Spanish Pilgrime</span>, provides a vignette of the elderly captain. He relates that in 1624 Stanley had to go &#145;cap in hand&#146; to counsellors at the Spanish court in pursuit of a pension six years in arrears. When he obtained the money a Spanish Jesuit deceitfully took it from him. As a result he turned away from the Society of Jesus and entered the Carthusians at Ostend. Allegedly Stanley said &#145;that if his Majesty [James I] would grant him pardon, and leave to live the rest of his daies in Lancashire with beefe and bagge-pudding&#146; he would be supremely happy  (Wadsworth, 68&#150;9). He died in Ghent on 3 March 1630. His funeral at Notre Dame des Malines was a lavish affair.<br>
<br>Opinion about William Stanley has been polarized since his surrender of Deventer to the Spanish. The question remains whether he was following the dictates of his conscience or reacting pragmatically to short-term privation. Given the personal nature of the decision, it is difficult to determine the degree of foreknowledge and calculation involved. He was assuredly not the only soldier at the time in contact with the Spanish enemy; however he and York were the only such figures to change sides. The same questions hang over his subsequent plots against the English crown, which could either be interpreted as expressions of pure ideology, or as shrewd and cynical bids for financial and social preferment by making himself appear indispensable to Spanish strategy against England. It has been suggested that Stanley was particularly obsessed with the claim to the throne of his relative Ferdinando Stanley, later earl of Derby and the grandson of Mary, sister of Henry VIII. But, as Cardinal Allen indicated, he may have had strong opinions about the legitimacy of the territorial rights of princes. While serving in Ireland, he believed that the brutal suppression of the Desmond rebellion was just retribution for those seeking to overthrow the legitimate monarch of Ireland. By the same token he may have thought of the Dutch revolt as a comparable challenge to the legitimate prince of the Low Countries, a challenge he could not in conscience support. Despite these uncertainties, and given that both his brothers were members of the Society of Jesus, it is likely that Stanley did feel more comfortable, both spiritually and politically, in the continental Catholic camp.<br>
