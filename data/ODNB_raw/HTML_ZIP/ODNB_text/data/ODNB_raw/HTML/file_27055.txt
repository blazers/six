<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1750&#150;1826), <span class="occ">hymn writer</span>, was born at Norwich on 30 July 1750, the second son of the eight children of Richard Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1762), a manufacturer, of Colegate, Norwich, and was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27046/', "John Taylor (1694&#150;1761)")</script>. His mother was Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1781), daughter of Philip Meadows, mayor of Norwich in 1734, and granddaughter of John Meadows, the ejected divine. Her only sister, Sarah, was the grandmother of Harriet Martineau.<br>
<br>Taylor was educated under Mr Akers at Hindolveston, Norfolk, but upon the death of his father he left to assist his mother in the family business. Three years later he was apprenticed to Martin and Wingfield, a firm of manufacturers in Norwich, after which he spent two years as a clerk to a banking firm in London. He there began to contribute verses to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. In 1773 he returned to Norwich, and started a yarn factory in partnership with his younger brother, Richard. On 24 April 1777 John Taylor married <a href="#cosubject_27082">Susanna (1755&#150;1823), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cook [<i>see below</i>]</a>; they had seven children.<br>
<br>Taylor was active in municipal and social affairs at Norwich, and was a prominent member of the Octagon Presbyterian Unitarian Chapel, of which he acted as deacon for nearly fifty years. He devoted his leisure to literary pursuits, and his verse and hymns were held in wide repute. He was a member of the Norwich Anacreontic Society, and sang in more than one of the festivals. His stirring song &#145;The trumpet of liberty&#146;, with the refrain &#145;Fall, tyrants, fall&#146;, was first published in the <span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span> of 16 July 1791; it has been ascribed in error to William Taylor (1765&#150;1836).<br>
<br>Taylor was the author of several hymn tunes, but his musical composition was inferior to that of his elder brother, Philip Taylor of Eustace Street Presbyterian Chapel, Dublin, grandfather of Colonel Philip Meadows Taylor. On the other hand, his hymns and verses were everywhere used in Unitarian services. He edited <span class="italic">Hymns Intended to be used at the Commencement of Social Worship</span> (1802), in which ten by himself are included, and published a collection of forty-three of his own compositions in 1818. These, with additions, were reprinted in <span class="italic">Hymns and Miscellaneous Poems</span> (1863), with a memoir reprinted from the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> (September 1826) and edited by his son, Edward Taylor. Many of these hymns are to be found in Robert Aspland's <span class="italic">Psalms and Hymns for Unitarian Worship</span> (1810; 2nd edn, 1825), the <span class="italic">Norwich Collection</span> (1814; 2nd edn, 1826), James Martineau's <span class="italic">Hymns of Praise and Prayer</span> (1874), <span class="italic">Hymns for the Christian Church and Home</span> (1840), and W. Garrett Horder's various collections. Perhaps the best-known are those beginning &#145;Like shadows gliding o'er the plain&#146;, &#145;At the portals of Thy house&#146;, and &#145;Supreme o'er all Jehovah reigns&#146;.<br>
<br>Taylor contributed anonymously to the <span class="italic">Cabinet</span> (3 vols., 1795) verses in the style and orthography of the seventeenth century, of which those on Richard Corbet were included in Gilchrist's edition of the bishop's poems, and others on &#145;Martinmasse day&#146; were cited in <span class="italic">Time's Telescope</span> (1814) as an ancient authority for the way in which that day is kept. Taylor's <span class="italic">History of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich</span> was completed by his son Edward, and published in 1848. John Taylor died after a fall from a gig near his son Philip's house at Halesowen in Shropshire on 23 July 1826, and was buried in the Unitarian burial-ground at Birmingham.<br>
<br>John Taylor's wife, <a name="cosubject_27082"></a><span class="headword">Susanna Taylor <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cook]</span></span>  (1755&#150;1823)<span class="occ"></span>, born in Norwich on 29 March 1755, was the daughter of John Cook and Aramathea Maria Phillips. She was a woman of much force of character, who shared the liberal opinions of her husband, and is said to have danced &#145;round the tree of liberty at Norwich on the receipt of news of the taking of the Bastille&#146;. Sir James Mackintosh corresponded with her on many subjects, and Anna Letitia Barbauld was her devoted friend, speaking of her &#145;strong sense, her feeling, her energy, her principle, her patriot feelings, her piety, rational, yet ardent&#146; as marking &#145;a character of no uncommon sort&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 20, 1825, 487). Her other friends included Sir James Edward Smith, Henry Crabb Robinson, John Alderson, Amelia Opie, William Enfield, Frank Sayers, William Taylor (who was no relation), Basil Montagu, the Gurneys of Earlham, and the Sewards. A political element was added to her literary gatherings by Sir Thomas Beevor, Lord Albemarle, and Thomas William Coke (afterwards earl of Leicester), member for Norfolk (1790&#150;1818). Her intimate friends called her Madame Roland, from the resemblance she bore to the French champion of liberty. She also contributed essays and verse to the budget read at periodic meetings of the Taylor and Martineau families, for which many of her husband's verses were composed.<br>
<br>Susanna Taylor took charge of her daughters' education, instructing them in philosophy, Latin, and political economy. Susan Taylor (1788&#150;1853) was later to marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23295/', "Henry Reeve (1780&#150;1814)")</script>, and Sarah Taylor was to achieve fame as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/916/', "Sarah Austin (1793&#150;1867)")</script>, translator and literary hostess, the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/911/', "John Austin (1790&#150;1859)")</script>, jurist. Susanna Taylor's sons were also gifted: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27059/', "John Taylor (1779&#150;1863)")</script> was a successful mining engineer; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27074/', "Richard Taylor (1781&#150;1858)")</script> became a printer and naturalist; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27025/', "Edward Taylor (1784&#150;1863)")</script> became Gresham professor of music; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27071/', "Philip Taylor (1786&#150;1870)")</script> was a civil engineer; and Arthur Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1790) was a printer and author of historical works.<br>
<br>Susanna Taylor died in June 1823. A monument to her and her husband was erected by their children in the Octagon Chapel, Norwich.<br>
