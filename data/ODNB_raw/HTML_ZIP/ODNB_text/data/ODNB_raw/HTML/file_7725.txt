<span class="headword">Docwra,  Henry</span>, first Baron Docwra of Culmore  (<em>bap. </em>1564, <em>d.</em> 1631), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was baptized on 30 April 1564 at Thatcham parish church, Berkshire, the second son of Edmund Docwra (<i>d</i>. in or after 1590), politician and landowner, and his wife, Dorothy. Docwra's family owned the manor of Chamberhouse, Berkshire, but his father, an undistinguished MP for Aylesbury and New Windsor, fell into financial difficulties and was forced to sell. This situation may have influenced Docwra's decision to go into the army: he became a professional soldier serving under Sir Richard Bingham in the west of Ireland in 1585 and soon captained his own company. For the next decade he was actively engaged in warfare in Ireland.<h2>
<a name="WarfareinIreland15861600"></a>Warfare in Ireland, 1586&#150;1600</h2>On 1 March 1586 Docwra was prominent in Bingham's siege of Cloonoan Castle in Thomond, one of the strongest fortresses in the present co. Clare, then held by Mathghamhain or Mahon O'Brien; on O'Brien's surrender all the warders were put to the sword without mercy. After this victory against the O'Briens Bingham turned his forces against the Mayo Burkes, besieging their castle of Annagh near Ballinrobe, sometimes called Annis, as well as their other stronghold on an ancient crannog towards the middle of Lough Mask known as Caislean-na-Caillighe (the &#145;hag's castle&#146;). On refusing a parley to surrender, Bingham's men including Docwra's company burnt the boats which the Burkes had in dock at Castle Hag to prevent their escape but the first attack failed in a storm on the Mask, some soldiers were drowned, and the Burkes secured a number of boats to escape to the woods of Kilbride. Bingham also then abandoned the attack on Annagh Castle. In July 1586 Docwra's headquarters was at Ballinrobe whence he made sorties against the Burkes, and their allies the O'Malleys, Gibbons, Joyces, Philbins, and MacDonnells.<br>
<br>Meanwhile a force of hired Scottish mercenaries was on the Erne waterways, advancing to ally with the Burkes; Docwra, under Bingham, marched north to Sligo to prevent their advance. Some of the O'Rourkes of Leitrim, the McGuires and supporters of Art O'Neill of Tyrone, who was later an ally of Docwra, joined the Scots on the Curlew Mountains. At first the invaders into Connaught were successful; Bingham and Docwra had to retreat, many men were drowned at the confluence of the Owenmore and Owenboy rivers near Colooney, and some of the enemy Scots escaped into the Ox Mountains. The decisive engagements, however, took place at Aclare, near modern Tobercurry, in co. Sligo, and on the River Moy outside Ballina at Ardnarea on 23 September 1586, where over 1000 fighting men and an equal number of attendants, women, and children, were slaughtered. Little was accomplished by severity and many of the Mayo Burkes continued in rebellion. In recognition of his distinguished military services Docwra was made constable of Dungarvan Castle, the chief administrative centre of co. Waterford, in 1594, which post he relinquished to Sir George Carey, treasurer at war, on 23 August 1599. On the decline of Bingham's fortunes Docwra transferred his allegiance to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex; Docwra gained his own command under the earl and fought with him at Cadiz, where he was knighted in 1596. When Essex was given the supreme command in Ireland he employed Docwra in the preparation and conduct of the seasoned troops who were to be transported from the Netherlands to Ireland in the winter of 1598&#150;9. George Gilpin told Essex in a letter from The Hague that Docwra had &#145;fine prospects of advancement, being well thought of; but the importance of the war in Ireland, and his devotion to the queen and to you [Essex] have made him resolve to return&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 9.21), while Docwra himself assured Essex on 12 January 1599 of his &#145;unspeakable contentment&#146; that he had been given this particular service  (ibid., 22&#150;3). Docwra's company, with that of Sir Charles Percy, was employed in reducing the rebellion in the Wicklow Mountains, where Docwra distinguished himself at Arklow in June 1599.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1600&#150;01, following Essex's disgrace, the government earmarked Docwra for &#145;the most desperate assignement&#146;, as he would later describe his task under Lord Deputy Mountjoy, Essex's replacement, of planting garrisons along the Foyle to divide the forces of O'Neill from those of O'Donnell. Over the winter and spring months of 1600 he gathered an army of about 4000 foot and 200 horse at Chester, and he landed the bulk of them at Carrickfergus on 25 April 1600; there they were reinforced by a further 1000 troops, before reaching the Foyle on 14 May. A landing was made at Culmore, where they dug in with earthworks and refurbished the remains of a castle abandoned by Colonel Edward Randolph in 1566. A detachment under Captain Lloyd fortified the ancient fort of Ellaugh, which commanded the southern approach to Innishowen, co. Donegal, and on 22 May Docwra's forces possessed the &#145;iland and the fort of the Derry&#146;  (McGurk, plate facing p. 222). In the building up of his forts, ramparts, houses, and the beginnings of the celebrated &#145;walls of Derry&#146; as well as a military hospital&#151;a process which destroyed many ancient monastic and ecclesiastical buildings&#151;Docwra may be considered the founder of the modern city of Derry. He had accomplished his first major objective.<h2>
<a name="Concludingthewar16001602"></a>Concluding the war, 1600&#150;1602</h2>Docwra's second project, and the wish of the government&#151;that he accomplish similar works at Ballyshannon, the key crossing point between Ulster and Connaught and much used by O'Donnell&#151;was greatly delayed for lack of resources. His forces in Derry were decimated by sickness and desertions, and he could not establish Ballyshannon by sea for lack of men and ships. His final strategy, slow yet certain (though subsequent events in the war rendered its completion unnecessary), was to continue his chain of forts connecting the Foyle and the Erne to reach Enniskillen, whence he could embark a force to Belleek, a mere 3 miles overland march to Ballyshannon. On 1 June 1600 he received the submission of Sir Art O'Neill, and on 28 June, with a force of 500 foot and 40 horse, Docwra fought a major battle against O'Dogherty and his allies at Ellaugh, Innishowen. His lieutenant Sir John Chamberlain was unhorsed and Docwra's own horse shot under him in rescuing Sir John. In these engagements the Irish captured horses and prisoners, and generally had the immediate advantage. Irish chroniclers lauded Docwra's personal courage in battle, calling him &#145;an illustrious knight of wisdom and prudence, a pillar of battle and conflict&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, 6.2193).<br>
<br>At the end of July, O'Donnell, the McSwineys, and Scottish mercenaries made a major attack in which Docwra was wounded by Hugh Dubh (the Black) O'Donnell, son of Hugh Roe (Red Hugh). Docwra graphically described the incident:<blockquote>At the first encounter I was stricken with a horseman's staff in the forehead, in so much as I fell for dead, and was a good while deprived of my senses &hellip; but the captains and gentlemen that were about me enforced the enemy to give ground &hellip; by means whereof I recovered myself was set up on my horse and so safely brought of and conducted home &hellip; I kept my bed of this wound by the space of a fortnight, my chamber a week after, and then I came abroad to take view and muster of all the companies. (<span class="italic">Narration</span>, 242)</blockquote>Outbreaks of camp diseases reduced his soldiers to about one third of their complement, but they managed to repulse night attacks by the Irish.Docwra had some talent in weaning local support from his enemies, and he managed to bring over to his side Niall Garbh (the Rough) O'Donnell and his three brothers. Niall probably joined Docwra on the assumption that he would be given the whole of Tyrconnell, modern co. Donegal, as hereditary chief on the cessation of hostilities and by October 1600 he had secured the fortress of the Lifford, opposite Strabane on the Donegal side of the Foyle, for Docwra.<br>
<br>During 1601 Docwra became convinced that the Spanish would invade in the north of Ireland, but few shared his fears; his letters and detailed reports with &#145;shopping lists&#146; of requisite supplies greatly irritated the authorities. However, all was not inactivity, or &#145;dullness and difficulty&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 4.153), at Lough Foyle as Cecil claimed. In 1601 incursions were made into O'Cahan's lands around the present Coleraine and as far east as the Bann. The Innishowen peninsula was taken, providing Docwra with a granary as well as cutting off communication between O'Donnell and O'Neill and O'Cahan, a major objective of the expedition which allowed Mountjoy to attack south Ulster. And, from the Lifford, attacks were conducted by Docwra into Newtown and towards Omagh which he was able to fortify by July 1602. In that year too Dungiven in the Sperrin Mountains bordering north Tyrone and the present co. Londonderry was taken and fortified. In the final phase after Mountjoy's victory at Kinsale, Docwra commanded forces in the famous three-pronged pincer movement of Sir Arthur Chichester from the east, Mountjoy from the south, and Docwra from the west to hem in O'Neill in his final resistance in his homelands around Dungannon.<h2>
<a name="Postwarcareeranddeath16031631"></a>Post-war career and death, 1603&#150;1631</h2>On the conclusion of the war in 1603 Docwra's accustomed prudence and fair dealings with his Irish allies helped to prevent a rising when news of Elizabeth's death reached Ulster. He remained governor of Derry and devoted himself to the general improvement of the city. On 12 September 1603 he received a grant to hold markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays and monthly fairs, and on 11 July 1604 he was appointed provost of Derry for life, with a pension of 20<i>s</i>. a day. In 1606 Docwra applied unsuccessfully for the presidency of Ulster. In 1606 in disgust at the government's treatment of his Irish allies he sold his house, appointed George Pawlett as vice-governor of Derry, and returned to England. By 1607 he had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1648), daughter of Francis Vaughan of Sutton upon Derwent, Yorkshire. They had at least three sons and two daughters. Two of their children, named Henry and Anne, were baptized at Bradfield, Berkshire, on 16 August 1607 and 2 May 1609, and Docwra bought the manor of Bradfield in 1610. While in England Docwra wrote up his &#145;Relation of the service done in Ireland&#146;, an account of his time with Sir Richard Bingham in the west, and in 1614 he wrote &#145;A narration of the services done by the army ymployed to Lough-Foyle, under the leadinge of mee Sir Henry Docwra knight &hellip; together with a declaration of the true cause and manner of my coming away and leaving that place&#146;. Both were published in the nineteenth century. The majority of his Irish letters are printed <i>in extenso</i> throughout the Irish state papers. Robert Pentland Mahaffy, the editor, commented:&#145;Sir Henry Docwra writes in a style of verbose magniloquence which is remarkable even for this period &hellip; [and] makes the task of abstracting difficult and unsatisfactory&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 53). Contemporaries objected to the verbosity and frequency of Docwra's letters.<br>
<br>In 1616 Docwra sold Bradfield and returned to Ireland, where he was appointed treasurer-at-war, and created Lord Docwra, baron of Culmore, co. Derry, on 15 May 1621. On 15 July 1624 he became keeper of the peace in the provinces of Leinster and Ulster and on 30 May 1627 joint keeper of the great seal of Ireland in the absence in England of the chancellor, Viscount Loftus. At the trial of Lord Dunboyne for manslaughter Docwra was appointed one of the fifteen peers on 4 June 1628 and was the only one who voted for a conviction. Docwra died in Dublin on 18 April 1631 and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. His eldest son, Theodore, succeeded him in the title but died without issue, whereupon the barony became extinct.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Docwra was a respected soldier whose personal valour and generally honourable conduct won the admiration of his men and of the enemy. He resorted to battle only when negotiations failed and was consistent in his tactic of dividing the Irish, winning over Niall Garbh O'Donnell for the crucial years of the fighting, Donal O'Cahan, who disputed Coleraine (later Londonderry) with Hugh O'Neill, and Sir Cahir O'Doherty, who occasionally went over to the government side. Docwra was publicly minded and less greedy for advancement and emolument than was usual among Elizabethan officers in Ireland, and as treasurer-at-war he was solicitous for the welfare of the soldiers in Ireland.<br>
