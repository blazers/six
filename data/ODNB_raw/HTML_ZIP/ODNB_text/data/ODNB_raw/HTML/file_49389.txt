<span class="headword">Hudson,  Charles</span>  (1828&#150;1865), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born on 4 October 1828 in Ripon, Yorkshire, the only son of Joshua Hudson, gentleman, and his wife Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Abbott. He had two older sisters. He was educated at St Peter's School, York, under the Revd William Hey, who recalled Hudson as intellectually undistinguished, but exercising influence over others on account of his athleticism. G. F. Browne certainly remembered him as &#145;our very best athlete&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections of a Bishop</span>, 1915, 104&#150;5), capable of a 21 foot long-jump in ordinary boots; on a walking tour in what is now Cumbria in 1845 he averaged 27 miles daily. He was admitted pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, in March 1847, and elected scholar in 1850, taking his BA in 1851, and proceeding MA in 1854. In 1851 Hudson stroked the college eight to head of the river, won the fours and pairs (in a boat fitted with a special rudder to compensate for Hudson's superior strength), and rowed a dead heat in the sculls. In the same year he travelled to Switzerland for the first time, and he spent the winters of 1851&#150;2 and 1852&#150;3 in Geneva. Here his &#145;distinguished and polite manners gained him admission to all the fashionable houses&#146;  (P. Chaix), where he enjoyed dancing until the small hours. Hudson became a keen if unsuccessful chamois hunter, and acquired a taste for alpinism, climbing minor peaks and experimenting with a bivouac in an improvised sleeping bag at over 7000 feet and at -13 &deg;F in February 1853. Between 24 and 25 March 1853 he walked from Bionassay to Geneva and back within twenty-four hours, a round trip of 86 miles.<br>
<br>Hudson was ordained deacon on 18 December 1853, taking priest's orders the following year. He seems to have undergone an evangelical conversion: the secularity of his journals from the early 1850s contrasts with his later pattern of private devotions (even during climbs) and the extreme piety of letters surviving from the 1860s. Frequently taking pupils, he would request their relatives to join him in daily prayer for them at a pre-arranged hour. Hudson assisted the Revd J. Prior at Kirklington, and volunteered as a chaplain to the Army Works Corps in the Crimea, where he spent the winter of 1854&#150;5. After the fall of Sevastopol he crossed Armenia with the unfulfilled intention of climbing Mount Ararat. Hudson was curate of St Mary's, Bridgnorth, from 1856 to 1857, and in 1860 became vicar of Skillington, Lincolnshire. His climbing campaigns in the later 1850s led to his election to the Alpine Club in 1859 (sitting on its council 1863&#150;5) and as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (1865): Leslie Stephen described Hudson as &#145;the strongest and most active mountaineer I have ever met&#146;, and, although much more experienced on snow than on rock, he was widely regarded as having talent and stamina unmatched except perhaps by Whymper. In 1855 he participated in the first ascent of the highest summit of Monte Rosa and the first guideless ascent of Mont Blanc (important in breaking the stranglehold of the Chamonix cartel), an experience recounted with E. S. Kennedy in <span class="italic">Where there's a Will there's a Way</span> (1856).<br>
<br>In 1865 Hudson travelled to Switzerland with a former pupil, D. R. Hadow. After pioneering a new route on the Aiguille Verte and taking Hadow up Mont Blanc, Hudson planned an assault on the Matterhorn with Hadow and the guide Michel Croz. Joined by Lord Francis Douglas, his guides the Taugweilders, and Edward Whymper, the party successfully achieved the first ascent on 14 July 1865. Early in the descent, however, Croz, Douglas, Hadow, and Hudson plunged to their deaths: the initial cause of the accident is unknown. Hudson's horribly mutilated remains were identifiable only from his wallet and a letter to his wife, Emily Antoinette, daughter of Major Charles Mylne of the Bombay army, whom he had married in Paris on 26 June 1862 and with whom he had two children; she lived at least until 1917. He was buried in the village churchyard at Zermatt; in 1913 he was reinterred in the English church there.<br>
