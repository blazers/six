<span class="headword">Richardson,  James Nicholson</span>  (1846&#150;1921), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 7 February 1846 in Belfast, the only child of John Grubb Richardson, an industrialist, and his first wife, Helena Grubb, originally of Cahir Abbey, co. Tipperary. Helena died in childbirth in 1849 and John Grubb remarried in 1853; he had one son and seven daughters by his second wife. James lived with his father and stepmother, between 1853 and 1858 at Brookhill, Lisburn, co. Antrim, and then at Moyallon House near Lisburn. He was educated at home until 1857, and was then sent to a small private school, which closed nine months later. From 1858 to 1862 he attended Grove House School in Tottenham, Middlesex. He married Sophie Malcolmson of Portlaw near Waterford, Ireland, in 1867, after which he made his home at Mount Caulfield, Bessbrook, near Newry, on the border of counties Down and Armagh.<br>
<br>Richardson was a member of a long established linen-manufacturing family in Ireland. Although his father was originally involved in linen bleaching, in 1846 he diversified into flax spinning, erecting a purpose-built mill and creating the model village of Bessbrook for the employees. Six years later he introduced power-loom weaving to Bessbrook. Finally in 1863 John Grubb Richardson bought out the entire business, works, and village of Bessbrook from its parent company, J. N. Richardson Sons and Owden, and formed the Bessbrook Spinning Company. The timing of the formation of the new company proved extremely fortuitous in that it coincided with a sudden and unexpected upturn in the fortunes of the Irish linen industry, caused by the cotton famine in Britain. In the first two years of its existence, annual profits rose from just over &pound;8000 to over &pound;41,000.<br>
<br>James began his apprenticeship in his father's firm in the year of its formation. He was treated exactly the same way as any other apprentice, learning through practical experience about each of the processes involved in flax spinning&#151;hackling, sorting, preparing, and spinning&#151;as well as having to observe &#145;every rule as to hours and routine&#146;  (Smith, 199). He became especially good at judging and buying flax, and he showed an aptitude for &#145;industrial management and for dealing with men of all shades of opinion&#146;  (ibid., 42). As his competence to run the firm became increasingly apparent, his father left it more and more in his hands.<br>
<br>Among the developments at Bessbrook in Richardson's early years of management was the introduction of damask weaving in 1867 and the consequent innovation of the &#145;Bessbrook machine&#146; two years later. In 1868 the firm purchased the nearby Craigmore factory in order to extend its power-loom weaving operations.<br>
<br>In 1878 the Bessbrook Spinning Company was incorporated as a limited company, with Richardson as its first chairman. This allowed him the freedom to participate in other interests. He had for a number of years been committed to land reform in Ireland. Because of this he was persuaded to stand for parliament in 1880. He was elected as Liberal MP for co. Armagh. In parliament he was very involved in promoting land purchase legislation (later achieved in the <span class="roman">Ashbourne Act</span> of 1885. However, he found that public life &#145;was contrary to his own feelings and desires&#146;  (Smith, 62). Furthermore, during his years as an MP his wife's health deteriorated badly. By the beginning of 1884 the strain was beginning to tell and he felt he needed a break. He took a year travelling round the world, after which he decided to retire from politics. He had become disillusioned because of Gladstone's failure to address the temperance question and his support of Irish home rule. During the next five years Richardson suffered from &#145;temperamental depression&#146;, as in 1886 first his wife and in 1890 then his father died. After each bereavement he travelled abroad to find solace. In 1886&#150;7 he toured the Holy Land and in 1890 he went on his second world trip.<br>
<br>On his return to Ireland in 1891 Richardson became very actively involved in unionism, addressing a huge convention in the botanic gardens in Belfast in 1892 and another in Enniskillen in co. Fermanagh in 1893. In that year he remarried. His second wife was Sarah Alexander Bell of Lurgan, co. Armagh. After a honeymoon in Palestine the couple returned to Mount Caulfield. In 1916 Richardson resigned as chairman of Bessbrooks. His physical health began to fail, and he died on 11 October 1921 in a hospital in Edgbaston, Birmingham, after an unsuccessful operation. He had no children by either marriage.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Richardson was a prominent member of the Society of Friends and was renowned for his altruism, especially towards the people of Bessbrook. He provided an orphanage for the children and a convalescent home for the working women. He also laid out a cricket field and built a pavilion, created a bowling green, and bought ground for a golf course. Furthermore, he sold some 5000 acres of his land to his tenants under the terms of the <span class="roman">Wyndham Land Act</span> of 1903 and installed electric lighting in the village in 1911.<br>
<br>Richardson had a sensitive and romantic nature and a love of poetry and art. He wrote many poems and published a variety of pamphlets for the people of Bessbrook. He was also a &#145;born mimic&#146; and an excellent public speaker. His speeches &#145;were brimful of wit and humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, 12 Oct 1921). At his death his estate was estimated at &pound;75,000 (&pound;32,665 of it in England).<br>
