</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">&Oacute; Fiaich,  Tom&aacute;s Seamus</span>  (1923&#150;1990), <span class="occ">scholar and cardinal</span>, was born on 3 November 1923 at Annamore, Cullyhanna, parish of Lower Creggan, co. Armagh, the second of two sons of Patrick Fee (1882&#150;1964), schoolteacher, and his wife, Annie (1891&#150;1932), also a schoolteacher, daughter of Patrick Carragher of Annaghmare and his wife, Anne. His name at birth was Thomas James Fee, and during his early life he used both English and Irish forms of his name interchangeably, but by the 1950s he used only the Irish form. His grandfather, John Fee, a landless labourer, born in co. Louth in 1848 during the great famine, was a fluent Irish speaker. During the Northern Ireland troubles from 1969 onwards, the area of south Armagh around Crossmaglen in which Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Fiaich grew up became a major centre of republican activity. In his youth about half the adult male population of Crossmaglen had served in the British army in the First World War. He remembered it as &#145;very English culturally and politically&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Fiaich had his primary education at Cregganduff public elementary school where his father was a teacher and later headmaster. He had his secondary education at St Patrick's College, Armagh, to which he won an entrance scholarship in 1936. In his youth he was a keen player of Gaelic football and became a knowledgeable follower of Gaelic games, particularly when the Armagh county team was involved. In 1940 he entered St Patrick's College, Maynooth, the national seminary. In addition to his standard seminary courses he took Celtic studies, in which he graduated BA with first-class honours in 1943. A serious illness in 1944 strengthened his determination to become a priest. He did not return to Maynooth, but was ordained in 1948 at St Peter's College, Wexford, a minor seminary.<h2>
<a name="Celticscholar"></a>Celtic scholar</h2>&Oacute; Fiaich's bishop, John D'Alton, recognizing his academic capacity, asked him to resume his studies at University College, Dublin, where he graduated MA in medieval Irish history in 1950. In that year he moved to the University of Louvain. His research there was rewarded in 1952 with a licentiate in historical sciences (Lic. Sc. Hist), <i>avec la plus grande distinction</i>. His period of study in Louvain enabled him to travel widely in search of evidence for the work of medieval Irish monks abroad, a subject on which he became an acknowledged authority. During his time in continental Europe he developed his linguistic skills, becoming fluent in French and German. His contributions to the literature of Irish monastic settlement in Europe included <span class="italic">Irish Cultural Influence in Europe</span> (1966), a life of Columbanus, the seventh-century Irish monk whom he described as Ireland's first European (1974), and <span class="italic">Gaelscr&iacute;nte san Eoraip</span> (1986), an account of Irish shrines on the continent. In recognition of his scholarly work he was awarded the degree of doctor of literature by the National University of Ireland in April 1984.<br>
<br>After a year of parish work in Armagh, &Oacute; Fiaich was appointed lecturer in modern history at Maynooth in 1953 and professor in 1959. He became registrar of the college in 1968, vice-president in 1970, and president in 1974. He combined his academic duties in Maynooth with an enthusiastic involvement in the activities of the Irish language movement. He was a fluent Irish speaker and writer, having mastered the language during many lengthy visits to the Donegal Gaeltacht of Rann na Feirste from childhood on.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Fiaich was a member of every major organization devoted to the propagation of the Irish language as a spoken medium. He was chairman of the commission on the restoration of Irish appointed by the government of the Irish republic in 1959. In 1965 he was appointed chairman of the Irish language advisory council. From 1955 to 1967 he was president of Cumann na Sagart, a society for Irish-speaking priests, and was founder and director of Gl&oacute;r na nGael, which fostered the use of Irish in the everyday life of towns and cities throughout the country. His active support for the Irish language and for compulsory Irish in schools made him a controversial figure in the mid-1960s when a number of groups, most notably the Language Freedom Movement, were agitating for a reduced emphasis on Irish in the educational system and in the public service. In this matter &Oacute; Fiaich was a vigorous defender of the <i>status quo</i>. The only political party in the republic that reflected his cultural nationalism to any appreciable extent was Fianna F&aacute;il, offering as it did at least nominal support to the Irish language movement, and designating itself as republican. He believed that political leaders should have a thorough knowledge of Irish, the first official language. Until De Valera's retirement from the presidency in 1973, the three holders of that office had fulfilled this requirement. When Fianna F&aacute;il nominated Erskine Childers, who knew no Irish and showed no interest in it, as De Valera's successor, &Oacute; Fiaich expressed his displeasure to his close friends, but refrained from public protest.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofArmaghandcardinal"></a>Archbishop of Armagh and cardinal</h2>When Cardinal William Conway died in April 1977 &Oacute; Fiaich was not widely regarded as an obvious successor to the see of Armagh, although his candidature enjoyed strong support among the clergy of the archdiocese. He was appointed archbishop of Armagh by Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1977 and was consecrated on 2 October. He was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II on 30 June 1979. He was the first Armagh man in 800 years to have been appointed archbishop of Armagh. He was also the first primate of all Ireland for over 100 years who was not already a bishop on appointment.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Fiaich's period of office as archbishop was a continuously troubled one. Between 1978 and 1989 over 1100 people died in Northern Ireland as a result of violence. Many young men from the archdiocese of Armagh were interned for paramilitary activities. &Oacute; Fiaich's nationalist background and his known political views made him from the start a target for criticism in the British media, among unionists and among elements of the British government who had reservations about his appointment. His forthright statements on partition and on the British presence in Northern Ireland, together with his comments on what he regarded as the unfair treatment of the Catholic minority, exposed him to sharp rebukes from a variety of unionist politicians. During a long interview with the editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Press</span> in January 1978 he suggested that the British government should issue a declaration of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland. In response the five Church of Ireland bishops with jurisdiction in the six counties issued a statement in support of the union. In January 1984 &Oacute; Fiaich argued that people might be morally justified in joining Sinn F&eacute;in with the purpose of becoming involved in community activities, but not to support the IRA. This view was condemned by many unionists and by the government of the republic. In December 1986 he suggested that the time had not yet come for Catholics to join the Royal Ulster Constabulary. In response, the unionist peer Lord Brookeborough told the House of Lords that &Oacute; Fiaich was &#145;an evil prelate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Press</span>, 9 May 1990).<br>
<br>Either as a priest or as cardinal, &Oacute; Fiaich never offered support to the IRA. On the contrary, he continually condemned IRA violence, while at the same time believing that partition and the British presence in Northern Ireland were root causes of the northern conflict. His even-handed approach to northern politics frequently made him vulnerable to criticism from both sides. At one extreme, loyalists and British Conservatives, particularly at moments of heightened tension, were prone to suggest that he was an IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in propagandist, who implicitly condoned IRA violence. At the opposite extreme, his condemnations of this violence attracted angry responses from republicans. When, for example, he condemned the IRA killing of a police constable in 1978, he was described as a traitor by Provisional Sinn F&eacute;in.<h2>
<a name="Championofprisoners"></a>Champion of prisoners</h2>From the opening of the violent phase of Northern Irish history in 1969 until his death &Oacute; Fiaich was deeply engaged with the plight of political prisoners in Northern Ireland, particularly, though not exclusively, those from the Catholic community. In August 1971 Brian Faulkner's unionist government implemented a policy of internment without trial directed exclusively against Catholics. &Oacute; Fiaich shared and reflected the general view of the Catholic community that selective and often random internment of Catholic men in dilapidated Nissen huts behind barbed wire was an outrage against an entire community. One of &Oacute; Fiaich's responses was conveyed in his Christmas card for 1971, which depicted a Second World War prison camp and a shackled prisoner, with the motto &#145;Long Kesh Concentration Camp&#146;. In August 1978, following a day-long visit to Long Kesh, he compared the conditions in which the prisoners were living to those in the slums of Calcutta. His regular visits to inmates of internment camps and prisons received much publicity, as did his willingness to fraternize with loyalist prisoners. He was involved in the campaign for the release of Irish prisoners gaoled in Britain for the Guildford and Birmingham bombings carried out by the IRA in 1974. His involvement was based on his view that these prisoners were innocent. The British appeal court ultimately decided that none of these prisoners should have been gaoled. In the last year of his life &Oacute; Fiaich visited Irish republican prisoners in the north and midlands of England.<br>
<br>In March 1981 IRA prisoners in the Maze prison began a hunger strike in support of their demand for special category status. This hunger strike, during which ten prisoners died, inflamed nationalist feelings in Northern Ireland to an unprecedented extent. &Oacute; Fiaich, who was opposed to the hunger strikes, appealed to all those involved to call them off. He was in frequent touch with British government officials and made futile attempts to secure a compromise between the hunger strikers and the authorities. In response to the threat to civil order posed by the hunger strikes, &Oacute; Fiaich joined the leaders of other Christian churches in appealing for calm. He pleaded with the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, to intervene personally, but she ignored his plea. The protracted sequence of deaths resulting from the hunger strikes profoundly affected nationalist politics, leading directly to an appreciable growth in support for Sinn F&eacute;in.<h2>
<a name="Conservativepastorandecumenist"></a>Conservative pastor and ecumenist</h2>During his period of office as archbishop of Armagh and leader of the Catholic church in Ireland, &Oacute; Fiaich played an active part in the campaign of resistance to changes in social legislation proposed by successive governments in the republic. There was considerable controversy over attempts to introduce divorce and outlaw abortion. During the debate in 1979 on the <span class="roman">Family Planning Amendment Bill</span>, he publicly opposed the liberalization of the legislation on contraception. In 1986, when Garret Fitzgerald's administration held a referendum with a view to lifting the constitutional ban on divorce, &Oacute; Fiaich led episcopal opposition to the proposal. He argued that even a limited form of divorce would be damaging to society and would eventually result in a liberal divorce regime. He suggested that the Catholic church represented the strongest defence against what he called &#145;the plague of divorce&#146; throughout the world and regarded it as his duty to proclaim the traditional Christian teaching on the matter.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Fiaich's vigorous, uncompromising proclamation of Catholic moral teaching was combined with a strong commitment to ecumenism. None of his predecessors, nor indeed any other Irish church leader of any denomination, had been involved in so wide a range of ecumenical endeavours as he was. Each year during church unity week, he invited speakers from all the Christian denominations, many from abroad, to preach in his cathedral. He travelled throughout Ireland in the company of leaders of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian, and Methodist churches. He regarded such occasions as vital tokens of Christian fellowship, especially at times of tension in Northern Ireland. Observers of these occasions gained the impression that &Oacute; Fiaich's enthusiasm for them was greater than that of the participants from other churches.<br>
<br>Throughout his priestly and episcopal careers &Oacute; Fiaich was an inveterate traveller, participating in numerous pilgrimages, Lourdes being his favourite destination. On 8 May 1990 he died in hospital in Toulouse following a heart attack while leading the annual pilgrimage to Lourdes from the Armagh archdiocese. He was buried on 15 May in the grounds of Armagh Cathedral.<h2>
<a name="Characterandachievements"></a>Character and achievements</h2>&Oacute; Fiaich's spontaneous warmth, his gift for friendship which surmounted social, religious, geographical, and cultural barriers, his generosity of spirit and freedom from pomposity or self-conceit, were qualities that impressed those who knew him. Dispassionate historians have questioned the appropriateness of appointing an ultra-nationalist as leader of the Catholic church in Ireland at a time of rising political and religious tensions in the six counties. His elevation may have owed something to the belief that a man with his Irish-Ireland background and outlook might have been able to persuade militant republicans to espouse constitutional politics. Much as he tried, he failed, as Pope John Paul II did during his visit to Ireland in 1979, to move a substantial body of IRA members in this direction. His inability to exert a decisive influence on the IRA was to become evident during the H-block hunger strikes in 1981. His open sympathy for the demands of the IRA prisoners strengthened their resolve on the one hand, and that of the British government on the other. His public pronouncements on political and religious issues, sometimes made without due reflection on their likely impact, were a reflection of his candour, while at the same time giving the impression that he was deficient in diplomatic skill. Until his appointment as archbishop of Armagh much of his adult life had been spent outside Northern Ireland. As a consequence, he did not fully appreciate the sensitivities of those whose world-view differed radically from his own. Some of his comments, even when motivated by a desire to be even-handed, were liable to antagonize both communities simultaneously. The most egregious example was his suggestion that while 90 per cent of religious bigotry in Northern Ireland was protestant in origin, 90 per cent of political bigotry came from Catholic sources.<br>
<br>For many nationalists, however, &Oacute; Fiaich's sometimes incautious political utterances and stances were not the distinctive mark of his leadership of the Catholic church. He strongly reflected the views of those throughout Northern Ireland for whom nationalism implied an intimate link between religious allegiance, Irish culture, and Irish political identity, reinforced their pride in their heritage, and helped them to maintain their self-respect and dignity during one of the most troubled phases in their history. His record of achievement as a scholar is impressive. His best historical writing was published in <span class="italic">Seanchas Ard Mhacha</span>, the Armagh diocesan journal, between 1954 and 1977. Many of his contributions are substantial, ground-breaking studies, based on primary sources. His work on the Gaelic poets of south Ulster, Mac Cuarta, &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n, Mac a Liondain and Art Mac Cooey, is a significant contribution to the literature of its subject.<br>
