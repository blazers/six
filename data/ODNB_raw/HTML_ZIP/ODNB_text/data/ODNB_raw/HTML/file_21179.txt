<span class="headword">Palmer,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1624), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in Upper Lemington, Todenham, Gloucestershire, one of the three children of Giles Palmer, esquire, and his wife, Muriel Field. In the 1540s Leland described the &#145;Four Shire&#146; stone sited on land belonging to Edward's grandfather; the latter's son acted as Leland's informant, suggesting a family tradition of antiquarian interest. Edward appeared in the list of students of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1572. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1575 where his fellow students included the antiquaries Henry Ferrers of Baddesley Clinton, Warwickshire, and Richard Carew of Antony, Cornwall. He married a kinswoman, Muriel, the daughter of Richard Palmer of Compton Scorpin, Ilmington, Warwickshire. Three sons and four daughters of the marriage were alive in 1624. The Palmers were closely linked to the Overburys, Edward being Sir Thomas Overbury's uncle.<br>
<br>Edward Palmer's interests were predominantly numismatic. Upper Lemington and Compton Scorpin lay either side of the Fosse Way, and Roman coins were often ploughed up in the surrounding fields. Some of these coins Palmer bestowed on Camden, who calls him &#145;an industrious Antiquary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Britannia</span>, ed. Gibson, 240). Fuller writes that &#145;Great [was] his store of Coins, Greek and Roman, in Gold, Silver, and Brasse; and greater his skill in them&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 387). As so often with antiquaries drawn from among the county gentry in this period, Palmer published nothing and his collections were dispersed after his death. When Wood included an account of Palmer in his <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>, the latter's collections were already lost. A wider interest in scholarship is evidenced by his purchase of an island in Virginia for the purpose of setting up an academy; he died before the scheme was accomplished. At the time of his death Palmer was living in London. His will, which shows him to have been a wealthy man (able to make bequests totalling more than &pound;1000 and owning property in New England as well as Virginia), was written on 22 November 1624 and proved on 15 December. His wife had predeceased him.<br>
