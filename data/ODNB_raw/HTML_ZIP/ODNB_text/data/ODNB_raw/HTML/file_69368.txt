<span class="headword">Kitchin,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1588), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1544 and called to the bar there in 1547, but nothing is known of his date of birth or parentage. A reading he gave at the inn in 1564 on the Henrican <span class="roman">Statute of Leases</span> (32 Hen. VIII c. 28), which survives in more than one manuscript copy, contains an interesting discussion of the elements required to enact a statute, as well as a lengthy exposition of how to make a good lease. Appointed reader again in 1572 and treasurer in 1575, Kitchin regularly attended pension meetings at the inn during his lifetime. Little else is known of his career except that he practised in the city of London courts. Kitchin was buried at Islington; his son John was granted administration of his estate in 1588.<br>
<br>In 1580 and 1581 Kitchin published two works of some professional importance, <span class="italic">Le court leete et court baron</span> and <span class="italic">Retourna brevium novelment corrigee</span>. Both were built on content and formats that had previously been available in manuscript as well as print, but Kitchin reconstituted them with exposition under alphabetical headings that gathered together a great deal of learning from the year-books and later case law. Addressing <span class="italic">Le court leete</span> to students at the inns of chancery, and claiming that his intention was to improve their knowledge, he expressed the hope that professionally trained lawyers would soon completely replace those stewards of manorial courts who were merely the &#145;servants&#146; of the lords and &#145;ignorant in the law&#146;  (Kytchin, preface). Indeed, he went so far as to suggest that any manorial court not kept by a properly trained lawyer should be subject to forfeiture under <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings. Quoting from a range of legal authorities stretching from Bracton and Britton to Fortescue, St German, and Staunford, Kitchin acknowledged that one purpose of manorial courts was to maintain the interests of the lords, but he also placed them within a broader framework of royal, as opposed to seigneurial, justice that had been ordained for the punishment of enormities and nuisances to the &#145;publique&#146; within the precinct of the courts. <span class="italic">Le court leete</span> was republished many times in the 1580s, the 1590s, and during the course of the seventeenth century, often along with <span class="italic">Retourna brevium</span>.<br>
