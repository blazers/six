<span class="headword">Osborn,  George</span>  (1808&#150;1891), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister</span>, was born at Rochester, Kent, on 29 March 1808, the eldest of ten children of George Osborn (1764&#150;1836) and his wife, Hannah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lambly). His father was a draper in the town, a class leader among the Methodists for twenty-one years, and a member for over fifty. George junior was educated at Dr Hulett's school at Brompton. He married Elizabeth Chubb, with whom he had eleven children, one of his sons entering the Wesleyan ministry.<br>
<br>Osborn entered the Wesleyan ministry in 1828, and was initially appointed to the St Albans circuit. Thereafter he had nine more appointments in Brighton (1829&#150;31), Liverpool (1831 and 1845&#150;8), Deptford (1832), Stockport (1833&#150;6), London (1836&#150;42), and Manchester (1842&#150;5 and 1848&#150;51). He was conspicuous as a debater very early in life, and rose rapidly in the estimation of his co-religionists, being elected in 1849 into the legal hundred, the governing body of the conference. In 1851 he was nominated one of the Wesleyan foreign missionary secretaries, and retained that office for seventeen years. The jubilee of the foreign missions took place in 1863. In the same year Osborn was elected president of the conference, albeit by the narrowest of majorities, and rendered great service to the missions by his advocacy of their claims in the large towns in England. On the retirement of the Revd Thomas Jackson in 1868 he was elected theological tutor at Richmond College, the institution for training Wesleyan missionaries, and continued to reside there until 1885. He was invited to deliver the first Fernley lecture in 1870, on the work and mission of the Holy Spirit. In 1881, in the year of the first ecumenical Methodist conference, he was for the second time elected to the chair of the conference, on this occasion by a large majority. From 1885 he was a supernumerary minister, and died at his home, 24 Cambrian Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 18 April 1891.<br>
<br>In his approach to theology and church polity Osborn was emphatically on the conservative wing of Wesleyan Methodism, regarded by many as carrying the torch of Jabez Bunting, to whom he largely owed his own elevation in the connexion. Indeed, he himself once declared that in resisting any attempt to alter the principles of Methodism he would spend his last sixpence and breathe his last breath. He therefore became an implacable opponent of all significant reformist tendencies in Wesleyanism, passionately defending the conference line during the secessions in the 1830s and 1840s, and resisting the admission of lay representatives to the conference in 1875&#150;6. At the same time, his commitment to Methodist tradition resulted in two major and long-enduring pieces of historical scholarship, a thirteen-volume edition of <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of John and Charles Wesley</span> (1868&#150;72) and his <span class="italic">Outlines of Wesleyan Bibliography</span> (1869). He also wrote or edited eleven other books and pamphlets, furnished prefaces or introductions to at least seven works, and contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Wesleyan Methodist Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">London Quarterly Review</span>.<br>
