<span class="headword">Taylor,  John Sydney</span>  (1795&#150;1841), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Dublin, the second son of John M'Kinley, a goldsmith. His father (who assumed the name of Taylor) was descended from Captain David M'Kinley, who led the advance of King William's troops at the Boyne, while his mother was a descendant of Patrick Sarsfield, titular earl of Lucan. Taylor was educated at Samuel White's academy in Dublin, the school of Richard Sheridan and Thomas Moore, and at Trinity College, Dublin, which he entered in 1809. He obtained a scholarship in 1812, graduated in 1814, and was a prominent member of the College Historical Society.<br>
<br>In 1815 Taylor was admitted to the Middle Temple, and was called to the English bar in 1822. As a student in London in 1820 he edited a weekly paper with Thomas Crofton Croker called <span class="italic">The Talisman</span>. Shortly after his call he began writing for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. In 1827 he married a Miss Hull, niece of James Perry, who had been a proprietor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. He also began writing for the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, of which he was for a time the editor. Under his management the newspaper became the voice of the Anti-Slavery Society, and was particularly associated with Thomas Clarkson.<br>
<br>Taylor resigned as editor in order to return to the bar, where he made his name in the Roscommon peerage case in 1828, when he established the claim of Michael James Robert Dillon to the dormant peerage. He also proved the madness of Edward Oxford who was charged with shooting at the queen. Taylor was a close college intimate of Charles Wolfe, the author of the lines on the death of Sir John Moore, and in a letter addressed to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> (27 October 1824) first established Wolfe's claim to the authorship of the poem. In 1823 he was a member of a committee, led by Lord Brougham, which promoted the founding of the London Mechanics' Institute, later Birkbeck College. He also spoke in the defence of a number of London church buildings threatened by inappropriate restoration, and was successful in protecting the screen of York Minster. Taylor died on 10 December 1841 and was buried at Kensal Green.<br>
