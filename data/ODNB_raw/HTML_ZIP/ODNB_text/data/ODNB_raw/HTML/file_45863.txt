<span class="headword">Tatlock,  Eleanor</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1799&#150;1811), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the daughter of Richard Tatlock, a naval surgeon (<i>d</i>. before 1797), and his wife, Elizabeth Smith (<i>d</i>. 1797). She might have been born in Sandwich, Kent, where she spent her youth and where her mother died; she later lived in two Buckinghamshire villages, Wooburn and Great Marlow, having left Kent at some time before 1811. Tatlock was a deeply religious woman who described herself as a dissenter (although not a &#145;bigoted&#146; one), but she was baptized in the Church of England, and continued to attend its services, at least on occasion. In one of her poems she praised Church of England worship at Wooburn and she addressed another to the Reverend George Edwards, whose congregation she joined when she lived in Great Marlow.<br>
<br>Tatlock began to publish her poems in religious periodicals, including <span class="italic">The Evangelical</span>, during the final years of the eighteenth century; in 1811 she reported that she had been contributing to those magazines for &#145;more than a dozen years&#146;  (Tatlock, 1.iii). Her most important work&#151;and her only publication except for the poetry which appeared in religious magazines&#151;was a two-volume collection, called simply <span class="italic">Poems</span>, which she published under her own name in 1811. The collection is dominated by &#145;Thoughts in solitude&#146;, a meditative and digressive blank verse poem in six books, which she wrote to comfort herself during a &#145;gloomy winter&#146; after she moved away from her friends in Kent  (ibid., 1.iii&#150;iv). &#145;Thoughts in solitude&#146; gives evidence of the range of her interests, which included theology, history, natural history, and social issues such as the problem of fallen women (notes refer to a female penitentiary). Despite the range of topics touched on in this work, Tatlock claims to have worried about leaving herself open to charges of &#145;female pedantry&#146; and so avoided full documentation of her reading  (ibid., 1.211). Almost everything that is known about her life and opinions comes from information which she included in these volumes, and a number of the shorter pieces, which include hymns and poems based on biblical tales, give further evidence of Tatlock's religious convictions. Like most evangelicals, Tatlock supported abolition; she was also interested in missionary work, which she writes about in poems such as her &#145;Plea for the Jews&#146;. Part of her interest apparently arose from her admiration for the work being done by the ladies affiliated with the missionary societies, whom she praises in her notes on that poem, suggesting that like some other women dissenters of her generation, she might have been willing to explore, however tentatively, the possibility of public (if necessarily secondary) roles for women in religious movements. Tatlock seems not to have married, and there is no certain information about her life after 1811, although Virginia Blain suggests that she might have been the Ellen Tatlock who died in Battersea in 1818, at the age of fifty-five  (Blain, Clements &amp; Grundy, <span class="italic">Feminist comp.</span>, 1055).<br>
