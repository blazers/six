<span class="headword">Malvern,  Walcher  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1135), <span class="occ">prior of Great Malvern and astronomer</span>, was a monk at the Benedictine abbey of Great Malvern near Worcester (founded 1085) and became its second prior; but uncertainty surrounds the period of his priorship, because of the almost complete absence of his name in archival records. As prior he attended the consecration of a new abbot of Tewkesbury in Worcester Cathedral on 23 May 1125, but almost all the remaining information on his life comes from an epitaph discovered buried in the grounds of the abbey in 1711, and now to be seen in St Anne's Chapel in the church:<blockquote>Here lies in a cyst, Doctor Walcher, a worthy philosopher, a good astronomer, a Lorrainer, a pious man and humble monk, the prior of this sheepfold, a geometer and abacist. The people mourn, the clergy grieve on all sides. The first day of October brought death to this elderly man [<i>senior</i>]. May each believer pray that he may live in heaven. (Dugdale, <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>, 3.442)</blockquote>The date &#145;mcxxv&#146; follows, but this appears to be a mistake dating from the time of the monument's restoration, since earlier reports record &#145;mcxxxv&#146; (William Cole's report of 23 June 1746, in BL, Add. MS 5811, fol. 131<i>r</i>, is decisive on this point). There is no independent witness for it, but 1135 as the date of Walcher's death is compatible with other evidence.<br>
<br>His epitaph states that Walcher, like his namesake, Walcher, bishop of Durham (1081&#150;90), and several other important churchmen and administrators in the early Norman period, came from Lotharingia, or Lorraine. His continental origins are corroborated by his report to William of Malmesbury of a miraculous event that occurred &#145;fifteen years earlier&#146; in the abbey of Fulda, which he may have witnessed himself; this report follows an account of the introduction of Marianus Scottus's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> into England by another Lorrainer, Robert the Lotharingian, bishop of Hereford (1079&#150;95).<br>
<br>The interest in astronomy attested by his epitaph is confirmed by the survival of two short texts by Walcher. The first is a set of lunar tables, in the Latin tradition, but calculated with the aid of an astrolabe from an eclipse observed on 18 October 1092 (he had failed to have the instrument with him when he witnessed an earlier eclipse of the moon in &#145;Romona&#146; in Italy on 30 October 1091). This is the first mention in a Latin source of the actual employment of an astrolabe, whose construction and use had been described in texts first translated from Arabic in the late tenth century. This text is extant in several manuscripts, of which the earliest is Bodleian Library, MS Auct. F.1.9 (written between 1120 and 1140 at Worcester Cathedral priory); it often occurs following Robert the Lotharingian's <span class="italic">Excerptio</span>&#151;his commentary on Marianus Scottus's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>The second text is <span class="italic">Sententia Petri Ebrei, cognomento Anphus, de dracone, quam dominus Walcerus prior Malvernensis ecclesie in Latinam transtulit linguam</span> (&#145;the opinion of Peter the Hebrew, surnamed Anphus, concerning the dragon, which the lord Walcher, prior of the church of Malvern, translated into Latin&#146;), a work reporting the information of Walcher's teacher, Petrus Alfonsi, on the times when the moon's orbit crosses that of the sun (the &#145;nodes&#146; of the moon, represented in Indian and Arabic astronomy as the head and tail of a dragon). This text immediately follows the first text in the Oxford manuscript, and is also found in Erfurt, Wissenschaftliche Bibliothek der Stadt, Bibliotheca Amploniana, MS Q.351 and British Library, Cotton MS App. vi, fols. 22<i>r</i>b&#150;22<i>v</i>a (fragment only). The work was composed after 1 April 1120&#151;a date used in an example&#151;and draws on the astronomical tables of al-Khwarizmi, Adelard of Bath's translation of which immediately follows Walcher's work in the Oxford manuscript.<br>
<br>Walcher was one of the earliest Latin scholars to make use of Arabic astronomical data. He may have acquired his interest in science in Lorraine, but he evidently belonged to a small group of scientists working in the west midlands, which included Robert the Lotharingian, Petrus Alfonsi, and Adelard of Bath. In spite of the silence of the charter records, he appears, too, to have had some prestige as a churchman, for William of Malmesbury warns that &#145;if anyone does not believe his [Walcher's] words, he insults religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">De gestis regum</span>, 2.346), and Great Malvern's dependence on Westminster Abbey would have given him direct access to England's capital. His position as prior may have led him to look to the new science of the Arabs to obtain more accurate calculations for the church calendar, while his influence may have contributed to the spread of the new astronomical tables of al-Khwarizmi to more central English Benedictine abbeys, such as those of St Albans, Winchester, and St Augustine's, Canterbury.<br>
