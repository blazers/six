<span class="headword">Shakespear <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wood]</span>, Dame  Ethel Mary Reader</span>  (1871&#150;1946), <span class="occ">public servant and geologist</span>, was born on 17 July 1871 at Biddenham, near Bedford, the daughter of the Revd Henry Wood (<i>c</i>.1829&#150;1912). After attending Bedford high school, she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1891 and took the natural sciences tripos (second class, part one, 1894; first class, part two, geology, 1895). Among the most prominent and noteworthy of the early Newnham students, she was a tennis champion, an active Liberal member of the Political Club, and a star pianist at college concerts.<br>
<br>In 1896 Wood went to Mason College, Birmingham, as assistant to Charles Lapworth (1842&#150;1920), and shortly thereafter began the collaborative work for which she is best known, the preparation, with her Newnham friend and fellow geologist Gertrude Elles, of the monumental monograph <span class="italic">British Graptolites</span> (1901&#150;18). Brought out under Lapworth's general editorship, it presented detailed and reliable descriptions of the members of this huge fossil group, critical in zonal demarcation, division, and correlation in Lower Palaeozoic rocks. It was perhaps the single most notable early contribution by women to British stratigraphic geology, and long remained the basis of research in the area. Elles wrote the text and Wood prepared the illustrations, which were particularly outstanding. She published a number of independent papers as well, those on the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the Welsh borderlands (1900, 1906) being especially notable. A fellow of the Geological Society from 1919, she received the Murchison medal in 1920 for her contributions to the monograph.<br>
<br>Shortly after taking her DSc at Birmingham (1906) Wood married physics lecturer Gilbert Arden Shakespear. Their only child, a daughter, died in infancy. Throughout the First World War she worked extensively to secure reasonable care and retraining for disabled soldiers, serving on pensions committees and civic associations; for nine years (1917&#150;26) she sat on the special grants committee of the Ministry of Pensions. This public service was recognized with an MBE in 1918 and a DBE in 1920. A justice of the peace for Birmingham from 1922, she was much respected for her work on the bench. Care of children and working-class girls was her major concern. Along with Dame Elizabeth Mary Cadbury, she was closely involved in an early and very successful city of Birmingham plan for the boarding of children with foster parents; she herself was an official family visitor. Over the years she also helped poor women and girls, inviting many into her home for periods of rest. She was president of the Birmingham branch of the National Council of Women (1929&#150;32) and for a time of the Birmingham and midland branch of the Federation of University Women. She died of cancer on 17 January 1946, at her home, Caldwell Hall, Upton Warren, Worcestershire, survived by her husband.<br>
