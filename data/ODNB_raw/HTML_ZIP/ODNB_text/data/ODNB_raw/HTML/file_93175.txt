</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gibson,  George</span>  (1885&#150;1953), <span class="occ">trade unionist and mental health worker</span>, was born at 98 Cumberland Street, Glasgow, on 3 April 1885, the third son and seventh of the eleven children of Johnston Robertson Gibson (<i>b</i>. 1847), outdoor labourer, oil merchant, and tobacconist, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1852&#150;1909), daughter of Hugh McDermott and his wife, Annie. His father was a Northern Irish protestant and his mother was a Scottish protestant. Gibson attended Tureen Street public school from the age of five until the age of eleven, when he hit the teacher with his slate (the teacher had thrown a rolled tawse at him). Too scared to return to school, Gibson found a job as a tailor's assistant, the first of a series of jobs with limited prospects that he held during his teens and early twenties. In 1910 he lost his job as a bottler in a local pub after informing the customers that the only difference between the Irish and Scottish blended whisky sold at the pub was the colour. Unable to find a job in Glasgow, Gibson took a job as an asylum attendant at the Winwick Asylum in Newton-le-Willows near Warrington, Lancashire.<br>
<br>Gibson's new colleagues were in dispute with their employers over the provisions of the 1909 <span class="roman">Asylum Officers' Superannuation Act</span>, which had replaced a non-contributory pension scheme with a less generous contributory scheme. Dissatisfied with the Asylum Workers' Association, attendants from Winwick and other asylums across Lancashire met at the Mason's Arms in Whitefield, Manchester, and formed the National Asylum Workers' Union (NAWU). Gibson represented Winwick at the meeting and was elected honorary general secretary. In 1913, with the union on the brink of financial collapse, he was made general and organizing secretary, a position which he held until his retirement in 1947.<br>
<br>Having improved the NAWU finances, Gibson enlisted in the Royal Garrison Artillery in May 1915. Shortly before his unit left for France, he married, on 28 July 1915, Ellen (1886/7&#150;1918), daughter of John Henry Crossfield. Their only child, a daughter, was born in 1916. Gibson rose rapidly through the ranks, receiving a commission in 1917. Having twice been mentioned in dispatches, he left the army in 1919 with the rank of lieutenant, and resumed his union post. Following the death of his first wife, he married, on 2 August 1919, Eva Crabtree (<i>b</i>. 1893/4), a widow, the daughter of Thomas Rowson, dock labourer. They had three daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Under Gibson's leadership, assisted by his deputy Herbert Shaw, the NAWU grew in size and influence during the inter-war years. Not only did Gibson seek to unionize asylum attendants and improve their terms and conditions of service, but he also strove to professionalize their occupation and modernize the mental health services, advocating the humane treatment of patients and speaking out against proponents of sterilization. He gave evidence on behalf of his union to the royal commission on lunacy and mental disorder, in 1925, and later helped the Labour minister of health Arthur Greenwood draft the <span class="roman">Mental Treatment Act</span>, 1930. He sought to achieve his objectives through the Whitley council, but was not averse to using strike action. In 1923 he played a critical role in the Radcliffe Mental Hospital strike, persuading the male attendants to occupy the wards and keeping them informed of developments using semaphore. When the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> called into question Gibson's commitment to the strike by reporting that he and Shaw left the scene to attend a Nottingham race meeting, they brought a libel action against the editor. Gibson and Shaw won their case, receiving damages and a printed apology.<br>
<br>From the late 1920s Gibson began to play a wider role in the trade union movement. In 1928 the public employees' section of the Trades Union Congress elected him as their representative on the TUC general council, of which he remained a member until 1948. He took part in TUC attempts to unionize nurses and improve their conditions. In 1940 he was elected TUC president and chairman of the general council. After his term of office ended in September 1941, he attended the annual conference of the Swedish trade union confederation in Stockholm as the TUC representative. While in Sweden he had a private meeting with the Finnish trade unionist Eero Vuori, at the behest of Anthony Eden, in a vain attempt to persuade the Finnish labour movement to pressure their government into ending the &#145;Continuation War&#146; with the Soviet Union. On his return to the UK, Gibson left for the USA to attend the International Labour Organization conference in New York and raise American support for the British. During the Second World War Gibson represented the TUC on a variety of government bodies. He was a member of the Ministry of Food trade union advisory committee (1939&#150;40), a member of the Rushcliffe committee on the pay of nurses (1941&#150;3), a director of the Children's Overseas Reception Board (1940), and vice-chairman of the National Savings Committee (1943&#150;9). He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Manchester University in 1945, and in the 1946 birthday honours list was made a Companion of Honour in recognition of his war work.<br>
<br>When the Labour Party came to power in 1945 Gibson was one of several senior trade unionists given important public posts, because the government trusted them to represent the interests of working people. He was appointed chairman of the North Western Regional Board of Industry in 1945, and in the following year became a member of the National Investment Council, chairman of North West Industrial Estates, a director of the Bank of England, and a member of the Treasury excess profits tax advisory panel. He made speeches on a wide range of topics, including demobilization and regional development. Gibson's union colleagues did not look favourably on these roles, which they felt were diverting his energies away from the union at a crucial time. The NAWU, renamed the Mental Hospital and Institutional Workers' Union in 1930, had just merged with the Hospitals and Welfare Services Union to form the Confederation of Health Service Employees (COHSE). Some COHSE members were also unhappy with Gibson's involvement in Winston Churchill's United Europe movement. At the COHSE conference in December 1947 disgruntled union members attempted to remove Gibson from the post of general secretary. Having defeated these attempts, Gibson announced his retirement from the union, aged sixty-two. He also resigned as chairman of the North West Regional Board of Industry.<br>
<br>During this period of flux in Gibson's career he began to associate with the convicted fraudster Sydney Stanley, who touted his services as a &#145;contact man&#146; to businessmen seeking raw materials allocations, import licences, and other permissions. Stanley introduced himself to Gibson on a train from Manchester to Euston some time in December 1946 or January 1947. They met each other several times on the train in the coming months. On one occasion, in April 1947, Stanley was accompanied by his brother Marcus Wulkan, who had met Gibson at a fund-raising event during his visit to the USA in 1941. Wulkan expressed a desire to help the UK out of its financial plight. Gibson invited the brothers to attend a dinner party. Stanley befriended Gibson over the course of the following months, promising donations to causes Gibson supported, paying for a private dinner party, arranging for a new suit to be made for Gibson, and giving him trivial gifts. In return Gibson invited Stanley to several dinners, introducing him to senior politicians, who assumed Stanley was respectable because of his relationship with Gibson. Some time in the autumn of 1947 Stanley offered Gibson the chairmanship of a new company at a salary of &pound;10,000 after it had been floated. Gibson did not take up the offer, preferring to accept public office as chairman of the North Western Electricity Board, taking up the post in April 1948 after resigning from the TUC general council. He did, however, make enquiries about the procedure for floating new companies, passing on the information to Stanley. The events surrounding the company flotation and Gibson's friendship with Stanley were to be his downfall.<br>
<br>In September 1948 the London Metropolitan Police and the lord chancellor began an inquiry into allegations of corruption at the Board of Trade. Having received the lord chancellor's report, the prime minister, Clement Attlee, appointed a tribunal of inquiry into the allegations. Chaired by Sir George Lynskey, the tribunal called Gibson and others to give evidence. After considering days of evidence, the tribunal found that Stanley had offered the chairmanship to Gibson in return for his help in floating the company. Although Gibson had declined the offer, he continued to assist Stanley in his scheme. The tribunal was &#145;satisfied that Mr. Gibson did this in the hope of material advantage to himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 Jan 1949, 4). The finding was damning and Gibson resigned his public posts and retired from public life. He did not retire quietly, writing to Winston Churchill to plead his innocence and to Harold Wilson to berate him for spreading malicious gossip. He also appeared in a newsreel, denying the charges and attacking the inquisitorial nature of the Lynskey tribunal which had prevented him from defending himself. Until the end of his life he continued to maintain that he had acted properly.<br>
<br>Gibson was not a healthy man. He suffered from respiratory problems as a result of being gassed during the First World War, and was overweight. Otherwise an affable family man with a fondness for comic songs, he was soured by the experience of the tribunal. He did not, however, see his own position in a tragicomic light: in his unpublished memoirs he likened his sufferings to those of Lord Byron, Oscar Wilde, and Alfred Dreyfus. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> was more proportionate, downplaying the significance of the scandal that blighted the end of his career while remembering the many and various contributions that he made to the trade union movement and the war effort. Gibson died of cardiac failure, flu and bronchitis, and arteriosclerosis, at his home, 2 Demesne Road, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, on 4 February 1953; he was survived by his wife.<br>
