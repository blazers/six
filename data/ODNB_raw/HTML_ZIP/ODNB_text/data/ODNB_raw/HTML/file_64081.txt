<span class="headword">Townshend <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Campbell]</span>,  Caroline</span>, <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Greenwich <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Caroline Scott, countess of Dalkeith]</span>  (1717&#150;1794), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 17 November 1717, the first of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4513/', "John Campbell, second duke of Argyll and first duke of Greenwich (1680&#150;1743)")</script>, and his second wife, Jane Warburton (<i>d</i>. 1767), daughter of Thomas Warburton of Winnington, Cheshire. The duke, &#145;warm-hearted, frank, honourable, magnanimous but fiery-tempered, rash, ambitious, haughty and impatient of contradiction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 1.376), was successively commander-in-chief of the government forces in Scotland and high steward of the household. His second wife, a plain, unsophisticated country woman of much lower rank than he, had been maid of honour to Queen Anne and subsequently served in the same capacity in the household of Caroline of Ansbach, princess of Wales, wife of the future George II. Their eldest daughter was born at 27 Bruton Street, their London house, and christened Caroline, for the princess, who acted as godmother.<br>
<br>The family visited the duke's Scottish estates each summer, but Caroline and her four younger sisters were brought up at Sudbrook, an elegant mansion built by their father on the west side of Richmond Park. Accommodated in a special wing known as &#145;The Young Ladies' House&#146;, they were left to do much as they pleased. Having no son, their father treated Caroline as his heir and summoned her to dine with him on Sundays, but at other times the sisters had little discipline and ran wild. As a result, they were known to contemporaries as &#145;the bawling Campbells&#146; and &#145;the screaming sisterhood&#146;  (Lindsay and Cosh, 5). Even so, Caroline was attractive and extremely eligible. Introduced into London society, she had a brief romance with the earl of Lichfield's son, Lord Quarendon, a personable young man not wealthy enough to be acceptable to her father. Meanwhile, Francis Scott, second duke of Buccleuch, had decided that she would make an appropriate wife for his elder son, Francis, earl of Dalkeith (1721&#150;1750). The dukes met in May 1742 and the match was made. &#145;Lord Dalkeith likes the lady extreamly well, and I don't doubt they will be very happy together&#146;, the duke of Buccleuch commented with satisfaction  (Fraser, 1.487). Caroline's tearful protests and Lord Quarendon's angry assertions that he had been jilted were ignored, and the wedding took place at Bruton Street on 2 October 1742.<br>
<br>Just over a year later, on 4 October 1743, the duke of Argyll died. Because he had no son, his English honours became extinct and his dukedom, which was entailed on the male line, passed to his younger brother. Caroline, however, inherited various properties, including Adderbury, a large seventeenth-century mansion in Oxfordshire, and Caroline Park, Granton, now part of Edinburgh. Originally known as Royston House, the latter had been purchased in 1739 by the duke, who had changed its name in his daughter's honour. Caroline and her husband divided their time between London, Adderbury, and their Scottish properties. Lord Dalkeith was not as handsome as Lord Quarendon, but he was dignified and sincere, and he made an agreeable husband. He represented Boroughbridge in parliament from 1746 to 1747. Caroline gave birth first to a daughter, born in 1743 and named after herself, and then to four sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24875/', "Henry Scott, third duke of Buccleuch (1746&#150;1812)")</script>. The family's happy life was shattered when, at the age of twenty-nine, Lord Dalkeith contracted smallpox and died at Adderbury on 1 April 1750, leaving his estate and the guardianship of the children to his wife. Caroline was five months pregnant, and gave birth to their second daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64082/', "Frances, later Lady Frances Douglas")</script>, on 26 July.<br>
<br>For the next five years Caroline remained a widow, and during that time her eldest son and daughter both died. In 1755, however, she remarried and began a second family. The wedding took place at Adderbury on 15 August. Her new husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27619/', "Charles Townshend (1725&#150;1767)")</script>, eight years her junior, was the brother of George, first Marquess Townshend. Variously described as a brilliant orator able to intoxicate the House of Commons with his witty irrelevancies, and as &#145;the consummate self-seeking political insider&#146;  (note, Charles Townshend MSS), Charles was already MP for Great Yarmouth. With the help of Caroline's connections, he became lord of the Admiralty, secretary at war during the Seven Years' War, and, finally, chancellor of the exchequer. Their first child, Anne, was born the year after their marriage, when Caroline was thirty-nine, and she went on to have three more sons.<br>
<br>In recognition of the fact that Caroline had been unable to inherit her father's titles and principal estates, she was appointed ranger of Greenwich Park, and then, on 19 August 1767, she was created a peeress in her own right, with the title of Baroness Greenwich. Just over a fortnight later, on 4 September 1767, Townshend died suddenly at the age of forty-two. Caroline lived on for almost thirty years more, looking after her property, interesting herself in her family, and enjoying London society. She died at Sudbrook on 11 January 1794. Her title of Baroness Greenwich had been created with remainder to the male issue of her second marriage, but her sons by Townshend had predeceased her, leaving no male children themselves, and so her title became extinct. She was buried in Westminster Abbey, in the Argyll family vault in Henry VII's chapel, on 25 January 1794.<br>
