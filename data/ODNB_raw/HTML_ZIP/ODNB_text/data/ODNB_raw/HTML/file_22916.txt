<span class="headword">Pycroft, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1807&#150;1892), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born on 4 December 1807, probably in the parish of St John, Hampstead, Middlesex, the eldest son of Thomas Pycroft, of Pickwick, Wiltshire, a barrister practising at Bath, and his wife, Mary. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22915/', "James Pycroft")</script>, the writer on cricket, was his brother. Educated first at Bath grammar school, and then under private tutors, he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 13 May 1826. In early 1829 he competed successfully for an East India Company writership presented to the university in the previous year by Charles Wynn, president of the Board of Control, and thus thirty years before it became the norm was the first of the &#145;competition wallahs&#146;, men appointed to the Indian Civil Service as the result of competitive examination. On his success the honorary degree of MA was conferred upon him by the university.<br>
<br>Pycroft arrived in Madras in August 1829 and served in that presidency in various subordinate posts in the revenue and judicial administration of the <i>mofussil</i>, principally in South Arcot, until 1839, when he returned to England on three years' furlough. While in England he married in 1841 Frances Susannah, second daughter of Major H. Bates RA, with whom he had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>On his return to India in 1843 Pycroft was transferred to the secretariat, or headquarters, of the Madras government and never again returned to district appointments. He was first appointed sub-secretary, and then in 1845 secretary, to the board of revenue. His Tamil was sufficiently good for him also to be appointed in 1845 acting Tamil translator to the government. In 1850 he was appointed secretary to the Madras government in the revenue and judicial departments and finally in 1855 chief secretary to the government. The governor of the time, Lord Harris, praised him (as had Harris's predecessors) as an able man, careful and painstaking, but did not think him brilliant or comprehensive in his views.<br>
<br>In October 1862 Pycroft was appointed a member of the legislative council of Madras, in which post he remained for the standard term of five years, before taking his retirement in October 1867. He had been made a KCSI in 1866. With thirty-eight years' experience behind him, he was viewed by Madras civilians as one of the gentleman officials of the old pre-1857 school of company servants, skilled in the art of genial and expansive hospitality. At the time of his retirement he was an <i>ex officio</i> fellow of Madras University and a member of the faculties of arts and medicine, chairman of the managing committee of the Madras Literary Society, and, by virtue of his membership of the Madras council, one of the governors of the Military Male Orphan Asylum at Egmore, Madras. Lady Pycroft was a vice-patroness of the Military Female Orphan Asylum. After his departure Pycroft's memory survived in Madras, for thirty years at least, in the name both of his palatial residence and of a road in the suburb of Nungumbaukum, where he had lived.<br>
<br>Upon his return to England, Pycroft settled in west London and devoted considerable time to philanthropic ventures. In particular he took a leading role in the government of St Mary's Hospital at Paddington. He died from influenza at 13 Eversfield Place, St Leonards, Sussex, on 29 January 1892, and was survived by his widow and their six children.<br>
