<span class="headword">Norwich,  Isaac  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1170&#150;1235/6), <span class="occ">moneylender and patron of rabbinic scholarship</span>, was the only known son of Eliab (or Jurnet) of Norwich (<i>c</i>.1130&#150;1197) and his wife, Muriel. His father, also a moneylender and scholarly patron, was the dominant figure in the twelfth-century Jewish community of Norwich, and was one of the half-dozen or so wealthiest Jews in England. Although Eliab suffered serious losses in 1177, in a failed consortium to lend money to the crown, and was briefly exiled from England during the 1180s, he returned from the continent in 1186 on promise of a fine of 2000 marks, and resided thereafter in Norwich until his death in 1197.<br>
<br>Isaac of Norwich first appears in the records in 1194, as a partner with his father and mother in a small loan contract. Three years later, on his father's death, he paid a fine of 1000 marks to accede as heir to his father's estate. He appears to have been immediately successful. In 1199 his personal wealth amounted to more than 10 per cent of the total taxable wealth of the English Jewish community. His financial transactions extended throughout the eastern counties, and although the bulk of his fortune almost certainly came from moneylending, his six houses in Bishop's Lynn and the quay attached to his own stone house in Norwich suggest that he also had interests in trade.<br>
<br>Like his father, Isaac became the leading figure in the Jewish community of Norwich, carrying on a family tradition of financial support for rabbinical study, which earned Eliab, Isaac, and Isaac's own sons Moses and Samuel the honorific title <i>HaNadib</i> (&#145;the Generous&#146;). Under the family's patronage Norwich became one of the two leading centres in England for Hebrew learning in the half-century after 1190. Isaac and Samuel may have been rabbinical teachers themselves, as well as patrons of other teachers.<br>
<br>Along with other prominent English Jews, in 1210 Isaac fell victim to the wholesale confiscations and imprisonments ordered by King John in connection with the Bristol tallage of that year. Isaac avoided execution by promising the king a fine of 10,000 marks, and in 1213 was transferred from Bristol to the Tower of London. But he may not have been released from the Tower until 1217, when his remaining bonds were returned to him, and he and the rest of the Jews of Norwich were given letters of royal protection. Even so, Isaac continued to come under pressure in the early years of Henry III's reign, especially from the papal legate, Pandulf (<i>d</i>. 1226). In his last years he featured in a number of important legal cases, and also became the subject of a famous caricature drawn on a tallage roll of 1233. A rumour of his death circulated in 1230, but in fact he did not die until late 1235 or 1236.<br>
<br>Isaac had two sons, Moses (<i>b</i>. before 1200) and Samuel (<i>b</i>. before 1204), and a sister, Margalita, who was active on her own account in 1201. Moses moved to London, but was dead by October 1238. Samuel, Isaac's second son, thereupon became the head of the family and the leader of the Norwich Jewish community. Moses had three sons: Abraham, who returned to London in 1252 or early 1253 but died in 1255; Isaac, who converted to Christianity in 1253 after being accused of coin-clipping; and Eliab (or Jurnet), who was also dead by 1255. All were frequent business partners with their uncle Samuel. Samuel himself had no known children, however, and with his death in 1273 the line of Eliab and Isaac of Norwich came to an end.<br>
