<span class="headword">Sergeant,  John</span>  (1623&#150;1707), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic controversialist and philosopher</span>, was born on 2 February 1623 in Barrow upon Humber, Lincolnshire, the son of a respectable yeoman there, William Sergeant. After an early education under one Mr Rawson at school in the neighbouring village of Barton he was admitted as sizar to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1639. With his BA degree gained in 1643 and a recommendation from the master and fellows of his college he was appointed secretary to Thomas Morton, bishop of Durham. That employment introduced him to what he perceived as the devious misuse of texts and quotations in theological arguments; and with his protestant faith thereby undermined he was converted by George Gage to Catholicism. To avoid any danger from his erstwhile friends he was sent under the alias Holland (another being Smith) to the English College in Lisbon. A letter (in the Lisbon collection at Ushaw College) written apparently to his mother at this time refers apologetically to his abandonment of her after &#145;the great charges you had bestowed upon my education at Cambridge&#146;, but hints that &#145;some small allowance&#146; would still be useful. He arrived at Lisbon on 4 November 1643 and after some eight months of devotional exercises was admitted as a student in June 1644. Finally ordained on 12 March 1649 he taught classics and theology, acted as procurator, and then as prefect of studies. Returning to England for some months in 1653 he successfully converted his parents and others to Catholicism and then resumed his academic duties in Lisbon until being sent to represent the college's interest at a meeting of the English chapter in London in 1655. He was appointed as secretary to that body on 19 December, and was to retain that laborious but influential post until ousted by John Leyburn as Rome's replacement late in 1667.<br>
<br>It was while acting as secretary to the chapter that Sergeant made his enduring reputation as a Catholic controversialist, engaging in long-running debates on the rule of faith with such eminent protestant adversaries as John Bramhall, Jeremy Taylor, Henry Hammond, M&eacute;ric Casaubon, John Tillotson, and Edward Stillingfleet. The best known of his numerous theological works (some of which appeared under the initials S. W.) were produced in this context. <span class="italic">Schism Disarm'd</span> (1655) and <span class="italic">Schism Dispatcht</span> (1657) were responses to Hammond&#151;an antagonist for whose diminished book sales and even for whose death these attacks were later held responsible; Bishop Richard Russell recalled reports of how the &#145;beardless&#146; Catholic champion so battered Hammond's &#145;inflated ego that shame made him catch a fatal disease&#146;  (Sharratt, 175). In <span class="italic">Sure-Footing in Christianity</span> (1665) and <span class="italic">Faith Vindicated from Possibility of Falsehood</span> (1667), and later in his <span class="italic">Six Catholick Letters</span> (1687, 1688), Sergeant continued with the vehemence of a convert to urge the superiority of an oral and practical Catholic tradition over protestant resort to the scriptures as a certain ground of faith. His self-confident belief in the validity of his own position and procedures led to charges of arrogance and incivility, and he provoked not only reasoned rejoinders but also personal abuse and threats. Even friendly assessors, while stressing moral excellence and the diverting nature of his conversation, conceded some warmth of temper and impetuosity, and in his autobiographical apologia entitled (when published in 1816) &#145;Literary life&#146; (dated 1700), Sergeant himself recalled how he had been described as &#145;an ill natur'd, absurd fellow, in perpetuall squibbles with everyone&#146;, as well as &#145;a great Drunkard, seldom out of a Tavern, or Alehouse&#146;  (Sergeant, 55). Protestants even accused him of throwing fireballs to stoke up the great fire of London, and he describes how he exonerated himself only by pleading physical incapacity; having looked after friends during the previous year's plague he had become so sick that he survived only as &#145;a mere Skeleton, nothing but Skin and bones&#146;  (ibid., 64). Recovered from that condition by 1673 he was able to evade the arrest allegedly planned, after an anti-Catholic proclamation, by Tillotson and Stillingfleet by fleeing to France at an hour's notice. But while abroad he suffered attack from yet another quarter. His erstwhile friend Peter Talbot, the exiled archbishop of Dublin and a notorious trouble-maker, denounced him (under the pseudonym Lominus) as heretical in <span class="italic">Blakloanae haeresis confutatio</span> (1675), and tried unsuccessfully to procure his censure by an assembly in Paris before approaching the authorities in Rome.<br>
<br>For Talbot, Sergeant's sin was to be a Blackloist, or follower of Thomas White (alias Blacklo), under whose intellectual influence he had come in Lisbon. The perennially hostile and paranoid George Leyburn, too, recalled &#145;the great zeal he had shown at Lisbon towards Mr Blacklow's new notions of philosophy&#146;, and was convinced that it was through White's patronage that Sergeant had been appointed to his post as secretary of a chapter which consisted of &#145;a pack of Mr Blacloes friends&#146;  (G. Leyburn, <span class="italic">Doctor Leyburn's Encyclical Answer</span>, 1661, 86, 16). It was indeed widely accepted that Sergeant &#145;put himself entirely into the hands of White &hellip; to be trained and taught by him&#146;  (Warner, 230), and Russell described how, &#145;with White's demonstrations &hellip; always on his lips and White's books in his hands, he gloried in being his disciple&#146;  (Sharratt, 175). This is not to say that the two did not have disagreements. Having visited White for two months in Rotterdam, at the time of the printing of <span class="italic">Statera morum</span> in 1660, Sergeant believed that even his mentor had gone too far towards encouraging moral laxity, and he published his own critical response as <span class="italic">Statera appensa</span> in 1661. Nevertheless, Robert Pugh was justified in generally implicating Sergeant in White's machinations in his edited collection of letters published as <span class="italic">Blacklo's Cabal</span> (1680); and since Blackloism implied not least the sacrifice of Jesuits in return for religious toleration, the Jesuit Pugh unsurprisingly described Sergeant there as one &#145;of evil reputation&#146;  (R. Pugh, <span class="italic">Blacklo's Cabal</span>, 1680, &#145;Epistle&#146;).<br>
<br>That reputation was confirmed when, following White's death in 1676, Sergeant not only continued to keep Blackloism alive, but was also, after his return to England in 1678, suspected of implication in the Popish Plot. It is this problematic episode which laid him open to charges of being at best temporarily deranged, at worst an informer against the Jesuits. By June 1679 he had withdrawn to Amsterdam with the intention, he claimed, of learning Hebrew. Two months later he was in Brussels, and then in October he returned to London to give information to the privy council  (<span class="italic">The Informations of John Sergeant</span>, 1681). He denied any personal knowledge of a plot, but his evidence seemed further to incriminate John Gavan, one of the priests already executed in the previous June. Following his deposition Sergeant himself was officially exonerated, licensed to live in the capital, and even granted a pension; but he paid a heavy personal and historiographical price, for he never overcame the suspicion and hostility of many fellow Catholics.<br>
<br>Sergeant continued, however, to engage in both theological and philosophical controversy. At a time of sceptical inroads in both those areas he persisted with a typically Blackloist insistence on &#145;beating down scepticism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Method to Science</span>, 1696, preface) and establishing what he believed were secure intellectual foundations. His early interest in that matter is attested by a discussion on moral certainty which he had with John Wilkins, whom he met in Oxford during the protectorate; and that it remained of paramount concern is shown in the philosophical writings of his later years, including, most importantly, <span class="italic">The Method to Science</span> and <span class="italic">Solid Philosophy Asserted Against the Fancies of the Ideists</span> (1697). Fanciful ideists included such formidable proponents as Descartes and John Locke; but basing his own work on essentially Aristotelian foundations Sergeant utilized the earlier syntheses of Thomas White and Kenelm Digby to argue against those modern theorists and against any pragmatic replacement of certainty by probability as philosophy's goal. In this respect Sergeant can be seen as having tried to stem the tide of mainstream modern thought: his repudiation of compromise, his insistence on the need for absolute certainty, and his self-assured confidence in his own ability to attain it put him out of step with his contemporaries, and contributed further to his subsequent neglect; and despite being sometimes claimed as an intellectual precursor of Berkeley he has seldom appeared in histories of philosophy. His <span class="italic">Method to Science</span> provoked a response from the Cartesian Antoine Le Grand, and Locke's heavily annotated copy of <span class="italic">Solid Philosophy</span> survives, but Sergeant himself, while claiming that his critique had &#145;sunke Mr Locke's credit very much&#146;, disconsolately noted that &#145;he never reply'd one word&#146;  (Sergeant, 174).<br>
<br>Sergeant's other late works include <span class="italic">Ideae Cartesianae</span> (1698), a rejoinder to Le Grand; <span class="italic">Raillery Defeated</span> (1699), another response to Talbot; <span class="italic">Transnatural Philosophy</span> (1700), which warranted a second edition six years later; and his personal <span class="italic">Account of the Chapter</span> (1706). Such writings, together with extremely acrimonious correspondence in which he was engaged only weeks before his death, confirm Dodd's judgement that in 1707 he died, as a surviving portrait (now at Ushaw College, Durham) shows him living, with pen still poised in hand. His reputation as a controversialist lived on: as late as 1714 a resolution was unanimously passed at the chapter of the English secular clergy that, for the sake of harmony, his provocative books &#145;containing sharp and severe reflections upon his brethren of the chapter &hellip; be suppressed and destroyed&#146;  (Gillow, <span class="italic">Lit. biog. hist.</span>, 3.619). But by then that &#145;troublesome spirit&#146; (as Russell described him) had himself finally been laid to rest in St Pancras churchyard on 20 October 1707.<br>
