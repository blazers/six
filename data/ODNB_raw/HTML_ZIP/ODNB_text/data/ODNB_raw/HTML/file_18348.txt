<span class="headword">Matthews,  (John) Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1805&#150;1889), <span class="occ">clown</span>, was born on 17 October 1805. As a boy he entered the office of the <span class="italic">Independent Whig</span> (later known, after other changes, as the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>). The stage was popular with those associated with the paper, and after working on it for four years Matthews sought a career in the theatre. He established a reputation at various London theatres during the late 1820s, including the Olympic and Sadler's Wells, and became known as the last of the old-fashioned singing clowns. He had the proper instruction for this pursuit, having learned the trade from Joseph Grimaldi. He went on to appear at Covent Garden for a series of seasons in such pantomimes as <span class="italic">Puss in Boots</span>, <span class="italic">Old Mother Hubbard</span>, <span class="italic">Whittington and his Cat</span>, and <span class="italic">Grammar Gurton</span>. At Drury Lane, where he filled the post of principal clown for nearly forty years, he created a sensation by imitating Duvernay in <span class="italic">La cachuca</span>. Having been engaged by W. C. Macready in July 1837 at &pound;3 per week, he reappeared at Covent Garden, where he brought out <span class="italic">Fair Rosamond</span> and danced a mock bayad&egrave;re dance. He visited Scotland and played in Edinburgh and other provincial cities, then returned to the Olympic in Nelson Lee's pantomime <span class="italic">Riddle me, Riddle me Ree</span>. He crossed the channel in August 1843 to oversee and appear in <span class="italic">Arlequin</span> at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s in Paris. Th&eacute;ophile Gautier spoke of his costume in this production as a &#145;rare fantasy&#146; and praised his parody of the &#145;Cachuca&#146;  (<span class="italic">L'histoire de l'Art Dramatique en France</span>, 1859, 2.260).<br>
<br>Matthews alternated between pantomime and dance when he appeared in a ballet at Vauxhall Gardens alongside the Payne family and Rosina Wright and carried on playing the clown at Drury Lane, the Adelphi, and Covent Garden. On the provincial circuit he was familiarly known for singing such songs as &#145;Hot Codlings&#146;, &#145;Tippitywitchet&#146;, and &#145;The Life of a Clown&#146;, the last of which was composed for him by Michael Balfe. His last appearance was at Drury Lane in 1865 in <span class="italic">Hop o' my Thumb</span>. In that year, after forty years in the theatre, Matthews retired and soon afterwards moved to Brighton, where he spent the last two decades of his life. In the months leading up to his death he was bedridden, but was assisted by his daughter, Clara Matilda Lawrence. He died at his home, 28 Walpole Terrace, on 4 March 1889, and was buried in Brighton cemetery.<br>
