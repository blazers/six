<span class="headword">Abendana,  Isaac</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1699), <span class="occ">Hebraist and book collector</span>, was born in Spain and was taken at an early age to Hamburg, Germany. By 1660 he had completed rabbinical studies and by his own account sought the &#145;wisdom of medicine&#146;  (Katz, &#145;The Abendana brothers&#146;, 36) at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Isaac and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37092/', "Jacob Abendana")</script> clubbed together to produce Hebrew books for the Christian market, and they thereby became acquainted with some of the most eminent Christian Hebraists of the day. Having been approached by Adam Boreel&#151;who with John Durie and Samuel Hartlib in England hoped to persuade a learned Jew to translate the <span class="roman">Mishnah</span>, the Hebraic core of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, into Latin&#151;Isaac Abendana arrived in Oxford on 3 June 1662 and presented himself to Edward Pococke and other prominent Hebraists there. Yet it was John Lightfoot, Christian Hebraist at Cambridge, who secured an academic position for Abendana, and from 1663 until 1667 he was on the payroll of Trinity College, Cambridge, working on his translation of the <span class="roman">Mishnah</span>. He seems to have left Trinity in less than friendly circumstances, possibly because his bookselling came to overwhelm his scholarly duties, but by 1669 he was once again with a proper position, this time as an employee of the university itself. By the time of his final payment in 1676 Isaac Abendana had completed translating the <span class="roman">Mishnah</span> into Latin, nearly thirty years after the project first began to be discussed in the Hartlib circle, although his labours were never published.<br>
<br>Accordingly Abendana left Cambridge and moved to Oxford, spending much of the period between 1681 and 1685 in London, where his brother Jacob was leader of the Sephardi community. From 1689 Isaac served as lecturer in Hebrew at Magdalen College, Oxford, a position he held until his death ten years later. During his Oxford years Isaac Abendana became known as a resident authority on all matters Jewish and as the chief purveyor of Hebrew books, a situation he consolidated by inventing the Oxford diary, which in his original form included not only information relevant to university men but also a yearly essay on some aspect of Jewish religion and culture. These essays made the almanacs widely sought after even when their immediate practical use had passed, and they were later published in book form.<br>
<br>Isaac Abendana died on 17 July 1699 while visiting his friend Arthur Charlett, master of University College, Oxford, who informed the antiquary Thomas Tanner that &#145;Old Abendana rising at 4 to see me, having lighted his Pipe, fell down dead&#146;  (Katz, &#145;The Abendana brothers&#146;, 46). A merchant Jew passing through the town conveyed Abendana's body to London for burial, putting an end to a thirty-seven-year Oxbridge career, during which time he had a virtual monopoly on Hebrew studies at the two universities.<br>
