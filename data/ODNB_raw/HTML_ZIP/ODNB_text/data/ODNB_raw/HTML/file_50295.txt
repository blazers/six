<span class="headword">Hornby,  Albert Neilson</span>  (1847&#150;1925), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born on 19 February 1847 at Blackburn, Lancashire, the sixth son of the seven sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57582/', "William Henry Hornby (1805&#150;1884)")</script>, a cotton spinner and MP for Blackburn (1857&#150;69), and his wife, Margaret Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1898), daughter of Edward Birley of Kirkham, Lancashire. He was educated at Harrow School, at which time the Little Wonder, as he was called, weighed less than 6 stone, &#145;bat and all&#146;. His wiry and agile physique, and perhaps rather simian features, led to his also being nicknamed Monkey. After a brief encounter with Oxford University in 1865, he joined the prosperous family cotton business. A rich man, he was able to devote his life to cricket, and he completed the family transition from milling folk to country gentry. The Hornbys moved in 1861 to rural Nantwich in Cheshire, where Hornby lived for the rest of his life. In 1876 he married Ada Sarah, the wealthy daughter and eldest surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14416/', "Herbert Ingram")</script> of Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, founder of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. They had four sons, of whom the eldest, Albert Henry, (1877&#150;1952) played cricket for Lancashire and captained the team from 1908 to 1914.<br>
<br>Hornby was a dashing, impetuous front-foot batsman, and earned a reputation as the maestro of the short single. He played in 437 first-class matches, including three test matches, making 16,109 first-class runs at an average of 24. In 1881, his finest year, he became the first Lancashire batsman to make 1000 runs (1534, average 40) in a season. He formed a typical amateur&#150;professional, one might even say cavalier&#150;roundhead, opening partnership with the prudent stonewaller Richard Barlow, an association affectionately commemorated in verse by Francis Thompson in his poem &#145;At Lord's&#146; (&#145;My Hornby and my Barlow long ago&#146;).<br>
<br>Having captained the MCC at Lord's in 1878, when the Australians famously won, Hornby led England in the famed &#145;Ashes&#146; test at the Oval in 1882. He captained Lancashire from 1880 to 1893 and in 1897&#150;8, and introduced a more modern concept of team-building, with an Australian-style emphasis on fielding: Hornby himself was an adept cover point and took 313 catches in the course of his career. Under his strict discipline, Lancashire flourished, winning the county championship in 1881, 1882 (jointly), 1889, and 1897.<br>
<br>Hornby was president of Lancashire from 1894 to 1916 and was unyielding in his autocratic influence, becoming easily the club's most powerful figure. His appearance was austere, with his dark hair closely cropped and severely parted, and with a neatly kept moustache. In character loyal, irascible, and valiant, he once made a perilous citizen's arrest during a Sydney crowd disturbance in 1879. W. G. Grace claimed that Hornby's energetic chases among spectators led to the formal acknowledgement of boundaries, and he certainly grasped the requirements of a modern spectator sport, and attempted to create entertaining and successful teams.<br>
<br>Hornby also played football for Blackburn Rovers; he was nine times an England rugby union international; he boxed, he shot, and he was an enthusiastic huntsman. As well as having a cricket field beside his stately home, he kept a sprightly stud of hunters. The &#145;Squire of Lancashire&#146; was injured hunting, and it is thought that the internal injuries he sustained on that occasion eventually contributed to his death. He died after a period of illness, on 17 December 1925, at his home, Parkfield, Wellington Road, Nantwich; he was buried nearby in Acton churchyard.<br>
