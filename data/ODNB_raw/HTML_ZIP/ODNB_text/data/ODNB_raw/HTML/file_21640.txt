<span class="headword">Payn,  James</span>  (1830&#150;1898), <span class="occ">novelist and journal editor</span>, was born on 28 February 1830 at Rodney Lodge, Rodney Terrace, Cheltenham, the second son of William Payn (1774/5&#150;1840) and his wife, Harriet. His father, who was clerk to the River Thames commissioners, a justice of the peace, and also sometime treasurer for the county of Berkshire, lived at Kidwells, near Maidenhead, Berkshire, and kept the Berkshire harriers. James Payn's elder brother was General Sir William Payn (1823&#150;1893), who served in India. As a young boy James Payn was introduced to country pursuits by his father and had to go hunting twice a week, but he preferred to read. His father died in 1840 when Payn was ten, and his mother took charge of his upbringing, but little else is known of her.<br>
<br>Payn went to a preparatory school which he did not enjoy as he &#145;hated lessons of all kinds&#146;  (Payn, <span class="italic">Literary Recollections</span>, 6), preferring to read &#145;works of the imagination&#146;. Despite this loathing of school, he was popular, as he invented stories for his contemporaries. He left and went, as his brother William had done before him, to Eton College, in the summer of 1842. He did not take kindly to the fagging system or the bullying and disliked Latin and Greek. The rejection of an article for the college magazine dented his enthusiasm for writing. His stay was short: Eton College archives record that he left at Christmas of the same year. Payn, however, recalls that he left &#145;after a year or so&#146; when he had been nominated for the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was sent to one of the academy preparatory schools at Woolwich. This was a &#145;crammer&#146; and he resented the system that allowed him no time for reading. In his <span class="italic">Literary Recollections</span> he refers to the school as &#145;Messrs. Hurry and Crammem's&#146; and some years later used this experience in his novel <span class="italic">The Foster Brothers</span> (1859). He passed third for the academy and entered Woolwich in September 1846. His stay here was also short and he left owing to ill health in August of the following year. It was decided that Payn was to go to a private tutor in Devon prior to going up to Cambridge, as his father had wished him to enter the church. His stay in Devon was more conducive to his literary and scholastic interests than had been any of his previous educational establishments.<br>
<br>Payn was admitted as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 27 June 1849, graduating in 1853. He had an eventful university career, being president of the union in 1852, and a member of various societies, but he still had no enthusiasm for formal education. He was on good terms with the scholar William George Clark, and George Brimley (1819&#150;1857), the college librarian. While at Cambridge Payn published his first poem, &#145;The Poet's Death&#146;, in <span class="italic">Leigh Hunt's Journal</span> (15 March 1851). He also published at his own expense his first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Stories from Boccaccio and other Poems</span> (1852), which was well reviewed by George Brimley in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. Payn's university education and his acceptance in print led him to turn to literature as a career. In 1853 he published an article based on his experiences at Woolwich (&#145;Gentleman cadet&#146;, <span class="italic">Household Words</span>, 9 April 1853, 231), which later led to a lasting friendship with Charles Dickens. The article was not well received by the governor of the Royal Military Academy, who complained to Dickens, as editor of <span class="italic">Household Words</span>, that the writer could not possibly have been a cadet at Woolwich. Payn continued to contribute to <span class="italic">Household Words</span> for a number of years.<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge, Payn married Louisa Adelaide Edlin (<i>b</i>. 1830/31) on 28 February 1854 and they moved to Rydal Cottage, Ambleside. Among their neighbours were Mary Russell Mitford and Harriet Martineau. Payn had been introduced to Miss Mitford by his father and she introduced Payn to Harriet Martineau. Both writers encouraged him to further his literary career and through them he met Matthew Arnold, William Allingham, Arthur Clough, and Thomas De Quincey. Payn's early works show the influence of Dickens in characterization and plot, his <span class="italic">Stories and Sketches</span> (1857) being a good example. He greatly admired Dickens&#151;the three-volume <span class="italic">Mirk Abbey</span> (1866) is dedicated to him&#151;but he soon branched out into his own style and range of subject matter. His experiences of living and walking in the Lake District resulted in <span class="italic">Leaves from Lakeland</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Furness Abbey and its Neighbourhood</span> (1862), and the illustrated two-volume <span class="italic">Lakes in Sunshine</span> (1867).<br>
<br>Payn had now begun to contribute to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> and was invited to become co-editor by the novelist Leitch Ritchie in 1858. This required a move to Edinburgh but the Payns did not take to the city nor the Scottish sabbath and in 1861 moved to London, where Payn continued as sole editor of <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, a position he had held since 1859. His first successful novel was the two-volume <span class="italic">Lost Sir Massingberd: a Romance of Real Life</span> (1864) which like so many of his works appeared first in serial form, in this case in <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>. It is claimed that the journal's circulation was increased by 20,000 copies as a result. The story concerns the disappearance of an unsavoury uncle, Sir Massingberd, whose body is finally found trapped in the hollow of an oak tree. Payn was grateful to the novel as &#145;it attracted the attention of some of my masters &hellip; among them was my friend Wilkie Collins&#146;  (Payn, <span class="italic">Literary Recollections</span>, 242), to whom he dedicated <span class="italic">Gwendolyn's Harvest</span> (1870). Dickens, too, praised the book.<br>
<br>Despite being a close friend of Robert Chambers (1802&#150;1871) Payn resigned the editorship of <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> in 1874 (Leslie Stephen says he was dismissed) as he could not work with Robert's brother William (1800&#150;1883). In 1874 he was invited by Leslie Stephen to become reader for the publishers Smith, Elder, a post he held for about twenty years.<br>
<br>Payn's greatest literary success was the two-volume <span class="italic">By Proxy</span> (1878), set in China, in which the hero, Captain Conway, gives himself as the proxy victim for execution in place of his convicted, thieving friend Pennicuik. Needless to say in such a sensation novel, Conway somehow escapes death and returns later to England to put matters right. This novel, together with <span class="italic">Lost Sir Massingberd</span>, established Payn as a popular, but minor, novelist. Although he was never to repeat the success of <span class="italic">By Proxy</span>, he continued to produce novels using exotic locations and plots, with good characterization. In the earlier two-volume <span class="italic">Murphy's Master</span> (1873) he removes some undesirable characters from the story by introducing a sinking island, a fanciful idea which later occurred in real life. He was also a good short-story writer and in one of the stories, &#145;The Fateful Curiosity&#146; in his three-volume collection <span class="italic">High Spirits</span> (1879), his predictions include air-conditioning, a twice daily postal service from Australia, and even the channel tunnel. He contributed to numerous journals, including the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, <span class="italic">Longman's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, and a weekly article in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>.<br>
<br>In January 1883 Payn succeeded Stephen as editor of the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, when Stephen resigned to edit the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Payn was to have a great influence as editor: he increased the amount of light fiction at the expense of literary essays, reduced the size of the journal, and the price from 1<i>s</i>. to 6<i>d</i>., with the introduction of a new series in July 1883. During his editorship he was a great supporter of rising young writers and he published Conan Doyle (to whom he dedicated his mystery novel <span class="italic">The Disappearance of George Driffel</span>, 1896), Henry Seton Merriman, Stanley Weyman, Rider Haggard, and F. Anstey, among others. Payn was closely involved with the Society of Authors founded by Walter Besant in 1884 to promote the rights of authors, especially in relation to copyright and overseas contracts.<br>
<br>Payn's strength was that he knew his limitations as a writer and worked within those limits. He could tell a good story with many ingenious twists and turns, and sometimes with bizarre locations, and he had a good eye for detail and characterization. He was a prolific writer, producing forty-six novels and eight collections of short stories and many essays. His plots ranged from the Gothic to the melodramatic and included comic and adventure situations, some of the latter being in the vein of writers such as Rider Haggard and Kipling. He knew what the public liked and was successful in catering for their tastes, although this is not to say that he wrote for that reason. All his novels were serialized before publication in book form, the majority in <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>. He also produced two volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">Some Literary Recollections</span> (1884) and <span class="italic">Gleams of Memory</span> (1894). Payn is probably now known more for his verse on buttered toast than his novels:<blockquote>
<div>I had never had a piece of toast<br>
</div>
<div>Particularly long and wide,<br>
</div>
<div>But fell upon the sanded floor,<br>
</div>
<div>And always on the buttered side.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</span>, 1992, 370)</blockquote>Frank Anstey describes Payn as &#145;tall, thin, and rather angular, he had a sharp high voice, there was a kindly twinkle behind his spectacles, and he was a brilliant and amusing raconteur&#146;  (F. Anstey, <span class="italic">A Long Retrospect</span>, 1938, 111). Leslie Stephen, who had known Payn since Cambridge, described him as an unaffected person with &#145;a remarkable skill in constructing ingenious situations&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He seems to have had a happy marriage resulting in at least nine children, mainly girls. His third daughter, Alicia Isobel, became the first wife of George Earle Buckle, the editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, though she died the same year as her father.<br>
<br>Chronic rheumatism forced Payn to resign his editorship of the <span class="italic">Cornhill</span> in March 1896. He spent the last years of his life housebound, although his friends, with whom he used to play whist every afternoon at the Reform Club, would come to him for a game. But his health continued to fail and he died on 25 March 1898 at his home 43 Warrington Crescent, Maida Vale, London, and was buried on 30 March 1898 at Paddington old cemetery, Kilburn. His wife survived him.<br>
