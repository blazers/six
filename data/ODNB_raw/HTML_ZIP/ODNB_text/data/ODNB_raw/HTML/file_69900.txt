<span class="headword">Campbell,  Katherine</span>, countess of Crawford  (<em>d.</em> 1578), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75460/', "Sir John Campbell (d. 1546), first knight of Calder")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70941/', "Campbell family of Cawdor")</script>], and Muriel (1498/9&#150;1573&times;5), heir of Cawdor. She married first, before 1 October 1539, James Ogilvy (<i>d</i>. 1547), master of Ogilvy and heir to Airlie. They had five children, three sons and two daughters. When the master was killed at Pinkie on 10 September 1547, Katherine became tutrix to the children, including her son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20595/', "James Ogilvy, fifth Lord Ogilvy")</script>.<br>
<br>Katherine subsequently married David Lindsay of Edzell, ninth earl of Crawford (<i>d</i>. 1558), no later than 12 November 1550, when she was infeft in a conjunct fee of the barony of Ferne. They had seven children, five sons and two daughters. Their eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16694/', "David Lindsay")</script> of Glenesk, who became heir to Edzell but not to Crawford&#151;the latter title reverted to the direct line on the death of the ninth earl on 20 September 1558. Another son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16705/', "John Lindsay")</script> of Balcarres.<br>
<br>The countess of Crawford was appointed tutrix and sole guardian to the children of her second marriage, and until her offspring reached maturity she managed the affairs of the heirs to both Airlie and Edzell. Her widow's terce became the subject of extended litigation between her and the tenth earl, and was not settled until 1563. Katherine did not marry again, but the English ambassador Randolph noted in a letter of 1565 that she was a very eligible widow whose fortunes in yet another marriage were being considered by her kinsman, the fifth earl of Argyll.<br>
<br>Katherine maintained a close working relationship with Donald Campbell, Cistercian abbot of Coupar and curator of her eldest son, James Ogilvy of Airlie. The contents of Coupar Abbey were entrusted to her care by Campbell when his house was purged of &#145;Idolis and Imagis and tubernacuilis&#146; in 1559  (Bardgett, 73). On Donald's death in 1562 the goods and gear of the abbey (except the commend) were granted to the earl of Argyll, who in taking up his gift removed from Katherine's possession some gold coins and rings bequeathed to her personally by the late abbot. Katherine spent four years in litigation trying to recover these items.<br>
<br>After 1560, and more so after 1567, the countess of Crawford found her loyalties divided in the aftermath of the religious reformation and in the political turmoil that followed Queen Mary's abdication. She was not only the tutrix of a major house but a widow with the interests of many children to uphold. The eldest sons of each marriage, James, Lord Ogilvy, and David Lindsay of Glenesk, followed the earl of Crawford into the queen's party during the 1560s. The two daughters of her Ogilvy marriage, however, married into the protestant families of Erskine of Dun and Ogilvy of Inverquharity. The two eldest sons of her marriage to David Lindsay of Edzell were sent to the University of Paris in the mid-1560s under the tutelage of the protestant James Lawson. Their education in France was a condition of Dame Katherine's purchase of the tack of the kirk of Menmure, to which her second (Lindsay) son, John, was collated in 1565. Her interest in their education and her expenses are documented in letters between Lawson and herself.<br>
<br>Katherine's religious opinions after 1560 are difficult to ascertain. She hosted Queen Mary overnight at Edzell in August 1562, and alluded to having attended the court of the queen regent in the 1550s, but Donald Campbell's adherence to the congregation probably brought her into the protestant camp. She maintained a close relationship with John Erskine of Dun, the superintendent of Angus and the Mearns, who borrowed money from her in 1571, and her testament suggests that she had greater confidence in her younger sons, who served the kirk, than she had in the elder two.<br>
<br>The letters from James Lawson and other extant documents, in the Crawford manuscripts and elsewhere, reveal Dame Katherine as a capable individual and administrator. She fought for her rights and for the protection of her interests in the courts. She dealt with merchants, negotiated contracts, and loaned money, ensuring the security of each contract by having it registered in the books of council. She kept around her a very loyal group of servants who carried out her wishes, wrote and witnessed her business, and provided advice when necessary. In April 1570 she made an agreement with her old antagonist the tenth earl of Crawford, whereby David Lindsay of Glenesk would marry the earl's daughter Helen without tocher. This arrangement finally brought to rest a long-standing dispute between the earl and the heirs of Edzell.<br>
<br>The countess of Crawford dictated her latterwill, without pious sentiment, at the castle of Brechin on 10 August 1578. She died there on 1 October following, and was buried at Edzell later the same month.<br>
