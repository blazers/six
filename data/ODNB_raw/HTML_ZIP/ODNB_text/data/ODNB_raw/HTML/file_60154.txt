<span class="headword">Straton,  (Mary) Isabella  Charlet-</span>  (1838&#150;1918), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born, possibly in Wales, with the name Mary Isabella Straton. She walked in the Pyrenees and Alps in the 1860s and began climbing with Emmeline Lewis-Lloyd in the 1870s. They made the first female ascent of Monte Viso in 1870, and the first ascent of Aiguille du Moine in 1871. Jean-Est&eacute;ril Charlet (1839&#150;1925) was her guide on these and all of her later climbs. Before becoming a guide, Charlet had worked as a shepherd and carpenter. Isabella may have first met him at Lewis-Lloyd's home in Nant-gwyllt, Wales, where he had been brought to work for a year as a groom. Although Lewis-Lloyd stopped climbing in 1873, Straton returned to the Alps to climb with Charlet. Their ascents included a 3761 metre peak in the Triolet chain in 1875 that he named Pointe Isabella. She made four ascents of Mont Blanc, including the first winter ascent on 31 January 1876, which made her a celebrity. During the ascent they endured an accident to a porter and a violent storm in which all of her fingers were frostbitten. After restoring circulation to her fingers, they reached the summit and returned to Chamonix after four days and three nights on the mountain.<br>
<br>They married on 29 November 1876, took the surname Charlet-Straton, and lived in a house that Jean built in the hamlet of Les Frasserands, near Argenti&egrave;re in Haute Savoie. She continued to receive her private income, once reputed to be worth &pound;4000 a year. He continued to climb and was well known for his ascent of the Petit Dru in 1879 and for developing new methods of abseiling that were universally adopted. In 1881 they made the first ascent of a beautiful peak in the Aiguilles Rouges, which they christened Pointe de la Pers&eacute;v&eacute;rance in remembrance of the perseverance that they had shown before they had dared to confess their affection for one another. They had three sons, one of whom, Robert, was killed in action in 1915. Isabella had been devoted to him, and contemporaries reported that she never recovered from his death. After an illness she died on 12 April 1918 at La Roche-sur-Foron, Haute Savoie, where she and her husband often spent the winter. She was buried in the cemetery at Argenti&egrave;re.<br>
