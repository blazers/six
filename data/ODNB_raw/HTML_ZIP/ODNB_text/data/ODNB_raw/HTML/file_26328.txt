<span class="headword">Staveley, Sir  Charles William Dunbar</span>  (1817&#150;1896), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26330/', "Lieutenant-General William Staveley (1784&#150;1854)")</script> and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Mather. He was born at Boulogne on 18 December 1817, educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy, Edinburgh, and commissioned as second lieutenant in the 87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) on 6 March 1835. He became lieutenant on 4 October 1839, and captain on 6 September 1844. From July 1840 until June 1843 he was aide-de-camp to the governor of Mauritius, where his regiment was stationed, and where his father was acting governor for part of the time. He was subsequently stationed at Glasgow, and risked his life saving a boy from drowning in the Clyde.<br>
<br>Staveley exchanged to the 18th foot on 31 January 1845, and to the 44th on 9 May. From 15 June 1845 to 11 May 1847 he was aide-de-camp to the governor-general of British North America. An admirable draughtsman, his sketches proved useful during the settlement of the Oregon boundary question in 1846. He was assistant military secretary at Hong Kong, where his father was in command, from 20 March 1848 to 27 February 1851.<br>
<br>Staveley had become major in the 44th on 7 December 1850, and went with it to Turkey in 1854. When the regiment embarked for the Crimea he was to have been left behind on account of illness, but he hid himself on board until the vessel sailed. He was present at Alma and at Balaklava, where he acted as aide-de-camp to the duke of Cambridge. On 12 December 1854 he became lieutenant-colonel in his regiment. The 44th was in Sir William Eyre's brigade, and took part in the attempt on the dockyard creek on 18 June 1855, and in the capture of the cemetery. He was mentioned in dispatches and made CB. He received the Mejidiye (fifth class).<br>
<br>Staveley commanded the regiment from 30 June 1855. It returned to England in July 1856, embarked for Madras in August 1857, and went on to China in March 1860. He had become colonel in the army on 9 March 1858, and on 28 April 1860 he was made brigadier-general, and was given command of a brigade in Michel's division during the Anglo-French expedition to Peking (Beijing). He was present at the capture of the Taku (Dagu) forts, and was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Staveley commanded the British troops remaining in China in 1862 during the Taiping uprising. The rebels threatened Shanghai, and in April Staveley marched against them with a force of about two thousand men, of which about one-third were French and English seamen and marines. He shelled them out of their entrenched camp at Wongkadze, and stormed Tsipu, Kahding (Jiading), Tsingpu (Qingpu), Nanchao (Nanqiao), and Cholin (Zhelin) in April and May. But the Chinese imperial troops were unable to hold all the towns recovered, and he had to withdraw the British garrison from Kahding. In the autumn Kahding and Tsingpu were again taken, and the 30 mile radius cleared of the rebels.<br>
<br>In December Staveley was asked by Li Hongzhang to name a British officer to replace the American Burgevine as commander of the Chinese force which had been formed by the American Frederick Townsend Ward and which came to be known as the &#145;Ever Victorious Army&#146;. Staveley named Charles George Gordon, who had been chief engineer under him in the recent operations. They had served together before Sevastopol, and Staveley's sister was the wife of Gordon's brother. In March 1863 ill health obliged Staveley to resign his command and go home.<br>
<br>In March 1865 Staveley was made KCB and was appointed to command the 1st division, Bombay army. On 25 September 1867 he was promoted major-general, and in November, at Sir Robert Napier's request, was given command of the first division of the force sent to Abyssinia. He organized the base at Annesley Bay, and he conducted the fight on the Arogee plain, which immediately preceded the capture of Magdala. Napier in his dispatch praised Staveley's conduct, and he received the thanks of parliament. In 1864 he married Susan Millicent, daughter of Charles William Minet of Baldwyns, Kent. They had several children and she survived him.<br>
<br>Staveley commanded the western district for five years from 1 January 1869. He was commander-in-chief at Bombay from 7 October 1874 to 7 October 1878, with the local rank of lieutenant-general, which became his substantive rank on 29 April 1875. On 1 October 1877 he became general. He was given the colonelcy of the 36th foot on 2 February 1876, and transferred to the 44th (1st battalion, the Essex regiment) on 25 July 1883. He retired on 8 October 1883, and received the GCB on 24 May 1884. Staveley died at his home, Aban Court, Cheltenham, on 23 November 1896, and was buried at Brompton cemetery on the 27th.<br>
