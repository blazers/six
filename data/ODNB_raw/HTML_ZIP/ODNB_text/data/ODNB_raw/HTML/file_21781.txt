<span class="headword">Peile,  Thomas Williamson</span>  (1806&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and headmaster</span>, eldest son of John Peile, a justice of the peace for Cumberland, was born at Whitehaven on 10 November 1806. He was educated at St Bees School and then under Dr Butler at Shrewsbury School, where he followed B. H. Kennedy as captain of the school, and in 1824 entered Trinity College, Cambridge. After gaining the Davies scholarship in his freshman's year, he graduated BA in 1828 as eighteenth wrangler and bracketed second in the first class of the classical tripos. He was also second chancellor's medallist. He proceeded MA in 1831, and held a fellowship of his college from 1829 until his marriage in 1831 to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of James Braithwaite of Whitehaven. Peile was an assistant master at Shrewsbury from 1828 to 1829. In 1829 he was appointed headmaster of the Liverpool Collegiate School, and in the same year was ordained by Bishop Sumner of Chester. He was chaplain to Lord Westmorland, and in 1831 became perpetual curate of St Catherine's, Liverpool. In 1834 he moved to Durham to hold one of the first tutorships in the newly constituted university. In 1836 he was appointed by the dean and chapter of Durham to the perpetual curacy of Croxdale, near Durham, which he held with his tutorship.<br>
<br>Peile was headmaster of Repton School from 1841 to 1854, when he was succeeded by Steuart Adolphus Pears. Peile began the transformation of Repton from a country grammar school into a boarding-school with the standing of a leading public school. Always known as the Doctor (having taken his DD degree in 1843), he was of &#145;precise and dignified appearance&#146;, disliking unconventional habits among boys and masters alike, his violent temper leading him into quarrels with the latter. He introduced the Shrewsbury practice of rewarding pupils, whose successes included ten fellowships at Oxford and Cambridge, with &#145;merit money&#146;. Peile's policy was achieved at the cost of displacing local boys; a memorial to the governors on their behalf in 1844 was followed by an unsuccessful action in chancery, heard in January 1852, brought by Jeremiah Briggs, a Derby solicitor, alleging that the school was originally founded to provide a free education for the boys of Etwall and Repton. A breakdown in his health brought Peile's resignation in 1854.<br>
<br>Towards the close of 1857 Peile became vicar of Luton, Bedfordshire, a large and populous parish, which he began dividing into districts. But as the task proved too great for his strength, he moved in October 1860 to the newly formed parish of St Paul, South Hampstead. This he held until 1873, when he resigned. He lived in the district until his death at his home, 37 St John's Wood Park, London, on 29 November 1882. He was buried in Buckhurst Hill churchyard on 2 December. His widow and their large family survived him. The eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35457/', "Sir James Braithwaite Peile (1833&#150;1906)")</script>, was an Indian civil servant; their eighth son, Clarence John Peile (1847&#150;1900), was a barrister.<br>
<br>Peile was a sound scholar, and his knowledge of the classics, especially Thucydides and the <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span>, was remarkable. His principal works were editions of the <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> (1839) and <span class="italic">Choephori</span> (1840) of Aeschylus, and <span class="italic">Annotations on the Apostolical Epistles</span> (4 vols., 1851&#150;2). His <span class="italic">Sermons, Doctrinal and Didactic</span> was published in 1868. Peile's <span class="italic">The Church of England not High, not Low, but Broad as the Commandment of God: a Letter</span> (1850) was notable as one of the earliest usages of the term &#145;broad&#146; in connection with the established church, though Peile himself was not an adherent of the so-called broad-church party.<br>
