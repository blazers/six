<span class="headword">Payne,  George</span>  (1803&#150;1878), <span class="occ">racehorse owner and gambler</span>, was born at Northampton on 3 April 1803, the elder son in the family of two sons and two daughters of George Payne of Sulby Hall, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Mary Eleanor, daughter of Ralph William Grey of Backworth House, Northumberland. Payne's father was fatally shot in a duel on Wimbledon Common on 6 September 1810 by a man named Clark, whose sister he had allegedly seduced. Payne was educated at Eton College from 1816 to 1822 and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1823 but indulged his sporting tastes so freely that the college authorities, after much patient deliberation, requested him to leave the university. He came of age in 1824 and took possession of the family seat, Sulby Hall, and the Northampton estates, with a rent roll of &pound;17,000 a year. In addition, he took up the sum accumulated during his minority, amounting to about &pound;300,000. This income proved incapable of keeping pace with his extravagance, however, which was apparent when, as sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1826, he met the judges with an unparalleled display of opulence.<br>
<br>Payne's great sporting love was horse-racing. He owned horses from 1824 to 1878 and attended meetings throughout England, in later years dressed in a black frock coat and a checked gingham neckerchief. Although his black and white racing colours, the famous &#145;magpie jacket&#146;, were familiar sights on racecourses, his only victories of any importance were with the purchased filly Clementina, which won the One Thousand Guineas in 1847, and with Glauca, which won the Cesarewitch. His reckless gambling proved to be his undoing. He would sometimes back as many as twenty horses in a race for a big handicap, and still miss the winner. He also spent nights at the card table, and was among those who in the winter of 1836 accused Henry William, twenty-first baron de Ros, of being a card sharp. During the resulting libel action, on 10 February 1837, when Payne appeared as a witness, his character was attacked by Sir John Campbell, who described him as a &#145;professional gamester &hellip; [who] started as a dupe [but] soon crystallized into something worse&#146;, although Campbell subsequently made an apology  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 and 13 Feb 1837). He squandered his patrimonial inheritance, and Sulby Hall also passed from his hands, together with two other large fortunes which he had subsequently inherited from relatives. From 1835 to 1838 and again from 1844 to 1848 he was master of the Pytchley hounds.<br>
<br>Payne lived a useless life but was honourable and without malice. After being seized with partial paralysis he died, unmarried, at his London home, 16 Queen Street, Mayfair, on 2 September 1878. The prince of Wales and many friends from the racing world were present at his burial, at Kensal Green, on 6 September.<br>
