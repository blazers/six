<span class="headword">Knox,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1633), <span class="occ">bishop of Raphoe</span>, was born in Renfrewshire, the second son of John Knox of Ranfurly in Kilbarchan parish. Educated at Glasgow University under the regime of Andrew Melville, he graduated MA in 1579, and after continuing his theological studies in the college was appointed minister of Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, in 1581, and then minister of nearby Paisley in 1585. He married his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of William Knox of Silvieland; the couple had two daughters and three sons, Thomas, James, and George.<br>
<br>Knox came to James VI's notice in 1592 when he discovered on the isle of Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde George Kerr, a Roman Catholic, bound for Spain with certain papers, the &#145;Spanish blanks&#146;, signed by the conservative northern earls. When Kerr was interrogated the earls were implicated in a proposed Spanish invasion of Scotland. The next year Knox was appointed by the general assembly of the kirk to visit the presbyteries of Ayrshire and was assigned the task of persuading the master of Eglinton to accept Andrew Boyd as minister of Eaglesham, Renfrewshire. In 1597 Knox was made a commissioner to seek out Jesuits, seminary priests, and others suspected of plotting with the king of Spain. He subsequently received parliamentary commendation for his efforts and a pardon for his part in the accidental drowning, in the course of these duties, of Hew Barclay of Ladyland. In 1598 he was selected as one of the assembly's representatives to discuss with James VI a scheme of endowment for the ministry; from 1600 he was active in securing recruits to fill vacancies in the ministry; and in 1602 he was charged by the assembly with visiting the churches of Argyll. However, he seems to have been combative and quick-tempered. Disputes with neighbours went as far as the law courts, where on one occasion Knox struck his opponent, George Stewart, a Paisley burgess. On 4 October 1604 the presbytery is said to have suspended him and required him to do public penance in his church.<br>
<br>None the less, memory of Knox's earlier service to the crown seems to have prevailed, and it played some part in his promotion by the king in February 1605 to the bishopric of the Isles. In this capacity Knox proved a tireless servant of royal policy in the Hebrides. Amid much pomp he was one of the bishops who rode &#145;betwixt the erles and the lords, two and two, clothed in silke and velvet, with their foote mantles&#146;  (Calderwood, 6.943) to the parliament of 1606, which approved the royal supremacy, exacted an oath of allegiance, and affirmed the restitution of the estate of bishops. Knox visited his diocese that year with his authority thus enhanced and further proclaimed in a new seal which depicted a bishop in an open boat, holding a book in his left hand and gesturing over the side with his right. In January 1607 Knox was appointed constant moderator of the presbytery of the Isles. In the meantime he attempted to retain his charge in Paisley, but he eventually resigned and was relieved of it on 12 November 1607.<br>
<br>In spring 1608 Knox was appointed to a new royal commission to the Isles, headed by Andrew Stewart, third Lord Ochiltree. As part of a government programme aimed at curbing clan power, demilitarizing highland and island society, and obtaining rents allegedly due to the crown, it was to negotiate with the chiefs of Islay and Mull. By the autumn Ochiltree had assembled a military expedition. On arrival in the Hebrides he captured several chiefs (by tricking them into coming on board ship to hear a sermon by the bishop) and took the castles of Dunyvaig and Duart. Knox, who reported to the king that the chiefs, now carried off to prison in the lowlands, had &#145;ane servill feir of the executioun of your majesteis justle conceawit wrath aganis tham&#146;  (Goodare, 36), favoured an amicable settlement. In spring 1609 he went to court to confer with the king, and by June had persuaded him to change from a policy of dispossession of defiant chiefs to one of conciliation. Fortified with a new commission from the crown, Knox returned to the isles. Ignoring key instructions to conduct a survey of royal property, he called Hebridean chiefs to a court on Iona, in which nine of them agreed to regulations subsequently known as the statutes of Iona. This attempt to &#145;civilize&#146; men sometimes regarded in other parts of Scotland as barbarians aimed to advance the reformed church within their territories and promote law, order, and acceptance of acts of the Scottish parliament. It also reflected government policies of discouraging Gaelic culture. Ministers' salaries, sabbath observance, and church repairs were negotiated, along with the education, in English and in the lowlands, of the eldest sons of leading islanders. At the same time limitations were placed on chiefs' military retinues and on clan hospitality.<br>
<br>Knox soon returned to Edinburgh, and on 28 September appeared at the privy council. There has been some debate about the impact and importance of the statutes, but they clearly represented a significant manifestation of the Scottish government's stance and a benchmark for future action. Knox's action in &#145;reducing &hellip; the ignorant and wicked people of our Isles to the acknowledgement of God and obedience of the King's Majesty&#146;  (Canny, 198) was itself acknowledged by the council, and it seems to have been his experience in the Hebrides which led the king to reward him on 6&#150;7 May 1610 with nomination to the bishopric of Raphoe in Donegal, Ulster. Consecrated probably between 23 January and 24 February 1611, Knox held the two bishoprics conjointly for the next seven years.<br>
<br>The king's brief to Knox in Raphoe was that &#145;by his pains and travails the ignorant multitude within that diocese may be reclaimed from their superstition and popish opinions&#146;  (Laing, 1.427&#150;8). In a memorandum subsequently passed by James to the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Arthur Chichester, Knox &#145;suggested that the episcopate should be given extraordinary powers to suppress catholicism, including the right to arrest catholic priests&#146;  (Moody and others, 3.209). On visiting his Irish diocese in 1611 he prepared a report on the state of religion there which led the king to instruct the archbishop of Armagh to summon a meeting of bishops in his province to reform abuses. At that date Chichester considered Knox to be a &#145;good bishop for that part of the kingdom, and zealously affected to reform the errors and abuses of the priests and people&#146;, who had &#145;done much more good in church government in the short time of his being among them than his predecessor all his time&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1611&#150;14</i>).<br>
<br>In August 1618 Knox resigned as bishop of the Isles and by the following year he was granted Irish letters of denization. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas, who since his graduation from Glasgow University in 1608 and a period in London seeking preferment had served as a minister on Tiree and had assisted his father in administering his turbulent Scottish diocese. Temporarily taken hostage when the MacDonalds of Islay seized Dunyvaig Castle in 1614, Thomas had been rewarded by the crown with lands in Ulster; provided to the Isles on 24 February 1619, he served until some time between 1 November 1627 and 3 April 1628, and continued to apply his father's policies. The elder Knox died on 17 March 1633.<br>
