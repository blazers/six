<span class="headword">Evans,  Theophilus</span>  (1693&#150;1767), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born on 19 or 20 February 1693 at Penywennallt, in the parish of Llandygwydd, in south Cardiganshire, the son of Charles Evans (<i>d</i>. 1730) and his wife, Elinor Beynon. Little is known of his early education, but it is likely that he attended Carmarthen grammar school, and some circumstantial evidence suggests that he went on to Jesus College, Oxford, but that he left without graduating. He married Alice Bevan of Gelligaled, Glamorgan, some time in 1719&#150;20 and raised three sons (Charles, Theophilus, and Michael) and two daughters (Elinor and Sarah). His favourite grandchild, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15085/', "Theophilus Jones")</script>, author of the celebrated <span class="italic">A History of the County of Brecknock</span> (2 vols., 1805&#150;9), described him, with pardonable exaggeration, as one who &#145;had perhaps as much of the milk of human kindness as any man who ever lived: of the value of money he knew little, books were his only treasures&#146;  (Jones, 2.276).<br>
<br>Three factors moulded Evans's career&#151;his gentry blood, his warm attachment to the Anglican church, and his love of literature. His great-grandfather Griffith ab Evan Jenkin (who lived to be 100) and his grandfather Evan Griffith (popularly known as Captain Tory) were uncompromising royalists and churchmen. From an early age, therefore, Evans was taught to believe that dissent was not only a grave threat to the Anglican cause but also inimical to peace and good order. During his highly productive and sometimes controversial fifty years' service as an Anglican clergyman in Cardiganshire and Brecknockshire, he published an appreciable number of sermons and devotional works (mostly translations of English best-sellers) in which he regularly vilified &#145;heretical&#146; sects, &#145;levelling&#146; Roundheads, and, most of all, &#145;arrogant&#146; enthusiasts. Methodism was anathema to him. He parted company with his patron, Marmaduke Gwynne of Garth, Brecknockshire, when the latter fell under the spell of the prominent Methodist Howel Harris in 1737, and he publicly chastised William Williams (Pantycelyn), who served as his curate in 1740&#150;43, and Daniel Rowland. In <span class="italic">The History of Modern Enthusiasm</span> (1752) he denounced all the allegedly &#145;heretical&#146; sects which had sprouted since the Reformation and, as vicar of Llangamarch, Brecknockshire, he proudly declared in 1762 that his parish was an unblemished Anglican fiefdom: &#145;No Papists, nor any popish School. No Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, or Quakers&#146;  (<span class="roman">Church in Wales records</span>, archdeaconry of Brecon, 1762).<br>
<br>Theophilus Evans was born and bred in the Vale of Teifi, an area highly regarded at the turn of the seventeenth century for the vigour of its spiritual life and the richness of its literary inheritance. Like many other gifted authors, antiquarians, and poets in the locality he learned to transcribe, translate, and compose at an early age, and his most celebrated work, <span class="italic">Drych y prif oesoedd</span> (&#145;Mirror of the primitive ages&#146;; (1716)), was published when he was twenty-three. In this vivid and uncritical epic, Evans not only celebrated what he considered &#145;Anglican&#146; values in the early British church but also the &#145;British history&#146; which had been so mercilessly pilloried since the days of Polydore Vergil. He considered the cynical attitude of English historians towards Brutus and Arthur both humiliating and unjust, and he unashamedly extolled the glorious origins of the Welsh by offering a Welsh-language version of the thesis of the Breton monk Paul-Yves Pezron that the Welsh were directly descended from Gomer, son of Japhet, son of Noah. Writing in robustly patriotic vein, Evans portrayed the history of Wales as a pageant of alien usurpations, bitter defeats, and epic victories. For the first time in their history, the Welsh were provided with a printed account of their own history in their native tongue. <span class="italic">Drych y prif oesoedd</span> caught the imagination of the Welsh reading public and ran to five editions in the eighteenth century. Sixteen editions were published in the nineteenth century and even by the twilight years of the Victorian age it was still far and away the most popular history book in Welsh.<br>
<br>In 1763 Evans made over the living of Llangamarch, Brecknockshire, which he had held since 1738, to his son-in-law Hugh Jones, though he retained the living of Llan-faes, Brecon, until his death on 11 September 1767 at his home, Llwyneinon, Llangamarch, Brecknockshire. He was buried in Llangamarch churchyard. Local inhabitants probably remembered him as the discoverer of the celebrated spring at Llanwrtyd Wells or as the hammer of Welsh dissenters and Methodists, but his posthumous fame rests on the triumphant success of <span class="italic">Drych y prif oesoedd</span>, undeniably one of the classics of Welsh prose.<br>
