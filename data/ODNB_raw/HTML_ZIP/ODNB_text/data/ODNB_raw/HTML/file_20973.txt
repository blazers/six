<span class="headword">Overton,  John</span>  (1762/3&#150;1838), <span class="occ">theological writer</span>, was born at Tetford in Lincolnshire, the son of a cottager. He was appointed an excise officer thanks to the influence of the rector, the Revd Mr Emmeris, in whose home he lived, and Thomas Cholmondeley (later Lord Delamere). This gave him the opportunity to pursue his interest in astronomy. Overton built the telescopes he was to use in his observations. Combining his immense knowledge of biblical writings with his expertise in astronomy he began, from 1812, to formulate anti-deistic arguments, aiming to demonstrate the compatibility of biblical chronology and genealogies with Newtonian laws of science and knowledge of the universe.<br>
<br>Having installed a printing press at his house in Crayford, Kent, in 1816, Overton published his first work, <span class="italic">The genealogy of Christ elucidated by sacred history &hellip; with a new system of sacred chronology and the true meaning of the weeks in Daniel</span> (2 vols., 1817). This he wrote as &#145;an antidote to the venomous pen&#146; of the ideologue Comte C.-F. C. de Volney. By demonstrating the harmony of the laws of the universe with the biblical accounts &#145;rightly understood&#146;, Overton aimed not only to counter Volney's denial of the scientific basis of biblical accounts, but to establish the authenticity of the biblical record on the basis of its accuracy in matters astronomical. In this and other works he defends the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as a work of science, proved through the accuracy of its chronology and genealogies. This thesis was advanced, too, in <span class="italic">The books of Genesis and Daniel (in connection with modern astronomy) defended against Count Volney and Dr. Francis</span> (1820), supplemented by <span class="italic">The Sonship of Christ</span> which was written against J. S. Gorton and the Revd J. H. Evans. The conclusions of these two works were afterwards summarized in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A View of Sacred History and its Chronology in Connexion with Modern Astronomy</span> (1827). Other pamphlets by Overton include <span class="italic">The Chronology of the Apocalypse Investigated and Defended</span> (1822), and <span class="italic">The Apocalyptic Whore of Babylon Considered not the Pope of Rome</span> (1830), reflecting his interest in the correct interpretation of prophetic writings. He was a contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, on the subjects of astronomy and biblical history, for forty years.<br>
<br>Overton founded two Sunday schools, at Foot's Cray and Paul's Cray, Kent. He moved to Rose Cottage, King's Road, Chelsea, London, in 1827 and died there on 1 December 1838, aged seventy-five. He left a widow.<br>
