<span class="headword">Griffiths,  Alan Richard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Bede Griffiths]</span>  (1906&#150;1993), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born on 17 December 1906 at Fritton, Rydens Road, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, the youngest of four children of Walter Griffiths, a manufacturing chemist from Liverpool, and his wife, (Harriet) Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Day. He was brought up in straitened circumstances, his father having lost all his money when Griffiths was four years old. He was educated from 1919 at Christ's Hospital, a charitable foundation of the sixteenth century intended primarily for the poor. It was there that, aged seventeen, he had a mystical experience in which he glimpsed the unfathomable mystery behind creation. This changed his life, colouring his time as an undergraduate at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he made lifelong friends, among them C. S. Lewis, and from where he graduated with a second-class degree in English in 1929. He endured spiritual and psychological crises until in 1932 he became a Roman Catholic. He was baptized on Christmas eve 1932 and only weeks later, on 15 January 1933, was clothed as a postulant at the Benedictine abbey of Prinknash, where he found relative peace.<br>
<br>For the next twenty-two years Griffiths led the normal life of a Benedictine monk. He was solemnly professed on 21 December 1937 and ordained priest on 9 March 1940. He was highly regarded as the guest master at Prinknash and was seen as a natural leader, so it was no surprise when in 1947 he was sent to St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough, as superior. This proved not to be a success, however, and after four years he was, as one of his fellow monks said, &#145;reduced to the ranks&#146; and sent to Pluscarden, near Elgin, the most northerly Benedictine abbey in the world. There he was regarded as a holy man with outstanding pastoral gifts, and he became both novice master and master of studies. It was there too that his interest in eastern spirituality, which began when he read Yeats's translation of the <span class="roman">Upanishads</span>, led to a longing to go to India.<br>
<br>Eventually Griffiths's dreams were realized and in 1955, a year after the publication of his autobiography <span class="italic">The Golden String</span>, having been given his abbot's permission and having obtained the necessary indult of exclaustration (permission to leave the abbey to which he had been assigned), he went to India. He felt something lacking in both the Western world and the Western church and wanted to experience &#145;the marriage of these two dimensions of human existence, the rational and intuitive, the conscious and unconscious, the masculine and feminine. I wanted to find the marriage of East and West&#146;. He went to India, indeed, to &#145;find the other half of my soul&#146;  (<span class="italic">Marriage of East and West</span>, 1&#150;2).<br>
<br>After an unsuccessful attempt to set up a monastic community near Bangalore with Father Alapatt, an Indian Benedictine, Griffiths moved to Kerala with Father Mahieu, a Cistercian monk who also wanted to make a foundation in India. On 20 March 1958 the two monks, together with two young aspirants, began life high on the holy mountain of Kurisumala. They lived a Cistercian interpretation of the Benedictine rule, practised the liturgy of the Syrian church, and honoured the tradition of the Indian sannyasi. It was a monastic experiment, and it was successful. During Griffiths's ten years there he became increasingly well known and respected through his writings and appearances at conferences. In 1963 he went to America, where he was awarded the gold medal of the Catholic Art Association for his work on the ecumenical approach to non-Christian cultures. From then on he travelled frequently, giving public talks and interviews on themes such as Christian-Hindu dialogue, the nature of consciousness, meditation, duality, and the integration of mind, body, and spirit.<br>
<br>In 1968 Swami Abhishiktananda (Henri Le Saux, a Benedictine monk), who with the French priest Jules Monchanin had in 1950 founded Saccidananda ashram, also known as Shantivanam, in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, decided to retire to the Himalayas. He asked Father Mahieu if he could send some monks to run the ashram. In August 1968 Griffiths arrived with two novices, and took over the running of the ashram from Abhishiktananda. He was to stay there, as the monastic superior, for the last twenty-five years of his life. Under his aegis Shantivanam became a magnet to people of all ages and nationalities, but most of all it was the young who were drawn there, attracted by the emphasis on meditation, by the steady beat of the Benedictine day, and by the liturgy, based on the monastic office but incorporating Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Sufi texts and singing bhajans, often in the local Tamil. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the ashram grew and flourished, with Griffiths's gifts as guest master giving the place great warmth and his wisdom as a spiritual counsellor being in constant demand. The way he bridged Hinduism and Christianity, experiencing all religions as complementary rather than in competition, made Shantivanam a place where people of different religious traditions could meet in an atmosphere of prayer.<br>
<br>Early in 1990 Griffiths had a stroke which led to a profound spiritual experience of overwhelming love. He recovered enough to travel and give talks in America, Europe, and Australia, but by the beginning of 1993 he was again unwell and was unable to travel to England to receive the John Harriott memorial award for outstanding work in religious communication, sponsored by <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>. He was a twentieth-century prophet who, like yeast, leavened the flour and water of institutional religion. He died at Shantivanam after a final stroke on 13 May 1993.<br>
