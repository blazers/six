</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Doggett,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1670&#150;1721), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Castle Street, Dublin, though nothing is known of his family or upbringing. Apparently by his early teens he was already engaged as a thespian, being listed in a 1684&#150;5 manuscript cast for an intended production of John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Night Walker</span> at Smock Alley, and various authorities have suggested that for the next several years he performed as a stroller. He eventually made his way to London, where in January 1691 his appearance at Drury Lane as Deputy Nincompoop in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Love for Money</span> marked the beginning of a long and successful career. It was his creation of the role of Solon in D'Urfey's <span class="italic">The Marriage-Hater Matched</span> at Drury Lane a year later that marked his first triumph: the <span class="italic">London Mercury</span> remarked that the author ought &#145;to present Mr Dogget &hellip; with half the Profit of his Third Day&#146; as the play's success &#145;was half owing to that admirable Actor&#146;  (26 Feb 1692). During the next twenty years Doggett went on to establish himself as one of the most talented and versatile comedians on the London stage, being termed by John Downes (<i>c</i>.1708) as &#145;the only Comick Original now Extant&#146;  (Downes, 108).<br>
<br>In the early years of his career Doggett performed numerous comic roles, and became a personal favourite of William Congreve. The playwright tailored characters for Doggett's talents, from Fondlewife in <span class="italic">The Old Bachelor</span> to Ben in <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>. To these successes can be added Sancho Panza in D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (pt 1), Mass Johnny in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">The School-Boy</span>, Savil in Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Scornful Lady</span>, Marplot in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span>, Sir Oliver in George Etherege's <span class="italic">She Would if she Could</span>, and Sir Tristram Cash in Charles Johnson's <span class="italic">The Wife's Relief</span>, to name only a few of literally dozens of parts. On occasion he could also perform roles of a quite different nature, such as Shylock in George Granville's <span class="italic">The Jew of Venice</span>, and his singing in D'Urfey's <span class="italic">The Richmond Heiress</span> earned him the praise of John Dryden.<br>
<br>Early in his career Doggett recognized his own acting gifts, and like his fellow performer Colley Cibber with <span class="italic">Love's Last Shift</span>, created a play featuring himself in the best role. <span class="italic">The Country Wake</span> received its premi&egrave;re in April 1696, with Doggett in the role of Hob. This play achieved some initial success, but became wildly popular in its later revised form as <span class="italic">Hob, or, The Country Wake</span> (first performed 6 October 1711; published 1715), an afterpiece which achieved notable success for decades. There is controversy over the authorship of <span class="italic">The Country Wake</span>, with Cibber frequently being mentioned as the adapter, but no convincing evidence has surfaced to prove Cibber's hand, and Doggett was certainly competent enough to revise his own play. The enduringly successful <span class="italic">Hob</span> inspired at least three later adaptations or sequels: <span class="italic">Hob's Wedding</span> (1720, by John Leigh), <span class="italic">Flora, an Opera</span> (1729, by James Hippisley), and <span class="italic">A Sequel to Flora</span> (1732, also by Hippisley).<br>
<br>Always a shrewd negotiator, Doggett exhibited a keen sense for advancing his career. During 1695&#150;6, for example, he moved back and forth several times between Christopher Rich's Drury Lane troupe and Thomas Betterton's newly formed company at Lincoln's Inn Fields, playing one offer against the other. He also realized early on that he had management potential. In 1697, uncomfortable with Rich's unjust and irregular business practices, but in apparent default of his London contract, he obtained permission under the patronage of Henry Howard, seventh duke of Norfolk, to perform in Norwich, an opportunity which he renewed several times, interspersed with intermittent and limited London appearances, through 1700. The running of the Norwich company allowed him to develop expertise that would later prove invaluable, and he evinced considerable ambition, as exemplified in his production of Betterton's <span class="italic">Dioclesian</span> in 1700, thought to be the first performance of an opera in England outside London. Nevertheless, Rich served Doggett with a warrant in Norwich in 1697, recalling him to London for a hearing. Doggett, Cibber tells us, &#145;was not, in the least intimidated, by this formidable Summons&#146;. He &#145;was not only discharg'd, but the Process of his Confinement (according to common Fame) had a Censure pass'd upon it in Court&#146;, for the plaintiffs &#145;had mistaken their Man&#146; in regard to both legal knowledge and tenacity  (Cibber, 193). The vindicated Doggett returned to Norwich, but in autumn 1702 he rejoined Betterton's company, where he remained for several seasons. The 1706&#150;7 season found him once again heading the duke of Norfolk's provincial troupe.<br>
<br>A turning point in Doggett's affairs took place in March 1709, when he joined with Robert Wilks and Cibber to form a partnership with Owen Swiny to perform later that year at Vanbrugh's Haymarket Theatre. After experiencing several tempestuous seasons, on 6 December 1712 he signed yet another agreement with Wilks, Cibber, and William Collier to operate at the Drury Lane Theatre, a partnership arrangement which very quickly established itself, both artistically and economically. The need to add a fourth partner, Barton Booth, in November 1713 precipitated a crisis which by summer 1714 resulted in Doggett's exit from performance and management at Drury Lane, though he still retained ownership of his share of the business. Doggett remained intransigent in demanding that his one-third share not be diluted by the addition of new partners. His position, as reported by Cibber, was simply that &#145;nothing but the Law, should make him part with [i.e., share] his Property&#146;  (Cibber, 259). From mid-1714 onwards Doggett was no longer actively concerned in the Drury Lane management, and the protracted legal dispute was not resolved until 6 March 1716, when Doggett received &pound;600 and back interest on his share, terms far less favourable than he had hoped to achieve. Relations with Wilks and Cibber improved after the settlement, and he eventually returned to the company to act from time to time. However, 1 April 1717 is thought to be his last-known performance on the stage, appropriately as Hob in <span class="italic">The Country Wake</span>.<br>
<br>Doggett's retirement years saw large changes in his personal affairs. The <span class="italic">Original Weekly Journal</span> of 23&#150;30 August 1718 announced that he was &#145;lately married to a gentlewoman of 20,000 l. fortune&#146;. This sizeable sum, when added to his own considerable earnings from the stage, allowed him, on 1 August 1716 (being the second anniversary of the accession of George I), to establish an endowment for an annual race on the Thames and award for the Watermen's Guild, as an expression of his staunch whiggism. The race, with its award of &#145;Doggett's Coat and Badge&#146; remained as a tradition enduring at least to the end of the twentieth century. The new Mrs Doggett was dead by 1721, and her husband followed her on 20 September 1721; he was buried in Eltham, Kent, on 25 September. No verifiable likenesses of Doggett are known, though a portrait reported to be his image hangs in the Garrick Club and another by Thomas Murray is at Sherborne Castle, Dorset.<br>
