<span class="headword">Thornton,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1397, <em>d.</em> in or before 1465?), <span class="occ">compiler of miscellanies and copyist</span>, son of Robert Thornton and perhaps of Isabel Gray, and brother of Richard, became lord of the manor of East Newton in the parish of Stonegrave, wapentake of Ryedale, North Riding of Yorkshire, on his father's death in 1418. His grandfather, also Robert, died in 1402. Thornton was alive in 1456 and appears, it seems, as a witness to a charter dated 1468, though this evidence conflicts with a family pedigree, originally compiled by a family relative, Thomas Comber, dean of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1699), which suggests that he must have died by 1465, when his second wife, Isabel, is recorded as marrying John Mekylfield. Thornton's first wife was Agnes.<br>
<br>Robert Thornton is believed to be the gentleman amateur compiler and generally careful copyist of two manuscript miscellanies in which he occasionally signs his name: Lincoln Cathedral, MS 91 (A.5.2), known as the &#145;Thornton manuscript&#146;, and BL, Add. MS 31042 (the &#145;London Thornton manuscript&#146;).<br>
<br>Thornton was probably educated at home; he did not attend either university. Local landholdings afforded him a respectable degree of prosperity and influence. In 1441 he was named as an executor of the will of Sir Richard Pikeryng of nearby Oswaldkirk; he appears as witness in land transactions in 1442 and 1448&#150;9; and he was commissioned as a tax collector for the North Riding, in 1453. He may have been a distant relative of Robert Stillington, bishop of Bath and Wells and chancellor of England, and have held some official post such as steward to the abbot of Rievaulx. With his second wife he had three sons, William, Thomas, and Richard. In the Lincoln manuscript William apparently records the birth of a grandchild, Robert, in 1453&#150;4  (Lincoln Cathedral MS 91, fol. 49<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>This paper manuscript of 314 folios, written <i>c</i>.1430&#150;50 (rebound in 1974), is divided into three main sections: secular, religious, and medical (<span class="italic">Liber de diversis medicinis</span>). It is a major source for Middle English romances, both tail-rhyme and alliterative, including the northern version of <span class="italic">Octavian</span>, <span class="italic">Sir Isumbras</span>, <span class="italic">Diocletian</span>, <span class="italic">Sir Degrevant</span>, <span class="italic">Sir Eglamour</span>, <span class="italic">Lyarde</span>, <span class="italic">Thomas of Erceldoune</span>, and <span class="italic">The Awntyrs off Arthure at the Terne Wathelyne</span>. It preserves unique copies of the <span class="italic">Prose Life of Alexander</span>, the alliterative <span class="italic">Morte Arthure</span>, and <span class="italic">Sir Percival of Galles</span>. The religious section contains a variety of prayers, meditations, and instructional material in English and Latin, including works by the Yorkshire hermit Richard Rolle, three short items from Walter Hilton, <span class="italic">John Gaytryge's Sermon</span>, <span class="italic">The Mirror of St Edmund</span>, <span class="italic">The Abbey of the Holy Ghost</span>, <span class="italic">A Revelation of Purgatory</span> (1422), and the unique alliterative <span class="italic">St John the Evangelist</span>. Textual variants suggest that Thornton may have had access to exemplars from a house for female religious, such as the Benedictine priory of St Mary at Nun Monkton. A prayer to St Leonard may connect with the Thornton family's reverence for this saint by whose altar their tomb lay in Stonegrave church. The volume comprises a variety of material for the entertainment and spiritual and bodily health of the compiler and his family, who seem to have read it, and resewn leaves, and jotted their names down in it, until their fortunes waned and it passed into the possession of Lincoln Cathedral, probably via Comber's association with Daniel Brevint, dean of Lincoln (1682&#150;95), and possibly in 1692 when East Newton and its furnishings were sold.<br>
<br>Watermarks suggest that BL, Add. MS 31042 was being compiled contemporaneously with the Lincoln manuscript. Its 179 folios contain English verse romances and religious works less distinctly separated, including two long excerpts from <span class="italic">Cursor mundi</span>, <span class="italic">The Quatrefoil of Love</span>, <span class="italic">Richard the Lionheart</span>, &#145;the Romance of the childhode of Ihesu Criste&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 31042, fol. 163<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">The Parliament of the Three Ages</span>, short religious and didactic pieces by Lydgate, and unique copies of <span class="italic">The Siege of Jerusalem</span>, <span class="italic">The Siege of Milan</span>, <span class="italic">Roland and Otuel</span>, and <span class="italic">Winner and Waster</span>. There is no Chaucer, Gower, or Langland in either volume.<br>
