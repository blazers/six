<span class="headword">Siddall,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1572), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is first recorded in 1530 as a petty canon of Cardinal College, Oxford, where he was admitted BA on 10 March 1531. He was expelled the following year on royal orders when the college failed after Wolsey's fall, and endured considerable difficulties as a result. In June 1535 he supplicated for the degrees of BCL and BCnL, and was admitted on 12 July, having been excused payment of his fee of 1 gold noble on the grounds of his poverty. In the meantime he had been ordained subdeacon on 24 February 1532 (he is not known to have proceeded to higher orders), and on 24 May 1533 was admitted vicar of Farnborough, Warwickshire, though he had resigned it by the end of 1534. On 1 December 1540 he was collated to a canonry in Lichfield Cathedral with the prebend of Stotfold, exchanging the latter for Tervin on 2 December 1547. He also became master of Yotton's chantry in that cathedral. On 12 May 1546 he was admitted rector of Barrow, Cheshire.<br>
<br>Under Edward VI, Siddall showed strongly protestant sympathies. On 30 April 1547 he was presented by the crown to the fifth prebend at Christ Church, Oxford, and in July he was licensed as a preacher. When Pietro Martire Vermigli (known as Peter Martyr) began to preach in Oxford in the spring of 1548, Siddall was prominent among his supporters. In January 1550 he was appointed to a commission to proceed against Anabaptists, then making headway in Essex and Kent. Recorded as vice-dean of Christ Church in 1552, in the same year he supplicated for the degree of DTh. Following the succession of Mary, however, Siddall was quick to conform to Catholicism, thereby retaining his benefices. Active in trying to persuade Thomas Cranmer to follow his example, he was one of the witnesses to the archbishop's fifth recantation, of 26 February 1556, and gave him assurance that his life would be spared. Yet after the accession of Elizabeth he was among the first to subscribe to the royal supremacy, the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and the royal injunctions of June 1559. He may have become rector of Thames Ditton, Surrey, but clearly remained closely attached to Christ Church. In 1571 Siddall presented books by Erasmus to the college, and it was probably there that he died on 2 May 1572, being buried on the south side of the chancel of Oxford Cathedral. He had never married, and on 8 May letters of administration were granted to his sister Elizabeth Costerdyne. Siddall is recorded by his college as &#145;a man inconstant in religion but a loyal steward or treasurer of this church&#146;  (Emden, <span class="italic">Oxf.</span>, 4.551).<br>
