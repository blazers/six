<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pope, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1507&#150;1559), <span class="occ">founder of Trinity College, Oxford</span>, was the elder son of William Pope, a yeoman of Deddington, Oxfordshire, and of his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Edmund Yates of Standlake, Oxfordshire. At his death in 1523, William Pope's estate was valued at &pound;6 a year; he bequeathed half the land and &pound;100 to Thomas. Throughout his life Thomas Pope attached great importance to family ties, and he remained close to his brother, John, and his three sisters. His mother's second husband was John Bustard of Adderbury, Oxfordshire; she died on 25 August 1557.<br>
<br>Pope was educated at Banbury grammar school and at Eton College. He was subsequently articled to Richard Croke, comptroller of the hanaper, for whose family he retained a lifelong affection, even remembering Croke's son in his will. Such loyalty to those who had helped him was characteristic. Pope needed no family influence to rise steadily through the Tudor civil service. His superiors appreciated his efficiency and reticence and the genuine quality of his friendship. In the 1530s he secured a series of increasingly lucrative posts: October 1533, clerk of the briefs in the Star Chamber; the same month, a reversionary grant of the clerkship of the crown in chancery (the position became his in 1537); November 1534, keeper of the change and money in the Tower of London; and, December 1536, treasurer of the newly established court of augmentations. He now ranked as a principal officer of state, responsible for valuing and receiving or selling the land and property of the dissolved monasteries. He was entitled to his own chaplain and to considerable fees and perquisites.<br>
<br>Pope's rise in office was matched by personal advancement. On 26 June 1535 he was granted a coat of arms, and on 15 October 1536 (or perhaps 18 October 1537) he was knighted. Pope quickly impressed, and became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of, the lord chancellor, Thomas Audley, in whose household he was found in 1535. Echoes of his patron's compliance to the monarch, and of his guarded generosity in founding Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1542, are evident in Pope's later life. A very different friend and influence was Audley's predecessor, Thomas More. On 5 July 1535 Pope shouldered the heartbreaking task of informing More of his imminent execution; it was an emotional farewell. In 1538 Pope incurred the displeasure of Thomas Cromwell when he pre-empted him in the purchase of the manor of Drayton, Gloucestershire. His tactful handling of the situation was masterly.<br>
<br>The great love of Pope's life was Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Townsend, the widow of Ralph Dodmer, mercer and mayor of London in 1529. Pope may well have been married before&#151;one uncorroborated antiquarian source records a divorce, from Elizabeth Gunston, performed by the archdeacon of London on 11 July 1536. Six days later he married Margaret; she brought him much happiness and four stepchildren, whom he enjoined the executors of his will to treat as his own. Pope's only child, Alice, was born on 16 April 1537. The couple's family life was short-lived. Alice died in infancy, and Margaret died on 16 January 1539. Both were interred at St Stephen Walbrook in the city of London.<br>
<br>During five years at the court of augmentations Pope was only once personally involved in the actual workings of the dissolution, when he went to receive the surrender of the abbey of St Albans on 5 December 1539. Typically, he retained a lifelong sentimentality towards St Albans, purchasing its former property Tyttenhanger, at Ridge, Hertfordshire, for his country home in 1547. The treasurership was a lucrative post, and offered great opportunities to make a fortune. To buy &#145;church lands without money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.157) was quite possible with a little help from Pope's extensive and obliging family circle. Some at least of his purchases were paid for by means of large entry fines, levied in return for a long lease at a low rent. By 1555 Pope claimed to hold twenty-seven manors in seven counties, principally in his own Oxfordshire. With his accumulated riches, he was generous, but careful. He always demanded value for money in his multifarious gifts and charities.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1541 Pope married Elizabeth, the daughter of Walter Blount, of Blount's Hall, Staffordshire, and widow of Anthony Basford or Beresford, of Bentley, Derbyshire. She brought another stepson, John, and two brothers into Pope's ever-expanding m&eacute;nage. An ambitious and intelligent woman, Elizabeth wholeheartedly shared her husband's aim to found an Oxford college. By 1546 they were living at Bermondsey in Southwark, and the following year Pope moved his London residence to the former Benedictine convent at Clerkenwell.<br>
<br>There is considerable evidence for Pope's adherence to the Roman Catholic religion, yet no suggestion that his role in or his profit from the Reformation ever troubled his conscience. Although very much part of Henry VIII's establishment, he was not offered a part in the administration of Edward VI. On the accession of Mary, however, he was appointed a privy councillor and entered into the most active part of his career. In the first year of Mary's reign Pope was deputed to arrest Lord Russell, to remain in London and victual the Tower in the queen's absence, and to examine those involved in Northumberland's rebellion. Mary's confidence was such that in 1556 she entrusted the Princess Elizabeth to his guardianship at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire. Pope showed appropriate kindness and respect, and deftly managed communications when Eric of Sweden proposed marriage to Elizabeth.<br>
<br>The apogee of the <i>novus homo</i> is the creation of an everlasting memorial. The foundation of Trinity College, Oxford, meant much to Pope. The college would be a real contribution to society and a fitting home for the cycle of obits which were to be celebrated for the souls of all whom he loved. The considerable personal prestige and recognition offered by the project was a bonus. On 20 February 1555 he purchased the site of the former Benedictine Durham College which lay outside Oxford's northern wall. Royal licence was granted on 8 March, and on 28 March 1555 Pope issued his foundation charter and delivered seisin in person. There was to be a president, twelve fellows, and, eventually, twelve scholars. The material endowment was comprehensive and practical, even to chains for the library books, but the main emphasis was on plate and vestments for the chapel. Sentiment can be detected in the choice of manors and land to be given to the college on 25 March 1556. The most valuable manor was Pope's first major acquisition, Wroxton in Oxfordshire, which was let on a long lease to his brother.<br>
<br>Pope certainly enjoyed having his own college, taking great pains over the statutes and keeping the Princess Elizabeth informed of progress. He enrolled various family members as fellows, scholars, and undergraduates. He wrote enthusiastically to the first president, Thomas Slythurst, a learned man and a devout Catholic, and a frequent guest at Clerkenwell and Tyttenhanger. Another correspondent was Arthur Yeldard, himself a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Pope's, trusted with the tuition of the founder's inattentive stepson John Basford. And with practical foresight Pope left money for the erection of a quadrangular building at Garsington (the presidential living) to accommodate the college in plague years. It was eminently satisfying to be the founder of a college.<br>
<br>However, it was not to last. Thomas Pope died on 29 January 1559 at his house in Clerkenwell, victim of a fever epidemic. He had made his will six weeks before, with many generous bequests to individuals and institutions. His funeral was fittingly splendid, and, according to his instructions, he was laid to rest beside his beloved Margaret and Alice at St Stephen Walbrook on 6 February. But he did not rest undisturbed. His widow Elizabeth married the distinguished military commander <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21619/', "Sir Hugh Paulet")</script>. With him she maintained a close interest in the life of the young college, styling herself foundress and doing much to consolidate a somewhat insecure financial position. A shrewd judge of posterity, in 1567 she had the bodies of both Thomas and Margaret Pope removed to a tomb in Trinity College chapel, beneath life-sized alabaster effigies of Thomas and herself. Elizabeth died on 27 October 1593, and she too was laid in the tomb she had thus prepared. In 1691 the medieval building was demolished and the tomb reverentially incorporated into the design of the new chapel. The church of St Stephen Walbrook, however, was utterly destroyed in the great fire of London in 1666.<br>
<br>There is a single contemporary portrait of Thomas Pope, traditionally ascribed to Holbein, perhaps by Stretes. Kept at Wroxton Abbey, property of the descendants of Pope's brother, John, it was purchased by Trinity College in 1930. Pope's face is somewhat fleshy, calm, and comfortable with life. The expression is inscrutable. Thomas Pope left little record of his own inner thoughts and feelings. His faith was private. His personal motto was that inherited by Trinity College: <i>quod tacitum velis nemini dixeris</i> (&#145;tell your secrets to no-one&#146;).<br>
