</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pitman, Sir  Isaac</span>  (1813&#150;1897), <span class="occ">deviser of a system of shorthand writing</span>, was born on 4 January 1813 at 3&#150;4 Timbrell Street, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, the third of the eleven children of Samuel Pitman (1787&#150;1863), manager of a weaving mill, and his wife, Maria Pitman, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davis (1784&#150;1854).<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeeducationandreligiousbeliefs"></a>Early life, education, and religious beliefs</h2>Pitman's father was a well-read man with a lively interest in social reform, and he helped to establish schools at Trowbridge, as well as a workers' library in the mill which he managed. Isaac Pitman duly attended one of these schools, but left at the early age of twelve after suffering several fainting fits. These were attributed to the crowded conditions and poor ventilation, but may have had a psychological cause. On leaving school Pitman was put to work in the mill office, and he transferred, after about three years, to similar work when his father started weaving on his own account. His premises, first at Trowbridge Down, Trowbridge, and then at Silver Street, Trowbridge, combined domestic accommodation and weaving rooms on a single site.<br>
<br>To compensate for his meagre schooling, Pitman studied independently, and some of the books that he read at this time had a formative influence on his career. Of particular relevance was John Walker's <span class="italic">Critical Pronouncing Dictionary</span> (1791), which achieved its aim by supplementing orthography with diacritics, and William Harding's <span class="italic">Universal Stenography</span> (1823), which was based on Samuel Taylor's <span class="italic">Essay Intended to Establish a Standard for an Universal System of Stenography</span> (1786). They sensitized Pitman to the vagaries and redundancies of English orthography, and to the consistency and economy offered by phonetic (or phonemic) spelling. In 1831 he was sent to London, to the Borough Road Teacher Training College, where he received five months' training as a teacher before being put in charge of a new elementary school at Barton-on-Humber, Lincolnshire, at the start of 1832. A feature of his teaching was his use of a flute to help pupils sing multiplication tables and to pipe them home through the streets at the end of each school day. He introduced his more advanced pupils to Taylor's shorthand, and he started to see the potential of simplified spelling like Taylor's as an aid to universal literacy.<br>
<br>Pitman's complex and difficult personality led to troubled relationships on various fronts, however. He wrangled with the school committee about the level of his pay, and with his family about how their souls could be saved. Brought up in the Baptist and Anglican traditions, he had become, on settling in Barton-on-Humber, a zealous adherent of Wesleyanism, preaching and writing tracts in its cause (and addressing some of the latter to his family in Trowbridge). About 1834 Pitman was befriended by a well-to-do widow, Mrs Mary Holgate (<i>d</i>. 1857), who seems to have pitied the lean and hungry look which resulted from his fasting and other self-imposed rigours. There is little sign that their marriage on 5 January 1835 tempered his fanaticism, and he continued the habit, begun in his teens, of greatly extending his working day with systematic and detailed study, the <span class="roman">Bible</span> being his new and consuming preoccupation.<br>
<br>At the start of 1836 Pitman moved to Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire, and once again took charge of a newly founded elementary school. Having found a house in Orchard Street, he was joined by his wife and then by his brother Benjamin, who helped with the school. However, his growing and unconcealed adherence to the teachings of the New (or Swedenborgian) Church in preference to those of Wesleyanism outraged the school committee, which was dominated by Calvinists. They therefore dismissed him at the end of the year, and for the next two and a half years he ran a competing school.<h2>
<a name="Pitmansshorthandsystem"></a>Pitman's shorthand system</h2>In the spring of 1837 Pitman devised an edition of Taylor's system of shorthand designed to be sold so cheaply as to make it widely affordable, but Samuel Bagster, the publisher to whom he submitted it, replied that a newly devised system would command better sales. Pitman bridled at Bagster's view, and informed him in a letter dated 16 June that the &#145;fundamental principles&#146; of Taylor's system could not be improved. Even so, he and his brother Joseph exchanged several letters in which they discussed and tested systems freshly improvised by themselves. The most notable among these was Pitman's letter of 5 July, in which he told Joseph:<blockquote>I have contrived a very good alphabet &hellip; In sending you this scheme, I do not send it as a <i>whim</i>, but as a scientific work, which, I think, will stand the test of years. Most of the schemes I have sent have been conceived and at the same time written to you. Consequently they could not be good enough. (M. Abercrombie, 53)</blockquote>Pitman immediately prepared an edition of this system for publication under the title <span class="italic">Stenographic Sound-Hand</span>. Each of the 3000 copies consisted of twelve letterpress pages printed by Samuel Bagster in London, and two plates of characters and illustrations drawn by Pitman and lithographed in Bristol&#151;the cutting, collation, and stitching being undertaken by Pitman's pupils and two of his brothers. Bagster took half the copies for sale at his London shop, while Pitman tried to distribute the rest, the accepted date of publication being 15 November 1837.<br>
<br>Pitman's system had many merits. In place of the letters of the alphabet, with their need for recursive strokes of the pen, it used a simple repertoire of dashes and curves (for the consonants) and dots and pecks (for the vowel sounds), which the writer could make with the greatest ease. Moreover, by using the symbols phonetically to match the distinctive sounds of speech, the system aimed to circumvent the obstacles presented by English orthography (though some phonological misunderstandings weakened its effectiveness). The system had patterns that reflected those of articulation. For example, it used a straight line to represent plosive consonants, the line being set at various angles to distinguish points of articulation and lightly or heavily written according to the absence or the presence of voice. In a similar way the vowel signs were positioned with respect to the consonant signs to reflect the closeness of the tongue to the palate when making the sounds. (This was known as &#145;the vowel scale&#146;.) The vowel markings could be omitted at the writer's discretion, thus permitting considerable gains in speed. The system was further streamlined by the use of single signs to denote certain consonant pairs (such as the &#145;tr&#146; in &#145;trend&#146;).<h2>
<a name="Characterandsecondmarriage"></a>Character and second marriage</h2>As suggested by the letter to Joseph quoted above, Pitman was a compulsive worker, driven by haste. A letter written to another brother, Benjamin (&#145;Ben(n)&#146;), a few years later, confirms the same trait:<blockquote>My plan is to answer every letter <i>before</i> I read it. That is, I begin to answer it as I begin to read it and perhaps before I have read half a dozen lines I have written 12. Then, as I go on reading, ideas pop into my mind and as fast as they pop in I whip them &hellip; on[to] the paper. (M. Abercrombie, 87)</blockquote>Fittingly the inventor of a system designed to maximize speed, Pitman once commended it with the simple claim that &#145;Time saved is life gained&#146;. However, he also saw his system in a quasi-mystical light, claiming that under its &#145;fostering sun &hellip; friendships grow six times as fast as under the withering blighting influence of the moon of longhand&#146;  (ibid., 101).<br>
<br>These feelings may be linked to Pitman's love for Martha Watts, a very young woman who lived in his household from about May 1838 to May 1839, ostensibly as Mrs Pitman's companion. After her departure she and Pitman pursued a secret relationship, with occasional meetings and copious correspondence using his system of shorthand, which Mrs Pitman could not read. However, after two or three years of increasing suspicion she took a bundle of Watts's letters from Pitman's desk and had some incriminating portions transcribed by one of his pupils. By this time (1842) the Pitmans had moved to Nelson Place, Bath, partly in the forlorn hope that a new school venture might succeed, and partly so that Pitman could be near fellow Swedenborgians. Armed with the letters, Mrs Pitman brought him before the church elders, whose warnings to Pitman failed to end either his correspondence with Martha Watts or the very rare meetings by which they kept their love alive in hope of Pitman's &#145;external release&#146;. However, on Mrs Pitman's death in 1857 they did not marry, and four years later, on 21 April 1861, Pitman made an unhappy marriage to Isabella Masters, the 37-year-old daughter of a &#145;master housepainter&#146;. Their two sons, Alfred and Ernest, are Pitman's only known children.<h2>
<a name="RefinementstoPitmanssystemanditsimpact"></a>Refinements to Pitman's system and its impact</h2>The production of some twenty editions of his system spanned Pitman's sixty-year career. The second, entitled <span class="italic">Phonography, or, Writing by Sound, being also a New and Natural System of Short-Hand</span>, appeared on 10 January 1840, to coincide with the introduction of the penny post, which assisted the distribution both of the publication and of the copious shorthand correspondence which increasingly linked the system's users. The term &#145;phonography&#146;, which Pitman coined in 1839 from the Greek words <i>ph&#333;n&#275;</i> (sound or voice) and <i>graph&#275;</i> (writing), became his unofficial trade mark, featuring in the varying titles of later editions. (It had, in fact, been used once before, in 1701.) There was little scope to develop the basic concepts underlying Pitman's system, and the new editions entailed a constant tinkering with its details, as well as some real improvements in its presentation. The earliest changes, including an alteration to the slope of the &#145;b&#146; and &#145;p&#146; signs and a rearrangement of the order in which the signs appeared, were the most worthwhile and practicable. However, a rapid growth in the number of users meant that later changes were sometimes divisive, particularly when they contravened existing and well-tried practices. The clearest and most damaging instance was the reversal of the vowel scale introduced (with no real effort at justification) in the tenth edition (1857). American users, led by Pitman's brother Benn, insisted on making the ninth edition of the system their standard, and Pitman's following therefore suffered a serious schism.<br>
<br>Pitman faced claims that his system was not as original as he maintained. In a speech delivered in Birmingham in 1843 he defended himself:<blockquote>so far as this, that I knew nothing of an attempt to write by sound having been made by any one else till three years after I had published &hellip; &#145;Stenographic sound-hand&#146;. I then met with the work of Mr. George Edmonds, of this town, aiming at the same object. I have since seen several others. (Baker, 79)</blockquote>Pitman, more than he realized, was a man of his times, responding to current circumstances by constructing a system heavily indebted to others' ideas. Thus he added vowels to consonant signs in accordance with the Hebrew practice noted by many <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholars; he adopted John Walker's analysis of English phonology; and he borrowed his brother Joseph's idea of using a single sign for consonant pairs. (Only in the last of these instances did he neglect to make an acknowledgement which was clearly due.) These and many other debts by no means nullify Pitman's achievement. Having devised a coherent system he worked with almost fanatical zeal to make it known throughout Britain and other parts of the world, its phonetic basis permitting its use for languages including Malagasy and Malay. In the early years he led four of his five surviving brothers, along with other enthusiasts, in a fervent campaign of public speaking which embraced most of England and southern Scotland. Correspondence circles, often involving gratuitous teaching, enabled the movement to grow exponentially, as did Pitman's prolific output of publications. (In 1845 he set up a printing press at his home.)<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>By this time Pitman had started to experiment with phonotypy (printing with phonetic type). He could not use his shorthand characters, partly because the range of forms made casting impracticable. In uneasy alliance with the phonetician Alexander John Ellis he began to experiment with founts adapted from the standard alphabet, printing works as diverse as Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> and parts of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the Mikmak language spoken by native people in Nova Scotia, which thus acquired a written form. By the end of 1874 Pitman had fully established himself as an editor, printer, and publisher on an industrial scale; his steam-powered operation near the centre of Bath bore many similarities to the weaving mills of his childhood and youth. In 1886 he took his sons into partnership, founding the firm known as Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons. Its phonographic and phonotypic publications were supplemented by others in a reformed English spelling which used the standard alphabet, signalling Pitman's recognition that his radical reform might not succeed. (His descendant Sir James Pitman revived some vestige of it in his &#145;initial teaching alphabet&#146;.)<br>
<br>Although mellowed by age, Pitman remained abstemious in every way, fiercely committed to vegetarianism and very hostile to smoking and drinking. From his mid-twenties he was a loyal adherent of the New Church, and sometimes provoked complaints by including its literature in his mailings. A resident of Bath for fifty-eight years, he died there at his home, 17 Royal Crescent, on 22 January 1897, of heart disease and the general effects of old age. His death certificate gives his name as &#145;Sir Isaac Pitman&#146;&#151;he had been knighted three years earlier&#151;and his occupation as &#145;Inventor of Phonography&#146;. His funeral ceremony (at New Church, Henry Street, Bath) and cremation (at Woking, Surrey) were on 27 January 1897.<br>
<br>Pitman was not a thinker, and his contribution to linguistic science consisted in the stimulus he gave to a rising generation of phoneticians. After his death, significant improvements in his shorthand system made it a useful tool of twentieth-century commerce, though its use declined with the advent of new technologies. According to Baker, Pitman admitted &#145;I do not study, I only work&#146;. This sums up both his limitation and his strength.<br>
