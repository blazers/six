<span class="headword">Arrowsmith,  Aaron, the elder</span>  (1750&#150;1823), <span class="occ">cartographer and map publisher</span>, was born on 14 July 1750 at Winston, co. Durham, the son of John and Mary Arrowsmith. His father died when Aaron was young and his mother then married a wastrel who reduced the family fortune. Aaron may have been taught mathematics by William Emerson, then also living in co. Durham, who was interested in applied mathematics. From 1770 onwards Arrowsmith lived in London, and on 26 March 1780 married Catherine Sophia Palmer (<i>d</i>. 1801), with whom he had at least seven daughters, and one son who did not survive to adulthood.<br>
<br>In 1782 Arrowsmith surveyed the great post roads between London and Falmouth; the results of his work were engraved and published by John Cary and it seems likely that he trained with Cary from the time of his arrival in London. By 1786 he had set up on his own at Castle Street, Long Acre, and he established his reputation in 1790 with his eleven-sheet world map on Mercator's projection, the first of several multiple-sheet maps for which he was to become famous. This was followed in 1795 by his great map of Canada, which typified his high standards. All doubtful information was excluded and instead information from the Hudson's Bay Company, the Admiralty, and private individuals was combined for the first time to give the most accurate map possible. As more data became available the Canadian map plates were changed numerous times by Arrowsmith himself and each of his three successors, who all prided themselves on using only the most up-to-date information. Arrowsmith was soon recognized in Britain and abroad as a cartographer of outstanding accuracy and skill and was accorded the title of hydrographer to the prince regent about 1810 and that of hydrographer to the king in 1820. His maps were in great demand by official bodies such as the Admiralty and, more surprisingly given their great size and hence cost, with the public as well. In 1807 he published his map of Scotland, based on the military survey of Scotland of 1745&#150;55 and of particular interest for the accompanying <span class="italic">Memoir</span> (1809) in which he described how he constructed the map. His last major work was his map of India (1822). He engraved and printed many of his own maps and all of those produced in his shop (at 10 Soho Square from 1814) were noted for the functional beauty and simplicity with which they were engraved. He died at Soho Square on 23 April 1823 and was buried at St Anne's Church, Soho Square.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife Arrowsmith married Sarah Hare (<i>d</i>. 1824) on 2 July 1801 at St Marylebone. They had at least two daughters and two sons, Aaron the younger and <a href="#cosubject_46711">Samuel [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and it was to these two sons that he left his business in his will of 16 January 1822. <a name="cosubject_46710"></a><span class="headword">Aaron Arrowsmith the younger</span>  (1802&#150;1854)<span class="occ"></span>, born in London on 21 May 1802, was trained by his father. He printed maps from his father's plates and produced his own, of which none equalled the standards set by his father. None the less he was accorded the title of hydrographer to the king. He was a founder fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1830, but, his interest in geography waning, in 1833 he resigned from the society and in 1834 he handed the map business to Samuel. He then went to Magdalen Hall, Oxford, taking his BA in 1836 and MA in 1839 before taking holy orders. His only known clerical post was that of curate at Kidlington, Oxfordshire, in 1842. As a clergyman he compiled several geographical textbooks, dictionaries, and maps, including a <span class="roman">Bible</span> atlas, published under his brother Samuel's name. He died on 26 April 1854 at Whitchurch, Shropshire. The map business continued in the hands of <a name="cosubject_46711"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Arrowsmith</span>  (1805&#150;1839)<span class="occ"></span> whose maps, like his brother's, were competent but unremarkable. He was elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1832 and was hydrographer to the king. He produced maps mainly of Britain, including many for parliamentary purposes, while his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/701/', "John Arrowsmith (1790&#150;1873)")</script> specialized in maps of foreign countries in his independent map establishment. Samuel married Caroline Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1838) on 9 April 1835 and they had at least one child, Aaron, baptized on 19 August 1836. Samuel ran the business until his death on 30 August 1839 when it passed into the hands of his cousin John.<br>
