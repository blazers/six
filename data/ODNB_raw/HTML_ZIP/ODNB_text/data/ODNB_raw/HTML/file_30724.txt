<span class="headword">Bergne, Sir  John Henry Gibbs</span>  (1842&#150;1908), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born at 19 Hans Place, London, on 12 August 1842, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2202/', "John Brodribb Bergne (1800&#150;1873)")</script>, Foreign Office clerk, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbs. He was descended from a French family originally resident in Auvergne, which settled in England after the French Revolution. Educated at schools at Brighton and Enfield and at London University, where he graduated BA, he followed his father by entering the Foreign Office as a clerk in the diplomatic establishment after passing a competitive examination in 1861; he was appointed an assistant clerk in 1880, and promoted to be superintendent of the treaty department in 1881, an office in which he continued until 1894, when he became superintendent of the commercial department and examiner of treaties. He held this position for eight years, doing much valuable work in the development of the commercial department and particularly in the arrangement of its relations with the Board of Trade, and in introducing a more regular and complete system of reports on commercial and industrial subjects from diplomatic and consular officers in foreign countries. He was occasionally employed abroad on business which came within the sphere of his permanent work, and on which he possessed special knowledge. In 1875 he assisted the British agent before the international commission, which sat under article 22 of the treaty of Washington, to assess the amount to be paid by the United States to Great Britain in return for the fishery privileges accorded to the citizens of the United States under article 18 of that treaty; when the commission met at Halifax in 1877 he acted as secretary and protocolist to it. In September 1887 he was appointed secretary to Joseph Chamberlain's special mission to Washington to adjust certain questions relating to the North American fisheries. For his services he was made KCMG in 1888, having been made CMG in 1886.<br>
<br>In 1885 Bergne was second British delegate at the international copyright conference held at Bern, and signed the convention which was agreed there (9 September 1886). While at Washington in 1887 he was deputed to discuss the copyright question with the United States department of state. In May 1896, as British delegate to a conference at Paris, he signed the additional act to the international copyright convention of 1886. He was appointed a member of the departmental committee on trade marks in 1888, and was sent as British delegate to the conference on industrial property held at Rome in 1888, at Madrid in 1890, and at Brussels in November 1897 and again in 1900. From 1898 onwards he was constantly employed in the negotiations for the abolition of bounties on the export of sugar, and was one of the British delegates at the conferences held in Brussels on this question in 1899 and 1901; on 5 March 1902 he signed the convention concluded on the latter occasion. In 1903 he was appointed the British delegate on the permanent commission established under article 7 of that convention, and attended the various meetings of the commission, furnishing reports which were laid before parliament and which were marked by his usual power of terse, lucid explanation. He served as a member on the royal commission for the Paris Exhibition of 1900. He retired from the Foreign Office on a pension on 1 October 1902, but his employment on the special subjects of which he had an intimate knowledge continued. He was made CB in 1902 and KCB in the following year. In November 1908 he served as British delegate at the international copyright conference at Berlin.<br>
<br>Though scarcely an author in the ordinary sense of the term, Bergne rendered important services to the Society of Authors, of which he became a member in 1890; after his retirement from the Foreign Office he served on the committee of management and copyright subcommittee, and acted as chairman of the general committee (1905&#150;7). He contributed articles on diplomatic topics to the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and other periodicals. He was also an accomplished mountaineer and well-known member of the Alpine Club from 1878 until his death, and a collector of oriental china.<br>
<br>Bergne married, in 1878, Mary &agrave; Court, daughter of the Revd S. B. Bergne; they had two sons, the elder of whom was killed in an accident near Saas Fee in Switzerland in January 1908. Bergne died of a chill at the Hotel Continental, Berlin, on 15 November 1908. His wife survived him.<br>
