<span class="headword">Magnus <span class="st"> [<em>later </em> Magnus-Allcroft]</span>, Sir  Philip Montefiore</span>, second baronet  (1906&#150;1988), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at 8 Craven Hill Gardens, London, on 8 February 1906. He was the eldest child of the two sons and three daughters of Laurie Magnus (1872&#150;1933), publisher and a director of Routledge, and his wife, Dora Marian Spielman (1882?&#150;1972), eldest daughter of Sir Isidore Spielman and granddaughter of Sir Joseph Sebag-Montefiore. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40870/', "Sir Philip Magnus, first baronet (1842&#150;1933)")</script>, the educationist. The family was prominent in public and Jewish life in London. Magnus was educated at Westminster School and Wadham College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1928 with a second class in modern history. At Oxford, he was &#145;a popular figure, almost a dandy, given to wearing top hats&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Dec 1988). In 1928 he entered the civil service as an assistant principal in the office of works and then the Board of Education, but the death of first his father and then his grandfather meant that in 1933 he inherited the title from the latter. He resigned from the civil service and began literary work, in 1939 publishing a life of Edmund Burke. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Artillery and the intelligence corps, ending with the rank of major. On 14 July 1943 in Onibury parish church in an Anglican service he married Jewell Allcroft (<i>b</i>. 1907) of Stokesay Court, Onibury, Craven Arms, Shropshire, daughter of the late Herbert John Allcroft, gentleman, and his wife, Margaret Jane Russell (later Mrs John Rotton). They had no children. His wife's home became his own for the rest of his life. In 1951 by deed poll he added the name of Allcroft to his own and his domestic habits became those of an Anglican squire.<br>
<br>After the war, Magnus returned to the civil service as a principal in the Ministry of Town and Country Planning, but again retired from it in 1951, in which year he published a life of Sir Walter Raleigh (rev. edns 1956, 1968). Magnus's success as a biographer began with his <span class="italic">Gladstone</span> (1954). This was based on the huge collection of Gladstone papers at Hawarden, which he was the first to use extensively, as well as the collection in the British Museum. Magnus was the first to give details of Gladstone's &#145;rescue work&#146; with prostitutes, which he charitably described as innocent. The biography was an important work in the rehabilitation of interest in the Victorians, and was written in a markedly different tone from that of Lytton Strachey's <span class="italic">Eminent Victorians</span> (1918). Magnus took Gladstone seriously, but not very seriously, and his book was an effective combination of research and readability. Magnus did not have access to Gladstone's diaries and their ancillary papers, but he seemed to some a natural choice to be invited to edit them. However, Archbishop Fisher, who owned the diaries, was swayed by objections from A. Tilney Bassett, the Gladstones' archivist, who felt that Magnus's biography had been too flippant.<br>
<br>On the strength of his <span class="italic">Gladstone</span>, which over the years sold almost 50,000 copies, and his biography of Kitchener (1958, selling 12,000 copies, revised edn 1968), Magnus was invited to give the prestigious Ford lectures at Oxford. He accepted, but, alarmed by A. L. Rowse, who warned him that he would be &#145;torn to pieces by third-rate dons&#146;, withdrew early in 1961 just as the titles of the lectures were due to be published. Instead, he published a life, <span class="italic">Edward VII</span> (1964), a fine work of research in the Royal Archives and one of the best of royal lives. It set a new standard with a new tone&#151;scholarly and amusing but not republican&#151;for such works and sold well: over 20,000 copies. He was asked, but declined, to write a life of Wellington, the task then falling to Elizabeth Longford. Poor eyesight made the reading of Victorian handwriting difficult, and in his later years Magnus could hardly read or write at all. With Elizabeth Longford and Janet Adam Smith, Magnus was the best of those who write in the tricky area of the well-researched biography which bridges the popular and the academic.<br>
<br>Magnus was an active Salopian, serving as a JP, county councillor, and alderman, and chairman of the planning committee, 1962&#150;74, and of the records committee; he was chairman of the governors of Attingham College and was governor of Ludlow grammar school, 1952&#150;77. Nationally, he was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, 1970&#150;77, and was, his fellow trustee Elizabeth Longford recalled, &#145;a natural public servant&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 23 Dec 1988). Magnus died from myocardial infarction at Stokesay Court on 21 December 1988, his wife surviving him. His body was cremated. The title passed to his nephew, Laurence Henry Philip Magnus (<i>b</i>. 1955).<br>
