<span class="headword">Stowell,  William Hendry</span>  (1800&#150;1858), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and college head</span>, born at Douglas, Isle of Man, on 19 June 1800, was the son of William Stowell and his wife, Susan Hilton. The evangelical clergyman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26614/', "Hugh Stowell")</script> was his cousin. He was one of the first students at Blackburn Independent Academy, opened in 1816 to train candidates for the ministry. In July 1821, shortly after taking up his first ministerial charge, at St Andrew's Chapel, North Shields, he married Sarah Hilton.<br>
<br>In 1834 Stowell was appointed head of Rotherham Independent college and pastor of Masborough Congregational Church. In 1848 he was pioneer of the &#145;missions to working men&#146;, and he took a prominent part in the success of the concert-hall lectures established by Nathaniel Caine at Liverpool in 1850. He left Rotherham in October 1850 when he was appointed president of Cheshunt College, but he was forced to resign in 1856 having antagonized the students by his approach to discipline.<br>
<br>Stowell was the author of several theological works, in recognition of which the University of Glasgow conferred the degree of DD on him in 1849. Among these works were <span class="italic">The Ten Commandments Illustrated</span> (1824), <span class="italic">The Miraculous Gifts Considered</span> (1834), and a <span class="italic">History of the Puritans</span> (1847). He also edited the works of the puritan divine Thomas Adams, and was joint editor of the fifth series of the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span> and a contributor to the <span class="italic">British Quarterly Review</span>. He also wrote several volumes for the monthly series of the Religious Tract Society, including lives of Muhammad, Julius Caesar, and Isaac Newton.<br>
<br>Stowell died at his residence, 10 Roman Road, Barnsbury, London, on 2 January 1858. His eldest son, William, published a volume of his sermons with a memoir in the following year.<br>
