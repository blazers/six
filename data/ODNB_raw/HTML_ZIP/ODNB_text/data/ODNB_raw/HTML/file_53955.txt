<span class="headword">Gordon,  George</span>  (1801&#150;1893), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and naturalist</span>, was born on 23 July 1801 at the manse of Urquhart, Moray, the first son of William Gordon (<i>bap</i>. 1744, <i>d</i>. 1810), minister in the Church of Scotland, and his wife, Margaret (1779&#150;1864), daughter of Joseph Anderson, minister of the Church of Scotland at Birnie, Moray, and his wife, Jean Craig. Gordon's father's family was of the minor gentry, being a cadet branch of the Gordons of Beldornie. Gordon attended Elgin Academy for some years. He proceeded to Marischal College, Aberdeen, at the age of fourteen and graduated AM in 1819. During his twenties he spent time in Edinburgh attending some of the scientific classes at the university, starting with natural history in 1821 and ending with geology and botany in 1829. He returned to Moray and was given the living of Birnie, 3 miles south of Elgin, in November 1832. He married Anna Stephen (<i>c</i>.1813&#150;1889) on 20 March 1834; they had eight children.<br>
<br>Gordon became a champion of Moray. His interest was in the scientific and antiquarian aspects of a province which, to him, included the lands between the rivers Spey in the east and Beauly in the west. Initially botany took up his leisure time. Fresh from his botanical classes in Edinburgh under Graham in 1828 and 1829, he set about compiling <span class="italic">Collectanea for a Flora of Moray</span>, which he completed in 1839. He and his friends scoured the countryside, making the first records for most of the area and adding <i>Pinguicula alpina</i>, the alpine butterwort (now extinct), to the British flora.<br>
<br>A particular friend was William Alexander Stables of Cawdor, near Nairn. Together Gordon and Stables made many contributions to the early records of northern Britain, as can be seen from H. C. Watson's <span class="italic">New Botanist's Guide</span> (1835&#150;7). In the 1840s Gordon set about recording the fauna of Moray, beginning with the vertebrates&#151;mammals, birds, and fishes&#151;then the invertebrates&#151;crustacea, echinodermata, mollusca, and lepidoptera. Most of his findings were published in the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s in a series of articles for <span class="italic">The Zoologist</span>. The work needed to compile these lists was supported by a large network of friends, both professional and amateur. Gordon's time in Edinburgh had left him with widespread contacts that he drew upon throughout his long life. An archive of his scientific correspondence in Elgin Museum records the quest for information, the lending of books and papers, and the support freely given to those less well informed. There are letters from more than 200 correspondents including William Hooker, Roderick Murchison, Charles Darwin, T. H. Huxley, and other eminent scientists of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>The geology of Moray proved to be of particular importance to scientists. Fossil fish had been found in its sandstones by Gordon and his friends in the 1830s. Partly as a result of the fossil collection, the Elgin and Moray Scientific Association (now the Moray Society) was formed in 1836 with Gordon as a founder member; this association built the Elgin Museum in 1843. Consternation was caused in geological circles when fossils of reptiles turned up in the sandstones which had always been considered to belong to the Old Red Sandstone formations of about 400 million to 360 million years ago. The controversy regarding the age of the sandstones of Moray continued throughout the nineteenth century; indeed, their geology is not fully understood, even today. The Carboniferous period, which is usually found between the Old Red (Devonian) Sandstone and the New Red (Permian and Triassic) Sandstone, is missing in Moray and the two periods of sandstones, although separated by over 100 million years, look remarkably similar. Gordon never accepted that the reptile-bearing sandstones were of New Red Sandstone age but he worked hard so that the truth might be discovered. Many cases of rock were sent south for Huxley to research. Geologists continuously visited Moray and were given the benefit of Gordon's sound knowledge of the area. His dedicated work on the geology of Moray was rewarded in 1859 with an LLD from Marischal College.<br>
<br>In the great controversy over patronage that resulted in the Disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843, Gordon was of the moderate party that supported the <i>status quo</i>. In 1859 he became directly involved in the long running &#145;Elgin Academy Case&#146; in which the presbytery of Elgin successfully defended the right of the Church of Scotland to appoint teachers and to inspect the burgh schools.<br>
<br>Gordon remained active in science up to his death, which occurred at his home, Braebirnie, Mayne Road, Elgin, due to cardiac failure on 12 December 1893. He was buried at Birnie kirk on 16 December. Gordon's scientific collections and lists are important, but he made two other contributions to nineteenth-century science: wishing to share all his knowledge with anyone who was interested in Moray, he sought to draw the attention of great scientists to its uniqueness; and he understood that his scientific letters were of value for posterity&#151;he sorted them himself and fortunately his family gave them the care they merited. In these two ways he achieved his ambition of promoting Moray as a place of special interest to the naturalist, the geologist, and the archaeologist.<br>
