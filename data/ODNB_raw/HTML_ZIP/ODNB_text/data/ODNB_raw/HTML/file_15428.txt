<span class="headword">Kenton,  Benjamin</span>  (1719&#150;1800), <span class="occ">wine merchant and philanthropist</span>, was born on 19 November 1719 at Fieldgate Street, Whitechapel, London, the son of Benjamin Kenton and his wife, Mary, who kept a small greengrocer's shop. He was educated at the parish charity school and at fifteen he was apprenticed to the landlord of the Angel and Crown inn, Whitechapel. In 1741 he became waiter and drawer at the Crown and Magpie in Aldgate, an inn frequented by sea-captains whose vessels berthed on the Thames. The owner had discovered the technique of bottling beer so that it withstood the high temperatures and rough passage around the Cape, and had built up a substantial export trade. The inn was also famous for its sign of a stone crown surmounted by a magpie carved in pear wood. When the landlord removed the magpie and changed the name of his beer to Crown Beer, the quality is said to have suffered. The loss of the magpie was blamed and trade declined.<br>
<br>Kenton, however, was popular with the seamen. A witty and attentive waiter, contemporaries recalled how he kept two candles constantly burning on the bar to remind him that as they dimmed he needed to attend to every candle in the house. When the owner died, the customers put up the capital for Kenton to take over as landlord. His first task was to restore the magpie and, with it, the inn's reputation. Kenton prospered, and in 1765 moved to new premises in the Minories, where he quickly established himself as a wine merchant. With expert financial guidance from his banker friend, Thomas Harley (1730&#150;1804), alderman of Portsoken ward, his business profits were transformed into a considerable fortune.<br>
<br>Kenton was an active member of the Vintners' Company; in 1768 he was elected to its court and, in 1776, to the position of master. He donated &pound;4250 to enlarge the company's almshouses at Mile End. A trustee of the Sir John Cass School and governor of the Foundling Hospital, he gave liberally to many charities, including the Whitechapel School where he was educated, and a number of other charity schools. He bequeathed &pound;20,000 to Hetherington's charity for the blind, and &pound;5000 each to St Bartholomew's, Christ's, and Bridewell hospitals.<br>
<br>Kenton was a man of solid proportions, with a slight inward squint. He was predeceased by his wife (whose name is not known), and by his children, including at least one son and a daughter. His son became an eminent druggist in Lawrence Lane, Cheapside, and died a wealthy man in his own right. His daughter died from tuberculosis before her intended marriage to David Pike Watts, her father's clerk. Kenton had opposed the engagement, but ultimately the men became close friends and Watts, as Kenton's main beneficiary, reputedly inherited almost &pound;300,000. Kenton died at his home in Gower Street on 25 May 1800 and was buried in St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. An annual sermon to commemorate his benefactions to the Vintners' Company was established, and a street near the Foundling Hospital was named after him.<br>
