<span class="headword">Wright, Sir  Denis Arthur Hepworth</span>  (1911&#150;2005), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in his paternal grandparents' house, 80 Durlston Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, on 23 March 1911, the elder son and eldest of four children of Arthur Edgar Wright (1880&#150;1949), assistant director of public works, Hong Kong, and his wife, Margery Hepworth <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chapman (1888&#150;1973). He spent nine years in Hong Kong, where he attended the Peak School, before returning to England with his parents in 1921. From Brentwood School, Essex (1921&#150;9), where, in his words, his sole distinction was a prize for &#145;Virtue, Learning and Manners&#146;  (Wright, 1.13), he went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, to read modern history, with financial support from his parents, his schoolmaster, an educational trust, and Essex county council. To learn to ride, he joined the cavalry squadron of the Oxford University officer training corps. He was a founder member of the Cosmopolitans, a small society for the discussion of international issues. He left Oxford in 1932 with a second-class degree in modern history.<br>
<br>Failing to win an eastern cadetship for the colonial service, Wright first took two ill-paid jobs in advertising and in 1936 joined Gallahers, the tobacco firm, at &pound;350 a year. He became engaged in 1938 to Iona Carmen, an artist, daughter of Granville Craig, and niece of Lord Craigavon, the first prime minister of Northern Ireland. They had met through the Labour Club at Oxford (though he described himself as a &#145;non-political animal&#146; Wright, 1.26). Wright travelled alone on holiday to Romania in August 1939. Reaching Constanta on the outbreak of war, he was immediately recruited by the British consulate. Iona joined him and they were married in the consulate at Galatz on the Danube on 10 November 1939. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1939&#150;40 Constanta was a hive of covert activity, including the smuggling out of &pound;20 million of Polish government gold, an abortive plan to block the Iron Gate gorge on the Danube, and spirited attempts to frustrate German activity. In 1940 Wright moved to the legation in Bucharest. When relations with Romania were broken in 1941, Wright was appointed vice-consul in Trebizond in north-east Turkey, a solitary post, with supplies short, communications slow, and little congenial company. The German advance into Russia raised the importance of the region and Wright made three difficult journeys into the hinterland to report on communications, earning a commendation from the embassy in Ankara. In May 1943 he became acting consul in Mersin, in south-eastern Turkey, an important port for supplies.<br>
<br>Returning to London in 1945, Wright took a job with the Ottoman Bank but soon resigned and joined the foreign service. His first posting was as first secretary (commercial) in Belgrade (1946&#150;8). His subsequent career followed a more conventional path, although he spent ten of his twenty-six years' service in one country, eight of them as ambassador, a rarity in the twentieth-century diplomatic service. In 1949 he was appointed superintending trade consul in Chicago, and in 1951 head of the economic relations department at the Foreign Office. In 1953 he was chosen to reopen the embassy in Tehran after the fall of Mossadeq, first as charg&eacute; d'affaires and later as counsellor. This marked a turning point in his life. He was appointed CMG in 1954. After serving from 1955 as an assistant under-secretary in the Foreign Office, he was appointed in 1959 ambassador to Ethiopia and in 1963, after a brief spell in the Foreign Office, to Iran, where he remained until his retirement from the diplomatic service in 1971. He was appointed KCMG in 1961 and GCMG on retirement.<br>
<br>Wright proved to be a model representative of his country. Completely straightforward, he displayed a gift for friendship without condescension and an ability to engender trust. A shrewd judge of character, a firm and fair disciplinarian, he won the respect and affection of his staff and of the expatriate British. He learned the local languages and spoke Farsi well. He and Iona toured widely in their various posts, by Landrover, horse, mule, or on foot, making a point everywhere of meeting the local population. He combined loyalty to his own government, albeit severely tested in 1956 by the Suez d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, with empathy with the people of the countries in which he served. This did not blind him to their faults. In his farewell dispatch from Addis Ababa he described Ethiopians as &#145;elusive, evasive, secretive and obstinate&#146;  (Wright, 2.361). After demonstrations in Iran in 1963, inspired largely by the religious community and suppressed with some bloodshed, he noted in his diary that the shah's weakness of character and judgement remained, and added prophetically: &#145;So long as the army and security forces remain loyal (and without them the Shah is doomed) &hellip; the country will probably tag along for some time&#146;  (ibid., 2.380).<br>
<br>The trust he established often enabled Wright to play a key part in furthering British interests. In Belgrade, after the break with Moscow, one Yugoslav official confided in Wright that the economic situation was desperate: if Britain valued Tito's survival, aid was essential. His report led to the reversal of British policy on aid. In Ethiopia in 1961, when the imperial guard mounted a coup, Wright's loyalist contacts turned to him to alert the emperor, who was absent in Brazil. The embassy provided a haven for the British community during the fighting. Most notably, from 1953 on, he established an unprecedentedly close but wary relationship with the shah of Iran. This contributed significantly to the success of the oil negotiations following the fall of Mossadeq in 1953. In 1959, while on holiday in Tehran, Wright was urged by an Iranian minister to see the shah to dissuade him from concluding a pact with the Soviet Union; and in 1969&#150;70 he was instrumental in persuading the shah to drop Iran's claim to Bahrain, subject to a test of opinion there by the UN secretary-general. He failed, however, to move the shah over claims to other smaller islands.<br>
<br>After his retirement from the diplomatic service Wright was approached by the British government in May 1979 to break to the shah, in exile at Nassau, that they &#145;could not for the moment &hellip; offer [him] asylum&#146;  (Wright, 3.40). Wright agreed on condition that his mission should be secret. Disguised and travelling on a false passport as Edward Wilson, born on 1 April, he saw the shah and brought him to &#145;understand and accept&#146; the decision  (ibid., 3.41). In 1980, in his last direct service to the government, Wright joined a group of observers of the Rhodesian elections that followed the Lancaster House agreement of the previous December.<br>
<br>In retirement in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, the Wrights kept open house for their many friends at their home, Duck Bottom. He became a director of several companies, including Shell, the Chartered (later Standard Chartered) Bank, and Mitchell Cotts (all 1971&#150;81). He was elected an honorary fellow of both St Edmund Hall (1972) and St Antony's College (1975), Oxford. He was chairman of the Iran Society (1976&#150;9; and president, 1989&#150;95), a member of the executive committee of the British Institute for Persian Studies (1973&#150;87; president, 1978&#150;87), a member of the executive committee of the Anglo-Ethiopian Society (1972&#150;7), and a governor of the Overseas Service College, Farnham Castle (1972&#150;86). In 1990 he was awarded the Sir Percy Sykes memorial medal by the Royal Society for Asian Affairs. He was additionally chairman or committee member of some smaller societies or charities, including in 1975 a campaigning group, Haddenham into Europe. He made several lecture tours of North America and India. During this time he made serious contributions to scholarship, notably with two important and admired books, <span class="italic">The English amongst the Persians</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">The Persians amongst the English</span> (1985). He contributed, jointly with James Morris and Roger Wood, to <span class="italic">Persia</span> (1969) and published a collection of essays, <span class="italic">Britain and Iran, 1790&#150;1980</span> (Iran Society, 2003). He died at his home in Haddenham, on 18 May 2005, of cancer of the prostate. His funeral took place on 2 June at St Mary's Church, Haddenham. He was survived by his wife, Iona. One of the most distinguished British diplomats of his generation, he remained endearingly modest about his abilities and achievements.<br>
