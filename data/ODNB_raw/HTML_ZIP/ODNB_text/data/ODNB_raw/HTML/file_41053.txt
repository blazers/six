<span class="headword">Hyde,  Edward</span>, third earl of Clarendon  (1661&#150;1723), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born on 28 November 1661, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14329/', "Henry Hyde, second earl of Clarendon (1638&#150;1709)")</script>, and his first wife, Theodosia (<i>bap</i>. 1640, <i>d</i>. 1662), daughter of Arthur, first Baron Capel. He was named after his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14328/', "Edward Hyde (1609&#150;1674)")</script>, lord high chancellor of England under Charles II, and took the title Viscount Cornbury in 1674. He was first cousin of Mary II and Queen Anne owing to the marriage of his aunt, Anne Hyde (1637&#150;1671), in 1660 to the duke of York, later James II.<br>
<br>Although he was enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford, at the age of thirteen, Cornbury's formal education took place primarily at the Acad&eacute;mie de Calvin in Geneva from 1680 to 1682. He was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Royal regiment of dragoons in 1683, and his valiant service at the battle of Sedgemoor during Monmouth's rebellion (1685) earned him a full colonelcy and command of the dragoons at the age of twenty-three. On 10 July 1688 he married Katherine O'Brien, Baroness Clifton of Leighton Bromswold (1673&#150;1706) on her mother's death in 1702, a descendant of the Irish earls of Thomond and the duke of Richmond and Lennox, yet with only distant financial prospects. The marriage produced two daughters and a son, who predeceased their father.<br>
<br>The revolution of 1688 broke Cornbury's allegiance to James II, as he was the first English officer to defect to the invading Prince William of Orange. His sturdy devotion to the Church of England was a leading motive, as was his connection to the protestant court of Princess Anne, where in 1685 he had been appointed master of the horse to Prince George. William of Orange vowed in 1688 never to forget the &#145;seasonable service&#146; of Cornbury's timely defection  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.213&#150;15). Yet, when in 1689 Clarendon and his son urged Anne's right of succession above William's, both William and Mary turned against them. As a nonjuror Clarendon received no offices, and Cornbury's regiment was taken from him. The family now confronted a time of financial distress from which it never fully recovered. Cornbury's sole office after 1690 was as MP for Wiltshire (1685&#150;7, 1690&#150;95) and for Christchurch (1695&#150;1701), where his fundamental loyalty to the crown soon became apparent.<br>
<br>In 1702 William appointed Cornbury governor-general of the royal colony of New York; later that year Queen Anne added the governorship of the newly royal colony of New Jersey. Well qualified for these posts by military experience and imperial allegiance, Cornbury strengthened the defences and political stability of New York. Fractious New Jersey, often beset by land disputes, was less easily tamed. An opposition party, led by gentleman landowner Lewis Morris, employed slander and Grub Street satire&#151;newly emergent in colonial politics&#151;to assail the governor's reputation for financial and moral integrity. Accused of venality, bigotry, and transvestism, Cornbury was replaced as governor in December 1708. After successfully defending his administration and reputation in England and succeeding to the title third earl of Clarendon (1709), he was sworn of the privy council, took a leading role in the House of Lords from 1710 to 1723, and in 1714 served as Queen Anne's envoy-extraordinary to the court at Hanover. He died on 31 March 1723 at Chelsea, Middlesex, and was interred in the family vault at Westminster Abbey on 5 April.<br>
