<span class="headword">Lane,  Theodore</span>  (<em>c.</em>1800&#150;1828), <span class="occ">painter and etcher</span>, is said to have been born at Isleworth, Middlesex, in 1800, but the statement is not confirmed by the parish register. His father, who came from Worcester, was a struggling drawing-master, and as a result Lane received little formal education. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to the miniature painter John Barrow of Weston Place, St Pancras.<br>
<br>Lane first came to notice as a painter of watercolour portraits and miniatures, and he exhibited four works of that class at the Royal Academy in 1819, 1820, and 1826. However, his talent was for humorous subjects, and a series of thirty-six subjects designed and etched by him, entitled <span class="italic">The Life of an Actor</span>, with a letterpress by Pierce Egan, was published in 1825. Lane also etched a number of sets of satirical and comic prints of sporting and social life, such as <span class="italic">The Masquerade at the Argyle Rooms</span>, <span class="italic">Scientific Pursuits, or, Hobby Horse Races to the Temple of Fame</span>, and <span class="italic">A Trip to Ascot Races</span>, a series of scenes on the road from Hyde Park Corner to Ascot Heath, which he dedicated to George IV in 1827. He also illustrated with etchings and woodcuts <span class="italic">A Complete Panorama of the Sporting World</span> and Egan's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of the Turf, the Chase, the Ring, and the Stage</span> (1827).<br>
<br>About 1825 Lane took up oil painting, and, with the help of Alexander Fraser, rapidly attained proficiency in the medium. In 1827 he exhibited <span class="italic">The Christmas Present, or, Disappointment</span>, at the Royal Academy, and <span class="italic">An Hour before the Duel</span> at the British Institution. The following year he showed <span class="italic">Disturbed by the Nightmare</span> at the Royal Academy, <span class="italic">Reading the Fifth Act of the Manuscript</span> at the British Institution, and <span class="italic">The Enthusiast</span> at the Society of British Artists. The humorous treatment of the subjects and their delicate finish attracted much attention.<br>
<br>Lane's promise was not to be fulfilled, however; his life was terminated by a freak accident. While waiting for a friend at the horse repository in Gray's Inn Road, he struck his head on a skylight and suffered a fatal fall. He died at his home, 79 Judd Street, Brunswick Square, London, on 21 May 1828 and was buried at St Pancras Old Church on 28 May. He left a widow and two children, for whose benefit his best-known work, <span class="italic">The Enthusiast</span> (Tate collection), representing a gouty angler fishing in a tub of water, was engraved by Robert Graves. The work was later purchased by Robert Vernon and engraved by Henry Beckwith for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> (1850). A work in oils, entitled <span class="italic">The Mathematician's Abstraction</span>, which was unfinished at his death, was completed by Fraser and purchased by Lord Northwick; it was engraved by H. Graves. In 1831 Egan published <span class="italic">The Show Folks</span>, illustrated with nine woodcuts designed by Lane. The text was accompanied by a detailed and humorous memoir of the artist, emphasizing a &#145;mild and peaceable&#146; character unaffected by the foibles of the theatrical and sporting worlds he depicted  (Egan, 50). Examples of his work are in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
