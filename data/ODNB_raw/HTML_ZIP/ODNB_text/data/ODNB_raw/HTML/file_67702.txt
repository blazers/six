<span class="headword">Ponder,  Nathaniel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Bunyan Ponder]</span>  (1640&#150;1699), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born at Rothwell, Northamptonshire, the son of John Ponder (<i>d</i>. 1665), and his wife, May Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1665). His professional commitment to the publication of primarily (though not exclusively) nonconformist works reflects a solidly dissenting upbringing. His father, a businessman, probably a chandler, was arrested and tried by the court of high commission in 1634 for holding conventicles and denouncing the practices of the Church of England; in 1656, he became a founder and first elder of the Rothwell Independent Church. His son Nathaniel's religious affiliation remained broadly Independent throughout his life.<br>
<br>On 2 June 1656 Nathaniel Ponder was apprenticed by the Stationers' Company to Robert Gibbs, a bookseller specializing in political tracts, at the sign of the Golden Ball in Chancery Lane, London; Ponder was made free of the Stationers' Company on 4 July 1663. His precise occupation over the next five years is not fully documented, although he does appear to have been working as a stationer. On 15 October 1666 he married Mary Guy (<i>b</i>. 1645), daughter of a Kettering gentleman, in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, where Ponder was still living in 1675. They had at least four children, including one son, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1671), who was to join his father briefly as a bookseller in the early 1690s.<br>
<br>By 1668 Ponder was established as a bookseller at the sign of the Peacock in Chancery Lane: his first publication, <span class="italic">Exercitations on the Epistle to the Hebrews &hellip; with an Exposition on the Two First Chapters</span>, by the congregationalist divine John Owen, was entered in the <span class="italic">Register</span> of the Stationers' Company on 22 April of that year. For the next three decades Ponder oversaw the publication of the nonconformist works of divinity and political pamphlets on which his reputation rests&#151;and against which his 1680 edition of the <span class="italic">Biblia sacra</span>, a Latin <span class="roman">Bible</span>, stands out as an anomaly. He also, however, published a number of mathematical, grammatical, and catechetical textbooks, as well as medical treatises. In view of the Restoration government's stringent censorship laws, a large proportion of Ponder's work was necessarily published without licence; until the fall of James II in 1688 he thus worked under the constant threat of investigation and prosecution. From 1668 Ponder became John Owen's principal publisher and continued as such until 1684, the year after Owen's death. However, it is through his association with two other writers&#151;the MP, poet, and satirist, Andrew Marvell, and the Baptist preacher and writer John Bunyan&#151;that Ponder achieved, respectively, notoriety and fame.<br>
<br>In 1672 Ponder was in a sufficiently respectable position to negotiate the licensing of certain nonconformist ministers to preach at private houses in Northamptonshire. In the same year, however, he organized the publication, anonymously and without licence, of Andrew Marvell's <span class="italic">The Rehearsal Transpros'd</span>, a satirical animadversion on the reactionary Anglicanism of Samuel Parker, future bishop of Oxford. Attempts by the Stationers' Company and Sir Roger L'Estrange, surveyor of the presses, to proceed against Ponder were thwarted by intervention of the earl of Anglesey, who insisted that the king approved of the libel. L'Estrange agreed to license the work subject to excisions, though the clerk of the Stationers' Company refused to register it. Nevertheless, despite a modified title-page, the second issue was published unexpurgated. At L'Estrange's insistence, the second edition incorporated the modifications previously stipulated. In this censored edition, moreover, Ponder positively identified himself as the pamphlet's bookseller and warned its readers against a pirated edition in circulation; the problem of print piracy was to trouble him for the remainder of his career.<br>
<br>No further action appears to have been taken against Ponder over <span class="italic">The Rehearsal Transpros'd</span>. Nevertheless, the bookseller was imprisoned for a fortnight in May 1676 for organizing the printing of a certain unlicensed and seditious pamphlet long believed to be <span class="italic">The Rehearsal Transpros'd</span>  (Harrison, 262). It is now clear, however, that the anonymous pamphlet in question was another work by Marvell, <span class="italic">Mr Smirke, or, The Divine in Mode &hellip; together with a Short Historical Essay</span>, printed in 1676. This pamphlet was a particularly dangerous work to publish: counterattacking another Anglican animadverter and future bishop, Francis Turner, it is furthermore a savage expos&eacute; of intolerance within church and state, and appears to have struck a particularly raw nerve within the establishment.<br>
<br>About 1676 Ponder opened a second shop (also styled at the sign of the Peacock) in The Poultry and for some time ran it concurrently with that in Chancery Lane. In 1678, following an apparent introduction by John Owen, he published <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> for John Bunyan. This licensed and hugely influential best-seller, which ran to at least nine editions within five years, sealed the reputation not only of its author but also of its publisher, who, according to his fellow bookseller John Dunton, consequently became known as Bunyan Ponder  (Dunton, 437). The success of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>, however, soon raised copyright problems: in 1679, Ponder filed a common lawsuit against a printer, Thomas Braddyll, for printing a pirated edition of this text. While the case did not proceed, Ponder reiterated his grievance, and his copyright, in an &#145;advertisement&#146; to the fourth edition (1680).<br>
<br>Ponder proceeded to publish many other of Bunyan's works, including <span class="italic">The Life and Death of Mr Badman</span> (1680), the second part of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> (1684), and a small number of sermon treatises; he also undertook later editions of Bunyan's spiritual autobiography, <span class="italic">Grace Abounding</span>, and his major narrative, <span class="italic">The Holy War</span>. In the 1680s, however, Ponder's life became dominated increasingly by lawsuits in which he was generally the plaintiff&#151;with the exception of an undocumented action for assault which Bartholomew Sprint, a London bookseller, brought in 1681 against Ponder and a number of other booksellers and printers. In 1688 Ponder was imprisoned for debt in the king's bench prison. Between 1691 and 1696 he filed a series of actions seeking redress from debtors, creditors, and indeed defrauders. In 1697 he again initiated proceedings against Braddyll, who, commissioned by Ponder to print a number of Bunyan's works, allegedly produced&#151;and profited from&#151;unauthorized surplus copies.<br>
<br>While Ponder's later years were dominated by almost continual litigation, the outcome of individual cases is uncertain. It is clear, however, that despite the phenomenal success of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> Ponder was frequently in debt, and that the cases which he initiated&#151;a costly business in itself&#151;invariably concerned allegations of financial wrongdoing. The removal of his business to premises in London-Yard, St Paul's, about 1695, coincides with this apparent decline into hardship. By the time of his death in June 1699 Ponder appears to have had few means, apparently dying intestate. He was buried at the church of St Gregory by Paul in London on 22 June of that year. Despite his responsibility for some of the most salient and controversial publications of his time, Bunyan Ponder remains an enigmatic figure. In the absence of personal information there is only the noncommittal testimony by his fellow bookseller John Dunton that &#145;He has sweetness and enterprize in his air, which plead and anticipate in his favour&#146;  (Dunton, 437).<br>
