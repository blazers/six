</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Southwell, Sir  Richard</span>  (1502/3&#150;1564), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, came of a family which originated in Suffolk and had recently prospered in government service. He was the eldest son of Francis Southwell (<i>d</i>. 1512), an auditor of the exchequer, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of William Tendring of Little Birch, Essex. The lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26063/', "Sir Robert Southwell")</script> was one of his younger brothers. Richard became heir not only to his father, but also to his uncle Sir Robert Southwell, chief butler to Henry VII, who died in 1514 leaving an estate based on the manor of Woodrising, Norfolk. In 1515 Richard became the ward of Sir Robert's widow and William Wootton. Four years later the wardship was acquired by Sir Thomas Wyndham, who married Richard to his stepdaughter Thomasin, the sister of Sir Thomas Darcy.<br>
<br>The Southwells and the Wyndhams were both clients of the Howards, in whose household Richard may have been brought up, perhaps latterly alongside Henry Howard, from 1524 styled earl of Surrey. There is no record that Southwell attended university, but in 1526 he entered Lincoln's Inn, and he must have been well educated since he became tutor to Thomas Cromwell's son Gregory, who for a time lived with him in Norfolk. Southwell is said to have instructed him in pronunciation and etymology. In 1525, presumably now of age, he had livery of his lands. In 1531 he became a JP for Norfolk and Suffolk, a position he retained until 1554.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1532, with accomplices who included his brothers Robert and Anthony, Richard killed Sir William Pennington in sanctuary at Westminster. Pennington had married a cousin of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, and was the latter's tenant of the manor of Costessey, and the crime may have arisen from a competition for pre-eminence in East Anglia between Brandon and the Howards. The Howards and Cromwell were able to obtain a pardon for Southwell and his followers on 15 June 1532, though his crime cost Richard a fine of &pound;1000, subsequently confirmed by act of parliament. Instead of money he gave the king his Essex manors of Coggeshall and Filolls Hall. The affair did not prevent Southwell from being made sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1534, while in 1536, thanks to Cromwell's patronage, he and his brother Robert were named receivers in the court of augmentations. In this office Southwell dealt with the lands of dissolved monasteries in East Anglia. He himself obtained lands formerly held by several religious houses in Norfolk, but nevertheless displayed his conservative religious sympathies by writing an appeal on behalf of Pentney Priory. He also acquired lands which had belonged to the priory of St John of Jerusalem. During the Pilgrimage of Grace he assisted the duke of Norfolk in raising forces from that county. Knighted in 1540, from 1542 until the death of Henry VIII he was one of the three general surveyors of the king's lands.<br>
<br>Southwell's parliamentary career may have begun in 1536: the returns for this election are lost, but it is possible that he succeeded Sir James Boleyn as one of the knights of the shire for Norfolk following Anne Boleyn's fall. He was certainly elected in 1539, but only after a fracas with Sir Edmund Knyvet, who also coveted the seat and chose to disregard the king's nomination of Southwell and Edmund Wyndham. He probably sat again in 1542.<br>
<br>Southwell played a part in the fall of both Sir Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell. Roper's life of More records that Southwell was sent to More's room in the Tower to take away his books. While there he heard the famous exchange between More and Sir Richard Rich in which the former chancellor denied that parliament could make the king head of the church. When asked to give evidence against More, however, he said that he was appointed only to deal with the books and &#145;gave no ear&#146; to the conversation  (Roper, 244&#150;8). In March 1540 Southwell (who was presumably still loyal to Cromwell) was one of six men who took a deposition from one Thomas Molton, who was charged with having said that the world would never be quiet so long as one so base in birth as Cromwell served on the king's council.<br>
<br>Southwell was several times sent on administrative and diplomatic missions. In 1542 Henry VIII dispatched him, together with Lord Lisle, the deputy of Calais, to view the fortifications at Berwick; they reported that the new works did not conform to the designs approved by the king although 20,000 marks had been spent and much more would be required to complete the project. In January 1543 he was again involved in Scottish affairs, being sent with Bothwell to Darlington, for discussions with Scottish nobles who had recently pledged loyalty to Henry VIII. In the king's war with France he was treasurer of the &#145;battle&#146; ward and in 1544 received more than &pound;65,000 for wages and other expenses. Shortly before Henry VIII's death Southwell was granted an annuity of &pound;100, and the king's will included a bequest of &pound;200 in token of his &#145;special love and favour&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 20, pt 2, no. 634).<br>
<br>Named one of the assistant executors of Henry's will, Southwell was probably hoping to ingratiate himself with the Seymours when he helped bring about the fall of the earl of Surrey, notwithstanding his own previously close relationship with the Howards. It was Southwell who on 2 December 1546 notified the privy council &#145;that he knew certain things of the Earl that touched his fidelity to the King&#146;  (Starkey, 157), leading to Surrey's arrest for treason, and he later gave evidence against the earl. But perhaps because of his religious conservatism he was not made a member of the privy council (as has been claimed) following the king's death, being only one of &#145;certen of the counsell at large&#146;  (Hoak, 49). In October 1549 he was among the conservatives who supported John Dudley, earl of Warwick, and his allies against the protector, and he now briefly became a privy councillor, but once Warwick had gained firm control of government Southwell lost his place on the council and in January 1550 he was sent to the Tower, charged with writing seditious bills. Bishop John Ponet claimed that Southwell had done enough to be hanged for, a charge possibly arising from allegations that in the previous summer he had given royal money to the Norfolk rebels, but he was soon released. He did not, however, sit in either of Edward VI's parliaments.<br>
<br>In 1553 Southwell at first accepted Lady Jane Grey as Edward VI's heir, but he soon resolved to stand by Princess Mary, and by 12 July brought her &#145;reinforcements of men, a store of provisions and moreover money &hellip; not to mention his own skill in counsel and long experience&#146;; in acting thus he claimed to be mindful of &#145;the many favours heaped on him by Henry VIII&#146;  (MacCulloch, 254). For his services he was rewarded on 4 December with an annuity of &pound;100. He remained loyal to Mary at the time of Wyatt's rising early in 1554, guarding the rear of Whitehall with 500 men. The new queen restored him to the privy council and made him master of the ordnance. Within her administration Southwell served on a number of commissions. A follower of the chancellor, Bishop Stephen Gardiner, he supported the latter in favouring her marriage to Edward Courtenay rather than to Philip of Spain. But though returned to parliament as a knight of the shire for Norfolk in the first three parliaments of Mary's reign (he is said to have announced the queen's supposed pregnancy to the Lords in 1554), he became less active in public affairs after Gardiner's death at the end of 1555. His religious position remained staunchly conservative: according to John Foxe he exclaimed against protestants &#145;to the rack with them, one of these knaves is able to undo a whole city&#146;  (Loach, 177).<br>
<br>Southwell was not reappointed to the privy council following Elizabeth's accession and in 1559 surrendered his offices in exchange for an annuity of &pound;165. He was too weak to sign his long will, dated 24 July 1561 (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/47, fols. 144<i>r</i>&#150;152<i>r</i>), but did not die until 11 January 1564, probably at Woodrising. His landholdings were substantial and included more than thirty manors in Norfolk alone, together with over 10,000 sheep. Succession to his estates was complicated by the fact that his two sons were illegitimate. He and his first wife, Thomasin Darcy of Danbury, Essex, had a daughter, Elizabeth, who married George Heneage. His second wife was Mary, the daughter of Thomas Darcy of Danbury and a relative of Thomasin. They had two sons, Richard and Thomas, who were born of their adulterous relationship while Mary was still married to the Norwich alderman Robert Leeche, and a daughter, Katherine, born following her marriage to Southwell. Sir Richard had settled land on his elder son (who was the father of Robert Southwell the Jesuit) before his death, and in his will he made no distinction between his legitimate and illegitimate offspring. Should Elizabeth attempt to break the will she was to be disinherited. Southwell left his personal armour to his cousin and friend Sir Henry Bedingfield and other armour to the young fourth duke of Norfolk, whom he named as an executor, together with Sir Thomas Cornwallis and Francis Gawdy. The will records a well-furnished household, containing such items as &#145;hangings of imagry worke&#146; bought for Woodrising, where they were &#145;accustomed to hange my hawle at highe and solempe feastes&#146;, and &#145;a tester of cloth of silver tynsell and crimsen vellet enbrodered wheruppon myne armes ar sett&#146;. Sir Richard also disposed of large quantities of plate, including &#145;one rounde balle wherwith to warme colde handes&#146;. A lengthy codicil provided for payments to a number of servants and friends. Southwell asked to be buried in the chancel of Woodrising church, where the Easter sepulchre once stood, but that was the limit of his religious traditionalism. Though he left &pound;100 to be distributed to the poor and indigent of the village and of 10 miles around, he did not request the beneficiaries of this gift to pray for his soul, and in the preamble to his will he referred to Queen Elizabeth as defender of the faith and entrusted his soul to the Trinity alone.<br>
<br>A loyal councillor and efficient administrator under Henry VIII, Southwell was never in the top echelon of advisers who made or directed policy. The reasons for his failure to achieve true eminence may be implicit in his portrait by Holbein, which suggests a man both haughty and indecisive. Painted in 1536 when Southwell was thirty-three, the picture formerly belonged to the fourteenth earl of Arundel, who gave it to Cosimo (II) de' Medici, grand duke of Tuscany. It is now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Holbein's drawing of Southwell remains in the Royal Collection at Windsor.<br>
