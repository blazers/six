<span class="headword">Ashwardby,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1380&#150;<em>c.</em>1400), <span class="occ">theological controversialist</span>, was admitted vicar of St Mary's, Oxford, on 26 November 1384, and had left it by July 1395; he was chancellor's commissary by 27 November 1391, by when he was doctor of theology; since the living of St Mary's was appropriated to Oriel, he may have been associated with that college, though there is no surviving evidence that he was a fellow. Details of his views, which were hostile to the mendicant friars, emerge from two surviving texts (a determination and a sermon) by his opponent, the Carmelite <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17803/', "Richard Maidstone")</script>; although John Bale gives the incipit to one of Ashwardby's works, <span class="italic">Contra fraterculum mendicitatem</span>, neither this, nor any of the other eight works Bale attributes to Ashwardby, is known to survive. From Maidstone's evidence it would seem that the argument between them continued over some time, and through various exchanges both in the university in Latin and, on Ashwardby's side, also in English sermons at St Mary's. Though a chronology of some of the contributions emerges, the year of the debate cannot be precisely fixed: from the chronology of Maidstone's life a date after 1390 seems most likely. Ashwardby's views on the friars, in so far as they can be reconstructed from his opponent's statements, had declaredly echoed those of Richard Fitzralph (<i>d</i>. 1360), but to an Oxford congregation at this date would inevitably have recalled John Wyclif's (whom Maidstone does not mention); his methods, in taking the argument to those outside the university world of Latin, recall those of Wyclif's academic followers in 1381&#150;2. Nothing is known of Ashwardby's later life. Bale's list of works could have been derived (with the exception of the single incipit) from the two works of Maidstone that Bale owned.<br>
