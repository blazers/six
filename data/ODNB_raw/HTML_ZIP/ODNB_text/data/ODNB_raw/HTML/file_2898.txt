<span class="headword">Boothby, Sir  Brooke</span>, seventh baronet  (1744&#150;1824), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 3 June 1744 at Ashbourne Hall, Derbyshire, the eldest son of Sir Brooke Boothby, sixth baronet (1710&#150;1789), of Ashbourne Hall and Phoeby Hollins (1716&#150;1788). In 1752 the family moved to Stafford, where Boothby attended the free school. They returned to Ashbourne Hall in 1761 and on 19 June that year Boothby was admitted as a pensioner to St John's College, Cambridge, but left without taking a degree. Boothby's father had wanted his son to follow a career in the law. Brooke, however, had set his heart on joining the army and was therefore sent to a military academy at Caen, Normandy. After completing his studies he was bought a commission in the Irish regiment of 18th light dragoons. Boothby accompanied Lord Hertford to Dublin and France and in 1767 joined the regiment at Irish county quarters. He retired from the army on half pay in 1772 and settled in his house in Lichfield. He joined the literary circle at Lichfield to which Anna Seward, Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Day, and the Edgeworths belonged, and was a member of a botanical society which Erasmus Darwin started there. One of Seward's odes and several of her printed letters are addressed to him.<br>
<br>Boothby wrote that:<blockquote>From the age of thirty to that of forty my life was dedicated to the <i>beau monde</i> at home &amp; abroad. A member of the ladies club, of Brookes, the summers at Brighton, Cheltenham &amp;c. &amp; the opera and fine assembl[i]es &#150; ten years of vanity and folly! (Mosley, 6)</blockquote>In 1775 he travelled in Italy, visiting Turin, Florence, Rome, and Naples, and returning via Venice, the Tyrol, Strasbourg, and Paris. During his stay in Paris, Boothby called on Jean-Jacques Rousseau to renew a friendship that had begun when the latter had stayed at Wootton Hall, near Ashbourne, between 1766 and 1767. Boothby expressed his admiration for Rousseau in a letter to Lord Harcourt: &#145;During the six weeks that I was in Paris I passed much of my time with this <i>divine man</i>, &amp; my love &amp; respect are grown into absolute adoration&#146;  (ibid., 1). The well-known portrait of Boothby by Joseph Wright of Derby shows him holding a volume of Rousseau. In 1780, two years after Rousseau's death, Boothby published <span class="italic">Rousseau juge de Jean Jacques: dialogue</span>.<br>
<br>Boothby's period of vanity and folly ended with his marriage at St George's, Hanover, London, on 15 July 1784 to Susanna (1755&#150;1822), daughter of Robert Bristow or Bristoe of Micheldever, Hampshire. The only child of this marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55391/', "Penelope Boothby")</script>, died on 13 March 1791 at the age of six years, and was interred in Ashbourne church, where a monument by Thomas Banks RA was erected to her memory. It is said that Penelope's death caused Boothby and his wife to separate, never to be reconciled. In his daughter's honour Boothby published <span class="italic">Sorrows Sacred to the Memory of Penelope</span> (1796).<br>
<br>Boothby had succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father on 9 April 1789. In the next year he published <span class="italic">A Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke</span>, a reply to Burke's <span class="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</span>. Boothby followed this with his <span class="italic">Observations on the Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs</span> (1792), in which he makes an earnest defence of Rousseau. Some time about 1794 he left England after suffering, as he put it in a letter to Lord Wellesley in 1806, &#145;pecuniary indiscretions which I have more cause to lament than be ashamed of&#146;, indiscretions which had caused him to be &#145;a solitary wanderer on the continent ever since&#146;  (Mosley, 2). Boothby's wanderings took him to Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Weimar, where, in 1804, he met Goethe, who recalled that &#145;His health was not good: he complained of our cold winters, disliked silk stockings, and could ride better than he danced&#146;  (ibid., 5). The winter of 1803&#150;4 Boothby passed alone in a ch&acirc;teau on the banks of the Mein. His translation of Racine's <span class="italic">Britannicus</span> appeared in 1803. Boothby was in Dresden in 1806 and in Edinburgh two years later. Another translation, <span class="italic">Fables and Satires, with a Preface on the Esopean Fable</span>, was published in 1809. According to Robert Pearse Gillies &#145;Sir Brooke's habits were insulated and secluded&#151;in his own phrase, he had done with the world, and his best philosophy seemed to consist in forgetting it altogether&#146;  (ibid., 5). He lived according to a routine he had adopted in Weimar: rising between four and five, dining at two, then, after finishing his writing, spending time on his watercolour drawings. At the end of the Napoleonic wars Boothby left Edinburgh for Brussels where he began to work on his memoirs. His wife died in Dover in 1822. Boothby lived on for another two years, dying on 23 January 1824, at Boulogne according to some sources, at Brussels according to others  (ibid., 3). His corpse was returned to Ashbourne where it was buried in the church on Friday 13 February. He was briefly succeeded as baronet by his only brother, William, who died on 17 March 1824.<br>
