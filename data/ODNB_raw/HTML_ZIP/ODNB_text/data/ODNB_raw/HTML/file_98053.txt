<span class="headword">Russell,  George Neville <span class="st"> [Charles]</span></span>  (1899&#150;1971), <span class="occ">army officer and director of nationalized road transport</span>, was born at 57 Tufnell Park Road, Islington, London, on 19 October 1899, the eldest of the three illegitimate sons of Emily Mary Russell (1870&#150;1959) and Sir Edward George Jenkinson (1835&#150;1919), civil servant and businessman. His father had served in the Indian Civil Service before, in 1882, being posted to Dublin Castle where he organized the police operations against secret societies in Ireland. He continued his anti-Fenian work in London, after which he engaged in mining speculations in Mexico, and then became chairman of Daimler and a prime mover in both the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. By 1911 Sir Edward, though still married to Annabella Jenkinson (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Monck-Mason), was styling himself George Russell, living with Emily, and purporting to be her husband. George Neville Russell had several half siblings, the children of Sir Edward and Annabella.<br>
<br>Russell spent his first years in Islington, Luton, and Linslade, Buckinghamshire. He was educated in Linslade and at Arnold House preparatory school, Llanddulas, North Wales before entering Rugby School, Warwickshire, where he was a pupil between 1913 and 1917. After attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 20 September 1918, and had his first experience of a war zone during the Arab uprising of 1919&#150;20, gaining the Iraq medal with two clasps. Other medals and honours followed during and after the Second World War; most notably he became CBE in 1943 and CB in 1946.<br>
<br>Promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1920, Russell served as an adjutant in 1921. In 1925&#150;6 the army sent him to Cambridge University, though he never took a degree. On 18 June 1927 he married Iris Margaret, daughter of Charles Mills, wine shipper, of Wimbledon. They had two daughters. Between 1934 and 1936 he was seconded to the Institute of Engineering at the Royal Military College, Canada, in Kingston, Ontario. For much of his military career Russell's rate of promotion was unexceptional: he became a captain in 1929 and major in 1938. Thereafter his progression was rapid; when his military career ended in 1947 he held the rank of major-general.<br>
<br>During the Second World War and afterwards Russell occupied a variety of roles in the army's transport sector. In France, serving with the British expeditionary force, he was responsible for all road and rail movements. Subsequently he was, successively, director of movements, GHQ, Middle East, 1942&#150;3; deputy quartermaster-general (movements and transportation), GHQ, New Delhi, 1944&#150;5; and transportation adviser to the special commissioner in south-east Asia, 1946&#150;7. He was director of movements during the battle of El Alamein and the invasion of Sicily. Early in his military career Russell was nicknamed Charles. Thereafter, he was universally known by this sobriquet. Divorced from his first wife in 1946, he married, second, in Singapore on 28 August 1946, Jocelyn Delia Harvey (<i>b</i>. 1914), only daughter of Frank Bennett, a general practitioner. They first met in Cairo in 1941 and their marriage produced two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>In 1948, after leaving the army, Russell was appointed chairman of the Road Transport Executive (RTE, later the Road Haulage Executive or RHE), one of five bodies responsible for running Britain's newly nationalized transport systems under the terms of the <span class="roman">Transport Act</span>, 1947. His salary was &pound;5000 per annum and his management style bore the stamp of his military background (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 June 1949; Bonavia, 74). At first the industry journal was &#145;slightly dubious&#146; about having a former soldier in charge of road haulage, even one as experienced and successful in the field of military transport as Russell  (<span class="italic">Commercial Motor</span>, 19 March 1948, 21). It feared that he would falter in the face of opposition from those within the haulage industry who abhorred nationalization. However, his genial manner and measured, business-like approach to his duties quickly won over doubters, and he was soon referred to in favourable terms, as &#145;the man at the wheel of Britain's nationalised road transport&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commercial Motor</span>, 8 April 1949, 4).<br>
<br>At the RTE Russell had the &#145;mammoth&#146; task of creating British Road Services (BRS), which he chaired and managed between 1948 and 1959, out of the thousands of long-distance haulage businesses taken into public ownership in 1949. At its peak in 1951 BRS had around 80,000 staff and 40,000 vehicles. Following the election of a Conservative government in 1951, enactment of the <span class="roman">Transport Act</span>, 1953, and abolition of the RHE, Russell was effectively required to denationalize road haulage and transfer the BRS fleet back to private ownership.<br>
<br>Three years later, following another reversal of government policy, Russell was called upon to reorganize the remaining, still substantial, BRS business. Some 16,000 vehicles and 40,000 employees were divided between five limited liability companies that all traded under the BRS &#145;umbrella&#146; with Russell in overall control. During Russell's time at the helm BRS was in an almost constant state of upheaval and its return on capital was not always impressive. But drivers enjoyed working for it because, unlike many private operators, it maintained its vehicles to the highest standards. Furthermore, because its credit was good, fuel retailers never refused service.<br>
<br>Russell was elected to the council of the Institute of Transport in 1953 and was its president in 1958&#150;9. Over the years he delivered many papers to the institute. Among these were his 1957 Henry Spurrier lecture, &#145;Transport and the Commonweal&#146;, and a much praised presidential address (October 1958), &#145;Management in Transport&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1959 Russell relinquished his post at BRS when appointed a full-time member of the British transport commission, having previously served successively on its London midland and eastern area boards. He chaired it in 1961&#150;2, immediately before its break up. At the commission, where Russell faced the &#145;baffling problems of transport as a whole&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Aug 1971), he was disinclined to view road haulage as an inferior adjunct to railways. Between 1962 and 1964 he served on the newly established British Railway board during preparation and publication of the highly controversial Beeching report which recommended extensive cuts to the rail network. As chairman of Railway Sites Ltd Russell's main responsibility on the board was British Railways' property portfolio but he believed that the railways had to &#145;pay their way&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Nov 1962).<br>
<br>On reaching pensionable age in 1964, Russell retired from the British Railways board. However, he maintained a long standing interest in subsidized or social housing; until 1970 he was chairman of the Sutton Dwelling Trust, a post he assumed in 1962. He was also, for two years, chairman of the publicly owned manufacturers Bristol Commercial Vehicles Ltd and Eastern Coach Works Ltd.<br>
<br>Throughout his military and civilian transport career Russell loved nothing more than to escape his desk by undertaking personal tours of inspection to gain hands-on experience and see conditions for himself. Until dissuaded by colleagues at BRS concerned that he was &#145;telegraphing&#146; his impending arrival, he was in the habit of travelling to inspections in a chauffeur-driven Humber bearing the registration number BRS 1. Typically, when booked to give a speech at a Road Hauliers' Association dinner in Birmingham in 1948, he travelled to the venue in a 14 ton 8 wheeler in order to &#145;find out for himself what conditions were like on the road&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commercial Motor</span>, 23 April 1948, 49). In the company of his driver he ate a 1<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. meal at a roadhouse on the way.<br>
<br>Russell was tall and rangy with sandy hair and a small military moustache. He possessed great energy and enthusiasm, to the extent that he was sometimes dubbed Cyclone Charlie. His many leisure pursuits included walking, gardening, the theatre, music, cards, sailing and other sports, and mess dinners with soldier friends. In character he was extrovert, sociable, humorous, determined and outspoken, sometimes irascible. Having been resident for some months at Stourpaine, Blandford Forum, Dorset, he died on 24 August 1971 at the General Infirmary, Salisbury, of uraemia melaena and a gastric ulcer. After a funeral service at Stourpaine on 27 August 1971, he was cremated in Salisbury. A memorial service took place in London two months later.<br>
