<span class="headword">Gospatric</span>, first earl of Lothian  (<em>d.</em> 1138), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was apparently the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11110/', "Gospatric, earl of Northumbria")</script>, who fled to Scotland <i>c</i>.1072 and was given lands in Lothian by Malcolm III (<i>r</i>. 1058&#150;93). Of the events of his life there is little record. His earliest mention in a Scottish writ comes <i>c</i>.1120, and while he attested a number of Scottish charters between <i>c</i>.1120 and 1134, he is very seldom styled earl. Rather, he is consistently referred to as &#145;Gospatric the brother of Dolfin&#146;, and his seal even bore this inscription. In one of his own charters, dated between 1124 and 1138, Gospatric did style himself &#145;Earl Gospatric, brother of Dolfin&#146;, while in a charter of David I, dated about June 1138, he appeared as &#145;Earl Gospatric&#146;. The absence of the title of earl in most of these documents is puzzling. Indeed, it has sometimes led to the supposition that he could not have been earl of Lothian, this position being held instead by his brother Dolfin. Such a conclusion is not, however, generally accepted, and it may be that Gospatric received Lothian <i>c</i>.1134, which would help to explain why he is referred to as earl only in charters dated between about 1134 and 1138.<br>
<br>Gospatric's status in Northumbria is somewhat better attested. In early 1136, immediately after Henry I's death, Stephen confirmed his predecessor's grant to Gospatric of Beanley and other lands in Northumbria, amounting to at least fourteen manors. The service was not specified, but a document of 1212 stated that the barony had been held from the time of King Henry for &#145;inborh and utborh&#146;, suggesting that the earls of Lothian (later Dunbar) were required to regulate border disputes, and that his grants represented an attempt by Henry to bring the border region under better control. There can be no doubt that his status as lord of Beanley and earl of Lothian placed Gospatric in the topmost ranks of cross-border landholders. He clearly enjoyed prominence at the Scottish court, as evidenced by his appearances in the witness lists to royal acts, and also found favour with Henry I. His status in the north is significant in two further contexts. The first is the re-emergence of native Englishmen in positions of authority in the north in the period between 1100 and 1135, a notable feature of the reign of Henry I; the second is the fact that, from the perspective of the southern side of the border, at least, Gospatric should be regarded as one of Henry's &#145;new men&#146; in the north.<br>
<br>Gospatric's benefactions to the church suggest a conventional piety, although perhaps somewhat less than commensurate with his position as a great landholder in two realms. His only benefaction to an English monastery was a grant of the church of Edlingham to St Albans, although he did grant Edrom and Nesbit to Coldingham Priory, a dependency of Durham. In Scotland, Gospatric was a benefactor of the church of St Nicholas of Home in Berwickshire. With an unknown wife Gospatric had four sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50324/', "Gospatric")</script>, who succeeded his father as earl of Lothian, and Adam, Edward, and Edgar, who were generously supported with English lands&#151;and one daughter, Juliana. Prominent local families descended from two of his sons, while his daughter married Ranulf de Merlay, lord of Morpeth, and the couple later, in 1138 or 1139, founded the Cistercian monastery of Newminster.<br>
<br>Gospatric is believed to have died at the battle of the Standard, fought at Cowton Moor, north of Northallerton, on 22 August 1138, Henry of Huntingdon recording in his chronicle that the &#145;chief leader of the men of Lothian&#146; was struck by an arrow and fell in battle at the head of a contingent of troops  (Anderson, 203). He was certainly dead by 16 August 1139, when King David confirmed one of his grants to Coldingham, giving the monks the lands as Gospatric had held them from &#145;the day he was living and dead&#146;  (Lawrie, no. 121). The place of his burial is not known.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_50323"></a><span class="headword">Dolfin</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1092), the brother of Gospatric, is also a significant figure in northern history. Since the order of the three sons of Gospatric, earl of Northumbria, is usually given by medieval authors as Dolfin, Waldeve, and Gospatric, it is generally assumed that Dolfin was the eldest of the brothers. He has been identified with Dolfin of Carlisle, who was driven out by William Rufus in 1092. Some historians have proposed a different identification for Dolfin of Carlisle, however, suggesting that he was a descendant of that Dolfin, a Cumbrian noble, who was killed during Siward's invasion of Scotland in 1054. There is little evidence to sustain such an interpretation. It seems more likely that Dolfin was indeed the son of Gospatric, and was given governorship of Cumberland at the same time as extensive lands in Lothian were bestowed upon his father. His status as ruler of Cumbria may be reflected in the fact that his two younger brothers, Waldeve and Gospatric, styled themselves &#145;brother of Dolfin&#146;.<br>
