<span class="headword">Read,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1733&#150;1787), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was a pupil at the St Martin's Lane Academy, London. He was then apprenticed to Fran&ccedil;ois Roubiliac, who is said to have accepted him following entreaties from Read's father, despite his declared wish not to take apprentices. According to his obituary, Read finished one of Roubiliac's busts in his master's absence and on his return the sculptor was so delighted that &#145;they continued inseparable friends ever after and all distinction was lost in the affection he bore him&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 57, 1787, 644). While this anecdote may be a variant of a familiar type, it seems to indicate rightly the important place that Read had within Roubiliac's small studio. In 1750 George Vertue mentioned a &#145;young man, an apprentice of Mr. Rubbilac&#146; (with the name Nicholas added in the margin), and noted with approval a drawing of an academy figure which &#145;shows great skill &amp; fire &amp; spirit extraordinary&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.152). Read's abilities as a carver were evidently valued by Roubiliac, and he was reported to have carved the skeletal Death on the monument to Joseph and Elizabeth Nightingale (commissioned 1758; erected 1761; Westminster Abbey), the most dramatic figure in one of Roubiliac's most celebrated works. After Roubiliac's death Read announced in January 1762 that, as &#145;a Person who for sixteen years past has studied under him, and executed a great Part of his most capital Works&#146; he &#145;means to succeed him&#146;  (H. Walpole, &#145;Book of materials&#146;, I, 154, MS Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University, Farmington, Connecticut). This bid to continue the workshop did not succeed, for in March he was advertising casts from Roubiliac's &#145;Moulds for Busts&#146;, stating that &#145;these Moulds will shortly be disposed of by publick Auction&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Read executed (and signed) the monument to Francis Hooper in Trinity College, Cambridge, with its bust by Roubiliac, and is likely to have played a major role in the completion of some of the sculptor's later small monuments, such as those to Lucretia Betenson (<i>d</i>. 1758; Wrotham, Kent) and John Wale (<i>d</i>. 1761; Earl's Colne, Essex). But Read's activity as an independent sculptor following Roubiliac's death failed to live up to his early promise, though he was certainly not lacking in ambition. In the early 1760s his talent was recognized by the Society of Arts, which awarded him two of the largest premiums given for sculpture, the first of 100 guineas for a &#145;life-sized figure in marble of Actaeon and his dog&#146; in 1762 and the second for &pound;147 for a &#145;Diana by a Rock&#146; two years later  (Dossie, 440). From about this date until 1780 Read was a frequent exhibitor at both the Society of Artists and the Free Society. During the 1760s he received commissions for a number of small monuments, such as those to James Kendal (West Horsely, Sussex), incorporating motifs used earlier in Roubiliac's workshop. He also enjoyed some success in attracting those patrons who admired the dramatic narrative qualities of his master's later work. The monument to the merchant Nicholas Magens (<i>d</i>. 1764) at Brightlingsea, Essex (described in the <span class="italic">Ipswich Journal</span> for 8 November 1766), combines elements from Roubiliac's Warren, Hargrave, and Argyll monuments, albeit in an undisciplined way. A rather less elaborate but still dramatic monument at Probus, Cornwall, to Thomas Hawkins (<i>d</i>. 1766), with mourning widow and descending angel, may also be attributed to him. His best-known work, however, is the vast machine high on the south aisle in Westminster Abbey commemorating Admiral Tyrell (<i>d</i>. 1766). This represents the almost naked figure of the admiral being summoned from the deep at the last trump in an illusionistic scene involving billowing waves, the admiral's ship, allegorical figures, and much else. Described in the 1783 guide to the abbey as a &#145;magnificent monument&#146;, it was already being ridiculed in the same year not only for its &#145;pancake&#146; clouds but also for the way it combined so many disparate elements &#145;that we are no more tempted to dream of symmetry and arrangement at the view, than we should be at the sight of a broker's-shop in Moorside&#146;  (Ralph, 11&#150;12). It was partially demolished in the later nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1779 Read unsuccessfully submitted a design for the monument to Lord Chatham, a commission given to John Bacon. He died on 11 July 1787, having been &#145;totally deprived of reason a short time before his death&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 57, 1787, 644). A posthumous sale included plaster casts of busts, reliefs, and &#145;a small monument complete&#146;  (Gunnis, 318). Read was described by J. T. Smith as &#145;a conceited spark who used to annoy the great sculptor&#146;. His larger monuments strive for the drama of his master's work but lack their intelligence; they are distinguished by their fine passages of carving, even if they are uncontrolled in their design. Rather than adapting Roubiliac's handling of the surfaces of marble sculpture to a new neo-classical aesthetic, as did Wilton and Bacon, Read continued to rework in an exaggerated way the scenic effects of his teacher, to the detriment of his own reputation.<br>
