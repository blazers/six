<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitworth,  Charles</span>, Earl Whitworth  (1752&#150;1825), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was born at Leybourne Grange, Kent, on 19 May 1752, and baptized there on 29 May, the eldest of the three sons (there were also four daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29337/', "Sir Charles Whitworth (c.1721&#150;1778)")</script>, MP, and his wife, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1786), the daughter of Richard Shelley of Conduit Street, London, latterly commissioner of the stamp office, and the niece of Sir John Shelley, fourth baronet. After education at Tonbridge School from 1761 to 1765, Whitworth, like his father, initially chose an army career, and on 30 March 1772 he became an ensign in the 1st foot guards. He served in North America in 1776&#150;7. On 22 May 1781 he became a captain, and on 8 April 1783, by exchange, was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 104th regiment. Later in that year the duke of Dorset was appointed ambassador at Paris and Whitworth, who ventured there, impressed Queen Marie-Antoinette by his handsome figure and insinuating manners. She and Dorset are credited by the memoirist Sir Nathaniel Wraxall with obtaining for him his first diplomatic posting.<h2>
<a name="DiplomaticcareerPolandRussiaandDenmark"></a>Diplomatic career: Poland, Russia, and Denmark</h2>Whitworth left England as envoy-extraordinary to Poland in December 1785, pausing at Hanover with a letter of introduction from George, prince of Wales, who assured his brother Frederick that he and Whitworth were convivial intimates and that &#145;a more gentlemanlike, liberal-minded man never existed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, 1.151). He reached Warsaw on 21 January 1786, and spent two years there during the uneasy reign of Stanislas Poniatowski. Having been ordered to investigate any moves to carve up Poland or Turkey, he obtained little information, though he was sent to Kiev in April 1787 to observe Poniatowski's meeting with the empress of Russia. There he met Catherine, who declined political discussion: he had been authorized to suggest an Anglo-Russian alliance.<br>
<br>In November 1788 Whitworth was transferred to Russia in the same capacity with this objective. He was at first amiably received by the empress. In 1790, however, Russian successes in war against the Turks alarmed Pitt's ministry, which, following Whitworth's advice that Russia was vulnerable, proposed sending an armada to the Baltic to force Catherine to give up the Black Sea port of Ochakov. The empress was defiant, and Whitworth now warned his government of the uncertain prospects of success. He was nevertheless ordered on 27 March 1791 to present Catherine with an ultimatum, only to have it countermanded when Pitt encountered strong opposition in parliament. In June 1791 Whitworth applied to succeed to the Istanbul embassy, which was offered to him in March 1793, whereupon he declined. His impact on the Russo-Turkish peace treaty of Jassy in January 1792 was limited&#151;he had in any case been assisted in negotiations by William Augustus Fawkener. Nevertheless, he was nominated a knight of the Bath on 17 September 1793 and was invested by the empress on 17 November.<br>
<br>The empress's espousal of the counter-revolutionary alliance against France improved Whitworth's position, though his attempts to halt the second partition of Poland in 1793 failed; furthermore, Lord Grenville, the foreign secretary, disliked Catherine's insisting on the restoration of the Bourbon royal family in France. In February 1795 Whitworth negotiated an Anglo-Russian treaty of alliance whereby Russia fielded 65,000 troops in exchange for a British subsidy. Catherine died before its implementation, and the emperor Paul, her successor in 1796, was at first hostile to the alliance, despite professing the contrary to Whitworth. By July 1798 French aggression in Malta had caused the emperor to change his mind, and Whitworth resumed negotiations successfully. In December a provisional alliance, to be joined by Prussia and Austria, was achieved. This was snagged by Prussian aloofness and by subsidy arrangements for Austria, and in March 1799 Whitworth was officially rebuked for his unauthorized negotiations with the Austrian Count Cobenzl, which were supposed in London to have culminated in a signed agreement for a new loan to Austria. This nearly cost him his post, which was offered to Lord Bathurst. He was saved by the intercession of Count Vorontsov, Russian ambassador in London, who perceived that Paul's resentment of Austrian interference might wreck the alliance.<br>
<br>The treaty with Russia was approved by Grenville, and in April, Russian troops were dispatched to the west. Whitworth was rewarded by the emperor with the order of Malta and in July 1799 an Irish peerage was earmarked for him. Later in that year Paul, irritated by British interference in Malta, changed sides again. By 4 April 1800, when he became Baron Whitworth of Newport Pratt, co. Galway, Whitworth was under orders to leave Russia, where Paul snubbed him. Relations between the two countries were in suspense for a year. Whitworth left St Petersburg on 8 June and travelled via Stockholm. On his return to London he presented a modest memorandum on the state of Russia to Grenville, denouncing the unreliability of Paul, contrasted with Catherine. He found employment, in August, as envoy to Denmark, which as a party, like Russia, to the armed neutrality of the north, was resisting British searches of its vessels. He had not succeeded, while in Russia, in deterring the neutrality's threat to British interests, but he was now accompanied by a naval squadron under Vice-Admiral Dickson, which waited in Elsinore (Helsingor) Roads to reinforce his mission. The Danes gave way on 29 August. After returning to England on 27 September 1800, Whitworth was, as promised the previous year, sworn of the privy council on 5 November.<h2>
<a name="Marriage"></a>Marriage</h2>On 7 April 1801 Whitworth married, by special licence at Dorset House, Westminster, Arabella Diana Sackville, the dowager duchess of Dorset (1767&#150;1825), the daughter and coheir of Sir Charles Cope, second baronet, of Brewerne, Oxfordshire, and the widow of his old acquaintance John Frederick, third duke of Dorset. Her mother, Catherine Jenkinson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bishopp (1744&#150;1827), was the second wife of the first earl of Liverpool. They had no children. Thanks to his wife's ample resources, Whitworth's financial future was secured. He had brought home debts from Russia, and further embarrassment in the shape of the Russian Countess Gerbetzov (elsewhere rendered Gerebstov), who claimed to have supported him financially in Russia. She set off for London with her husband, too late to impede the marriage, but not too late, according to Wraxall, to accept &pound;10,000 from the bride for quiet possession of Whitworth, although no surviving evidence corroborates this. Whitworth now had hopes of a peace-making embassy to France, though this was awarded in October 1801 to Lord Cornwallis, with the understanding that Whitworth should proceed to Paris once peace was achieved. He became a deputy lieutenant of Kent on 20 January 1802.<h2>
<a name="MissiontoParis"></a>Mission to Paris</h2>Following the peace of Amiens, Whitworth was duly posted to Paris on 10 September 1802. Arriving on 16 November in receipt of revised and sterner instructions, he was presented on 7 December to the first consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, whose royal pretensions were already rumoured, and his wife to Josephine Bonaparte at St Cloud on the 11th. From January 1803 the British government under Addington was increasingly uneasy about Bonaparte's aggressive foreign policy. After getting nowhere with Talleyrand, the French foreign minister, whom Bonaparte had instructed to be haughty to him, Whitworth was further disappointed in a lengthy interview with Bonaparte on 18 February. Bonaparte accused Britain of breach of treaty for failing, as yet, to evacuate Malta or Egypt. This alleged perfidy spoiled the prospects Bonaparte hinted at of France and Britain carving up the world between them, and was the basis of further criticism by Bonaparte at a public levee on 13 March 1803. Whitworth was not given a chance to make any substantial counter-allegations, though he replied diplomatically, refusing to be browbeaten. British visitors among the 200 persons present were addressed by Bonaparte in between barbs directed at Whitworth, and gave him credit for his patience. Bonaparte, who according to one British witness did not raise his voice, afterwards tried to discredit exaggerated reports of the occasion. Despite an attempt to patch up a settlement over Malta through Joseph Bonaparte and Talleyrand, there was no question of conciliating Napoleon, whose politeness to Whitworth amid the diplomatic corps on 4 April followed his own very unpunctual appearance. It was generally supposed that he wished to delay a complete rupture until his intended invasion of Britain was better prepared. Whitworth was ordered to present a British ultimatum, the terms of which he later criticized. He was prevented by indisposition from meeting Bonaparte again on 1 May and, after several delays in the granting of his passport, left Paris on 12 May, six days before hostilities were resumed by the pre-emptive British declaration of war.<h2>
<a name="Athome18031813"></a>At home, 1803&#150;1813</h2>Although Whitworth hankered after further employment, he was placed at a disadvantage. He had no seat in either house of parliament, though his wife was patron of East Grinstead borough. In 1801 his only political attachment had been to his chief Grenville, and his friends, but in the meantime Grenville, who was unconvinced of Whitworth's abilities, and his cousin Pitt, both out of office, had drifted apart. On 9 May 1804, when Pitt returned to power without Grenville, Whitworth wrote unsuccessfully to the premier seeking employment, if only as joint postmaster-general, asking no salary beyond his current pension. In July 1803 he had, as a local figurehead of resistance to Bonaparte, become lieutenant-colonel of the Holmsdale battalion of 600 infantry volunteers, based on Maidstone. Having settled at Knole since their marriage, he and his duchess, both described by the diarist Joseph Farington as having plain and easy manners, were popular in Kent, and were commended for their charity, notably in providing employment for the elderly poor. In 1805 there was some talk of Whitworth's taking the prince of Wales's livery, but the first indication of advancement came, not during Grenville's ministry of 1806, but from the duke of Portland's, which on 15 April 1807 appointed him a lord at the Board of Trade. As such, he complained to Thomas Lawrence, while sitting for his portrait, about the excessive granting of licences to trade with Napoleonic Europe. He had declined the offer by the foreign secretary, George Canning, of a diplomatic mission to Denmark in September 1807 for private reasons, which gossip confined to distaste for Canning. His prospects changed in 1812 when Lord Liverpool, his mother-in-law's stepson, became premier. On 2 March 1813 he was made a lord of the bedchamber to the king (&pound;1000 a year), and on 3 June 1813 he became viceroy of Ireland (&pound;30,000 a year). This had been declined by the duke of Beaufort and Lord Yarmouth: the former was present when the prince regent ostentatiously toasted Whitworth for his public-spirited acceptance of office. On 14 June he was created a British peer, as Viscount Whitworth of Adbaston, Staffordshire, his ancestral county.<h2>
<a name="ViceroyofIreland18131817"></a>Viceroy of Ireland, 1813&#150;1817</h2>Whitworth was ceremonially installed at Dublin on 26 August 1813 and was created LLD (Dublin) on 23 September. His tenure was made easier by the continuation in office of his predecessor's chief secretary, Robert Peel, and the civil secretary, William Gregory, both of whom found him congenial: Peel, who wished to return to England in 1814, was persuaded by him to remain. In patronage matters he leaned on their experience and insistence on straight dealing, and apart from pensions worth &pound;700 a year for an impoverished sister of his and a nephew's widow, both approved by Peel, he dispensed no personal patronage. Captain Francis Beaufort informed Joseph Farington in 1817 that the viceroy gave &#145;satisfaction to all and [was] popular from the prudence and justice of his administration without the aid of feastings and other such means of acquiring popularity. The Duchess is likewise much liked from her easy and cheerful manner&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 14.5001). He succeeded in dissolving the Catholic board, at a time when it had become unpopular, in 1814, and in the same year he saw through the renewal of the <span class="roman">Insurrection Act</span>, followed by the <span class="roman">Peace Preservation Act</span>, which introduced a constabulary.<br>
<br>The unfortunate death of the duchess's only son, George, the fourth duke of Dorset, on 14 February 1815, after a fall from his horse during a visit to Dublin, led to a leave of absence, during which the three lords justices deputizing for Whitworth were unable to prevent the transfer of 5000 troops from Ireland to Flanders. On his return on 12 May 1815, the deficit was made good by embodying the militia. He was created GCB on 2 June 1815, and on 25 November 1815 was made Baron Adbaston and Earl Whitworth. He had meant to depart after three years, and had threatened to do so in 1816 if an Irish peerage were granted to George Canning, but he agreed to remain until summer 1817 so that arrangements to consolidate the English and Irish treasuries could be concluded. As it was, he was faced with an ominous Irish famine before he left. He regarded the Irish family connections of his successor, Lord Talbot, as a disadvantage to a viceroy, and was relieved when Peel again agreed to extend his stay. He handed over to Talbot on 9 October 1817.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Although he had no taste for further public office, or for the House of Lords, Whitworth remained open to suggestion. In April 1819 he paid an unofficial but stately visit to Paris with the duchess, visiting the restored Bourbons, and was there again in October, <i>en route</i> for Naples, both capitals being political hotspots at the time. He had been high steward of Stratford upon Avon in place of his stepson since 26 January 1816 and became FSA on 18 November 1819. On 19 July 1821 he was assistant lord sewer at George IV's coronation, and later that year, ineffectually, was shortlisted by Lord Liverpool to recommend to the king for the lord chamberlainship. Thereafter he spent most of his time at Knole, which he had embellished and planted, and where he died after three days' illness on 13 May 1825. He was buried at St Nicholas's, Sevenoaks, which he had rebuilt. The duchess was his heir to an estate valued at under &pound;70,000. She died on 1 August the same year, making special provision for the preservation of Knole, where a portrait of Whitworth by Hoppner, a drawing by Edridge, and a bust by Kirk are preserved. A bust by Carew adorns his monumental inscription in St Nicholas's, Sevenoaks. Lawrence's portrait of him is in Paris, at the Louvre.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Whitworth was praised in an obituary as &#145;one of the best examples of an English nobleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 95/2, 1825, 82). There is no doubt that he looked the part, and that he sought to act it. This obituary remarked on similarities between him and his kinsman the first Baron Whitworth, whose papers he deposited at Knole. The latter certainly excelled as a diplomatist, and, while both served in Russia, the first baron wrote a notable account of his experiences there, later published, while Charles junior, whose father had been an author, sent a few pages, coloured by disappointment, to Lord Grenville. His long stay in Russia was fraught with difficulties in dealing with its autocratic rulers, especially with the vacillating Paul, who alternately fawned on him or spurned him, eventually dismissing him with a sense of failure. What nearly led to dismissal by his own government in 1799 was a misjudgement of his own, though its gravity was exaggerated by the slowness of communications between St Petersburg and London, sometimes taking six weeks, and resulting in prior information being received from nearer sources. He was, professionally, dutiful and dogged and, if astute, was at that time not particularly perspicacious.<br>
<br>The rebuke by Bonaparte on 13 March 1803 was the most widely reported event in Whitworth's career, and of course Bonaparte stole a show he had himself devised. In these circumstances, the dignified demeanour of the diplomatist taken off his guard was so frequently acknowledged as to earn him retrospective credit. In 1922 the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy</span> opined that no important negotiations had ever been so mismanaged as those with Bonaparte dictated by Addington and Hawkesbury in 1802&#150;3, but from this censure exempted Whitworth, &#145;who, throughout, tempered firmness with discretion, manliness with extreme forbearance&#146;  (Ward and Gooch, 1.325). Even so, judgements of Whitworth's diplomatic acumen are various. His subsequent progression from an Irish barony to a British earldom excited envy among his peers; yet unlike some of them he could point to public services, both diplomatic and viceregal, which justified it. He could also have pointed to the difficulty caused him by his relative poverty in a farflung diplomatic posting previous to his marriage, when his personal morality was suddenly impugned. The sting was taken out of Countess Gerbetzov's case against him by his wife's resolute backing, but other ladies were less convinced. Mrs Fitzherbert, who had been secretly married to the prince of Wales, told Thomas Creevey in 1805 that Whitworth was a monster, albeit a remorseful one, and hinted darkly that she could tell him far more to make him think so. Lady Bessborough also thought he had treated the Russian countess very badly. If it were true that she, a married woman unhappy with her husband, had spent considerable sums of money on Whitworth in Russia, with a promise of eventual marriage, there would be a case to answer, but doubts were thrown on this story in an article in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> for December 1836, which dubs the lady in question Gerepzov. As the sister of the Empress Catherine's last favourite, Prince Platon Zubov, she might be credited with a role in restoring the humiliated Whitworth to Catherine's favourable attention after the Ochakov crisis, and possibly with obtaining political information for him, perhaps at some expense, but the rest has become unattested speculation.<br>
