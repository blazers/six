<span class="headword">Hilton,  John</span>  (1805&#150;1878), <span class="occ">anatomist and surgeon</span>, eldest son of John and Hannah Hilton, was born in Sible Hedingham, Essex, on 22 September 1805. He was the uncle of the physician Charles Hilton Fagge (1838&#150;1883). Hilton's father, originally of humble circumstances, subsequently engaged in the straw-plaiting industry, purchased brickfields, and built Hilton House in Swan Street, later a general-practice surgery. After attending King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford, Hilton studied in Boulogne, becoming fluent in French, before entering Guy's Hospital, London, as a student in 1824. He became MRCS in 1827 and was appointed anatomy demonstrator in 1828. Many of his meticulous dissections were copied in wax by Joseph Towne at Guy's Hospital, and these copies remained preserved in its Gordon Museum. Hilton's mastery of anatomy enabled him to deduce that the same nerve trunks supplied articulations, their controlling muscles, and overlying skin, to ensure harmonious interaction and, in response to pain, physiological rest for inflamed or injured joints, a concept since known as Hilton's law. For this and research on the superior laryngeal nerve, Hilton was elected FRS in 1839.<br>
<br>One of the original fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1843, Hilton became assistant surgeon to Guy's Hospital in 1844. He was in effect starting his surgical apprenticeship, as until this point he had not been exposed to surgical practice, his work previously being restricted to anatomical dissection and teaching. Hilton became anatomy lecturer at Guy's in 1845 and full surgeon in 1849; he also consulted privately from his home at 10 New Broad Street, City of London. At the Royal College of Surgeons he was elected a council member in 1854, Hunterian professor from 1859 to 1862, and president in 1867, when he gave the Hunterian oration. Hilton's lectures at the college between 1860 and 1862 were published individually in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, and reprinted in 1863 in a collected edition entitled <span class="italic">On the influence of mechanical and physiological rest in the treatment of accidents and surgical disease, and the diagnostic value of pain</span>. This was edited with comments by W. H. A. Jacobson, as <span class="italic">Rest and Pain</span>, in 1876, 1880, 1887, and 1892, and by E. W. Walls and E. E. Philipp in 1950. Hilton wrote: &#145;Rest is the necessary antecedent to the healthy accomplishment of both repair and growth&#146;  (J. Hilton, <span class="italic">Rest and Pain</span>, ed. E. W. Walls and E. E. Philipp, 1950, 6). Reflecting a pivotal interest in nerves, he commented: &#145;I have striven, by agency of a more precise nervous anatomy, to unravel and render patent the meaning of pains which have so often been described as anomalous or obscure.&#146; He concluded: &#145;Pain the monitor, and Rest the cure, are starting-points for contemplation which should ever be present in the mind of the surgeon&#146;  (ibid., 477).<br>
<br>After retirement from Guy's in 1870, Hilton continued in private practice, being appointed surgeon-extraordinary to Queen Victoria and becoming president of the Pathological Society. Hilton, who was twice married, died at Hedingham House, Clapham, London, from a carcinoma of the stomach, on 14 September 1878. He was survived by his second wife, Elizabeth Mary Ann, formerly Clarke, by his stepson Fielding Clarke, and by the children from his first marriage.<br>
<br>In the biographical introduction to the sixth edition of <span class="italic">Rest and Pain</span>, H. J. B. Atkins observed that Hilton's obituary notice in <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span> had appeared only in 1892, with an apology for the delay by Jacobson. Further <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, which had published Hilton's lectures, and the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, printed unduly terse factual obituaries. In explanation Atkins suggested that Hilton may not have had a socially endearing character. None the less his unrivalled knowledge made him a fascinating lecturer and teacher. To be Hilton's dresser at Guy's was considered a &#145;blue riband&#146; of attainment, even if he was no easy master, being rough in speech and prone to sarcasm, with a particular dislike of eponymous terminology. In 1892 S. Wilks and G. T. Bettany reported: &#145;It was his misfortune to say disagreeable things, for he was really a kind-hearted man&#146;  (Wilks and Bettany).<br>
<br>Hilton made many contributions to <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span>, and <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Medical and Chirurgical Society</span> but his name is perpetuated in <span class="italic">Rest and Pain</span>, a classic of medical literature, influencing among others the anatomist F. Wood Jones who encouraged all medical students and practitioners to read it.<br>
