<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stevens,  Alfred George</span>  (1817&#150;1875), <span class="occ">sculptor and designer</span>, was born on 31 December 1817 at Blandford Forum, Dorset, where he was baptized on 28 January 1818, the second son of George Stevens, heraldic painter and house decorator, and his wife, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1869). He was educated in the local village school and showed precocious talent as a painter. In 1833 he went to Italy, where he received some training at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence and in 1841 worked in Rome as an assistant to the major neo-classical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. On his return to England in 1842, he unsuccessfully entered the Palace of Westminster fresco competition and drew illustrations to Homer. In 1845 he was appointed as an instructor in painting and ornament at the Government School of Design at Somerset House, London. His experiences in Italy convinced him that industrial design could not be taught separately from fine art. Following his resignation in 1847, he was commissioned to design bronze doors (1848) for the Geological Museum, London, which for economic reasons were unexecuted. From this period date his first major decorative painting scheme (1846, Deysbrook House, Liverpool), unexecuted designs for the base of Nelson's Column, London, and <span class="roman">Bible</span> and history illustrations and paintings which reflected his lifelong admiration for Michelangelo.<br>
<br>In 1850 Stevens was appointed chief designer to Hoole &amp; Co. of Sheffield, who won a council medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Stevens's hot-air stove and &#145;boy&#146; stove received wide praise. At the 1855 Paris Universal Exhibition Hoole &amp; Co. was awarded a medal of honour and Stevens a silver medal. Until the early 1860s Stevens produced designs in many fields, including those for bowie knives, table-centres, chimney-pieces, street lamps, medals, and majolica. He repeatedly refused to enter into business dealings with manufacturers, probably because of his awkward, undisciplined, and Romantic temperament. The last was reflected in a series of remarkably ambitious but unrealistically expensive interior decoration schemes, including a waiting-room for Queen Victoria at Paddington Station and the dome of the British Museum reading-room (both 1855). Stevens's best-known surviving work of this period is humbler: the twenty-five cast-iron lions (1852) for the railings of the British Museum, later copied in large numbers.<br>
<br>1856 marked a turning point in Stevens's career: he received the two major commissions which occupied the rest of his life&#151;the dining-room decorations for Dorchester House, London (dem. 1929), and the monument to the duke of Wellington (1856&#150;1912) for St Paul's Cathedral, London. The Dorchester House decorations were designed as an ensemble, linking painting, sculpture, furniture, and furnishings alike. While his numerous chalk studies for the ceiling decorations identify him as one of the finest British draughtsmen of the nineteenth century, the actual paintings were never executed. The marble chimney-piece (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), with its Michelangelesque caryatids, was only completed after his death and its cost (&pound;1778) shocked Robert Holford, the patron. Holford's summary of Stevens surely echoed that of other patrons: &#145;I had &hellip; the greatest admiration of his genius as an artist and what he did finish for me is admirable&#146;. He was, Holford believed:<blockquote>a thoroughly honest man and an industrious and hard worker &hellip; but he was so absolutely incompetent to take in the slightest notion of business, and so &hellip; unconscious of the moral duty of not undertaking more than he could perform in some reasonable time, that it really was impossible to deal with him. (Beattie, <span class="italic">Catalogue</span>, 43)</blockquote>The Wellington monument was Stevens's one major public commission. Its 56-year history makes tragic reading, especially in regard to Stevens himself. It is wrong, though, to portray him as a victim of bureaucratic hounding, as admiring biographers, from Walter Armstrong (1881) to Susan Beattie (1975), have consistently done. Rather, he was the victim of his own chronic procrastination and perfectionism, as well as his inability to deal with government patrons.<br>
<br>In the 1856 competition for the monument the Royal Academician William Calder Marshall was declared the winner while Stevens, then virtually unknown as a sculptor, was placed sixth. Stevens owed his promotion to the jury's consideration of how effective the shortlisted designs would look when placed within the context of St Paul's. Further support for his design from two successive surveyors to the fabric, C. R. Cockerell and F. C. Penrose, was crucial. Stevens unwisely agreed to work on a reduced budget and to produce a full-scale model which would be erected <i>in situ</i>. What followed was a long chapter of studies, maquettes, models, mishaps, reassurances about the rate of progress, unanswered letters, and mounting costs. As late as 1870 there was little to show for the monument apart from the full-sized plaster model. The cost overrun was estimated at over &pound;13,000, which was almost as much as Stevens's original budget. The first commissioner of works, A. S. Ayrton&#151;described by Walter Armstrong as someone who &#145;despised art and all its manifestations&#146;  (Armstrong, 36)&#151;terminated Stevens's contract and had his work impounded in November 1870. No other eminent sculptor could be found to inherit the project, which was halted until the architect and writer James Fergusson arranged for Leonard Collmann, the interior decorator, to supervise Stevens. Suffering from poverty, anxiety, and heart disease, Stevens made little further progress. His sudden death in his studio at 9 Eton Villas, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, London, on 1 May 1875 may have been suicide. He was unmarried. He was buried in Highgate cemetery on 5 May 1875.<br>
<br>The main part of the Wellington monument was completed by Hugh Stannus, Stevens's pupil and biographer. It was unveiled in 1878 without its crowning equestrian figure. Following a campaign headed by Frederic Leighton in 1894 and sustained by Stevens's admirer, D. S. MacColl, the monument was completed by John Tweed in 1912. Its grand scale and its dimly lit surroundings, however, render the totality less impressive than its constituent parts. Yet from Stevens's models in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate collection, the inventiveness and grandeur of the two groups of Virtues, <span class="italic">Truth and Falsehood</span> and <span class="italic">Valour and Cowardice</span>, are evident. The former, with its figure of Truth extracting the tongue of Falsehood, mixes Michelangelo with medievalism, while the latter pays intelligent tribute to Michelangelo's <span class="italic">Victory</span> of 1527.<br>
<br>Both works were shown at the Royal Academy in 1876, the year after Stevens's death, and were his sole exhibits there. This at last enabled his significance to receive wider appreciation. The question of his influence on the major movement of the late nineteenth century, the New Sculpture, while admittedly less direct than that of Leighton, Jules Dalou, and Joseph Edgar Boehm, remains problematic. However, Stevens's modest <i>&#339;uvre</i>, as it became more widely known, was repeatedly quoted by such leading sculptors as Thomas Brock, Alfred Drury, and George Frampton. With his passionate belief in the integration of art and design&#151;his motto was &#145;I know of but one Art&#146;&#151;he could also be seen to foreshadow the ideals of the arts and crafts movement.<br>
<br>Alfred Stevens is one of the cult figures of British art. Solitary, shy, and swarthy, he was often mistaken for a Roman Catholic priest. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> observed how he was &#145;insanely devoted to his art&#146; and how &#145;he would destroy model after model and sketch after sketch while he was eating only a crust of bread&#146;  (4 May 1875). Isolated from the mainstream of British sculpture in training, style, and temperament, he was untypical of his age. Yet this tragic isolation contributed to his status. Hugh Stannus described him as &#145;the Master&#146;, while Kenneth Towndrow, writing in 1950, saw his drawings as worthy of hanging beside those of Edgar Degas. Only in recent years, when Victorian sculpture as a whole has been given overdue scholarly assessment, has Stevens lost his reputation as &#145;undoubtedly the finest of Victorian sculptors&#146;  (R. Middleton and D. Watkin, <span class="italic">Neoclassical and 19th Century Architecture</span>, 1980, 262).<br>
