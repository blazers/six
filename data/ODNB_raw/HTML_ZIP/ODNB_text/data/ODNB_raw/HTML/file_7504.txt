<span class="headword">Denys, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1477&#150;1561), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Denys (<i>d</i>. 1498) of Holcombe Burnell, Devon, and Janera, daughter of Philip Loveday of Sneston, Suffolk. Long established in a minor way in Devon, the family was destined to prosper under the younger Thomas, whose legal studies prepared him for a lifetime of crown service. His greatest impact was upon the administration of his own shire. Denys was appointed to the peace commission in Devon in 1504, an honour which he retained until his death, and he assiduously attended quarter sessions. He served as sheriff of Devon no fewer than nine times between 1507&#150;8 and 1553&#150;4, and sat on commissions responsible for musters, the collection of subsidies, and the assessment of church and chantry wealth. His legal advice was valued by many of Devon's monasteries and boroughs, particularly the city of Exeter, which retained Denys for two lengthy stints as its recorder. He was also employed directly by the crown, being thrice auditor of the duchy of Cornwall, and deputy warden of the stannaries by 1512.<br>
<br>For a man like Denys, whose career rested more upon his own wit than on inherited status, the route to such local preferment began at Westminster. Lacking a university education, the ambitious Denys cultivated the law instead. He was probably a member of Lyon's Inn before his admission to the Inner Temple, where he was elected marshal in 1511 and 1514. It was also important for the aspiring shire gentleman to see some military action, and Denys took part in the Tournai campaign of 1513 (which earned him a knighthood the following year); he would return to France in 1544. But real advancement demanded a patron, and for this he turned to the court. By the time of Henry VII's death Denys was a gentleman usher and esquire of the body; but these were relatively lowly positions, and so by 1515 he had found his way into Cardinal Wolsey's household, where he rose to be chamberlain. From 1526 he was also serving the Princess Mary as comptroller, and in due course was retained by Thomas Cromwell, a friendship that was cemented by the marriage of Denys's stepdaughter Francis Murfyn to Cromwell's nephew Richard. Proximity to the monarchy gained him access to the ceremonial display of Tudor royal power. Having borne a banner at Jane Seymour's funeral Denys was among the party that welcomed Anne of Cleves to English soil, and became chancellor of the new queen's household. His growing status was recognized in his election as one of Devon's knights of the shire in 1529, 1539, and 1553 (although details of his time in the Commons are scant) and in orders, subsequently withdrawn, to muster 200 men against the northern insurgents in 1536.<br>
<br>But it is as an administrator in his native shire, and especially as a correspondent of Cromwell, that it is easiest to trace the public career of Sir Thomas Denys. His duties ranged from the mundane (supplying the names of those who had unlawfully constructed weirs) to the politically sensitive, as when in 1538 he examined Gulphinus Abevan, a Breton priest supposedly in the employ of Reginald Pole, who made the alarming claim that the renegade cardinal was at large in England. In 1537 his career almost suffered a major reverse: the government was furious that Denys had concealed a robbery in Devon, and the attorney-general even cited him before Star Chamber. But this was not the case of corruption that it appeared to be. Denys had characteristically opted for local arbitration over the full process of law, and Cromwell accepted his apology. Denys was soon back at work hunting down speakers of seditious words, and was a natural choice to serve on Cromwell's brief council of the west.<br>
<br>By Edward VI's reign Denys was ageing, but he proved a staunch opponent of the south-western rebels of 1549, albeit more conciliatory and less hot-headed than Sir Peter Carew; Denys may have exceeded his brief by promising an end to religious change in order to pacify the commons. His last great act of crown service came when Carew led his own conspiracy against Queen Mary in January 1554. As he had in summer 1553, Denys stood firm for Mary, disproving rumours that he, too, had plotted to prevent Philip of Spain from landing in the west country. But the suspicion remains that his attempts to arrest Carew were calculatedly half-hearted, and that he suffered his countryman and fellow knight of the shire to steal away to France and exile.<br>
<br>As might be expected, Thomas Denys married shrewdly. By 1506 he had selected Anne, twice widowed; one of her previous husbands, Thomas Warley, had been an exchequer official. In 1524 he married another widow, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Angel Donne and previously married to Sir Thomas Murfyn, mayor of London. They had three daughters and five sons, the eldest being Sir Robert (<i>d</i>. 1592), who succeeded his father as MP for Devon in 1555 and served both Mary and Elizabeth as sheriff of Devon. Robert's first marriage, to Mary, daughter of William Blount, fourth Baron Mountjoy, indicates how the standing of the Denys family had risen in Thomas's lifetime.<br>
<br>Denys's religious faith is difficult to pin down. Slandered in Henry VIII's reign as a papist who hung at the sleeves of the conservative marquess of Exeter, Denys nevertheless profited from the dissolution of monasteries and chantries alike, and bought up land in Essex as well as in Devon. In 1536 it was equally his task to examine the bizarre protestant beliefs of the Axminster shoemaker Philip Gammon, and to question the Exeter women whose stout defence of St Nicholas's Priory had ended in a minor riot; Denys ordered that the women be released, perhaps out of sympathy. In religious terms, his most noteworthy act was to supervise the burning for heresy of the Exeter schoolmaster Thomas Benet in January 1532. Benet, whose crime was to post a scroll on the cathedral door identifying the pope as Antichrist, has his place in Foxe's <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> courtesy of the protestant Exonian John Hooker. In sum, Denys's long life witnessed the religious settlements of four Tudor monarchs, and he was loyal to all of them.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas made his will on 13 December 1558; his wife, Elizabeth, was his executor. Since he was by this time an octogenarian, his deputy lieutenancy of Devon and Cornwall that year can have been little more than a titular recognition of his many years of service. Denys died on 18 February 1561, and asked to be buried with neither feasting nor lights, &#145;by cause I will avoide all pompe used aboute my ded corps&#146;. A Devonian to the last, he bequeathed 20<i>s</i>. to the prisoners in Exeter gaol.<br>
