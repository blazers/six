<span class="headword">Parnell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wood; <em>other married name </em>O'Shea]</span>,  Katharine</span>  (1845&#150;1921), <span class="occ">political intermediary and wife of Charles Stewart Parnell</span>, was born on 30 January 1845 at Glazenwood, Essex. She was the thirteenth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29885/', "Sir John Page Wood (1796&#150;1866)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29889/', "Wood, Sir Matthew")</script>], formerly chaplain and secretary to Queen Caroline, a &#145;thoroughgoing Whig&#146;, who was latterly vicar of Cressing in Essex and rector of St Peter's, Cornhill. Her mother was Emma Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Michell (1802&#150;1879), a watercolourist, book illustrator, and romantic novelist (a pursuit which another of her daughters, Anna, came to share). Her uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29901/', "William Page Wood (later Baron Hatherley)")</script> was lord chancellor in Gladstone's first administration and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37000/', "Sir Evelyn Wood")</script>, soldier and colonial administrator, was her brother. She passed her youth at Rivenhall Place, the family home, where a cultured society, including Anthony Trollope, compensated for the lack of a formal education. At Belhus, the country seat of her brother-in-law Sir Thomas Barrett-Lennard, she met <a name="cosubject_35338"></a><span class="headword">William Henry O'Shea</span>  (1840&#150;1905)<span class="occ"></span>. Then a cornet in the 18th hussars, O'Shea was the son of a Limerick-born solicitor who practised in Dublin, and a Catholic. They were married at Brighton on 23 January 1867.<br>
<br>The O'Sheas passed their first year of marriage in Madrid, where William had taken a partnership in his uncle's bank. He next tried his hand at breeding racehorses. Losses, combined with gambling debts, led to bankruptcy. While his affairs were subsequently settled, Katharine's prodigiously wealthy aunt Mrs Benjamin Wood (&#145;Aunt Ben&#146;) took a house for her at Brighton, where Katharine gave birth to a son, Gerard. Residing together in Beaufort Gardens in London, the O'Sheas briefly cut a dash as a married couple. There their second child, Norah, who was to be Katharine's chief support in her declining years, was born. Katharine bore O'Shea a further daughter, Carmen.<br>
<br>The O'Sheas drifted steadily and respectably apart. Katharine became from the middle of the decade the companion of her aunt, whose seclusion at the Lodge, Eltham, was punctuated by the weekly visits of George Meredith, who received a stipend of &pound;300 per annum to read to her from works other than his own, which she did not esteem. Mrs Wood purchased Wonersh Lodge, just across the park, for Katherine. William was at the time spending some eighteen months in Spain on a mining venture, of which Katharine resignedly commented &#145;he always drew up an excellent prospectus&#146;.<br>
<br>In the wake of commercial failure, statesmanship urgently beckoned. O'Shea was returned for County Clare at the 1880 election under a home-rule flag of convenience. The exigencies of his political career resuscitated the marriage to some degree, at least in its public aspect, as he sought to further his prospects with a series of political dinners. Determined to procure the attendance of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21384/', "Charles Stewart Parnell (1846&#150;1891)")</script>, the &#145;uncrowned king of Ireland&#146;, Katharine drove to Westminster with her sister Anna to seek him out. Her memoirs describe the <i>coup de foudre</i> in Palace Yard:<blockquote>He looked straight at me smiling, and his curiously burning eyes looked into mine with wonderful intentness &hellip; In leaning forward in the cab to say good-bye a rose I was wearing in my bodice fell out on my skirt. He picked it up, and touching it lightly with his lips, placed it in his buttonhole. (O'Shea, 1.135&#150;6)</blockquote>Parnell was then thirty-four, she eighteen months older. By October he was writing to her as &#145;my own love&#146;.<br>
<br>Parnell was incarcerated in Kilmainham gaol, Dublin, from 13 October 1881 to 2 May 1882. Thence he continued to correspond with Katharine, perfecting a system of interlineating letters in invisible ink. On 16 February 1882 Katharine gave birth to a daughter, the short-lived Claude Sophie. That the child was Parnell's has never seriously been disputed, although Captain O'Shea may well have believed it to be his own. Parnell, on temporary release from Kilmainham, was at Eltham when Claude Sophie died on 22 April, as was the captain. Katharine bore Parnell two more daughters in each of the ensuing years: Clare (1883&#150;1909), who bore a haunting resemblance to him, and Katharine (1884&#150;1947).<br>
<br>The extent of the deception practised upon O'Shea by his wife and Parnell has long been a vexed question. As early as 1881, O'Shea had, according to Katharine, irately dispatched Parnell's portmanteau from Eltham to Charing Cross Station, and challenged Parnell to a duel (which did not proceed). While O'Shea appears to have been given assurances as to his wife's relations with Parnell, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that their principal value to him was in permitting him to maintain a sedulously cultivated posture of wounded innocence. His character was a curious combination of vanity, calculation, and na&iuml;vety. There was also very possibly an element of willed self-deception at work. Until the end of 1886 he seems to have retained a degree of tenderness towards Katharine, reciprocated by a measure of exasperated fondness that lingers even in her memoirs. Yet the rhythm of his estrangement can be graphed against the seepage into political currency of rumours of his wife's relations with Parnell.<br>
<br>W. H. O'Shea was for Parnell a rapidly escalating political liability. His appetite for <i>haute politique</i> was insatiable, his aptitude negligible. In the negotiations which led to the &#145;Kilmainham treaty&#146;, which permitted Parnell's release, and in the aftermath of the Phoenix Park murders which swiftly followed, O'Shea disported himself with a uniquely provoking combination of arrogance and ineptitude. Parnell thereafter sought to bypass O'Shea in his dealings with Gladstone. Mrs O'Shea displaced her husband as a conduit of Parnell's thinking. Her role developed from that of a confidential amanuensis to Parnell into that of an intermediary, acting at Parnell's close direction, in correspondence and to a very limited extent in person. Gladstone found her businesslike to deal with, and her role as go-between was a convenience both to the prime minister and to the Irish leader. She was important in 1886 in extracting from Parnell and sending to Gladstone the former's &#145;proposed Constitution for Ireland&#146;, on receipt of which in November the latter shortly after drafted a home rule bill. In her memoirs she underscored the role she had played, for the purpose of levelling against the late Liberal leader the crude if understandable charge of hypocrisy in his repudiation of Parnell in the divorce crisis.<br>
<br>In a reckless but astonishingly concentrated display of authority, Parnell imposed O'Shea as the member for Galway in February 1886. The political enmity between Parnell and O'Shea became manifest on the defeat of the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> (on which O'Shea abstained), and the secession of Joseph Chamberlain, whom O'Shea had enlisted as a mentor, from Gladstone's Liberal Party. O'Shea testified against Parnell before the special commission set up in 1887 to inquire <i>inter alia</i> into the authenticity of the letters published by <span class="italic">The Times</span> implicating Parnell in the Phoenix Park murders. Parnell obdurately believed that O'Shea lay behind the forgeries, prompting Henry Labouchere's observation that Parnell went to his grave the only man who did not believe that Richard Pigott had forged <span class="italic">The Times'</span> letters.<br>
<br>The death of Mrs Benjamin Wood (who might have disinherited Mrs O'Shea, had she been touched by scandal) cleared the way for the institution by Captain O'Shea of divorce proceedings on 24 December 1889. She and Parnell pursued an uncertain course, which involved both the levelling of counter-allegations (including one of adultery with Katharine's sister Anna Steele) and the contemplated pursuit of a settlement. The fact that Mrs Wood's will in favour of her had been challenged meant that they were unable to fund the settlement which they, probably too sanguinely, believed could have been achieved. The fixed point in their strategy was Parnell's insistence that once the issue had been engaged there should be a divorce. On 17 November 1890, after two days of damaging and uncontested evidence, W. H. O'Shea obtained a decree nisi of divorce against his wife.<br>
<br>A sordid competition in moralistic fervour underpinned the political argument of the &#145;Parnell split&#146;. Parnell's nationalist opponents in Ireland, marshalled by T. M. Healy, were determined not to be outdone in their denunciations of Parnell by either the dour plangencies of the &#145;non-conformist conscience&#146; or tory derision. Parnell charged that the anti-Parnellites had been overborne by &#145;dictation&#146;. Healy retorted that Parnell had succumbed to the embraces of Katharine O'Shea, the &#145;Brighton banshee&#146;, to whose sinister influence he attributed Parnell's furious quest to reassert his lost supremacy. He lithely parodied Parnell's stance:<blockquote>
<div>She says I must fight for my station,<br>
</div>
<div>Or forfeit her high admiration,<br>
</div>
<div>To obey her will be<br>
</div>
<div>Quite a pleasure for me,<br>
</div>
<div>So sweet is her English dictation.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Assailed in Ireland as &#145;Kitty O'Shea&#146;, Katharine was in some degree shielded by the fact that it was not a name to which she had ever answered: Parnell's familiar names for her were &#145;Katie&#146;, &#145;Wifie&#146;, or &#145;Queenie&#146;. On the death of Mrs Wood the couple moved in to 10 Walsingham Terrace, Brighton, a corner residence which the <span class="italic">Brighton Gazette</span> described as &#145;away from the bustle of the town at a distance from the resorts of men, exposed to south-westerly gales and immediately overlooking the sea&#146;. On the other side the landscape fell away in cornfields towards Shoreham. In the split Parnell spent the weekends campaigning in Ireland and repaired to Brighton during the week. Once the divorce decree was made absolute, they married at the register office at Steyning on 25 June 1891, two days short of Parnell's forty-fifth birthday. The rigours of the split had taken their toll of what had always been a fragile constitution. His wife was by his side when he died at Walsingham Terrace on the night of 6 October 1891.<br>
<br>Katharine survived her second husband's death by thirty years, in remorselessly deteriorating circumstances. While the proceedings in relation to her aunt's estate had been settled, not altogether advantageously, in 1892, the proceeds were later embezzled by a solicitor. Though prey to bouts of what might mildly be termed eccentricity, she retained unbroken the imperiousness of temperament she shared with Parnell. Her fortunes were partially restored by the appearance in 1914 of her <span class="italic">Charles Stewart Parnell: his Love Story and Political Life</span>, published under the name of Katharine O'Shea&#151;which carried the requisite <i>frisson</i> of notoriety&#151;with &#145;Mrs Charles Stewart Parnell&#146; in parentheses and diminutive type. While, evidently at the direction of Gerard, Captain O'Shea was characterized as a wronged husband wholly unaware of her infidelity, the account she gave of her relations with Parnell rendered this inherently improbable. The influence of her son and publishers notwithstanding, her memoirs carry the ring of conviction and her dates when compared with Gladstone's detailed records are usually correct. Certainly the veracity of her account was doubted by none of Parnell's surviving lieutenants (then in late middle age), whose transfixed reading of the text plunged them traumatically back a quarter-century in time and produced (as well as varying degrees of disgust) a startled recall of Parnell's mesmeric power. Her two volumes reinstated&#151;and perhaps even invented&#151;the private Parnell. She insisted that, rather than the profession of love for his colleagues and the Irish people ascribed to him in public myth, his last words were the more impressive &#145;Kiss me, sweet Wifie, and I will try to sleep a little.&#146;<br>
<br>Katharine O'Shea died at 39 East Ham Road, Littlehampton, on 5 February 1921, less than a year before the country she had never visited (but on whose history she had made such an ineffaceable impact) gained its independence. W. H. O'Shea predeceased her on 22 April 1905, at Hove.<br>
