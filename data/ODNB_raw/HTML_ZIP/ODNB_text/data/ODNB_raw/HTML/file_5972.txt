<span class="headword">Collyer,  William Bengo'</span>  (1782&#150;1854), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and religious writer</span>, was born in Deptford, Kent, on 14 April 1782, the only surviving child of a builder, Thomas Collyer, and his wife, Ann. After an education at the Leathersellers' Company School at Lewisham, he entered the Independent Homerton Academy as a scholar in 1798. In 1800 he began his ministry to a small congregation at Peckham, where he was ordained in December 1801. The congregation speedily increased, and, after the chapel had been enlarged several times, it was rebuilt in 1816 and reopened under the name of Hanover Chapel. His preaching attracted members of the nobility and gentry, and even, occasionally, royalty; at the suggestion of the duke of Sussex he was made a DD by Edinburgh University in 1808. In 1813 he was invited to succeed to the pulpit at Salters' Hall Chapel, which, with the agreement of his congregation at Peckham, he accepted in addition to his existing duties. On 20 October 1813 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1828?), the only daughter and coheir of Thomas Hawkes of Lutterworth; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>As well as being a popular evangelical preacher, attracting a fashionable congregation, Collyer was a prolific author. His works included many sermons and hymns, and a series of popular lectures on scriptural subjects, including <span class="italic">Lectures on Scriptural Facts</span> (1807), <span class="italic">Scripture Prophecy</span> (1809), and <span class="italic">Scripture Duties</span> (1819). Several of his hymn compositions entered common use, including &#145;Great God, what do I see and hear&#146;, on the last judgment, first published in a Sheffield collection of <span class="italic">Psalms and Hymns</span> (1802) and &#145;Return, O wanderer, return&#146; (first published in the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> in May 1806). His <span class="italic">Hymns Partly Collected and Partly Original</span> (1812) included fifty-seven of his own compositions intended for the use of his congregation. Most were &#145;short descriptive or didactic poems, religious or moral essays in verses&#146;  (Julian, 243), and others were composed to accompany his sermons. In 1823 he published, in seven volumes, <span class="italic">Lectures on the Evidences of Divine Revelation</span>. With James Baldwin Brown and Thomas Raffles, he edited the <span class="italic">Investigator</span>, published from 1820 to 1824 to combat vice and irreligion, especially in high society. He was involved in missionary societies, including the conversionist London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. In August 1823 he published a letter and evidence refuting damaging rumours arising from his practice of physically examining youths and young men applying for medical relief, especially for the treatment of hernias. He pointed to his serious study of anatomy at Borough Hospital, and the importance of establishing the extent of their physical symptoms before referring them to the relevant charities, such as the City of London Truss Society, as well as various factual inaccuracies in the allegations against him. A numerous congregation attended his first service after the circulation of his statement, to indicate their support for him, and he continued to preach at the Hanover Chapel until 11 December 1853. He died on 9 January 1854 at 5 Rye Lane, Peckham, and was buried at Nunhead on 16 January.<br>
