<span class="headword">Bankes,  George</span>  (1787&#150;1856), <span class="occ">politician and lawyer</span>, was born on 1 December 1787, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1287/', "Henry Bankes (1757&#150;1834)")</script> of Kingston Lacy, Dorset, who represented Corfe Castle for nearly fifty years, and of Frances (1760/61&#150;1823), daughter of William Woodley, governor of the Leeward Islands. He was a lineal descendant of Sir John Bankes, chief justice of the common pleas in the reign of Charles I. Bankes was educated at Westminster School (1795&#150;1803). He attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1805, graduating LLB in 1812; he was a fellow there from 1814 to 1822. He studied law first at Lincoln's Inn and in 1815 at the Inner Temple, being called to the bar that year. Practising on the western circuit, he unexpectedly was offered the seat of Corfe Castle and joined his father as its second tory representative until 1823. He was again returned for Corfe Castle in 1826, and sat until 1832, when the family borough was united with that of Wareham. He was appointed one of the bankruptcy commissioners in 1822, and cursitor baron of the exchequer in 1824 (he was the last holder of this office, abolished on his death). In 1829, under the Wellington administration, he became chief secretary of the Board of Control, and in the next year a junior lord of the Treasury and one of the commissioners for the affairs of India. At the general election in 1841 he again entered parliament, being returned by the county of Dorset, for which he continued to sit until his death. He opposed repeal of the corn laws, arguing that the &#145;whole class&#146; of tenants would be &#145;swept away&#146;  (Crosby, 140). During Derby's administration in 1852, Bankes held the office of judge-advocate-general and was sworn a privy councillor.<br>
<br>On 8 June 1822 he married Georgina Charlotte Nugent, whose supposed father was Admiral Sir Charles Edmund Nugent but whose real father was probably Ernest, duke of Cumberland. They had three sons and five daughters; six of the children died in childhood. On the death of his maverick elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1290/', "William John Bankes")</script>, in 1855, Bankes succeeded to the family estates of Kingston Lacy and Studland in Dorset. He died at his London house in Old Palace Yard, Westminster, on 8 July 1856 and was buried at Studland, where a stained-glass window is dedicated to his memory. Bankes was the author of <span class="italic">The Story of Corfe Castle and of Many Who Have Lived There</span> (1853) (he was thrice mayor of Corfe Castle) and of <span class="italic">Brave Dame Mary</span>, a work of fiction founded on the <span class="italic">Story</span>.<br>
