<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies, Sir  (Henry) Walford</span>  (1869&#150;1941), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born on 6 September 1869 in Willow Street, Oswestry, Shropshire, the seventh child and fourth surviving son of John Whitridge Davies (<i>d</i>. 1885), accountant, and his wife, Susannah, daughter of Thomas Gregory, jeweller. After attending Mr Owen's school in Willow Street, Oswestry, he was admitted a chorister at St George's Chapel, Windsor, in January 1882 under Sir George Elvey (who was succeeded only months later by Walter Parratt). In February 1885 he left the choir when his voice broke, but he quickly returned in May as assistant organist and secretary to Dean Randall Davidson. In order to eke out a living he secured a series of organist appointments in London&#151;Park Chapel (1885&#150;90), St George's, Campden Hill (1890), St Anne's, Soho (1890&#150;91) and Christ Church, Hampstead (1892&#150;7)&#151;which culminated with the Temple Church in 1898. In 1885 he became acquainted with Mr and Mrs Thomas Matheson of 15 Cannon Place, Hampstead, the venue of the Hampstead Popular Concerts. A lifelong friendship developed, notably with Mrs Matheson (the &#145;M. G. M.&#146; of many dedications), who, as mentor, undertook Davies's education in earnest. He entered for the Cambridge MusB in 1889, but his exercise (a cantata, <span class="italic">The Future</span>, to words by Matthew Arnold) failed the following year. However, Sir Charles Stanford strongly urged him to re-enter and the exercise was passed in 1891. In 1890 he gained a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music, where he studied composition under Sir Hubert Parry (with a brief interlude under Stanford in 1893), modal counterpoint under W. S. Rockstro, piano with Herbert Sharpe, and the violin (later) with Haydn Inwards. Owing to the tuition he had enjoyed under Parratt at Windsor he declined to study the organ. When his scholarship ended in March 1894 he undertook some counterpoint teaching for Gladstone, and when Rockstro died in 1895 he was appointed teacher of counterpoint, a post he retained until 1903, though not without some scruple. In 1896 he failed the counterpoint paper for the Cambridge MusD, and though he passed it in 1897, Stanford (professor of music at the university) had nevertheless informed him of its shortcomings. Davies thought of offering his resignation to Parry (who was by now director of the Royal College of Music), but he was persuaded to reconsider. Matters did not improve when his doctoral exercise, a short oratorio <span class="italic">The Days of Man</span>, was initially rejected. Davies was openly critical of Cambridge, which naturally infuriated its professor, Stanford. On the acceptance of Stanford's corrections Davies was forced to apologize, but his relations with Stanford remained strained for some years to come. He proceeded to the MusD in 1898.<br>
<br>On his appointment as organist at the Temple Church in 1898, one which he held for the next twenty-one years, Davies's position in British musical life began to assume greater prominence. He conducted the London Church Choirs' Association (1901&#150;13), succeeded Stanford as conductor of the London Bach Choir (1902&#150;7), and became well known as an organist (particularly as an exponent of Parry's late organ works) and as a teacher (his most famous pupil being Leopold Stokowski). During the war years he was initially involved with the Music in Wartime movement, but gave this up for a more musically active role, organizing concerts for the troops in France and assisting with musical events for the Fight for Right movement (which included the commissioning of Parry's choral hymn &#145;Jerusalem&#146;). In 1918 he was raised to the rank of major in the RAF.<br>
<br>Davies's connection with Wales began in 1919 when he was appointed professor of music at University College, Aberystwyth, and chairman of the National Council of Music for the University of Wales. He resigned the former in 1926 but retained the latter post until his death. The resignation of his position at the Temple in 1923 opened the way the following year for further career opportunities, including his appointment as Gresham professor of music (succeeding Sir Frederick Bridge) and a long association with radio, marked by the Cramb lectures from Glasgow, broadcast for the first time from Savoy Hill. Moreover, at the age of fifty-four, on 4 September 1924, he married (Constance) Margaret Isabel Evans (<i>b</i>. 1898), daughter of William Evans, canon of St David's and rector of Narberth; she was twenty-eight years his junior. On his appointment as a musical adviser for the BBC in 1926 Davies became well known for his programmes such as <span class="italic">Music and the Ordinary Listener</span> (1926&#150;9), his wartime children's broadcasts (1939&#150;41), and <span class="italic">Everyman's Music</span> (1940&#150;41). Between 1927 and 1932 he was organist at St George's Chapel, Windsor, after which he retired from full-time work, though he continued to be active as a lecturer, broadcaster, writer (his book <span class="italic">The Pursuit of Music</span> was published in 1935), conductor, and adviser, not least in his role as master of the king's musick after Elgar's death in 1934. In recognition of his services to music in Britain he was knighted in 1922, having already been made OBE in 1919. He was created CVO in 1932 and was promoted to KCVO in 1937, in part owing to his role in the musical organization of the coronation of King George VI. He also accepted honorary degrees from Leeds (LLD, 1904), Glasgow (LLD, 1926), Dublin (MusD, 1930), and Oxford (DMus, 1935) and was made a fellow of the Royal College of Organists (1904), the Royal Academy of Music (1923), and the Royal College of Music (1926). At the outbreak of the Second World War he moved to Bristol to be with the BBC's department of religion. He died at Glencairn, Wrington, near Bristol, on 11 March 1941, and after a funeral service at Bristol Cathedral on 14 March his ashes were laid in the cathedral garden.<br>
<br>As a composer Davies was profoundly influenced by Brahms (whom he met at Ischl in 1896) and even more so by Parry, who lies behind the corpus of chamber works and a symphony from Davies's student days, and whose neo-Bachian, ethical preoccupations can be felt in the series of large-scale choral works&#151;namely <span class="italic">The Temple</span> (Worcester, 1902), <span class="italic">Everyman</span> (Leeds, 1904), <span class="italic">Lift up your Hearts</span> (Hereford, 1906), <span class="italic">Noble Numbers</span> (Hereford, 1909), and the <span class="italic">Song of St Francis</span> (Birmingham, 1912)&#151;written during the heyday of his career as a festival composer before the First World War. Yet Davies did not live up to his early promise (which enjoyed its zenith in <span class="italic">Everyman</span>) and his career as a composer fell away after the war. His name is still familiar to church musicians and to educators, but he is best remembered today as a miniaturist, for his <span class="italic">Solemn Melody</span> (1908), written for the Milton tercentenary celebrations, the introit &#145;God be in my head&#146; (from <span class="italic">Songs of Church and Home</span>, 1908), an attractive version of &#145;O little town of Bethlehem&#146;, a frequently sung carol arrangement of &#145;The holly and the ivy&#146;, and the <span class="italic">RAF March Past</span> (1921). These pieces best show Davies as the professional composer of <i>Gebrauchsmusik</i>, but the intensity of expansive lyricism, organic construction, and harmonic adventure, such as one finds in his sadly neglected early setting for baritone and string quartet of Browning's &#145;Prospice&#146;, op. 6 (written after a life-threatening attack of peritonitis in 1890), provides a glimpse of a powerful symphonic imagination that he failed to consolidate in his later works.<br>
