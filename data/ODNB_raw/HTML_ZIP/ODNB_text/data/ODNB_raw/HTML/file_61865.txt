<span class="headword">Gambarini <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Chazal]</span>,  Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [Elisabetta  de Gambarini]</span>  (1730&#150;1765), <span class="occ">composer, keyboard player, and singer</span>, was born on 7 September 1730 in Holles Street, St Marylebone, Middlesex, the third of the four children of Charles Gambarini (<i>d</i>. 1754) and his wife, Joanna (Giovanna Paula) Stradiotti (<i>d</i>. 1774). She seems to have been the only sibling to have survived to maturity. Her parents had probably arrived in London from Italy by 1726, when a sale of &#145;Mr Gambarini's entire collection&#146; was advertised  (BL, S.C. 222 (4, 5)). The baptismal records for the Gambarini children are unusually helpful in revealing the parents' origin and social status, Elizabeth's showing that her father was a nobleman from Lucca and her mother a woman of similar status from Dalmatia. She described her father as &#145;Librarian, Antiquarian and Counsellor to the late Landgrave of Hess Cassel&#146;  (Gambarini, proposal to the Royal Society and accompanying letter to Dr Birch, BL, Add. MS 4308, fol. 13); he is almost certainly the &#145;Conte Carlo Gambarini&#146; who published <span class="italic">A Description of the Earl of Pembroke's Pictures</span> (1731), and the &#145;G-mb-r-ni, the Picture-monger&#146; mentioned in the anonymous pamphlet <span class="italic">Do you know what you are about, or, A protestant alarm to Great Britain</span> (1733, 21). Her mother may have been a tutor to the nobility: a letter from Elizabeth to Lord Bute in 1761 notes, &#145;My Mamma had the honour of teaching Lady Bute [Mary Wortley Montagu] when she was about fourteen years of age&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5726 D, fols. 22&#150;23<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Elizabeth began her career in the mid-1740s as a singer in Handel's oratorio productions. By 1748 her developing reputation enabled her to promote her own benefit concert, in which she sang and played some of her own compositions on the organ, and to issue her first two volumes of music. The <span class="italic">Six Sets of Lessons for the Harpsichord</span> was the first collection of keyboard music to be published by a female composer in Britain, and contains a lengthy and illustrious list of subscribers. The music is charming, in the new Italian mould rather than traditionally Handelian, and full of imaginative strokes. The success of this volume seems to have prompted the production of the second later in the year. As a frontispiece to <span class="italic">Lessons for the Harpsichord Intermix'd with Italian and English Songs</span> there is an engraving of Gambarini by Nathaniel Hone, showing her sitting at a desk composing. This engraving is the source of the usual, incorrect, date of birth for the composer.<br>
<br>Gambarini issued her final publication, <span class="italic">XII English &amp; Italian Songs</span>, in 1750; after this there is little indication of public musical activity until 1760 and 1761, when she gave a number of benefit concerts, appearing as composer, harpsichordist, organist, and singer. Her letter to Lord Bute quoted above shows that at the same time she sought a court appointment, and she later attempted to sell her father's collection of paintings to the Royal Society.<br>
<br>On 20 March 1764 Elizabeth married Etienne Chazal at St Martin-in-the-Fields. She gave one concert as Mrs Chazal in May, but died at her home in Castle Court, Strand, in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, less than a year later, on 9 February 1765. She was buried at St James's, Westminster, on 14 February. Her mother's will reveals that Elizabeth had a daughter, Giovanna Georgiana Chazal. Elizabeth may have died in or as a result of childbirth. Nothing more is known of either her husband or her daughter.<br>
<br>Henry Bromley's <span class="italic">Catalogue of Engraved British Portraits</span> (1793, 310) and a note against Gambarini's signature in BL, Add. MS 5726 B, fol. 31<i>v</i> claim that Elizabeth was also a painter. In recording her death, the <span class="italic">Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser</span> (11 February 1765) observed that she used to exhibit pictures at her home.<br>
