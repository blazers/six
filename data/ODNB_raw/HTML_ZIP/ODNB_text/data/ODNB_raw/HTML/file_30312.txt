<span class="headword">Nassau van Zuylestein,  William Henry  van</span>, fourth earl of Rochford  (1717&#150;1781), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was born on 17 September 1717 at St Osyth Priory, Essex, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30310/', "Frederick van Nassau van Zuylestein, third earl of Rochford (1682/3&#150;1738)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30313/', "Nassau van Zuylestein, William van")</script>], courtier and landowner, and his wife, Elizabeth (Bessy) Savage (1698/9&#150;1746), illegitimate daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24723/', "Richard Savage, fourth Earl Rivers")</script>. Rochford was the first English-born son of a Dutch court family ennobled by William III in 1695. His childhood was spent at St Osyth, with occasional visits to the family's estates in Holland. He was educated at Eton College (1725&#150;32), then spent several years in Switzerland, from where he returned fluent in French.<br>
<br>Rochford succeeded to the earldom in June 1738 and was appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber to George II on &pound;1000 a year. In 1741 he inherited Easton in Suffolk from his uncle Henry Nassau, and in May 1742 he married Lucy (<i>c</i>.1723&#150;1773), daughter of Edward Younge of Durnford, Wiltshire. They had no children. As a young courtier in London, Rochford lived at 48 Berkeley Square. He formed a lifelong friendship with the actor David Garrick, and their correspondence reveals Rochford as a cheerful optimist with a lively sense of humour and a passionate devotion to the theatre, music, and dancing. Rochford had no interest in political intrigue, and decided that he could best serve his king by becoming an ambassador. Thanks to the patronage of the duke of Cumberland, Rochford was duly appointed envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to the court of Turin, the highest rank in the service short of ambassador. He and Lucy arrived at Turin on 9 September 1749.<h2>
<a name="EnvoytoTurin"></a>Envoy to Turin</h2>Savoy-Sardinia was the most important of the Italian states for British foreign policy in the eighteenth century, yet Turin was not an easy post for a novice diplomat, as France and Austria did their utmost to counteract British influence over Charles-Emmanuel III. Rochford went to great lengths to gain the king's ear, often riding out to hunt with him before breakfast. He was popular at the court of Turin, where he fostered the fashion for English country dances. His early advocacy of English interests in Savoy was successful, and he maintained close links with British consuls in the region. He played a useful role in negotiations leading to the treaty of Aranjuez (1752), and the neutrality of Savoy-Sardinia during the Seven Years' War must be credited in part to his careful cultivation of friendship between Turin and London.<br>
<br>Rochford went on a tour of Italy in 1753, and employed a secret agent in Rome to report on the movements of the Young Pretender. Confessing himself &#145;excessively curious&#146; for plants and herbs, he made several expeditions into the Alps from Turin, sending seedlings back to St Osyth. On his return home on leave in 1754 he brought with him a Lombardy poplar sapling, tied to the centre-pole of his carriage. The poplars at St Osyth were long regarded as the earliest in England.<br>
<br>Rochford was recalled from Turin to replace Albemarle as groom of the stole on 2 March 1755. A week later he was sworn of the privy council. In April 1756 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Essex, and in November 1759 colonel of the Essex militia. Much of his time during the Seven Years' War was spent on militia exercises and Essex elections. In London he renewed his friendship with Garrick and cultivated new ones with Richard Rigby, the earl of Sandwich, Viscount Barrington, and the earl of Holdernesse. In 1758 Rochford and Lucy nearly separated after quarrelling over his affair with an expensive Italian opera dancer and her affair with Lord Thanet. They were reconciled, and Rochford chose a less expensive mistress in Martha Harrison of the parish of St George's, Hanover Square, with whom he had a daughter, Maria Nassau, soon after. When George II died on 24 October 1760, Rochford as groom of the stole was entitled to the contents of the king's bedroom, but settled for &pound;3000 in cash, a breeches <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and a bed quilt which long served as an altar cloth in the church at St Osyth. He yielded office with such good grace that he won George III's favour and an Irish pension of &pound;2000 a year. Rochford fell seriously ill in April 1763 and was still convalescing when he was named ambassador to Spain on 18 June 1763.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadortoMadrid"></a>Ambassador to Madrid</h2>Rochford reached Madrid on 6 December 1763. As at Turin, he had to deal with a widower king, but Charles III was not friendly towards Britain, and most of his ministers were strongly Francophile. Madrid was a key post in 1763, as British ministers feared a war of retaliation by the powers of the Family Compact, to recover their losses in the Seven Years' War. A major task of Rochford's embassy was to obtain naval and military intelligence, which he addressed with his customary diligence. He wrote over 400 dispatches from Madrid, and his figures for Spanish naval expansion were more accurate than those sent to Choiseul by the French ambassador. Rochford worked closely with the British consul-general in Spain, Stanier Porten, uncle of the historian Edward Gibbon, and made &#145;Frequent applications &hellip; for His Majesty's trading Subjects&#146;  (Rice, &#145;Diplomatic career&#146;, 319). His success in an early dispute over British logwood cutters in Honduras gave him a reputation as a tough anti-Bourbon. This did not help his major negotiation over the Manila Ransom, which remained unresolved when he left Madrid. At Madrid Rochford befriended the playwright Beaumarchais, and recommended his plays to Garrick. After witnessing the Madrid riots of March 1766 which brought down Squilace, Rochford was named ambassador to Paris on 1 July 1766. It is said that he had to pawn his plate and jewels for &pound;6000 to settle his debts before leaving Madrid on 15 May 1766.<br>
<br>Rochford insisted on taking Porten with him to Paris as his secretary of embassy, the start of a close working relationship which lasted until Rochford's retirement. At Paris from 28 October 1766 to 1 September 1768, Rochford was dean of the British diplomatic service, and kept in regular touch with other senior diplomats across Europe as well as leading politicians at home. While he could claim success in several minor negotiations over Dunkirk, the Canada bills, and the English East India Company, the two major crises of his Paris embassy were humiliating failures. The French foreign minister, Choiseul, regarded Rochford as evasive and anti-French after a proposal to resolve the first Falkland Islands dispute of 1766 by linking it to the Manila Ransom was bungled by the British secretary of state, Lord Shelburne. Much more serious was France's secret annexation of Corsica in 1768, about which Rochford had given only general warnings. The British cabinet was too weak and divided to support his strong stand at Paris. He also had the bad luck to fall seriously ill for two weeks at the most critical phase of the crisis. Feeling angry and betrayed, he returned to England to demand a cabinet post. The duke of Newcastle described Rochford as &#145;the fittest for it of any man in England&#146;. Rochford was finally named secretary of state for the northern department on 21 October 1768.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstateforthenorth"></a>Secretary of state for the north</h2>This appointment puzzled contemporaries, for Rochford's diplomatic experience lay in the southern department's sphere: some saw it as deference to Choiseul, but in fact it was because Viscount Weymouth wanted the more important of the two secretaryships. Foreign diplomats in London found Rochford more accessible and better informed than his predecessors, while British diplomats abroad were relieved and delighted to be instructed by an experienced former ambassador. As northern secretary (1768&#150;70) Rochford was particularly scrupulous in his conduct of the routine correspondence and gave more coherence to British foreign policy than had been evident during the Chatham administration. The top priority at this time was the pursuit of a Russian alliance. As Michael Roberts has shown (<span class="italic">British Diplomacy</span>), the key post for this campaign was Stockholm, where Rochford sent large sums of money to Sir John Goodricke to help Russian attempts to influence the Swedish diet. Britain could have had the Russian alliance for the price of a large subsidy, but Rochford finally decided it was not worth the money. This decision was a realistic one in 1770, but it left Britain without a continental ally on the eve of the American war.<br>
<br>While Rochford was busy with northern Europe, Weymouth gave Choiseul the clear impression that Britain would do anything to avoid another war at sea, and France therefore supported Spain in a much more serious dispute with Britain in 1770, that over the Falkland Islands. Weymouth's stance suddenly changed to one of inflexible belligerence. As military preparations quickened and the diplomatic situation remained deadlocked, the risk of war between Britain and the Bourbon powers came closer to flashpoint than at any time since the Seven Years' War. Indeed, historians suspect that Weymouth and his ambitious under-secretary Wood wanted to provoke war in order to collapse North's ministry and reinstate Chatham. George III and North now took personal control of the crisis, assisted by Rochford. North proposed that, in return for Spain's apology and reinstatement of the British garrison on the Falklands, Britain would give a secret verbal promise to abandon the islands some time in the near future. While the rest of the cabinet endorsed this solution, Weymouth rejected it and resigned. Rochford replaced him as southern secretary (19 December 1770) and took charge of the diplomatic negotiations. The crisis was resolved when Louis XV dismissed Choiseul, and Charles III realized that Spain could not fight Britain alone. It was Rochford's idea that the three powers disarm simultaneously. The formal agreement ending the crisis was signed on 22 January 1771, just one hour before parliament reassembled, but rumours of the secret promise made North and Rochford extremely unpopular with a jingoistic opposition and their London supporters.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstateforthesouth"></a>Secretary of state for the south</h2>As southern secretary (1770&#150;75) Rochford's workload increased considerably. Besides maintaining an extensive correspondence with British diplomats in Portugal, Spain, France, Switzerland, the Italian states, and elsewhere, this department had many domestic responsibilities (before the 1782 rationalization into Home and Foreign offices) as well as oversight of Ireland and the East India Company. Rochford's name appears on nearly every page of volumes 3 and 4 of the massive <span class="italic">Calendar of Home Office Papers of the Reign of George III</span>. He was now part of the inner core of North's cabinet, where he got on well with Gower and Sandwich, but disliked Suffolk and Dartmouth. Rochford was the foreign policy expert, but was too nervous a speaker to be an effective spokesman in the House of Lords. Sandwich once described one of his cabinet papers on the current situation in Europe as the best he had seen in all his years in office.<br>
<br>George III was clearly fond of Rochford for his &#145;many amiable qualities&#146;, but he was also aware of his limitations, his extravagance, and occasional indiscretions. The king once remarked to North that Rochford's &#145;Zeal makes him rather in a hurry&#146;, and to Suffolk that Rochford was at times &#145;not very prudent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 2.369&#150;72). Yet in 1771 the king told Porten that Rochford, despite poor health, was &#145;more active and had more Spirit&#146; than anyone else in the cabinet  (Porten MSS, &#145;Notes of interview with the king&#146;, 23 June 1771) which is perhaps why he relied on Rochford as his go-between in the painful negotiations with his brother, the duke of Gloucester, after the <span class="roman">Royal Marriages Act</span> of 1772. This episode gave Rochford a bitter and influential enemy in the diarist Horace Walpole, for the duke's wife was Walpole's niece. In his memoirs, Walpole deliberately belittled Rochford as &#145;a man of no abilities and of as little knowledge, except in the routine of office&#146;  (Walpole, 3.168), a spiteful remark which too many historians have accepted uncritically.<br>
<br>Despite his anti-Bourbon reputation, Rochford saw that the balance of power in Europe had changed with the emergence of Russia as a major power, as shown by the 1772 partition of Poland, and warned that this &#145;changed absolutely the System of Europe&#146;. He therefore initiated secret negotiations for friendlier relations with France, a bold, imaginative, but risky policy which stalled in the aftermath of the Swedish Revolution of 1772. In public, of course, he had to maintain a resolutely anti-Bourbon stance, to placate the parliamentary opposition. Rochford wrote to Gower in characteristic vein on 10 October 1772:<blockquote>We are determined to let France know that we will not be bambouzled; I hope we shall not shew our teeth without biting, though I believe it will not be necessary, for I am sure if we are <i>firm and temperate</i> we may yet keep all quiet. (Rochford to Gower, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/29/1/14)</blockquote>George III shared Rochford's broader view of British diplomacy, and respected his experience and judgement, but Rochford's volatile temperament and verbal vivacity often led him into indiscreet conversations with foreign diplomats.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>By the spring of 1775 it was clear that Britain faced a serious colonial rebellion in North America. News of the Bunker Hill engagement reached London in late July, and forced North's government to recognize that Britain would have to fight a costly war at a great distance to keep control of her colonies. Rochford's policy of friendlier relations with the Bourbon powers now paid dividends, at least for a short time, by helping to keep France and Spain out of the conflict. Peace in Europe was vital for British success in America. The eventual American victory was mainly because Britain's resources were diverted after 1778 to the larger conflict at sea with France and Spain.<br>
<br>Rochford himself favoured a negotiated solution to Britain's problems in the American colonies, but this brought him into conflict with his brother-secretary Suffolk, who favoured a hardline military solution. They clashed over Suffolk's scheme to hire troops from Russia, and over a minor <i>faux pas</i> by the British charg&eacute; d'affaires in Paris; Rochford's claim that he knew more about diplomacy than Suffolk was confirmed by no less a person than the Spanish ambassador, Masserano. But Rochford's failing health and increasing isolation in cabinet led him to offer his resignation in October 1775. As he left office, Rochford urged a treaty of guarantee among the European powers, to deprive the colonists of foreign aid: such a guarantee &#145;would conquer America sooner than 20,000 soldiers&#146;. Britain's foreign policy towards the Bourbons in the first years of the war followed the lines set by Rochford, and certainly helped delay the involvement of France and Spain in the American war. At his retirement Rochford was granted a pension of &pound;2500 a year, later increased to &pound;3320. His departure from office was clouded by a blunder in drawing up a warrant for the arrest of an opposition pamphleteer, Stephen Sayre, who brought a successful action against Rochford in June 1776.<br>
<br>Lady Rochford died on 9 January 1773 and was buried at St Osyth. Rochford's daughter Maria Nassau had lived with them in Paris in 1767 and since at St Osyth. Rochford by then had two children with Anne Labb&eacute;e Johnstone, who now came to live with him at St Osyth. In 1776 Rochford was made master of Trinity House, and visited his estates in Holland. He was elected a KG on 3 June 1778. George III twice visited St Osyth, and presented Rochford with portraits of himself and Queen Charlotte by Allan Ramsay. In his last years Rochford was involved as lord lieutenant in preparations to defend the coast against a threatened French invasion. Commanding a camp of militia at Fingringhoe in 1781 he caught a fever, and returned to St Osyth where he lay ill for three weeks until his death on 28 September aged sixty-four. His will disposed of landed property yielding an income of &pound;2000 a year. The earldom passed to his bachelor nephew, at whose death in 1830 the title became extinct.<br>
<br>Rochford was certainly no Walpole, much less a Chatham, but he has suffered undeserved neglect as a member of the most reviled British cabinet of the eighteenth century. Nicholas Tracy has described Rochford as &#145;one of the stronger men of the period, ranking with Sandwich in his professionalism within his department&#146;  (N. Tracy, <span class="italic">Navies, Deterrence and American Independence</span>, 1988, 43). In his chosen profession Rochford proved himself an exceptionally diligent and effective diplomat, outwitting his French counterpart at Madrid and earning the grudging respect of Choiseul for his spirited opposition to Bourbon rearmament. Of the nine secretaries of state who controlled British foreign policy between 1763 and 1775, Rochford was the only career diplomat and former ambassador. Recent research has shown that as secretary of state he achieved as much as anyone could reasonably expect in a period of unusually difficult circumstances for Britain in Europe. He restored unity and direction to a foreign policy which had virtually collapsed in 1768, and pursued the Russian alliance as far as it was realistic to do so. It may be argued that without Rochford's skill and experience British foreign policy might have suffered worse humiliations in the period 1763&#150;75. His more conciliatory policy towards Spain after 1771 drove a wedge into the Family Compact which delayed Spanish involvement in the American war. Hamish Scott's judgement that Rochford was &#145;the ablest man to control foreign policy in the first decade of peace [after 1763], a statesman of intelligence, perception and considerable application, though perhaps lacking patience and tact&#146; remains a fair and accurate assessment  (Scott, &#145;Anglo-Austrian relations&#146;, 9).<br>
