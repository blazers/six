<span class="headword">Vernon,  George</span>  (1637/8&#150;1720), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Bunbury, Cheshire; his parents are unknown, but he was apparently unrelated to the great local dynasties of that name. His date of birth is derived from his age at matriculation and from his statement made in a deposition in 1670 that he was then thirty-two. He was admitted a servitor at Brasenose College, Oxford, matriculating in March 1654, aged sixteen, graduating BA in October 1657, and proceeding MA in July 1660. He took holy orders and became chaplain of All Souls, Oxford. In 1663 he was appointed rector of Sarsden in Oxfordshire. Subsequently Vernon was presented to the rectory of St Lawrence's at Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire, a wealthy living of which he purchased the advowson, and to which his family continued to present until 1682.<br>
<br>The parish had a troubled recent history: of Vernon's predecessors, Temple, its priest at the commencement of the civil war, &#145;had been involved in scandalous suits &hellip; and actively resisted sequestration&#146;, while his successor, Anthony Palmer, &#145;a prominent Congregationalist&#146;, was ejected at the Restoration  (<span class="italic">VCH Gloucestershire</span>, 6.46). Thereafter, Bourton was a prominent centre for dissenters, both Catholic and protestant: figures for 1667&#150;76 suggest that the parish contained &#145;a higher proportion and a far higher number of Protestant dissenters than anywhere else in Stow deanery&#146; and that &#145;half the papists were &hellip; gathered there&#146;. A John Dunce, possibly the rector of Condicote during the interregnum, was preaching at Bourton in 1667 and was granted a licence for a meeting there in 1672; the lord of the manor, Charles Trinder, was a prominent Roman Catholic who housed chaplains of his faith  (ibid., 6.47). These remarkable local circumstances probably best explain the beleaguered and often vituperative tone of the series of writings in defence of the theological and legal foundations of Anglican intolerance that followed Vernon's appointment.<br>
<br>The first of these, the anonymous <span class="italic">A Letter to a Friend Concerning some of Dr Owen's Principles and Practices</span> (1670) had its origins in a local debate, being Vernon's response to a friend's cordial invitation to read the writings of the dissenter John Owen. With the title-page taking its epigraphs from St Paul and the continental scourge of Independents, the heresiologist Salmasius, Vernon established from the outset a plangent tone. The first half of the pamphlet comprises a fierce attack on Owen's credentials, &#145;dilating upon the perjuries and perfidious as well as seditious practices of your friend&#146;  (p. 40), including his reneging on a succession of oaths, breaking faith with both Oliver and Richard Cromwell and, more predictably, Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, to whom he is alleged to have given a false assurance that he would not keep conventicles. Vernon's immediate grounds for writing are perhaps discovered in a passage elaborating on the reasons for considering Owen a continuing public menace, in which he claims his campaigns to persuade magistrates to relax their vigilance against dissenters had enjoyed some success. In the second half of the pamphlet Vernon denounces those beliefs and practices, supposedly endorsed in Owen's writings, &#145;that manifestly tend to the ruin of Religion and Government&#146;; namely, &#145;if God's providence permits a mischief his will approves it&#146;; that &#145;Saints [that is, dissenters] keep fast their holiness in their sinning&#146;; concluding with a scornful attack on &#145;the modern way of pretending to, and praying, by the Spirit&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>). In a postscript, addressed to Samuel Parker, the author of the controversial defence of Anglican monopoly <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Politie</span> (1670), Vernon championed the legal restrictions on dissenting preachers and teachers, professing firsthand knowledge of their recent seditious assemblies, reporting &#145;You cannot imagine how many of the <i>Country-Coridons</i> &hellip; were preached out of <i>Allegiance</i>&#146;, surmising luridly &#145;nothing was wanting but a <i>Lambert</i> or <i>Ludlow</i>&#146;  (p. 65). The pamphlet concludes with &#145;an Independent Catechism&#146;, a parody of the form chosen by Owen in his celebrated rejoinder to the Socinian Thomas Biddle, which, at its climax, professes regicidal republicanism as an article of faith.<br>
<br>Vernon was answered in <span class="italic">An Expostulatory Letter to the Author of the Late Slanderous Libel Against Dr O[wen]</span> (1671); a collaborative enterprise, its preface written by an anonymous well-wisher and correspondent of the dissenter, the main essay by Owen himself. The preface detected a well-worn strategy behind the <i>ad hominem</i> attack: &#145;by &hellip; wounding, as you think, his Reputation, to render, as you hope, his Excellent and Learned Writings, the less useful to the great Ends of Christianity&#146;  (p. 2). It concluded with a personal rebuke to Vernon &#145;who make your pastime in most Companies where you come, to deride and scoff at your Reverend Diocesan hope, his Excellent and Learned Writings&#146;  (p. 12). Owen dismissed the &#145;whole discourse [as] a railing Accusation&#146;  (p. 16) and criticized Vernon's &#145;malicious wresting and false Applications of the passages he hath quoted&#146;  (p. 19). Shrewdly, Owen roundly denounced his detractor's rehearsal of his conduct during the interregnum as an offence against the king's wishes as published in the <span class="roman">Act of Oblivion</span>.<br>
<br>Vernon's next publication, <span class="italic">Ataxiae obstaculum</span> (1678), was also born of local disputation, &#145;<i>being an answer to certain queries, dispersed in some parts of</i> <i>Gloucestershire</i>&#146;. These had been sent to a local clergyman several years before by Thomas Overbury, nephew to the poet, and a sympathizer with dissenters, whose plight the original paper addressed, seeking to demonstrate &#145;the unreasonableness, especially on Protestant Principles, of exercising Force and Compulsion in Religion&#146;  (Overbury, sig. A2<i>r</i>). The private correspondence apparently remained so until 1676, when Overbury heard of &#145;a weak and unashamed Parson's having taken them into the Pulpit with him&#146;, a provocative act, precipitating a vigorous debate, one consequence of which was that the paper's author found himself &#145;Prosecuted at the Assizes as Criminal&#146;  (ibid., sig. A2<i>r</i>). Vernon's preface is forthright in its endorsement of religious intolerance, declaring his aims to be &#145;first, to remove those false Pretences of Conscience &hellip; the <i>Scape-Goat</i>, to bear all Iniquities&#146; and to come to &#145;the Defence of Magistrate's Power in matters of Religion&#146;  (Vernon, <span class="italic">Ataxiae obstaculum</span>, sig. A5<i>r</i>). Urging unity &#145;against the common Enemy of <i>Protestantism</i>&#146;, Vernon reflected on the number of &#145;<i>Jesuited</i>-Priests&#146; who had escaped prosecution, concluding daringly with a contemptuous allusion to the king's earlier declaration of indulgence, observing that the &#145;vigorous execution of one Law, would do more good than a Million of <i>Proclamations</i>&#146;  (ibid., sigs. A6<i>v</i>, A6<i>r</i>). Vernon conceded that his answer to the queries had little originality, the defence of the established church's intolerance having been justified &#145;ex abundanti&#146; by scholars, but pleaded some merit for his writings in its purpose of informing &#145;the private Christian&#146;  (ibid., sig. A2<i>v</i>). It was perhaps this professed aim that secured the imprimatur of William Jane, bishop of London. Overbury bolstered his reply by drawing on the writings of the Caroline divine William Chillingworth. He invited the reader to examine the caustic tone of Vernon's writing, reflecting &#145;how little he hath complyed with the Gentleman's desire, in returning a Candid and Christian Resolution to them&#146;  (Overbury, sig. C1<i>r</i>). He also recorded his astonishment that &#145;an Impudent Libeller should be Licens'd to reflect thus upon the Government&#146;  (ibid., sig. C3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Vernon's next project was a life of Peter Heylin. In 1681 he was the principal contributor to an unsatisfactory account that appeared prefaced to the Laudian controversialist's collected works. In the following year he published <span class="italic">The Life of the Learned and Reverend Dr Peter Heylyn</span> (1682), justifying its publication by presenting it as his original text before it had been marred by &#145;the indiscretion of some persons, and the forwardness and ostentation of others&#146;  (Vernon, &#145;To the reader&#146;). One remarkable curiosity of its preface was the extraordinary accusation made against one of Heylin's sterner critics, the presbyterian divine Richard Baxter, alleging his participation in a civil war atrocity. Baxter, he claimed, having witnessed a soldier run through with his sword a wounded royalist on the battlefield, took &#145;the King's picture from his Neck; telling him &hellip; That he was a Popish Rogue and that was his Crucifix&#146;  (Vernon, &#145;To the reader&#146;). Vernon further reported that Baxter had recently returned the image, and quoted the affidavit of the alleged victim of the assault.<br>
<br>The controversy that ensued came, however, from an unexpected and embarrassing quarter: a fellow Anglican clergyman John Barnard, Heylin's son-in-law who, in 1683, published <span class="italic">Theologo-historicus, or, The True Life of &hellip; Peter Heylin</span>, in order, the title-page announced, &#145;to correct the Errors, supply the Defects, and confute the Calumnies of a late Writer&#146;. In his compendious preface Barnard revealed the troubled history of Vernon's &#145;lame and imperfect&#146; biography and his eventual unwilling collaboration in the version that had prefaced the 1681 collection at the request of its importunate publisher, by whom he was given <i>carte blanche</i> to make whatever additions he judged fitting  (Barnard, 3). In contrast to his own authorial partitioning of the revised papers, Barnard alleged Vernon's response was &#145;to fall upon them as a Lion rampant&#146;, injudiciously revising contributions until &#145;mangled and metamorphised&#146; beyond recognition and passed off without due acknowledgement as though his own  (ibid., 8, 10). The remainder of the preface comprises a severe critique of Vernon's work, which, with some justice, accuses him of padding out the work with copious extracts from his subject's writings. Barnard was equally censorious of the inclusion of biographical material he considered indecorous, singling out for particular odium Vernon's apologetic account of Heylin's clandestine marriage. According to Anthony Wood, Vernon circulated a manuscript defence, composed with one of the Heylins, which apportioned blame between the printer and Thomas Barlow, bishop of Norwich, in whose possession the manuscript had resided. It remained unpublished and so this unhappy episode brought an end to his literary pretensions.<br>
<br>Vernon served the rest of his days as a parish priest. He died in his rectory in Bourton on the Water on 17 December 1720 and was buried at St Lawrence's Church. The succession of his eldest son, Richard (1674&#150;1752), as rector inaugurated a series of family appointments to the living, which continued up until the eve of the nineteenth century. Richard was succeeded by William Vernon, a pluralist, who held the living until 1780, and &#145;after little more than a year a fourth member of the family, Edward, whose presentation, it was hinted, was simonaical, and whose learning, morals, and previous career were attacked, became rector&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Gloucestershire</span>, 6.46). Vernon is commemorated by a monument on the north wall of the chancel, commissioned by his daughter Dorothy, inscribed to her parents (Vernon's wife was also called Dorothy, but nothing more is known of her) and two brothers, Richard and Charles (1679&#150;1736), rector of St Paul's, Shadwell, in Middlesex.<br>
