<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trocchi,  Alexander Whitelaw Robertson</span>  (1925&#150;1984), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 30 July 1925 at 29 Smith Street, Glasgow, the third son of Alfredo Luigi Trocchi (<i>d</i>. 1963) and Annie Jack Langley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robertson (<i>d</i>. 1942). His father, child of an Italian immigrant, had been a music-hall performer and musician, then turned to managing orchestras and bands. By the time of his youngest son's birth he had partly Anglicized his name to Alfred Louis Trocchi, and mindful of anti-Italian prejudice in Glasgow, his elder sons later dropped his surname in favour of Robertson, their mother's maiden name. Her family were irreproachably middle class. Changing musical tastes and ill health made Alfredo permanently unemployable. The Trocchis moved from the south side to the centre of the city, where Annie ran their premises as a boarding-house. Like his brothers Alexander Trocchi was educated at the very reputable Hillhead primary school and high school, where he did well in his studies and as a sportsman. The school was evacuated to Galloway when the Second World War started, but in January 1942 Alex was called home. His mother had died suddenly, poisoned by a can of pilchards, and was lowered, as he put it, &#145;into a grave that was my destruction&#146;. He was consciously marked by this blow for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Trocchi enrolled at Glasgow University later that year, but in February 1943 was called up for war service. He trained as a Fleet Air Arm pilot, partly in Canada, but for reasons not clear was transferred before qualifying into the Royal Navy as a seaman. He performed well in escort duties on the icy and perilous Arctic convoy route to Murmansk. Before demobilization in November 1946 he was offered a commission, but chose instead to re-enter Glasgow University as a student of English and philosophy.<br>
<br>Two reputations&#151;for brilliance and for deviance&#151;began at university, where Trocchi displayed his capacity to draw people to him with his charm, and then manipulate them. He lived with a veterinary student, Betty Whyte, in a shepherd's cottage 10 miles out of Glasgow, where he attempted for a time to raise pigs. On 15 January 1947 they were secretly married, and their first daughter, Jacqueline, was born exactly a year later. Betty's studies had lapsed, but in 1950 Alex sat his final exams. Due to a miscalculation in his use of benzedrine Alex fell asleep in a philosophy final, but very good marks in English obtained him second-class honours, and his tutors, who had thought him worthy of a first, secured him the Kemsley travelling scholarship. Alex, however, did not want to become an academic. He had for years been experimenting with creative writing, and with wife and daughter he travelled widely in Europe before settling in a suburb of Paris. In 1951 a long poem by Trocchi appeared in the very prestigious Rome-based journal <span class="italic">Botteghe Oscure</span>, and launched him as an &#145;international&#146; writer. A second daughter, Margot, was born in May that year.<br>
<br>In 1952, when Trocchi committed himself to living in Paris, there were thousands of expatriate Americans in the city, many of them aspirant creative writers. Drugs&#151;not only benzedrine, but hashish and cocaine&#151;were part of their culture. Invited by a rich American to edit a new magazine, Trocchi was attracted by Jane Lougee, an American woman with means, from Maine, designated his assistant. He demanded a separation from Betty who eventually, after Trocchi had secured a Mexican divorce in Paris, went to bring up their daughters in New Zealand. In May 1952 the first of eleven issues of <span class="italic">Merlin</span> appeared. Its 1000 copies were peddled by young avant-gardists in Amsterdam, London, and New York as well as Paris. During its brief existence the journal published work by Sartre, Genet, Eluard, Ionesco, Hikmet, Italo Svevo, Robert Creeley, Pablo Neruda, Henry Miller, and Samuel Beckett. Trocchi and his fellow enthusiasts established Collection Merlin to publish books, and it brought out Beckett's first major English-language publication, <span class="italic">Watt</span>.<br>
<br>This publishing enterprise came under the control of Maurice Girodias, who backed it on the understanding that Trocchi's circle would supply texts&#151;&#145;dirty books&#146;&#151;for his Olympia Press, founded in 1953 to take advantage of the absence of censorship in France and to tap the local and international markets for English-language pornography. Trocchi himself supplied seven such texts over three years, five under the pseudonym Frances Lengel: <span class="italic">Helen and Desire</span> (1953); <span class="italic">The Carnal Days of Helen Seferis</span>, <span class="italic">Young Adam</span>, <span class="italic">School for Wives</span> (all 1954); and <span class="italic">White Thighs</span> (1955). In 1954 he contributed <span class="italic">Frank Harris&#151;my Life and Loves: Volume 5</span>, a concocted continuation of an existing &#145;dirty book&#146;, and, in 1955, <span class="italic">Thongs</span>, the &#145;memoirs&#146; of Carmencita de las Lunas. These books later appeared, with variant titles, in many editions, some pirated, and in numerous languages. They should not be regarded as mere hackwork; Trocchi composed blatant pornography with the skills of a remarkable prose stylist. <span class="italic">Thongs</span>, for instance, is detached, parodic, and largely hilarious, and involves sharp implicit satire of the Catholic church. <span class="italic">Young Adam</span> was Trocchi's first &#145;serious novel&#146;, and Trocchi later removed gratuitous sexual episodes on which Girodias had insisted, and published it as his own work. This latter novel was treated respectfully by critics who noted its close relationship with Camus's <span class="italic">L'&eacute;tranger</span>. The unlikeable protagonist, Joe, encountered working on a barge on the Forth and Clyde Canal, is and is not responsible for the death of his lover by drowning. Eroticism pervades the book, connected with what may be called Trocchi's major philosophical preoccupation&#151;for the solipsistic narrator the world should exist &#145;not as a foreign element to be looked at&#146; but as &#145;an extension of myself&#146;. The proprieties of respectable society prevent us breaking into true continuity of self with others, self with world&#151;&#145;the profoundest experiences are in the ordinary situation locked out from one's arena of experience by the inflexible barrier of good character&#146;  (1996 edn, 69, 36).<br>
<br>In August 1954 Jane Lougee went back to America, where she soon afterwards married; Trocchi's already exuberant promiscuity was accentuated. <span class="italic">Merlin</span> folded in 1955, and Trocchi decided to quit Paris. After some time in London, in April 1956, he followed Jane to the United States, where by the autumn he was a &#145;scow captain&#146; with the New York Trap Rock Corporation, on a barge shifting heavy cargoes on the city's waterways, a job which gave him much free time for writing. By now his addiction to heroin was confirmed for life, and the country in which he found himself was unsympathetic to drug addicts. From the sphere of high Parisian literary talk Trocchi had descended into a hell of heavily stigmatized criminality. But it was at a literary party in Greenwich Village that he met a respectable 21-year-old, Marilyn Rose Hicks. He left the scows and they drove to Mexico, where Trocchi divorced Betty for a second time and, on 13 August 1957, married Lyn. They wintered in Venice West, Los Angeles, where the new &#145;beat generation&#146; of writers had one of its epicentres. Trocchi impressed Allen Ginsberg and met Kerouac, Corso, Snyder, and Ken Kesey. They travelled on in April 1958 to Las Vegas, where Lyn made money for heroin through prostitution. Back in New York, their first son, Mark, was born on 2 October.<br>
<br>The following March Trocchi signed a contract with Grove Press for <span class="italic">Cain's Book</span>, which came out in 1961 and is without doubt Trocchi's major achievement. It had been years in the making, as the book itself explains: it is a book about the writing of a book by another protagonist called Joe who is and is not Trocchi himself, working on a scow in New York and digressing back to experiences in Europe, mostly in Glasgow. It displays Trocchi's range, intellectually evoking existentialism, the beats, surrealism, a species of revolutionary socialism, and a Beckett-like ideology. Stylistically it mixes careful, lucid, naturalistic description with philosophizings which are sometimes pretentious and often opaque, and passages of hilarious or eerie fancifulness. Drug addiction is painfully presented. The solipsism of the book's first-person consciousness, shifting between abjectness, anger, and arrogance, is mitigated by the warmth of unsentimental feeling expressed towards Joe's Scottish-Italian parents. In American and British reprints, and in translations into half a dozen languages, it sold a great many copies. Meanwhile in 1959 Trocchi brought out two more pornographic works with Castle Books of New York, a firm as unscrupulous as Olympia, but less distinguished. Payment for these and other writings was not enough to deter Trocchi from sponging off well-to-do American friends whom he had met in Paris, or from sending Lyn out again to sell her body. The US authorities were cracking down harder than ever on heroin use. Trocchi, sometimes held overnight in police cells, was pusher as well as addict. In April 1961 he was charged with supplying the drug to a minor, and faced a possible death penalty. George Plimpton, a young man of distinguished family, put up bail of $5000, and, wearing two of Plimpton's suits which he had stolen, Trocchi escaped over the Canadian border. The singer&#150;songwriter Leonard Cohen took care of him as he waited for a steamer for the UK.<br>
<br>Britain was a calmer world. The country then had comparatively few heroin addicts and there was as yet little public outcry over drug abuse. Trocchi was still an &#145;outsider&#146;, but merely as an unusual kind of writer, radiating alien influences and uttering heterodox views&#151;though by the end of the decade these would be components, almost drearily familiar, of the more extreme wing of sixties &#145;youth culture&#146;. In August 1962 Trocchi clashed at a writers' conference during the Edinburgh Festival with the irascible doyen of Scottish literature, Hugh MacDiarmid, who described him as &#145;Cosmopolitan scum&#146; and as &#145;A writer of no consequence whatever&#146;. The two men shortly made a truce, and the controversy increased Trocchi's fame.<br>
<br>Secure in supplies of legally prescribed heroin, Trocchi fitted into the emergent &#145;sixties&#146; culture of rock music and performance poetry with an ease which perhaps destroyed his talent. Arrogant, paranoid isolation had been his posture. After <span class="italic">Cain's Book</span> appeared in a British edition from Calder Books (Beckett's London publishers), Sheffield magistrates' court pronounced it obscene but the resulting ban had no effect beyond the city boundaries. Again, the publicity was good for Trocchi. In 1966 the mainstream New English Library republished <span class="italic">Young Adam</span> in Trocchi's final version. This and his other books continued to sell well, though because of the shaky nature of his contracts with Girodias and other publishers Trocchi never reaped the full benefits of his international fame. Meanwhile, basing himself in London, where Lyn and his son had joined him, he functioned as a guru of the new avant-garde. Thus he comp&egrave;red an international reading by beat and &#145;underground&#146; poets at the Albert Hall with an audience of several thousand. In his Paris days he had helped to found the Situationist International, a revolutionary groupuscule which operated with explosive&#151;destructive&#151;effect in the student revolt which hit Europe in 1968&#150;9. In 1964 his essay &#145;Invisible insurrection of a million minds&#146; announced the formation of &#145;sigma&#146;, a situationist initiative, &#145;a kind of spontaneous university&#146;, designed to link &#145;thoughtful individuals all over the world&#146; in an assault on capitalist order through such means as privately circulated essays, poetry on toilet rolls, sale of artworks cutting out the middleman, and &#145;happenings&#146;&#151;bizarre events. A number of significant writers and artists took sigma seriously. Such were the times. Trocchi was fashionable. Dabbling in art now, he was asked to lecture in the sculpture department of the distinguished St Martin's School of Art. The Arts Council gave him a writer's grant of &pound;500 in 1970, though <span class="italic">The Long Book</span> which Calder had announced for publication in 1966&#151;perhaps, in fact, merely a collection of occasional writings&#151;was never finished. An unsuccessful collection of poems, mostly written in the fifties, <span class="italic">Man at Leisure</span> (1972), was to be Trocchi's last book.<br>
<br>Lyn had produced a second son, Nicolas, in December 1966. She was worse hit by her addiction than Trocchi, and in November 1972 she died, aged thirty-five, of chronic hepatitis with complications. In May 1977 their promising son Mark died of cancer of the throat. A young New Zealand woman, Sally Child, moved in to console Trocchi. He had lived since the mid-sixties in a penthouse flat in Observatory Gardens, a desirable address in Kensington. Income came from various sources&#151;translations from the French, film rights (a film of <span class="italic">Cain's Book</span> with major stars came tantalizingly close to realization), and profitable second-hand book stalls. The &#145;monster&#146; demonized by the press (his pornographic books were still subject to well-publicized seizures and bans) was at last a melancholy, soft-spoken, middle-aged gentleman, to be seen acquiring rare books at Sothebys sales. On 15 April 1984, some time after an operation for lung cancer, Trocchi died at his home of lobal pneumonia. He was cremated at Mortlake crematorium, London, on 25 April. In December of that year fire mysteriously swept through his flat. His son Nicolas shortly afterwards committed suicide by jumping off its roof.<br>
<br>To declare that Trocchi had been unjustly forgotten became at once a favourite posture of those admirers who preferred to think of the man as rejected, misunderstood and, as a result, their private property. In his last twenty-three years he had published no new fiction. Andrew Murray Scott's biography, published in 1991, showed the continuity of academic interest in him in his native Scotland. The biography antedated by two years the wave of Scottish fiction about a new youth &#145;drug scene&#146; which was launched by Irvine Welsh's immensely successful <span class="italic">Trainspotting</span> (1993). This provoked further reprints of Trocchi, but, as Welsh's partly dismissive comments about him suggest, the drug scene of the 1950s and 1960s in Britain, when there were few addicts, was very different from that of the 1980s and 1990s, when drugs became a problem affecting a much greater number of people, and engrossing a larger proportion of police time. Trocchi, with his relentless intellectualism and his generally fastidious, often &#145;poetic&#146; prose, might well strike Welsh as an interesting middle-class antique. And yet, with the publication of <span class="italic">Cain's Book</span>, Trocchi was established as one of the main Scottish writers of the twentieth century.<br>
