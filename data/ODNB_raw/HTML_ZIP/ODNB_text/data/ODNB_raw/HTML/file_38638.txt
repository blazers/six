<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Elmy,  Elizabeth Clarke  Wolstenholme</span>  (1833&#150;1918), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born on 30 November 1833, in the Manchester area, daughter of Joseph Wolstenholme, a Methodist minister, and his first wife, Elizabeth Clarke, the daughter of a cotton spinner; Elizabeth died shortly after her daughter's birth. Doubly orphaned by the age of fourteen, Elizabeth Wolstenholme then enjoyed her only two years of formal education, at the Moravian School, Fulneck, near Leeds. After a period of further self-education, she took over a private girls' school at Boothstown, near Worsley, of which she became headmistress. Her philosophy of education was set out in her contribution to Josephine Butler's collection of essays <span class="italic">Woman's Work and Woman's Culture</span> (1869). It was an enlightened one for its time, especially in emphasizing the need to prepare girls for economic independence.<br>
<br>In 1865 Elizabeth Wolstenholme joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92488', "Kensington Society")</script> as a corresponding member. This women's debating group had grown out of the Langham Place circle, a socially disparate group of women's rights advocates that had gathered around the Unitarian radicals Barbara Leigh Smith and Bessie Rayner Parkes in the late 1850s. Reform of the laws governing marriage, improved educational provision for girls, and an expansion of economic opportunities for women were among the chief concerns of this circle.<br>
<br>So began a lifetime career campaigning for women's rights. Sylvia Pankhurst recalled Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy in her later years as a &#145;tiny Jenny-wren of a woman, with bright, bird-like eyes, and a little face, child-like in its merriment and its pathos, which even in extreme old age retained the winning graces of youth&#146;  (Pankhurst, 31). Another suffragist colleague, Dora Montefiore, claimed: &#145;The work of Mrs Elmy has never been sufficiently recognised, because she was frowned upon by the official suffragists, though she had quite the most able mind and memory of any nineteenth-century woman&#146;  (Montefiore, 113). More conventional colleagues were alienated by Elizabeth Wolstenholme's ultra-radical views, notably on marriage. She expected from others, especially the well-to-do, the same unstinting dedication that she herself gave to the women's movement. She was always antagonistic to party-political loyalties where these impinged on campaigns for women's rights. There was, too, a certain prickliness, springing largely from her relative poverty and consequent dependence on positions financed by other, more wealthy, leaders of the movement. Altogether, those more cautious, pragmatic, and conformist, or less generous-spirited and courageous than herself, sometimes found her a difficult colleague with whom to work.<br>
<br>For the larger part of her career Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy concentrated her efforts on behalf of women's rights in her own region. In the early 1860s, for example, she established the Manchester Board of Schoolmistresses to advance educational provision for women and provide collegial support among women teachers. She was also active in the North of England Council for the Promotion of the Education of Women, which grew out of this and similar bodies. She was among those who successfully pressed for the establishment of the Cambridge higher examinations for women, and for the programme of advanced lectures for women that eventually led to the foundation of Newnham College, Cambridge. In 1866 she gave evidence concerning existing provision for female education to the schools inquiry commission, among the first four women whose opinion was sought by a royal commission.<br>
<br>In the mid-1860s advanced women's rights activists also began to pursue the enfranchisement of women. A new <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> was anticipated, and John Stuart Mill offered support for women's suffrage during his successful election campaign for the seat of Westminster in 1865. Her attendance at one of his election meetings was among Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy's fondest memories in old age. Once elected, Mill undertook to pursue the question of women's suffrage in parliament, on the condition that a petition was raised in support of this demand. To this end, Elizabeth Wolstenholme established a women's suffrage committee in Manchester with the support of local radical Liberals, including Ursula and Jacob Bright and a young lawyer, Richard Pankhurst. Similar committees were established in London and in major provincial centres, leading within a few years to the formation of a permanent national network of women's suffrage societies.<br>
<br>In 1867 Elizabeth Wolstenholme moved out of Manchester and established a new school at Moody Hall, Congleton, in Cheshire. She also relinquished the honorary secretaryship of the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage to Lydia Becker, whom she had recruited to its founding committee. Now she pursued a number of other reforms that reflected her radical approach to women's emancipation. The first of these reforms was pursued by the Married Women's Property Committee (MWPC), of which she became honorary secretary after it was formed in Manchester in 1867, a cause closely linked to that of women's suffrage. Eligibility for the parliamentary franchise still rested on the ownership of property of a certain value or above. Most married women were deprived of the ability to hold property by the common law doctrine of coverture, which subsumed their legal personality under that of their husbands. Hence married women were effectively, though not expressly, excluded from any formulation of the suffrage demand in terms of sexual equality. The goal of the MWPC was to enable married women to retain their property and put an end to coverture, thus also advancing the eligibility of married women to the vote once equal rights were secured. It met with only limited success in the passage of the <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Act</span> of 1870. Married women's rights over property, especially in the form of earnings, were extended, but the bill had been so comprehensively amended as it went through parliament as to leave intact the doctrine of coverture.<br>
<br>At the conference of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science in Bristol in 1869 Elizabeth Wolstenholme first learnt of the passage, over the previous few years, of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>. This legislation aimed to control the extent of venereal disease among the armed forces. It provided for the enforced medical supervision of all women deemed prostitutes by the police in designated military and naval towns. Those women who refused to comply with the acts might receive a prison sentence with hard labour. Elizabeth Wolstenholme contacted her old friend Josephine Butler, a matron of impeccable reputation and some standing in philanthropic work among prostitutes, and urged on her the need to resist the continuance of such legislation. The formation of the Ladies National Association for Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts followed consultation with others of the more intrepid among women's rights activists. Its campaigns resulted in the suspension of these acts in 1884, and their repeal in 1886.<br>
<br>In 1871 Elizabeth Wolstenholme joined with Josephine Butler and other reformers in forming the Committee for Amending the Law in Points Injurious to Women. Its goals were more extensive than either women's suffrage or married women's property rights, and encompassed any aspect of legislation that treated women unequally with men. The same concerns and leadership were evident in the subsequent formation of the Vigilance Association for the Defence of Personal Rights. In 1872 Elizabeth Wolstenholme gave up her school and moved to London to become the paid secretary of this new organization, an appointment that recognized her now extensive knowledge of parliamentary procedure and her skills as a lobbyist.<br>
<br>By the mid-1870s Elizabeth Wolstenholme, like other radical Liberals, was increasingly at odds with the leadership of the suffrage movement, in which Lydia Becker had moved to the fore. In the changed parliamentary context that followed the election of a Conservative government, Lydia Becker and other pragmatists, such as Millicent Garrett Fawcett, were prepared to narrow the programme of the women's movement. They advocated limiting the suffrage demand to single and widowed women, and sought the suspension of the campaign for still further reform of the <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Acts</span>. Most of the radicals in the northern leadership of the women's movement rejected such a restriction of their original goals.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Wolstenholme's private life now became a matter for further discord. Some years earlier she had joined the secularist movement. Freethinkers found much to criticize in the existing institution of marriage, and Elizabeth Wolstenholme was by now well-versed in the legal disabilities of married women. So, with some deliberation, she entered a free union with one of her former neighbours in Congleton, Ben Elmy (1838&#150;1906), a teacher turned silk crape manufacturer and sometime vice-president of the National Secular Society. Though there appears to have been some kind of informal wedding ceremony, probably early in 1874, theirs was a marriage not recognized under English law. When, some months later, Elizabeth Wolstenholme's pregnancy became evident the couple were urged, in the interests of the women's movement, to formalize their union. They did so on 12 October 1874, a few months before the birth of their son.<br>
<br>When Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy sought to return to public life in the autumn of 1875, she met with opposition from some among the leadership of the women's movement, notably Lydia Becker and Millicent Garrett Fawcett. With the support of Josephine Butler and Ursula Bright she resisted exclusion from the offices to which she sought reappointment, but with only limited success. She did not return to the secretaryship of the Vigilance Association, but her work for the Married Women's Property Committee, of which her wealthy friend Ursula Bright was treasurer, appears to have continued anonymously prior to her gradual reacceptance into public life in the early 1880s. The eventual passage of the 1882 <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Act</span> has often been credited almost entirely to the campaigning of these two women. Once again, however, the original bill was so amended as to leave the doctrine of coverture in place. But it so extended the capacity of married women to hold property that in the years that followed they became increasingly eligible for local government franchises and offices.<br>
<br>For the next two decades Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy concentrated on securing civil equality for wives. Her views are set out in numerous contributions to the <span class="italic">Personal Rights Journal</span> in the 1880s and the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> in the 1890s (where she wrote under her pseudonym, Ignota). She is said virtually single-handedly to have secured the passage of the 1886 <span class="roman">Infant Custody Act</span>, whereby women's custodial rights over their children were extended. Thereafter, she returned to the campaign for women's suffrage, but concentrated on defending and advancing the claims of married women to inclusion in the demand, a question that had by this stage split the national leadership. To such ends she helped form two successive splinter organizations, again largely with the support of northern radicals such as Richard and Emmeline Pankhurst.<br>
<br>The Women's Franchise League was formed in 1889, with Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy appointed its paid secretary. The league promoted a formulation of the suffrage demand that included married women, alongside reform of the divorce and other laws that left women unequal rights in marriage. Within a year, however, internal tensions led Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy to resign her post. In 1892 she formed the Women's Emancipation Union (WEU). The programme of this body was similar to that of the league, but put particular emphasis on the injustices arising from coverture, including the legality of marital rape. It also promoted the greater participation of women in local government, an area where women were receiving steadily growing voting rights and expanding eligibility for office. Some of Ben Elmy's writings on sex education, under the pseudonym Ellis Ethelmer, were also published under its auspices.<br>
<br>The enfranchisement of married women under the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span> of 1894 eased the way for the reunification of the suffrage movement. The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) was formed in 1897, under the leadership of Millicent Garrett Fawcett, out of the largest of the pre-existing suffrage societies. The league and the WEU were gradually wound down in the years that followed.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy was never at ease with the national leadership of the suffrage movement, however, after the bitter controversy that had surrounded her marriage. She remained, also, a northern radical, suspicious of metropolitan ways and influences. For the next few years, she worked most closely with the North of England Society of the NUWSS, becoming an enthusiastic supporter of the campaign it waged, at the turn of the century, among the women textile workers of the region. She was also among the earliest supporters of the new &#145;militant&#146; society formed by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst in 1903, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), eventually joining its national committee. She soon also joined the Independent Labour Party, with which the WSPU still had close links and which published her pamphlet <span class="italic">Women's Franchise: the Need of the Hour</span> (1907). In her seventy-fifth year she walked at the head of the main procession to Hyde Park, where one of the WSPU's most impressive popular demonstrations was staged in 1908. By now, though, she found regular travel between London and her home increasingly taxing, and gradually her public life became largely limited to letters to the press.<br>
<br>The financial plight of Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy was a cause for increasing concern among her friends in the 1890s, after the failure of Ben Elmy's silk mill. A &#145;grateful fund&#146; was established to acknowledge her services to women, and provided her with a small annuity in the years that followed. She died at 231 Upper Brook Street, Chorlton upon Medlock, on 12 March 1918, shortly after the enactment of women's suffrage, but before she herself could cast a parliamentary vote.<br>
