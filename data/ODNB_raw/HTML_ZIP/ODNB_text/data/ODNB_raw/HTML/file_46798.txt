<span class="headword">Butler, Sir  William Waters</span>, first baronet  (1866&#150;1939), <span class="occ">brewer</span>, was born on 14 December 1866 in his father's newly acquired public house, the London Works tavern, in Smethwick, near Birmingham. He was the eldest son of William Butler, a publican and brewer, and his wife, Mary Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ewing. His rise from these comparatively modest beginnings was assisted by his father's success as a full-scale commercial brewer, following a move in 1876 to The Crown, 36/7 Broad Street, Birmingham, and the purchase of several public houses. He was educated at the city's King Edward VI School and at the Birmingham and Midland Institute, where he qualified as a chemist. He then joined the family brewery and was head brewer and partner by the age of twenty-one. In 1893 he married Emily Mary, daughter of John Brown of Smethwick. They had a son, William Owen Butler, captain in the Royal Warwickshire regiment, who died in 1935, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Butler encouraged an expansionist business strategy which culminated in an agreed merger with Henry Mitchell &amp; Co. of Cape Hill, Smethwick, to form Mitchells and Butlers in 1898. Butler immediately joined the board, became deputy chairman in 1907, and was chairman and managing director from 1914 until his death in 1939. Sound and conservative management kept the company free of the excesses of the property mania of the 1890s and 1900s. Mitchells and Butlers had an impressive growth and profit record, its ordinary dividends averaging 13.6 per cent, excluding bonuses, in 1914&#150;39. The labour force increased from under 300 in 1898 to over 1500 by 1930.<br>
<br>Butler's company distinguished itself by its emphasis on &#145;fewer and better&#146; public houses, a rationalization strategy in which large outlets, run on efficient lines by managers instead of tenants, were designed to replace several smaller premises. In 1897 Butler was prominent in a consortium of Birmingham brewers which was formed to administer a voluntary &#145;surrender scheme&#146;. The Birmingham Property Company was established to administer a fund to compensate brewers who agreed to surrender licences on run-down pubs affected by slum clearance schemes. This acted as a model for a national statutory compensation scheme, which was introduced in 1904. Butler and his colleagues went further than merely reducing the number of pubs. They established an informal quid pro quo arrangement with the local licensing magistrates, by which licences were given up in return for new licences on a smaller number of larger, newly built pubs. Mitchells and Butlers, which had given up about three hundred licences by 1925, led the way in Birmingham in building fine new pubs, architecturally impressive, with a whole series of amenities, including gardens, meeting rooms, bowling greens, family rooms, and restaurants. The strategy, which was taken up by brewers and licensing magistrates all over England, did much to divert the hostility of temperance lobbying and to present a more respectable and responsible image of brewing.<br>
<br>Butler was also prominent nationally in the brewing industry. In 1901, as a delegate of the Birmingham and Midland Counties Brewers' Association, he attended his first meeting of the Country Brewers' Society (from 1904 the Brewers' Society), the trade association representing English brewers, and was elected president of the Institute of Brewing in 1906. He acted as chairman of the Brewers' Society in 1907&#150;8, at a critical period for the industry, which was under attack from the temperance and teetotaller interests in the Liberal government. Butler led the defence against the hostile and wide-ranging licensing bill of 1908, which was eventually defeated in the Lords. The First World War increased the pressure on the brewers, adding output and trading restrictions to the general climate of hostility fostered by Lloyd George. Butler was prominent in deflecting opposition. He agreed to serve as a member of the central control board (liquor traffic), a body constituted in 1915 to regulate the trade in wartime, and, more specifically, to manage the state-owned assets of those breweries nationalized in munitions areas. He threw himself into the task with characteristic enthusiasm, helping to transform the Carlisle State Brewery and its tied estate, applying the same &#145;fewer and better&#146; principles which had served him well in Birmingham. Then, he was prominent with Sir George Younger and Colonel John Gretton in presenting the brewers' response to government proposals to nationalize the whole of the drinks trade. Butler's surprising but disarming reaction&#151;he declared himself happy to accept state purchase provided the compensation terms were adequate&#151;did much to expose the inadequacies of Lloyd George's assault on the industry. Butler was perceived to be one of brewing's staunchest and most able champions.<br>
<br>Butler's other business interests included chairmanship of Birmingham Cold Storage Ltd, but he was also known for his contribution to higher education and training in brewing. In Birmingham, he did much to encourage the fledgeling university, which gained its charter in 1900. His generous benefactions helped to establish the university's school of brewing and malting in 1900, an endowed chair (the Adrian Brown professorship of brewing), and the new biology block of 1927 (Butler personally contributing &pound;50,000). In 1938 he established the Brewers' Society brewing scholarships at the Birmingham Brewing School. He became a member of the council of Birmingham University in 1917, and was also a life governor. Hospitals and a miscellany of charities also benefited from his generosity.<br>
<br>Butler was a genial, kindly man; he loved orchids, and not only attended business meetings with one in his buttonhole, but frequently took prize blooms to distribute at public functions. His many friends included the Birmingham family of Joseph Chamberlain. A baronetcy was conferred on him, in recognition of his philanthropic, national, and political services, in 1926. Butler died suddenly on 5 April 1939, at his home, Southfield, Norfolk Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, aged seventy-two. He left &pound;552,615 gross and was survived by his wife.<br>
