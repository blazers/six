<span class="headword">Douglass, Sir  James Nicholas</span>  (1826&#150;1898), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, eldest son of Nicholas Douglass of Northumberland, and his wife, Alice, daughter of James Douglass of Winlaton, co. Durham, was born on 16 October 1826 at Bow, London, where his father was employed by the engineering firm of Hunter and English. He was educated at Blaydon, co. Durham, on the Tyne, and at Bridgend under the Revd E. Jones, and was then apprenticed to Hunter and English at Bow. His father, meanwhile, having ventured his own capital on an engineering and shipbuilding business on the Thames which failed, joined the engineering staff of Trinity House in 1839 and rose to be superintending engineer.<br>
<br>In 1847 Douglass became assistant to his father in the erection of the Bishop's Rock lighthouse in the Isles of Scilly. He then became manager at R. J. and R. Laycock's railway carriage works on the Tyne. He returned briefly to Scilly in 1854 to marry Mary, second daughter of Captain James Tregarthen, shipowner of St Mary's. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1855 he was appointed resident engineer of the Gun Fleet Pile lighthouse, and afterwards of the Smalls Rock lighthouse near Milford Haven. This latter work was one of extraordinary difficulty and danger. Douglass always accompanied the working party, and was the first to land and the last to leave. He had many narrow escapes; during the terrible gale of October 1859, when the passenger steamer <i>Royal Charter</i> was wrecked, it was thought that the whole of the working party had been drowned, but the small sailing tender in which the party embarked from the rock succeeded at length in making Swansea harbour.<br>
<br>In 1861 Douglass became resident engineer on the Wolf Rock lighthouse, situated in deep water between Land's End and the Isles of Scilly. The structure was not completed until 1870, and the dangerous nature of the work was made plain in Douglass's account to the Institution of Civil Engineers. In October 1862 he was appointed chief engineer to the corporation of Trinity House in succession to James Walker. Foremost among the many important lighthouses which he designed was his replacement of John Smeaton's famous Eddystone lighthouse, necessitated by the disintegration of the rock upon which it stood. Douglass found a new site, and took down most of the old lighthouse, which was re-erected on Plymouth Hoe, itself a difficult task. Work was begun on 17 July 1878, and the new lighthouse was opened on 18 May 1882, the cost (below the original estimate) being &pound;59,250. On the completion of this work he was knighted in June 1882.<br>
<br>Douglass carried out, in conjunction with John Tyndall and Michael Faraday, many exhaustive experiments with fog signals and on lighthouse illumination by Argand oil lamps and by electric arc lamps. In 1884 he was a member of the committee appointed by Trinity House to assess the effectiveness of different kinds of light for lighthouse work. The committee made its experiments at the North Foreland, reporting that oil was the most economical and suitable illuminant for ordinary lighthouses, but that electric lighting was preferable for the more important structures on lofty headlands.<br>
<br>Douglass became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 5 February 1861, and was elected to the council in 1881. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1887, and in 1886, at the Birmingham meeting of the British Association, he served as president of the mechanical section. He attended the Montreal meeting of the association in 1884, preceding it by travelling with his wife and daughter across Canada to the Rocky Mountains and back by train, a tour which, with the meeting, lasted some three months. He was a governor of Dulwich College and of University College, London, and retained his position with Trinity House until an attack of paralysis in 1892 obliged him to resign. He spent his last years at Stella, Bonchurch, on the Isle of Wight, where he died on 19 June 1898. He was buried at Bonchurch.<br>
