<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Prout,  Samuel</span>  (1783&#150;1852), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born on 17 September 1783 at Trevil Street, Plymouth, Devon, the fourth of the fourteen children of Samuel Prout (1747&#150;1823), a shopkeeper and naval outfitter, and his wife, Mary Cater. He was baptized at the Old Tabernacle in Plymouth but by 1810 had joined the Church of England, and he is recorded as a devout attender at St Mary's, Hastings, in the 1840s. Prout was educated at Plymouth grammar school, where he and the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon were encouraged to sketch by the headmaster, Dr Bidlake. He had some drawing lessons at this time from T. H. Williams, who anticipated an early speciality of west country cottage and village scenes. Thereafter he received no formal artistic training.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareermarriageandfriendships"></a>Early career, marriage, and friendships</h2>In 1802 Prout moved to London, where he learned his trade in the circle of the antiquarian publisher John Britton. As one of Britton's team of illustrators, Prout contributed to the first volume of <span class="italic">Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain</span> (4 vols., 1807&#150;18). He formed his earliest drawing and tinted-wash style in the ambience of his fellow illustrators J. C. Smith, Frederick Nash, T. R. Underwood, Frederick Mackenzie, and George Shepherd. Britton stated that, from about 1803, he also employed Prout to copy sketches by Thomas Hearne, William Alexander, J. M. W. Turner, J. S. Cotman, and Mackenzie. Prout was particularly indebted to Hearne and never abandoned the picturesque, antiquarian tradition. His characteristic, mature, broken-line drawing technique can be traced back through Thomas Girtin and Joseph Farington to Canaletto. Henry Edridge was a later influence, and around 1820 Prout's drawings are sometimes indistinguishable from those of Edridge.<br>
<br>Prout married Elizabeth Gillespie (1788&#150;1863) in Brixton, London, on 27 December 1810; they had four children, born between 1813 and 1822. From 1811 to 1835 the Prouts lived in Brixton, though their last years in London were spent at 5 De Crespigny Terrace, Camberwell. Ill health twice drove Prout from the city, first back to Plymouth from 1805 to 1808 and then to Hastings between 1836 and 1844. He suffered from disabling headaches and from congestion of the lungs throughout his life; the headaches have been linked to an attack of sunstroke in childhood.<br>
<br>Among Prout's west country artist friends were Haydon, John Jackson&#151;who depicted Prout at his most confident in an oil portrait of 1823 (NPG)&#151;Francis Chantrey, Charles Eastlake (a pupil), and William Brockedon&#151;whose 1826 portrait drawing (NPG) suggests a more brittle personality. At least from 1828 to 1833 Prout regularly attended the Artists' Conversazione, an evening social gathering in London to which young artists brought recent work. There he met friends such as Clarkson Stanfield, David Roberts, Cotman (who exhibited some of Prout's watercolours at the Norwich Society of Artists in 1831), David Cox, and T. S. Boys. R. P. Bonington and Prout sketched together at St Omer in northern France about 1822, as recorded by an oil painting by Bonington (Nottingham Castle Museum) and two fine drawings of the ruined abbey church by Prout (V&amp;A). Prout's connections with the Paris art world were with the dealers John Arrowsmith, Claude Schroth, and Baron Taylor, through whom he showed watercolours of Augsburg, Cologne, and Utrecht at the Salon of 1824. He also contributed some lithograph views to the third volume (1825) of Nodier and Taylor's <span class="italic">Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l'ancienne France</span>.<br>
<br>Among Prout's London friends were art collectors such as John Allnutt and Francis Broderip and aristocratic patrons such as the dukes of Bedford and Newcastle and the marquess of Stafford, to whose families he gave drawing lessons at a guinea a time. From 1809 to 1821 Prout also taught at Dr Glennie's school, Dulwich Grove; two of his pupils, the Revd J. D. Glennie and W. H. Harriott, later became amateur artists and travel writers. J. D. Harding, the only artist with whom Prout had a serious professional disagreement, is said to have been a private pupil about 1811.<h2>
<a name="Proutandtheprinttrade"></a>Prout and the print trade</h2>For most of his career a significant proportion of Prout's income came from the print trade; among his publisher friends were Rudolph Ackermann&#151;whose son Richard travelled with him in Germany in 1821&#151;George Cooke, E. W. Cooke, and Charles Turner. Prout's account book for 1811&#150;16 (North Devon Athenaeum, Barnstaple) lists more than 1330 watercolours and sepia wash drawings bought for a total of &pound;800 by Thomas Palser (his first important client after John Britton) and Rudolph Ackermann. Prout was a prominent author of &#145;teach yourself&#146; watercolour painting books. <span class="italic">Rudiments of Landscape in Progressive Studies</span> (1813) demonstrated how to draw and to add sepia wash, lessons illustrated through soft-ground etching and aquatint; the colour for the final lessons in <span class="italic">A Series of Easy Lessons in Landscape Drawing</span> (1820) was added by hand. Later art manuals such as <span class="italic">Hints on Light and Shadow, Composition etc.</span> (1836) and <span class="italic">Prout's Microcosm: the Artist's Sketchbook</span> (1841) were illustrated in the new technique of lithography, of which Prout was a pioneer. His first lithograph was published by Ackermann in 1817, and he contributed to Alois Senefelder's <span class="italic">A Complete Course of Lithography</span> in 1819. He used this technique for a volume of sixteen <span class="italic">Marine Sketches</span> (1820) and for the first of his next and celebrated speciality, the old towns of Europe, <span class="italic">Picturesque Buildings in Normandy</span> (1821), printed by Charles Hullmandel. He made his first foreign tour, to Normandy, in 1819, following in the footsteps of Edridge and Cotman and, by a small margin, was the first to publish his Normandy views in print form and the first to make a substantial show of them, exhibiting ten such subjects at the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1821. In the same fashion Prout can be said to have explored the old towns of France (Loire), the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (Rhineland, Saxony, Bavaria, Bohemia), and Italy, all of which he toured between 1819 and 1829. From these visits came often repeated views of Rouen, Tours, Ghent, Strasbourg, Cologne, Nuremberg, Dresden, and Verona, to name but a few.<br>
<br>Prout's finest work in lithograph, <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Rhine</span> (1822&#150;6), displaying wide and spacious river landscapes, was untypical and was followed by more restricted and characteristic urban &#145;close-ups&#146; in his nevertheless splendid <span class="italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</span> (fifty plates, 1833), executed in tinted (two-toned) lithograph. This ambitious book was published independently by subscription and from it Prout made some &pound;2000 over three years. <span class="italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in France, Switzerland and Italy</span> (twenty-six tinted lithographs) was published by Hodson and Graves in 1839 in the usual way.<br>
<br>Among Prout's most impressive early landscapes of panoramic coastal and cottage scenes were the <span class="italic">Picturesque Delineations in the Counties of Devon and Cornwall</span>, published by Palser in 1812. The breadth and freedom of these etchings was matched only by the <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Rhine</span>. Both are a far cry from the small-scale copper- or steel-engravings after Prout that appeared in Britton's antiquarian publications such as the <span class="italic">Beauties of England and Wales</span> (1803&#150;15) or later in the new, popular travel books and annuals. The <span class="italic">Landscape Annual</span>, for which Prout provided all the illustrations in 1830 and 1831 following a tour to the Alps and Italy in 1824, was printed in large numbers and reached a very wide audience.<h2>
<a name="ProutandRuskin"></a>Prout and Ruskin</h2>The sight of <span class="italic">Flanders and Germany</span> prompted John Ruskin's father to make a tour of the Rhine in 1833 and to buy a watercolour of Lisieux, Normandy, in 1834. Ruskin's critical championing of Prout began in the 1846 edition of <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span>, where he wrote: &#145;There is <i>no</i> stone drawing, <i>no</i> vitality of architecture like Prout's&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Ruskin</span>, 3.217). Ruskin wrote an appreciation of Prout for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1849 and further praised the artist in <span class="italic">The Stones of Venice</span> in 1851&#150;3, in which he coined the term &#145;Proutism&#146;. In 1879 he arranged an exhibition of Prout's drawings, alongside those of their mutual friend W. H. Hunt, &#145;to illustrate the outgoing course of an old-fashioned Continental tour, beginning at Calais, and ending at Rome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Notes by Mr. Ruskin</span>, 39). These <span class="italic">Notes</span> contain Ruskin's most detailed analysis of Prout as a draughtsman, and the autotype illustrations to the catalogue, mostly of drawings made on site on tour, demonstrate not only his broken line but also a vigorous use of the lead pencil, with tone added with the finger or stump (an implement for spreading pencil or chalk) and touches of white highlights, both emphasizing lights and shadows, a subject much dwelt on in his drawing manuals.<br>
<br>Ruskin was less admiring of Prout's watercolours, which he criticized for occasional patches of strong or hot colour, probably executed with non-transparent gouache or bodycolour, creating an imbalance often exaggerated by the fading of the more transparent pigments. Prout never took on the more fluid and highly charged style developed by Cotman and the younger generation of Harding, Boys, and William Callow, and his use of warmer colouring was never fully absorbed into his otherwise picturesque manner. His general method, unchanged from his early maturity, was to establish a warm, brown tone in the foreground set off against the blue and white of naturalistic skies. Prout's characteristic drawing with the reed pen, which he used to emphasize structure in finished watercolours, also remained as a survival of the antiquarian picturesque and was regarded by some critics, other than Ruskin, as mannered.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>Prout's contemporary reputation was at its height by 1830. His first major notice, in the <span class="italic">Magazine of the Fine Arts</span> in 1821, featured a seascape (25&frac12; in. &times; 38&frac12; in.), <span class="italic">A Man-of-War Ashore</span>, similar perhaps to a smaller watercolour now in the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester. This was the first major subject in watercolour that Prout developed after his cottage scenes. Large trading ships or naval relics in harbour or on the beach also go back to his west country origins. For his most characteristic subject, the old towns and streets of Europe, Prout broke new and foreign ground which first gained critical notice in 1824:<blockquote>There are some views of towns, and some river scenes, of large dimensions, by Mr Prout, which, for pictorial character, originality of effect, depth of tone, and general energy of style, excel all his former works, and may be regarded as wonders in water-colours. (E. Hardcastle [W. H. Pyne], <span class="italic">Somerset House Gazette</span>, 2, 1824, 477&#150;8)</blockquote>Prout was appointed &#145;Painter in Water-Colours in Ordinary to His Majesty&#146; in 1829, an honour renewed by William IV and Queen Victoria. In 1830 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was then among the top half-dozen watercolour painters exhibiting in London, and known to a wider public as an illustrator of drawing manuals and travel books.<br>
<br>After 1830 ill health prevented Prout from making more than the occasional foreign or home tour, and his subject matter therefore became highly repetitious. <span class="italic">Porch of Ratisbon Cathedral</span>, for example, was exhibited at the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1824, 1826, 1828, 1844, and 1849, and perhaps more often, since a fine version of the same view (V&amp;A) was listed in 1832 as <span class="italic">At Ratisbonne</span>. Sometimes a watercolour is based so loosely upon the original site-drawing as to be a capriccio or imaginary landscape and can be regarded as a response to Prout's inability to add to his stock. Friends and rivals such as Roberts out-travelled him, visiting destinations such as Spain and the Holy Land, and the novelty of Prout's subject matter faded. He lost the commission in 1832 for a third Italian volume of the <span class="italic">Landscape Annual</span> to Harding.<br>
<br>The focus of Prout's professional activity from 1815 to 1851 was the annual exhibition of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. Prices for his leading exhibits there rose from &pound;42 for <span class="italic">Malines, Flanders</span> and <span class="italic">Louvain</span> in 1823 to &pound;52. 10<i>s</i>. for <span class="italic">Indiaman Dismasted</span> and <span class="italic">Munich</span> in 1824, to a maximum &pound;63 for <span class="italic">Ponte di Rialto, Venice</span> in 1827. Half of Prout's most expensive exhibits from the 1820s to the 1840s featured Venice. However, his income fell from a high point in 1833&#150;4 as he became more dependent on dealers and publishers, and by the end of his career he was selling much of his work to dealers outside London, such as John Hewett in Leamington and J. C. Grundy in Manchester.<h2>
<a name="Deathandposthumousreputation"></a>Death and posthumous reputation</h2>Prout died at his home in Camberwell, London, on 10 February 1852 from an apoplectic fit, after a birthday party given for John Ruskin by his parents, neighbours in Denmark Hill. He was buried in Norwood cemetery. His widow and family moved to Ilfracombe, Devon. Later that year a sale of his drawings at Sotheby and Wilkinson raised &pound;1788. The contents of his studio and drawings that failed to sell later, in 1880 at Christies, were given after the death of Prout's only son and last surviving child to the North Devon Athenaeum, Barnstaple. Samuel Gillespie Prout (1822&#150;1911) painted in his father's manner but by the 1870s was occupied primarily as a popular religious writer and philanthropist at home and abroad. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22843/', "John Skinner Prout (1806&#150;1876)")</script>, Samuel's nephew, a professional watercolour painter, like many other amateur and professional artists of the time, was also influenced by his uncle's style.<br>
<br>Ruskin's critical support raised Prout's posthumous reputation to a peak by the 1880s, and it is symptomatic that twenty-one of Prout's watercolours were included in the Manchester Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887. Thereafter Prout's reputation as a watercolour painter declined, and it reached a low point in the mid-twentieth century. A partial recovery, based upon greater recognition of his importance in introducing the subject of the European picturesque, took place in the last quarter of that century. The qualities of Prout's best work in watercolour remain obscured by his numerous repetitions of subject and by the large body of work by imitators or contemporaries influenced by his style. He has not yet been recognized as the principal English promoter of lithography as a reproductive method for landscapes in the 1820s, although notice has increasingly been given to his etchings, lithographs, and drawings. His watercolours are well represented in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the City Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham, and the City Art Gallery and Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester. Sketchbooks by Prout are in the National Maritime Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the North Devon Athenaeum, Barnstaple, and the Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio.<br>
