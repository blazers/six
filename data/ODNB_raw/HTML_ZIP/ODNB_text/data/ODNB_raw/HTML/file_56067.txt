<span class="headword">Trelawny, Sir  John Salusbury  Salusbury-</span>, ninth baronet  (1816&#150;1885), <span class="occ">politician and diarist</span>, was born at Harewood, Cornwall, on 2 June 1816, the elder son of Sir William Salusbury-Trelawny, the eighth baronet (1781&#150;1856), MP for East Cornwall (1832&#150;7), and his wife, Patience Christian (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of John Phillips Carpenter. The family, anciently landed in Cornwall, were baronets from 1628, owning 8000 acres in 1873; the third baronet was Sir Jonathan Trelawny, bishop of Bristol and Winchester, one of the seven bishops committed to the Tower by James II. Educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge (BA, 1839), John Trelawny, as he liked to be known, was called to the bar (Middle Temple, 1841) but never practised. A captain in the Royal Cornwall Rangers militia (1840), he later commanded the 2nd Cornwall rifles. A cultured man of wide interests, he published in 1842 with R. P. Collier, first Baron Monkswell, the future politician and judge, a translation of the first two books of Lucretius; to which he contributed book 1  (Wright, 449&#150;50). On 25 January the same year he married Harriet Jane (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of John Hearle Tremayne MP, of Heligan, Cornwall, with whom he had three children. He first stood for parliament in 1841, when he unsuccessfully contested his father's old constituency. From 1843 to 1852 and again from 1857 to 1865, he represented Tavistock; in the interval he fought Brighton, Liskeard, and Bedford. Finally, he sat for East Cornwall in 1868&#150;74.<br>
<br>By his death Trelawny had largely been forgotten; he rated a very brief obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In his day, he was a prominent back-bencher, a humane and usually realistic reformer, whose causes ranged from the deficiencies of Peel's <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span>, the subject of a pamphlet from him in 1847, to the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> regulating prostitution in naval ports and garrison towns. The almost surreptitious passage of the initial <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span> of 1864 was largely his doing: &#145;The danger&#146;, he observed, &#145;is not so much in what to say as in what to avoid saying&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diaries</span>, 286). He also championed the Maori against encroaching white settlers in New Zealand  (Steele, 356). It was, however, his sponsorship of successive church rates bills (1858&#150;63) on behalf of the Liberation Society that gave him considerable importance in the eyes of party leaders and whips. He is best described as a free-thinking gentry radical, and as such slightly old-fashioned even then. &#145;Old institutions&#146;, he wrote in 1862 &#145;&#151;even though imperfect or, in part, mischievous&#151;give a country, at least, a backbone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diaries</span>, 219). As a young man he had, however, advocated disestablishment, the basis of his claim in the 1840s to be an &#145;ultra Radical&#146;. Strongly conservative where individual, as distinct from corporate, property rights were concerned, he was far from orthodox, and a determined libertarian, in matters of belief. &#145;Desire is prayer, and prayer, if not a kind of blasphemy, is desire&#146;, he told himself  (ibid., 241). He brought in bills (1861&#150;3) to allow professed unbelievers to give sworn evidence in criminal cases, content, after he had failed to carry them, to be &#145;thought to sin with Hobbes and Bentham&#146;  (ibid., 163). Not surprisingly relations with his dissenting constituents in Tavistock were sometimes difficult. He steadily opposed &#145;a sour and sectarian observance of &hellip; Sunday&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 113, 31 July 1850, 587), and supported, on political rather than religious grounds, the Maynooth grant. As a result, he felt obliged to give up his seat, consistently with his often stated willingness to do so when he lost his electors' confidence. Tavistock took him back in 1857; he had the duke of Bedford's interest on his side, but he retired again in 1865, following local criticism of his conduct in advocating the Sunday opening of museums, and resisting legislation to close public houses on the same day. His years as a member for his native county were comparatively uneventful; worsening health ended his parliamentary career. A conscientious member of the royal commission on the Contagious Diseases Acts in 1870&#150;71, he defended them against a rising tide of criticism, publishing in 1872 an analysis of the commission's evidence.<br>
<br>It was Trelawny's dedication to religious freedom that made him the Liberation Society's shrewd, if incongruous, choice in 1857 to introduce its annual bills to abolish church rates. Independent but staunchly liberal, landed and titled, well liked in the house, he was more congenial to the Commons than a middle-class nonconformist radical. He never became a member of the society, nor did he by then sympathize with its ultimate goal of disestablishment. His aim, shared by most of those who voted with him, and by a few tories, was to redress a mainly symbolic but emotive grievance as part of a larger policy, deeply rooted in the whig past, of comprehension. &#145;It seems to me&#146;, he reflected, &#145;the terms of joining the Church should be made as broad and easy as possible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diaries</span>, 241). He emphasized that the church had many friends among dissenters, who did not wish to see her overthrown; she was in no real danger from the liberationists. He obtained varying majorities for his bill in 1858&#150;60, getting Palmerston's vote from 1859, although the Lords proved an insuperable obstacle. But from 1861 the tories, with the support of Gladstone and a handful of others on the Liberal side, were able to defeat Trelawny in the Commons; church rates were an open question in the Liberal cabinet. Increasingly uncomfortable with the militancy of Dr C. J. Foster, chairman of the liberationists' parliamentary committee, Trelawny desisted after 1863 from his attempts to pass their bill. Nevertheless, his efforts had brought the tories to the point where they introduced bills to exempt dissenters from the rate. Despite the so-called &#145;Conservative reaction&#146; of the early 1860s, which Trelawny found worrying, abolition was only a matter of time.<br>
<br>Trelawny's surviving diaries, published a century after his death, are a useful source for the period they cover. They preserve the cautiously progressive ambience of Palmerstonian parliaments, in which Trelawny's radicalism mellowed and he became a warm admirer of the premier: &#145;What a slave to his duty!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diaries</span>, 239). A master of parliamentary procedure, he was devoted to the house and to the deliberate political process it embodied: &#145;We educate each other&#146;  (ibid., 233).<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife, Trelawny married, in 1881, Harriet Jacqueline, widow of Colonel E. G. W. Keppel. He died at his London home, 25 Albert Gate, Knightsbridge, on 4 August 1885 and was succeeded as baronet by his son William.<br>
