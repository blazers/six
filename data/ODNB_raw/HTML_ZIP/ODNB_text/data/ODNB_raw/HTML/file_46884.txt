<span class="headword">Docker, Sir  Bernard Dudley Frank</span>  (1896&#150;1978), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born at Rotton Park Lodge, Edgbaston, on 9 August 1896, only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40832/', "Frank Dudley Docker (1862&#150;1944)")</script> and Lucy Constance (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of John Benbow Hebbert. His father was protective, arbitrary, and ambitious for him. He was educated at Harrow School (1911&#150;13) and by private tutors before being successfully crammed for the Oxford University entrance by A. L. Smith. However, in 1915, probably to forestall his conscription, he was put to work by his father in munitions production at the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon, and Finance Company. In 1918 he was appointed to its board, serving as deputy chairman in 1924&#150;7.<br>
<br>Despite an immaturity of character that lasted beyond adolescence, Docker was pushed by his father into other positions of responsibility and learned a certain business capacity. He was a member of the Birmingham advisory committee of the Midland Bank from 1925, and later a full board director (until obliged to resign in 1953 on account of his non-attendance at meetings and bad publicity surrounding him). He similarly graduated from the industrial management board to the board of directors of Vickers Ltd, and after his father's rupture with that company, was chairman of one of its competitors, the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (1930&#150;60). He held other important directorships in industrial, financial, electrical, and railway companies operating in Britain and abroad. He joined the board of the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1939.<br>
<br>In 1944, with his father's deathbed support, Docker consolidated his position by becoming both chairman and managing director of BSA. Its subsidiaries included a motorcycle company and Daimler Motors, manufacturers of limousines. Though the company enjoyed a burst of post-war prosperity, it had been riven by board factionalism for many years and had major difficulties of strategy and structure. A Warwickshire magistrate from 1924, in 1936 Docker became both chairman of Westminster Hospital and president of King Edward VII Memorial Hospital in Birmingham. He was created KBE in 1939, and encouraged political friends to press his claims for a baronetcy in 1941&#150;2.<br>
<br>Docker in April 1933 married an actress, Jeanne Stuart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ivy Sweet (1908&#150;2003), daughter of William James Sweet. This marriage was broken up by his father after a few months and was dissolved in January 1935. In 1949 Docker married his second wife, Norah (1905&#150;1983), widow of Sir William Collins, previously widow of Clement Callingham, and daughter of Sidney Turner, an unsuccessful Birmingham car salesman. Norah was a glamorous, excitable adventuress, and she shared Docker's dependence on alcohol. They had no children. Docker and his father had detested publicity, but his second wife courted cheap celebrity and together they were ruined by it. Her ostentation and interference in the Daimler business resulted in a notoriously protracted board-room struggle which culminated in Docker's dismissal from BSA in 1956. Hale and amiable within his own social set, in business he had the obstinacy of a weak man. Though puritanism and envy had a part in his downfall at BSA, he and his wife proved themselves to be foolhardy. This impression was confirmed when the Dockers were excluded from Monaco by Prince Rainier after a drunken nightclub row in 1958. His yacht <i>Shemara</i> (built to his specifications at a cost of &pound;100,000 in 1938) was later sold. His family power and fortune were thereafter dissipated.<br>
<br>Docker was physically imposing, with a sleek, opulent, and self-confident manner; in the 1950s he looked at the world with a glassy-eyed bonhomie, and showed many signs of soft living. Having sold his estate at Stockbridge in Hampshire for &pound;400,000 in 1966, he retired to Jersey. He died at Branksome Park, Dorset, following a stroke, on 22 May 1978. His father's hopes of an industrial dynasty died with him.<br>
