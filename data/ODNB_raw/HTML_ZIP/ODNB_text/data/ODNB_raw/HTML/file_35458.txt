<span class="headword">Peile,  John</span>  (1838&#150;1910), <span class="occ">college head and philologist</span>, born at Whitehaven, Cumberland, on 24 April 1838, was the only son of Williamson Peile FGS and his wife, Elizabeth Hodgson. Sir James Braithwaite Peile was his first cousin. His father died when he was five, and in 1848 he was sent to Repton School, of which his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21781/', "Thomas Williamson Peile")</script>, was then headmaster. He remained at Repton until his uncle's retirement in 1854. During the next two years he attended the school at St Bees, and in 1856 was entered at Christ's College, Cambridge. In 1859 he won the Craven scholarship, and in 1860 was bracketed with two others as senior classic, and with one of them as chancellor's medallist. He graduated BA in 1860 and proceeded MA in 1863. Having been elected a fellow of Christ's in 1860, and appointed assistant tutor and composition lecturer, he settled down to college and university work, which occupied him almost until his death. He took up the study of Sanskrit and comparative philology, and in 1865, and again in 1866, spent some time working with Professor Theodor Benfey at G&ouml;ttingen. On 26 July 1866 he married Annette (1835&#150;1920), daughter of William Cripps Kitchener and cousin of Lord Kitchener. He was obliged to vacate his fellowship on marriage but was re-elected in 1867.<br>
<br>Until the appointment of Professor Edward Byles Cowell in 1867, Peile was teacher of Sanskrit in the university; he had declined to stand for the chair so that another student of the subject might come to Cambridge. When Sanskrit became a subject in the classical tripos, he published a volume of <span class="italic">Notes on the Tale of Nala</span> (1881) to accompany the edition of the text by Professor Thomas Jarrett. He also corrected that edition, which in consequence of a difficult method of transliteration was very inaccurately printed. In 1869 appeared his book <span class="italic">An Introduction to Greek and Latin Etymology</span> of which there were two further editions. Later the point of view of comparative philologists changed to a marked degree, and Peile, who by this time was becoming more immersed in college and university business, allowed the book to go out of print. A little primer of <span class="italic">Philology</span> (1877) had for long a very wide circulation. To the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> he contributed the article on the alphabet and also articles on the individual letters. He was for many years a contributor to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, reviewing classical and philological publications. In 1904 he was elected a member of the British Academy.<br>
<br>Peile was tutor of his college from 1870 to 1884, when, on his appointment to the newly constituted post of university reader in comparative philology, which was not tenable with a college tutorship, he resigned, but remained a college lecturer. On the death of Dr Swainson in 1887 he was elected the first lay master of Christ's; it is supposed that he would have been elected in 1881, had the statutes then allowed it. He continued to lecture for the university until his election as vice-chancellor in 1891.<br>
<br>Peile's two years' tenure of the vice-chancellorship (1891&#150;3) was unusually eventful. The most important incident was the passing of an act of parliament, by which the perennial conflict of jurisdictions between &#145;town and gown&#146; was brought to an end satisfactory to both parties, the university surrendering its jurisdiction over persons not belonging to its own body and receiving representation on the town council. The controversy had reached an acute stage over a case of proctorial discipline, and the new arrangement was mainly due to Peile's broadmindedness and statesmanship. Henceforward he became more prominent than ever in the affairs of the university. While he was vice-chancellor a new chancellor&#151;Spencer Compton Cavendish, the eighth duke of Devonshire&#151;was installed; and Peile visited Dublin on the occasion of the tercentenary of Trinity College, which conferred upon him the honorary degree of LittD in 1892 (he had been one of the early recipients of the degree of LittD on its establishment at Cambridge in 1884).<br>
<br>In 1874 Peile had been elected a member of the council of the senate, a position which he held uninterruptedly for thirty-two years. With Professor Henry Sidgwick and Coutts Trotter he represented in the university the liberalizing movement then perhaps at the zenith of its influence. He was long an active supporter of women's education and a member of the council of Newnham College, and in the university controversy of 1897 on the question of &#145;women's degrees&#146; he advocated the opening to women of university degrees. &#145;His wisdom in giving advice in difficulties was equalled by his courage in defending the College in aspersions and attacks&#146;  (Gardner, 110). After the death of Professor Arthur Cayley in 1895 Peile became president of the council, and a new block of college buildings at Newnham was named after him. He was in favour of making Greek no longer compulsory on all candidates for admission to the university when the question was debated in 1891, and again in 1905 and 1906. He also took an active part in the university extension movement.<br>
<br>Although Peile never ceased to take an interest in comparative philology, and remained for many years an active and influential member of the special board for classics, most of his leisure, after he ceased to be vice-chancellor in 1893, was devoted to compiling a biographical register of the members of his college and of its forerunner, God's House, a work which entailed a great amount of research. In connection with this undertaking he wrote in 1900 a history of the college for Robinson's series of college histories. The first volume of his register (1448&#150;1665) was completed before Peile's death, which took place at the college, after a long illness, on 9 October 1910. He was buried on 12 October in the churchyard of Trumpington, the parish in which he lived before becoming master of Christ's College. He had, besides two children who died in infancy, two sons (for whom see Venn), and a daughter, Hester Mary, who married, in 1890, John Augustine Kempthorne, afterwards bishop of Lichfield.<br>
<br>Peile was a man of moderate views who had the faculty of remaining on good terms with his most active opponents. He was an effective speaker and a good chairman. As a college officer he was very popular, and the college prospered under him. As a lecturer on classical subjects (most frequently on Theocritus, Homer, Plautus, and Lucretius), and on comparative philology, he was able to put his views clearly and interestingly, and, like Charles Lamb, he sometimes found the slight hesitation in his speech a help in emphasizing a point. To him as much as anyone was due the successful study of comparative philology in Cambridge for a generation.<br>
