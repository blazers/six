<span class="headword">Staper,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1608), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the eldest surviving son of Rowland Staper (<i>d</i>. 1559), a London artisan clothworker and his otherwise unknown wife, Dorothy. He became free of his father's livery company by patrimony in 1559. Richard became involved in commerce, participating in the coastwise shipping of corn in the mid-1560s, and in trade with Spain from Ipswich and London. The 1568 port book shows him importing raisins, rice, almonds, silk, and taffeta from Spain. As English merchants re-entered the Mediterranean in the 1570s his trade interests broadened, and he became a pioneer of the Levant trades. Acting in conjunction with his trading partner, Edward Osborne, he sent two agents to Constantinople by way of Poland in 1575 with a view to obtaining a safe conduct for Osborne's factor and Staper's lifelong friend, William Harborne, who followed in 1578, and negotiated trading rights for English merchants equivalent to those already enjoyed by the French. It was a mission that had the backing of key figures in the government like Sir Francis Walsingham, who grasped the commercial opportunities of trade with Turkey. In 1581 Staper and Osborne were among the founder charter members of the Turkey Company, which traded as a joint stock company until 1588; four years later its merchants were subsumed in the newly formed Levant Company, which brought in the rival Venice merchants and operated as a regulated company. Staper was also named a member of the Eastland Company in 1579, and he was a member of the group formed in 1585 around Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester (including the earl's secretary Arthur Atye, and another London merchant Alexander Avenon) that traded in partnership to Morocco, Staper contributing &pound;800 of the starting capital of &pound;5000.<br>
<br>The expanding horizons of Staper's business ventures were reflected in his growing wealth, his subsidy assessments rising from &pound;20 in 1564 to &pound;80 in 1582, and &pound;100 in 1589. This may not have put him at the pinnacle of the plutocratic &eacute;lite, but he was numbered among the wealthiest 2 per cent of the capital's inhabitants. Like all in his class he pursued a marital politics designed to cement his business position. On 22 April 1567 he had married Denise or Dionis, the daughter of Thomas Hewett (<i>d</i>. 1576), another clothworker, and brother of Alderman Sir William Hewett (<i>d</i>. 1567), whose daughter and heir Staper's partner Osborne had married, and in whose house Denise was lodged shortly before the marriage. His loyalty to the Hewett family is suggested by Staper's giving the name Hewitt to one of his sons, and the connections may have been crucial in giving Staper much needed start-up capital: Denise received &pound;200 from her uncle Alderman Hewett. Staper's own children moved into advantageous marriages, his daughter Joanne marrying Nicholas Leate, and his son marrying the daughter of Roger Owfield (bringing a portion of &pound;3000), both leading Levant merchants themselves. Another daughter, Mary (who predeceased him), married the prominent city lawyer James Altham.<br>
<br>Staper's religious position is not crystal clear. His will breathes a more than conventional piety, but it is not specifically Calvinist. In it he bequeathed his soul to God<blockquote>nothing doubting but that for his infinite mercies sake set forth in the precious blood of his dearly beloved son Jesus Christ our only saviour and redeemer he will receive my soul into his glory and place it in the company of heavenly angels and blessed saints which God grant me for his mercies sake. Amen. (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/112, fol. 120)</blockquote>His faith was enmeshed in his business affairs; as a pioneer in commercial expansion, he seems to have been the moving force behind the Clothworkers' patronage of their propagandist and evangelist Richard Hakluyt, whose exhibition the company remarkably continued to pay after he left Oxford. Staper knew that his factors, captains, and sailors risked their lives in the Mediterranean trades, prey for the persecuting inquisitors of Spain, as well as Barbary pirates seeking lucrative ransoms. Two of his sons appear to have lost their lives in the Mediterranean, one at least suffering persecution at the hands of the Spanish Inquisition. Richard Haselton recognized Staper's efforts on behalf of redeeming captives (&#145;the pattern of bounty&#146;; <span class="italic">Strange and wonderfull things</span>, preface), but his captivity narrative, published by William Barley and dedicated to Staper in 1595, seems to have reserved its real venom for the Spanish. That said, Staper's anti-Spanish sentiments did not apparently extend to support for privateering, which merely encouraged Barbary reprisals against legitimate trade. When he died he made the kind of charitable bequests conventional for a man of his standing, with bequests to the suburban poor, the prisons, and hospitals, but his pragmatism characteristically shines through in the bequest of &pound;20 to the parish of St Martin Outwich for the building of shops at the east end of the church, the income from which might defray the cost of church repair.<br>
<br>Although Staper fined out of the office of alderman on his election in 1594, he did not neglect city politics. He was a common councillor of Broad Street ward from 1576 onwards, an active committee man, and governor of St Thomas's Hospital from 1590 to 1602. He was equally active in company affairs, first serving as warden in 1570 at the unusually young age of thirty, and reaching the office of master in 1590&#150;91. Perhaps he was impatient with city feasting; in 1570 he sought to escape the obligation to provide his fellow liverymen with two quarter dinners, but offered to wainscot the company's armoury instead. He was one of those merchant princes who, probably because he was never a merchant adventurer, retained the confidence of the artisan clothworkers, who turned to him for support in their campaign against merchants exporting undressed cloth.<br>
<br>In July 1605 a letter to Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury (to whom he seems to have been quite close), complaining about the decay of the Levant trade he had done so much to foster, Staper noted that &#145;I am old and almost past trade; I have but one son left&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP14/15, fol. 4). But there are few indications that he was winding down his commercial enterprises in later years. He was a founder member of the East India Company with a subscription of &pound;800 in 1599; about the same time only five merchants are listed as having more factors than Staper in the Levant; he was presumably the Mr Staper with whom the astrologer Simon Forman discussed the affairs of Virginia over dinner in 1604; and in his will he refers to &#145;divers adventures to come in which were in foreign countries or on the seas&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/112, fol. 121<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Staper died suddenly on 30 June 1608 while taking supper. He had asked that he be buried in the church of St Martin Outwich &#145;under my father's stone upon which I will there be a memory made both of my father and me&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/112, fol. 120). In the event Staper stole the show. The monument, which was later moved to St Helen, Bishopsgate, recorded that:<blockquote>he was the greatest merchant in his time, the chiefest actor in discovery of the trades of Turkey and East India: a man humble in prosperity, painful and ever ready in the affairs public, and discreetly careful of his private, a liberal housekeeper, bountiful to the poor, an upright dealer in the world, and a devout aspirer after the world to come, much blest in his posterity and happy in his and their alliances (Stow, 188)</blockquote>.<br>
