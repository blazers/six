<span class="headword">Burbidge family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1870&#150;1966), <span class="occ">department store managers and directors</span>, were managing directors and chairmen of Harrods from 1893 to 1959, through three generations. The first member of the family to enter the business was <a name="cosubject_46793"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Burbidge</span>, first baronet  (1847&#150;1917)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 2 March 1847 at Manor Farm, South Wraxhall, Wiltshire, the fifth of ten children of George Bishop Burbidge (1795&#150;1861), farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke (1808/9&#150;1873). Burbidge attended schools in Devizes, then spent two years at Dr Gilchrist's Spa Villa Academy in Melksham. On his father's death Burbidge was apprenticed to Jonathan Puckeridge, a grocer and wine merchant originally from Wiltshire then trading in Oxford Street, London. After his apprenticeship and a year as an assistant, Burbidge established his own successful grocery business in Marylebone. Burbidge's association with Wiltshire continued and he was president for many years of the Wiltshiremen in London society.<br>
<br>On 9 May 1868 Burbidge married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1905), youngest daughter of Jeremiah Woodman of Melksham, Wiltshire; they had two sons and four daughters. Burbidge enjoyed her help and support until her death. On 22 August 1910 he married his second wife, Lilian, youngest daughter of James Ambrose Preece, of Bartestree Court, Herefordshire. In his private life Burbidge was a devoted husband and father, and he kept in regular contact with his mother and siblings.<br>
<br>When Burbidge became aware that large department stores were coming into favour he worked for several, taking a post as superintendent for the Army and Navy Auxiliary, and as manager at Whiteleys and at the West Kensington Stores, before being appointed general manager at Harrods Stores Ltd in 1891, two years after its flotation on Charles Digby Harrod's retirement from his thriving family business in 1889.<br>
<br>Burbidge was appointed managing director of Harrods in 1893. The minutes of a board meeting held on 6 June 1917, immediately after his death, record that:<blockquote>It was resolved to record the Directors' very high appreciation of his uprightness of character and outstanding commercial ability during his many years with the Company &hellip; Under his Managing Directorship the trade has enormously expanded, until it now reaches to all parts of the world, while during this period the annual profit has increased from &pound;16,071 to &pound;309,227 before the War. The staff has increased from 200 to 6000, and the hours of employment have been substantially reduced and the working conditions improved all round. His was an attractive and charming personality; he endeared himself to all with whom he came into daily contact. His loss will be felt not only at Harrods but in wider circles outside.</blockquote>Burbidge pioneered benefits for shop assistants. The store closed at 6 p.m., not 9, 10, or even 11 p.m. as was common. He instituted one day early closing long before the <span class="roman">Shops Act</span> came into force, set up a well-appointed staff sports club, organized training schemes, and established both provident and pension funds for staff. Burbidge himself, however, worked long hours. He rose at 5.30 a.m., rode in nearby Hyde Park from 6 to 6.45, left for Harrods at 6.55, and after a gruelling schedule of work, meetings, and decision making, returned home about 7 p.m.<br>
<br>Burbidge's success lay in anticipating and developing demand for services and products in Harrods. He had objected to lifts as &#145;new machines&#146;, but in 1898 he allowed a French company to install the first escalator in Britain. It attracted enormous publicity, and was a great convenience for customers. His refreshment rooms, with food at reasonable prices, encouraged ladies to linger shopping in the store, and &#145;retiring or dressing rooms&#146; were provided for their comfort. The lavish decoration created between 1894 and 1911 was unrivalled. Burbidge held directorships in other stores including Dickins and Jones Ltd, the Hudson Bay Company, and Harrods (Buenos Aires) Ltd, which he founded in 1913.<br>
<br>Burbidge sat on government and charitable committees which benefited from his skills for organization and business. He was honorary treasurer of the tariff commission; a member of the commission looking into the wages of Post Office workers; one of the Crystal Palace trustees, a group that made possible the purchase of the Crystal Palace for the nation in 1913 (Burbidge donated &pound;2500 publicly and &pound;30,000 anonymously to the fund); and he served on the committees of the Discharged Soldiers' and Sailors' Association and the National Association for the Employment of ex-Soldiers. He gave aid, both personally and through his association with Harrods, to the Ministry of Munitions, and was chairman of the committee on the Royal Aircraft Factory and of the executive and war emergency committees for the provision of invalid kitchens. Burbidge provided premises and organized operations for Queen Alexandra's Field Fund Force, King Albert's Civilian Hospital Fund, and Lady French's Fund. He set up a successful scheme for training women, in reduced circumstances because of the war, to take up business careers. He was a religious man and had been a churchwarden. He was also a justice of the peace for London county. In 1916 he was awarded a baronetcy in the new year's honours list. He died at his London home, 51 Hans Mansions, Knightsbridge, after a full day at work on 31 May 1917 and was buried on 5 June at Littleton Park, Shepperton. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Burbidge was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_56175"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Richard) Woodman Burbidge</span>, second baronet  (1872&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 7 December 1872 at 35 Upper George Street, Marylebone, London. Educated at St Marylebone Grammar School, he joined Harrods Stores Ltd in 1893, becoming general manager in 1901. On the death of his father in 1917 he became the second baronet, and was appointed managing director of Harrods Stores Ltd, by then the biggest store in the country. He became chairman in 1921, a post he held until his death in 1945, retiring as managing director in 1935. He also sat on the boards of Dickins and Jones Ltd, D. H. Evans Ltd, and Kendal Milne &amp; Co., Manchester, which together formed the Harrods Group, as well as of Harrods (Buenos Aires) Ltd. He travelled frequently to North and South America on business.<br>
<br>Burbidge served on many committees including the Ministry of Munitions stores purchases advisory council, the Ministry of Munitions staff investigation committee, and the Empire Marketing Board, and he was treasurer of the Tariff Board. Burbidge was appointed CBE in 1919, a commander of the order of Leopold II of Belgium by King Albert in 1920, in recognition of organizing the construction, by Harrods Stores Ltd, of hospitals and airsheds behind the Belgian front line, and in 1917 he received the Marie Regina cross of Romania for organizing relief for Romanian refugees. Burbidge inherited his father's capacity for work, but also enjoyed sports such as coursing, horse-racing, and yachting.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1896 Burbidge married Catherine Jemima (1872&#150;1964), daughter of Henry Grant of Sodbury House, Great Clacton, Essex; they had one son, Richard Grant Woodman Burbidge, and three daughters. Burbidge always affectionately referred to his wife as Mother when talking to staff, and they both took a great interest in the Harrodian Sports Club, Lady Burbidge presenting prizes at the Harrodian Club annual sports days long after her husband's death. Both ensured that staff amenities improved, providing a clinic, staff bank, and staff and buyers' councils. Burbidge was a religious man and he encouraged staff in religious studies, and he and Lady Burbidge regularly attended the staff <span class="roman">Bible</span> study group meetings.<br>
<br>Burbidge was involved in the building of the YWCA headquarters in London (completed in 1932), and the Purley Schools (for orphans of employees in the textile trade) benefited to the sum of &pound;53,716 during his year as appeals chairman.<br>
<br>Burbidge died at his country home, Cisswood, Lower Beeding, Horsham, on 3 June 1945 and was buried at Littleton on 7 June. Queen Marie of Yugoslavia was represented among the large gathering at his memorial service at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, on 11 June. He was succeeded by his son, <a name="cosubject_56174"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Grant Woodman Burbidge</span>, third baronet  (1897&#150;1966)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at 53 Stanhope Gardens, Kensington, London, on 23 June 1897. Burbidge was educated at Rugby School and commissioned into the army in 1914. He served in the RASC and saw action with the 47th division train, rising to the rank of captain. He trained in the retail trade in America in 1919 before joining Harrods Ltd in 1920. He succeeded his father as managing director in 1935, and was chairman from 1945 until 1959, when the Harrods Group was taken over by House of Fraser. He served for a while as managing director under Hugh Fraser but the two men did not get on. Burbidge later held directorships at British Home Stores Ltd and Maple &amp; Co. Ltd. During the Second World War he was one of the civilians on the board of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes.<br>
<br>Burbidge married Gladys Amelia, eldest daughter of Charles Frederick Kearley, a contractor of Kensington, on 14 October 1925. They had a son and daughter. This marriage was dissolved, and on 6 December 1946 he married a widow, Joan Elizabeth Hamilton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mosley. Very much the traditionalist in his manner, he was well liked by his staff, most of whom he knew by name, and considered charming by all who knew him. Burbidge was appointed CBE in 1946. He died at his home, Walnut Tree Cottage, Ashampstead, Berkshire, on 2 February 1966. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Under the careful direction of the Burbidge family Harrods attained its status as the biggest, most elegant and best stocked of London's great department stores. The magnificent terracotta building became one of the capital's landmarks and the many departments, particularly the vast food halls, earned a worldwide reputation for quality.<br>
