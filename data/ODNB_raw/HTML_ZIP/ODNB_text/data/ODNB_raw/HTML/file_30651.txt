<span class="headword">Bayliss, Sir  Wyke</span>  (1835&#150;1906), <span class="occ">painter and writer</span>, was born at Madeley, Shropshire, on 21 October 1835, the second son of John Cox Bayliss of Prior's Leigh and Anne Wyke. His father was a railway engineer and a successful teacher of military and mathematical drawing. At an early age Bayliss showed an aptitude for drawing, and studied under his father, from whom he obtained the sound knowledge of perspective and architecture which influenced his later career as a painter. He was educated at Marlborough House, London, and later attended the Royal Academy Schools and the School of Design at Somerset House.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1858 Bayliss married Elizabeth Letitia (<i>b</i>. 1835/6), daughter of a French protestant minister, Isaac Broade of Longton, Staffordshire; they had no children. From the first Bayliss's interest lay entirely in depicting architecture, and his whole life as an artist was spent in painting, in oil and watercolour, the interiors of cathedrals and churches. A very competent draughtsman and colourist, he defended himself against those who attacked his choice of subjects by saying that it is in the &#145;infinite variety of the aspect of a Cathedral interior that I find its infinite charm&#146;  (Bayliss, 18). He exhibited twice at the Royal Academy, sending <span class="italic">La Sainte-Chapelle</span> in 1865 and <span class="italic">Treves Cathedral</span> and <span class="italic">Strasbourg Cathedral</span> in 1879. His best work was given to the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists, of which he was elected a member in 1865. In 1888 he became president of the society in succession to James Abbott McNeill Whistler (with whom he had his disagreements) and until the close of his life he held this office, for which his geniality, ability as an orator, wide artistic sympathies, and energy were well adapted. He was notably supportive of women as professional artists, and believed that exhibitions of the Royal Society of British Artists should always &#145;include something new and strange&#146;, so as to avoid &#145;conventionalism, and smug contentment with past achievements&#146;  (ibid., 158).<br>
<br>Bayliss was also renowned as an author. For his contemporaries the best-known of his books was <span class="italic">Rex regum</span> (1898; rev. edn, 1902), an elaborate study of the traditional likenesses of Christ. The most enduring of his works, however, has proved to be <span class="italic">Five Great Painters of the Victorian Era</span> (1902), in which he wrote on Frederic Leighton, John Everett Millais, Edward Burne-Jones, George Frederick Watts, and William Holman Hunt. In his <span class="italic">Seven Angels of the Renascence</span> (1905), a blending of fact and sentiment, he gave his views upon seven selected great masters and their influence upon the art of the middle ages. Among his other publications were <span class="italic">The Elements of Aerial Perspective</span> (1885); <span class="italic">The Witness of Art</span> (1876; 2nd edn, 1878); and <span class="italic">The Higher Life in Art</span> (1879; 2nd edn, 1888). Bayliss also published a short volume of poems entitled <span class="italic">Saecula tria: an Allegory of Life</span> (1857); on occasion he wrote poetry to accompany his paintings. Before his death he completed <span class="italic">Olives: the Reminiscences of a President</span>, which was edited by his wife and published, with a preface by Frederick Wedmore, in 1906.<br>
<br>Bayliss, who was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1870, was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1897. He was an accomplished chess player and keen cyclist. He died at his home, 7 North Road, Clapham Park, London, on 5 April 1906, and was buried at Streatham cemetery; his wife survived him. A memorial was placed in the church of Madeley, Shropshire, his birthplace.<br>
