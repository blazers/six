<span class="headword">Kidd,  Thomas</span>  (1770&#150;1850), <span class="occ">classical scholar and schoolmaster</span>, was the son of Thomas Kidd of Kidd, Yorkshire. He was educated at Giggleswick School under William Paley before being entered on 14 December 1789 as a sizar of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took the degrees of BA (as fifth junior optime) in 1794 and MA in 1797. He was for some time second master of Merchant Taylors' School, and in 1818 was appointed headmaster of King's Lynn School; he next became master of Wymondham School, and lastly of Norwich School. He was ordained deacon in 1798, priest in 1799, and was instituted successively to: the rectory of St James Garlickhythe, London, in 1802; the rectory of Croxton, Cambridgeshire, in 1813; the vicarage of Eltisley, Cambridgeshire, in 1814; the vicarage of Bedingham, Norfolk, in 1831; and, for a second time, both the vicarage of Eltisley and the rectory of Croxton in 1835. In 1801 he married Miss Smith, of Hoxton Square, London.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Kidd became acquainted with Richard Porson, who was considerably his senior, and his affection and reverence for him influenced his whole life. He had one of his sons christened Richard Bentley Porson. Though himself a genuine Greek scholar and steeped in Greek literature, he is chiefly remembered for editing the critical works of others. Thus he edited Ruhnken's minor works (1807), Dawes's <span class="italic">Miscellanea critica</span> (1817), as well as the very valuable volume of Porson's <span class="italic">Tracts and Miscellaneous Criticisms</span> (1815). He took especial interest in collecting lists of the works of several of the chief English and Dutch scholars. In his preface to <span class="italic">Opuscula Ruhnkeniana</span> there is a complete list of Thomas Tyrwhitt's works, while his collation of Tyrwhitt's smaller pieces is in the Dyce collection which was bequeathed to the South Kensington (later the Victoria and Albert) Museum. In his review of Sluiter's <span class="italic">Lectiones andocideae</span> in the <span class="italic">British Critick</span> for October 1805 he catalogues Valckenaer's criticisms and classical editions. It was due to him that the collection of Richard Bentley's books, which had lain neglected at James Lackington's bookshop, was in 1807 rescued and obtained for the British Museum. Most of the printed books were annotated by Bentley, and Kidd also found several unfinished works in manuscript. At one time he contemplated an edition of Homer, and wrote a series of lengthy criticisms on the Grenville edition in the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> for 1803 and 1804. He contributed a variety of essays and reviews to several journals. His &#145;Imperfect outline of the life of R. P.&#146; was prefixed to Porson's <span class="italic">Tracts and Miscellaneous Criticisms</span>. His English style is sometimes confused, and always quaint. Despite his veneration of the scholars whose works he catalogued or edited, his own methods were disorganized and his learning ill-digested. One of his footnotes extends to twenty pages. In 1842 Lord Melbourne gave him a civil-list pension of &pound;100 &#145;in token of his services as a scholar and an instructor of youth for nearly half a century&#146;. He died at Croxton, Cambridgeshire, on 27 August 1850, and was buried in Croxton churchyard.<br>
