<span class="headword">Warner, Sir  Frederick Archibald <span class="st"> [Fred]</span></span>  (1918&#150;1995), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was born on 2 May 1918 at Blagdon, McKinley Road, Bournemouth, the son of Lieutenant-Commander Frederick Archibald Warner (<i>d</i>. 1918), a British naval officer who was born in Trinidad and killed on active service a few weeks before his son's birth, and his widow, Marjorie Miller, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Winants, of New Jersey, USA, who had become a naturalized British subject in 1917. His mother subsequently remarried, and Warner acquired two younger half-brothers. Fred Warner (as he was invariably known) was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth (1932&#150;5), and after brief periods at sea as a midshipman between 1935 and 1937 he went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, and read politics, philosophy, and economics for two years before the outbreak of the Second World War caused his recall to the navy as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He rose to the temporary acting rank of lieutenant-commander and spent the last years of the war commanding gunboats and working with British and Italian small boat missions in the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>In February 1946, at the age of twenty-eight, Warner entered the diplomatic service and served in the southern department of the Foreign Office, where he was quickly identified as an officer of great promise. He was transferred to be private secretary to the minister of state, Hector McNeal, and consequently had the misfortune to work alongside Guy Burgess. Before the latter's defection to the Soviet Union, Warner was himself posted to Moscow as a first secretary between March 1950 and November 1951, and he did well there in the difficult cold war years. The news of Burgess's defection (with Donald Maclean) was a serious set-back to Warner's career. He was known to have been a friend as well as a close colleague of Burgess, and when the latter's louche lifestyle was disclosed after his defection Warner was among those who were thought either to have been tainted by it or&#151;at the least&#151;to have been dilatory in not drawing it to the attention of higher authority. Warner's own lifestyle was somewhat flamboyant: a bachelor of private means, he lived elegantly in chambers in the Albany and moved in exotic as well as distinguished social circles. He was subjected to intensive scrutiny not only by the security services but also by the press. While a question mark appeared to hover over his future, he was posted in June 1956 as head of Chancery in a distant and less than mainstream country&#151;Burma.<br>
<br>It was much to Warner's credit that he put his heart and energies into his new job: he was reported by his superiors to have &#145;taken the embassy by the scruff of the neck&#146;  (private information) and he displayed efficiency, decision, and leadership. It was for him the beginning of a long affection for the Far East, and after a short spell in Athens, from September 1958 to November 1959, he was appointed head of the south-east Asia department of the Foreign Office at the time of confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia. He continued to burn the candle at both ends, being seen on occasion coming into the Foreign Office in the early morning, straight from a nightclub and still in a dinner-jacket, to draft a lucid and forceful submission to ministers. But, possibly because he still felt insecure in the diplomatic service, he applied for adoption as a Conservative parliamentary candidate in 1963, the year in which he was appointed CMG. Since his candidature failed he remained in the service and was sent on a year's course to the Imperial Defence College, where he upset some of his military classmates by his obvious air of superiority.<br>
<br>Warner's first ambassadorial appointment was to Laos in May 1965, where his handling of the increasing instability of the region won him further praise. By now the shadow over his career had been finally dispelled and&#151;as if to prove it&#151;he was appointed to the sensitive job of minister at the UK delegation to NATO in October 1967. This in turn was followed by an appointment as the UK deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in New York in September 1969. Warner took naturally and happily to the lively social scene in New York, and it was while he was there that on 29 March 1971 he astonished his friends by marrying at the age of fifty-two. His bride was Simone Georgina, daughter of Colonel Hubert Jocelyn Nangle, and divorcee of Boz de Ferranti of the armaments firm. She had a daughter from her previous marriage, and she and Warner quickly consolidated their happy marriage with the birth of two sons, in 1972 and 1974.<br>
<br>Warner's last post in the diplomatic service was as ambassador to Japan from July 1972 to June 1975. He and his wife had previously spent some months at Sheffield University acquiring a very useful knowledge of the language, and Warner brought great zest to the job. He was notably successful in encouraging trade relations, and he made the embassy a cosmopolitan meeting-place for peoples of different cultures and backgrounds. If the Japanese were sometimes bewildered by his unconventional approach, they none the less admired his energy and style. His mission was crowned by a successful state visit by the queen, after which Warner was made a GCVO in 1975. He had already been knighted (KCMG) on his appointment to Tokyo.<br>
<br>Warner had hoped to end his diplomatic career as ambassador in Paris, and when this was denied him he took early retirement, despite a last-minute offer of the job as UK representative to the EC. One reason for this was a genuine desire&#151;possibly prompted by his own fatherless childhood&#151;to play an active role in bringing up his young children. Warner also threw himself into a wide variety of new activities: he had for many years owned a farm in Dorset which he now took in hand; he was elected as a Conservative member of the European parliament representing Somerset; and he played an active role in Strasbourg, particularly in Far Eastern affairs, from 1979 to 1984. He later took on the chairmanship of the Wessex region of the National Trust. He also served as a non-executive director on the boards of a number of large companies with international interests, as well as being chairman of the overseas committee of the Confederation of British Industry. Warner lived latterly at Inkpen House, near Newbury, Berkshire, and in London. He died at his London home, 13A Portobello Road, Kensington, of lung cancer, on 30 September 1995. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and stepdaughter. Tall, striking, and immensely persuasive in conversation, Warner was a larger-than-life figure in the establishment worlds in which he had made his career. There was a raffishness in his manner which concealed a deeply serious character: he would have been at home in the eighteenth-century world of Charles James Fox. Warner could be a daunting figure on first acquaintance, but he won affection as well as admiration from a diverse and powerful circle of friends.<br>
