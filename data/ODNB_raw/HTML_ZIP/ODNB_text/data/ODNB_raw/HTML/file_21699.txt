<span class="headword">Pears,  Steuart Adolphus</span>  (1815&#150;1875), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born at Pirbright, Surrey, on 20 November 1815, the seventh son of the Revd James Pears (1777/8&#150;1853), headmaster of Bath grammar school, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21700/', "Sir Thomas Townsend Pears")</script>. Pears was educated at Bath under his father, and was elected scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1832. After graduating BA in June 1836 with a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, he was elected fellow of Corpus, remaining in residence until 1838. He then became tutor to Lord Goderich (the first marquess of Ripon), of whom he took charge until 1842. In 1839 he gained the Ellerton theological prize for an essay entitled <span class="italic">The Conduct and Character of St Paul</span>, and in 1841 the Denyer theological prize for an essay entitled <span class="italic">The Divinity of Our Lord</span>. He was ordained deacon in 1839 and priest in 1842. In 1843 he was sent abroad by the Parker Society to search the libraries of Z&uuml;rich and other places for correspondence relating to the English Reformation. In the course of his researches he discovered a number of original letters in Latin from Sir Philip Sidney to his friend Hubert Languet, which he translated and published on his return (1845). During 1844 and 1845 he was in residence at Oxford as dean of Corpus Christi College. In 1846 he was appointed fellow and tutor of Durham University, and in 1847, at the age of thirty-two, assistant master at Harrow School under C. J. Vaughan. In December 1847 he married Catherine Temple (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1866), the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5256/', "Temple Chevallier")</script>, professor of mathematics and Hebrew in Durham University. He took the degrees of BD in 1846 and DD in 1851, when he published the sermons he delivered at Harrow, following these in 1852 with <span class="italic">Remarks on the Protestant Theory of Church Music</span>. He remained at Harrow until 1854, when he was elected headmaster of Repton School. At the time there were about fifty boys in the school, many of them village boys; the schoolhouse contained only two or three classrooms, and there were two boarding-houses.<br>
<br>Under Pears Repton achieved the standing of a leading public school. Influenced by the example of Rugby School during his period under Dr Vaughan, a pupil of Thomas Arnold, he instigated and helped to finance the building of a chapel following the celebration of the tercentenary of the school in 1857. At about the same time he built a boarding-house. Over the next few years, he built classrooms, fives-courts, and a library; and several other boarding-houses were erected during his headmastership. In 1862 the Repton School football rules were drawn up, and the first cricket fixture with Uppingham School was held in 1865. Pears published several school sermons, including <span class="italic">Short Sermons on the Elements of Christian Truth</span> (1861), <span class="italic">Sundays at School: Short Sermons Preached in Repton School Chapel</span> (1870), and various addresses, including <span class="italic">Mind and Body: and Moral Influence</span> (1855). He gave evidence in 1865 to the schools inquiry commission, chaired by Lord Taunton, when he indicated a commitment to the traditional curriculum and a scepticism towards the teaching of science. He attended the first Headmasters' Conference, held at Uppingham in 1869, and subsequently ensured that the new scheme for the constitution of Repton, agreed with the endowed schools' commissioners in 1874, secured its status as a first-grade school, catering for boys aged ten and over.<br>
<br>One of Pears's most distinguished pupils, William Sanday, recalled his &#145;spare rather tall figure&#146; and &#145;his distinguished, somewhat worn and aquiline features&#146;. He had a grave, almost austere, manner, and a natural dignity and authority, which did not need to be reinforced by corporal punishment  (Macdonald, 174&#150;5). The strain of seeing through the new constitution told on his health in the years following the death of his wife (<i>c</i>.1866), and he resigned the headmastership in 1874. On his retirement, pupil numbers had risen to nearly 300. Pears was shortly afterwards presented by the president and fellows of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to the living of Childrey, Berkshire, where he died on 15 December 1875. A fine speech-room, named after him, was subsequently erected at Repton in his memory.<br>
