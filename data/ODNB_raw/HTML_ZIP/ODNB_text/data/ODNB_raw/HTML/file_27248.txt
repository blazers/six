<span class="headword">Thomas,  William Luson</span>  (1830&#150;1900), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and newspaper proprietor</span>, the son of William Thomas, a shipbroker, and his wife, Alicia Hayes, was born on 4 December 1830 in London. Little is known of his early life, though he was educated at Fulham, Middlesex. After leaving school he joined his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27220/', "George Housman Thomas (1824&#150;1868)")</script> in Paris, where he had set up an engraving business with his brother-in-law, H. Harrison. He learned engraving from his brother and became the major engraver of his work. In 1846 he travelled to the United States with George and Harrison to work on illustrated newspapers, including <span class="italic">The Republic</span> and the <span class="italic">Picture Gallery</span>. After returning to England because of George's ill health, the brothers travelled to Rome, where William studied art at the Acad&eacute;mie de France. The large artistic community in which he mixed there gave him a unique insight into artistic life, which proved invaluable for his later career in art journalism.<br>
<br>In 1851 Thomas became an assistant to W. J. Linton in London and established himself as a leading engraver. On 12 July 1855 he married Annie Carmichael, daughter of the marine artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4703/', "John Wilson Carmichael (1799&#150;1868)")</script>; among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36473/', "George Holt Thomas")</script>. Between 1852 and 1855 he worked from an office at 17 Essex Street, the Strand, which he shared with the wood-engraver Horace Harral. In 1856 Thomas and Harral moved to 11 Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, and in 1860 to 4 Palgrave Place, the Strand. During this period he engraved and illustrated many books and periodicals, including Edward Macdermott's <span class="italic">The Merrie Days of England</span> (1859), Hans Christian Andersen's <span class="italic">Eventyr, fortalte for b&oslash;rn</span> (as <span class="italic">Tales for Children</span>, 1861), and the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. By 1868 his engraving business brought him an annual income of some &pound;800. He continued to paint for leisure and achieved some distinction as a watercolourist, exhibiting regularly at the Suffolk Street Gallery from 1860. He became an associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1864, where he exhibited regularly until his death in 1900. He became a full member of the society in 1875 and an RI when it achieved royal status in 1884. In 1868 his brother died: deeply grieved, he planned to produce an <i>in memoriam</i> volume of his work for the benefit of his widow and her family. It was published in 1869 as <span class="italic">One Hundred of the Best Drawings by George Housman Thomas</span> and included many of George's book and small magazine illustrations, but none of his work for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. The periodical had refused to lend the woodblocks of George's drawings for publication, a decision which both angered William and strengthened his resolution to set up an illustrated newspaper in opposition to the weekly, which had hitherto held off any rivals.<br>
<br>&#145;I was ready&#146;, Thomas wrote , &#145;for some big, interesting, far-reaching enterprise&#146;  (Thomas, 81)&#151;the founding of an illustrated weekly newspaper characterized by artistic excellence. His good business sense was combined with a rare eye for talent and a deep sympathy and understanding of artists and their working methods, something quite unknown at that time for the director of a pictorial weekly. He later wrote of the unique philosophy which characterized <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>:<blockquote>The originality of the scheme consisted in establishing a weekly illustrated journal open to all artists, whatever their method, instead of confining my staff to draughtsmen on wood as had been hitherto the general custom. &hellip; it was a bold idea to attempt a new journal at the price of sixpence a copy in the face of the most successful and firmly established paper in the world, costing then only fivepence. (ibid.)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">The Graphic</span> was an immediate success and became known for the excellence of its wood-engravings and the notable artists who worked on the paper, some of whom included Luke Fildes, Hubert von Herkomer, A. B. Houghton, Frederick Walker, and William Small. The format of the paper offered artists an unprecedented opportunity to explore social subjects, and its images of poverty made it a catalyst for the development of social realism in British art. Many of the wood-engravings which it featured were developed into major paintings: Luke Fildes's <span class="italic">Houseless and Hungry</span>, which appeared in the first edition on 4 December 1869, became the celebrated painting <span class="italic">Applicants for Admission to a Casual Ward</span> (1874, Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, University of London, Egham), exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1874.<br>
<br>Thomas established the Graphic Gallery to complement the periodical and he commissioned artists of stature to paint images for the paper's summer and winter colour supplements. He also commissioned several notable series, including <span class="roman">Shakespeare's Heroines</span>, portrayed by artists such as Leighton and Alma-Tadema, which were exhibited at the gallery and engraved in the paper. <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> also serialized and illustrated fiction, including Thomas Hardy's <span class="italic">Tess of the D'Urbervilles</span>, which was illustrated by Herkomer and a select group of his students. With the development of photography and new print techniques the artistic quality of the images declined, but even here Thomas saw a new opportunity: in 1890 he established the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span>, the first daily illustrated paper published in England. He died on 16 October 1900 at Weir Cottage, Chertsey, Surrey, and was cremated at Woking, Surrey, on 19 October. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Thomas's achievement was impressive. The influence of <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> within the art world was immense: among its many admirers were Vincent Van Gogh, and Hubert von Herkomer, who wrote that Thomas &#145;did more &hellip; than improve illustrated journalism, he influenced English art, and that in a wholesome way&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Oct 1900, 9). A precise, good-natured man, Thomas was involved with many charitable works, including the Artists' Benevolent Institution and the Prince of Wales Hospital Fund. His obituarist in <span class="italic">The Sketch</span> (24 October 1900, 8) described him somewhat unctuously as &#145;Fair-bearded till time and hard work silvered his hair, &hellip; Mr. Thomas was a true gentleman&#151;one, indeed, of Nature's noblemen.&#146;<br>
