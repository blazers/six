<span class="headword">Wakefield <span class="st"> [Wakefeld]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1537/8), <span class="occ">Hebraist</span>, was born in Yorkshire, probably to an influential Pontefract family; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28411/', "Thomas Wakefield")</script> was his brother. Nothing is known about his early life. He was admitted BA at the University of Cambridge on 9 June 1514, determining in arts in the following year. On 14 July 1516 he was elected to a fellowship of Clare College, Cambridge, and by 1518 he was already a friend of John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, to whom he taught Hebrew. On 16 November of that year he matriculated at the University of Louvain, where he acquired an MA degree which was incorporated at Cambridge in the following year. He then lectured in Hebrew at the trilingual college in Louvain between 1 August and 1 December 1519. In the same year or that following he became a fellow of Fisher's Cambridge foundation, St John's College, receiving a stipend there which was to continue until 1528. In 1520 or 1521 he was probably the &#145;Mr Wakefield&#146; who acted as a guarantor on behalf of Cambridge University for John Siberch's new Cambridge press.<br>
<br>Fisher granted Wakefield permission to go abroad again for the study of Hebrew. Probably during this period he taught in Paris and, while in Hagenau, he was invited to take up an appointment as lecturer in Hebrew at T&uuml;bingen, in succession to Johannes Reuchlin, the leading Christian Hebraist of his age; he did so in August 1522. Shortly afterwards he was known to Erasmus, who reported positively on his teaching to John Fisher. His lectures (at a salary of 104 florins per annum, which Erasmus thought generous, and including elementary Arabic and Aramaic as well) were so highly valued that the University of T&uuml;bingen wrote to Fisher, and Archduke Ferdinand of Austria wrote to Henry VIII, asking for the postponement of his return to Cambridge. This return took place, however, in 1523, when he was made Cambridge's first salaried lecturer in Hebrew, paid for by the king. By 1526&#150;7 he was receiving a half-yearly wage of 56<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. from the crown.<br>
<br>Wakefield delivered his famous inaugural oration at Cambridge entitled &#145;Oratio de laudibus &amp; utilitate trium linguarum Arabicae, Chaldaicae &amp; Hebraicae&#146; in April of 1524. The &#145;Oratio&#146; was printed, probably after extensive revision, in 1528 or early 1529, by Wynkyn de Worde, in the changed circumstances generated by Henry VIII's desire to annul his marriage to Katherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn. In 1527 Wakefield had been teaching Hebrew to Richard Pace in the Bridgettine house at Syon. From this period of study emerged both Pace's <span class="italic">Praefatio in Ecclesiasten recognitum ad Hebraicam veritatem</span> (1527?) and Wakefield's own <span class="italic">Paraphrasis in librum Koheleth</span> (1528?), a summary of the Hebrew text of <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>. It was at this time that Pace recommended Wakefield to the king, because of potential advantages which might accrue to the royal argument for the divorce from an examination of the Hebrew texts of scripture. In connection with the Henrician cause Wakefield had dealings with the royal servants Edward Foxe and John Stokesley, in whose home he stayed for some time, and also had an audience with the king. It must also be in the context of Henry VIII's &#145;great matter&#146; that, as he claims in the <span class="italic">Oratio</span>, Wakefield taught Hebrew to James Boleyn, Anne's uncle, and to Reginald Pole, who was sent to him for this purpose by Henry VIII.<br>
<br>All of this involved a fairly rapid change of allegiance for Wakefield, who, as the client of Bishop Fisher, Katherine of Aragon's leading intellectual advocate, had originally opposed Henry's case, later a matter of some embarrassment to Wakefield. The publication of the <span class="italic">Oratio</span> is therefore closely connected to the royal campaign to secure an annulment of the marriage. Its wide-ranging and uncompromising case for the superiority of Hebrew to the other ancient languages, and especially the value of Hebrew for Christian theologians, was particularly apt for the king at this moment, when Wakefield was using precisely these special linguistic skills&#151;rare as they were in the England of his time&#151;to argue the royal case against Fisher, which he did more exactly in a series of closely related treatises which were central to the debates on the divorce. Some of these are now lost; one in manuscript (BL, Cotton MS, Otho C x, fols. 184<i>r</i>&#150;198<i>r</i>) demonstrates Henry's reliance on the Hebrew version of scripture from the outset of his campaign in 1527, and introduces to the debate the important issue of whether the marriage of Henry's late brother, Arthur, to Katherine had been consummated; and two were published after much revision as part of the royal campaign at a latter stage in its development. <span class="italic">Kotser codicis</span>, which was printed by Thomas Berthelet in 1534, contains a dedicatory letter to Anne Boleyn's father, Thomas, and another letter justifying Wakefield's behaviour to Bishop Fisher, and was part of a larger treatise in favour of Henry's case. <span class="italic">Syntagma de Hebreorum codicum incorruptione</span> (printed by Wynkyn de Worde, also in 1534) contains, besides two other items, a defence of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> against the charge that the Jews had corrupted its text to reduce its Christological significance, and an untitled treatise on the divorce. In this work Wakefield's attitude to Fisher had noticeably hardened, and his tone towards his former patron is scornful. As a result of Wakefield's initiative in the divorce campaign, more Christian and Jewish Hebrew scholars from Venice were brought in on the king's side in 1530.<br>
<br>Despite brief remarks in his works on the value of learning Hebrew in order to dispute with Jews and convert them (not likely to be a persuasive justification for studying the language in a country which officially had no Jewish population), as well as on Jewish wickedness, and on the unreliability of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, Wakefield displays considerable reverence for Jewish writers of the middle ages, especially Abraham ibn Ezra, David Kimchi, Maimonides, Nachmanides, and Rashi. He also believed that the biblical Hebrews were the originators of every art and science which were often claimed for the ancient Greeks, and that Hebrew is God's own language. These positions make him sympathetic to Jewish experience in a period when Christian condemnations of Jews habitually crossed intellectual and ideological divides. Some of this stems from having absorbed, less critically than a number of his northern humanist contemporaries, the cabbalistic interests of such Renaissance figures as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Johannes Reuchlin, whose works he cites. More pronounced in Wakefield's writings, however, is the orthodox Christian humanist's and grammarian's case for Hebrew: no Christian theologian can reach an authentic comprehension of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> without studying it in its original language; and the same goes for the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, which contains many words derived from Hebrew. Christian scholastics, not Jews, are the most common objects of Wakefield's attacks, the church fathers his most frequent Christian allies; Lorenzo Valla's Greek philology is preferred over Pico's Hebrew scholarship which, according to Wakefield, was seriously flawed. In the <span class="italic">Oratio</span> there are related cases for doubting the divine authority of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> and <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> and for the value of studying Arabic and Aramaic. The latter leads him in turn to strong condemnation of Luther's linguistic and therefore exegetical abilities. Since Wakefield's treatise &#145;On faith and works&#146;&#151;if it was indeed by him&#151;is no longer extant, we must assume in the light of his criticism of Luther that he remained a Catholic, albeit one who came to accept the royal ecclesiastical supremacy.<br>
<br>Clearly not all of Wakefield's writings are available to us, and his private library can only be imagined. Although many of the works attributed to him by the contemporary bibliographer John Bale were in fact by Robertus Britannus of Arras, Bale does mention an &#145;Institutiones Hebraicas&#146; which is probably one of the Hebrew works which Wakefield, as he claims in the <span class="italic">Oratio</span>, hoped to publish when the printer developed more Hebrew type. In Archduke Ferdinand's letter to Henry VIII of 1523 it is stated that Wakefield took some of his works to be published to the Hagenau printing house of Thomas Anshelm. In the <span class="italic">Syntagma</span> Wakefield denounces Richard Collier, former Carthusian and vicar in Sittingbourne, for stealing from his home many rare Hebrew, Aramaic, Latin, Greek, and Arabic books, including his own &#145;Lexicon Chaldaicum&#146;, as well as the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, works by Avicenna, and Adam Easton's fourteenth-century Latin translation of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. According to John Leland, however, Wakefield himself pilfered from Ramsey Abbey a Hebrew dictionary which had been written by one of the abbey's early fifteenth-century monks, Laurence Holbeach. Wakefield was an admirer of the Hebrew printer Daniel Bomberg and probably owned some of his works. A number of Hebrew books belonging to his younger brother Thomas survive, and may have been given to him by Robert.<br>
<br>Wakefield's change of allegiance from Fisher and Katherine of Aragon to the king and Anne Boleyn had a major impact on his income and career. By the end of 1528 he was being paid a quarterly wage of 100<i>s</i>. by the treasurer of the king's chamber; in the following year he became regius praelector of Hebrew at Oxford at a salary of &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.&#151;his inaugural oration is printed in the <span class="italic">Syntagma</span>, together with a letter from Oxford University thanking the king for his appointment. On 18 July 1532 he was made a canon and prebendary of Henry VIII College, about three months after the incorporation at Oxford of his Cambridge bachelorship in theology. He complained, however, that for seven years his annual salary of &pound;20 had been denied him due to an unnamed enemy who has plausibly been identified as Edward Foxe, whom Wakefield believed to be envious of him; Thomas and Anne Boleyn seem to have helped him recover the money owing, which by about 1533 amounted to more than &pound;100.<br>
<br>Wakefield's students and admirers represent a diverse and influential group, including, by his own testimony, Thomas Hurskey, master of the Gilbertines, John Taylor, master of the rolls, John Stokesley, bishop of London, William Frisel, prior of the Rochester Cathedral chapter, William Tait, canon of Windsor and York, Thomas Lovell, canon of Bath and Wells, and Kaspar Amman, prior of the Augustinian house in Lauingen, Germany. We know from other evidence that he probably taught John Bale, the civil lawyer John Oliver, and the Li&egrave;ge humanist Paschasius Berselius. Through his teaching, publications, and influence with the king, he was the pioneering figure in the establishment of Hebrew study in Tudor England. One of the chief interests of Wakefield's life and writings is in demonstrating in a particularly well-documented fashion the opportunities offered to scholars and to new fields of scholarly endeavour by Henry VIII's divorce, as well as the intellectual conflicts, crises of loyalties, and ruptures of friendship and patronage this could engender.<br>
<br>In the final years of his life Wakefield seems to have gravitated away from Oxford, residing around 1534 in Moorgate. His will, naming his brother Thomas as his executor, was dated 8 October 1537 and was proved in London on 13 May of the following year. His place of burial is not known.<br>
