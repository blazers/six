<span class="headword">Gilbey,  Alfred Newman</span>  (1901&#150;1998), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born at Mark Hall, Latton, Harlow, Essex, on 13 July 1901, the fifth son and youngest among the seven children of Newman Gilbey and his Spanish wife, Maria Victorina de Ysasi. His paternal grandfather had founded a wine business and it is from the family associated with the Gilbeys in that enterprise that Alfred derived his second name. He was educated at the Jesuit Beaumont College, near Windsor (1914&#150;20), and Trinity College, Cambridge (1920&#150;24), where he read history. Having decided to become a priest, he was sent to the Beda College in Rome (1925&#150;9) and was ordained on 15 August 1929 at Mark Hall &#145;on his own patrimony&#146;, an arrangement then possible in the Roman Catholic church, whereby a priest could look for pastoral work in what diocese he chose, but no diocese had responsibility for his upkeep. In fact he was personal secretary to Bishop Arthur Doubleday of Brentwood from 1929 to 1932, before being appointed as chaplain to Catholic undergraduates at the University of Cambridge. This post, which has no official standing so far as the university is concerned, had been created by the Catholic bishops of England and Wales in 1895, the arrangement being special to Oxford and Cambridge. However the lack of endowment or any adequate funding for the chaplaincy meant that only a priest with a private income could be appointed. During all his years at Cambridge, Gilbey received no salary and paid most of the chaplaincy's running costs out of his own pocket.<br>
<br>In 1932 Gilbey thus began a period of pastoral work for which his gifts were particularly well suited. The warmth and vitality of his personality, inherited from his Spanish mother, gave a unique character to his hospitality. Lightly carried erudition marked his devotion to the history of Cambridge, its university and colleges. His sense of humour, wit, and elegance completed a personality which made its mark in Cambridge during the thirty-three academic years and one term when he was in residence. The sight of Gilbey in the streets of Cambridge, attired in frock coat and broad-brimmed ecclesiastical hat, remains a memory of that period. All this served the ministry of the priesthood, to which he gave his wholehearted service. He was remarkably successful in extending the chaplaincy's influence beyond the small group of Catholic students; although he never proselytized, he received as chaplain 170 members of the university into full communion with the Catholic church.<br>
<br>When students returned to Cambridge in large numbers after the Second World War, Gilbey resumed the tradition of an open house at the chaplaincy, and integrated into his flock students from state schools funded by grants from local authorities. However the material existence of Fisher House, the chaplaincy's buildings in Guildhall Street (formerly the Black Swan), was threatened from 1948 onwards by successive plans to develop the city centre. Gilbey led a long-drawn-out campaign to highlight the importance of Fisher House for the Catholic body in England; it was not until 1964 that the house and its curtilage were definitely left out of the Lion Yard scheme, which destroyed Petty Cury, the oldest street in Cambridge. Without Gilbey's persistence and influence Fisher House would probably also have vanished, to the great detriment of the chaplaincy's work.<br>
<br>Women students were not technically full members of the University of Cambridge until 1948; a separate chaplaincy for Catholic women students had been created which from 1937 operated at Lady Margaret House, whereas at Oxford the two chaplaincies had merged in 1941. Gilbey was no misogynist and had many women friends but, although he had the gifts to make an excellent chaplain to a mixed body of students, he preferred to maintain unchanged the arrangements that he had found when he became chaplain. Already in 1949 there had been requests among students for a mixed chaplaincy at Fisher House. By the 1960s opposition to the Cambridge situation was becoming more vocal and the board which represented the Catholic hierarchy in its relation to the Oxford and Cambridge chaplaincies received objections to the continuing segregation at Cambridge, both from Catholic senior members of the university and from students, the latter led to a considerable extent by young priests and graduate students from St Edmund's House. As a result Gilbey, who had announced his intention of retiring in the summer of 1966, brought the date forward to December 1965. It was seen as regrettable by many that someone who had done so much for the chaplaincy was not allowed to complete his term of office. The manner of his departure from Cambridge left a legacy of division to the small Catholic community. This was exacerbated by the way Fisher House was stripped of the furniture and memorabilia, which Gilbey had collected. It exemplified the damage done to many Catholic churches at the time through ill-considered attempts to implement the Second Vatican Council's decisions. Gilbey suffered keenly from what had happened, but he was exemplary in charity, treating those who opposed his policy with unfailing courtesy and consideration.<br>
<br>Gilbey went to live in London at the Travellers' Club, where he began a second apostolate as long and, in its own way, as effective as his first. He became the unofficial chaplain to former members of his Cambridge flock, their wives, children, and grandchildren. Cardinal Heenan had obtained permission from Rome for him to continue saying the Tridentine mass and, at a time of liturgical upheaval, he helped many to remain within the Catholic church. He also continued to instruct numerous would-be converts. His instructions were recorded by a friend and published as <span class="italic">We Believe, by a Priest</span> (1983), a book which enjoyed unexpectedly wide success. At a time when there was considerable confusion in catechetical programmes, Gilbey reaffirmed that to be a Catholic implies acceptance of the teaching authority of the church and illustrated that teaching with clarity and the resources of a well-stocked mind, including extensive quotations from the documents of the Second Vatican Council. He also distinguished between essential teaching and the vagaries of ecclesiastical policy in the application of the council, thus enabling many traditionally minded Catholics to remain within the church and to avoid the schism of Archbishop Lefebvre.<br>
<br>As the years passed, Gilbey became more and more of a cult figure for those who were fascinated by the manners and diction of a bygone age, and by his critique of contemporary society. The centre of his life continued to be the exercise of his priesthood. He celebrated mass daily at the Brompton Oratory, twice a month for his wider flock. At the Travellers' Club he had obtained the use of a small room at the top of the building for his private oratory, where he was able to reserve the blessed sacrament. There he would spend much time in prayer and sometimes say mass. There were many telephone calls for Mgr Gilbey, and the club porter, tired of walking from his lodge to the oratory, asked that there should be a telephone extension. The telephone was concealed under the altar, so that those who were invited to share Gilbey's orisons were sometimes surprised to see him dive behind the altar frontal in response to the telephone bell.<br>
<br>&#145;There is always time for the sacraments&#146; was a favourite phrase of Gilbey's  (Watkins, 76, 82), and he continued this ministry almost to the end of his life, grateful for having exercised for so long &#145;the sublime and aweful gift of the priesthood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fisher House Newsletter</span>, 1979, 15). Because of failing health, he moved from the club to the Poor Sisters of Nazareth, Hammersmith Road, Brook Green, a few days before his death, which occurred on 26 March 1998 at Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham. He was buried on 6 April in the courtyard of Fisher House at Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1950 Gilbey was made a prelate of honour, in 1964 a protonotary apostolic, and in 1981 an honorary canon of Brentwood Cathedral. He had been a chaplain of the order of Malta since 1947, and in 1982 was promoted to grand cross conventual chaplain <i>ad honorem</i>.<br>
