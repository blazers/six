<span class="headword">Williams,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Williams y Wern]</span>  (1781&#150;1840), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was the sixth child of William and Jane <i>n&eacute;e</i> Probert of Cwmhyswn-ganol in the parish of Llanfachraeth, Merioneth. His father was a small farmer and carpenter, and young William worked as a carpenter for several years. His interest in religion was prompted at the age of thirteen, when he heard &#145;Peg-Leg&#146; Rhys Dafis preach a sermon at Bedd-y-coedwr farm. At the age of fifteen he was admitted a member of the Pen-y-stryd Independent chapel. In his nineteenth year he began to preach in connection with Pen-y-stryd Chapel and received some lessons from his minister, the Revd William Jones, who taught him to write. Shortly afterwards, he went for nine months to a school at Aberhafesb, near Newtown, Montgomeryshire. In 1803 he was accepted as a student at the dissenting academy at Wrexham under Dr Jenkin Lewis, where he remained until 1807. While a student there he used to preach in the smaller villages of the district, and this led to an invitation to become the pastor of two inactive churches at Y Wern and Harwd (now known as Brymbo) in the parish of Wrexham. After a year's probation he was ordained on 28 October 1808.<br>
<br>Williams worked hard to strengthen his congregations and successfully formed, and for some years supervised, churches at Llangollen, Rhos, and Ruabon. Williams was one of the chief organizers of the General Welsh Union, formed in 1834 for the liquidation of chapel debts, and himself gave material assistance in many ways to the poorer churches of Flintshire and Denbighshire. Above all, he periodically made several preaching tours throughout Wales, becoming popularly and widely known as Williams y Wern or Williams o'r Wern. He was regarded as one of the greatest Welsh nonconformist preachers of the period. His vivid and imaginative style transformed the dry pulpit oratory of his own denomination. But Williams was not indifferent to doctrinal issues. Early in his career, he followed the example of John Roberts (1767&#150;1834), abandoning higher Calvinism in favour of a more moderate doctrine. His article published in the &#145;blue book&#146; of John Roberts (1820) caused a great deal of discussion at the time.<br>
<br>In 1836 Williams became pastor of the Welsh Tabernacle Church, Great Crosshall Street, Liverpool. He remained there for only three years, and returned to Y Wern with broken health in October 1839. Domestic tragedies contributed to his condition. His wife, Rebecca Griffiths of Chester, whom he had married on 22 July 1817, had died on 3 March 1836 (an event which probably led to his first removal from Y Wern to Liverpool). His eldest daughter died in February 1840, and Williams himself followed, dying at Y Wern on 17 March 1840. His eldest son, James, died in March 1841. All four were buried at Y Wern, where a memorial column, provided by public subscription, was erected in 1884. His two surviving children, a son and a daughter, emigrated to Australia.<br>
