<span class="headword">Stevenson,  Dorothy Emily</span>  (1892&#150;1974), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at 45 Melville Street, Edinburgh, on 18 November 1892, the elder of two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70296/', "David Alan Stevenson (1854&#150;1938)")</script>, a civil engineer, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts (<i>c</i>.1862&#150;1945). Her father belonged to a dynasty of civil engineers who specialized in the design of lighthouses, and his first cousin was Robert Louis Stevenson&#151;&#145;they often played together when they were boys&#146;  (autobiographical sketch). Her mother, the daughter of William Roberts, an East India merchant, was a first cousin of the military hero Frederick Sleigh Roberts, Baron Roberts of Kandahar.<br>
<br>Dorothy Stevenson and her sister were educated at home and by a governess. She began to write when she was eight: &#145;My head was full of stories and in the box-room between two large black trunks with a sky-light overhead I made a little nest where I would not be disturbed. There I sat for hours&#151;and wrote and wrote&#146;  (autobiographical sketch). But &#145;my parents were not encouraging&#146;  (&#145;The author's point of view&#146;) and her childhood was lonely: she and her sister used to sit on the window-seat in the nursery and look down at the people passing by and &#145;I told her stories about them&#146;  (autobiographical sketch). Summers were spent at North Berwick. &#145;We had bathing parties and tennis parties and fancy dress dances, and of course we played golf&#146;  (ibid.). (Later she was asked to play in the Scottish golf team but was not able to do so as she was by then married and expecting a baby.) Every spring the Stevensons, who were old-fashioned and strict in their ideas, took their two daughters travelling in Europe. Meanwhile Dorothy wanted an intellectual education to the extent of defying her parents' wishes, managing to sit and pass the entrance exams for the women's colleges at Oxford and being offered a place. However, her parents forbade her to go, deeming an education &#145;unsuitable for a woman&#146;  (Bevan, 381).<br>
<br>In 1913 Stevenson came out as a d&eacute;butante; but within a year the war had put an end to gaiety. By now the family had moved to 14 Eglinton Crescent and it was from here, on 20 January 1916, at St John's Church, Edinburgh, that she married James Reid Peploe (1887&#150;1969), a captain in the 6th Gurkha rifles, who was from another Edinburgh family; he was the son of James Reid Peploe, major in the 4th Highland light infantry, and was the nephew of the painter Samuel Peploe. At the start of the Peploes' marriage, &#145;the busiest time of my life &hellip; we moved about from place to place (as soldiers and their wives and families must do)&#146;  (autobiographical sketch), they established several different homes. Two sons and two daughters were born between 1916 and 1930; the eldest daughter died in 1928 when she was eleven. The family lived at Bearsden, Glasgow, while Major Peploe (as he now was) first commanded the university officer training corps and then was in charge of the Glasgow University athletics ground.<br>
<br>In 1915 and 1926 D. E. Stevenson (the name under which most of her works appeared) published two books of poetry; in 1929 came her novel <span class="italic">Peter West</span>. But her first success was in 1932 when, anonymously, she published <span class="italic">Mrs Tim of the Regiment</span>. This account of the life of an officer's wife grew out of her diary&#151;many of the incidents were true. Her fourth novel was the best-selling <span class="italic">Miss Buncle's Book</span> (1934), which had two sequels in 1936 and 1943. It was about an unmarried woman writing a novel about her village under the pseudonym John Smith, and the villagers gradually realizing that they have a viper in their midst: &#145;It is the truthful depiction of people, and the exposure of their faults, that makes Barbara Buncle's writing dangerous&#146;  (Bevan, 377). D. E. Stevenson, &#145;a quiet woman with blue eyes and a low-pitched, unforgettable voice&#146;  (Templeton, viii), wrote ten novels altogether during the 1930s. Her daughter Rosemary remembered &#145;her writing constantly every single day, lying with her legs up on the sofa, and a board on her lap to lean on, smoking endless cigarettes in a very long cigarette holder&#146;  (ibid., 376). Then came the eight wartime books in which she &#145;pictured everyday life in Britain during the war and tried to show how ordinary people stood up to the frightfulness and what they thought and did during those awful years of anxiety&#146;  (autobiographical sketch). One of her sons won the MC and her daughter, an officer in the WRNS, was commended for her work; D. E. Stevenson herself organized the collection of sphagnum moss for the Red Cross (it was then sent away to be cleaned and used as medical dressings).<br>
<br>In 1943, after the Glasgow docks were bombed, the Peploes moved to North Park, Well Road, Moffat, Dumfriesshire. D. E. Stevenson continued to publish a novel a year, each one about, as she put it, &#145;people everyone would like to meet&#146;  (Templeton, xii). She travelled away from home only rarely and &#145;was content with the life of an ordinary, well-to-do middle-class woman in a Scottish country town with the gentle entertainments of tea parties with neighbours, drives in the beautiful Borders countryside, her crossword puzzles and her voracious reading&#146;  (viii) and her novels, which continued to be &#145;noted for their smoothly flowing style and for the warmth and friendliness of the many characters represented&#146;  (Sir William Collins in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Jan 1974).<br>
<br>Stevenson's books were translated into six European languages. During the 1960s more than twenty of her novels were reissued as Fontana paperbacks and in this edition alone &#145;they sold 250,000 copies a year&#146;  (<span class="italic">Books and Bookmen</span>, Feb 1970, 15); &#145;more than four million copies of her novels have been sold in Great Britain and three million in America&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Jan 1974). In her later years D. E. Stevenson, &#145;a lovely person, with white hair parted on one side, very neat and dressed in tweeds&#146;  (Hogg), suffered from severe osteoarthritis. Her husband died on 12 April 1969. She died in Moffat on 30 December 1973 from bronchopneumonia, perforation of the small intestine, and diverticulitis, and was buried in the cemetery above Moffat on 3 January 1974.<br>
