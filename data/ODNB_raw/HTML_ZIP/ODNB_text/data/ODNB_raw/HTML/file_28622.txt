<span class="headword">Walsingham, Sir  Edmund</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1480, <em>d.</em> 1550), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the eldest son of James Walsingham (1462&#150;1540), landowner, of Scadbury, in Chislehurst, Kent, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>b</i>. before 1465, <i>d</i>. after 1540), daughter of Walter Writtle of Bobbingworth, Essex. His pedigree traces family ancestors to thirteenth-century Walsingham, Norfolk, but his earliest documented forebears were London citizens: Alan Walsingham (<i>fl</i>. 1415), a cordwainer; Thomas Walsingham (<i>d</i>. 1457), a vintner, who bought Scadbury in 1424; and Thomas Walsingham (1436&#150;1467), his grandfather. Edmund Walsingham's brother William (<i>d</i>. 1534), was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28624/', "Sir Francis Walsingham (c.1532&#150;1590)")</script>.<br>
<br>Walsingham inherited Scadbury only in 1541 and was not a JP in Kent until 1547. Earlier he became involved in Surrey politics, marrying Katherine (<i>b</i>. before 1495, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1526), daughter of John Gunter of Chilworth, and widow of Henry Morgan of Pen-coed, Monmouthshire, by 1510, and entering service with Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, by 1513. The couple had four sons, including Sir Thomas Walsingham (1526&#150;1584), father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28628/', "Sir Thomas Walsingham (1560/61&#150;1630)")</script>, and four daughters. In 1513, outside Guildford, Walsingham, John Westbroke, and John Shirley (all Howard men) &#145;mayhaymed&#146; Nicholas Eliot of Shalford, cut off his ears, and so abused his wife that &#145;what with fear and with the hurt she had than she was seke [sick] many a daye&#146;  (TNA: PRO, STAC 2/26/355). Cardinal Thomas Wolsey's investigation of Surrey corruption in 1519 revealed that when Sir William Fitzwilliam informed the earl of Surrey, the three assailants agreed to pay Eliot 20 nobles but probably reneged. Walsingham fought at Flodden on 9 September 1513, and Surrey knighted him four days later. After Henry VIII created Surrey second duke of Norfolk in 1514, Walsingham became a Surrey JP, but only briefly (perhaps owing to fluctuating Howard fortunes locally). He was frequently a subsidy commissioner for Surrey from 1523 until 1545, when he was elected knight of the shire with Sir Anthony Browne, and a muster commissioner in 1544. He also served on other commissions in Essex, Kent, London, and Surrey.<br>
<br>Walsingham accompanied Henry to meetings with Fran&ccedil;ois I at the Field of Cloth of Gold and Charles V at Gravelines in 1520, and when the emperor visited England in 1522. In 1521 he served on the jury at the treason trial of Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, became a sewer in the royal household, was made a freeman of the London Mercers' Company, and gained appointment as lieutenant of the Tower of London. Though the constable held higher rank, the lieutenant was actually in charge of prisoners. Walsingham resided there with an annual salary of &pound;100 and collected lucrative fees from inmates, for example &pound;14 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. a month for Arthur Plantagenet, sixth Viscount Lisle. The king rebuilt his house in 1539 at a cost of &pound;66 and prisoners exited the Belfry through it.<br>
<br>Walsingham had many famous prisoners, including Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard. Some complained of their treatment, including John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, Margaret Pole, countess of Salisbury, and Agnes Howard, duchess of Norfolk. However, Walsingham allowed Anne Tankerfelde such liberty that she escaped temporarily. He was kind to Curtoyse, the chaplain of Sir Thomas Cromwell, the principal secretary; to the protestant John Frith, of whom he wrote, &#145;it were a pity to lose him if he may be reconciled&#146;  (Webb, Miller, and Beckwith, 123); and to Sir Thomas More, who joked upon ascending the executioner's scaffold, &#145;I pray you, Master Lieutenant, see me safe up and, for my coming down, let me shift for myself&#146;  (Roper, 254). Besides executions, Walsingham supervised torture, but the story that he refused the command of Thomas Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley, the lord chancellor, to continue racking Anne Askew is erroneous (it was his successor, Sir Anthony Knyvet). Walsingham relinquished his position in 1543 and became vice-chamberlain of Katherine Parr's household in 1544. She perhaps helped him win election to parliament as MP for Surrey in 1545.<br>
<br>Walsingham acquired a substantial estate including St Paul's Cray, Swanton Court, West Peckham, and Yokes in Kent; Gomshall Towerhill in Surrey, which he sold in 1549 for &pound;600; nine houses in London (in 1539); and various leases. Katherine Walsingham died about 1526. Between 1535 and 1543 Walsingham married Anne Drury (<i>d</i>. 1559), daughter of Sir Edward Jerningham of Somerleyton, Suffolk, and his wife, Margaret Bedingfield (<i>d</i>. 1504). She had been widowed four times. The couple had no children. Walsingham died on 10 February 1550. His will was dated 8 February and requested burial at Chislehurst &#145;within the chapell there, where myself have usually sitten&#146;  (Webb, Miller, and Beckwith, 378). Most of his estate went to his heir, Thomas. His widow received &pound;40, much jewellery and plate, and his property at Yokes, and returned the lease on a house in Blackfriars which she had brought to the marriage. Walsingham left a further &pound;29 13<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in bequests, &pound;12 18<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in annuities, and additional leases and goods. His widow lived latterly as Lady Anne Grey and was buried on 6 April 1559 beside her first husband, Sir Edward Grey (<i>d</i>. 1517), at St Clement Danes, Westminster. In 1581 Thomas erected a monument, above which hang Walsingham's helmet and sword.<br>
