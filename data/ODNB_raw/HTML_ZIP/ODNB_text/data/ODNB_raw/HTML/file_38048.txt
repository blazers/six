<span class="headword">Talbot,  John</span>, sixteenth earl of Shrewsbury and sixteenth earl of Waterford  (1791&#150;1852), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic layman and patron of the Gothic revival</span>, was born at Grafton Manor, Bromsgrove, on 18 March 1791, the eldest surviving child of John Joseph Talbot (1765&#150;1815), who was the brother of Charles, the fifteenth earl of Shrewsbury, and his wife, Catherine (1768&#150;1791), daughter of Thomas Clifton of Lytham, Lancashire. His mother died two months after his birth and on his father's remarriage he was entrusted to the care of his great-aunt, the dowager countess of Shrewsbury, at Lacock Abbey, Wiltshire. Born in the same year as the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> was passed, Talbot was one of the first sons of the Catholic nobility to benefit from a Catholic education in Britain, being sent first to the Benedictines at Vernon Hall, Lancashire (the forerunner of Ampleforth College), then in 1802 to Stonyhurst, and finally in 1806 to St Edmund's College, near Ware. In 1812 he made a Mediterranean tour, accompanied by the Revd John Chetwode Eustace, and in Spain witnessed some of the action of the Peninsular War. In 1814 he married Maria Theresa (1794&#150;1856), eldest daughter of William Talbot of Castle Talbot, co. Wexford; they had a son who died in infancy and two daughters.<br>
<br>In June 1827 Talbot succeeded to the earldom and estates of his uncle Charles. The Talbots were one of the oldest Catholic families in Britain, who had managed to retain most of their estates. They were the most important landowners in the midlands. The principal family seat at Heythrop, Oxfordshire, was burnt down in 1831, and the new earl took up residence at Alton Abbey, Staffordshire, a Gothic mansion erected by his predecessor. Reluctant to pursue the political career that was open to him following the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Act</span> of 1829, he set about the realization at Alton of a Gothic dream, made possible by the artistic genius of A. W. Pugin, who had converted to Catholicism shortly after meeting him. Between 1839 and 1851 Pugin completed the mansion, now renamed Alton Towers, and built Alton Castle with its neo-medieval church, school, almshouse, and hospital, thereby embodying the spiritual ideals that Talbot shared with his close friend and collaborator Ambrose Phillipps De Lisle.<br>
<br>Shrewsbury sponsored the building of many of the churches designed by Pugin, notably that of St Giles's, Cheadle, Staffordshire, and provided financial support for De Lisle's schemes for the reconversion of England. However, he took a far more realistic approach to the revival, and did not share De Lisle's conviction that the Oxford Movement would lead to the reunion of the Church of England with the Roman Catholic church. Although regarded by the leaders of the Catholic revival as their patron, &#145;the Good Earl John&#146; (as he was known by them) retained something of the old Catholic suspicion of &#145;enthusiasm&#146;. When the English Catholic hierarchy was restored in 1850, Shrewsbury defended the restoration in public and denounced the Catholic peers who distanced themselves from it; but he nevertheless felt that the triumphalism of Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman was imprudent and ill-advised. Politically he was a whig who nevertheless supported the union, and was distressed to find himself at odds with some of his fellow Catholics over Ireland. He deplored the support given to Daniel O'Connell by the Catholic periodical <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>.<br>
<br>By 1850 the earl was spending most of his time in Italy, closing Alton Towers for most of the year in order to save money for his schemes. In all, he is estimated to have spent some &pound;500,000 on churches and charities. He died at Naples on 9 November 1852. His remains were taken to Alton, where his funeral on 14 December was the occasion for a solemn ritual worthy of its setting, and was attended by virtually all the leading Catholic churchmen and laity. Pugin died two months before his patron, in September 1852. Both Shrewsbury's daughters married Roman noblemen. The younger, Gwendalyn, Princess Borghese, died in 1840 at the age of twenty-two while ministering to the victims of an epidemic at Rome. The elder, Mary, born in 1815, married Prince Doria Pamphilij. Shrewsbury's will was the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between the family and the executors, Charles Scott Murray and Ambrose Phillipps De Lisle. He was succeeded by his cousin Bertram Arthur Talbot (1832&#150;1856). On the death of the latter at the age of twenty-four the title passed out of Catholic hands and devolved upon Henry John Chetwynd, third Earl Talbot of Hensol.<br>
