<span class="headword">Weekley,  Ernest</span>  (1865&#150;1954), <span class="occ">linguist and writer</span>, was born on 27 April 1865 at New End, Hampstead, London, the second of the nine children of Charles Weekley (<i>b</i>. 1834), a relieving officer for the Hampstead board of guardians, and Agnes (<i>b</i>. 1840), daughter of George McCowen, a schoolmaster and parish clerk of Uxbridge.<br>
<br>Weekley began his education at Dane Hill House, Margate, Kent, a private boarding-school run by the Revd Alfred Boulden, a cousin of his father. He achieved a number of spectacular results in the local examinations conducted by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and left at seventeen to take up schoolmastering at Colchester. This apprenticeship was brief, however, and he soon returned to become a member of Dane Hill's teaching staff, using his scanty leisure and school holidays for intensive study. His true bent was always towards languages and philology, but he also did well at mathematics, and was able to offer it among the group of subjects in which he passed the examination for the ordinary bachelor of arts degree of University College, London.<br>
<br>In 1892, following a year at the University of Bern, where he learned to speak German fluently, Weekley obtained a London master of arts degree in French and German, and so created the prospect of a Cambridge career. This began when William Briggs, founder of the University Tutorial Correspondence College, based at Cambridge, offered him a part-time post on his staff. The arrangement enabled Weekley to combine his work for Briggs with reading for the medieval and modern languages tripos as a student of Trinity College from the autumn of 1893. In 1896 he secured a major scholarship at this college and obtained a brilliant first-class degree, with special distinctions in French and German, and a notation indicating proficiency in the pronunciation of modern German.<br>
<br>Weekley spent the next year in Paris, and the one following in Germany, at Freiburg im Breisgau. He attended the lectures of Gaston Paris (1839&#150;1903) at the Sorbonne, narrowly supporting himself by writing one of his series of French textbooks for Briggs and by private tutoring. At Freiburg he held the university post of <i>Lektor</i> in English, devoting his free time to studying under Friedrich Kluge (1856&#150;1926), author of the monumental <span class="italic">Etymologisches W&ouml;rterbuch der deutschen Sprache</span>.<br>
<br>In 1898 Weekley was appointed professor of French and head of the modern languages department at University College, Nottingham. When in Freiburg he had met and fallen in love with Emma Maria Frieda Johanna, Baroness von Richthofen (1879&#150;1956), second daughter of Baron Friedrich von Richthofen (1846&#150;1915), a Silesian-born engineer, and they were married in that city on 29 August 1899. They would have three children: Montague Karl Richthofen (Monty), born on 12 June 1900; Elsa Agnes Frieda, born on 13 September 1902; and Barbara Joy (Barby), born on 20 October 1904. The Weekleys made their home at 9 Goldswong Terrace, Nottingham, where Ernest's university lecturing frequently kept him away from his wife and growing family. The latter necessitated a move in 1904 to a larger house, at 8 Vickers Street, and in 1910 to an even bigger one, Cowley, in Victoria Crescent.<br>
<br>It was at Cowley on 3 March 1912, at a time when Weekley was preoccupied with the publication of his first popular book on etymology, <span class="italic">The Romance of Words</span> (1912), that Frieda first met the budding novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34435/', "D. H. Lawrence (1885&#150;1930)")</script>, a former French student of Weekley's, who had come to discuss a possible job as a lecturer in Germany. The acquaintanceship rapidly developed into a passionate affair, and a mere eight weeks later the two eloped to Frieda's parents' home in Metz, eastern France. Frieda took her two daughters with her as far as London and left them with Weekley's parents at their house in Hampstead. Montague remained with his father at Cowley.<br>
<br>Weekley was devastated, but despite writing incessantly to Frieda, and even hiring detectives to trace her movements when she and Lawrence moved on to Mayrhofen, near Innsbruck in Austria, he was unable to persuade her to return. His parents insisted that he and Montague come to live with them as well. Their arrival meant that the Hampstead house was now home to nine: Ernest's parents, Ernest himself, his three children, his two sisters, Kit and Maude, and his bachelor brother, George. The number was too great for comfort, and in September 1912 the combined families moved to a larger house at 49 Harvard Road, Chiswick, Middlesex, conveniently close to St Paul's School, which Montague would soon attend. (The girls went to a local dame-school before entering St Paul's Girls' School.) Having initially denied Frieda the right to visit her children, on 11 February 1913 Weekley filed a petition for divorce on the grounds of adultery. That summer Frieda and Lawrence were back in England and managed a secret meeting with the children on 1 July in London. The divorce became absolute on 27 April 1914, and on 13 July that year Frieda and Lawrence were married at Kensington register office, London.<br>
<br>Having sold Cowley to a surgeon, Weekley now commuted every week between London and Nottingham, spending his nights in the latter city at 30 Clarendon Street, a bedsit near the college. Frieda visited him there in November 1914 with the aim of obtaining access to the children, but was met with a refusal and verbal abuse. He relented, however, after consulting his London solicitor, and Frieda and her offspring were officially reunited for half an hour at the solicitor's office on 11 August 1915. She was soon allowed to see them more regularly, subject to Ernest's approval. His sole provision was that Lawrence should not be with her.<br>
<br>Weekley continued to write and research, and he is best remembered for his popular books on words and names, almost all published by John Murray. <span class="italic">The Romance of Words</span> was the most successful, running into four editions. A further edition, with an introduction by Ivor Brown, appeared posthumously in 1961. The more substantial <span class="italic">An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English</span> (1921), with its succinct origins, wide-ranging citations, and diverting discursions, also did well. An American edition in two volumes, published in 1967, was still in print thirty years later. <span class="italic">A Concise Etymological Dictionary of Modern English</span>, also published in 1921, was issued in a revised edition in 1953. Other titles, no less interesting and informative, included <span class="italic">The Romance of Names</span> (1914), <span class="italic">Words Ancient and Modern</span> (1926), <span class="italic">The English Language</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Adjectives and other Words</span> (1930, a selection of past articles and lectures), and <span class="italic">Jack and Jill: a Study in our Christian Names</span> (1939). A curiosity is <span class="italic">Saxo Grammaticus, or, First Aid for the Best-Seller</span> (1930), published by Kegan Paul Trench Trubner in their <span class="roman">To-day and To-morrow</span> series, in which each author assumed the name of an appropriate mythological or historical character. (Saxo Grammaticus was a twelfth-century Danish historian.) This slim volume is devoted to &#145;the linguistic absurdities perpetrated by contemporary authors&#146;, and is essentially a critique, with many examples, of the various errors and infelicities rife in contemporary English writing, in the spirit of Fowler's <span class="italic">Modern English Usage</span> (1926). The tone is sometimes tetchy, but sensible guidance is offered to the would-be writer in the contentious matter of split infinitives and other solecisms.<br>
<br>Weekley's regular home remained that of his parents in Chiswick until 1938, when the house was compulsorily demolished to make way for a new road to the airport. Weekley was thus obliged to make another move, although this time without the children, who were now grown up and with families of their own. He rented a house in Richmond, Surrey, but it was bombed in the autumn of 1940, and he spent the rest of the war years at Cricieth, Caernarvonshire, renting a flat near old friends who had a holiday residence there. After the war, Weekley finally settled at 446 Upper Richmond Road, Putney, London, the home of his elder daughter, Elsa, her naval officer husband, Bernal Edward (Teddy) de Martelly Seaman, and their two boys, Geoffrey and Richard.<br>
<br>In 1952 Frieda paid a last visit to England to see her children and their families, but could not be invited to Elsa's home because of Ernest's presence there. She wished to see the garden, however, and Elsa deputed Teddy to show her the flowers from a distance. As they drove past, Frieda spotted the back of Ernest's head through the window of his study. Now nearly blind, he sat at his desk, apparently peering at a book. She was moved enough to propose a meeting, if the children approved, but Elsa and Montague rejected the offer, without mentioning it to Barbara, who later recalled her disappointment on learning of the incident.<br>
<br>Within three days of taking to his bed at his home in Putney, Weekley died of lung cancer in his ninetieth year on 7 May 1954. The character of the Revd Arthur Saywell, a country parson in Lawrence's <span class="italic">The Virgin and the Gypsy</span> (1930), is based on Weekley, as in part at least is John Beavis, a sarcastic sociologist in Aldous Huxley's <span class="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</span> (1936).<br>
