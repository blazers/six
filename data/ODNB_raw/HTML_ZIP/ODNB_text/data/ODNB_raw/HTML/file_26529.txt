<span class="headword">Stirling,  Charles</span>  (1760&#150;1833), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26536/', "Captain Sir Walter Stirling RN (1718&#150;1786)")</script> and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of Charles Willing of Philadelphia, was born on 28 April 1760. Having entered the navy, he was promoted lieutenant in June 1778 and served in that rank under Sir Edward Hughes in the East Indies. He was promoted commander in May 1780 and then on 15 January 1783 was promoted captain for having in the <i>Savage</i> (14 guns, 125 crew) fought the American privateer <i>Congress</i> (20 guns, 215 crew) on 6 September 1781; he had refused to surrender until his mizzen-mast had been brought down and his mainmast nearly so. He was subsequently appointed to the <i>Unicorn</i> (20 guns), serving in the West Indies, and, at the beginning of the French Revolutionary War, to the frigate <i>Venus</i>.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1795 Stirling commanded the 44-gun <i>Jason</i> with the expedition of Sir John Borlase Warren to Quiberon Bay; in 1797 was active with a squadron attacking French shipping off the mouths of the rivers Sable d'Olonne and Garonne; and on 26 June 1798, in company with the <i>Pique</i> and <i>Mermaid</i>, after a chase of sixteen hours, captured the 42-gun French frigate <i>La Seine</i>. On 11 October 1798 the <i>Jason</i> was wrecked while chasing a French squadron near Brest but, after an exchange of prisoners, Stirling was appointed to the 80-gun <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i>, which was damaged in the battle of Algeciras on 6 July 1801, and then employed in the blockade of Cadiz.<br>
<br>From the renewal of hostilities until April 1804 Stirling was resident naval commissioner at Jamaica. In 1805, in the 98-gun <i>Glory</i>, he had command of the Rochefort squadron, before being dispatched to reinforce Sir Robert Calder, with whom he took part on 22 July in the action of Cape Finisterre which resulted in the capture of two Spanish line-of-battle ships. Stirling was promoted rear-admiral on 9 November 1805 and in the autumn of 1806 commanded the squadron that conveyed troops under Sir Samuel Auchmuty to the River Plate, where he co-operated with them in their siege of Montevideo, before becoming commander-in-chief at the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>Promoted vice-admiral on 31 July 1810, Stirling was transferred to command on the Jamaica station the following year. However, he was recalled in 1813 to face a charge at court martial of taking a bribe of $2000 for providing a convoy escort to a merchant schooner. In May 1814 the court found the charge partly proved and Stirling was sentenced to remain on the half-pay list without any further promotion. He married Charlotte, second daughter of Andrew Grote, a banker in London, and was elected a member of the Royal Society. He died at his home, Woburn Farm, Weybridge, Surrey, on 7 November 1833.<br>
