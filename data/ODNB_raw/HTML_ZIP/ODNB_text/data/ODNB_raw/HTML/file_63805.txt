<span class="headword">Cook,  Henry Caldwell</span>  (1886&#150;1939), <span class="occ">schoolteacher and educationist</span>, was born on 20 May 1886 at 1 The Elms, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, the fourth son of William Cook, merchant, and his wife, Jessie Euphrasia (formerly Caldwell). His father had considerable business interests in Argentina, and following the family's move to London Cook was educated at a preparatory school in St John's Wood, then as a boarder at Highgate School before entering Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1905. He took second-class honours in English language and literature in 1909, followed by the Oxford diploma in education, with distinction, in 1911. That year he approached Dr W. H. D. Rouse, headmaster of the Perse School, Cambridge, for employment (without salary), as the school's innovative methods interested him. There he remained as a form master and teacher of English for the whole of his teaching career. From 1915 he saw active service in the Artists' Rifles in France, and Rouse later noted that the war left its mark on him  (Beacock, <span class="italic">Play Way English</span>, v).<br>
<br>In his early years at the Perse School, Cook encouraged boys in acting, public speaking, and writing their own plays. These were published as the <span class="roman">Perse playbooks</span> (nos. 1&#150;5, 1912&#150;15; no. 6, 1921). His teaching methods attracted national attention at a time when similar innovations entailing spontaneous creative work by pupils and a renunciation of the teacher's traditional authoritarianism were being promoted by a number of prominent educationists. Largely at his own expense he established the &#145;Mummery&#146;, a permanent theatrical space in the school, and his curriculum centred on creative performance of Shakespeare. In 1917 he published <span class="italic">The Play Way, an Essay in Educational Method</span>, widely read and reprinted many times, in which he gave colourful descriptions, embellished by drawings and photographs, of his young secondary-school pupils indulging their imaginations, making plays, writing ballads, and lecturing on their interests and hobbies. Its challenge to traditional formality was sharpened by disillusionment with world war on his own part and on the part of many of his readers. Its title, much misunderstood, became mistakenly synonymous with progressive education in general. The distinctive and sometimes idiosyncratic details of his approach were principally applied, however, in the teaching of English language and literature, and it is in this area of the curriculum that his writings have had long-lasting impact.<br>
<br>Broadly, Cook's educational principles were that effective learning comes not from reading and listening but from action and experience, and that good work is more often the result of spontaneous effort and free interest than of compulsion. Play was observed to be the natural means of study for children: &#145;By Play I mean the <i>doing</i> of anything one <i>knows</i> with one's heart in it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Play Way</span>, 17). He hoped to persuade his pupils that their education was a journey of their choice, on which they travelled at their own pace. Only by their own efforts could they attain that perfection of inherent ability which is the true end of education. His belief in the value for civilization of artistic practice was influential and corresponded with the ideas of other contemporary innovators. His emphasis on play and creativity may be related to earlier psychological investigations by Karl Groos and G. Stanley Hall, and to artist educators such as Franz Ci&#382;ek and Emil Jacques-Dalcroze, who recognized the seriousness of children's creative activity and the quality of their art. He encouraged folk-dancing at school, with the support of his friend Cecil Sharp. His engagement in open-air activities such as swimming, camping, and scouting was shared by other innovative colleagues at the Perse School.<br>
<br>Following the publication of <span class="italic">The Play Way</span> Cook's work was celebrated and the school was much visited. Notable pupils were Humphrey Jennings, Spike Hughes, F. R. Leavis, and Marius Goring. Jennings and Hughes each published several poems in <span class="italic">Perse Playbook</span> no. 6 (1921), and both Hughes and Goring publicly recorded their debt to Cook. His teaching methods were resurrected at the Perse School from 1941, to the influence of which the director Sir Peter Hall testified, and the school was prominent in the revival of education through drama in the 1960s.<br>
<br>Cook was remembered as immensely tall, always clad in a Norfolk jacket and light-coloured knickerbockers, made of home spun. Their clean and wholesome smell was lightened with a whiff of scent, quite in keeping with the fastidious neatness of his wavy greying hair. One former pupil thought that he &#145;might have been drawn by Aubrey Beardsley&#146;. Some saw him &#145;impeccably dressed and civilized in speech and behaviour, as the epitome of the gentleman we aspired to become&#146;, though others reacted more negatively to &#145;his mode of dress and rather precious manner&#146;  (Perse School Archive MSS). He remained a bachelor, always quiet, retiring, and somewhat hard to know. The evidently homosexual aspects of his personality have been considered only by later commentators, and must be understood in the context of public school life and contemporary cults of sensibility. During his career at the Perse he had rooms in the house of a teacher colleague, R. B. Appleton, and they lie in adjacent unmarked graves. After Rouse's retirement a new regime at the school was hostile to Cook's methods. Consequent stress led in 1931 to a nervous breakdown, and in 1933 he retired. He lived an increasingly reclusive life in Cambridge, where he died at the Devonshire Nursing Home, 97 Tenison Road, of pneumonia, heart failure, and acute alcohol poisoning on 21 May 1939. He was buried on 24 May in the borough cemetery, Newmarket Road, Cambridge. The contribution of alcohol to his death was disputed by Rouse, who insisted that he had died of a broken heart  (Mitchell, 166).<br>
