<span class="headword">Waldegrave, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1338&#150;1410), <span class="occ">courtier and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the son of Sir Richard Waldegrave of Brant Broughton, Lincolnshire, who was knight of the shire for Lincolnshire in 1335, and died late in 1339. A minor at his father's death, the younger Richard Waldegrave eventually succeeded to the Lincolnshire estates and to family lands at Walgrave, Northamptonshire. About 1363 he secured further lands, and entry into Suffolk society, by marrying Joan, widow of Sir Robert Bures, who brought him substantial estates in Suffolk, Essex, and other counties. Joan's daughter by her first marriage was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107341/', "Alice Bryene")</script>, who later became a prominent landowner. As a young man Waldegrave served in the household of William and Humphrey (IX) de Bohun, successive earls of Northampton, and during the 1360s he fought in France, Italy, and Prussia under Bohun leadership; in 1365 he was knighted during a campaign against the Turks. His association with the Bohuns led to his forming friendships which would be important in his later political career. Waldegrave first represented Suffolk in the Commons in 1376, and was to sit in parliament on a further eleven occasions between then and 1390. In 1377 he became a knight of the king's household, where Guy, Lord Brian, a former associate of the Bohuns, was the newly appointed chamberlain. During the next fifteen years Waldegrave retained political influence partly through his links to other men who had been connected with the Bohuns, supporters both of Richard II and his opponents.<br>
<br>In June 1381 Waldegrave's life and property came under threat in Suffolk following the outbreak of the peasants' revolt. He may have been targeted due to his appointment to a commission investigating poll tax evasions in that county four months earlier. This experience probably influenced his term as speaker of the Commons after his election to that office in November 1381. On 18 November, when the house was divided over rescinding earlier royal concessions to the rebels, Waldegrave asked to be excused from the speakership. When his request was refused he demanded a repudiation of the Commons' &#145;charge&#146; for the session, and spoke perceptively of the causes of the rising. Waldegrave's attempted resignation may have been due to a reluctance to voice the Commons' criticisms of the administration; certainly his analysis of the origins of the rising drew attention to the faults of the royal household, and also emphasized the obstruction of justice in the furtherance of their disputes by magnates and gentry.<br>
<br>In the politically turbulent 1380s and 1390s Waldegrave became increasingly closely attached to the court, and he accompanied Richard II on his Scottish campaign of 1385, though he also continued to maintain links with some of the king's opponents. His appointment to the royal council in 1393 marked the high point of his association with Richard II. But the king's actions against his former opponents during the first session of the parliament of 1397&#150;8 led to Waldegrave's distancing himself from the royal cause, and in November 1397 he left the king's council, after obtaining a general pardon and letters of exemption from service in royal office. His departure from the council proved timely; unlike Richard II's more infamous councillors Waldegrave was to retain influence after their master was deposed in 1399, though after 1400 he was less active in government. The contrast between his 1404 confirmation of exemption from office, and the grant of this privilege in 1397, illustrates Waldegrave's altered fortunes, for the later confirmation represented essentially a peaceable and self-imposed withdrawal from government, due to old age. Waldegrave died on 2 May 1410 and was buried later that month in the parish church of Bures St Mary, Suffolk. He was survived by a son.<br>
