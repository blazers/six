<span class="headword">Howe,  Francis Richard Henry Penn Curzon</span>, fifth Earl Howe  (1884&#150;1964), <span class="occ">politician and motorist</span>, was born at Penn, Buckinghamshire, on 1 May 1884, the only son of Richard George Penn Curzon Howe, fourth Earl Howe (1861&#150;1929), MP for the High Wycombe division of Buckinghamshire from 1885 until 1900 when he succeeded to the earldom, and his wife, Lady Georgiana Elizabeth Spencer-Churchill (<i>d</i>. 1906), fifth daughter of the seventh duke of Marlborough. He was styled Viscount Curzon from 1900 until he succeeded his father as fifth Earl Howe in January 1929. His earliest ambitions pointed to a career in the navy, but on the grounds of poor health he was sent instead to Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. However, in 1904 he joined the Sussex division of the RNVR. He married on 28 October 1907 his cousin Mary (1887&#150;1962), only daughter of Colonel Montagu Curzon, younger son of the first Earl Howe. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In the First World War Howe fought at Antwerp in 1914 as commander in the Howe battalion of the Royal Naval Division and subsequently served as a gunnery officer on the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>. In 1918, finding the peacetime navy an unappealing prospect, Howe turned to politics. Backed by the &#145;Coupon&#146; issued by Lloyd George's coalition, he stood as Conservative candidate in South Battersea. As Viscount Curzon, he was returned with 68 per cent of the vote, though successive elections rapidly whittled his majority down to 1100 in a straight fight with Labour in 1923. Initially he saw himself as a spokesman for his former shipmates who urged him on leaving ship to &#145;Tell the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty what we think of him&#151;tell him off&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 126, 18 March 1920, col. 2536). He also became prominent as a defender of the motorist whom he saw as persecuted by the police, harassed by legislation and unfairly taxed. He accused the petrol companies of profiteering and regularly attacked the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as a state-owned business with an interest in keeping prices high. (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 142, 26 May 1921, col. 300; 143, 13 June, col. 2).<br>
<br>In common with many inter-war MPs and peers Howe was reluctant to accept that the laws on motoring applied to him. Fortified by personal experience he protested that the driver often committed offences unknowingly, only to be charged before &#145;a court of so-called justice&#146; and convicted because &#145;The word of anybody is taken against him. A policeman might say anything he likes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 135, 10 Dec 1920, col. 2673&#150;4). He demanded the removal of the 20 mph speed limit, complained that too many police were employed to detect infringements of the <span class="roman">Motor Car Act</span> of 1903, and frequently asked how many convictions against MPs and their drivers had been secured under the act, thereby exposing himself to the challenge: &#145;How many convictions have been recorded against the hon. and gallant member who put the question?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 132, 27 July 1920, col. 1200).<br>
<br>Howe's contributions to debate were severely limited by his appointment as a junior whip in 1924, though on his elevation to the House of Lords in 1929 as Earl Howe, he resumed his defence of the motorist. His favourite targets were taxi drivers, whom he accused of causing congestion in London, and local authorities for selling building land along the new arterial roads which were themselves financed via the Road Fund and thus &#145;from the pockets of the motoring community&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Oct 1934, 2 Oct 1936). As late as 1945 he responded to reports that 44,307 people had been killed on the roads during wartime by insisting that the main cause of the casualties was &#145;the recklessness of pedestrians&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Nov 1945).<br>
<br>Howe's passion for motoring dated from 1898 when visiting France aged fourteen. However, between 1908 and 1924 alone he acquired twenty-one convictions for driving offences. When charged with driving at 32 mph in a 20 mph zone in 1924 he was unapologetic, explaining that &#145;the car had four wheel brakes and could pull up very quickly&#146;. The magistrate fined him &pound;20 and suspended his licence for six months  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 3 April 1924). Yet this proved no deterrent and Howe was fined so often for excessive speed that in 1928 an exasperated magistrate advised him to take up motor racing, which he did at the age of forty-four.<br>
<br>As an amateur racing driver Howe participated in the new Mountain Circuit at Brooklands which was &#145;so designed that exciting incidents were plentiful&#146;, driving a type 43 Bugatti of which he was very fond. In 1931 he and Tim Birkin won the Le Mans 24 hour race in an Alfa Romeo Mouza. He suffered seven accidents including one at Vickers Bridge Corner at Brooklands in 1937 when he was thrown from the car, breaking his wrist, several ribs, and his shoulder. &#145;I have been wondering whether this will be the end of my husband's racing career&#146;, Lady Howe told the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>. &#145;These terrific speeds terrify me, but I would never dream of asking him to give up. His heart is too much in it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, 19 May 1937). Two months later he was back on the track as an observer.<br>
<br>Howe had taken up motor sport in the last days of amateur drivers and was obliged to give way to the professional racing teams. However, his experience and enthusiasm enabled him to devote himself to the development of what was now established as a leading sport. He served as chairman of the British Road Federation, chairman of the Royal Automobile Club's competition committee, and president of the British Racing Drivers' Club from 1928 until his death. His ambition was to make Britain the centre of the motor racing world by promoting the construction of new superior speedway tracks.<br>
<br>In an era when divorce was still comparatively uncommon and court appearances in marital cases were disapproved of in upper-class circles, Lord Howe was unusual. His first marriage was dissolved in January 1937, and he married second, on 8 February 1937, Joyce Mary McLean Jack, daughter of Charles McLean Jack of Johannesburg, South Africa, with whom he had a daughter. He divorced her in July 1943 and married third, on 8 February 1944, Sybil Boyter Shafto (1905&#150;1999), former wife of Major Ernest Duncombe Shafto and daughter of Captain Francis Johnson, with whom also he had a daughter. He died at his home, Hatchits, at Penn in Buckinghamshire on 26 July 1964. A robust personality, Howe was a vocal parliamentarian and became an immensely popular figure in Britain's motor racing fraternity.<br>
