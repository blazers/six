<span class="headword">Edgar,  William</span>  (1790/91&#150;1869), <span class="occ">haberdasher</span>, was born at Kirk St Andrew, Cumberland, the son of a farmer. Nothing is known of his schooling, but it was said that Edgar came to London where he had a stall in St James's market, Westminster, under which he used to sleep at night. He then joined forces with George Swan (1777?&#150;1821), who had established his own haberdashery business at 10 Fore Street, in the City of London. Swan may have moved by 1814 to 20 Piccadilly, where Edgar became his manager in 1815 and a partner in 1818. Swan may have opened more than one shop, as a Sun Insurance policy in 1819 locates him as a haberdasher at 236 Piccadilly, where his stock (lace excepted) was valued at &pound;5000. By 1820 Swan and Edgar were at 10 Piccadilly, their stock (again excepting lace) now valued at &pound;6000 at no. 10, and at another &pound;1000 in an adjacent warehouse. Swan died at 10 Piccadilly in 1821.<br>
<br>Edgar continued to trade as Swan and Edgar, expanding his business. As 10 Piccadilly had earlier been the site of the Bull and Mouth public house, he kept the licence and was able to operate a restaurant in the store without having to confront the opposition of nearby hostelries. He married Frances Leyburn on 21 November 1822 and settled in a house at Kingston Hill, Surrey, where the couple raised six children. Of their three daughters, Margaret Maria Edgar (1828&#150;1884) married Sir Henry William Peek, first baronet; their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35449/', "Cuthbert Edgar Peek, second baronet (1855&#150;1901)")</script>, became a noted amateur astronomer and meteorologist. Of Edgar's three sons only William Schindler Edgar (<i>b</i>. 1824) and another son followed him into the firm. It is probable that the other children rose socially and considered haberdashery beneath them. Swan and Edgar was rather more than a mere haberdasher; it developed into the classic London department store, and by the 1850s occupied nine houses and had extended into a prime position between Piccadilly and Regent Street. The store kept up with fashion, both in the items sold and in its customers, in 1866 adding an extension to accommodate a showroom for fashion displays and a mourning department. Edgar rode in from Kingston Hill and always assisted when Queen Victoria's family visited the store. He later moved to Eagle House, Clapham Common, Surrey, where he died on 25 September 1869, aged seventy-eight. He was buried at West Norwood cemetery.<br>
<br>No members of the Edgar family were listed among the shareholders on 11 December 1886 when Swan and Edgar was bought out and amalgamated with Halling, Pearce, and Stone as Waterloo House, reverting to Swan and Edgar Ltd ten years later. The company went into liquidation in 1926, but survived on the corner of Piccadilly and Regent Street until its closure on 9 January 1982.<br>
