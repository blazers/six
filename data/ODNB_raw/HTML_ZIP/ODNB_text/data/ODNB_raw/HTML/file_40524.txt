<span class="headword">Aubin,  Penelope</span>  (1679?&#150;1738), <span class="occ">novelist and translator</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27118/', "Sir Richard Temple, third baronet (1634&#150;1697)")</script>, and his mistress, Anne Charleton, second daughter of the physician and natural philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5157/', "Walter Charleton (1620&#150;1707)")</script>. Suggestions, originating with Abb&eacute; Antoine Pr&eacute;vost, that Penelope was the daughter of a French &eacute;migr&eacute; officer have been disproved by recent research that has also added substantially to aspects of her biography  (Welham, &#145;Penelope Aubin&#146;). Anne Charleton and her daughter lived in Hammersmith as neighbours of Catherine of Braganza and, perhaps most important for Penelope's future depictions of good Roman Catholic characters in her novels, as neighbours of the convent of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary. There is no evidence that Penelope was a Catholic, and, though she later stood godparent to children baptized in Huguenot churches, her own religious preferences were staunchly Anglican.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1696 Penelope married Abraham Aubin (<i>d</i>. 1740), the eldest son of a merchant family from Jersey, at St James's Church, Duke's Street, London, without the consent of her parents. The marriage left Penelope without her portion of &pound;1000, though a piqued Sir Richard Temple agreed to pay his daughter &pound;50 a year for life if her husband took her to Jersey and agreed to work in the family business; he died without making arrangements to pay. The Aubins had already travelled to Jersey, where their first child, Marie Anne Arabelle, was baptized on 22 May 1697. By 1699 the family had returned to London, where in June Penelope gave birth to a son, Abraham Harcy, and then a daughter, Penelope, in March 1701. The family initially resided at Key Court, off Bow Lane, close to St Mary Aldermary, where their children were baptized; they also used an address at Princes Court in Lothbury, but by 1730 the family was living in Portugal Row, Lincoln's Inn Fields.<br>
<br>Aubin was an astute businesswoman, and she assumed control of the family's affairs, particularly when her husband served in the army. In 1702 she advised Thomas Fairfax, fifth Baron Fairfax of Cameron, and Richard Savage, fourth Earl Rivers, in a salvaging expedition to the Caribbean, and in 1708 she wisely declined an invitation by the eleventh earl of Morton and the Hon. Charles Egerton, MP for Brackley, to assist in the launching of a controversial private scheme to repatriate the British pirates settled on Madagascar; her evidence during a Board of Trade inquiry in 1709 helped to discredit the scheme.<br>
<br>Pr&eacute;vost suggested that Aubin may have tried her hand at pamphlets on current affairs, but the only writings that survive are three poems, <span class="italic">The Stuarts: a Pindarique Ode</span> (1707), <span class="italic">The Extasy: a Pindarique Ode to her Majesty the Queen</span> (1708), and <span class="italic">The Wellcome: a Poem to his Grace the Duke of Marlbourough</span> (1709). The poems are Aubin's most autobiographical works, alluding to her royalist heritage and her Anglicanism. However, Aubin's literary career only began in earnest in the 1720s. Between 1721 and 1729 she produced seven novels, <span class="italic">The Strange Adventures of the Count de Vinevil</span> (1721), <span class="italic">The Life of Madam de Beaumount</span> (1721), <span class="italic">The Life and Amorous Adventures of Lucinda</span> (1721), <span class="italic">The Noble Slaves</span> (1722), <span class="italic">The Life of Charlotta du Pont</span> (1723), <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Lady Lucy</span> (1726), and <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Young Count Albertus</span> (1728). Aubin's characters engage in world travel and survive on desert islands, but more central are the human predators&#151;pirates, slave masters, rapists, and tyrants&#151;who threaten them. Her heroines' resistance to these evils and their final victories are based on a belief that &#145;there is a just God, who rewards Virtue, and does punish Vice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Madam de Beaumount</span>). The novels were popular and the fact that &#145;works proffering such ideological resolutions sold well&#146; has been described as evidence of Aubin's &#145;shrewd insight into the marketability of her novels&#146;  (De Bruyn, 12). Aubin's novels also drew on experience; when, for example, one of her brothers-in-law wrote from Barbados describing how his ship had been taken by pirates, thinly disguised details of the attack appeared in <span class="italic">Charlotta du Pont</span>.<br>
<br>Aubin introduced the English to various French texts: she edited <span class="italic">Doctrine of Morality &hellip; According to the Stoick Philosophy</span> (1721), Thomas Mannington Gibbs's translation of the work by Marin le Roy, sieur de Gomberville, republished in 1726 as <span class="italic">Moral Virtue Delineated</span>. Aubin also produced <span class="italic">The Adventures of the Prince of Clermont, and Madame de Ravezan</span> (1722) and <span class="italic">The Life of the Countess de Gondez</span> (1729) from the originals by Louise-Genevi&egrave;ve Gomez de Vasconcellos and Marguerite de Lussan. In the dedication of <span class="italic">The History of Genghizcan the Great</span> (1722), her translation of a work by Fran&ccedil;ois P&eacute;tis de la Croix, she proposed the great warrior&#151;&#145;Chaste, Just, and Temperate; an excellent Husband, Father, Friend and Master&#146;&#151;as a model for England's nobility. Her most important translation is that of Robert Challes's <span class="italic">Les illustres fran&ccedil;aises</span> (1713), which she retitled <span class="italic">The Illustrious French Lovers</span> (1726), a work to which Samuel Richardson in <span class="italic">Pamela</span> and Pr&eacute;vost in <span class="italic">Manon Lescaut</span> may be indebted.<br>
<br>Nor was Aubin a stranger to the London stage. In 1724 &#145;cards of Mrs Aubins&#146; (possibly as some form of benefit night) were presented for a performance of John Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 2 January. In December 1730 Aubin's own play <span class="italic">The Merry Masqueraders, or, The Humorous Cuckold</span> was performed at the New Theatre in the Haymarket. Aubin spoke the epilogue and was granted the revenues of the second and final performance. The play has traditionally been viewed as a failure but evidence that it was published in 1732 and reprinted in 1733 with a new edition in 1734 makes its success or otherwise unclear. What is more certain is that by 1730 Aubin was comfortable on stage. In April 1729 she established the Lady's Oratory at York Buildings, Villiers Street, and&#151;announcing herself as &#145;Mrs Aubin&#146; against &#145;Mr Henly&#146;&#151;positioned herself in opposition to John &#145;Orator&#146; Henley. These performances included mockery of Henley's claims that his oratory was in Lincoln's Inn Fields, rather than Clare Market, and parodying his &#145;henletical&#146; style of oration.<br>
<br>Aubin died in April 1738 at the house of her doctor, William Smithson, who was the dedicatee of <span class="italic">The Illustrious French Lovers</span>. She was interred at the church of St George the Martyr, Southwark, on 23 April 1738. She was predeceased by all her children but was survived by her husband, who was buried at St Helier's parish church, Jersey, on 3 April 1740.<br>
<br>A collected edition of Aubin's novels was published in 1739 and several editions of <span class="italic">The Noble Slaves</span> and <span class="italic">Charlotta du Pont</span> appeared in England and America between 1777 and 1815. However, she was subsequently ignored, largely because of the perception of her as a pious woman author. Commentators since the 1960s have observed in her travel adventures a &#145;genuine cultural anxiety over the weakening moral structure of a perplexingly changing society&#146;  (Beasley, 218) and a &#145;coherent ethical design&#146;  (Warner, 578) that counterbalances this anxiety with the redemptive figure of the courageous woman and virtuous wife, a figure that tacitly undermines the prevailing view of women as &#145;subordinate and submissive&#146;  (Zagordnik, 127). More recently Aubin's characterization as a pious stepping stone from Eliza Haywood and Delarivier Manley to Richardson has been reconsidered. Further examination of Aubin's novels has found that, despite the piety of her prefaces, her works contain &#145;erotic scenes at least as explicit and sexually charged (if not more so as the novels progressed) than in the works of Haywood or Manley&#146;  (Mounsey, 59). And, with many recent findings in Aubin's biography, there will no doubt continue to be revisions of her contribution to the eighteenth-century novel.<br>
