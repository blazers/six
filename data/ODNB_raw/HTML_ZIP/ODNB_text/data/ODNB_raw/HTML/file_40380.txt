<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Meacham <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Cuthbert]</span>,  Gwendoline Emily</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Wendy Wood]</span>  (1892&#150;1981), <span class="occ">Scottish nationalist</span>, was born on 29 October 1892 at 62 Earl Street, Maidstone, Kent, one of three daughters of Charles Stephen Meacham, a scientist, and his wife, Florence Wood. Her Scottish ancestry was on her mother's side, and her mother was herself a Scottish patriot whose father had been involved in Garibaldi's uprising and who told Meacham tales of Wallace as a child. Her father, however, was always an &#145;empire man&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Yours Sincerely</span>, 9). In 1899 her father was offered a senior position in a brewing firm, as a result of which the family emigrated to South Africa. Later he inaugurated the South African Society of Artists, and his daughter first exhibited her own art in the colony under the society's auspices. Later in life she exhibited regularly at the Royal Scottish Academy and Society of Scottish Artists. Her mother was a still-life painter, her grandfather Samuel Wood was a sculptor, and her great-uncle Thomas Peploe Wood was a painter, so an affection for art clearly ran deep in the family.<br>
<br>Meacham's childhood experience of Boer attitudes to the British seems to have helped to form her later political opinions, and indeed Scottish nationalists of the 1890s, such as Theodore Napier, drew a strong analogy between the Scots and the Boers. In 1902 Meacham was sent to Hamilton House School, Tunbridge Wells, and later she went to London to study art under Walter Sickert in Chelsea, dividing her time between her older sister in the capital and the family home, Scaur Topp, near Dumfries, which had been designed by her father; later she went to the Westminster School of Art, and gained the certificate of the Royal Drawing Society in 1909. Sympathetic to the suffragettes, she joined the Women's Volunteers. In 1913 she married Walter Robertson Cuthbert, a shoe manufacturer. She and her husband went on honeymoon to Basutoland, where their guide was Roger Casement's brother Tom. Subsequently they went to Scotland to live in Ayr, where her husband built her a studio, as he did later in Dundee. Their first daughter, Cora, was born in 1915. Her husband was unsympathetic to her artistic ambitions, and by this time she was beginning to be politically active. A home-rule Liberal in 1912, in 1916 she joined the Scottish League and in 1918 the Scottish Home Rule Association. In her autobiography, <span class="italic">Yours Sincerely for Scotland</span>, she claims that she experienced some kind of nationalist epiphany at the Wallace monument in 1913.<br>
<br>In 1914 Meacham's husband worked at a munitions factory then went into the artillery. After suffering a miscarriage, she gave birth to a second daughter, Irralee, in 1918, and she went to London to explore an acting career before returning to Ayr. Owing to financial difficulties the family moved to Dundee in the early 1920s where she gave art lessons. In 1923 she obtained a job with BBC radio in Glasgow, and from 1924 was &#145;lady organizer&#146; in Dundee responsible for <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> and <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span>. From 1926 she featured on <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> as Auntie Gwen. Reading aloud to children was one of her fortes: in later life she gave public readings in Edinburgh city libraries, and as late as the 1970s she was the storyteller in <span class="italic">Jackanory</span>. During the 1920s she also worked as a talented if somewhat sentimental illustrator for the children's comic <span class="italic">Little Dots</span>. In 1927 she joined Lewis Spence's Scottish national movement. She made her own friends, and she and her husband separated, and eventually divorced. At this stage Wendy Cuthbert joined the National Party of Scotland, which had recently been founded (1928), and took her mother's maiden name for her writing, becoming henceforth Wendy Wood. Rather like a Scottish version of Maud Gonne, Wood, &#145;the queen of demagogues&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Yours Sincerely</span>, 198), raised nationalist consciousness through repeated addresses at public meetings: she averaged thirty-two of these a year, and in 1957 spoke at no fewer than seventy-three.<br>
<br>In 1931 Wood started Scottish Watch, a youth movement which at one time claimed more members in Scotland than the Scouts. Leading Scottish intellectuals such as Sir James Frazer were asked to act as patrons to the movement, which gained the support of the <span class="italic">Daily Record</span>. In 1932, at the Bannockburn rally, Wood led a group of nationalists into Stirling Castle to pull down the union flag and put up a lion rampant in its stead. This direct action offended many in the National Party of Scotland, with whom Wood's relations became steadily more strained. The following year she started an anti-conscription league. In 1939 she met a fellow patriot called Mac, who had connections with Irish nationalism. She spent the war with him in a croft on Glen Uig in Moidart and when the relationship broke up, she moved to another croft. In <span class="italic">Mac's Croft</span> (1946) he is described as her &#145;husband&#146;  (p. 13), but this appears to have been a euphemism. In 1947 she made a fund-raising and publicity trip to the United States, and was appointed to an official position in the Scottish National Party (founded in 1934 from the merger of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party). However, like her contemporary the writer Hugh MacDiarmid, she could not endure the demands of party discipline, and drifted away to form the Scottish Patriots, an organization dedicated to the cultural nationalism Wood saw the Scottish National Party as neglecting.<br>
<br>Wood stood twice for election for Edinburgh town council in 1935 and at the Glasgow Bridgeton by-election in 1946, where she gained 14 per cent of the vote. She was arrested and detained in the 1930s for disrupting a blackshirt rally, and was twice in prison: in 1951, when she was found guilty of inciting the crowd in Trafalgar Square on the day of a Scotland v. England football match, and for non-payment of national insurance as a protest against the state of women's prisons. That same year she showed a side of her policy of direct action not likely to appeal to either the British government or the Scottish National Party by speaking at an old IRA rally in co. Kildare, where &#145;her speech &hellip; was given with such sincerity and earnestness that it evoked a storm of applause from &hellip; hundreds of IRA veterans&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Yours Sincerely</span>, 184).<br>
<br>After moving to 31 Howard Place, Edinburgh, at the end of the 1950s, Wood's nationalist activities entered a new phase. Following her address to its general assembly in 1961, the Church of Scotland accepted the policy of home rule. In 1966 her pressure was instrumental in persuading the Post Office to issue Robert Burns stamps and in 1972 the Post Office in Scotland also advised against the use of E2R on the silver wedding stamps  (NL Scot., Wood folder 26). In December 1972 she commenced a hunger strike for Scottish home rule. Jim Sillars (then a Labour MP) made a television plea to her to end the strike, and she conceded after the secretary of state, Gordon Campbell (who lost his seat to the Scottish National Party in 1974), &#145;repeated undertakings&#146; to publish a green paper &#145;after the Royal Commission had reported&#146;  (Kemp, 118). She placed a union flag under the staircarpet of her Georgian villa in Howard Place so that she could tread on it every day: towards the end of her life she gave fragments of the flag away as trophies to her younger supporters. She also grew a cutting in the garden from the rose at Fassifern in Lochaber said to be the very one from which Prince Charles had taken his white rose badge in 1745. In her later years she appeared increasingly interested in Jacobitism, and along with her supporters entertained the claims of &#145;Prince&#146; Michael, a Belgian citizen, to be the &#145;direct and lawful heir&#146; of the Stuarts. Wood herself always supported direct action and civil disobedience, and stated that &#145;Patriots finding themselves in trouble with the law would be supported completely &hellip; providing their offence was not of a serious criminal nature and directly against Patriots' policies&#146;  (minutes of the group meeting, 8 July 1979, priv. coll.). She died on 30 June 1981 in the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Wood had a striking appearance, with piercing blue eyes and a rugged, purposeful look. She was a poet and illustrator of some talent, and published a number of books on her own life, and on folklore, lifestyle, and travel; these included <span class="italic">The Baby in the Glass</span> (1918), <span class="italic">The Chickabiddies Book</span> (1927), <span class="italic">The Secret of Spey</span> (1930), <span class="italic">I Like Life</span> (1938, her first autobiography), <span class="italic">Mac's Croft</span> (1946), <span class="italic">From a Highland Croft</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Legends of the Borders</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">The Silver Chanter</span> (1980). Her liking for folklore no doubt had some connection to her reputed gift of second sight. Her final autobiography, <span class="italic">Yours Sincerely for Scotland</span>, was published in 1970; in 1985 Joy Hendry edited a posthumous collection of her poems and illustrations under the title <span class="italic">Astronauts and Tinklers</span> (1985).<br>
<br>Whatever Wood's limitations and excesses, her determined impossibilism helped to put Scottish nationalism on the map. The Patriots' policy of recalling the Scottish estates had something in common with the constitutional convention of the late 1980s and early 1990s: indeed, the Patriots were in essence an oddball &#145;cross-party campaigning organisation&#146;  (Mitchell, 99). Though given to inflammatory posturing, they were never dangerous, and through the indefatigable activity of their leader played a significant role in defining a distinctive Scottish politics, though in their day their extremism rendered them marginal.<br>
