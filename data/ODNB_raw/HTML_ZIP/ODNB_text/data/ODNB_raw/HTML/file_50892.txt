<span class="headword">Mount,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1654, <em>d.</em> 1722), <span class="occ">nautical publisher</span>, the only son of three known children of Ralph Mount, yeoman, of Chislet, Kent, and his wife, Mary Court, was baptized on 16 November 1654 at Elmsted, Kent, where his parents had been married in January of that year. In 1670 Mount was apprenticed to William Fisher, bookseller and publisher of Postern Row, Tower Hill, London. Fisher's business, founded by his predecessor William Lugger, was in the heart of maritime London, near the river and Trinity House, and already specialized in mathematical and navigational books. In 1677 Fisher extended this by taking a share in <span class="italic">The English Pilot, Mediterranean</span>, part of the first comprehensive English maritime atlas begun by John Seller in 1671, and in 1679 went on to acquire rights, copper plates, and printed sheets for some other parts of <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span> and Seller's <span class="italic">Atlas maritimus</span>.<br>
<br>Mount married William Fisher's daughter Sarah (<i>bap</i>. 1657?, <i>d</i>. 1717) on 3 October 1682 and from 1684, although he was not formally freed of his apprenticeship until 1693, his name began to appear on publications both jointly with Fisher's and on his own account. When Fisher died in 1692 Mount inherited the business. This inheritance from his father-in-law, which included substantial parts of <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span> and copyright in a number of successful maritime books, laid the foundations for the control over English nautical publishing which Mount achieved during the next thirty years.<br>
<br>In his first years as proprietor Mount was in his prime and, as well as continuing to trade as a successful general bookseller and stationer, worked energetically to build on the firm's lead in the maritime field. He published James Atkinson's <span class="italic">An Epitome of the Art of Navigation</span>, and acquired sole ownership of popular titles in which Fisher had had a share, such as Andrew Wakeley's <span class="italic">The Mariner's Compass Rectified</span>, Nathaniel Colson's <span class="italic">The Mariner's New Kalendar</span>, and Richard Norwood's <span class="italic">Seaman's Practice</span>. The first three of these remained in the firm's list, with numerous editions, over the next hundred years. In 1693 he became the sole distributor of Grenville Collins's <span class="italic">Great Britain's Coasting Pilot</span>, the first English maritime atlas of the English coast. He tried to publish parts of <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span>, which was still incomplete and in complicated multiple ownership, but too many of the plates were still owned by others, principally the chartmaker John Thornton, for his efforts to succeed.<br>
<br>About 1700 Mount took a partner, <a name="cosubject_73395"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Page</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1680?, <em>d.</em> 1733), <span class="occ">nautical publisher</span>, referred to by Mount in his will as &#145;brother Page&#146;. Both men came from Kent (where a Thomas Page was baptized in St Nicholas's Church, Rochester, on 12 December 1680, the son of Alexander and Mary Page), and there were connections between their families. Page was not among the half-dozen apprentices formally bound to Mount and when he was made free of the Stationers' Company in 1716 was described as Mount's servant. There is no evidence of the nature of Page's contribution to the partnership, and he does not appear to have had a share in the ownership of many of the firm's books, but his arrival marked the beginning of nearly a century of successful association between the families of the two men. After the death of John Thornton's son, Samuel, in 1715, the firm of Mount and Page acquired Thornton's <span class="italic">English Pilot</span> plates and stock, which made them sole owners of all parts of the <span class="italic">Pilot</span>. They also acquired the plates of Collins's <span class="italic">Great Britain's Coasting Pilot</span> and published a new edition just after Mount's death. With these new acquisitions Richard Mount achieved a near monopoly of English nautical publishing for his firm. Mount regularly brought out new titles and the firm now controlled not only the best selling navigation books but also both the only important English maritime atlases. The firm had its own printing works and printed for several naval departments, including the Navy Office, parts of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, and the transport board, and for Trinity House, a link which was maintained into the twentieth century by Mount's successors. Outside the maritime world its customers included St Thomas's Hospital and the South Sea Company.<br>
<br>Richard Mount died on 29 June 1722 at his home at Postern Row, Tower Hill, London, after a kick in the leg from a carthorse on London Bridge, and was buried at St Katharine by the Tower. He was a respected sober City figure, and had served twice as master of the Stationers' Company and presented a clock to its court room. He was comfortably off and owned several houses near the Postern Row premises and the right to collect tolls for passing through nearby George Yard. A contemporary commented:<blockquote>Mr Mount is not only a moderate, but has a natural antipathy to excess: he hates hoarding either money or goods and being a charitable man, he values nothing but the use of it, and has a tender love for truth. (J. Dunton, <span class="italic">The Life and Errors of John Dunton</span>, 1818, 219)</blockquote>He requested that his funeral should be private, attended only by his close family and the money saved distributed among his less prosperous relations. He had been fortunate in his inheritance but had turned it to good account.Mount and his wife had three sons: William, the eldest, who succeeded him in the business, Fisher, and John. He left them advice which extolled moderation and good works, and warned them to &#145;be very cautious of being decoyed by the specious Pretense of Projectors, or of trusting others too far in the Management of any Part of your Estate; and have a care of adventuring on hazardous Undertakings&#146;  (appended to <span class="italic">A Sermon Occasioned by Death of Mr Richard Mount</span>, 1722).<br>
<br>After the deaths of Richard Mount and Thomas Page, who died in London on 15 March 1733, the firm passed through the hands of three more generations of each family, trading under varying combinations of the Mount and Page names. Page was twice married, first, by 1704, to Elizabeth, of whom no more is known other than that she was the mother of at least four of his children. By 1721 she was dead and at some point after this he married Mary Crompton, who survived him with further children. Richard's son William Mount (1688&#150;1769) led the firm for thirty years, most of them in partnership with Page's son, Thomas Page II (1704&#150;1762). They were followed by William's son, John Mount (1725&#150;1786), and Thomas Page III (1730&#150;1781). They were succeeded by their sons, William Mount II (1753&#150;1815) and Thomas Page IV (1756&#150;1797). The families were linked by marriage no fewer than three times during the century, and both grew prosperous and acquired country houses and land. Richard Mount had left them all the advantages of a virtual monopoly of a specialized market, which was expanding fast as the numbers of English ships increased, but although they were commercially successful for fifty years after his death Mount's descendants perhaps paid too much attention to his urging of caution in their undertakings and too little to his example of vigour. The firm did little or nothing to update or add to their new editions of <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span> or <span class="italic">Great Britain's Coasting Pilot</span>, and although many books were reprinted regularly the number of new titles gradually dropped. They failed to meet the higher standards expected as navigational knowledge expanded in the second half of the century or compete with the new businesses attracted into both chart and book publishing by the growing market. They gradually lost their share of the nautical market and by 1800 became purely a stationery business. The name Mount disappeared from the firm's title at the same time, though its successors continued to trade as stationers until 1974, under the name Smith and Ebbs.<br>
