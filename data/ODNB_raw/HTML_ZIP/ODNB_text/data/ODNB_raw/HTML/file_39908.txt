<span class="headword">Kentner,  Louis Philip</span>  (1905&#150;1987), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born Lajos Kentner on 19 July 1905 in Karwin, Silesia, Austria&#150;Hungary, the only son and elder child of Julius Kentner, stationmaster, and his wife, Gisela Buchsbaum. He was educated at the <i>Gymnasium</i> in Budapest and the Royal Franz Liszt Academy of Music, also in Budapest. This was a remarkable beginning: he was only six years old, and simultaneously a school pupil and an academician. He studied the piano with Arnold Szekely and composition with Hans Koessler, Le&oacute; Weiner, and Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly. Both Weiner and Kod&aacute;ly were lifetime influences. He gained a diploma in musical composition.<br>
<br>Composition was Kentner's first ambition. Three sonatinas were published (by Oxford University Press) in the 1930s, and there were later performances of a string quartet and a divertimento for chamber orchestra. But it was the piano that was to become the centre of his musical life. His concert career began with a recital in Budapest when he was thirteen. From the 1920s he undertook a ceaseless round of concerts around the world, his fame spreading rapidly. He went back to Hungary, but with the political situation worsening emigration beckoned, and he decided to move to England in 1935, becoming one of the mid-Europeans who transformed Britain's musical life. He became a British citizen in 1946, and London remained his home until his death.<br>
<br>In an early review (in the <span class="italic">Sunday Referee</span> of 11 October 1936), headed &#145;A new&#151;and great&#151;pianist comes to England&#146;, Constant Lambert wrote:<blockquote>What gives Kentner's playing its exceptional quality, however, is not so much his technical ability, which he shares with several virtuosos, but the remarkable intelligence and musical instinct which direct this ability &hellip; I have never heard a pianist of such power who at the same time has such delicacy and subtlety of tone gradation &hellip; a pianist with a brilliant future.</blockquote>Lambert immediately discerned Kentner's exceptional musicianship, as did William Walton and the Sitwells, who were warm supporters and friends. He became an admired performer in solo recitals and concertos&#151;an early Mozart concerto with Sir Thomas Beecham was a landmark&#151;as also in chamber music, a lifelong passion. For some years there was a trio with Yehudi Menuhin and the cellist Gaspar Cassad&oacute;. Music-making with Menuhin, who married Kentner's second wife's sister, was an important activity over the years.<br>
<br>Kentner's repertory was enormous and ranged from Bach to Bart&oacute;k. He was especially noted for his Chopin and Liszt, the latter being most remarkable. Liszt's music had been regarded as superficial and it was &#145;not done&#146; to perform it. It was largely due to Kentner's championship and deeply felt performances that Liszt came to be treated as a composer of serious beauty. In 1951 he was one of the founders of the Liszt Society, and from 1965 to his death its president.<br>
<br>Kentner gave the first performances of Bart&oacute;k's second piano concerto (conducted by Otto Klemperer, 1933) and&#151;in Europe&#151;his third concerto (conducted by Sir Adrian Boult, 1946), the first piano concerto of Alan Rawsthorne in 1942, the piano concerto of Michael Tippett (1956), and, with Menuhin, of Walton's sonata for violin and piano. He was gifted with a formidable technique and a faultless memory. But what governed his playing was a constant quest for musical truth and his faithfulness to the composer's intention, with which he wished to identify. So his performances moved one both through their effortlessness&#151;though he never tried to dazzle&#151;and his sensitivity, accuracy, and, above all, musical humility. He seemed to be communing with the composer, and this musicianship transmitted itself to the listener. He was one of the last great romantic pianists and his eightieth birthday concert in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, caused a spontaneous standing ovation. Fortunately, a number of splendid recordings were made.<br>
<br>The same qualities inspired Kentner's teaching, whether in master classes at the Yehudi Menuhin School of Music or with individual pupils in his studio. His standards were high and criticisms tough, though spiced with good Hungarian sarcasm (&#145;Why play the wrong note when the right one is next door?&#146;). There was no didactic method, just a search for musical truth. Technique was taught <i>through</i> the music, and Kentner could translate brilliantly musical points into words. He wrote: &#145;no teacher can put anything into a pupil which is not already there. He can only awake what is already lying dormant, and guide it towards possible short cuts, tending and nurturing it as it grows.&#146; And so his pupils were inspired. He also liked writing, and his little book, <span class="italic">Piano</span> (1976), is necessary reading for any aspiring pianist. He became an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in 1970 and was appointed CBE in 1978.<br>
<br>Physically, Kentner was small in build, and he looked even smaller on his very low (collapsible) piano stool. He had a beautiful head, and an ever-hovering smile. A gentle warmth emanated from him, coupled with a special sense of humour, sometimes wicked, always witty. He was a brilliant raconteur, equalled only by his second wife, Griselda. His wide reading made him into a typically cultured mid-European.<br>
<br>In 1931 Kentner married a pianist, Ilona, daughter of Ede Kabos, journalist and writer. They were divorced in 1945 and in 1946 he married Griselda Katharine, sister of Diana, who married Yehudi Menuhin the following year, and daughter of Gerard Louis Eugene Gould (<i>d</i>. 1916), of the special branch in the Foreign Office, and his wife, the pianist Evelyn Suart. There were no children of either marriage. Kentner and Griselda shared the remainder of his life, and he spoke often of how central to his playing and life Griselda was: he wrote of her as &#145;beautiful, talented, angelic, highly musical withal&#146;. Kentner died at their home at 1 Mallord Street, Chelsea, on 22 September 1987.<br>
