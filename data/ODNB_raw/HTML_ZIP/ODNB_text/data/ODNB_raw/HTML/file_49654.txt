<span class="headword">Godwin, Dame  Beatrice Annie <span class="st"> [Anne]</span></span>  (1897&#150;1992), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 6 July 1897 in Frith Hill, Farncombe, Surrey, into the large family of William Godwin (<i>d</i>. 1932), leather dresser and draper, and his wife, Louisa Clare, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pearce. She attended the British School in Godalming, Surrey, but, with no money for her further education, left school aged fifteen.<br>
<br>At sixteen Godwin became a clerk in the counting-house of a West End store in London, earning 5<i>s</i>. a week. In 1916 she moved to the army pay office, where she remained for three years as a poorly paid civilian clerk. She was among a deputation of young women who asked the army paymaster for more money, but with no union backing they were shouted down. Godwin realized that office workers must become organized. Her sister Elsie, a civil servant, introduced her to the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries, a small, &eacute;litist union of highly qualified, mainly civil service, employees. Godwin joined in 1921, having trained as a shorthand typist. In the mid-1920s she helped to establish and became a prominent member of the Young Suffragettes, who were campaigning to have the vote extended to young women under the age of thirty (an aim achieved in 1928).<br>
<br>After employment in the offices of engineering and printing firms, Godwin joined the staff of the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries in 1925, becoming a full-time London organizer in 1928 and assistant secretary in 1931. She also became active on the National Joint Committee of Working Women's Organisations. In 1940 the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries merged with the National Union of Clerks to become the Clerical and Administrative Workers' Union (CAWU). Godwin became assistant general secretary and confirmed delegate to the TUC annual conference for five years. One of her official duties was to edit the union's journal, <span class="italic">The Clerk</span>. In 1949 she was unexpectedly elected to one of the TUC's reserved seats for women, which she retained until 1962, fully representing clerks in an unrivalled style.<br>
<br>One of Godwin's goals was equal pay for work of equal value, coupled with equal opportunity and responsibility. She and Anne Loughlin pushed for the principle from 1944, and at the International Labour Organization conference in 1951, Convention 100, which accepted equal pay, was carried by two-thirds of the conference delegates (though it was not ratified in Great Britain until 1971). In the 1950s the CAWU was the most adamant and successful union in the campaign for equal pay. Godwin was appointed OBE in 1952 for her efforts. Within the TUC she chaired the national women's advisory committee for some years, and was president of the National Federation of Professional Workers. She considered running for parliament but decided that trade union work was more rewarding.<br>
<br>In 1956 Godwin was elected general secretary of the CAWU, the first woman to rise to the top of a mixed-sex union. She aimed to attract more white-collar workers into the union, and she led her union through a period of expansion and consolidation, impressing other union leaders with her flair and authority. A moderate socialist, she worked relentlessly against communist control of unions and supported the expulsion of communist-dominated unions from the TUC.<br>
<br>One of Godwin's great concerns was the promotion of better educational opportunities for the working class. She worked for the Mary Macarthur educational trust, which enabled working women to obtain further education, and served on the national trade union committee of the Workers' Educational Association, the Carr Saunders committee on education for commerce, and the Central Advisory Council for Education (England). She was co-author of the Crowther report in 1959, produced by the Central Advisory Council for Education, and was a member of the court of the University of Southampton. She believed that a good general education was of paramount importance, and that there should be special full-time pre-employment courses or part-time employment with compulsory day release, not vocational training at school. She attended weekend and summer schools and continued to campaign for more training and further education at TUC annual congresses. She believed that standards of office competence were falling because employers did not encourage further training.<br>
<br>Despite her dislike of strikes, Godwin achieved her biggest success and most publicity by winning a battle with the Automobile Association in 1960 over recognition of the CAWU, after eight members of staff were sacked for walking out in protest over working conditions. The duke of Edinburgh resigned as patron during the five-and-a-half-week strike. In less sensational negotiations Godwin was noted for her leadership skills and word power. Often she was the only woman in joint union teams negotiating with companies in fields as diverse as air transport, coalmining, and electricity supply. She enjoyed a good working relationship with male union officials.<br>
<br>In August 1961 Godwin was elected president of the TUC, the third woman to hold the post. She was acutely aware of the need to bring the TUC up to date, as advancing technology meant fewer manual workers. During a hectic year she managed to tour all the union areas in the UK. She used her president's speech to the TUC conference in 1962 to attack the government's National Incomes Commission, and to voice her disappointment that the state school system was improving so slowly. She was created DBE in 1962 in recognition of her contribution to the CAWU and for her public work, especially in education.<br>
<br>After her year as president, Godwin retired from union activity. She became a governor of the BBC (1962&#150;8) and was appointed a full-time member of the industrial court (1963&#150;9). She joined the editorial board of the moderate <span class="italic">Socialist Commentary</span> and, disillusioned by the militants in the Labour Party, became a founder member of the Social Democratic Party in 1981. She enjoyed cooking and entertaining in the house she shared with her sister Elsie, and was a keen gardener until overtaken by infirmity. She died at the Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, on 11 January 1992, of bronchopneumonia.<br>
<br>A tall, well dressed woman, Godwin looked like the prim headmistress of a girls' school while president of the TUC, but she loved dancing and drinking (in moderation) with the boys. She had one of the sharpest and best-read minds in the TUC, and was noted for her pragmatism and common sense. In negotiation, as she told a <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> reporter in September 1961, &#145;I'm very, very tough. I can make my voice heard well across any conference room&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 15 Sept 1961). It was these qualities, coupled with driving ambition, that took Godwin to the top in her chosen career.<br>
