<span class="headword">Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Thomas of Lancaster]</span>, duke of Clarence  (1387&#150;1421), <span class="occ">prince and soldier</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12951/', "Henry IV")</script>, born in London in the autumn of 1387 to Mary de Bohun (<i>c</i>.1369&#150;1394), Henry's first wife. As children he and his brothers moved around the Lancaster and Bohun castles and after the death of their mother lived for a time in the households of John of Gaunt and Margaret, the countess marshal. He was knighted on 12 October 1399, on the eve of his father's coronation, and appointed steward of England. He became a knight of the Garter in 1400.<br>
<br>The danger that Ireland would be swept into the Welsh revolt led Henry IV to appoint Thomas king's lieutenant there from 18 July 1401 with a salary of &pound;8000 per annum, but no more than a fraction of this was effectively paid and by August 1402 he found himself reduced to impotence in Dublin.<br>
<br>By November 1403, with more than a year's salary in arrears, Thomas returned to England and served briefly the following year in the relief of Coety Castle in Glamorgan. In February 1405 he replaced the indisposed earl of Somerset as admiral of the fleet to guard the sea off Dover for a quarter of a year. In March 1406 he again indented for service in Ireland for twelve years, his salary as lieutenant being now fixed at &pound;6000 p.a. He deferred sailing for another two years until persuaded to accept a commission for three years at a salary of &pound;4666, the first payment being allocated on specific revenues with the promise that he would be paid his arrears. He reached Dublin on 2 August 1408, arrested the earl of Kildare, and conducted a campaign in Leinster before holding a parliament at Kilkenny in January 1409. But in March his father's illness gave him the occasion to return and he remained at court with his retinue, resisting the urging of his brother Henry [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12952/', "Henry V")</script>] to resign his office and the refusal of the council to pay him his second year's salary unless he returned to Ireland. Thomas clung to his lieutenancy for its status and as a source of income, yet his cavalier attitude to his duties there brought reprimands from the council which, under Prince Henry, governed England in the years 1410&#150;11.<br>
<br>By 1411, despite being the king's favourite son, Thomas had still no title, few lands, and little military experience. All three came in the next two years. On 16 August 1410 he had a papal dispensation to marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98133/', "Margaret Holland")</script>, the widow of the recently deceased John Beaufort, earl of Somerset, although this was obstructed by Somerset's brother, Bishop Beaufort, until May 1412. By his marriage he then gained control not only of his wife's lands to the value of &pound;1400 p.a. but also the custody of Somerset's heirs and their inheritance. On 9 July following he himself was created earl of Aumale and duke of Clarence with an annuity of 2000 marks. Wealth and title were prerequisites for the major military command which he was now given. He had urged acceptance of the treaty of Bourges (18 May 1412) by which the duke of Orl&eacute;ans and other Armagnac lords offered to vest Henry IV with Aquitaine in return for military assistance against the duke of Burgundy, and when it became clear that the king could not himself lead the expedition Clarence was appointed its commander on 8 June. This was a snub to Prince Henry, who saw himself supplanted in his father's favour and his succession jeopardized. The rift between the brothers became common knowledge and a cause for alarm. Many regarded Thomas as the more kingly and warlike figure, and the army of 4000 men which he led through western France devastated the land with impunity to south of the Loire. Meanwhile the Armagnac lords had made peace with the duke of Burgundy and had to buy off the English army with a large ransom of 210,000 &eacute;cus at the treaty of Buzan&ccedil;ais (14 November 1412). The expedition was a preliminary to Henry V's subsequent invasion and brought Clarence honour and profit. Having wintered in Bordeaux he returned in April 1413 following Prince Henry's succession to the throne.<br>
<br>Whatever their previous differences Henry V now made Thomas his partner in the enterprise of war. Clarence mustered one of the largest companies (of 240 men-at-arms and 720 archers) in 1415 at Southampton where, before sailing, he presided at the trial of Cambridge, Scrope, and Grey. But at Harfleur he was among those who succumbed to dysentery and had to return to England before the march to Agincourt. He took part in the ceremonial reception of the emperor Sigismund in 1416 and briefly acted as keeper of the realm when Henry V attended the tripartite conference at Calais in September. When, on 1 August 1417, he landed at Touques with Henry V he embarked on a period of sustained campaigning which ended only with his death. He immediately displayed his mettle at the siege of Caen, where he led the scaling party and captured the Abbaye aux Hommes, saving it from destruction. His men were given leave to plunder the town, from which the inhabitants were driven, and Clarence sent to the mayor of London for English settlers, thus initiating an occupation that was to last until 1450. Moving south he took Alen&ccedil;on and joined the king for the winter siege of Falaise. Following its surrender in February 1418 Clarence was granted the <i>vicomt&eacute;s</i> of Auge, Orbec, and Pont Audemer for life; in his move to occupy these he reduced a series of fortresses along the line of the Risle including Harcourt and Bec-Hellouin. With reinforcements for his company brought over from England in June, he was present at the sieges of Louviers and Pont de l'Arche, and by 1 August was encamped outside Rouen at the Porte Cauchoise. In his company were his stepson Henry Beaufort, earl of Somerset, and Edward Holland, count of Mortain, both recent arrivals, in their teens, who fell victim to the disease in the encampment. Following the fall of Rouen in January 1419 the English advance carried him to Vernon and Mantes, and he was at Meulan in May and June for Henry V's fruitless negotiations with the duke of Burgundy. The seizure of Pontoise on 31 July by John Holland, earl of Huntingdon, enabled Clarence to conduct a daring <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> to the walls of Paris which precipitated the flight of Charles VI to Troyes.<br>
<br>The treaty of Troyes in May 1420 proved to be only an interlude in the continuing campaign, and from July to November Clarence was occupied in the sieges of Montereau and Melun where he was joined by his Beaufort stepsons whom his wife had brought to France in the previous year. Throughout the conquest of Normandy, Clarence had operated under the eye of Henry V in what had been predominantly a war of sieges. When the king left for England early in 1421 Clarence was given supreme command. To forestall the advance of a Franco-Scottish force into south-west Normandy, and eager to win the renown in battle which had hitherto evaded him, he led a small army into Maine and Anjou, but was intercepted at Baug&eacute; on the return from Angers. Ill-informed of the size and movements of the enemy, but hoping to win advantage by surprise, he resolved on an immediate attack, discounting the advice of his lieutenants Huntingdon and Gilbert Umfraville to consolidate his own force and position. On 22 March, in confused hand-to-hand fighting, Clarence was killed and Huntingdon and his two Beaufort stepsons were captured. His body was recovered from the field by men of Thomas Montagu, earl of Salisbury, who conducted the retreat. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral where his widow erected a tomb with the effigies of her two husbands in St Michael's Chapel.<br>
<br>Clarence was a bold and spirited commander whose reputation attracted a war retinue both numerous and distinguished. He saw soldiering in terms of personal valour and fame and had none of his brother's intellectual approach to war and politics. Almost certainly he felt overshadowed by his elder brother and denied opportunities for service. Before 1417 he had received few material rewards, for in his will of that date he provided for his debts, the wages of his retinue, and his funeral expenses to be paid from the ransom money due from the count of Angoul&ecirc;me of which 123,000 &eacute;cus was still outstanding. By 1421 he was almost certainly richer, both from the spoils of France and the payment of &pound;4838 from the arrears of his annuities, but he had amassed no fortune and bought no further lands. He had no legitimate children and his French fiefs reverted to the crown. His widow died on 30 December 1439.<br>
