<span class="headword">Loder,  Edward James</span>  (1809&#150;1865), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born in Bath, Somerset, on 10 July 1809, one of the seven children of the violinist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16918/', "John David Loder (1788&#150;1846)")</script> and his wife, Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mills. About 1826 he was sent to Frankfurt am Main to study with his father's old friend, Beethoven's pupil Ferdinand Ries, who after several years' residence in London had just returned to the continent. A couple of years later Loder returned to England, and in 1830 he arranged the music for a production of <span class="italic">Black-Eyed Susan</span> at the Theatre Royal, Bath. Shortly thereafter he travelled again to Germany with the intention of studying medicine, but, quickly changing his mind, he resumed his study with Ries. He married, in Bristol on 10 November 1831, Eliza Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson (1811&#150;1880), from whom he was later separated. About 1834 he returned to London and immediately received a commission to compose music for J. S. Arnold's play <span class="italic">Nourjahad</span>, recast as an opera, for the opening of the New Theatre Royal Lyceum and English Opera House after the fire of 1830. The production took place in July 1834, and Loder's music was considered its principal attraction. Unlike the usual English operas, which were primarily a succession of songs and ballads, Loder had attempted to make <span class="italic">Nourjahad</span> a genuine musical drama, and, as such, it was well received by those contemporary critics who wished to see English composers emulating their serious German contemporaries. In little more than a year Loder produced three more works at the Lyceum, which did not, however, aspire to the same high aims; none the less <span class="italic">The Dice of Death</span>, with a libretto by John Oxenford, was moderately successful in 1835.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Loder had entered into an agreement with the music publishers Dalmain &amp; Co. to supply a weekly series of compositions, and for the same firm he wrote his <span class="italic">First Principles of Singing</span> in 1838 and <span class="italic">A Modern Pianoforte Tutor</span> in 1839. Some of the songs composed to fulfil his contract with Dalmain were strung together to make the opera <span class="italic">Francis I</span>, which was produced at Drury Lane in 1838 with limited success; one song, however, &#145;The Old House at Home&#146;, achieved considerable popularity. Another opera, <span class="italic">Little Red Riding Hood</span>, intended for the inauguration of the regime of the impresario Hammond at Drury Lane, was not put into production, and two other stage works, <span class="italic">The Foresters</span> and <span class="italic">The Deer Stalkers</span>, produced in 1838 and 1841, were unambitious. During this period, however, Loder was also working at more consequential compositions: a string quartet in E[flat] (apparently his fourth, though no trace survives of earlier ones) was performed several times at the Society of British Musicians, three sets of songs were published in 1837&#150;8, and around 1840 he issued a number of collections of sacred music, outstanding among which was a set of nine <span class="italic">Sacred Songs and Ballads</span> (1840) with texts by Desmond Ryan and dedicated to Sterndale Bennett.<br>
<br>In 1846 Loder became music director at the Princess's Theatre, and in the same year he staged his &#145;romantic opera&#146; <span class="italic">The Night Dancers</span>, composed to a libretto by George Soane that was based on the same German folk-tale that had provided the plot of Adolphe Adam's ballet <span class="italic">Giselle</span>. More significant musically and dramatically than the other stage works he had written since <span class="italic">Nourjahad</span>, it was an immediate success with press and public, and within twelve months was produced in New York and Sydney. In London it was revived at the Princess's Theatre in 1850 and at Covent Garden in 1860. As well as its abundance of good melodic material, apparent in such numbers as the ballad &#145;Wake, my love&#146;, which was essential for a success in the English theatre, <span class="italic">The Night Dancers</span> displays the masterly orchestration and genuine dramatic instinct that enabled Loder to create something worth while when he chose to exert himself. Fuller Maitland loftily described it in 1902 as having &#145;merits far beyond the trivial tunes with which Balfe caught the ear of his vulgar audiences&#146;  (Fuller Maitland, 42). Many of Loder's works at this time were connected with his duties at the Princess's Theatre; he contributed music to various productions, and in 1848 composed the operetta <span class="italic">The Andalusian</span> and the ballad opera <span class="italic">Robin Goodfellow</span>, though neither of these displays the same level of commitment as <span class="italic">The Night Dancers</span> or enjoyed comparable success. He put more effort into his &#145;operatic masque&#146; <span class="italic">The Island of Calypso</span>, intended for the National Concerts in 1850 but not performed until 14 April 1852, when Berlioz conducted it at Exeter Hall.<br>
<br>In 1851 Loder was appointed music director of the Theatre Royal, Manchester, where he spent his energies in composing, arranging, and conducting the music for the theatre's daily fare. By 1855 he had completed his opera <span class="italic">Raymond and Agnes</span>, originally announced for the Princess's Theatre for the 1849&#150;50 season, and it was given its premi&egrave;re in Manchester on 14 August. Despite its considerable musical and dramatic qualities, it was coolly received and sustained a run of only seven performances. A later production at St James's Theatre, London, in 1859 lasted no more than a week, despite enthusiastic reviews. The opera enjoyed an isolated revival at the Cambridge Arts Theatre, in an edition by Nicholas Temperley and Max Miradin, in 1966.<br>
<br>Shortly after the Manchester production of <span class="italic">Raymond and Agnes</span>, Loder fell ill with a brain disorder that made it necessary for him to relinquish his Manchester post and return to London. A subscription to assist him was advertised in the <span class="italic">Musical World</span> in 1856 and 1857, and performances of his works were facilitated by family and friends. These included the London staging of <span class="italic">Raymond and Agnes</span>; a production of his last theatrical composition, the one-act operetta <span class="italic">Never Judge by Appearances</span>, given at the Adelphi on 7 July 1859; and the 1860 revival of <span class="italic">The Night Dancers</span>. Shortly before his death, a set of <span class="italic">Twelve Songs Sacred and Secular</span> was published by subscription for his benefit. On 13 October 1849, using the name Ernest Loder von Lowe, he married, bigamously, Louise Alice (<i>b</i>. 1827/8), daughter of Charles Forster, artist. The last four years of his life were largely spent in a deep coma, and Loder, living alone, was registered by a neighbour as having died at his lodgings, 101 Bolsover Street, London, on 5 April 1865.<br>
