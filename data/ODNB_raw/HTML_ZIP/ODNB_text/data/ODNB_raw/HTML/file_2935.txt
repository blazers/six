<span class="headword">Bosgrave,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1548&#150;1623), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born at Godmanstone, Dorset, of a staunchly Roman Catholic family. At an early age he was taken to the continent so that he could be brought up in the old faith. After studying humanities at Louvain he found his way to Rome, where he entered the Society of Jesus on 17 November 1564. He made his noviciate and early university studies in Rome, during which time he was a student of Christopher Clavius, the renowned Jesuit astronomer and mathematician.<br>
<br>In 1573 Bosgrave was sent, like many other English Jesuits of his day, to central Europe. Just as the Low Countries and France were the sites of seminaries devoted to training missionaries to evangelize protestant England, so Poland was the site of missionary institutions which trained priests to evangelize the Scandinavian countries and Finland. In November 1573 he was ordained a priest in Krems (Austria). After that he taught Greek and rhetoric at Olomouc in Moravia, Pu&#322;tusk in Poland, and Vilna in Lithuania. About this time he seems to have been restless and suffering from bad health. He wrote to the Jesuit general asking for a new assignment. To breathe one's native air was a standard medical cure-all in those days. This might be the reason he set out for England in the summer of 1580, though Bosgrave himself, as far as we know, complained about his health only once in England and that was when he was brought before the privy council.<br>
<br>On his way to England, Bosgrave met John Rogers, an English diplomat on a trade mission to Denmark and Poland. Suspicious of Bosgrave, Rogers intercepted his mail and discovered that he was a Jesuit. This was the summer of the arrival of Persons and Campion in England and anything Jesuit attracted attention. Rogers sent word to England, probably by the same boat on which Bosgrave had taken passage, that he should be arrested on his arrival. This was effected by the mayor of Orford, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Bosgrave was taken to London where he freely admitted that he was a Roman Catholic and a Jesuit. Brought before the privy council he was asked whether he would attend the established church. He agreed to do so and was set free. He was plainly out of touch with the English religious scene. It was a common thing for Catholics in religiously divided countries to visit other churches. But in England for a Catholic to go to another church was almost equal to apostasy. When he was reproached by English Catholics, he repented of his mistake. Afterwards he wrote an eloquent short piece which was appended to William Allen's <span class="italic">A True Report</span> (1583), entitled <span class="italic">The Satisfaction of M. James Bosgrave</span>. In it he stated that one of the reasons he attended Church of England services was to recover his ability to speak his native tongue. Bosgrave then refused to &#145;go to church&#146;. He was once more arrested and came to trial in November 1581 with Edmund Campion and a dozen others for the crime of plotting the assassination of Queen Elizabeth &#145;in Rome and Rheims&#146;. Bosgrave had some trouble making himself understood when he spoke in his own defence because of his imperfect English. Campion eloquently finished some of the points Bosgrave was trying to make. All the accused were found guilty, but the very day on which Campion, Sherwin, and Briant were executed at Tyburn, Bosgrave and the others convicted with him were sent back to prison.<br>
<br>Bosgrave's case had aroused some interest in Poland, especially in the towns where the English government was trying to negotiate trade agreements. In January 1583 the king of Poland, Stephen Batory, wrote to Queen Elizabeth asking for toleration of Catholics in general and the release of Catholics in prison, particularly his friend James Bosgrave. In January 1585 Bosgrave and twenty-one others imprisoned for religious reasons were released and shipped into exile. Back in Poland, Bosgrave returned to Vilna. But his health was not good and he moved to Braniewo and then to Pozna&#324; where he taught Hebrew and mathematics. He died in Kalisz on 27 October 1623.<br>
