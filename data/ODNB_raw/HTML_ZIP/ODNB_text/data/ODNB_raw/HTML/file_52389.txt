<span class="headword">Sidgwick,  Rose</span>  (1877&#150;1918), <span class="occ">university teacher</span>, was born at 13 Bilton Road, Rugby, Warwickshire, on 9 January 1877, the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48597/', "Arthur Sidgwick (1840&#150;1920)")</script> and his wife, Charlotte Sophia Wilson (1853&#150;1924). Her father, an assistant master at Rugby School, became a classical tutor at Oxford, where he was a strong supporter of the movement for women's higher education. Her uncle was the Cambridge philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25517/', "Henry Sidgwick")</script>, and his wife, Eleanor Sidgwick, became principal of Newnham College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Rose therefore grew up in a circle not only of academic distinction but of involvement in educational, social, and religious issues. On leaving Oxford high school she remained at home in north Oxford, registering with the Society of Oxford Home Students (which in 1952 became St Anne's College), and gaining first-class honours in modern history in 1899. She took as her first post a lectureship at the Oxford Pupil Teacher's Centre, and in 1903 she was awarded the Oxford diploma in education with distinction. She then became for a year a temporary tutor in history at Somerville College, where the impressive library building, designed by Champneys, was nearing completion. Rose helped Margery Fry, the librarian, to arrange the books, and when Margery left to become warden of a small residence for women students at Birmingham, Rose became librarian, receiving among other gifts 2000 volumes from the library of John Stuart Mill.<br>
<br>In 1905 Rose Sidgwick obtained a lectureship in history at Birmingham University. She joined Margery at the Hagley Road Women's Residence, which moved in 1908 to new premises, University House, in Edgbaston. The friendship was deeply emotional on Rose's side, as happened at a time when academic life for women had become almost exclusively celibate. Early in her life at Birmingham, however, she composed for herself &#145;a New Decalogue&#146;; the first line was &#145;Thou shalt not cling, thou shalt not clutch&#146;. The friendship was invaluable to both women: Rose found Margery &#145;a kind of spiritual sea-side&#146; but Margery's mind, sternly nurtured by her father and brother, was widened by Rose's feminine culture. Rose's sister Ethel Sidgwick had published her first novel in 1910: a collection of Rose's verse was published posthumously, <span class="italic">Writings by R. S.</span> (1920).<br>
<br>Rose Sidgwick was above all a teacher, at a time when universities did not demand research and publication. The records of her twelve-year lectureship are scanty. She was an enthusiastic supporter of the Workers' Educational Association, founded in 1903. She joined Margery Fry on the Staffordshire education committee. In 1914 University House, the fine building which Rose had seen built and helped to plan, was commandeered as a military hospital. The students were temporarily housed, and Margery and Rose rented a house: they bought furnishings from Roger Fry's Omega Workshop in Bloomsbury. For several months the house was lent to Belgian refugees. Margery left to organize relief work with British Quakers in the Marne: Rose joined her in vacations.<br>
<br>In 1918 Rose Sidgwick took Margery Fry's place on the British Universities Mission to the USA. She was a great success, &#145;the master-bowman of the group&#146; said Sir Henry Jones, professor of philosophy at Glasgow. She died at New York of the influenza that was sweeping through Europe and North America on 28 December 1918, while on the homeward journey. Alumnae of all the American universities she had visited founded the Rose Sidgwick memorial scholarship to enable a British woman graduate to study in an American university  (<span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, 19 June 1919, 308).<br>
<br>Rose Sidgwick was forty-one when she died, young in appearance and fresh in mind according to Margery Fry, who recalled &#145;her gentle and dignified manner with its slight but ineradicable touch of the academic&#146;  (Fry, 136). People spoke of the sweetness of her nature, as they had of her uncle, Henry Sidgwick. Like him, she had an indestructible faith in some form of personal survival, though she had grown up among people who wanted to apply the tests of reason and science to religion. She sometimes found their iconoclasm hard to bear. Her own religion seems to have been a Wordsworthian natural piety.<br>
