<span class="headword">Fenwicke,  George</span>  (1689&#150;1760), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 11 December 1689 at Hallaton, Leicestershire, son of William Fenwicke (<i>d</i>. 1750), successively rector of Thakeham, Sussex, and of Hallaton and Carlton Curlieu in Leicestershire, and his wife, Cecily, daughter of Gilbert Coles, rector of Easton, Hampshire. He was educated at Winchester College and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1705 and proceeded BA in 1709, MA in 1712, and BD in 1720. He was elected a fellow of St John's in 1710 but gave up his fellowship in 1722 on becoming rector of Hallaton, on the resignation of his father. Ordained deacon by the bishop of London in 1712 he was priested by the bishop of Lincoln in 1713.<br>
<br>Fenwicke's <span class="italic">Thoughts upon the Hebrew Titles of the Psalms</span> (1749) and <span class="italic">The psalter in its original form, or, The book of Psalms reduced to lines in an easy and familiar style and a kind of blank verse of unequal measure</span> (1759) showed that he was an able Hebraist. He quoted the distinguished Hebrew scholar Robert Lowth, provided explanatory notes, and gave variant readings. He published two devotional manuals, <span class="italic">Help for the Sincere, in Plain Meditations</span> (1737) and <span class="italic">A manual for the devout: consisting of devotions for ordinary occasions and for the holy communion: taken chiefly from Bishop Andrewes, and Bishop Taylor, and fitted for the general use</span> (n.d.). He also published two sermons.<br>
<br>Fenwicke married three times. His first wife was Mary, daughter of the Revd Nichol of Preston Capes, Northamptonshire, and she died on 8 August 1726. His second wife, Alice, daughter of John Hickman of Malpas, Cheshire, died on 5 January 1738. Fenwicke had two sons with Alice: George, who died in 1750, and John, who succeeded his father as rector of Hallaton. A third marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of the Revd John Yates, rector of Ayston, Rutland, and widow of Thomas White of Ayston, ended with her death on 3 January 1754.<br>
<br>Fenwicke gave sets of communion silver to Hallaton church and to its chapelry of Blaston, each piece inscribed &#145;All for the love of Jesus&#146;. With a bequest from a Mrs Parker he established an almshouse in Hallaton to house three poor old women or men of the parish, and he himself bequeathed two houses and some land, the income to be devoted to the rector of Hallaton, the poor of the parish, and the school. Fenwicke died on 10 April 1760 and was commemorated by a monument outside the chancel of Hallaton church, where he was buried.<br>
