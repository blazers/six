<span class="headword">Trotman,  Alexander James <span class="st"> [Alex]</span></span>, Baron Trotman  (1933&#150;2005), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born at 30 Twickenham Road, Isleworth, Middlesex, on 22 July 1933, the son of Charles Arthur Trotman, stoker, and later upholsterer, and his wife, Agnes Smith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson. At the time of his birth registration his parents lived at 12 Beaconsfield Road, east Twickenham, but they later moved to Edinburgh, where Trotman attended Boroughmuir high school and acquired his lifelong Scottish accent. After completing his secondary school education he joined the Royal Air Force as a national serviceman and served as a navigator, with the rank of flying officer. While in the RAF he married, at the Wesley Methodist Chapel, Brompton, on 22 January 1955, Lorna Fletcher, a 21-year-old GPO telephonist from the village of Brompton, near Northallerton in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and daughter of John James Fletcher, a bricklayer's labourer. The marriage was later dissolved and in 1963 Trotman married his second wife, Valerie Anne. In all he had four children. No mention was made of either wives or children (or recreations) in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> and <span class="italic">Burke's Peerage</span> entries.<br>
<br>On leaving the RAF Trotman joined the Ford Motor Company at Dagenham. He built his early career in the purchasing department, where he was charged with the task of chasing deliveries of components for the Ford Consul. This was followed in 1961 by his appointment as chief product analyst on the Archbishop project, which resulted in the production of the Cortina model, of which more than three million were sold. Such success caught the attention of Henry Ford, and in 1967 came an elevation to chief product planning director for Ford Europe, with the objective of bringing about greater co-ordination between Ford's British and German operations.<br>
<br>Trotman harboured a desire to work in the company's American arena, but found that it was impossible to transfer across the Atlantic. In consequence he resigned his position in Europe and, after paying his own fare to America, applied for and got a post at Dearborn, Michigan, in 1969, though initially at less than his British salary. In 1972 he gained an MBA from Michigan State University. He become chief car planning manager in 1975 before returning to Europe as vice-president of Ford's truck operations in 1979. Four years later he took up the post of president of Ford's Asia Pacific region. Based in Melbourne, Australia, he faced strong Japanese competition, especially from Toyota and Honda, but succeeded in making Ford the Australian market leader within a year. His success did not go unnoticed and in 1984 he was recalled to Europe as chairman of Ford Europe, where his chief challenge lay in raising productivity levels in Britain to those in Germany. He returned to the United States in 1989 as vice-president of the company, in charge of all North American operations. Success with cars such as the Taurus and the Mercury Sable led to his being appointed chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company in 1993.<br>
<br>Trotman's tenure in office lasted five years, during which he set about trying to transform a group of regional organizations into a global company through the Ford 2000 project, to bring about higher levels of integration. Hitherto the European and American plants had had little to do with each other, each producing models with their own suppliers and model-specific technical specifications. Crucial to Trotman's plan was the standardization of components across as many models as possible to reduce costs by economies of scale in purchasing and production on a global scale, while leaving branding and marketing targeted at specific consumers. Also central to his plan was making the European operation responsible for the design and production of small and medium-sized models like the Mondeo, with the American counterpart taking responsibility for large cars and sports utility vehicles. Though traditionally Ford had always sourced all its component parts from within, Ford 2000 was to break this mould too. Internal suppliers such as Visteon were spun off and told to compete in the wider market, with other remaining internal firms being forced to compete for the first time with outsiders for contracts. This strategy generated massive savings in costs of $5 billion in 1995 alone and went a considerable way towards restoring Ford's short-term profitability. Nevertheless, a degree of tension was created within Ford owing to the way in which the programme was implemented. There were two camps on Ford's board. The first favoured rapid implementation and the second a more incremental approach. Trotman backed the former and started by getting rid of 15 per cent of senior management as well as a considerable number of middle managers in order to reduce administration costs.<br>
<br>Trotman portrayed his Ford 2000 strategy as one that would release chaotic creativity. The eventual outcome was rather different. Not all models created were successful when sold across markets. The European-designed Mondeo sold well in Europe, but its American variants, the Contour and the Mercury Mystique, both failed to make a significant impact. Perhaps critics were correct in their assertion that the European and North American markets were quite distinct and should be treated as discrete entities. A further outcome of the Detroit-driven policy was that Ford Europe felt it had lost its autonomy and its executives appear to have suffered considerable demoralization. Eventually in 1998 the tensions caused by Ford 2000 were such that Trotman was invited to step aside as chairman in favour of William Clay Ford, Henry's grandson, and as chief executive by Jac Nasser.<br>
<br>In essence Trotman was a visionary, who foresaw correctly that globalization was inevitable in the automotive industry and tried to meet the challenges it presented. He was knighted in 1996, and made a life peer in 1999, the year in which he led an inquiry into small businesses on behalf of the British government. With homes in Florida and north Yorkshire, he was a member of the board of directors of the IBM Corporation (1995&#150;2005) and of the New York stock exchange (1996&#150;2002), while also a non-executive director of ICI (1997&#150;2003) and its chairman from 2002 to 2003. He was president of the Hakluyt Foundation from 2002. He died of leukaemia on 25 April 2005, at the Friarage Hospital, Northallerton, Yorkshire. He was survived by his wife, Valerie, and his four children.<br>
