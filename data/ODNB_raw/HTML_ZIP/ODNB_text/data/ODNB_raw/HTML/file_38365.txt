<span class="headword">Hourani,  Albert Habib</span>  (1915&#150;1993), <span class="occ">historian and Arabist</span>, was born on 31 March 1915 in Didsbury, south Manchester, the fifth of the six children of Fadlo Hourani (1871&#150;1960), a textile exporter, and his wife, Soumaiya (1881&#150;1943), daughter of the Revd Yuakim and Khazma Racy. His parents were both born in Marj &#146;Ayyun in what is now south Lebanon and his father emigrated to England in 1891.<br>
<br>Hourani was educated at a primary school founded by his father and at Mill Hill School. He won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1933 where he obtained a first in philosophy, politics, and economics. After graduation in 1936 he used a small grant from the college to visit Lebanon where he obtained a job teaching British and Middle Eastern history at the American University of Beirut.<br>
<br>Returning home in 1939, Hourani was recruited to the newly organized Foreign Office research department run by Arnold Toynbee and Hamilton Gibb. He was sent to the Middle East in 1942 on a mission which culminated in his official report, &#145;Great Britain and Arab nationalism&#146; (1943). In 1943 he became assistant adviser on Arab affairs to the British minister of state resident in Cairo, writing a series of papers which later formed part of his first two books, <span class="italic">Syria and Lebanon: a Political Essay</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Minorities in the Arab World</span> (1947). The ambivalence which he felt towards the Arab nationalism of that period and his firsthand experience of the key role played by influential urban families in Arab politics remained important themes throughout his scholarly life.<br>
<br>In November 1945 Hourani joined the Jerusalem section of the Arab office, which had been set up to promote the Palestine Arab case. He testified with great skill before the Anglo-American committee of inquiry in February 1946. He did similar work for the Arab office in London from May 1946 to June 1947 before resigning on the grounds that he found this type of political propaganda uncongenial.<br>
<br>At the encouragement of Hamilton Gibb, Hourani returned to Oxford in early 1948 as a research fellow at Magdalen College and then, in 1951, as the university's first lecturer in the modern history of the Middle East. He continued to write on contemporary Middle Eastern affairs in articles and reviews which were sometimes sharply critical of what he took to be ill-informed official prejudice about the Arab people, notably his &#145;The decline of the West in the Middle East&#146; (<span class="italic">International Affairs</span>, 1953). But after one last trenchant piece looking at the Suez affair from the perspective of declining imperial power, &#145;The Middle East and the crisis of 1956&#146; (1958), he deliberately confined himself to historical themes and, in particular, to the impact of modern Europe on certain leading Arab thinkers, published as <span class="italic">Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age</span> (1962). This was a pioneering work which opened up many new areas for academic research.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s Hourani converted to Roman Catholicism. In February 1955 he married Christine Mary Odile Wegg-Prosser (<i>b</i>. 1914), an antiques restorer; they had one daughter, Susanna (<i>b</i>. 1956). Hourani moved to St Antony's College, Oxford, in 1958 as the second director of its newly created Middle East Centre. He was immediately drawn into an energetic period of institution building, using the government funds recommended by the Hayter committee report to place modern Middle Eastern studies on a firm basis with the establishment of eight new posts. The intelligent guidance which he exercised over this whole process, the intellectual frameworks he established for examining what was still a fledgeling field, and his patient supervision of a growing number of graduate students soon made Oxford one of the premier Middle East centres in the world. Of particular importance were his ability to open up the older, orientalist, approach to insights from the work of the important social scientists he encountered during two visits to the University of Chicago in 1962 and 1963 and to reach out to European scholars, particularly in France and Germany. First fruits of this can be seen in his influential article &#145;The politics of the notables&#146; (1966), and in his leadership of the Oxford Near East History Group and its series of international symposia beginning with &#145;The Islamic city&#146; (1965).<br>
<br>Hourani resigned as director of the St Antony's Middle East Centre in 1971 and as university reader in Middle East history in 1980. This gave him more time to write and also to do what he enjoyed best, teaching and advising graduate students in Britain, the United States (particularly at Harvard), and Europe. He remained unusually open to the ideas of his younger colleagues and was always willing to share his own thoughts with them. At first meeting, many seemed in awe of a man who acted with a dignified old-fashioned courtesy and who was so knowledgeable and well read. But they were soon put at their ease by his warmth and interest and by the skill with which he and his wife, Odile, were able to make visitors feel welcome and at home.<br>
<br>Hourani published two collections of essays, <span class="italic">Europe and the Middle East</span> (1980) and <span class="italic">The Emergence of the Middle East</span> (1981). These contain many of the seminal works by which he was best known, notably &#145;Islam and the philosophers of history&#146; in which he sets out several themes later developed by Edward Said in <span class="italic">Orientalism</span> (1979), &#145;Ideologies of the mountain and city: reflections on the Lebanese civil war&#146;, and his very personal memoir, &#145;H. A. R. Gibb: the vocation of an orientalist&#146;.<br>
<br>It was a source of much discomfort to Hourani that he was unable to complete a major work on the Arab provinces of the Ottoman empire which had been commissioned in the 1950s. Nevertheless, he eventually found a satisfactory way of writing general history based on an emphasis on the central importance of notable politics and the agro-city, first unveiled as a research agenda in 1976, and then used to structure his highly successful <span class="italic">A History of the Arab Peoples</span> (1991).<br>
<br>Hourani was appointed CBE in 1980. He and his wife moved to London in 1984. In 1988 he delivered the Tanner lectures at Cambridge University, later published as <span class="italic">Islam in European Thought</span> (1991). He took obvious pleasure in the enthusiastic reception accorded to <span class="italic">A History of the Arab Peoples</span>, which appeared at a time of great public interest in the Middle East during the Gulf crisis of 1990&#150;91. He continued to write and meet students until two days before his death in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 17 January 1993. He was cremated at Oxford crematorium on 25 January.<br>
