<span class="headword">O'Halloran, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1763&#150;1843), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, youngest son of the surgeon and antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20628/', "Sylvester O'Halloran (1728&#150;1807)")</script> and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Casey (<i>d</i>. 1782), was born in co. Limerick on 13 August 1763. He was appointed midshipman on the East India Company's sloop of war <i>Swallow</i> on 22 February 1781, and in July obtained an infantry cadetship; he was made ensign in the Bengal army on 9 May 1782 and lieutenant on 6 January 1785. He married in 1790 Frances (1773&#150;1835), daughter of Colonel Nicholas Bayly MP, of Redhill, Surrey, of the 1st foot guards, brother of the first earl of Uxbridge, and they had a large family. Their second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20629/', "Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran (1797&#150;1870)")</script>.<br>
<br>On 7 January 1796 O'Halloran became captain, and from June 1796 to October 1802 was adjutant and quartermaster at Midnapore, and was attached to the public works department. On the abolition of his office he rejoined his unit, the 18th Bengal native infantry. In September 1803 he accompanied a force which crossed the Jumna to subjugate Bundelkhand, and on 12 October defeated a force of 15,000 Marathas at Kopsah. His gallantry at the sieges of Bursaar and Jeswarree in January 1804 led to his appointment to supervise the operations of an irregular force of 2000 men, under Sheikh Kurub Ali, in the interior of Bundelkhand. On 15 May he attacked and defeated, after a determined resistance, Raja Ram and 10,000 Bundelas entrenched among the rocks and hills of Mahaba. On 1 July he commanded two brigades of irregulars in another attack on Raja Ram and a force of 16,000 Bundelas and Nagas on the fortified hills of Thana and Purswarree. Subsequently he served at the siege of Saitpur, and in December attacked and stormed several other towns and forts. In January 1805 he captured the forts of Niagacre and Dowra, in Pinwarree. His services were noticed by the Marquess Wellesley.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1805 O'Halloran was appointed commissary of supplies by Lord Lake. On the breaking up of the army on 1 June 1806 he rejoined his regiment, and on 25 April 1808 attained the rank of major. He commanded the attack on the strongly fortified hill of Rogoulee, in Bundelkhand, on 22 January 1809. Colonel Martindell, who commanded in Bundelkhand, made O'Halloran his military secretary, and his conduct at the head of the 1st battalion 18th native infantry at the siege of the fortress of Ajaigarh was specially noticed. He became lieutenant-colonel on 4 June 1814, served in the campaigns against the Nepalese in 1815 and 1816, in the first campaign covering the district of Tirhut, in the second at the siege of Harriharpur, and afterwards commanded his battalion in Cuttack during the disturbances there. For his services he was made CB. In August 1818 he was sent to join the 1st battalion 20th native infantry in the Straits Settlements, and on arrival there was appointed commandant of the 25th Bengal native infantry. In January 1825 he was appointed brigadier at Barrackpore. Before leaving he received the thanks of the government of the Straits Settlements, and the unusual honour of an eleven-gun embarkation salute. In December 1828 he became brigadier-general, and was appointed to the Saugor division. He became colonel of a regiment on 4 June 1829. With the expiration of his five years' period of staff service, on 23 December 1833, ended his active military career of fifty-three years, during which he had never taken any leave to Europe.<br>
<br>O'Halloran landed in England in May 1834. In February 1835 he was knighted by William IV, who observed that the distinction was well earned by his long meritorious and gallant services, and by his consecration of his eight sons to the service of his country. O'Halloran became major-general on 10 January 1837. He was made KCB in 1837, and GCB in 1841. He became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland in 1836, an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1838, and received the freedom of his native city (Limerick) on 25 February 1838. He died at his residence, 42 Connaught Square, Hyde Park, London, on 3 November 1843, from the effects of a street accident in which the neck of his thigh-bone was fractured. He was buried in the catacombs at Kensal Green cemetery, Middlesex, immediately beneath the chapel. A memorial tablet was placed in the wall of the south cloister.<br>
<br>O'Halloran's sixth son, <a name="cosubject_20630"></a><span class="headword">William Littlejohn O'Halloran</span>  (1806&#150;1885), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Berhampore, India, on 5 May 1806, went to England in 1811. On 11 January 1824 he was commissioned ensign in the 14th foot, which he joined at Meerut. He served with it at the siege and storm of Bharatpur in 1825&#150;6, obtaining his lieutenancy in action. In April 1827 he exchanged into the 38th regiment, and served on the staff of his father at Saugor, central India. He married in December 1831 Eliza Minton, daughter of John Montague Smyth. O'Halloran was employed on recruiting service in Belfast from 1832 to 1834. In 1834 he embarked for Sydney with a detachment of the 50th. From there he sailed for Calcutta, rejoined the 38th at Chinsura in 1835, and accompanied it to England in 1836. He obtained his company by purchase on 29 December 1837, and retired from the army in April 1840.<br>
<br>O'Halloran then embarked for South Australia, landed at Glenelg on 11 August 1840, and purchased a property near Adelaide. In August 1841 he was appointed a justice of the peace, in March 1843 a member of the board of audit, in June 1843 private secretary to Governor Grey and clerk of the councils, and in January 1851 auditor-general of South Australia. In 1866 he acted as chairman of a commission into the administration of the Northern Territory. On 22 January 1868 he retired, after serving the colonial government for upwards of twenty-four years. He died at Adelaide, South Australia, on 15 July 1885. He left two daughters and three sons, the eldest of whom, Joseph Sylvester O'Halloran CMG, became secretary to the Royal Colonial Institute in 1884.<br>
