<span class="headword">Solly,  Henry</span>  (1813&#150;1903), <span class="occ">social reformer and founder of working men's clubs</span>, was born on 17 November 1813 in the City of London, the youngest of the ten children of Isaac Solly (1768&#150;1853), a trader and company director, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of John Harrison, a London solicitor. His father was descended from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19817/', "Daniel Neal")</script>, the historian of the puritans. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25989/', "Samuel Solly")</script> was his elder brother. The Sollys were religious dissenters, closely associated with the English Presbyterian meeting-houses at Walthamstow and Hackney. Henry was educated by the nonconformist minister Eliezer Cogan (1762&#150;1855) and then in Brighton under Dr John Morell. Solly was one of the first students to be admitted to the nondenominational University College, London, which he attended from 1829 to 1831.<br>
<br>A career in commerce proved uncongenial, and on the advice of the Unitarian minister Robert Aspland in 1840 Solly briefly attended the General Baptist Academy under Revd Benjamin Mardon. This decision was taken in the light of his father's financial ruin in 1837, an occurrence which had far-reaching effects. Unable afterwards to rely on family money, the search for regular income was a dominant factor in his career. Solly entered the ministry of the Unitarian chapel at Yeovil in 1840, though he always disliked the Unitarian label. He came into contact with workers, especially in the glove factories, which made him sympathetic to Chartism, and he was one of the two dissenting ministers who served as a representative (for Yeovil) at the Birmingham Chartist conference of 1842. His novel, <span class="italic">James Woodford, Carpenter and Chartist</span> (1881), embodies his experiences at this time.<br>
<br>On 22 April 1841 Solly married his cousin, Rebecca (1812&#150;1893), the daughter of Samuel Shaen, a barrister and landowner of Crix, Essex, at the Presbyterian chapel of High Street, Stourbridge. She loyally supported her husband whatever the financial consequences, and they had one son and four daughters.<br>
<br>Solly became a strong advocate of, and activist in, radical causes: universal suffrage and education, anti-corn law agitation, the co-operative movement, early closing for shops and Sunday opening of museums, anti-slavery, and much else. This commitment to radicalism did not endear him to the leaders of Unitarian congregations. He was forced out of Yeovil in 1842, and had a succession of short-term pastorates at Tavistock (1842&#150;4), Shepton Mallet (1844&#150;7), Cheltenham (1847&#150;51), Carter Lane, London (1852&#150;7), and Lancaster (1858&#150;62). At the end of his London ministry, Solly concluded: &#145;I could not help feeling that my London pastorate, and work there generally, had been rather a failure, and the back of my life at five and forty seemed broken&#146;  (Solly, <span class="italic">These Eighty Years</span>, 2.140). He never held a pastorate again in any denomination.<br>
<br>Solly returned to London in 1862 with little money and little hope of a pulpit. However the twenty years which followed showed him to be one of the most remarkable social innovators of his time. As William Beveridge, the architect of the welfare state, put it: &#145;He was a restless, inventive, constructive spirit, part author of at least three large living movements; charity organisation, working men's clubs, and garden cities&#146;  (Beveridge, 170). Solly was not a socialist, however, and saw himself as a gentleman. He believed in the class order of British society, but was involved in almost every radical initiative to benefit the working class. He formed numerous associations with this aim, the majority of which failed soon after their creation. The centres of his concern were the condition of the respectable working classes and the fostering of a sense of fellowship between the classes. These he expressed in the Working Men's Club and Institute Union, which was founded in London, chiefly at his initiative, on 14 June 1862; he became its first paid secretary in 1863. An ardent teetotaller, Solly became convinced when at Lancaster that working men needed clubs for recreational purposes. Travelling incessantly, he created clubs all over the country and it was soon a genuinely national organization. An excellent organizer and fund-raiser, the movement he created soon became an established part of British life. His infectious enthusiasm led Henry Fawcett to state: &#145;Here is Henry Solly, who thinks heaven will be composed of Working Men's Clubs&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, 7 March 1903). Despite his success in establishing the club movement, his flamboyant and domineering style, along with his insistence that the clubs should maintain a high moral tone, soon led to trouble. He was first forced out in 1867, but returned a few years later only to sever finally the connection with his creation in 1873 following disputes about his salary and the sale of alcohol in the clubs.<br>
<br>Turning next to the indigent element in society, Solly was chiefly instrumental in creating the Charity Organization Society (COS) in 1869. Thrift was at the heart of the doctrine of self-help that was pressed on the Victorian working man. However &#145;ultimately self-help and charity might be in conflict &hellip; the 1860s were inspired with the belief that the poor could be helped, by intelligent charity, to help themselves&#146;  (C. L. Mowat, <span class="italic">The Charity Organisation Society 1869&#150;1913</span>, 1961, 14). Solly in his usual practical style set out this opportunity in a well-attended public lecture which he gave in 1868 that proved to be a trumpet call for action. The London Association for the Prevention of Pauperism and Crime was in operation by November the same year, and from this the COS was formed.<br>
<br>The society's central doctrine was the high responsibility which it attached particularly to the spending of charitable money, and the need to accompany it with personal care. Serving as its first secretary and guiding force, Solly helped the society become a leading body in the administration of charity in London, and the promotion of social casework throughout Britain. Once again, Solly's insistence on more money for himself and control over the organization resulted in his being ousted from the COS.<br>
<br>In the belief that artisans should be well housed, Solly's last initiative was to set up the Society for the Promotion of Industrial Villages in 1884. This venture soon failed, but the novel idea was later considered to have been an important precursor of the work of Sir Ebenezer Howard in the so-called Garden City movement. &#145;This Society was the last of my forlorn attempts to promote social reforms by means of an organised association, and I mean it to be the last; for which those friends who have helped me, and those whom I have also worried but who have not helped me, will be devoutly thankful&#146;  (Solly, <span class="italic">These Eighty Years</span>, 2.566).<br>
<br>Solly wrote and lectured extensively on numerous subjects, often in a provocative way in order to engage as many people as possible in support of his causes. He had a tempestuous period as joint editor, with the trade unionist George Potter, of <span class="italic">The Beehive</span> from 1869 to 1870. He was always an earnest enthusiast, impatient and difficult to deal with except on his own terms. He cheerfully and vigorously forced himself and his causes before the attention of the great and the good. To the distress of his family, later in life he rejected the Unitarian name but not the ministerial title, although others, as he admitted, &#145;only saw [him] as a Unitarian minister&#146;  (Solly, <span class="italic">These Eighty Years</span>, 2.504). His grandson, J. H. Wicksteed, who followed his father as a Unitarian minister, wrote of Henry: &#145;to him, wrong and suffering were not symptoms of false ideas, but definite evils to be fought with and removed now and on the spot&#146;  (Wicksteed, 5).<br>
<br>Solly's vision and obstinate determination led him to found social organizations well in advance of their time. These same qualities, however, rendered him unfit and unable to stay with them and develop their potential, and by 1900 he was a forgotten figure. Solly died of a brain haemorrhage on 27 February 1903 at Childrey, near Wantage, Berkshire, at the home of his daughter and son-in-law, the Revd Philip Wicksteed, with whom he felt a great affinity; he was buried in Childrey churchyard on 4 March. Solly lived long beyond his time but some belated recognition came with his death. The then secretary of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union (B. T. Hall) aptly wrote in 1904: &#145;If the work that the Clubs do, if their influence on personal character and their contribution to the sum total of human happiness be correctly appreciated &hellip; then shall the investigator reckon Henry Solly amongst the constructive statesmen of our time&#146;  (Wicksteed, 214).<br>
