<span class="headword">Clubbe,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1703&#150;1773), <span class="occ">satirist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was one of the sons of the Revd George Clubbe (<i>d</i>. 1711), rector of Whatfield, Suffolk. Clubbe entered King's College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1721, and took his BA in 1725. Ordained deacon in September of the same year, he was priested two years later. His subsequent clerical career was unexciting: vicar of St Clement's, Ipswich (1729), vicar of Debenham, Suffolk (1730), and rector of Whatfield (1735). (Whatfield had been held by his father from 1703 until his death in 1711.)<br>
<br>Clubbe's most impressive work was the anonymously published <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the Ancient Villa of Wheatfield</span> (1758). Ostensibly aimed at Philip Morant's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of &hellip; Colchester</span> (1738), Clubbe's main target was, in fact, a whole genre of contemporary writing. Clubbe burlesqued the solemn self-importance of Georgian local historians and topographers: &#145;The ancient villa or parish of Wheatfield lies in the South-west part of the county of Suffolk, in the 52d Degree, 12 minutes of Northern Latitude, and distant from London 66 miles&#146;  (Clubbe, <span class="italic">History</span>, 15). He also poked delicious fun at prim morality. Viewing the classical &#145;Scamna or Benches&#146; in the parsonage garden at Whatfield, he noted that they used to have on them &#145;many imperfect Letters and Words &hellip; which more than hint to us that [the] obscene God Priapus had a Statue erected to him in one of the Fruit Quarters&#146;  (ibid., 19). The offending words, Clubbe assures the reader, have been removed by the current rector.<br>
<br>Clubbe's other works&#151;all of them ephemeral&#151;were published in two volumes of <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts</span> (1770). The best of these was &#145;A letter of free advice to a young clergyman&#146;. Ahead of its time, &#145;A letter&#146; breathed a spirit of real social sensitivity and concern: &#145;carry not a rich man into the church, and read over him the whole burial service, and huddle a poor man into his grave with a small portion of it&#146;  (Clubbe, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts</span>, 2.27). Clubbe married Susannah Beeston on 8 August 1732. He had twelve children, eight of whom survived him. Among the survivors were John Clubbe, an Ipswich physician, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5722/', "William Clubbe (bap. 1745, d. 1814)")</script>, a cleric and poet.<br>
<br>Clubbe kept his sense of humour to the end. The night before his death he was visited by his doctor, who remarked that his pulse was much more even than it had been on his last visit. &#145;My dear friend, if you do not already know, or have not a technical expression for it, I will tell you what it beats&#151;it beats <i>the Dead March</i>&#146;  (Nichols, 2.378). Clubbe died on 2 March 1773; his wife survived him.<br>
