<span class="headword">Escures,  Ralph  d'</span>  (<em>c.</em>1068&#150;1122), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was the son of Seffrid d'Escures and his first wife, Rascendis. The alternative name de Turbine sometimes attached to him is not recorded before the fourteenth century, and may have originated in a confusion with his successor at Canterbury, William de Corbeil.<h2>
<a name="Monkandabbot"></a>Monk and abbot</h2>Seffrid, whose name suggests kinship with the lords of Bell&ecirc;me, held extensive lands in the neighbourhood of Alen&ccedil;on, from which he made substantial grants to the abbey of St Martin of S&eacute;es, a daughter house of St Evroult founded by Roger de Montgomery, vicomte of the Hi&egrave;mois, and his wife, Mabel, heir of Bell&ecirc;me; many years later Seffrid died at St Martin's in the monastic habit. Ralph entered the house about 1078, when according to later tradition he was ten years old, and rose to be sub-prior, and then in 1088 prior. In 1089 he became the house's second abbot. He was to hold office under increasingly difficult circumstances for sixteen years. He clearly owed his promotion to more than family influence, for there is remarkable unanimity among contemporaries on his learning and affability. For some time the house prospered. Roger de Montgomery had already taken monks from St Martin's to found a substantial monastery at Shrewsbury about 1083, and in Ralph's time Montgomery's family made extensive further grants of S&eacute;es, notably in the lordship of Pembroke and Lancashire. In 1094 S&eacute;es also profited from Robert de Bell&ecirc;me's war with Robert Giroie, since part of the former's booty was the arm of St C&eacute;neri, which was taken to St Martin. In the meantime, the links between S&eacute;es and its mother house remained strong, and Ralph became a close friend of Roger du Sap, abbot of St Evroult from 1091. Many years later Jean de Rheims dedicated his life of St Evroult (now lost) to Ralph, who is described by Orderic Vitalis as very well versed in letters, eloquent, agreeable, and universally beloved.<br>
<br>The death of William Rufus in 1100 was disastrous for St Martin and its abbot. In 1102 Abbot Ralph was in England when Robert de Bell&ecirc;me and his brothers rose against Henry I&#151;after the fall of Bridgnorth the men of Shrewsbury sent Ralph to the king with the keys to the fortress. Count Robert forfeited his English lands and returned to Normandy, bent on creating a near independent lordship based on Bell&ecirc;me. The demands he made on S&eacute;es, already heavy, became intolerable, and by 1104 both Bishop Martin of S&eacute;es and Abbot Ralph had fled to the protection of King Henry of England. According to William of Malmesbury, England was then full of such exiles, but Ralph was set apart by his unwillingness to burden any of his hosts with too long or exacting a stay. His first documented appearance was at Durham that September, to attend the translation of St Cuthbert to the new cathedral. When doubt was cast on the survival of the saint's uncorrupted body, Abbot Ralph made peace between the contending parties, and himself carried out a detailed examination of the body before proclaiming it as perfect as on the day of death. In 1106 Ralph was at least for a while back in Normandy, where he visited his old acquaintance, Archbishop Anselm, at Bec; he had probably ceased to exercise authority at S&eacute;es by this date, although the sources unanimously refer to him as abbot until 1108, and his successor was not elected until 1110.<h2>
<a name="BishopofRochester"></a>Bishop of Rochester</h2>When Anselm returned to England in 1107 Ralph seems to have attached himself chiefly to the archbishop's household. Certainly he became familiar with the monks of Christ Church, and he came to visit his friend Bishop Gundulf of Rochester in March 1108 as he lay dying. With prophetic foresight Gundulf gave Ralph his episcopal ring. Since Lanfranc's time, at least, the bishopric of Rochester had been recognized as in the archbishop's gift, and on 29 June, Anselm nominated Ralph to the bishopric and took his homage. The next day he was sent to Rochester with the sub-prior of Canterbury and the archdeacon, who invested him with the bishopric. Ralph was consecrated by the archbishop of Canterbury on 9 August; his happy prognostic was &#145;They are as the angels which are in heaven&#146;  (<span class="roman">Mark</span> 12: 25).<br>
<br>The people of Rochester remembered Ralph as a friend to their church and liberties, and a handful of charters provide some support for this view. Otherwise he appears only rarely in the sources; late in 1108 he was sent to Southwell to command Thomas, archbishop-elect of York, to come to Canterbury for consecration and to make a profession of obedience, Ralph's first known involvement in the primacy debate which would cast a dark shadow over his later years. By now Anselm was clearly dying, and the next April, Ralph was at Canterbury for his last hours and burial. To the very end Anselm and the monks of Canterbury were preoccupied by the need to secure a profession from Thomas, following the wholly exceptional act of submission of one archbishop to another secured by Lanfranc from Thomas's uncle and predecessor in 1072. The canons of York were no less determined to cast off this humiliating subjection. As Canterbury's representative during a vacancy Ralph continued to press for Thomas's surrender. He also watched over the rights of Canterbury during the long vacancy that followed Anselm's death. It was probably as deputy for the archbishop that he consecrated the crypt chapel at Bury St Edmunds, and promoted Baldwin to the priorate, perhaps in 1112. There was little to indicate that he would soon be called to a much wider stage.<h2>
<a name="ElevationtoCanterbury"></a>Elevation to Canterbury</h2>After a five-year vacancy King Henry, pressed by the pope and the monks of Canterbury, at last took steps to appoint a new archbishop. In April 1114 he summoned his bishops and magnates to Windsor; Bishop Ralph accompanied the prior of Christ Church and a party of his monks, who had also been called. By then Ralph and the aged bishop of Norwich were the only monks among the bishops, and the remainder combined to oppose the king's own choice, Abbot Faricius of Abingdon, demanding a clerk of their own order as vigorously as the monks of Christ Church refused one. In this impasse Ralph emerged as the compromise candidate, a monk but at least a bishop, and of wonderful affability. Nominated on 26 April, and installed at Canterbury on 16 May, he secured his own replacement at Rochester by Abbot Ernulf of Peterborough, a former monk of Christ Church, whom he invested with the bishopric on 28 September. Emissaries set off for Rome late in the year to seek papal confirmation of Ralph's translation and a pallium. According to the letters of support for his election which they carried, the new archbishop was too infirm to make the journey himself, the first sign of the chronic ill health that was to dog his later years.<br>
<br>The ambassadors received at first an icy reception, since Pope Paschal II was already indignant at the reluctance of the English church to refer serious matters to his judgement and to render &#145;Peter's pence&#146;, and an episcopal translation without the previous consent of Rome was conceived as a particular affront. Only the intercession of Abbot Anselm of St Saba, nephew to the late archbishop, at length secured Pope Paschal's agreement, conveyed in letters of the most grudging assent of 30 March 1115. As legate, Abbot Anselm was charged with raising all these matters with the king, as well as with the pallium for Ralph. On 27 June he was received in procession at Canterbury by the archbishop, eight of his bishops, and the communities of Christ Church and St Augustine. Anselm laid the pallium in its silver casket on the high altar of the cathedral, the archbishop swore his oath of fidelity to the pope, and put on the pallium. After enthronement on the seat of St Augustine he proceeded immediately to consecrate Theulf as bishop of Worcester. Very shortly afterwards he appointed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95163/', "John")</script>, his sister's son, as his archdeacon.<h2>
<a name="ThedisputewithYorkdiplomaticendeavours"></a>The dispute with York: diplomatic endeavours</h2>The legate also bore a less welcome gift, a detailed requisitory of the pope's grievances against the English church, which he delivered to the king at his court at Westminster in September 1115. It came at a time when the entire Norman episcopate had been suspended for failing to attend a legatine council, and when Thurstan, the archbishop-elect of York, was refusing to make a profession of obedience to Canterbury, and was threatening to seek consecration from the pope. For his part, Ralph refused to consecrate Thurstan unless he professed, even if confronted by a papal command. It was agreed to send the blind but infinitely experienced Bishop William de Warelwast of Exeter to Rome to seek a resolution to these difficulties. A less urgent problem, over the place of consecration to the see of St David's of the queen's chancellor, Bernard, whom Ralph categorically refused to bless anywhere but at Canterbury, was more easily settled when King Henry arranged that Bernard should make his profession and receive Ralph's blessing at Westminster, the queen's favourite residence.<br>
<br>Late in the year Alexander, king of Scots, wrote to seek the archbishop's advice on finding a new bishop of St Andrews; Alexander's proposal that a new bishop should be consecrated at Canterbury rather than by the archbishop of York must have been extremely welcome, though nothing seems to have come of the proposal immediately. In March 1116 the archbishop was among those who swore allegiance to William &AElig;theling at Salisbury, an occasion that also saw the king compel Thurstan of York to renounce his see rather than profess to Canterbury, in spite of letters of powerful support from Pope Paschal. Shortly afterwards Thurstan crossed to Normandy to join the king, where he was allowed to resume his status as elect, and continued to press his case. In August, Abbot Anselm returned to Normandy with a new legatine commission for England, a clear indication of the failure of the mission of the bishop of Exeter. A council of English magnates therefore urged Ralph to travel to Rome to present his case, and in September he set out with a substantial company.<br>
<br>Still in Normandy, Ralph fell ill at La Fert&eacute; with an ulcer of the face, and for a month his life was despaired of. Further delayed by bad weather, the archbishop and his companions spent Christmas at Lyons. When they reached Rome in March, it was to find the city under assault from the emperor Heinrich V, while the pope had fled to Benevento. The archbishop nevertheless celebrated mass in St Peter's on 12 March, but could communicate with the pope only through messengers, who secured no more than empty courtesy. On the other hand, Thurstan's representatives received unequivocal papal support. Apparently with Paschal's consent, Ralph spent eight days with the emperor, but it became increasingly clear that the rumours of the pope's imminent return to Rome were baseless. By the end of the year Ralph was back at Rouen after much fruitless suffering.<br>
<br>On hearing of the death of Pope Paschal in January 1118, Thurstan left York and joined the king in Normandy, armed with papal letters commanding Ralph to consecrate him without a profession, and hoping for equally determined support from Paschal's successor. Ralph remained with the king, partly no doubt to strengthen the king's resolve to require a profession, partly because the legate Anselm still awaited the king's leave to cross to England to exercise his legation, partly perhaps in the hope that a new pope would be more sympathetic. In September he attended an important royal council at Rouen, where the legate Cono denounced the imperial antipope, and the king took counsel on the war raging along the Norman frontier. The new pope, Gelasius II, proved as staunch a friend to Thurstan as his predecessor, and wrote to Ralph in uncompromising terms commanding him to consecrate Thurstan without a profession, letters that Ralph would always insist he had never seen. Gelasius died suddenly in January 1119, but his successor, Calixtus II, proved no less insistent on Thurstan's rights. The state of war with France and Anjou, and the uncertainty over the pope's movements, yet again frustrated Ralph's attempts to go to plead his case in person, and though a messenger succeeded in delivering a letter of impassioned complaint, this received short shrift from Calixtus. In July (probably in 1119, rather than 1118), as the archbishop was taking off his vestments after mass, he suffered a severe stroke. He made a partial recovery, but his speech was permanently impaired, and his movement restricted; for some time, at least, he could only travel in a litter.<h2>
<a name="ThedisputewithYorkdefeatanddeath"></a>The dispute with York: defeat and death</h2>In May, Pope Calixtus had announced his intention of hearing the dispute between Canterbury and York at a council to be held at Rheims in October, to which Ralph and Thurstan were both summoned. A large delegation of English bishops set out, as did Thurstan, but Ralph was too ill, and Canterbury's case was chiefly represented by his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95131/', "Seffrid")</script>, shortly to become abbot of Glastonbury, and his nephew John, the archdeacon. In spite of their protests the pope consecrated Thurstan on 19 October, leaving the issue of the profession to be disputed elsewhere. The king, enraged by what he chose to represent as a breach of faith, forbade Thurstan to enter England and disseised him of his estates. On 4 January 1120, by contrast, Ralph was received with ceremony at Canterbury after an absence of three and a half years; on 4 April he was well enough to consecrate David as bishop of Bangor at Westminster. At this point King Alexander renewed his application for a new bishop of St Andrews, this time specifying Eadmer of Canterbury as his candidate. This was a choice that the archbishop could scarcely oppose, and Eadmer was sent off with the archbishop's blessing and King Henry's leave. Meanwhile, however, the pope's support for Thurstan was unwavering, and, faced by a threat of interdict, Henry submitted; at Christmas 1120 Ralph and the other bishops met the king at London and accepted defeat, at least for the moment. Thurstan returned to England and his church a few weeks later.<br>
<br>On 25 November 1120 the king's only legitimate son had drowned in the <i>White Ship</i>, two years after his mother's death. Henry's second marriage, to Adeliza of Louvain, was settled with remarkable haste, the marriage taking place at Windsor on 29 January 1121. Ralph was too unwell to perform the wedding, but insisted on taking part in the coronation the following day. His celebrated ease of manner had disintegrated under the pressure of illness and failure, and he broke off the ceremony on seeing the king wearing the crown that it was the archbishop's cherished right to place upon his head. With unexpected restraint the king agreed to untie the thong below his chin, and Ralph was ultimately persuaded to replace the crown and allow the mass to proceed. In the summer he entertained yet another papal legate, Cardinal Pietro Pierleone, later the antipope Anacletus II, at Canterbury and seized the opportunity to display the largely forged privileges of his see. Ralph was again ill at Michaelmas, and so could not attend the council where the king pressed Thurstan once more to agree to make a profession, and with no more success. His last recorded act was to consecrate Gregory as bishop of Dublin at Lambeth on 2 October. By now he was failing fast; he does not certainly attest any later royal charters, and Eadmer has nothing to report of him from then until his death at Canterbury on 20 October 1122. He was buried in the middle of the cathedral nave three days later.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Ralph's pontificate was in many ways unsuccessful; he struggled long and fruitlessly against ill health and a world that had little place for the exceptional privileges of Canterbury which Lanfranc had secured in very different times. There is a marked difference between the accounts of Anselm and Ralph given by Eadmer, who served them both, and Ralph seems a colourless figure by comparison with his predecessor. For the most part the supporters of York could find little to say for him, yet even one of those could call him worthy of his high office, as it were a lesser pope, barely second to a king to whom he was right arm, heart, and eye. Eadmer, too, speaks of Ralph's shrewd counsel even after his stroke. Elsewhere testimonies to his learning and piety are widespread. The worst that the young William of Malmesbury could say of him was that he could descend into unbecoming frivolity. He was generous to the monks of Canterbury as well as Rochester and his twenty-five surviving charters show him making valuable gifts to Lewes, St Osyth's, and the nuns of Malling. At Abingdon he intervened to make peace when the monks fell out with their abbot; he supported Christina of Markyate in her tribulations; in Wales, Ireland, and Scotland he sought to maintain the influence of Canterbury as vigorously as any of his predecessors.<br>
<br>Apart from a handful of letters on routine business, and a defence of Canterbury's claims over York addressed to Pope Calixtus, impassioned to the point of incoherence and probably to be conceived as the collective work of Canterbury's partisans, only one work of his certainly survives, a sermon on the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin. Originally delivered to the monks of S&eacute;es in French, it was translated into Latin at the request of abbots Guillaume of F&eacute;camp and Arnulf of Troarn; travelling under false colours as the work of Anselm it survives in some fifty manuscripts. There was even an Anglo-Saxon translation from the Latin text found in a single manuscript, probably from Canterbury or Rochester. Modest though it is, this celebration of the Virgin's chastity and humility from his happiest years remains Ralph's most apt memorial.<br>
