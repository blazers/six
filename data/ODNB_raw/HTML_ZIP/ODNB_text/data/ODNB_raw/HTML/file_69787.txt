<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Lilias Eveline</span>  (1882&#150;1937), <span class="occ">phonetician</span>, born on 29 September 1882 at 152 Eccles New Road, Pendlebury, near Manchester, was the daughter of James William Armstrong, Free Methodist church minister, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Armstrong, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunter. On 24 September 1926, at the Hampstead register office, London, she married Simeon Karlovitch Boyanus (1871&#150;1952), who at the time was professor of English philology at the University of Leningrad. It was not until 1934 that Boyanus was permitted by the Soviet authorities to settle permanently in London, where he took up a lectureship in Russian at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies.<br>
<br>Armstrong graduated in 1908 as BA of the University of Leeds, where she was a king's scholar and where her principal subjects were French and Latin. Her first appointment after graduation was as a teacher of French at the higher elementary school, East Ham, London. She was senior mistress there when she left in 1918 for University College, London, to become full-time assistant to Daniel Jones (1881&#150;1967) in the department of phonetics. In making this move, after having been fired with enthusiasm for phonetics through attending evening classes in the subject at University College, Armstrong left a secure position, from which she could without doubt have expected to acquire a post as headmistress, for a temporary appointment with a lower salary. Her outstanding ability and her personal qualities, however, ensured her success in her new career. She was appointed senior lecturer in 1921 and reader in 1936.<br>
<br>Jones, while giving strong encouragement to his departmental colleagues to engage in research and publication, laid great stress on the practical side of the discipline. A sensitive ear that allowed a phonetician unerringly to recognize fine distinctions of sound was much prized, as was the ability accurately to reproduce the sounds, in meaningful utterances, of a language under description. To Jones, Armstrong was in these terms &#145;one of the finest phoneticians in the world&#146;  (Jones, &#145;Lilias Armstrong&#146;, 2), and to be taught by her the phonetics of any of the languages she had studied was regarded as a memorable experience.<br>
<br>The earlier of Armstrong's many publications emphasized the practical aspect of the study, being often intended primarily as an aid to pronouncing correctly the language described. They were, however, firmly based in Jonesian phonological theory and in effect provided an account of the phonemic structure, along with allophonic variations, of the language, though generally without the explicit use of the word &#145;phoneme&#146;. All the writings of Lilias Armstrong, whatever their intended readership, were characterized by clarity of structure and expression, by comprehensiveness, and by a careful attention to detail.<br>
<br>For Jones and his colleagues an important tool in learning to pronounce a language well was a set of texts in phonetic transcription. Armstrong was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">Le Ma&icirc;tre Phon&eacute;tique</span>, the journal of the International Phonetic Association, and also for some years its assistant editor. A regular section of this periodical was a &#145;Partie des &eacute;l&egrave;ves&#146;, which consisted of reading passages of phonetically transcribed material in a variety of languages, often prepared by Armstrong. Her first book, <span class="italic">An English Phonetic Reader</span> (1923), was an extended example of this type of work. Two years later she collaborated with Pe Maung Tin to produce a similar work for his language, <span class="italic">A Burmese Phonetic Reader</span> (1925). Preceding the transcribed passages in these readers as a standard feature was an account of the phonetic structure of the language.<br>
<br>Throughout her career Armstrong retained a strong interest in the language that she had taught as a schoolteacher. After conducting classes on its phonetic structure for a number of years, she wrote <span class="italic">The Phonetics of French: a Practical Handbook</span> (1932) which, though later superseded largely as a result of changes in the pronunciation of French since its publication, remained a useful work of reference. It is concerned principally with the phonological segments of French and does not deal in detail with intonation. This gap was filled by her co-operation with her colleague H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Coustenoble (1894&#150;1962) in preparing <span class="italic">Studies in French Intonation</span> (1934), a work of theoretical importance as well as practical usefulness. In a similar way Armstrong worked with Ida C. Ward (1880&#150;1950), also a member of her department, on a <span class="italic">Handbook of English Intonation</span> (1926).<br>
<br>Armstrong's research on African languages was intended more for an academic than for a student audience. Her published results include an important article, &#145;The phonetic structure of Somali&#146; (1934), and a major book, the outcome of three years of research, <span class="italic">The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu</span>, published posthumously under the editorship of Beatrice Honikman (1940). The appearance of this book made clear the pioneering nature of Armstrong's work on the language, in particular with regard to her analysis of the importance of tonal features in the structure of both nouns and verbs. Her informant for her research on Kikuyu was Jomo Kenyatta (1889&#150;1978), who later became prime minister and president of Kenya.<br>
<br>Lilias Armstrong died in Finchley Memorial Hospital, Middlesex, on 9 December 1937, following a stroke. This early and unexpected death left colleagues with a certain sense of promise not entirely fulfilled as a writer. Her interest in general phonetic theory led her to study a wide range of very different languages of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and her fascination with the variety of phonetic typology might have considerably expanded her range of publications if her academic career had run its full course.<br>
