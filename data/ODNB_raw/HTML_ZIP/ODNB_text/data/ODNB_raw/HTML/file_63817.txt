<span class="headword">Forsyth,  David</span>  (1844&#150;1934), <span class="occ">headmaster and educationist</span>, was born in October 1844 at Coatbridge, Glasgow, the son of David Forsyth, a master engineer, and his wife, Agnes Laidlaw. He began his teaching career at the age of thirteen as a pupil teacher in Ayrshire. In 1862, at the age of eighteen, he won a first-class queen's scholarship to the Church of Scotland Training College in Glasgow. He entered the University of Glasgow in 1864 and gained his MA degree in 1870, the year in which, on 5 July at Cambridge Street, Glasgow, he married Christina Cairns (1845&#150;1922) of Darlington, daughter of Andrew Cairns, a foreman cabinet-maker, and his wife, Mary Ann Brand. By this time he had already served for one year as headmaster of Green Street School, one of the largest elementary schools in the east end of Glasgow.<br>
<br>In 1875 Forsyth was appointed to a lectureship at the Church of Scotland Training College, having spent the previous three years as headmaster of its practising school. During his time at the college he developed a specialist interest in geology; he gained a BSc degree at the University of Glasgow in 1884 and became a DSc by examination in the same subject in 1890. He also travelled extensively throughout Scotland, lecturing on a variety of subjects, and wrote a book on the teaching of perspective (1883). He later edited a volume of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> (1899), and provided an introduction to a successful chemistry textbook (1899) written by one of his staff.<br>
<br>In 1889 Forsyth was appointed headmaster of the higher grade school in Leeds. Here, as in most major towns and cities, the expenditure of ratepayers' money by the school board on higher grade education, which was secondary in all but name, was a major political issue. Strongly opposed to the class system that shaped secondary education in England, Forsyth sought to promote higher grade (post-elementary) education as the English equivalent of the practice, more common in Scotland, of educating in the parochial schools pupils drawn from very different classes within society. He played a major role in establishing an Association of Headmasters of Higher Grade and Organized Science Schools and, as its president, appeared before the royal commission on secondary education in 1894. He saw the future of higher grade schools in making the great mass of the people aware that they offered, at a very moderate cost, an education which would open the doors of the professions and the universities to children from poorer, as well as from more prosperous, families. Under his leadership the Leeds higher grade school, which had opened in temporary premises in 1885 with over 500 pupils, developed to become by the end of the century an institution with a distinguished academic record and a recognizable tradition that attracted favourable national and international attention.<br>
<br>In the closing decades of the nineteenth century public funds for education were available&#151;subject to inspection, success in examinations, or both&#151;for public elementary education and for courses and classes which met the very different requirements of the Department of Science and Art. These funding arrangements were complex and lacked co-ordination but Forsyth exploited them to the full to construct a senior-school curriculum at the Leeds Central higher grade school that included English, Latin, mathematics, French, German, science, geography, history, art, commercial subjects, and drawing. Pupils from the school were outstandingly successful in a range of public examinations, securing prizes for their work in the examinations set by the Department of Science and Art and gaining a stream of passes in the important matriculation examination of the University of London. In addition, between 1894 and 1903, they won over &pound;8000 in scholarships and bursaries, and sixty-five former pupils gained university degrees.<br>
<br>Equally committed to the democratic control of the governance of schooling, Forsyth advocated a national system of directly elected school boards responsible for the provision of education on behalf of the community. Although a different model of educational governance was embodied in the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902, his vision of the role of higher grade schools had a pioneering quality, and their work can be seen both as a response to the political and educational aspirations of a rapidly growing organized labour movement and as an important element in the emergence of a lower middle class within late nineteenth-century society. If higher grade schools necessarily fell somewhat short of accommodating all classes within society, there is no doubt that they provided an advanced academic education for many children belonging to a class that had hitherto had no such opportunity. Forsyth's own school was particularly important in educating the sons of Jewish immigrants who had settled in Leeds from about 1880 onwards; children from Jewish homes accounted for about 40 per cent of the boys in the senior classes at the school by the end of the First World War.<br>
<br>A firm disciplinarian deeply committed to the academic and professional improvement of his teaching staff, Forsyth was a familiar figure in a frock coat and silk hat, walking each day to school with short brisk steps. In the re-organization of post-elementary education that followed the legislation of 1902, his school became the Leeds Central high school, under the control of the newly created Leeds local education authority. He seized the opportunity provided by the events of 1902, and the subsequent establishment of an adjacent secondary school for girls, to develop the Central high school into a highly successful boys' grammar school, with its own Latin motto, and organized into houses that competed academically and on the sports field. The school continued to recruit pupils, on the basis of a scholarship examination, on an unusually wide social and geographical basis.<br>
<br>Forsyth remained headmaster until 1918, when he finally retired at the age of seventy-four. In 1915, accepting the award of an honorary degree of LLD from the University of Leeds, he expressed his gratitude that the university had acknowledged &#145;his type of school&#146; and the work he had done to promote the cause of popular higher education and the &#145;cultivation of a University spirit among the democracy&#146;  (Forsyth to M. E. Sadler, 20 March 1915, University of Leeds archive, microfilm 107, fol. 116). He was to do more, campaigning vigorously throughout the 1920s for funds for the institution which had honoured him. He died on 6 August 1934, two months short of his ninetieth birthday, at the home of his son, Dr J. A. Cairns Forsyth, in Fairholm, Alloway, Ayrshire. He was buried at Lawnswood cemetery, Leeds.<br>
