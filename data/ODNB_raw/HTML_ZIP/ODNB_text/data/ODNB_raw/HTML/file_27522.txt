<span class="headword">Tomlins,  Frederick Guest</span>  (1804&#150;1867), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in August 1804. Little is known of his family or education. He married on 3 May 1829 Jane Vasey. His career began with contributions to periodicals such as Henry Hetherington's <span class="italic">Poor Man's Guardian</span> in 1831. In 1834 he became associated with Thomas Mayhew in the publication of the <span class="roman">Penny National Library</span>, for which he edited, among other works, the <span class="italic">Variorum History of England from Rapin to Hume</span> (1836). For a long time afterwards he was in the employment of Whittaker &amp; Co., publishers, London, as publishing clerk and literary assistant to George Byrom Whittaker. Soon after Whittaker's death in 1847 Tomlins commenced business as a publisher in Southampton Street, Strand, London, and there issued his own periodicals, <span class="italic">The Self-Educator</span> and <span class="italic">The Topic</span>, which, however, were not very successful. He next opened a shop for new and second-hand books in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, near the British Museum, but after a while he abandoned business for literary pursuits.<br>
<br>Tomlins was well acquainted with Shakespeare and Shakespearian literature; he founded the Shakespeare Society in 1840 and acted as the society's secretary for the twelve years of its existence. His interest in the theatre dated back to his childhood, when he had seen Edmund Kean appear in the role of Shylock in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> at the Drury Lane Theatre in January 1814; this interest led him to publish various works on drama: <span class="italic">The Past and Present State of Dramatic Art and Literature</span> (1839) and, in 1841, <span class="italic">A brief view of the English drama, with suggestions for elevating the present condition of the art</span>, <span class="italic">The Nature and State of the English Drama</span>, and <span class="italic">The Relative Value of Acted and Unacted Drama</span>. Tomlins also tried his hand at writing his own tragedy, <span class="italic">Garcia, or, The Noble Error</span>, which was produced at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in December 1849. From 1850 to his death he acted as the dramatic and fine-art critic of the <span class="italic">Morning Advertiser</span>. For a while he was also sub-editor, and later proprietor, of <span class="italic">Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper</span>. In 1865 he became the political editor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Times</span>, to which he contributed a series of letters signed Littlejohn, and was also editorially connected with <span class="italic">The Leader</span> soon after it started.<br>
<br>On the death of his uncle, in 1864, Tomlins succeeded him as clerk of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, an office which had been held by his grandfather. Tomlins died at the Painter&#150;Stainers' Hall, Little Trinity Lane, Queenhithe, London, where he had been living, on 21 September 1867, and was buried at St Peter's Church, Croydon, on 27 September. He was survived by his wife and a daughter, who married a cousin in the merchant navy and subsequently went to Australia with her husband.<br>
