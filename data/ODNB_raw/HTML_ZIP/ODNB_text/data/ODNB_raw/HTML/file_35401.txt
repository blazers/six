<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Partington,  James Riddick</span>  (1886&#150;1965), <span class="occ">chemist and historian of science</span>, was born on 20 June 1886 at 194 Morris Green Lane, Middle Hulton, Lancashire, the only son and first of the three children of Alfred Partington, bookkeeper of Bolton, and his wife, Mary Agnes, daughter of Adam Riddick, tailor, of Dumfries. He was educated at Southport Science and Art School and became articled to the public analyst in Bolton after his parents returned there in 1901. By private study he qualified for entrance to Manchester University in 1906. After obtaining first-class honours in chemistry in 1909 he did research in physical organic chemistry under Arthur Lapworth, held a Beyer fellowship (1910&#150;11), and was awarded the MSc in 1911; his DSc followed in 1918.<br>
<br>An 1851 Exhibition scholarship enabled Partington to work on the specific heats of gases under H. Walther Nernst in Berlin from 1911 to 1913. Nernst's belief that mathematics was indispensable to the physical chemist inspired Partington's first book, <span class="italic">Higher Mathematics for University Students</span> (1911; 4th edn, 1931), while Nernst's grasp of theory and consummate experimental abilities gave Partington a model for his own academic career. Like Nernst, Partington wrote an influential <span class="italic">Textbook of Thermodynamics</span> (1913; 4th edn, 1950). He was an assistant lecturer and demonstrator in chemistry at Manchester University from 1913 to 1919, when London University appointed him professor of chemistry at East London College (renamed Queen Mary College in 1934). On 6 September 1919 Partington married a former student Marian Jones (1890&#150;1940), daughter of Thomas Jones, brickworks manager, of Buckley, Flintshire. Before raising their one son and two daughters she taught chemistry in London secondary schools. She committed suicide at their home in Wembley on 4 March 1940, while Partington was in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Partington's reputation had grown during the First World War. Soon after it started he joined the army and saw active service as an infantry and engineer officer, becoming a captain. For some time he purified water for the troops on the Somme, working on a barge with fellow chemist Eric K. Rideal. In 1916 they were transferred to the munitions inventions department of the Ministry of Munitions and, in the chemistry department of University College, London, headed by F. G. Donnan, joined a team developing a method of manufacturing nitric acid, needed for explosives, from atmospheric nitrogen. Partington's war experiences of applied chemistry led to two further books, <span class="italic">The Alkali Industry</span> (1918; 2nd edn, 1925) and, with L. H. Parker, <span class="italic">The Nitrogen Industry</span> (1922). He was appointed MBE (military) in 1918 and thereafter always adopted a military air.<br>
<br>Until retiring in 1951 Partington remained at Queen Mary College, which elected him a fellow in 1959. He continued research on specific heats of gases, electrochemistry, thermodynamics, and other topics, mainly in inorganic physical chemistry, and spent much time writing and revising textbooks on inorganic and physical chemistry for students at different levels. Despite a dazzling output of research papers it was these influential textbooks rather than his experimental work that made his name familiar to all chemists. His monumental <span class="italic">An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry</span> (5 vols., 1949&#150;54) contains a wealth of data in 1.5 million words and is of lasting value.<br>
<br>Partington's historical writings, which had begun in 1928 with a monograph, <span class="italic">The Composition of Water</span>, constitute his most enduring work. A meticulous scholar, he taught himself ancient and modern languages, used primary sources wherever possible, and produced a steady stream of books and articles on the history of chemistry. His <span class="italic">Origins and Development of Applied Chemistry</span> (1935) is a massive study of the production and uses of materials in the Near and Middle East to the end of the Bronze Age, the date at which previous historians of science had started. His military experience added weight to his criticism of earlier writings on the subject in <span class="italic">A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder</span> (1960). His fine <span class="italic">A Short History of Chemistry</span> (1937; 2nd edn, 1948) was the forerunner of the encyclopaedic <span class="italic">A History of Chemistry</span> (4 vols., 1961&#150;70). Volumes 2&#150;4 are a richly documented account of the period since 1500; Partington did not complete volume 1, part of which appeared posthumously, so his final views on alchemy remain unpublished.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Partington's college was evacuated to Cambridge. He lived there until 1964, then moved to Northwich, Cheshire, to be near his sister. His house was full of books, and in his study he could smoke his favourite strong tobacco, but he was often seen in London or Cambridge libraries, reading with intense concentration, constantly writing on slips of paper which he subsequently edited and pasted together to form the manuscript for a tolerant printer. A blunt and outspoken critic of contemporaries whose achievements seemed to him inadequate, he nevertheless gave praise where it was due. He was highly regarded in the 1920s and 1930s for his wide and scholarly knowledge of chemistry, his integrity, precision, and good sense, and those who knew him only as a historian in later years remember a reserved man with a dry sense of humour which reveals itself in the prefaces of some of his books.<br>
<br>Partington was the first chairman (1935&#150;46) of the Society for the Study of Alchemy and Early Chemistry; now the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry, it awards the triennial Partington prize to a young historian. From 1949 to 1951 he was president of the British Society for the History of Science. He received the American Chemical Society's Dexter award for history of chemistry in 1961 and the Sarton medal of the American History of Science Society shortly before his death.<br>
<br>Partington died on 9 October 1965 in the Grange Hospital, Weaverham, Cheshire. He bequeathed his fine library to Manchester University.<br>
