<span class="headword">Bacon, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1336), <span class="occ">justice</span>, apparently came from Norfolk, where he held land at Burnham Deepdale. His parentage is unknown, but he seems to have been connected in some way with Sir Edmund Bacon, who held the manor of Gresham; suggestions that he was lord of Baconsthorpe in the same county appear to result from confusion with a namesake. First recorded in November 1306, following his marriage to Denise, the widow of John de Boys (which brought him a life interest in lands and rents in Essex and Cambridgeshire), he had become a sergeant in the court of common pleas by Hilary term 1311, and appeared regularly in the central courts thereafter; at the London eyre of 1321, for instance, he is reported as acting as counsel in eighteen cases. If it was he, rather than his namesake, who was pardoned as an associate of Thomas, earl of Lancaster, in 1313, this might help to explain why his career was confined to the courts until 1327, and also why he advanced rapidly afterwards. His appointment as a justice of the common pleas on 30 December 1329 did not take effect, but that may have been the result of his heavy engagement in the Northamptonshire eyre of 1329&#150;30, where he was one of the most active sergeants. But on 28 January 1332 he was appointed a justice of king's bench, and in the same year was made a knight-banneret, appropriate apparel being provided at the king's expense.<br>
<br>Bacon served in king's bench until Michaelmas 1335. At the same time he shouldered a substantial burden of judicial and administrative business, as a commissioner of oyer and terminer, and as a justice of assize and gaol delivery, mostly in East Anglia and the home counties. In the parliament of Hilary term 1332 he was a trier of petitions for Gascony, Ireland, and Wales, and later in that year he was an assessor of tallage in Norfolk and Suffolk. Two years later he was a commissioner to negotiate a lay subsidy in Kent, while in 1335 he was appointed to investigate the conduct of tax collectors in a number of counties in south-east England. Such employment continued after Bacon had left king's bench, his last commission being dated 10 October 1336. He was dead by 10 December following, and in October 1337 his executors&#151;the prior and sub-prior of St Bartholomew's, Smithfield&#151;were ordered to surrender his rolls into king's bench. Survived by his widow, who lived until 27 April 1349, Bacon is not known to have had any children.<br>
