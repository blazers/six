<span class="headword">Morris, Sir  Harold Spencer</span>  (1876&#150;1967), <span class="occ">barrister and industrial arbitrator</span>, was born at 21 Compton Terrace, Highbury, London, on 21 December 1876, the second son of Sir Malcolm Alexander Morris FRCS (Edinburgh) (1849&#150;1924) and his wife, Fanny Cox of Dorchester-on-Thames. Malcolm Morris had a distinguished career as a consulting surgeon and as a specialist in skin diseases, practising from 8 Harley Street, London, where he moved with his family in September 1887 from their former home at 63 Montagu Square.<br>
<br>Harold Morris was educated at Westminster School, Clifton College, and from 1894 at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read law, graduating in 1897 with a fourth-class degree. Having joined the Inner Temple he was called to the bar on 26 January 1899. Among those called the same night there were three others who, like him, later became benchers; in 1949 on the fiftieth anniversary of their call to the bar (as indeed on some later anniversaries) the four dined together in hall in company with and to the delight of their fellow benchers. The other three were John Simon, who to his other high offices added that of lord chancellor from 1940 to 1945, Rayner Goddard, who was appointed lord chief justice of England in 1946, and the Hon. Victor Alexander Russell, a popular and respected practitioner in the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division.<br>
<br>Morris practised at the common-law bar and was a member of the south-eastern circuit. For anyone who had been building up a practice in the years after 1899, and especially for someone with a young family, the outbreak of war in 1914 threatened grievous professional upset. In 1904 Morris had married Olga, the daughter of Emil Teichman, of Chislehurst. It was a happy marriage. They had four daughters and one son, Malcolm John Morris, who followed his father into the legal profession. Malcolm Morris was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1937, became QC in 1959 and a bencher (in his father's lifetime) in 1965; he held various recorderships and then became a judge at the central criminal court where he sat until his untimely death in 1972.<br>
<br>Anxious to serve in the war, Morris was commissioned in the Coldstream Guards on 2 June 1916. In June 1918 he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as deputy assistant adjutant-general; he was appointed a court-martial officer with the rank of major, was mentioned in dispatches, and in 1919 was appointed MBE. After demobilization in February 1919, Morris returned to the bar where he successfully re-established himself and took silk in 1921. As an advocate he was competent; as a speaker either in court or on social occasions he was pleasing, lively, and interesting. He possessed a natural buoyancy and gaiety and courtesy; he had good looks. The combination of all these qualities seemed to augur for him a legal career of promise which could lead to a thriving practice with prospects of elevation to the High Court bench. He was appointed recorder of Folkestone in 1921 and held the post until 1926. In November 1922 he entered parliament as National Liberal member for East Bristol but in the general election of the following year he lost the seat.<br>
<br>In 1925 Morris was asked to chair a court of investigation to consider a dispute in the woollen industry. His success in that capacity doubtless led to his being invited (as he was in 1925) to succeed Sir William Warrender MacKenzie as chairman of the railways national wages board and to his being appointed in the following year (1926) to succeed Sir William as president of the industrial court&#151;a position which he continued to hold until 1945. He was knighted in 1927.<br>
<br>In the period before Morris accepted these positions his health was for a time not good. In such situations a secure position freed from the stresses and strains of life at the bar holds attractions, and Morris was probably so influenced. Though his appointment as president of the industrial court was to a position of great national importance and prestige, it meant that after only four or five years in silk Morris would have to abandon any prospects of building up a large practice and of being appointed to the High Court bench.<br>
<br>Wise and impartial, Morris had the qualities which fitted him to be an admirable president of the industrial court. Assuredly his tenure of the presidency during years of economic difficulties and anxieties gave satisfaction and inspired confidence. For a short time (from 1930 to 1935), he added to his work by chairing the coal wages board after the passing of the <span class="roman">Coal Mines Act</span> of 1930.<br>
<br>Even after retiring in 1945 he continued to render public service: very acceptably, he sat judicially from time to time at Middlesex quarter sessions, at the central criminal court, and in other courts.<br>
<br>Morris's happy appreciation and understanding of life at the bar inspired him to write in 1930 an entertaining book, <span class="italic">The Barrister</span>. Years later, in 1960, came an autobiographical volume of much interest, <span class="italic">Back View</span>. He died at his home, 21 Lichfield Road, Kew, Surrey, on 11 November 1967.<br>
