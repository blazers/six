<span class="headword">O'Connell,  Moritz <span class="st"> [Murty]</span></span>, Baron O'Connell in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1738&#150;1830), <span class="occ">army officer in the Austrian service</span>, was born in Ireland; he was christened Murty (<i>recte</i> Muircheartach), but this name was subsequently changed to Moritz. The son of Maurice O'Connell of Tarmon, co. Kerry, and his wife, Mary O'Sullivan Beare, sister of Murty Oge O'Sullivan Beare; he was the grandson of John O'Connell, captain in the king's guard, who had fought at Limerick, Londonderry, Aughrim, and the Boyne. In spring 1761 Murty O'Connell travelled to the continent with his cousin and lifelong friend Daniel Charles O'Connell. A family ballad written at the time lamented the fact that Catholics were forced to leave Ireland to forward their careers; it urged: &#145;to the land of the lily [France] bear the shamrock of our isle, may they bloom above the blood stained rose [England]&#146;  (O'Connell, 1.69). However, it was to be Daniel's nephew, also Daniel O'Connell, who finally gained Catholic emancipation for Ireland.<br>
<br>Both men served in the last two campaigns of the Seven Years' War, Moritz O'Connell as an Austrian officer in Marshal Daune's regiment of horse and his cousin as an officer in the French infantry regiment. O'Connell, who was known as Moritz in Austria, attracted the notice of Empress Maria Theresa while he was serving as a sentry in one of her palaces, and received the gift of a watch. He was soon transferred from his military duties to the imperial chamberlain's department. He held the office of imperial chamberlain for fifty-nine years under the emperors Joseph, Leopold, and Francis, and by 1806 he had been created a baron and had attained the rank of general. He married and had one daughter. O'Connell died in Vienna early in 1830, aged ninety-one, and left his property to his relative Geoffrey O'Connell of Cork.<br>
