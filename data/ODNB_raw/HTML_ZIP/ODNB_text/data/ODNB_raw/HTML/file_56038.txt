<span class="headword">Ward,  Winifred Mary  Kingdon-</span>  (1884&#150;1979), <span class="occ">speech therapist</span>, was born at 30 Victoria Road, Old Charlton, Kent, on 12 October 1884, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36729/', "Harry Marshall Ward (1854&#150;1906)")</script>, botanist, and his wife, Selina Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kingdon (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Francis Kingdon, of Exeter. Her younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34327/', "Francis (Frank) Kingdon-Ward")</script>, became a renowned plant collector and author. Winifred studied speech and singing, and during the First World War was involved in working with wounded soldiers returning from the front. Many had suffered head injuries which led to disorders of speech and language, while others presented with stammering related to shell-shock. She was one of the first British speech therapists appointed to work with patients in a hospital setting and held posts at the West End Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Maida Vale Hospital, the West London Hospital, and Pembury Hospital in Kent.<br>
<br>After the war Kingdon-Ward saw the need for an academically and medically orientated form of training and began to offer aspiring speech therapists at the West End Hospital opportunities for observation and guidance. The West End Hospital school was founded under her direction in 1929. She also played a major part in the development of the British Society of Speech Therapists, which was formed in 1934. She left the West End Hospital school in 1935 in order to spend time in South Africa. When she returned to London shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War she was unable to resume her old post and took steps to set up a second course in conjunction with a former student, Amy Swallow. The London Hospitals School of Speech Therapy was founded in 1942 in Cavendish Square. The previous year she had published <span class="italic">Stammering: Problems and Theories</span>. This represented the first major text on the subject in the British literature and was one of the earliest works on any topic in the field. She was one of the first authorities to recognize that there are different types and causes of stammering and she maintained that therapists should adapt their approach accordingly. The German, French, and American authorities tended to talk of a single cause.<br>
<br>Kingdon-Ward retired from her post as principal of the London Hospitals School in 1948, and it was renamed the Kingdon-Ward School of Speech Therapy. She continued to work in the National Health Service for many years after normal retirement age. In 1954 she published <span class="italic">A Book of Rhymes and Jingles for Children</span> for the use of speech therapists. She had already produced a volume of poetry, <span class="italic">The Flaming Fountains</span>, published in 1927.<br>
<br>Kingdon-Ward was an enthusiastic and gifted therapist, and though somewhat shy had such a strong presence that a patient with whom she was working would hardly be aware of the group of students who were observing the session. She always insisted that students should develop their powers of observation. She had considerable foresight and strength of character, and always warmly supported the drive of the profession towards greater academic rigour. She died in the St Charles Hospital, Kensington, London, on 26 January 1979.<br>
