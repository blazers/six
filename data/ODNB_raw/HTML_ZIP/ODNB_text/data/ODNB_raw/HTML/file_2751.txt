<span class="headword">Boddington,  Henry John</span>  (1811&#150;1865), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in the Marylebone district of London, as Henry John Williams, second son of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38357/', "Edward (&#145;Moonlight&#146;) Williams (1781&#150;1855)")</script> and his wife, Ann Hildebrandt (<i>bap</i>. 1780, <i>d</i>. 1851), who was of German-Jewish extraction. Edward Williams was a nephew of the painter James Ward. In 1832, Henry John married Clarissa Eliza Boddington (1812&#150;1905), and at once adopted her maiden name, in order to distinguish his work from that of his five brothers, all of whom also became landscape painters: Edward Charles Williams (1807&#150;1881), George Augustus Williams (1814&#150;1901), and Alfred Walter Williams (1824&#150;1905) retained the family name, but <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21953/', "Sidney Richard Percy (1821&#150;1886)")</script> and Arthur Gilbert (1819&#150;1895) worked under their last forenames.<br>
<br>Boddington, who trained in his father's studio, developed a style clearly derived from the Dutch landscape tradition of Ruisdael and Hobbema, but characterized by greater naturalism and a more vivid use of colour. This air of modernity soon made his green and leafy landscapes very popular with the public. His name was well established by 1842 when he was elected a full member of the Society of British Artists, with whom he had exhibited since 1837 and where he displayed a total of 244 works.<br>
<br>Boddington was also a regular exhibitor with the Royal Academy and other London art associations, as well as provincial bodies such as the Royal Liverpool Academy. His bright style greatly appealed to the wealthy manufacturing classes who were the new art patrons, and he was a popular choice with Art Union prize winners. The front page of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> for 6 March 1847 showed a wood-engraving of <span class="italic">The Village Church</span>, exhibited at the British Institution in that year and described in the accompanying text as &#145;a genuine scene of English life&#146;. Sketching tours of Devon, Yorkshire, and the Lake District had broadened his scope. A first visit to north Wales in 1846 made a still deeper impact, and he later returned many times to the Merioneth area to produce some of his most admired and frequent subjects. <span class="italic">On the Hills, North Wales</span> (exh. Society of British Artists, 1860) won a lyrical description from a critic for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, who wrote &#145;The mountains are melting in vapoury sunlight &hellip; the artist is a master of this effect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 22, 1860, 143).<br>
<br>Boddington's only child, Edwin Henry (1836&#150;<i>c</i>.1905), painted in the manner of his father, but with less talent, disappearing from the exhibiting scene about 1870, and later from the family circle when he emigrated to Australia. H. J. Boddington always lived in the London area, finally in 1854 setting up a handsome establishment at 1 Lonsdale Villas, Barnes, where his father and brothers were already in neighbouring houses. Boddington was known as a kind and cheerful man, much respected by fellow artists. His last years were marred by failing eyesight and the crippling effects of a brain tumour, which led to his death, at his home, in mid-career, at the age of fifty-three, on 11 April 1865. He was buried in the Old Barnes cemetery; his grave is near those of Edward Williams, George Augustus Williams, and several other members of the family. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Fine Arts Quarterly Review</span> noted that &#145;He was an artist, who if he fell into mannerism, had yet during a hard working life, painted pictures not only large, but sometimes grand. His landscapes of mountain, lake and river had scenic breadth and power&#146;  (p. 371).<br>
<br>The paintings of H. J. Boddington are now considered the most aesthetically pleasing of those produced by the Williams family, but they do not command such high prices as those of S. R. Percy. Works are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff; the Glasgow Art Gallery; the City Art Gallery, Blackburn; the Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston; the Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield; the City Art Gallery, York; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, USA.<br>
