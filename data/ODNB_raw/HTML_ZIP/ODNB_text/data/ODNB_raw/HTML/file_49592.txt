<span class="headword">Brown,  Frederick Richard</span>  (1910&#150;1991), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at Lima, Peru, on 16 December 1910, the son of Roger Grounds Brown, who had strong business interests in South America, and his wife, Inez Anita Milne. He attended St Peter's preparatory school, Vina del Mar, Valpara&iacute;so, until the age of ten, when he was brought to Britain. He was coached at St Piran's School, Maidenhead, by the famous South African G. A. Faulkner, founder of the first indoor cricket school. At the Leys School, Cambridge, already able to bowl the googly, he was brought on by N. J. Holloway and the Nottinghamshire professional Albert Iremonger. After four years in the eleven, two as captain, he emerged a ready-made all-rounder, tall, broad-chested, and powerful, a formidable striker of the ball and a strong wrist spinner.<br>
<br>As a Cambridge freshman (1930) Brown headed the bowling averages; in the next season he headed the batting and at the age of twenty won his first England caps against New Zealand. In 1931, after two years reading economics, he went down from St John's College, Cambridge, to take up a position in a firm of Lloyd's insurance brokers, which allowed him to continue to play cricket. In 1932 with Surrey he did the double of 1000 runs (1135) and 100 wickets (120), nearly all on the perfect Oval pitches. He also played one of the most memorable innings in county history, 168 in 2 hours 10 minutes against Kent at Blackheath. Then, with seven sixes in an innings of 212 lasting 3 hours 20 minutes, he lambasted Middlesex at the Oval.<br>
<br>Brown was a natural choice to tour Australia in 1932&#150;3, though his brand of cricket formed no part of the bodyline scheme of his captain, D. R. Jardine. In the remaining pre-war years he alternated between county and club cricket to the benefit of both. Commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps in 1939, he was taken prisoner at Tobruk in June 1942 and lost 4 stone in captivity at Chieti, Italy. On his return to Britain he married, on 9 June 1945, Marjorie Elizabeth Palmer (<i>b</i>. 1910), the daughter of Ernest Cecil Nottage Palmer, deputy chairman of Huntley and Palmers, biscuit manufacturers. They had three sons and one daughter. Business claims, meanwhile, seemed to have put a finish to a career of rich promise, largely unfulfilled.<br>
<br>However, in 1949 came an opportunity which combined a profitable job with the leadership of Northamptonshire, a county apparently destined to be permanent holders of the wooden spoon. Brown not only transformed them, &#145;doing the double&#146; in that season as he had done for Surrey seventeen years before, but was chosen again for England, and as a result of an admirable 122 out of 131 in under two hours for Gentlemen against Players at Lord's the following year was chosen to take MCC to Australia in 1950&#150;51.<br>
<br>Though England were beaten in the rubber, as in the two previous ones, Brown's all-round cricket and cheerful personality greatly endeared him to the Australian public. After four defeats England won the fifth test, the captain, bowling now chiefly at medium pace, taking in the match eight for 81. In 1951 he led England to a 3&#150;1 victory over South Africa, and became a selector. Nor was that the swansong. In June 1953 his fellow selectors persuaded him to turn out once more against Australia, and in a highly dramatic drawn match at Lord's he played a full part with 50 runs and in 52 overs six wickets. After a gallant stand of 163 for the fifth wicket in the England second innings between Watson and Bailey, when Australia seemed to be coasting to victory, Brown added 28 to enable England to hold the fort.<br>
<br>Brown's qualities, surprising to say, did not adapt happily to the managership of overseas tours, when he took MCC sides to South Africa (1956&#150;7) and Australia (1958&#150;9). Press relations, amiable enough during his captaincy, were never cordial afterwards. Still to come, however, was long service in the governance of cricket, as chairman of selectors, president of MCC (1971&#150;2), chairman of the Cricket Council, and first chairman and then president of the National Cricket Association (1974&#150;90), where he was active in the encouragement of youth cricket. In the transfer between the loose control of the game by MCC and the more democratic structures dating from 1968 he played a leading part. For a few years he was in his element as a BBC commentator. He was raised from MBE to CBE in 1980. Brown died at his home, 13 Isles Court, Ramsbury, Marlborough, Wiltshire, on 24 July 1991.<br>
