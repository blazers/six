<span class="headword">Wardrop,  Marjory Scott</span>  (1869&#150;1909), <span class="occ">Georgian scholar and translator</span>, was born on 26 November 1869 at 41 Canton Street, Poplar, London, the only daughter and youngest of the three children of Thomas Caldwell Wardrop (1836&#150;1903), a joiner and partner in a building firm, and his wife, Marjory Cameron Scott (1837&#150;1918); both parents were Scottish. The family moved to Chislehurst, and she was educated there and at Eastbourne in private schools, where she learned French, German, and Latin. She later became fluent in Russian and Romanian; it is, however, for her mastery of Georgian that she was distinguished.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Kingdom of Georgia</span> (1888) by Marjory's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49215/', "(John) Oliver Wardrop")</script> first excited Marjory Wardrop's interest in the Caucasus. She longed to travel there herself, rather than, as she wrote, &#145;stay at home, just doing nothing when I might be living, learning and working&#146;  (N. Wardrop, 511). At the age of twenty she began her study of Georgian with an alphabet and a gospel. Working at home with books sent by her brother, she embarked on the challenging task of translating the long twelfth-century poem <span class="italic">The Man in the Panther's Skin</span> by Shot&#145;a Rust&#145;aveli, a courtly epic from the classical period of Georgian literature. In this she was encouraged by the Georgian man of letters Prince Ilia Chadchadadze, whose permission she had sought to translate his poem <span class="italic">The Hermit</span>. Her letter so impressed him that he published it in his newspaper as a model of literary style. She worked on the epic throughout her life, modestly denying that it was perfect enough for publication, and it appeared only after her death, prepared for the press by her brother in 1912. Meanwhile she published <span class="italic">Georgian Folktales</span> (1894), the first translation into English of secular Georgian literature.<br>
<br>Marjory's parents were persuaded that she might join her brother, then in the Caucasus, and the pleasure that she took in her first visit is vividly described in her unpublished &#145;Notes on a journey into Georgia in 1894&#150;5&#146;. Georgians rate hospitality highly, and she and her brother were entertained by friends in literary circles with open-air banquets, dancing, and singing. It was known and appreciated that Marjory was translating their national epic, and in espousing the Georgian language the Wardrops were supporting the nationalist cause. Soon after this visit Marjory Wardrop's rendering of <span class="italic">The Hermit</span> (1895) was published. Her flowing verse makes it the best of her translations, and it was well received in Georgia. On her second visit to the Caucasus in 1896 she was f&ecirc;ted everywhere. Such was her gentle charm and warmth of character that she made many friends and kept up a close correspondence with them.<br>
<br>After her brother joined the consular service in 1895 Marjory Wardrop accompanied him on all his postings. For ten years she lived in Russia&#151;at Kertch (1895&#150;1902), Sevastopol (1899), and St Petersburg (1903&#150;5)&#151;and she was briefly in Tunis, Haiti, and Poland. Using her collection of Georgian books, she continued her work on Rust'aveli's epic and, with her brother, published from medieval texts the <span class="italic">Life of St Nino</span> (1900), on the fourth-century female evangelist of Georgia.<br>
<br>The contemporary problems of the country were also of great concern to Marjory Wardrop. While in St Petersburg during the Russian Revolution of 1905 she translated for the British embassy accounts of Cossack repression in Georgia. She was active on the Georgia Relief Committee and made a personal plea to the bishop of Gibraltar to intercede with the Russian holy synod on behalf of the Georgian church. The last three years of her life were spent in Romania (1906&#150;9). After a brief illness she died, unmarried, on 7 December 1909 at the British consul-general's home in Bucharest, and on 21 December was buried in St Nicholas's parish churchyard, Sevenoaks, Kent.<br>
<br>Marjory Wardrop's translations were made at a time when Georgians were emphasizing their distinctive culture in the face of increasing Russification. Her work led to a wider appreciation not only of Georgian literature but of the country itself, and for this she was held in the highest regard and affection throughout Georgia. In his sister's memory Oliver Wardrop established in Oxford the Marjory Wardrop Fund with the aim of encouraging Georgian studies; her extensive library and papers are in the Wardrop collection of the Bodleian Library.<br>
