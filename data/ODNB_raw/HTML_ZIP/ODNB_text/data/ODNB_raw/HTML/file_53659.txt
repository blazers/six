<span class="headword">Bolnest,  Edward</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1666&#150;1675), <span class="occ">medical practitioner</span>, practised medicine in London, residing on Jewen or Jewin Street (near Cripplegate) in 1665, and on Queen Street (near Guildhall) in 1672; few details of his life are known. Along with several other advocates of the &#145;chymical&#146; approach to medicine, he contributed to the boisterous seventeenth-century opposition to traditional Galenic medicine, and as such could reasonably be described as a Paracelsian. His first work, <span class="italic">Medicina instaurata</span> (1665), assailed medical authorities and promoted a rigidly spagyric approach to pharmacy, maintaining that the efficacy of medicines was impeded by &#145;dross and impurity&#146; which &#145;choaks and overpowers&#146; the operative principles, and proposed the separation, purification, and reconstitution of materia medica into purer and more potent forms. Marchamont Needham supplied a prefatory epistle for the work. Bolnest was a member of the &#145;Society of Chymical Physicians&#146; formed partly in opposition to the established College of Physicians, and was one of those who endeavoured to prove the superiority of chemical medicines by remaining active in London during the great plague of 1665 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/107538', "Society of Chemical Physicians")</script>].<br>
<br>Bolnest was involved in a dispute with the alchemist and philosopher Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius Philalethes). According to Vaughan's deposition, Bolnest approached him about 1656&#150;7 offering to pay &pound;300 for instruction in &#145;naturall philosophy and Chimicall physicke&#146;  (18 May 1661, TNA: PRO, C7/354/45) but paid only &pound;20 to &pound;30 and then brought soldiers to plunder Vaughan's house and arrest him (Vaughan later claimed that Bolnest was a soldier for Cromwell). Vaughan offered a bond from which Bolnest offered release for &#145;a certain physicall receipt of great value&#146;, to which Vaughan assented. Later Bolnest sued Vaughan for &pound;150, whereupon Vaughan subpoenaed Bolnest. Bolnest denied Vaughan's charges, claiming he lent Vaughan &pound;250 to make the philosophers' stone, which he later found he could not do. The resolution of the case is unknown.<br>
<br>Bolnest's notions were derivative of Paracelsus and van Helmont. <span class="italic">Medicina instaurata</span>'s postscript promised an <span class="italic">Aurora chymica</span>, which eventually appeared in 1672 (Latin edn, 1675), containing receipts for chemical medicines. A further work, <span class="italic">Fontina salutis</span>, was promised in a postscript to <span class="italic">Aurora</span>, but never appeared. The failure of this work to appear may suggest Bolnest's death in the mid- or late 1670s.<br>
