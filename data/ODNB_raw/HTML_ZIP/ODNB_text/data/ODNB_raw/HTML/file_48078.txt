<span class="headword">Mullard,  Stanley Robert</span>  (1883&#150;1979), <span class="occ">radio engineer and industrialist</span>, was born in Bermondsey, London, on 1 November 1883, the third of five children of Robert Mullard and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ludford. He left school at the age of fourteen, joining Mackey's Electric Lamp Company Ltd, where his father was works manager, in 1899. He joined the Institution of Electrical Engineers as a student in 1903, becoming a full member in 1910 and a fellow in 1928. By the early age of twenty-three he was a director of the Mackey company. Two years later, in 1908, he married Emmie Gladys Winifred, daughter of George Walter Hole, an estate agent.<br>
<br>The Mackey company failed in 1909, and Mullard went to the lamp factory of Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme des Usines Pintsch in Paris. He returned to England in 1910 to take charge of Ediswan's research laboratory at Ponders End, Middlesex. Ediswan was then experimenting with silica (fused quartz) instead of conventional glass envelopes for filament lamps; silica has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, and so was subject to lower stresses as the lamps warmed up. Mullard put this experience to good use when commissioned in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1916. He was posted to the wireless telegraphy establishment in HMS <i>Vernon</i> to assist in developing silica radio valves for high-powered wireless transmitters. The first successful silica valve, produced in September 1920, had an output of 10 kilowatts on test&#151;sixty times the maximum power from contemporary valves with glass envelopes.<br>
<br>After demobilization in 1919, Mullard was appointed managing director of the &#145;Z&#146; Electric Lamp Manufacturing Company and also continued his research for the Royal Navy. On 17 September 1920 he set up the Mullard Radio Valve Company, which at first used part of the &#145;Z&#146; Company's works at Southfields, Wimbledon, and then moved to its own premises in Claybrook Road, Hammersmith in 1921. Mullard's company was financed largely by the Radio Communication Company (RCC), on the strength of an order for 250 silica valves (at &pound;66 each) from the Admiralty. Mullard's new business did not depend on producing transmitting valves alone. The broadcasting boom of the 1920s created a market for small receiver valves as well. In 1923 the company moved to new premises in Nightingale Lane, Balham, increasing its manufacturing capacity to meet the demand. Mullard's experience of all aspects of electric lamp production was invaluable. His company established a reputation for efficiency; he was soon selling valves at about half the prices of other manufacturers. But success brought unwelcome attention from powerful rivals. In 1922 the Marconi group brought a suit against Mullards, alleging infringement of their patents. Mullard fought the case as far as the House of Lords, with judgment given in his favour at every stage. However, it is unlikely that his small company could have survived this action on its own resources. It depended on the support of RCC and of the Admiralty; both would have been liable for substantial royalties had Marconis won the case.<br>
<br>But the company lacked the capacity to develop its own techniques. In 1925 Mullard therefore agreed to sell 50 per cent of Mullards stock to N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken of the Netherlands, in order to benefit from Philips's research and patents. In return, the Dutch firm gained entry to the heavily protected British valve market. But, despite Mullard's personal reassurance, the powerful new shareholder exerted an increasing influence on the company's activities. The strength of the existing shareholders was reduced at about the same time by Marconi's acquisition of RCC. Philips was then able to purchase the remaining equity (in Mullard's name), the company becoming a fully owned subsidiary of Philips in January 1927. Mullard apparently misunderstood the full implications of this takeover. He was an experienced engineer and administrator, a competent organizer and team leader. From 1920 to 1925 he had been personally responsible for his company's policies. Appointed managing director by the Philips board in 1927, he appears to have expected this state of affairs to continue. The new owners, understandably, insisted on deciding important matters for themselves. After considerable friction, Mullard resigned in 1930, ostensibly on medical advice. He remained a director until 1970, but his duties were purely nominal.<br>
<br>Described by a friend as &#145;grim, saturnine, take-it-or-leave-it, a good business man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>), Mullard had an aversion to publicity. The Philips takeover left him with a sense of grievance, exacerbating his reticence about business affairs. He withdrew entirely from the radio industry after 1930, devoting his time to horticulture. In later years he said that he had made more money from growing carnations than he received for his contributions to electronics. Mullard died at Brooklands Nursing Home, Paddockhall Road, Haywards Heath, Sussex (where he was then resident), on 1 September 1979. He was survived by a son and three daughters.<br>
