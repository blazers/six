<span class="headword">Brown,  Isaac  Baker</span>  (1811&#150;1873), <span class="occ">surgical gynaecologist</span>, was born at Colne Engaine, Essex, the second son of Isaac Baker Brown (<i>b</i>. 1786), gentleman farmer, and Catherine, daughter of the Revd James Boyer, master of the Blue Coat School. Baker Brown was educated at Halstead in Essex and began his career as an apprentice to Mr Gibson, principal surgeon of the county. In 1831 he became a student at Guy's Hospital, London, distinguishing himself in midwifery and diseases of women. On 18 June 1833 he married Anne Rusher Barron at St Mary the Virgin (at the Walls), Colchester. In 1834 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and opened a general practice in Connaught Square, London. Subsequently he achieved a considerable reputation as an accoucheur and &#145;woman's surgeon&#146;, eventually limiting his practice to gynaecological disease.<br>
<br>In 1848, after becoming a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and a founding member of St Mary's Hospital, Baker Brown enthusiastically adopted the emerging surgical model for gynaecology. His faith in the ultimate efficacy of ovariotomy, for example, was so strong that he performed his fourth ovariotomy on his own sister in 1852, even though each of his first three patients died as a result of the surgery. Fortunately his sister recovered, encouraging his pursuit of dramatic new cures by surgical means.<br>
<br>During the nineteenth century obstetrics and gynaecology were separate fields of medical practice. Given his training in obstetrics, why did Isaac Baker Brown choose to limit his practice to gynaecological disease? The answer is suggested by his relatively modest origins. Baker Brown's obituaries identify his father simply as a &#145;gentleman farmer&#146;, while his mother received only slightly more recognition as the daughter of a school headmaster. He was educated locally and served an apprenticeship with a county surgeon. Even though he distinguished himself during his hospital appointment, his background was provincial. He also lacked the key requirement for entry to the medical &eacute;lite, a university degree. As an ambitious young man, therefore, Baker Brown needed other avenues to higher professional and social status.<br>
<br>The new field of surgical gynaecology offered Baker Brown just such possibilities. There is always more scope for advancement in an emerging field than in an older one and by the 1840s obstetrics was well established, with its own hierarchy of practitioners. After the introduction of anaesthesia in 1847, surgical innovation and experimentation expanded. Along with a number of British and American surgeons in the 1850s, Baker Brown saw the possibilities in developing supposedly fast, painless, and complete surgical treatments for &#145;female complaints&#146; as an alternative to lengthy, painful, and often ineffective medical therapies.<br>
<br>Another British pioneer in gynaecological surgery, Thomas Spencer Wells, served as colleague, supporter, and role model for Baker Brown in the early years of his career. Baker Brown may have been even more inspired, however, by the entrepreneurial spirit of American gynaecologist J. Marion Sims. Sims spent considerable time in London during the American Civil War and demonstrated his operation for vesico-vaginal fistula to Baker Brown. Both men shared somewhat humble origins and a penchant for self-promotion in the non-medical press.<br>
<br>Baker Brown achieved prominence as a pioneering surgical gynaecologist, establishing a reputation for surgical dexterity and daring. In 1854 he published <span class="italic">On some Diseases of Women Admitting of Surgical Treatment</span> and four years later opened the London Surgical Home where he could devote himself to refining and expanding surgical procedures. He reached the zenith of his career in 1865 with his election as president of the Medical Society of London. His career ended in disgrace, however, when his promotion of clitoridectomy as a cure for numerous female &#145;nervous complaints&#146; precipitated professional controversy and a public scandal.<br>
<br>In his attempts to apply surgical therapeutics to every aspect of women's health Baker Brown singled out &#145;nervous disease&#146; in women and treated many such patients at his London Surgical Home. In 1866 Baker Brown published his theories and the &#145;successful&#146; results of their application in <span class="italic">On the Curability of Certain Forms of Insanity, Epilepsy, Catalepsy, and Hysteria in Females</span>. Baker Brown identified the cause of these diseases as peripheral excitement of the pudic nerve centring on the clitoris, that is masturbation. The cure was simple. By removing the site of irritation, &#145;unnatural practices&#146; stopped, and the woman regained her health. The extensive list of conditions he included required a greatly expanded estimate of female auto-eroticism.<br>
<br>Baker Brown appealed directly to the lay public, especially women, through speeches and newspaper articles in order to popularize his &#145;special treatment&#146;. Baker Brown carefully presented his new therapy in the most favourable light, neglecting to mention the more negative aspects of clitoridectomy. Reports surfaced that he frequently operated on women ignorant of the nature of the operation or even without their prior consent. Some colleagues welcomed this new cure-all operation, but the majority of the medical community castigated Baker Brown for his publicity seeking and the shocking nature of his claims.<br>
<br>The gynaecological profession as a whole feared a backlash from female patients and their families. The most disturbing repercussion of clitoridectomy was the slur on a respectable woman's moral character. Many practitioners of the day believed in a link between masturbation and physical and mental disease but identified it as a male problem. If Baker Brown was right, thousands of Englishwomen stood accused of &#145;unnatural&#146; vice. Eventually, gynaecologists worried, no respectable woman would consult them for fear of being branded immoral. Numerous physicians rushed to defend female honour and condemn Baker Brown for speaking openly on such a subject.<br>
<br>The final blow to Baker Brown came when the London commissioners for lunacy discovered he had illegally performed clitoridectomy on institutionalized women without the specific consent of family members. At this point, to quell growing public furore, the Obstetrical Society of London decided to hold a hearing on the question of Baker Brown and clitoridectomy. The &#145;trial&#146; of Isaac Baker Brown took place on 3 April 1867 and resulted in his expulsion from the society.<br>
<br>Baker Brown's practice declined rapidly after his repudiation and he never regained his professional standing. His health failed and he was subject to what <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> described as paralytic seizures, becoming a total invalid for the last year of his life. He died at 88 Albany Street, Regent's Park, London, on 3 February 1873. He was survived by his second wife, Catherine Read, whom he married on 21 May 1863 after the death of his first wife, and three young children.<br>
