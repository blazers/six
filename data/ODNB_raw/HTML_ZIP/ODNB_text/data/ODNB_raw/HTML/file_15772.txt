<span class="headword">Knowles,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1606&#150;1685), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born in Lincolnshire. A brilliant scholar, he graduated BA from Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1623 and in 1625 was elected fellow of St Catharine's College, where he proved a successful and popular tutor. In 1627 he proceeded MA and was ordained deacon (18 March) and priest (3 October) at Peterborough. On the advice of the master, Richard Sibbes, he joined in electing to a fellowship at St Catharine's Laud's nominee, John Ellis (1606&#150;1681), an act of compliance which he afterwards bitterly regretted. In 1635 Colchester elected him to the corporation lectureship at St Botolph's. He preached with great fervour and exerted considerable public influence. He delivered the 1636 funeral sermon for his close friend, the great Essex puritan, John Rogers, lecturer of Dedham, and engineered the appointment of his successor, Matthew Newcomen. In 1637 his candidate for the mastership of Colchester grammar school, William Dugard, prevailed over Laud's, but &#145;the getting in of a schoolmaster proved the outing of a lecturer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 605). Knowles's opposition to ceremonies and adamant refusal to communicate at the altar in a mixed multitude led to the revocation of his licence and to his resignation in 1637.<br>
<br>In 1639 Knowles embarked for New England, and in December that year he was called to be co-pastor with George Phillips at Watertown. He married about this time Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29586/', "Thomas Willis")</script>, the famous schoolmaster of Isleworth, Middlesex, and Lynn, Massachusetts, with whom he had two daughters. In 1642 Knowles joined the Harvard board of overseers and on 7 October was one of three ministers sent to Virginia in response to requests from puritan settlers there. Their nonconformity soon led to their silencing and expulsion by the new governor, Sir William Berkeley. Knowles returned in 1643 to Watertown, where he continued to minister, alone after Phillips's death in 1644, and with John Sherman from 1647. In 1650 he became a freeman and on 31 December was a signatory to a letter congratulating Cromwell on his suppression of the Irish uprising.<br>
<br>In 1651 Knowles returned to England and was appointed lecturer in Bristol Cathedral. He was also rector of St Werburgh and pastor of Castle Green congregationalist church, Bristol. In 1654 he was an assistant to the Somerset commission, and in September 1658 was one of the representatives of the congregationalist churches at the Savoy Assembly in London. He was several times barracked by Quakers: on 6 October 1659 his door was assailed with a chopping knife. He claimed credit for eliciting the Dodderidge bequest for Harvard College from a former Bristol recorder.<br>
<br>Deprived at the Restoration, Knowles went to London where he remained until his death. He was briefly lecturer at All Hallows-the-Great in 1661 and 1662 but was forced underground after the 1662 <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. In August 1664 he was reported to be holding &pound;1000 for the benefit of &#145;godly men&#146; and continued to solicit funds for Harvard. He was reported as holding conventicles at various places in London in 1664 and 1665, and courageously continued to minister during the great plague. By 27 October 1671, when he received the freedom of Bristol, he had married his second wife, Deborah, daughter of Thomas Barwicke. The next year an invitation to become president of Harvard coincided with the royal declaration of indulgence, and he declined. Though continuing correspondence, the next year he sold his remaining Massachusetts property. Instead, in the new tolerant atmosphere, he became a colleague of Thomas Kentish in ministering to a presbyterian group in St Katharine by the Tower, afterwards in Eastcheap (ultimately at the king's weighhouse). He had many narrow escapes after the cancelling of the <span class="roman">Act of Indulgence</span> in 1673 and in 1676 was preaching at Booby Lane, Wapping. He died in London on 10 April 1685. By his will, dated from Shadwell, 10 May 1680, he left bequests to his son, Samuel, and daughters Anne (wife of Benjamin Eyre) and Martha (wife of Thomas Impey).<br>
