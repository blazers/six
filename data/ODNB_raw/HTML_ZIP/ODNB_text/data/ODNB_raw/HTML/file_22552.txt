<span class="headword">Port, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1472&#150;1540), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was one of the sons of Henry Port (<i>d</i>. 1512) and his first wife, Anne, daughter of Roger Barrow of Chester. Henry was a mercer in Chester who served as mayor of that city in 1486, and it was probably through a local connection with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26802/', "Richard Sutton")</script> that John was entered at the Inner Temple in the early 1490s; John was later associated with Sutton in various transactions, including the foundation of Brasenose College, Oxford. Port was in practice by 1503, when he is named twice as counsel in the court of requests. By 1509 he was attorney-general in the county palatine of Chester, and surveyor of the honour of Tutbury for the duchy of Lancaster. In 1507 he delivered his first reading in the Inner Temple, and two years later was appointed by Henry VIII as his first solicitor-general. With his new rank he moved to chambers next to the Inner Temple hall, from which central position he played an active part in the life of the inn, serving as its treasurer from 1514 to 1517 and giving a second reading in 1515. By 1521 he was recorder of Nottingham, and in the same year, while involved in the prosecution of the duke of Buckingham for treason, was created a serjeant-at-law. As a serjeant he became an assize commissioner and went to the northern circuit in company with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9602/', "Sir Anthony Fitzherbert (c.1470&#150;1538)")</script>.<br>
<br>As early as 1495 Port settled in Derbyshire as a result of his marriage with Jane (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1520), the widow of John Pole of Radbourn, who was a daughter of John Fitzherbert (<i>d</i>. 1502), king's remembrancer of the exchequer, and a cousin of Anthony Fitzherbert; they had a son, <a href="#cosubject_22553">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and three daughters. His father-in-law settled upon him the estate in Etwall where he established his seat. Although his father continued to live in Chester, John Port erected a monument to him in Etwall church displaying the family's new arms granted in 1506. Port served as a justice of the peace for Derbyshire from 1502, acquiring extensive properties in that county and, to a lesser extent, in Nottinghamshire. In the 1520s he married as his second wife Margery, daughter of Sir Edmund Trafford, widow of Sir Thomas Gerard (<i>d</i>. 1523); she died childless in May 1540. In his lifetime Sir John gave Brasenose College an endowment for scholarships, which were restricted in favour of Port's kinsmen until 1854, a garden, and vestments for the chapel; his arms, impaling Fitzherbert, were once displayed in the windows of the college hall.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1525 Port was appointed one of the justices of the king's bench, apparently as an additional member of the court, and also became a member of Princess Mary's council in the marches, changing his circuit to the western. He was knighted soon afterwards. His correspondence with Cromwell as an assize judge seems to a modern reader improperly subservient, but it was usual for the government to keep in close touch with the judges on circuit as one of their principal means of obtaining and transmitting information. Port remained a judge for fifteen years, and from 1533 was the secondary justice of his court. His most famous judgment does not reflect well on his boldness; according to Spelman, he spoke so softly in <i>Lord Dacre's Case</i> (1535) that he was counted on the wrong side, thereby giving the crown a bare majority. Whether or not his inaudibility was politically calculated, Port's mumbling altered the whole course of the law concerning uses. In another case, in 1536, Spelman rather critically noted that Port drew a distinction without giving any reason and that all the other judges took a contrary view. During the Lent assize of 1540 Port was taken ill at Worcester and carried to Bewdley, where he died on or about 14 March. In accordance with his will, he was buried at Etwall, Derbyshire. An effigy in bas-relief, between those of his two wives, was erected in the church there; he wears judicial robes with a collar (perhaps a collar of SS) underneath the mantle, but the face and hands have been broken off.<br>
<br>In 1979 Port's previously unrecorded autograph notebook was purchased at auction by the Huntington Library. Besides miscellaneous collections, it contains an alphabetical digest of cases from Westminster Hall and other legal notes, beginning around 1493, notes of dicta at readings and moots in the Inner Temple from at least 1494, notes of readings in the same inn from 1497 to 1503, and reports in the king's bench for Michaelmas term 1529 and Hilary term 1530. Unlike other contemporary reporters, such as Caryll and Spelman, Port kept his best reports in his student days. There is a smattering of later cases, including one in which we hear Wolsey speaking in the Star Chamber, but those from his period as a judge are not particularly illuminating. The principal interest of the manuscript is that it is the earliest collection of law reports written by an identifiable hand. The most important of its contents were published in 1986.<br>
<br>Port's granddaughter Jane married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69365/', "Richard Harpur")</script>, who also became a bencher of the Inner Temple, a judge, and a law reporter. Port's only son, <a name="cosubject_22553"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Port</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1510, <em>d.</em> 1557)<span class="occ"></span>, was born shortly before 1510 and went to Brasenose College in 1524 on his father's foundation, proceeding to the Inner Temple at his father's instance in 1528. He entered Cromwell's service, and in 1547 was created a knight of the Bath. Twice, in 1539 and 1553, he represented Derbyshire in parliament. He married in 1531 Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Giffard, and second, Dorothy, daughter of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, and widow of Sir Ralph Longford (<i>d</i>. 1543). On 6 June 1557 he died without male issue. His two sons had died in infancy, and his estates were partitioned in 1565 between his three daughters, one of whom, Dorothy, married George Hastings (<i>d</i>. 1604) who inherited the earldom of Huntingdon in 1595. By his will he left &pound;200 to Brasenose College to build chambers and found lectureships in philosophy and humanity &#145;according to my father's old wisshing and devise&#146;, and left part of his patrimony to provide almshouses at Etwall and to found Repton School, where the scholars every day were to pray for the souls of his parents and other relatives.<br>
