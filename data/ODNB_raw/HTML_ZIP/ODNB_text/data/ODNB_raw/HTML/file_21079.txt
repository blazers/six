<span class="headword">Paddock <span class="st"> [Padock]</span>,  Tom</span>  (1822&#150;1863), <span class="occ">pugilist</span>, was born near Redditch, Worcestershire, and baptized at St Stephen's Church, Redditch, on 25 August 1822, the son of George Padock, a labourer, and his wife, Elizabeth. His place of origin earned him the sobriquet of the Redditch Needle-pointer. A burly, pugnacious farm boy, he developed a taste for boxing and became a strong, enduring, and resolute fighter, but never attained to the first rank as a scientific boxer. When his professional career commenced in 1844 his height was 5 feet 10&frac12; inches, and his fighting weight was 12 stone. His career progressed steadily, if unspectacularly, interrupted by ten months' hard labour at Derby in 1852, when police intervention at his fight with Harry Poulson was riotously opposed.<br>
<br>In 1850 Paddock was defeated by William Thompson (Bendigo), a very shifty performer, who was declared winner in consequence of a foul blow which his conduct had invited. Five years later Paddock arguably became champion of England through default of Harry Broome, but he was not generally recognized and forfeited the position next year (1856) to Bill Perry (the Tipton Slasher). He made two unsuccessful attempts to regain the title. Paddock had for a long time been ambitious to fight Tom Sayers, but before the arrangements for the meeting had been finalized Paddock fell ill. Sayers visited him in the hospital and, on learning that he was poor, generously gave him &pound;5. On his recovery Paddock renewed his application to fight Sayers for the championship; but as he was unable to raise the usual stake of &pound;200 he appealed to his opponent to waive &pound;50, a request that was at once granted. The fight took place on 16 June 1858, and Paddock was defeated in twenty-one rounds, which occupied an hour and twenty minutes. In the last round Sayers delivered a crushing blow with his left and drew back his right hand to complete the victory; but seeing his adversary staggering forward at his mercy, instead of hitting he offered his right hand in friendship, and led him to his seconds, who accepted defeat.<br>
<br>Paddock's last fight took place in 1860 (when he was unfortunately suffering from a knife wound). His opponent was the gigantic Sam Hurst, who gained the victory by a chance blow. Paddock died of heart disease on 30 June 1863 at 22 Upper Rathbone Place, London, and was buried at Finchley on 5 July. His widow died four days later.<br>
