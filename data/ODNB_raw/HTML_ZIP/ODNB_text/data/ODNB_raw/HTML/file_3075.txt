<span class="headword">Bowly,  Samuel</span>  (1802&#150;1884), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist and temperance advocate</span>, the son of Samuel Bowly, a miller at Bibury, Gloucestershire, was born in Cirencester on 23 March 1802. During his youth he attended a Quaker school at Nailsworth and then worked at his father's flour mill. In 1827 he married Jane Shipley, the daughter of John Shipley of Shaftesbury. In 1829 Bowly moved to Gloucester and set up business as a cheese factor. He became chairman of many local banking, gas, railway, and other companies, and for the last twenty years of his life he was looked upon as a leader in commercial circles and affairs. An active participant in the agitation against the corn laws, he also opposed all taxes on essential items. It was one of his endeavours to give the people cheap and universal education, and he was not only one of the founders of the British and ragged schools in Gloucester, but a consistent advocate of a national system. During the early stages of the Crimean War he became involved in the peace movement. Like his father, he belonged to the Society of Friends; throughout the 1850s he spoke at the yearly meetings and in 1863 he was made a minister.<br>
<br>Bowly took an active part in the anti-slavery movement. An effective public speaker, on several occasions he debated with the pro-slavery lecturer Peter Borthwick. He was one of the deputation which went to Downing Street on 14 November 1837 to interview Lord Melbourne concerning the cruelties exercised towards the slaves under the apprenticeship system introduced in 1834, and the following year he took an active part in the formation of the Central Negro Emancipation Committee, which was ultimately instrumental in bringing about full emancipation in 1838.<br>
<br>It was his advocacy of temperance which made Bowly best known. On 30 December 1835 he signed the pledge of total abstinence, and went on to help establish temperance societies and Bands of Hope in the villages around Gloucester. He promoted temperance among the members of his own religious society, and in 1851 he helped found the Friends' Temperance Union. As the leading amateur temperance lecturer in the 1850s and 1860s he specialized in addressing the affluent in drawing-room meetings. Bowly was president of the National Temperance League, a director of the London Temperance Hospital from its foundation, and a director of the United Kingdom Temperance and General Provident Institution, in which roles he was able to draw the attention of scientific men to the damaging physical effects of alcohol. On behalf of the National Temperance League he attended and addressed 107 meetings during the last year of his life, travelling many hundreds of miles. Although he chaired the first public meeting of the United Kingdom Alliance in October 1853, he later moved away from the advocacy of prohibition.<br>
<br>Bowly's first wife, Jane, died in 1868; on 6 August 1873, in Devizes, he married Louisa Cotterell, the widow of Jacob Henry Cotterell of Bath, especially known for his connection with the Rechabite Friendly Society. Bowly published several addresses on anti-slavery and temperance themes, including <span class="italic">Total Abstinence and its Proper Place</span> (1863). The eightieth anniversary of his birth was celebrated in Gloucester in 1882, and he died there on Sunday, 23 March 1884, his eighty-second birthday. He was buried at Gloucester on 27 March.<br>
