<span class="headword">Shepard,  Thomas</span>  (1635&#150;1677), <span class="occ">Congregational minister in America</span>, was born in London on 5 April 1635, the second son, and first surviving child, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25325/', "Thomas Shepard (1605&#150;1649)")</script> and his first wife, Margaret Touteville (<i>d</i>. 1636). He emigrated with his parents from England to the Massachusetts Bay colony on 10 August 1635. His mother died in February 1636, the same month as he was baptized&#151;about 7 February&#151;into the church at Newtown (later Cambridge) of which his father had just been appointed the first pastor. Shepard graduated BA from Harvard College in 1653, and was chosen as a fellow of the college on 27 November 1654. He retained this fellowship until 15 September 1673, when he resigned during a controversy over the appointment of Leonard Hoar as president of the college. Shepard took up his fellowship again on 15 March 1674, the day Hoar resigned.<br>
<br>Shepard married Hannah 
    (or Anna; 1640&#150;1709)
  , daughter of William Tyng, a magistrate of the Massachusetts Bay colony, about 3 November 1656. They had two children: Thomas Shepard, born on 3 July 1658, who would succeed his father as a minister in the Charlestown, Massachusetts, church; and Anna, born on 13 September 1663. On 13 April 1659 Shepard was ordained a minister in the Charlestown church where he taught as a colleague of the Revd Zechariah Symmes. Shepard consistently represented what might be described as the conservative establishment interests in colonial religious politics. He was appointed a censor of the press on 19 October 1664. During the controversy over baptism in 1668, Shepard and Symmes stood with those who called for leaders among the Baptist congregations to be either exiled or imprisoned.<br>
<br>In the 1672 Massachusetts annual election sermon Shepard spoke eloquently for a balanced view of toleration, saying: &#145;To tolerate all things, and to tolerate nothing, (it's an old and true Maxime) both are intolerable: but 'tis Satan's policy to plead for an indefinite and boundless toleration&#146;  (Sibley, 328). Shepard demonstrated his conception of a more appropriate toleration by praising an earlier generation of New England colonists for using their coercive powers to crush &#145;in the very Egg&#146; the brood of &#145;poysonful, fiery, stinging Serpents&#146; who threatened the religious purity of the church  (Miller, <span class="italic">The New England Mind</span>, 132). As the historian Peter Carroll has observed: &#145;Thomas Shepard declared that the existence of doctrinal purity within the New England churches constituted a wall which separated &hellip; the saint from the sinner. By excluding the unregenerate, this shield defended the godly churches from the onslaught of disbelievers&#146;  (Carroll, 109). Toleration must, in Shepard's view, serve and be limited by the interests of ecclesiastical purity.<br>
<br>Shepard's most important literary product, <span class="italic">Eye-salve, or, A watch-word from our Lord Jesus Christ unto his churches: especially those within the colony of the Massachsets in New England, to take heed of apostacy</span> (1673), warned readers that God's protection of them in the perilous and isolated land of New England was jeopardized by the impurity of their faith. Building on his exposition of &#145;the Church of God&#146; in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, he writes:<blockquote>That the undeniable experience which the Covenant people of God have had of the Lord's being to them not a wilderness nor a land of Darkness, but the contrary, should caution them never to incur the guilt of so unreasonable a sin and dangerous folly, and provocation as to revolt from under the Lord, or to be unwilling to return again in case they have begun to decline from him. (<span class="italic">Eye-Salve</span>, 8)</blockquote>The themes Shepard touched upon in this book were common among contemporaries in the second generation of New England religious leadership, such as John Higginson, William Stoughton, Urian Oakes, and Increase Mather, reflecting, as the great historian of New England puritanism Perry Miller wrote, &#145;a deep disquietude&#146; a fear that &#145;something has gone wrong&#146; with their holy social experiment  (Miller, <span class="italic">Errand into the Wilderness</span>, 2).<br>
<br>Shepard, like his father, who took up the cause of the elders of the Massachusetts Bay colony against John Cotton and Anne Hutchinson in the antinomian controversy of 1636&#150;8, was an energetic and courageous controversialist, praised posthumously by his friend Urian Oakes, in &#145;An Elegy upon the Death of the Reverend Mr. Thomas Shepard&#146;, as<blockquote>
<div>Our wrestling Israel, second unto none<br>
</div>
<div>The man that stood i'th'gap, to keep the pass.<br>
</div> (Miller and Johnson, 644)</blockquote>Remembered primarily for his opposition to religious impurity, which he saw as a threat to the survival of the New England churches, Shepard died in Charlestown on 22 December 1677 at the age of forty-two, having contracted smallpox from a dying parishioner who had requested a pastoral visit.<br>
