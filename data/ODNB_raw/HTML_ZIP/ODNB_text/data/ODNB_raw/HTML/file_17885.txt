<span class="headword">Malkin,  Benjamin Heath</span>  (1769&#150;1842), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and antiquary</span>, only son of Thomas Malkin of St Mary-le-Bow and his wife, whose maiden name was Heath, was born on 23 March 1769 in London. He was educated from 1779 to 1787 at Harrow School, where he was head of the school in 1787. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 5 January 1788 and graduated BA in 1792. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 3 February 1791. He married <i>c</i>.1794 Charlotte, the daughter of the Revd Thomas Williams, curate of Cowbridge, Glamorgan, and master of Cowbridge grammar school.<br>
<br>As a young lawyer in London, Malkin made the acquaintance of William Blake, with whom he shared an interest in radical politics, and in 1806 he commissioned Blake to design and engrave the frontispiece of his book <span class="italic">A Father's Memoir of his Child</span>, a personal record of his eldest son, Thomas, a gifted child who died in 1802 at the age of six. The published engraving, though designed by Blake, was eventually executed by R. H. Cromek (1770&#150;1812). The introduction to the work, dedicated to Thomas Johnes of Hafod (1748&#150;1816), is valuable as the first and fullest account of Blake's early life and it included a selection of Blake's poems, which it brought to the attention of the general public for the first time. Blake contributed an appreciation of the child's precocious artistic talents. Malkin did much to promote Blake's career and is thought to have been the author of the texts accompanying the latter's plates for Robert Blair's <span class="italic">The Grave</span> (1808). An illuminated manuscript copy of the <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence</span>, presented by the author to Malkin and given by him to Johnes, is preserved in the Beinecke Library at Yale University.<br>
<br>From 1809 to 1828 Malkin was headmaster of the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds, where his pupils included Edward Fitzgerald, John Mitchell Kemble, and James Spedding (1808&#150;1881). The last mentioned was later to pay a warm tribute to Malkin as an inspiring and liberal, if idiosyncratic, teacher who encouraged independence of mind and character. The attention he gave in the curriculum to essay-writing and the study of English literature was unusual for the time.<br>
<br>In March 1810 Malkin was awarded the degree of DCL by the University of Oxford, having previously been incorporated of St Mary Hall. In December 1829 he was appointed to be the first professor of history, ancient and modern, at the newly established University of London, and his inaugural lecture was published the following year, but he resigned before the end of the academic session. His wide interests are reflected in the range of his publications. His tragedy <span class="italic">Almahide and Hamet</span> (1804), based on Dryden's <span class="italic">Conquest of Granada</span> (1669), was never acted but was praised for its introductory &#145;Letter on dramatic composition&#146;. In addition to historical work such as <span class="italic">Classical Disquisitions and Curiosities</span> (1825) he published in translation <span class="italic">The Adventures of Gil Blas</span> (4 vols., 1809), illustrated by Robert Smirke, which was frequently reprinted. Malkin's taste for the picturesque is to be seen in his topographical work <span class="italic">The Scenery, Antiquities and Biography of South Wales</span>, published in 1804 and reissued in a two-volume edition in 1807. Written after a tour of south Wales in 1803, it was one of the best travel books of its kind, displaying Malkin's acute observation and considerable knowledge of Welsh history. From about 1830 Malkin lived at the Old Hall, Cowbridge, and took a keen interest in the Glamorgan community. He founded the Society for the Improvement of the Working Population in Glamorgan, for which he edited pamphlets and acted as president and secretary.<br>
<br>Malkin died at Cowbridge on 26 May 1842, and was buried there. A monument was erected to his memory in the church of St James, Bury St Edmunds, with an inscription attesting to the affectionate respect in which he was held by his former pupils. He and his wife had four sons besides Thomas. The eldest, Sir Benjamin Heath Malkin (1797&#150;1837), a friend of Macaulay, was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and later a judge of the supreme court at Calcutta. Frederick (1802&#150;1830), also a fellow of Trinity, was the author of a <span class="italic">History of Greece</span> (1830), while Arthur (1803&#150;1888), a contemporary and friend of Fitzgerald and Spedding, was a pioneer alpinist. Charles Johnes (1808&#150;1825) died young.<br>
