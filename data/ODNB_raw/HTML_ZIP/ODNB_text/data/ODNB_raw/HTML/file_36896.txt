<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilde,  William James <span class="st"> [Jimmy]</span></span>  (1892&#150;1969), <span class="occ">boxer</span>, was born on 12 May 1892 at 8 Station Road, Pont-y-gwaith, in the parish of Craig Berth-lwyd, near Tylorstown in south Wales, the son of James Wilde, a coalminer, and his wife, Margaret Ann Evans, a miner's daughter. Known from birth as Jimmy, he was the second child, with an elder sister named Mary Anne and several younger than himself. After being educated at a local council school, he was able to leave school at the age of thirteen by passing a modest examination that gave him a labour certificate, and he went to work in the pits as a boy-helper at the rate of half a crown per day. To add to the family budget and to find the money to buy a few luxuries, such as cigarettes, he engaged in boxing bouts at the fairground booths, for which he received 5<i>s</i>. if he won. As he was rarely defeated in this hazardous profession after an arduous week in the pits, he soon built up a reputation for himself as a glove fighter under the marquess of Queensberry rules, but also took part in illegal bare-fist contests staged in secret in the Welsh mountains on a Sunday.<br>
<br>Just before his nineteenth birthday Wilde had become a star performer in Welsh rings and decided to leave the mines and devote his whole time to a boxing career. By now he had married Elizabeth Davies, daughter of Dai Davies, a miner under whom Wilde had served in his apprentice days in the pits. Himself an ardent boxer, Davies had coached Jimmy and taught him the rudiments in the small confines of his bedroom. Wilde's marriage took place at Pont-y-gwaith in 1910 and two sons were subsequently born: David, who later took up boxing, and Verdun, who had no inclination for the sport. Wilde reigned as undisputed flyweight champion of the world from 24 April 1916 until 18 June 1923, and although the weight limit for his class was 8 stone, he never went to scale at more than 6 stone 10 pounds, which meant that he was always called upon to meet opponents far bigger and heavier than himself. Among heavyweights the difference of a stone does not present anything like the handicap that it does among smaller men. Although he did not weigh much, Wilde possessed long legs and arms, with powerful shoulder muscles. He moved fast and punched with devastating power; his defence was confined to unorthodox bobbing and swaying that made him a difficult target to hit with any accuracy. He owed his amazing muscular development to his early days as a miner when, because of his small size, he could squeeze himself into the narrowest seam to hack away at the coal-face with his pickaxe.<br>
<br>Wilde's last paysheet at the Ferndale no. 8 pit owned by D. Davies &amp; Sons Ltd, dated 1 April 1911, showed him earning the sum of &pound;6 7<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. for a fortnight's work, from which was deducted 1<i>s</i>. due to his check-weigher and 1<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. for the services of a doctor, leaving a total of &pound;6 5<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. from which he had to pay his &#145;boy&#146; 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a day. It was not much on which to buy a house and bring up a family&#151;hence Wilde's decision to become a professional boxer. In the next twelve years he was to earn thousands of pounds with his fistic talent. By 1911 Wilde could claim, without risk of repudiation, that he had taken part in over 800 contests, but from 1911 until his retirement in 1923 his official record shows 138 well-paid bouts, which included seven British or world title contests, and the winning outright of a Lord Lonsdale challenge belt. Seventy-eight of his contests during this period, mostly against bantamweights and featherweights, ended within the scheduled number of rounds, and his phenomenal punching power earned him such colourful names as the Mighty Atom, the Tylorstown Terror, and the Ghost with a Hammer in his Hands. He became a great favourite in the principal boxing arenas throughout the country, especially at the famous National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London; at the height of his fame his name became a household word. In a triumphant tour of America, from 1919 to 1920, he earned $100,000. He was beaten only four times: once when he fought against doctor's orders, once by a disputed decision, once by an American far heavier than himself, and in the final defence of his world title in New York against the Filipino Pancho Villa, who at twenty-two was Wilde's junior by nine years. For this contest Wilde received his largest purse, of &pound;13,000.<br>
<br>On returning to Britain, Wilde announced his retirement from active boxing, but he continued to be interested in the sport, both as a manager of boxers and as a promoter of boxing tournaments. He died at Whitchurch Hospital in Cardiff, on 10 March 1969, just two months before his seventy-seventh birthday. The cause of death was given as acute influenza and severe mental abnormality.<br>
