<span class="headword">Toms,  Isaac</span>  (1710&#150;1801), <span class="occ">Independent minister and writer</span>, was born on 22 August 1710 in London, son of Philip Toms, a mercer in the Royal Exchange, and his wife, Elizabeth Kempster. His paternal grandfather was Peter Toms (<i>d</i>. 1686), a mercer of Plymouth; his maternal grandfather was John Kempster (<i>d</i>. 1692), vicar of Brixham, Devon, from 1651 until his ejection in 1662. His elder brother John was a druggist in London, and his sister married a Mr Slater.<br>
<br>At the age of nine Toms was sent to the grammar school at Dukinfield, near Manchester, for four years, and then for a further four years to St Paul's School, London. At this time he attended anatomical lectures at Gresham College. Though his father hoped to bring him up to trade, he chose to prepare for the ministry, and entered himself as a student of Thomas Ridgley and John Eames at the dissenting academy at Moorfields. He continued his studies while living in the family of Sir Daniel Dolins in Hackney, as chaplain and private tutor to Dolins's son. This was a very demanding appointment: Toms spent eight hours a day reading to young Dolins, who had defective sight, and in order to attend lectures at the academy he had to rise at 4 a.m. He took Dolins through a course on the principles of natural and revealed religion, and himself became proficient in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, mathematics, and experimental philosophy. He stayed on after concluding his course at the academy, and spent a total of eleven years in Sir Daniel's family until young Dolins's death in 1742. Dolins, who had wished to buy an estate in the country and build a chapel there, left his tutor &pound;700 and all his books.<br>
<br>Toms had occasionally occupied pulpits in and around London, but he now wanted to minister to his own congregation. He turned down the offer of a valuable Church of England living belonging to the Bedford family&#151;&#145;he was a dissenter upon conviction&#146;  (Ray, 33)&#151;and accepted an invitation to settle in Hadleigh in Suffolk, with the small annual stipend of &pound;30. He began his ministry in 1743 or 1744, was ordained on 31 July 1745, and spent the rest of his life in this post. His success meant that a new gallery had to be added to the meeting house. He was engaged in a wide range of preaching, educational, and charitable activities: until 1785 he preached twice on Sundays and frequently on other days; he catechized on Monday mornings, inviting children of all denominations; he established lectures and schools for poor children in the neighbouring villages; he distributed books, medicine, food, fuel, and money to the villagers. &#145;He was at all times easy of access&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>, May 1801, 179). No doubt these activities were made possible by his legacy from Dolins, who had specifically left money for the distribution of religious books. He did much to spread knowledge of the cruel treatment of protestants by priests, magistrates, and soldiers in France. A French pastor, Jacob Bourdillon&#151;spelled Boudillon by Ray&#151;provided an annual account for him, which he circulated. Toms tried to persuade the Independent minister at Northampton, Philip Doddridge, to lead a national response by dissenters, but Doddridge explained in a helpful letter of 2 February 1751 that he was prevented by illness from doing so.<br>
<br>Toms wrote a number of popular religious tracts. He was closely involved with the work of the Society for Promoting Religious Knowledge among the Poor, founded in 1750, and he regularly sent letters to the society describing the villagers' reception of their books. Five of his anonymous tracts published in the 1740s&#151;<span class="italic">An Humble Attempt to Assist Parents and Masters in the Religious Instruction of Youth</span>, <span class="italic">The Swearer's Monitor</span>, <span class="italic">The Sabbath-Breaker's Monitor</span>, <span class="italic">The Intemperate Person's Monitor</span>, and <span class="italic">The Lewd Person's Monitor</span>&#151;were very widely distributed by the society, totalling 51,375 copies by 1797 (publishers' advertisements and the society's annual <span class="italic">Accounts</span> identify his authorship). His books and pamphlets were sold very cheaply, often for a few pence, with discounts for those buying them for free distribution. The most interesting of his more ambitious works are <span class="italic">The Shining Convert</span> (1747), an account of the paralysed illiterate farm labourer Thomas Seeger, with a preface suggesting how to make devotional writing attractive, and <span class="italic">The Christian Instructor</span> (1748), which digests the fruits of his education at the Moorfields academy on natural and revealed religion for the benefit of masters of families and youth destined for business. He also published several anti-Catholic works. His many unpublished (and barely legible) hymns and poems survive in manuscript in Dr Williams's Library.<br>
<br>Toms married Sarah Say (<i>d</i>. 1799), the daughter of Samuel Say (1676&#150;1743), the Independent minister at Westminster. They had four surviving children: Sarah (1749&#150;1809); Samuel Say (1750&#150;1834), minister at Framlingham, who became a Unitarian; Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1831), who married after her father's death Daniel Fisher, tutor at Homerton Academy; and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1819). In old age Toms was assisted for a while in his ministerial duties by William Gunn, who then moved to Towcester, Northamptonshire, as minister in 1796 and returned to succeed Toms as minister at Hadleigh in 1800. Toms was still conducting the afternoon service until the end of 1798. He died in early January 1801, having been effectively a prisoner in his own house for three months. His funeral sermon, published as <span class="italic">An Old Disciple</span>, was preached at Hadleigh on 15 January by John Mead Ray (1753&#150;1837), Independent minister at Sudbury. (Ray gives the date of his death as 2 January, while the obituary in the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> gives 12 January.)<br>
<br>Toms was a great admirer of the stars of &#145;the last age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shining Convert</span>, viii), and had a picture of Richard Baxter over his desk, but he also had a lively interest in recent philosophy and physico-theology, and in writers associated with the evangelical revival. His publications and charitable work indicate his commitment to the education of the poor and his confidence that the rational basis of Christian belief could be plainly demonstrated.<br>
