<span class="headword">Ferrerio,  Giovanni</span> <span class="st"> [Joannes Ferrerius]</span>  (1502&#150;1579), <span class="occ">historian and humanist writer</span>, was born on 25 March 1502 in Riva di Chieri, near Turin, the son of Martino Ferrerio and Caterina Finelli. His father was distantly related to the episcopal family of Ivrea and Vercelli, but Giovanni did not look for a place in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Having been educated in Chieri (1507?&#150;1515?) and Turin (1515?&#150;1525), he enrolled at the University of Paris in 1525. There he met Hector Boece and George Buchanan, and also Robert Reid, then abbot-designate of the Cistercian monastery of Kinloss. In 1528 Ferrerio accompanied Reid to Scotland, where he spent three years at the court of James V. During this time he dedicated a work to James, <span class="italic">De vera cometae significatione</span>, printed in Paris in 1540. However, court life did not suit Ferrerio and in 1531 he moved to Kinloss Abbey, both to undertake private study and to act as tutor to the monks.<br>
<br>After seven years at Kinloss, Ferrerio decided to return to Italy. In 1537 he was in Piedmont, but he then lived for three years in Paris (1538&#150;41). Under the Latin name of Joannes Ferrerius he became concerned with the printing of humanist works and acted as a corrector to Vascosan, the university publisher and bookseller. He also continued to write, contributing prefaces to some works, such as Mirandola's <span class="italic">De animorum immortalitate</span> (1541), and composing some books himself, such as <span class="italic">Academica de animarum immortalitate</span> (1539), <span class="italic">Auditum visu praestate, contra vulgatum Aristotelis placitum academica</span> (1539), and <span class="italic">Cicero, poeta etiam elegans nedum ineptum fuisse</span> (1540). At Easter 1541 Reid persuaded Ferrerio to return to Kinloss, settling on him a lifelong pension of &pound;40 Scots, a servant, and two horses. Ferrerio resumed his teaching duties; among his pupils this time were five monks from the neighbouring Cistercian house of Beauly. He gave general lectures to the whole monastery and offered private tutoring to selected monks. His aim was to teach eloquence by examining approved texts. Those used for his lectures included some of Cicero's philosophical treatises, for example <span class="italic">De officiis</span> and <span class="italic">Somnium Scipionis</span>. Ferrerio's tutoring developed the lectures and discussed such other writers as Terence and Virgil. Rhetorical and grammatical theory was studied, using texts ranging from Quintilian and Cicero to Valla and Melancthon.<br>
<br>While Ferrerio seems to have been popular in Scotland and also to have been impressed with the scholarship he found there, the instability of the realm, and possibly its incipient protestantism after the death of James V, drove him back to Paris in 1545. He remained interested in Scotland, however, and attempted to collect biological material from Scotland for Conrad Gesner, although the Scottish political situation meant that his queries often went unanswered. In 1550, despite his personal liking for George Buchanan, Ferrerio's evidence was partly responsible for Buchanan's arrest for heresy in Portugal. This may have recommended him to at least one Scottish Catholic family, for by 1553 Ferrerio appears to have been acting as guardian for the sons (officially &#145;nephews&#146;) of Cardinal Beaton, since Marion Ogilvie, the cardinal's mistress and mother of his children, authorized substantial payments to Ferrerio that year.<br>
<br>Ferrerio's most important link with Scotland, however, was historiographical. During his stay at Kinloss he had composed the life of Thomas Crystall, the abbot&#150;administrator of the abbey, which was finished in 1535, the year of Crystall's death; he then went on to write an account of earlier abbots, the <span class="italic">Historia abbatum de Kynlos</span> (completed in 1537). Ferrerio's life of Crystall is hagiographic, and for the earlier history of Kinloss he was plagued by a lack of sources beyond the abbey's own records, but these allowances made, the works are informative and models of good Latin style. Ferrerio also contributed Scottish material for Carion's <span class="italic">Chronici ab orbe condito</span> (1551; reprinted until 1563). Such expertise made him entirely suitable for the task of producing an extended edition of Hector Boece's <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> (1574&#150;5; distributed in Paris by Jacques Dupuy). This contains two further books by Boece, left unfinished at his death in 1536, together with Ferrerio's summary of the reign of James III, which completes book 19. In his preface to the additional material Ferrerio says that numerous people urged him to the undertaking; the most importunate of these was Henry Sinclair, the dean of Glasgow. Sinclair was a notable collector of historical manuscripts, and may have numbered Boece's additional books among them, although Ferrerio may equally have possessed them, since he knew Boece well. Sinclair had even begun to prepare his own account of later medieval Scotland, but died in 1565 before this was complete. It was presumably upon this that Ferrerio based his own supplementary narrative, but it is impossible to identify particular sources within the latter.<br>
<br>Ferrerio died in Paris in 1579, after a distinguished career as scholar and teacher. While his activities in publishing in Paris contributed to the development of humanism on the continent, his work in and about Scotland had a greater impact, at least within that small realm. His welcome at court suggests that James V, although not famed as an intellectual, was not antagonistic to the new movements. Ferrerio's teaching in Scotland spread humanist methods of study and in his own writing he advanced the place of Scottish historiography. In republishing the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> he found a new audience for Boece's interpretation of the Scottish past, and perhaps facilitated the reception of the subsequent histories of Buchanan and John Lesley; his supplement to the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> offers an interpretation of James III as a grasping monarch under the influence of favourites, a reputation which historians began to modify only late in the twentieth century.<br>
