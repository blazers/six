<span class="headword">Tindal,  Nicholas</span>  (1687&#150;1774), <span class="occ">historical writer and translator</span>, was born on 25 November 1687 at Plymouth, the only son of John Tindal, vicar of Cornwood, Devon, and his wife, Elizabeth Prideaux. His uncle was the deist Matthew Tindal (1657&#150;1733), and his aunt Elizabeth was the mother of Nathaniel Forster (1718&#150;1757). He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 6 March 1707, graduated BA in 1710, and proceeded MA in 1713. On 29 January 1710 he married Anne Keate (<i>bap</i>. 1681) of Hagbourne, Berkshire; they had three sons, John, George, and James. In 1716 Tindal was presented to the rectory of Hatford, Berkshire, and in 1722 to the vicarage of Great Waltham, Essex.<br>
<br>Tindal's first published work was a translation of Augustin Calmet's <span class="italic">Antiquities Sacred and Profane</span> (1724). Soon afterwards the booksellers James and John Knapton began to publish Tindal's translation of Paul de Rapin Thoyras's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (originally published in French, 1723&#150;5). His translation, with notes, appeared in fifteen octavo volumes from 1725 to 1731. Tindal began the work at Great Waltham but continued his translation while serving as a chaplain in the navy. The second volume was dedicated on 12 July 1726 to Sir Charles Wager, to whom Tindal was then acting as chaplain in the Baltic, and the fourth was dated &#145;on board the <i>Torbay</i> in Gibraltar Bay, Sep. 4, 1727&#146;. A second edition was brought out in 1732&#150;3, and a third in 1743.<br>
<br>Tindal then wrote a <span class="italic">Continuation</span> of Rapin's <span class="italic">History of England</span> from the revolution of 1688 to the accession of George II in 1727. The first volume was published in 1744, and the second in 1745 (numbered as the third and fourth volume of Rapin's <span class="italic">History</span>). The work subsequently appeared in numerous forms, including an <span class="italic">Abridgement</span> (1747) and a <span class="italic">Summary</span> (1751). Through copious footnotes and politicized prefaces Tindal was an important contributor to the remarkable success of Rapin's <span class="italic">History</span>. His footnotes added extra topical detail and recounted well-known legends about English history. They also incorporated political criticisms of church history and revealed religion. Tindal's dedications to Frederick, prince of Wales (1732), and to the duke of Cumberland (1745), both attempted to show how Rapin's <span class="italic">History</span> could inform understanding of contemporary politics.<br>
<br>Tindal's <span class="italic">Continuation</span> incorporated Rapin's conceptual framework of the ancient Saxon constitution and the necessity of limiting royal power, and applied it to English history since the revolution of 1688. Tindal lacks some of Rapin's narrative flair, and relies on lengthy quotation, but one nineteenth-century commentator found Tindal's work &#145;a temperate and candid narrative of carefully ascertained facts&#146;  (Gardiner and Mullinger, 375). It also, according to Burton, became the authoritative work for the history of Queen Anne's reign. The work's detractors, however, doubted Tindal's authorship or suggested political interference, while William Duncombe published an anonymous attack on Tindal's style, <span class="italic">Remarks on Mr. Tindal's Translation</span> (1728).<br>
<br>While vicar of Waltham, Tindal also wrote a scrappy <span class="italic">History of Essex</span> (<i>c</i>.1732) based upon the manuscripts of William Holman, which was nevertheless an important precursor to the work by his close friend and correspondent, Philip Morant. In 1731 he was appointed master of the Royal Free School at Chelmsford, and in 1732 chaplain-in-ordinary at Chatham. Following the death of his uncle, Matthew Tindal, in 1733, he became embroiled in a very public dispute with Eustace Budgell over the will, which Tindal believed had been forged by Budgell and had robbed him of his inheritance. Tindal published his case in <span class="italic">A Copy of the Will of Matthew Tindal &hellip;</span> (1733), but he failed to obtain restitution from Budgell.<br>
<br>In 1738 Tindal was appointed chaplain to Greenwich Hospital, and in 1740 he was presented to the rectories of Calbourne, Isle of Wight, and Alverstoke, Hampshire. In 1764 he published <span class="italic">A Guide to Classical Learning, or, Polymetis Abridged</span>, which proved a very popular handbook, and subsequent editions appeared in 1765, 1777, 1786, and 1802, all in duodecimo. Tindal was married again, on 11 August 1753 at the chapel of Greenwich Hospital; his second wife was Elizabeth Judith Gugelman. He died at Greenwich Hospital on 27 June 1774, in his eighty-seventh year, and was buried on 2 July 1774 in the second burial-ground of the hospital, known as Goddard's Garden.<br>
