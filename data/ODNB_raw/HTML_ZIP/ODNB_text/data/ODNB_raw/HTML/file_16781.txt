<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Littleton,  Edward</span>, Baron Littleton  (1589&#150;1645), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, came from a prodigious legal background. His family were descendants of the younger son of the famous fifteenth-century judge and writer on tenures, Sir Thomas Littleton. Born at Mounslow, Shropshire, in 1589, Edward was the eldest son of Sir Edward Littleton of Henley, chief justice of north Wales, and Mary, daughter of Edmund Walter, chief justice of south Wales. After entering Oxford as a gentleman commoner of Christ Church on 28 November 1606, he took a BA degree on 28 April 1609. Admitted to the Inner Temple in London in 1608 he was called to the bar there in 1617. Littleton was a close friend of the famous jurist John Selden, and was said by Clarendon to have taken &#145;great pains in the hardest and most knotty part of the law&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.&sect;204), suggesting that he was expert in records as well as book learning. Among lawyers in his generation he was widely regarded as &#145;the best antiquary of the profession who gave himself to practice&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Littleton's early public career was associated with Wales and the border counties, where he also maintained personal as well as political connections. In 1614 he was returned to the Addled Parliament by Bishop's Castle, Shropshire. He became a justice of the peace in Shropshire and was appointed second judge for the northern circuit of the court of great sessions in 1622. Made a member of the council in the marches in 1623, he also served as recorder of Bridgnorth from 1624 until 1640. After the death of his first wife, Anne, the daughter of John Lyttelton of Frankley, Worcestershire, he married (before 1625) Sidney, the daughter of the judge Sir William Jones of Castellmarch, and the widow of both Richard Wynn of Glasinfryn, and Sir George Calverley, of Ley, Cheshire. Returned to parliament for both Leominster and Caernarfon borough in 1625, he vacated the Welsh seat in favour of his brother-in-law, Robert Jones. He was elected again for the same places to the next two parliaments and sat in 1626 for Leominster and in 1628 for Caernarfon. Though he was apparently sometimes absent from the house while away on circuit, Littleton gradually made an increasingly significant impact. He sat on a few committees in 1625, but was quite active both as a speaker and committee man in 1626. A participant in the attack on the king's favourite, the duke of Buckingham, Littleton none the less advised that while common fame constituted sufficient grounds on which to accuse the duke, it was not sufficient evidence on which to condemn him. He was also involved in drafting a remonstrance for presentation to the king in which the house responded to the arrest of Elliot and Digges by asserting its claim to freedom of speech in discussing all business that concerned the commonwealth.<br>
<br>Littleton emerged as a leading figure in the parliament of 1628 which condemned the forced loan and pushed forward the petition of right in the wake of the arrest by the council, and detention without bail, of the five knights who had refused to pay the loan. He spoke frequently and was appointed to forty-six committees. The chairman of that on liberty and property, he guided the inquiry into the use of martial law and the detested practice of billeting soldiers on the country. Making a report from the committee on 3 April he stressed that it was &#145;an ancient and undoubted right of every free man that he hath a full and absolute propriety in his goods and estate&#146;  (Johnson, 2.278). Presenting the Commons' case against arbitrary arrest to the Lords less than a week later, he used <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and other statutes to demonstrate how &#145;due process of law&#146;, including the right to bail and trial by peers, was &#145;lex terrae&#146;, the law of the land, and that it applied to those arrested by the crown and council in just the same way as it did in ordinary cases  (ibid., 2.334ff.). When the goods of John Rolle, a member of the house, were seized for his refusal to pay tonnage and poundage Littleton moved, on 22 January 1629, that those responsible for the breach of parliamentary privilege should be sent for. Later on in the same session he stated that no canon made by the convocation of the church could have any authority unless it had the approval of the state, expressed in parliament.<br>
<br>Acting as counsel for Selden in the case of the MPs arrested on the king's orders for causing a disturbance at the end of the 1629 session, Littleton referred several times to the petition of right in arguing that they should be granted bail. Early in 1631 he acted for defendants who had refused to compound for the recently introduced knighthood fines, although he appears to have accepted that the king had the substantive right to impose the measure. Like several other leading lawyers of the 1620s who had been critical of royal policy he was in any case advanced as a servant of the crown in the course of the 1630s. On the recommendation of King Charles the City of London made him its recorder on 7 December 1631, and in the same year he was appointed counsel to the University of Oxford. Nominated autumn reader at the Inner Temple in 1632 he lectured on the statute 27 Ed. III c. 17 (Merchant Strangers), a topic that gave him the opportunity to quote the works of the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius and reflect on a subject of some importance at the time, the sovereignty of the seas. The diarist Sir Richard Hutton thought that Littleton was the first choice of William Noy to succeed him in the post of attorney-general, but when Noy died in 1634 John Bankes was promoted instead. Littleton replaced Bankes as solicitor-general on 17 October 1634, and he was knighted in October 1635. Although he was a member of the court of high commission from 1633 and a commissioner for searching out defective titles to land, Littleton's role in the formulation and execution of Caroline financial measures is unclear, but in 1637, when the legality of ship money was tested in court, he spoke for three days in response to the case made for John Hampden against the king. Invoking the words of Sir Edward Coke, who had said that court records were a much better guide to legal history than chronicles, Littleton elaborated his case with a &#145;beadroll of examples and precedents&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.926) from before the conquest to the time of the forced loan, but since Hampden's lawyers had not yet questioned the claim that the levy was made in response to an emergency his principal point was also based on the law of nature and reason. The defence of the realm was more important than the law of property; indeed, individual property could not be safe if the commonwealth was in danger.<blockquote>Salus populi suprema lex &hellip; And truly it is a strange imposture, that the law should so provide, that the king by his writ can give us a remedy for white-acre and black-acre, for a clod of earth, and not be able to give a writ to defend the kingdom when it is in imminent danger. (ibid.)</blockquote>Between 1634 and 1638 Littleton served as treasurer of the Inner Temple. Having been made a serjeant-at-law just a few days earlier, on 27 January 1640 he became chief justice of the court of common pleas. This was the most lucrative position in the legal system, and the one which Littleton had always described as his highest ambition, but his tenure was short, and he was soon enveloped in the growing political storms of the next couple of years. Having been appointed a privy councillor on the advice of Archbishop William Laud and the earl of Strafford, on 18 January 1641 he was removed from common pleas and made lord keeper of the great seal after the previous holder, Sir John Finch, had fled into exile. A month later he was created Baron Littleton of Mounslow, with the probable intention that he should use his position in the House of Lords to help deflect the growing attack on the earl of Strafford. At this point, however, Littleton suffered a serious illness that incapacitated him until after Strafford's trial, and which, according to Clarendon, took a permanent toll on his &#145;natural vigour and vivacity&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.&sect;203).<br>
<br>On 18 May 1641 Littleton was placed at the head of a commission to execute the office of lord high treasurer. When, on 16 August, the parliamentary commissioners were about to proceed to Edinburgh to treat with the Scottish parliament Littleton refused to pass their commission under the great seal in the absence of directions from the king, but thereafter his actions began to lead King Charles seriously to question his loyalty. He firmly refused to put the great seal to the proclamation for the arrest of the five members in January 1642, and some reports suggest that he asked to be allowed to resign his position. In April and May he lent his weight to the view that it was legal for the houses to commission lord lieutenants, and he also spoke for, and voted in favour of, the militia ordinance, perhaps hoping that the measures would help stop the king from declaring war. In a private conversation reported by Clarendon, Littleton claimed that he feigned complicity with the houses because he feared that they would otherwise take the great seal into their own custody, but the king, now in York, remained dissatisfied. Charles sent a messenger to collect the seal, and after handing it over Littleton took advantage of a weekend break in the parliamentary proceedings to depart from London on 23 May. Soon afterwards he informed the Lords that the king had ordered him not to leave his presence; after giving him warning a year later that he would lose his place if he did not return the seal, the two houses passed an ordinance for creating a new one on 10 November 1643.<br>
<br>Evidently depressed at what he saw as the inevitability of war, Littleton displayed a &#145;visible dejectedness&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.&sect;203) when he arrived at York which did little to restore Charles's confidence in him; for some time afterwards the great seal was kept in the king's bedchamber. Though he possessed a &#145;grave and comely&#146; presence  (ibid., 3.&sect;81), Littleton's manner and legal learning appear not to have made him a very effective councillor, but he was present when Charles received the parliamentary peace proposals at Oxford in early 1643. In May of the same year he was again appointed a commissioner of the treasury, and on 21 May 1644 he was given a commission as colonel to raise a regiment of foot from among the gentlemen of the inns of court and chancery in London. Along with other royalists he was granted a DCL degree from Oxford University on 31 January 1643, and it was probably when he was with the king in Oxford that he began working on a major jurisprudential treatise, which he seems to have intended for publication and which he entitled, with reference to his distinguished ancestor, &#145;The newe Littleton&#146;. Although only parts of the manuscript survive (now at Harvard law school, MS 2106), it demonstrates his vast learning not only in English legal sources, but also in a very wide selection of continental works ranging from the <span class="italic">Corpus juris civilis</span> to Italian and especially French treatises of the sixteenth century. Organized on an alphabetical basis the treatise was intended to be an encyclopaedic comparative work that would cover international and ecclesiastical as well as private and constitutional law.<br>
<br>Littleton died at Oxford on 27 August 1645 and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, where his daughter erected a monument to his memory. When parliament ordered in the following September that his books and manuscripts in London should be seized they were put into the hands of Bulstrode Whitelocke, but were evidently disbursed thereafter. A volume of law reports published under Littleton's name in 1683 may have been owned by him, but he is unlikely to have been the author.<br>
