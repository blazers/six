<span class="headword">Cousin,  Jean</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1574), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born in Flanders, possibly at Lille. He was a student at Lausanne between 1545 and 1546 and a &#145;pensionnaire de MM de Berne&#146;  (Kennedy, 330), although he was also in Geneva for some of that time. Known as Cognatus (the Latinate form of his name), he, like Nicolas des Gallars, formed one of a small group of students and trainee ministers who transcribed Calvin's sermons. In November 1545 Cousin recorded two sermons arising from the early stages of what became the Schmalkaldic War between the emperor Charles V and German protestants; they were published the following year. Cousin was a schoolmaster in Geneva in 1547, but went on to be a deacon at Moudon and from 1551 a pastor at Payerne in the Pays de Vaud. He became secretary to Pierre Viret in Lausanne and was handling correspondence relating to the local &#145;classe&#146; of ministers in June 1554. He became an <i>habitant</i> of Geneva in 1559.<br>
<br>Cousin was sent by the Genevan company of pastors to serve the Reformed church at Caen at the end of May 1559. One of the town's three ministers, he was also active in the surrounding area. He organized a church for N. de Hetteville, baron de la Fert&eacute;-Fresnel, and wrote to Calvin, late in October 1561, attesting to the noble's importance and supporting his request for a minister. In Caen, Cousin was actively involved in Calvinist attempts to achieve freedom of worship on the eve of the religious wars. Following the iconoclastic riots in Rouen in April 1562, the Reformed ministers in Caen were summoned to the city's council chamber. Cousin took the opportunity to denounce idolatry and called for it to be overthrown, precipitating a wave of iconoclastic rioting in the city. Later in that year he was involved in suborning a soldier in a Calvinist attempt to seize the castle.<br>
<br>By autumn 1562 Cousin was resident in London, and in 1563 succeeded Nicolas des Gallars as minister of the French church there, signing a testimonial to his predecessor on 14 May. As a fellow prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Calvin, Cousin continued the French church's development into an orthodox Calvinist community, although his strict Genevan approach to religious discipline brought him into conflict with some members of the community. Several issues relating to the organization of the church had not been fully resolved by des Gallars, such as the election and tenure of elders, but under Cousin communal elections were abandoned. He was also drawn into the affairs of the other exile churches. Together with Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, and several English ministers, he was a mediator in the dispute over the Dutch church's rejection of godparents at baptism. He was one of the commissioners who examined the charges of sodomy made against the Spanish minister Casiodoro de Reina in September 1563. Cousin doubted Reina's religious orthodoxy, especially on the Trinity, after reading his correspondence with Antonio del Corro in March 1564. His concern to ensure doctrinal orthodoxy continued when Corro began preaching in London in early 1567. Although Corro appealed to Theodore Beza, and the Genevan reformer corresponded with Cousin on the matter, it was referred to Grindal in 1569 for resolution.<br>
<br>Cousin had been promised an assistant on his appointment; he told the consistory in November 1564 that he would henceforth only give one sermon on feast days because &#145;he has now served alone for almost two years, and we have thought nothing of it, and he is tired of serving alone&#146;  (Johnston, 90). Attempts were made to find him an assistant, which became even more urgent after Cousin fell ill in February 1565. Although these attempts were unsuccessful, the deterioration in the religious climate on the continent during the later 1560s and early 1570s led a number of ministers to seek refuge in London, several of whom assisted in the French church. The rapid growth in the alien population, particularly in the wake of the St Bartholomew's day massacre (1572), created serious difficulties for the church. From September 1572 two services had to be held on Sunday mornings, as the building was not big enough to accommodate the whole congregation. The influx also placed a strain on the community's financial resources, while friction and disputes arose with the local community. Cousin intervened directly with the authorities in certain cases, for instance that of a student called Claude who attempted to defraud the earl of Leicester when he was paid by him to deliver a letter to Beza. The French church was also actively involved in establishing new communities, as at Southampton in 1567, in order to allay concerns about the size of the alien population in the capital.<br>
<br>In 1571 Cousin was elected to represent the London French church at the Synod of Emden, but the government refused permission for the English exile churches to be represented. None the less the church remained part of the Calvinist network: Cousin corresponded with Beza and des Gallars, as well as with other French Reformed churches, including that at Frankfurt concerning Reina. The French church also continued to provide an important link between the continental reformers and the English court, as it had under des Gallars. Cousin's correspondence shows that he was on intimate terms with English ecclesiastics such as Thomas Cartwright, Thomas Sampson, Bernard Gilpin, and William Whittingham, as well as politicians like Sir Henry Killigrew, Sir Walter Mildmay, and Sir Francis Walsingham.<br>
<br>Cousin and his wife, Breugen (her surname is unknown), were living in the precincts of Blackfriars, London, &#145;with iij boyes and ij wenches that goeth to school&#146; in 1568  (Kirk and Kirk, 3.408). The household suffered from plague in 1569, which may have killed Cousin's children; they are mentioned neither in the 1571 return of aliens nor in Cousin's will. The minister died in August 1574, between the 4th, when he made his will, and the 20th, when it was proved. He was survived by his wife, to whom he left all his goods &#145;comprising my books and meagre furniture&#146;  (Kennedy, 343). She was still alive in 1576.<br>
