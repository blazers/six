<span class="headword">Seton, Sir  Alexander, of Pitmedden</span>, first baronet, Lord Pitmedden  (1639?&#150;1719), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the younger son of Sir John Seton of Pitmedden, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1639), and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Samuel Johnston of Elphinstone. Following his father's death commanding a royalist detachment at the battle of the Bridge of Dee on 18 June 1639, Alexander and his older brother, James, were raised as wards of their father's kinsman the entrepreneurial George Seton, third earl of Winton. In 1650 Seton matriculated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and graduated in 1654. On 10 December 1661 he was admitted as an advocate of the Scottish bar and was knighted by Charles II in 1664. When his brother died serving the Royal Navy in 1667, Seton inherited the estate of Pitmedden, where in 1675 he began designing the formal terraced garden, later known as the &#145;Great Garden of Pitmedden&#146;.<br>
<br>Following the demise of Sir Richard Maitland of Pittrichie, Seton was nominated an ordinary lord of the court of session on 31 October 1677 and took his seat as Lord Pitmedden on 13 November of that year. On the promotion of Lord President Falconer, he was subsequently admitted a lord of justiciary on 5 July 1682 and created baronet of Nova Scotia on 15 January 1684. Regarded as &#145;the touns deir frind Pitmedden&#146;, Seton represented the county of Aberdeen in the parliaments of 1681, 1685, and 1686  (Taylor, 4.320). Resolutely opposed to the attempts of James VII and II to secure the repeal of the test and penal laws, Pitmedden was, however, the only one of nine judges sitting in parliament who openly opposed the royal will. His consequent removal from office, by a royal letter dated 12 May 1686, and the dismissal of several other recalcitrant state officers were collectively judged to be &#145;warning shots &hellip; to terrify and divert other Members of Parliament from their opposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Notices</span>, 2.723). Having retired into private life thereafter, he declined reappointment as a judge after the revolution, deeming it inconsistent with the oath of allegiance he had previously sworn to James. A Latin panegyric of his life was composed by William Black in 1690.<br>
<br>As an appendix to the second edition of Sir George Mackenzie's <span class="italic">Laws and Customs of Scotland in Matters Criminal</span>, in 1699 Seton published &#145;A treatise of mutilation and demembration&#146;, examining how punishment for these crimes had evolved from strict adherence to the <i>lex talionis</i> to the imposition of arbitrary pecuniary damages. He was also the author of the posthumously published &#145;Explication of the XXXIX chapter of the statutes of King William&#146;, which defended the legal right of minors to be exempt from actions against their property. In or before 1673 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1723), daughter of William Lauder, one of the clerks of session. They had five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25127/', "Sir William Seton")</script>, and five daughters. Following Seton's death in 1719, his extensive library of over 3000 titles was sold by auction in 1720.<br>
