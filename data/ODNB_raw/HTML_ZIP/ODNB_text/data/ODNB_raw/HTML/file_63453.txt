<span class="headword">Fraser,  Alexander Garden</span>  (1873&#150;1962), <span class="occ">educationist and missionary</span>, was born on 6 October 1873 at Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33248/', "Sir Andrew Henderson Leith Fraser KCSI (1848&#150;1919)")</script>, of the Indian Civil Service, and his first wife, Agnes Archibald (<i>d</i>. 1879) of Tillicoultry; his grandfather the Revd A. G. Fraser was a Presbyterian missionary in India for sixty years and his father while in the Indian Civil Service also served as moderator of the Presbyterian church assembly in India. Fraser was educated at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh and at Edinburgh University and Trinity College, Oxford. At Oxford in 1892, with his friends J. H. Oldham, W. E. S. Holland, and Temple Gairdner, he pledged himself to become a missionary under the influence of the visiting evangelists J. R. Mott and R. E. Speer who were campaigning for &#145;The evangelization of the world in this generation&#146;  (E. A. Livingstone, <span class="italic">The Evangelization of the World in this Generation</span>, 1900). On graduating he worked with the Student Volunteer Missionary Union in which he fell in love with a Cambridge student, Beatrice Glass (1873&#150;1970), who was committed to work with the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in Uganda. The Presbyterian Fraser impetuously became an Anglican, joined the CMS and followed his fianc&eacute;e in 1900 to Uganda where they were married in the following year. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In Uganda characteristics of Fraser's later educational policies emerged. He encouraged his pupils to undertake manual labour by leading them through the swamplands, carrying mud on his head, to the building site of the new cathedral. He persuaded the CMS, despite the reluctance of some colleagues, to establish Kings School, Budo, as an &eacute;lite secondary boarding-school for sons of chiefs and future ordinands with a resident European staff. Before he could take charge of this project he had to return to Britain in 1903 on the breakdown of his wife's health and to a lesser extent of his own. He next took a course in theology at New College, Edinburgh. One of the few overseas posts of the CMS to which the doctors would now allow his wife to accompany him was in the highlands of Ceylon. In 1904 Fraser was appointed principal of the society's Trinity College, Kandy, and held the position until 1924.<br>
<br>At the time of Fraser's arrival the college was suffering from severe absenteeism and breakdown of discipline. There had been six principals in four years. Fraser revived the college by raising money to enable personally handpicked graduates from Oxford and Cambridge to be recruited to the staff. Prefects were appointed, staff became resident, and a community spirit was fostered through social service schemes in which staff and students together built shelters for rickshaw pullers, visited hospitals, and made a social survey of the Kandy slums which shamed the authorities into action. More controversially Fraser introduced study of the vernacular languages at the expense of Latin, Greek, and French. He was eventually ordained as a priest in the Church of England at the age of forty-two but was rebuked by the Anglican bishop for allowing ministers of other denominations to preach at the school. His modernization of the curriculum, his ecumenical practices, his love of horseplay, and his expressed sympathy for the aspirations of Ceylonese nationalists scandalized many other missionaries, sixty of whom petitioned the CMS for his recall. Though a candidate, he failed to be appointed bishop of Colombo.<br>
<br>His tenure was interrupted by service with the YMCA and as an army chaplain in France during the First World War. After returning to Trinity he served as chairman of a commission on village education which visited India in 1919. During this investigation he was highly critical of European missionaries for having failed to protest against the massacre of Amritsar.<br>
<br>In 1924, at the suggestion of his brother-in-law J. H. Oldham, Fraser was appointed the first principal of the government secondary school at Achimota in the Gold Coast. This was the favourite project of the colony's governor, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, who saw it as the key to the training of local people who would eventually take over all government posts from expatriates. Before setting out Fraser preached a sermon in Westminster Abbey attacking the Kenya government so fiercely for its oppression of African labour that the Kenya legislature adjourned in protest against such misuse of the abbey's pulpit. While this incident could have jeopardized his appointment, it was probably a calculated indiscretion to demonstrate that, although he would be a government official as principal of Achimota, his sympathies were with African aspirations.<br>
<br>Fraser took with him on his staff the well-known African-American educationist J. E. K. Aggrey who did much to win the support of African nationalists. This support was continued after Aggrey's death when Fraser persuaded the government to make Achimota an independent institution with a governing body of which Africans were members. As at Trinity, he brought in talented Oxford and Cambridge graduates and on their arrival made them study local languages and culture. Here too he introduced the practice of voluntary social service in the community. The college became co-educational and its activities included not only arts and science but also agriculture and engineering; it came to provide a full ladder from infant education to external university degrees. When later Gold Coast became the first British colony in Africa to achieve independence, many of its ministers and senior civil servants were Achimotans. Fraser, however, alienated his most important ally, Guggisberg, by getting hold of a government file in a department which had nothing to do with Achimota and writing a pungent minute in it. In 1926 and 1927 he visited Nigeria to report to the government on the state of education there. His report was so critical and trenchantly phrased that it was not published. With Guggisberg he wrote <span class="italic">The Future of the Negro Race</span>, published in London in 1929.<br>
<br>Fraser left Achimota in 1935. He spent an uncomfortable period as warden of a new adult education centre, Newbattle Abbey, in Dalkeith, Scotland, from 1937 to 1940, as his powers were restricted by his governing body. Intermittently between 1940 and 1948 he served as assistant chaplain of Gordonstoun School, warmly sympathizing with the ideas of its founder, Kurt Hahn. From 1941 to 1943 he was principal of an American Quaker teacher training college, Highgate, in Jamaica. Here again, though he won the affection of his students and staff, he had an uneasy relationship with his governing body. Returning to England, he served in 1944&#150;6 as curate at Goring by Sea, where his son-in-law was the incumbent. His final enthusiasm was for the Moral Re-Armament movement in whose house in Berkeley Square, London, he spent his last years.<br>
<br>Fraser was widely recognized as the greatest colonial headmaster of his time. He was deeply religious, though to the dismay of some of his fellow missionaries he saw his duty not as to proselytise but rather to help to bring in the kingdom of God by whatever means. Christianity he saw as linked to national independence, and high-quality educational institutions as a prelude to decolonization. He was a resolute and successful opponent of the colour bar. His charisma inspired devotion and admiration from staff and pupils but his impulsiveness and fiery temper limited his wider influence. He was openly contemptuous of officialdom and used to quote Kierkegaard to the effect that there is nothing so repellent to God as an official because God is personal and the official is a negation of personality, though in 1930 he accepted the appointment as CBE. In a sermon in Oxford in 1940 Fraser compared the British treatment of Africans in the Rhodes era with that of the Poles and Jews by Hitler. Yet in retirement he was surprised by and resented his exclusion from committees which advised the colonial secretary on educational policies.<br>
<br>Fraser was a handsome man and at his most charming when silently expressing his regret for his impulsive and wounding utterances, though he hated to apologize in words. A colleague, Lord Hemingford, described him as an imperious democrat, a romantic realist, a hard hitting mystic, and irrepressibly naughty  (BBC interview 1962). Fraser died aged eighty-nine in Trinity House Nursing Home, 26 Church Road, St Leonards, Sussex, on 27 January 1962.<br>
