<span class="headword">Martin,  Mary Letitia</span>  (1815&#150;1850), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 28 August 1815 at Ballinahinch Castle, co. Galway, the only child of Thomas Barnewall Martin (1786&#150;1847), MP for the county, and his wife, Julia Kirwan. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18207/', "Richard Martin (1754&#150;1834)")</script>, the well-known philanthropist and founder of the RSPCA, nicknamed &#145;Humanity Martin&#146;, was her grandfather. Mary Martin followed the family philanthropical tradition, devoting herself to improving the condition of her father's tenantry and earning the popular title of the Princess of Connemara. During the great famine, when the tenants were unable to pay rent, the Martins spent large sums on food and clothing for them, and gave continuous work to several hundred labourers.<br>
<br>For Mary Martin's sake her father ill-advisedly broke the entail, mortgaged his large estates to the extent of &pound;200,000 to the Law Life Assurance Society, and further burdened himself with the debts of his father and grandfather, liabilities dating as far back as 1775. When he died on 23 April 1847 the heavily charged estates passed to Mary. On 14 September 1847 she married her cousin, Arthur Gonne Bell of Brookside, co. Mayo, who assumed by royal licence the surname and arms of Martin. Around the time of her marriage she borrowed further large sums of money, with which to relieve her tenantry, both from private sources and from the Law Life Assurance Company; when she was unable to pay the instalments of her father's mortgages, the society insisted on the observance of the bond. The property was among the first brought into the encumbered estates court. Out of an estate of nearly 200,000 acres not a single rood remained to Mary Martin. She retired to Fontaine L'Ev&ecirc;que in Belgium, and attempted to support herself by her writing, publishing <span class="italic">Julia Howard, a Romance</span> (1850), which is believed to contain much autobiographical material as well as information on the workings of the penal laws. It is set in the 1740s in the west of Ireland, where Julia Howard, the niece of a member of parliament, buys up an estate and engages in philanthropy. The hero, through no fault of his own, loses his estates, and becomes a soldier of fortune. Mary Martin also published <span class="italic">St Etienne: a Tale of the Vendeam War</span> (1845) set in Napoleonic times, and contributed to the <span class="italic">Encyclop&eacute;die des Gens du Monde</span> and other French periodicals. While emigrating to America she was prematurely confined on board ship, and died on 7 November 1850, only ten days after reaching New York. Her husband survived until 1883.<br>
