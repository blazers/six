<span class="headword">Thwaites,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1671, <em>d.</em> 1711), <span class="occ">Anglo-Saxon and Greek scholar</span>, was born at Crosby Ravensworth, Westmorland, and baptized there on 15 November 1671, the son of William Thwaites, a resident there. He attended a school in Kendal, before being admitted a batteler at Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 22 October 1689, aged eighteen; he graduated BA in 1694 and MA in 1697. At Queen's he quickly came under the influence of the enthusiasm for Anglo-Saxon studies promoted by George Hickes, who came to live at Gloucester Green, in Oxford, in 1696 and encouraged Thwaites to undertake the publication of texts in Old English. Hickes suggested that he prepare an edition of the Alfredian Orosius (a project in fact undertaken by William Elstob), while Humfrey Wanley had earlier proposed for him an edition of parts of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Old English, which Thwaites realized with his edition of the <span class="roman">Heptateuch</span> in 1698.<br>
<br>In the same year, 1698, that he was ordained priest (2 January) Thwaites was admitted fellow of Queen's (31 October) and designated Anglo-Saxon preceptor. His letters to Hickes and Wanley during the years 1697&#150;1703 reveal how quickly he learned Old English, how busy he was with his own work and his teaching, and how, with his efficient and brisk approach, he acted as project manager for a major co-operative enterprise in Anglo-Saxon studies that was to eventuate in 1703&#150;5, under Hickes's name, as the <span class="italic">Thesaurus linguarum septentrionalium</span>. It was Thwaites&#151;as one learns from his businesslike and sometimes brusque letters urging Wanley to hurry up with his copy, and his sending material to Hickes as the latter moved between safe houses&#151;who kept the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> on track and ensured its publication. He also took his teaching duties very seriously, recognizing that the necessary textbooks, dictionaries, and grammars of Old English were lacking or unsuitable for beginners, and setting out, with the help of others, to supply that want himself. In 1699 he was appointed dean of Queen's, and attempted to improve college discipline. By all accounts he was a good-humoured, energetic man and rather handsome. Elizabeth Elstob represented him as St Gregory within the initial G that begins the Old English text of her <span class="italic">English-Saxon Homily on the Birthday of St. Gregory</span> (1709, p. 1) with her own portrait in the initial of the first word of the adjacent column.<br>
<br>In addition to his work on the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> and his dedicated and inspirational teaching of Old English, Thwaites's most important contribution to Anglo-Saxon studies was his 1698 edition of hitherto unedited parts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in Old English, including <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, <span class="roman">Exodus</span>, <span class="roman">Leviticus</span>, <span class="roman">Numbers</span>, <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span>, <span class="roman">Joshua</span>, <span class="roman">Judges</span>, and the book of <span class="roman">Job</span>, together with the apocryphal <span class="roman">Judith</span> and the <span class="roman">Gospel of Nicodemus</span>. Several colleagues, among them Hickes, Wanley, Gibson, and Nicolson, showed an active interest in the project during its preparation. Although some of his contemporaries criticized Thwaites's edition&#151;partly because it included apocryphal material, partly for its lack of a Latin translation and notes&#151;it was for its time a ground-breaking enterprise and one that was not repeated until 1922, when S. J. Crawford edited the <span class="roman">Heptateuch</span> afresh, using a different base manuscript. Thwaites's edition had been based on Bodleian MS Laud misc. 509, and his text was reprinted, with some emendations, by C. W. M. Grein in 1872. Thwaites dedicated his edition to George Hickes, at that time still proscribed as a nonjuror, and this caused some political embarrassment to the vice-chancellor, who threatened to suppress the edition unless Thwaites cut out the dedication. He bluntly refused&#151;and prevailed.<br>
<br>Thwaites published two other works in the Old English field, <span class="italic">Notae in Anglo-Saxonum nummos</span> (1708) and <span class="italic">Grammatica-Anglo-Saxonica ex Hickesiano Linguarum septentrionalium thesauro excerpta</span> (1711). The second of these, as its name suggests, was an abridged and simplified version of the Old English grammar in Hickes's <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>, for student use. In addition Thwaites was probably the main contributor to the Anglo-Saxon dictionary printed in 1701 that bears the name of Thomas Benson. This was a revised but abbreviated version of Somner's dictionary, and Thwaites's copy of Somner, with his additions and annotations revealing his wide reading in Old English texts, is extant as Bodleian MS Ballard 51. Two projects that Thwaites began but never finished were an edition of the Old English <span class="italic">Pastoral Care</span> and a gospel harmony.<br>
<br>Besides his work in Old English, Thwaites evidently had considerable expertise in Greek. His first published work was an edition of <span class="italic">Dionysii orbis descriptio</span> (Oxford, 1697). In 1704 he was appointed university lecturer in moral philosophy, in 1707 regius professor of Greek, and in 1708 Whyte's professor of moral philosophy. In 1709 he published another Greek text, the works of St Ephraim the Syrian: <span class="italic">Ephraem Syrus, Graece e codicibus manuscriptis Bodleianis</span>&#151;an edition that has not been superseded. Although some, like Thomas Hearne, had a rather poor opinion of Thwaites's performance in these offices his alleged neglect of them is likely to have been influenced by the worsening state of health that afflicted him from at least 1705 until his death. He suffered from tuberculosis, which first affected his right leg at the knee, causing him such pain that he was moved to have his leg amputated above the knee by Queen Anne's surgeon, Charles Bernard. There are several graphic descriptions by contemporaries of Thwaites's courage and determination during this operation, which he survived. Queen Anne is said to have been so impressed by Bernard's account of Thwaites's behaviour that she granted him &pound;200 and probably influenced his appointment to the chair of Greek. The disease later spread to his lungs and reduced him to &#145;a meer Sceleton&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 3.287). In the last year of his life he retired to Littlemore, near Oxford, where he died on 12 December 1711. He was buried, at about 5 pm on the day of his death, in Iffley church, &#145;where a small black slab upon the altar-floor marks the spot of his interment&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.147) and gives his age at death, erroneously, as forty-four. He died intestate&#151;survived by his mother, his father having predeceased him&#151;and, as Hearne confirms, his college laid claim to his possessions, his books being sold at Oxford in May 1712.<br>
