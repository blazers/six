<span class="headword">Pole,  Richard  de la</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1525), <span class="occ">soldier and claimant to the English throne</span>, sometimes known after 1506 as Blanche Rose, was the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22450/', "John de la Pole (1442&#150;1492)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Plantagenet (1444&#150;1503/4), a sister of Edward IV, and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22449/', "John de la Pole, earl of Lincoln (c.1460&#150;1487)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22446/', "Edmund de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (1472?&#150;1513)")</script>. Nothing is known of his life before 1500, when he was present at Calais when Henry VII met the Archduke Philip there. In the following year, however, he fled abroad with his brother Edmund, and in the parliament of January 1504 he was attainted, along with Edmund and their brother William. In March 1504 he was at Aachen with Edmund, and was left there as security for the payment of the latter's debts in the town. Suffolk was so impoverished by that time that threats were made to return Richard to Henry VII unless the debts were paid. Richard, too, complained of poverty and of the treatment he had received in Edmund's company. He managed to secure the patronage of Erard de la Marck, bishop of Li&egrave;ge, however, and extracted himself from Aachen, and by the autumn of 1506 he was at Buda in Hungary. Henry VII sent ambassadors to King Ladislaus VI to demand his surrender, which was evidently refused, since Richard was given a pension.<br>
<br>In April 1509 Richard, Edmund, and William de la Pole were excepted by name from the general pardon issued at Henry VIII's accession. In December 1510 the emperor Maximilian interceded on Richard's behalf, asking Margaret of Savoy to approach Henry VIII for Richard's pardon, but by June 1512, when France and England were at war, it was known that Richard was being sponsored by Louis XII as a claimant to the English crown, and in December that year he commanded German landsknecht mercenaries during the French invasion of Navarre, where he formed a lasting friendship with the chevalier de Bayard. He led troops against the English again at the siege of Th&eacute;rouanne in 1513.<br>
<br>In May 1513, following the execution of his brother Edmund, Richard de la Pole assumed the title of duke of Suffolk and openly claimed the English crown. He recruited disaffected Englishmen to his service, including Thomas, illegitimate son of Sir William Stanley executed in 1495, and by June 1514 it was rumoured that Louis XII had provided a fleet and soldiers for a landing in Scotland with John Stewart, duke of Albany, so that they could mount a joint invasion of England. Their departure from St Malo in Brittany was abandoned, however, following the conclusion of peace with England on 7 August. As part of the negotiations Henry VIII had insisted on Pole's surrender. Louis refused, but by September Pole was relieved of his command of the landsknechts and moved, with Louis's support, to the protection of the duke of Lorraine at Metz, where he arrived on 2 September. He took up residence in a house lent by Sir Claude Baudioche, where he remained until early 1519. He became a burgess of the town in February 1515, and was also credited with introducing horse-racing there.<br>
<br>Pole's position as a conspirator against Henry VIII was maintained following the accession of Fran&ccedil;ois I as king of France on 1 January 1515. Pole's spies sought support within the garrisons of Calais and Tournai, and by April 1515 unpaid English soldiers of Tournai were threatening to defect to him. He also received information from England via East Anglian merchants trading in Flanders. By the autumn of 1515 Sir Thomas Spinelly, the English ambassador in Flanders, was dispatching spies to infiltrate Pole's circle of followers, and there was also discussion at Westminster of assassination attempts. This espionage was carried on frantically throughout 1516 and 1517, especially after it was reported in December 1516 that Fran&ccedil;ois had promised troops to Pole for another invasion attempt. During 1517 two of Pole's associates, William Ponder and Thomas Stanley, contacted English agents in the hope of negotiating safe conducts and pardons for themselves, and provided valuable information on Pole's condition and the financial support provided by Fran&ccedil;ois. According to Stanley he was receiving a pension of 4000 crowns from Fran&ccedil;ois and was able to provide his servants with a grey and blue livery, though he was also very slow in paying them their wages; Ponder spoke of nocturnal meetings with the French king in Paris. Pole was also reported to be in touch with the king of Denmark, while between June and August 1517 he paid visits to Milan and Venice, and by May 1518 there were rumours that he and Albany were to invade England from Holstein in Denmark. But in the end Pole remained in Lombardy for the rest of that year.<br>
<br>After the death of the emperor Maximilian on 12 January 1519, Fran&ccedil;ois I sent Pole as an envoy to Prague, to try to persuade Lajos of Bohemia and his tutor Sigismund, king of Poland, to consider Fran&ccedil;ois's candidature for the imperial crown. In September that year the discovery of an affair with a married woman in Metz prompted Pole's removal from his lavish house at St Symphorien in the city's suburbs to Toul, where he stayed as a guest of the cardinal of Lorraine for the next three years before the renewal of war between England and France in 1522 revived his usefulness to Fran&ccedil;ois I. At the close of 1522 he was in Paris with Fran&ccedil;ois, and was again commanding landsknechts. Fran&ccedil;ois considered another invasion of England from Holstein, whose duke he urged to assist Pole and Albany, but Brittany became the chosen embarkation point. The capture and interrogation of a number of Pole's servants at that time confirmed attempts to generate support in East Anglia and elsewhere. Throughout February and March the preparations of Pole and Albany were regularly reported to Cardinal Wolsey. Although they departed together, Albany reached Scotland before 27 September 1523 without Pole. His followers within England would not rise until he appeared, nor would more direct French military support be given until Fran&ccedil;ois was more confident of a successful rising. Pole was expected to mount an invasion, but he did not do so, and nothing further is recorded of his movements until the spring of 1524, when a spy in his service was arrested in Picardy. Two of Pole's letters, intercepted in May 1524, thanked Louise of Savoy, the mother of Fran&ccedil;ois I, for her previous assistance and begged for his mercenaries to be paid, while the capture of former soldiers of Henry VIII's guard in Pole's company outside Gu&icirc;nes later that month confirmed that he remained a focus for English rebels. In September that year large-scale French help for Pole's enterprises was again mooted, perhaps in an invasion of Ireland with the complicity of the earl of Desmond, but any prospect of further assistance ended when he took part in Fran&ccedil;ois I's invasion of Italy shortly afterwards. On 24 February 1525 Fran&ccedil;ois was defeated and captured by Charles V's army at Pavia, and Richard de la Pole, prominent in the fighting as the captain of the French landsknechts, was killed. Pole, who had never married, was buried in the church of the monastery of San Agostino in Pavia. The cathedral chapter at Metz ordered an anniversary celebration for his soul, but in England his death caused rejoicing. According to a later and unverifiable report, the emperor's messenger told Henry VIII how &#145;The White Rose is killed in battle &hellip; I saw him dead with the others&#146;, to which Henry responded in joy &#145;All the enemies of England are gone&#146;  (Scarisbrick, 136).<br>
