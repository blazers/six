<span class="headword">Knight,  Joseph</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1753), <span class="occ">slave and litigant</span>, was born in west Africa, where he was captured and sold to a Captain Knight. Captain Knight, by whose surname he was subsequently known, sold him in Jamaica, aged about thirteen, to John Wedderburn, probably in 1766. Wedderburn employed Knight as his personal servant. Wedderburn had fled, with some of his brothers, to Jamaica after the failure of the Jacobite rising of 1745. Their father, Sir John Wedderburn, fifth baronet, of Blackness in Forfarshire, had been executed for treason in 1746 and forfeited. Wedderburn had prospered in Jamaica, and returned to Scotland in 1768, bringing Knight with him. In November 1769 Wedderburn married Margaret Ogilvy, daughter of the Jacobite David Ogilvy, styled sixth earl of Airlie; Wedderburn had fought in Lord Ogilvy's regiment at Culloden. In the same year Wedderburn acquired the house and estate of Ballindean in Perthshire, near Dundee.<br>
<br>A favourite of Wedderburn's, Knight was taught to read and write and instructed in Christianity, being baptized in Scotland by a minister of the kirk. According to Knight, at his baptism Wedderburn promised to free him in seven years' time &#145;if he behaved well&#146;  (NA Scot., CS 235/K/2/2). He further alleged that Wedderburn stated he would not free him in Scotland, because no one would employ him and he would starve, but in Jamaica, along with a house and some ground, where he could live comfortably.<br>
<br>At Ballindean, Knight formed an association with a chambermaid, Anne Thomson, and the couple conceived a child. Wedderburn dismissed Thomson because of her pregnancy, but gave Knight the money necessary to support the expenses of the pregnancy including rent of accommodation in Dundee. The child having died, Wedderburn refused further support, hoping Knight would break off the association. On 9 March 1773, however, David Johnston, minister of North Leith, married the couple in Edinburgh. This precipitated a rupture between Wedderburn and Knight. Knight wanted his wife to be re-engaged by Wedderburn, with a house provided on the estate for the couple; this was refused. Knight had read in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Advertiser</span> of 3 July 1772 of Lord Mansfield's decision in the case of the former slave James Somerset. He understood this as meaning he was now free, claiming, however, that the humanity with which he had hitherto been treated led him to decide to stay with Wedderburn. But Knight now decided to leave Wedderburn and go to Dundee, where his wife lived, to seek paid employment. On discovering this, Wedderburn, on 13 November 1773, sought a warrant from the justices of the peace of Perthshire to have Knight detained as his slave. This was granted, and the justices, all of whom were closely connected through marriage with Wedderburn or each other, met at Ballindean on 15 November to interrogate Knight. All having interests in slavery, they found against Knight. Knight managed to have the issue brought before the sheriff court at Perth, where the sheriff-depute, John Swinton of Swinton, was known to be sympathetic; Swinton found<blockquote>That the State of Slavery is not recognised by the Laws of this Kingdom and is inconsistent with the principles thereof and Found that the Regulations in Jamaica concerning slaves do not extend to this Kingdom and repelled the Defender's Claim to perpetual Service. (NA Scot., CS 235/K/2/2)</blockquote>The next month Wedderburn initiated a challenge to Swinton's decision in the court of session. The litigation lasted until 1778. Each party employed the most distinguished counsel of the day, Henry Dundas, then lord advocate, giving a particularly brilliant speech for Knight before the court. The printed pleadings were learned and far-ranging, those for Knight stressing the iniquities of the slave trade and challenging the traditional legal and economic arguments in favour of slavery.<br>
<br>The twelve opinions of the judges were very varied. Aware that in Somerset's case Lord Mansfield had avoided giving a general view on slavery, all denied that Wedderburn could send Knight back to Jamaica against his will. Three accepted that Wedderburn had the right to Knight's services for life without wages, while Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, claimed that slavery was unchristian and that Knight was &#145;our brother; and he is a man, although not our colour&#146;  (Dalrymple, 2.777). The court accepted Swinton's judgment, although it is not clear that such a strong statement reflected their common opinion.<br>
<br>By this time Knight and his wife had a second child. After the decision they disappear from the historical record, their subsequent lives and dates of death unknown, although in 2003 James Robertson published <span class="italic">Joseph Knight</span>, a convincing and imaginative novel based on his life, in which he supplied a satisfactory literary conclusion to this historical mystery.<br>
