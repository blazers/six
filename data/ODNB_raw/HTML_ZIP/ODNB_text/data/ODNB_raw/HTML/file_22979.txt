<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Egremont</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1578), <span class="occ">rebel and alleged assassin</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22981/', "Henry Radcliffe, second earl of Sussex (c.1507&#150;1557)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22991/', "Radcliffe, Robert")</script>], magnate, among whose titles was Lord Egremont, and his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1579&times;82), daughter of Sir Philip Calthorpe of Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, and his second wife, Jane. He had two sisters, one of whom, Frances (1552&#150;1602), married Sir Thomas Mildmay. His half-brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22993/', "Thomas Radcliffe")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22982/', "Henry Radcliffe")</script>, third and fourth earls of Sussex respectively. His parents were married at some point between 1534 and 1538, but were divorced by private act of parliament on 13 November 1555, after which his mother married Andrew Wise, vice-treasurer of Ireland. The third earl of Sussex was embittered by the divorce and later described Egremont Radcliffe as &#145;a wicked bastarde, taken for my brother&#146;  (Sharp, 75).<br>
<br>Radcliffe was educated in the household of Robert Horne, bishop of Winchester, who told Sussex in 1563 that he had sent him from Bishop's Waltham to &#145;your L[ordship's] Stuarde&#146; to avoid plague but would have him back &#145;untill your L[ordship] shall thinke good otherwise to provide for him&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Titus Bxiii, fol. 95<i>r</i>). Later he lived in York, as did Thomas Jenye, with whom he joined the northern uprising in 1569. His residence in York is unusual, considering his family was based in Norfolk and Somerset, unless he was serving Sussex, who was lord president of the queen's council of the north. He was a notable Catholic and felt alienated from Elizabeth I's protestant and centralizing regime. Jenye claimed to have met Radcliffe near Topcliffe, North Riding of Yorkshire, going north. Radcliffe persuaded him to join the enterprise by producing assurances and a ring that he had received from Charles Neville, sixth earl of Westmorland. Later, Radcliffe specified Westmorland as having been the &#145;onelie cause of his wicked revolte&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 70/133, fol. 101<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Sussex excepted Radcliffe and Jenye from the pardon offered on 19 November, the only two not named in the list of original rebels earlier in the proclamation. It is, however, quite likely that they had joined as early as 15 November&#151;according to Christopher Norton, their arrival between Durham and Darlington &#145;comfortyd the coman sorte&#146; and embarrassed Sussex  (Sharp, 285). The earl wanted to be &#145;revenged&#146; before &#145;the worlde&#146; for &#145;the trayterous doings of an unnatural brother&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 15/15/46). On the collapse of the rising Radcliffe fled into Liddesdale on the Anglo-Scottish border, remaining with Westmorland rather than the ill-fated Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland. A ship was arranged, which English officials plotted to secure by bribing the captain or by interception. Probably Radcliffe postponed his departure, as Sussex was still seeking his extradition from the borderers in August 1570. However, in October Sir Henry Norris found him in Paris. Radcliffe then went to the Spanish Netherlands, where he met Catholic exiles, and Philip II gave him a pension of 30 crowns per month. He became close to Henry Parker, eleventh Baron Morley, stepson of his aunt Elizabeth Calthorpe.<br>
<br>In April 1571 Radcliffe was said to have killed George Breame, an Englishman living in Antwerp, &#145;with a pistolet for that he wold len[d] him no silver&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1569&#150;71</i>, 527). He was subsequently alleged to have gone to Spain in 1572 to get a royal pardon, but seemed in no hurry. In May he was sent with Jenye to represent the English exiles at Madrid. In September he went to Milan, but (according to a hostile source), &#145;having killed there two other &hellip; was compelled to retourne from thence&#146;  (Knox, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 300). In December 1573 he was said to be in prison for debt in Madrid and in May 1574, passing through France <i>en route</i> for Flanders, to be again in prison for debt and (inevitably) for &#145;disorders&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 15/23/58). By August Philip had spent 800 ducats on him.<br>
<br>Radcliffe apparently changed his attitude in Spain from the hard-core dissidence formerly attributed to him. He made overtures, asking for a pardon, to William Cecil, first Baron Burghley, the lord treasurer, from Bruges in August 1574. By February 1575 he claimed to have left &#145;the entertaynement I had of the kinge of Spayne&#146;, referred to &#145;the injuries I have suffred in Spayne for defending accordinge to my duty her magestie's honnore against Stuclye [Sir Thomas Stucley] and othare of greatar credit&#146;, but darkly said that, being &#145;indetted&#146;, he might &#145;be forced to take wher I have bine prayed &hellip; which I wolde be loathe to doe yf I might choose&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 15/24/4). He defended Morley and Westmorland as also opposing Stucley's invasion plans. Personal disputes may have loomed large in his desire to return to England. He described his previous behaviour as &#145;a yonge man's first faulte, for which the gates of reconciliation is not clene to be cutt awaye&#146; and hoped for subsidy, especially if willing to serve in Ireland  (Sharp, 72). He had returned to London by November. Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, warned Burghley that were Radcliffe to &#145;lynger in this realme&#146;, Elizabeth might &#145;be dryven for example's sake to extende that punishment towardes him, that to his former offences is dewe&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 6992, fol. 32<i>r</i>). Radcliffe was sent to the Tower of London&#151;it was reported to Spain that he was about to make false statements against Philip and would claim that the latter planned to retaliate for English provocations. He carved his name in the Beauchamp Tower, and wrote <span class="italic">Politique Discourses Translated out of French</span> (1578), which he dedicated to Walsingham. It was a personal volte-face, advocating acceptance of the social and political order. He might well ask, &#145;who ever sawe so many discontented persons &hellip; so many controllers of princes and their procedinges: and so fewe imbracing obedience?&#146;  (E. Radcliffe, <span class="italic">Politique Discourses</span>, 1578, sig. A3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In May 1578 Radcliffe was &#145;secretly released and exiled&#146;; the Spanish ambassador in London, Bernardino de Mendoza, reported that he was going to serve Don John of Austria in the Spanish Netherlands. &#145;He is a rash and daring man, ready for anything, and his sudden liberation and decision to serve us may well engender suspicion&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1568&#150;79</i>, 584). He claimed to Sir Amias Paulet, the English ambassador in Paris, that Elizabeth would be his preferred source for &#145;his maintenaunce as maye be mete for a gentleman&#146;, failing which he would &#145;seeke his lyving where he maye finde it&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/2/42). Catholic suspicion intensified. Anselmo Dandino, the papal nuncio in France, heard that Radcliffe was going to Italy&#151;with the musician and probable spy Alfonso Ferrabosco&#151;at Elizabeth's behest, although he made a pretence of being angry with the queen. Cardinal William Allen, founder of the English seminary at Rheims, welcomed him there, though he had been warned of Radcliffe's murderous potential. Radcliffe was arrested, with a man called Gray, when he arrived in Flanders. The details are unclear, reflecting confusion over the facts at the time. Radcliffe was suspected of foul play towards Don John, who died shortly after meeting him. It is unlikely that Radcliffe and Gray were charged with Don John's death, though the Catholic exile, Sir Francis Englefield, put forward the argument that Philip should not meet an English envoy because &#145;some intimates of Don John&#146; observed &#145;that his highness was never well after Ratclyf the Englishman gave a letter into his hands&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 28702, fol. 4<i>r</i>). Poison was suspected. The decision to execute Radcliffe and Gray was probably taken by Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma. They were beheaded in the market place of Namur on either 19 or 26 December 1578.<br>
<br>Walsingham heard that Radcliffe blamed him for the supposed plot. Disingenuously dismissing the reliability of confessions obtained by torture, he asked William Davison, the English envoy to the Netherlands, to investigate &#145;so villainous a slaunder&#146;, considering Radcliffe not &#145;so develishe but that at the houre of his deathe he wolde revoke that which before he had untruely uttered&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 83/11/23). Accounts conflicted, but the Spaniards continued to allege Walsingham's complicity. Sir Lewis Lewknor believed that Radcliffe and Gray had been &#145;most faithfully affected both in religion and service to the Spanish king&#146;, yet &#145;though there never was, nor ever coulde bee anie thing proved against them, and they at their deathes protested themselves to be innocent &hellip; yet theyr heads were stricken off&#146;  (Lewknor, sig. A3<i>r</i>). However, an anonymous correspondent of 1581 reminded Walsingham about a dangerous security breach when an informer &#145;sawe good Mr Egmonde Radlyffe goinge up to Hampton Court unto you, and afterward mayde him lose his heade for it&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/6/37). In 1599 Thomas Harrison, among other doubtful alleged services, claimed: &#145;If I had not cunningly escaped I had died with Egrammond Ratclif and his man, from whom I was to receive notice for Mr Secretary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 9.86). It does seem likely that the English government made some use of Radcliffe's proffered services because he was eminently expendable. His picaresque career makes it probable that he died poor and unmarried&#151;&#145;A ballett of the deathe of Ratlyffe w.ch rosse w.th the earle of Northumberland Lorde Pearse whiche he made a lytle spaice before he was handged&#146; (BL, Cotton MS Vespasian A. xxv, fol. 158<i>v</i>) seems to be entirely generic, implying that he was executed in England, and the alleged farewell to his &#145;wedded wiffe&#146; it recounts hardly signifies.<br>
