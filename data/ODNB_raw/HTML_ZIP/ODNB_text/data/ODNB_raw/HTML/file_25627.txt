</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sinclair, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1754&#150;1835), <span class="occ">agricultural improver, politician, and codifier of &#145;useful knowledge&#146;</span>, was born at Thurso Castle, Caithness, on 10 May 1754, the third but only surviving son of George Sinclair (<i>d</i>. 1770) of Ulbster and his wife, Lady Janet Sutherland (1720&#150;1795), sister of the seventeenth earl of Sutherland. Three sisters also survived to adult life. This branch of the Caithness Sinclairs was not in line for the earldom of Caithness, but owned about a quarter of the county, including much of the land that had belonged to the earldom and also much of its feudal superiorities on which voting in county parliamentary elections was based.<br>
<br>Sinclair was educated at the Edinburgh high school, the universities of Edinburgh (1765&#150;7 and 1768&#150;9) and Glasgow (1767&#150;8), and also as a gentleman-commoner at Trinity College, Oxford (1775&#150;6). He became a member of Lincoln's Inn in 1774, a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1775, and was called to the English bar in 1782, but he never practised either Scots or English law.<br>
<br>On 31 August 1770, aged sixteen, he had inherited on his father's death estates in Caithness yielding approximately &pound;3000 a year, and the superiority of Wick and of much of the county. On 26 March 1776 he married Sarah Maitland (<i>d</i>. 1785), the daughter of a London merchant, Alexander Maitland, who brought him a dowry of &pound;9000. The marriage produced two daughters.<h2>
<a name="Politics17801786"></a>Politics, 1780&#150;1786</h2>Sinclair entered parliament for Caithness at the general election of 1780. Caithness had a parliamentary seat only in alternate elections, a handicap to the prospect of a political career. Sinclair's politics alternated between supporting and advising governments and, when his advice was consistently ignored, moving to independency and trying to organize other independents into a party. He had an exaggerated sense of his own political importance, but since no government could survive without the support of a considerable number of independents, an organizer of such members could affect the outcome of important divisions.<br>
<br>Sinclair started his political career as a supporter of Lord North's ministry, and brashly offered to second the address at the opening of parliament, an offer tactfully declined. In 1782 he began what was to become a vast list of publications with a book, <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Naval Strength of the British Empire</span>, and also <span class="italic">Lucubrations during a Short Recess</span>, the latter a theoretical support of the idea of parliamentary reform which did not confront the electoral system by which he had entered parliament. He followed these with a disorganized collection of Scottish verbal usages, <span class="italic">Observations on the Scottish Dialect</span> (1783), the result of studying to speak the English of the English. Altogether Sinclair was to publish massive volumes on agriculture, political economy, and health, as well as over 350 pamphlets and reprints from newspaper articles: the quality of these productions is very varied.<br>
<br>By the winter of 1782&#150;3 Sinclair was moving to independence and trying to organize other independent MPs in a loose association nicknamed the St Alban's Club because they frequented the St Alban's tavern. In the various divisions which eventually brought down the ministry these men voted in every possible different way, so to call these twenty-three members a club is to overstate their degree of agreement. Under the coalition of Charles Fox and Lord North, which replaced the North ministry, he was able to persuade the government to intervene and dispatch resources valued at &pound;15,000 to the north of Scotland to prevent famine following the failed harvest of 1782. Although he voted for the ministry's <span class="roman">East India Bill</span>, he became an enthusiastic supporter of the younger Pitt when he became chief minister in 1784, and was involved in Pitt's approaches to past members of the St Alban's Club. He sent a list of forty names to Pitt with advice about negotiating for their support.<br>
<br>When Pitt dissolved parliament in 1784 Sinclair had to find a seat, since Caithness did not have one. His attempt to use his dominance of Wick to gain the Tain burghs was defeated by Fox. He was allowed by the ministry to purchase a seat in Lostwithiel, one of Lord Edgecumbe's Cornish pocket boroughs, for &pound;3000. Once in parliament he sent the government various letters of unasked-for advice, and on 14 February 1786 was rewarded with a baronetcy with special remainder to his daughters.<br>
<br>Though he was useful to Pitt at various times, and a nuisance at others, Sinclair never became an intimate. Pitt's style of life was aristocratic and expensive, while Sinclair lived as a family man of middling-rank expenditure, using much of his own resources for public ends. Because of his political career he had to have a house in London, but he soon established a family home in Edinburgh and spent half the year there. His mother lived in his home until her death in 1795.<br>
<br>Sinclair became increasingly interested in political economy and the financing of government. In 1784 he produced his <span class="italic">History of the Public Revenue of Great Britain</span> (2 vols; a further part was added in 1789). This is a useful analysis, once it abandons the medieval period, not only showing financial development but indicating Sinclair's appreciation of the possibilities of government promotion of economic growth. It was unfortunate for Sinclair's political career that he and Pitt had very different ideas of the proper role of government.<h2>
<a name="Foreigntoursecondmarriageandpolitics"></a>Foreign tour, second marriage, and politics</h2>Sinclair's wife died on 15 May 1785, leaving him devastated. He withdrew from politics and considered leaving parliament: he offered to vacate his seat if Pitt needed its vote. To distract himself from loneliness he went abroad, first on a short visit to France, later on a carefully worked out assiduous tour of seven months over northern Europe, timed to fit mostly within the parliamentary recess. Given by Pitt the inexplicit title of commercial negotiator to the northern courts, he went through Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Poland, Prussia, Austria, Hanover, the Netherlands, Flanders, and France, meeting the leading political figures and making links that he was to use later with the network of scientific contacts built up by Sir Joseph Banks.<br>
<br>The tour developed Sinclair's enthusiasm for &#145;useful knowledge&#146; in a wide range of topics. He published papers on the political systems of Denmark, Sweden, and Russia. He was interested in the financial organization of the governments of Russia and Prussia. His permanent interest in the development of agriculture and fisheries dates from this journey, and the journey provided him with a network of correspondents with similar interests. In the long run his new concern for economic development was to widen the gulf between his conception of the function of government and that of Pitt.<br>
<br>Sinclair distanced himself from Pitt over the latter's support for the impeachment of Warren Hastings, with whom he subsequently became friendly, but this was not regarded as a serious deviation by the minister. It was the regency crisis of 1788 that produced the breach. Sinclair again attempted to organize a group of independents, which called itself &#145;armed neutrality&#146;. It included Lord Moira, Bishop Watson of Llandaff, and Henry Adam.<br>
<br>On 6 March 1788 Sinclair married Lady Diana MacDonald (1769&#150;1845), daughter of Lord MacDonald of Sleat and possessor of a dowry of &pound;4000. Her family were government supporters, but the restitution of family life for Sinclair weakened his political significance, since it removed him to Edinburgh for half the year. Lady Diana provided him with seven sons and a further six daughters, almost all of whom survived him. Their third son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25629/', "John Sinclair (1797&#150;1875)")</script>, author, among other works, of a biography of his father.<br>
<br>The response of the ministry to Sinclair's desertion over the regency issue was an attempt by Henry Dundas to unseat him for Caithness in the general election of 1789 and add that county to the long list of seats controlled by Dundas. For once Dundas failed, and Sinclair continued certain of a seat at every other election. His good relations with Dundas were quickly re-established, and in 1792 Sinclair promised Dundas the vote of Wick in the Tain burghs election. The men were natural allies: both saw ways in which government action could benefit Scotland, and were ready to end the legislative inertia which had hung over the country since the Union.<h2>
<a name="TheStatisticalAccountofScotland"></a>The Statistical Account of Scotland</h2>The 1790s were Sinclair's happiest and most creative years. In 1790, as an elder in the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, he launched the idea of a survey of the state of the country, which was to become the twenty-one volumes of the <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span>. It is a detailed account of the geography, history, economy, and society of every parish. He had gathered the word &#145;statistical&#146; from Germany on his northern tour. He used it to mean information which was desirable for legislative purposes, though not necessarily numerical in form. &#145;Statistics&#146;, he said, &#145;should reveal the quantum of happiness in a population&#146;, as well as &#145;the means of further improvement&#146;. He saw the proper function of government as intervention or legislative action to promote welfare and economic growth, and recognized that detailed information was necessary for such intervention to be effective. He was not the first to move towards the collecting of detailed local information. In particular, for Scotland Sir Robert Sibbald had made various county reports; Sir James Steuart had recommended such action. Alexander Webster's Scottish census of 1755 was an interpretation of the same idea, as were Macfarlane's <span class="roman">Geographical Collections</span> of the early eighteenth century. There were the various parish studies made by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and published in 1782. The survey idea was taken further in the census of 1801. The important features of Sinclair's survey were its comprehensive range of topics and the fact that it was fully carried through. All 936 parishes were reported on in the following nine years, and the book as a whole is the most frequently quoted of all Scottish historical sources. There have been two subsequent &#145;statistical accounts&#146; of Scotland, compiled in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; they follow the original one and are useful bodies of local information, but they lack the variety and buoyancy of tone of Sinclair's.<br>
<br>Sinclair sent out a basic questionnaire of 160 items in May 1790: he followed this up with a further six queries almost at once, and another five in June 1791, these last covering education which he had, surprisingly, ignored in 1790. Altogether the questions covered geography, history, wages, prices, population, industry, agriculture, fisheries, farm size, the progress of enclosure, poor relief, and the general topic of the manners of the people. Some replies came in very promptly and Sinclair sent copies of the four of these he judged best as samples to the ministers who had not yet responded. Initially he had intended to summarize all the reports, but appreciating their variety and individual flavour he instead put in some minor editorial work, including Webster's figures for the population of the parishes in 1755, tidied up the format, and published the whole.<br>
<br>By June 1792, 525 parish reports had come in and were being edited in Sinclair's London house by a team of young men for publication by William Creech in Edinburgh. It was the extraction of the remaining 400-odd that was the great achievement. In all Sinclair sent out over twenty circulars to goad the clergy into action. Some delayed for laziness, some out of a desire for a full report, some out of general disapproval; Sinclair wrote the report for Thurso himself, his publisher, Creech, covered Edinburgh, and the final twelve recalcitrant parishes were covered by the editorial staff. As an incentive for the clergy he had obtained through Dundas in 1792 a gift from the crown of &pound;2000 for the Society for the Benefit of the Sons of the Clergy, and the profits from the sales of the <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span> and the copyright were also given to the society. The whole project had depended for its feasibility on the privilege of franking mail enjoyed by Sinclair as a member of parliament.<br>
<br>The practical effects of the whole venture cannot be decisively identified but it seems likely that it influenced legislation. Dundas at the heart of government was prepared to note needs, and some complaints made by many reports were met. These were the burden of the tax on coals carried coastwise, the high level of some multures, and the need for increases in the stipends of schoolmasters and ministers. On all these there was legislative change between 1793 and 1810.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span> might have been expected to use all Sinclair's energies, but at the same time he was involved in meetings of the Edinburgh Highland Society, from which in 1791 he launched the British Wool Society. This was aimed at developing a better breed of sheep than was usually to be found in the highlands, but Sinclair also wanted to encourage the creation of small sheep farms which would prevent the displacement of the existing tenantry. His new society did not succeed in influencing farming in England, where the breeds and problems were completely different from those in Scotland, and in Scotland the society fell into inanition because Sinclair's agricultural interest had a new focus.<h2>
<a name="Theboardofagriculture"></a>The board of agriculture</h2>Sinclair wanted an institution such as the board of agriculture as a means of publicizing agricultural developments, advising the government, spreading information, conducting experiments, and promoting legislation. In the minor liquidity crisis of 1793, caused by the start of the war with France, he used his links with bankers to expedite the transfer of &pound;70,000 of small exchequer bills to firms in the north to stave off bankruptcies. In return Pitt agreed to the setting up of the board on an annual grant of &pound;3000, with Sinclair as its unpaid president and Arthur Young as salaried secretary.<br>
<br>The board was nearer to a voluntary society than to a branch of government. Its main element was a core of thirty-one &#145;ordinary&#146; members chosen from both houses of parliament, who included the leading agricultural publicists. These formed a closed corporation electing their own successors. To these were added &#145;official&#146; members, nineteen in all, including the great officers of state, the leading bishops, the mayor of London, and the president of the Royal Society. The board met once a week during the parliamentary session and Sinclair conducted business in its name for the rest of the year. The meetings were like those of a debating society; practical decisions were made by the president. To make the grant go as far as possible Sinclair kept the board in his own London house.<br>
<br>Sinclair had hoped that the board would conduct a survey of England similar to the <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span>, but this was frustrated by the archbishop of Canterbury, who would not allow an investigation which would lay emphasis on the topic of tithe. Instead Sinclair set on foot a series of county reports for the whole of Britain, the <span class="roman">General Views</span> series. These surveys were conducted and published in two groups, between 1794 and 1798, and between 1805 and 1814. The first series was hurriedly drawn up and received much criticism, but the second set is a valuable source.<br>
<br>The board also promoted experimental work on field drainage, advertised the merits of the plans of Macadam for road making, gave advice&#151;largely ignored&#151;on the management of the food shortage of 1795, conducted experiments on farm equipment, and in 1796 unsuccessfully tried to get a bill through parliament for the general enclosure of English agriculture, instead of the dilatory and expensive system of single acts for each parish. On this last topic the board found itself in opposition to powerful interests, particularly those of lawyers and the Church of England, and achieved only a simplification in the procedure for enclosure acts in the <span class="roman">Enclosure Consolidation Act</span> of 1801.<br>
<br>Sinclair found time in 1794 to raise a regiment of fencibles from Caithness with himself as colonel; this was a voluntary militia for home defence, called the Rothesay and Caithness fencibles&#151;Rothesay being a tribute to the prince of Wales's Scottish title. He spent six months in camp with the men, a period which gave him a long-term interest in public health.<h2>
<a name="Politics17951804"></a>Politics, 1795&#150;1804</h2>In 1795 Sinclair was close enough to the ministers to suggest the loyalty loan, a relatively unremunerative patriotic investment. It did not bring him close enough to government to help with his election problem in 1796, when Caithness did not send. He stood unsuccessfully for Orkney, and in January 1797 had to buy himself in for Petersfield. By this time the military, naval, and financial situation of the country appeared disastrous, and in February the government's heavy borrowing led the Bank of England to suspend cash payments. Both as a political economist and as a politician Sinclair was appalled and moved into opposition, where he attempted to organize a peace party. In 1798 he publicized his views in two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Letters on the State of the Nation</span> and <span class="italic">Hints on the Present Alarming Crisis</span>. He also opposed Pitt's new scheme of taxation, the increase of the assessed taxes, the conversion of the land tax, and, later, the creation of income tax, and issued a pamphlet calling for a &#145;broad-bottomed&#146; ministry. <span class="italic">The Times</span> called him &#145;the Great Scotch Rat&#146;, and Pitt called up the official members to get him deposed from the presidency of the board in 1798. Under its new president the board acquired its own house, but had, as a result, less money for projects, and in any case took some time to recover from Sinclair's inroads on its future grant. It became largely inactive.<br>
<br>For a time Sinclair continued to oppose the government, but he came to support the ministry of Addington over the making of the short-lived peace of Amiens. He also supported the union with Ireland. He had strengthened his electoral position by buying up some more superiorities.<br>
<br>Sinclair was also carrying through reorganization on his Caithness estate, and his dismissal from the presidency of the board led to closer attention to Scottish affairs, including the business of the Highland Society. He carried through the division of joint farms, the enclosure of fields, the creation of new small farms, and the setting up of model villages. He bought the estate of Langwell and attempted on part of it to turn moorland into good pasture. The experiment was a failure, but his general management of the estate sent up its value. He was an enthusiast for the spread of the Cheviot sheep, which became the common flock in the highlands. He held to most of the standard views of improving landowners&#151;their enthusiasm for enclosure, for instance, hostility to commons, and readiness to experiment with new crops. He planned the new town of Thurso, an attractive Georgian suburb. He also persuaded the British Fisheries Society to make Wick into one of its stations, with special arrangements for the availability of customs-free salt. Wick was enlarged by the building of a suburb and proved the only lasting success of the society. As with most improvers many of his experiments were expensive failures, but he was unworried by his considerable level of debt because he had been promised a legacy of &pound;61,000 by an investor in the racket of the debts of the nawab of Arcot.<h2>
<a name="Laterwritings"></a>Later writings</h2>Sinclair proposed a scheme to codify existing useful knowledge under five heads: agriculture, health, political economy, finance, and religion. In 1807 he produced a massive four-volume <span class="italic">Code of Health</span>, and in 1817 a <span class="italic">Code of Agriculture</span>. The former book cannot be considered a success, since he failed to take advantage of statistical methods in analysing the impact of disease, but the latter was used as a convenient textbook. He never completed the other planned codes. An effective publication of this period was his <span class="italic">Account of the Systems of Husbandry Adopted in the More Improved Districts of Scotland</span> of 1812.<br>
<br>The relative inactivity of the board of agriculture when Sinclair was not directing it drove him to reconsider his political position. In 1804, when the war with France restarted, he used his influence with other independents to support Pitt's bid for a return to power. He also voted against the impeachment of Dundas. In 1806 he was allowed re-election as president of the board. At once he set to work to spend the money it had accumulated by inactivity, producing the second set of county reports in the series of <span class="roman">General Views</span>, and a further <span class="italic">General Report on the Agricultural State and Political Circumstances of Scotland</span> (5 vols., 1804), a very miscellaneous collection of information which he put together himself. He made several unsuccessful attempts at a general enclosure act. When in 1813 he finally retired from the presidency the board had used up all available money and had to suspend publications for a while, but he had not run it into debt or confused its finances with his own. In the post-war years the board became a mouthpiece for the agricultural and protectionist lobby until the government stopped its grant in 1821, thereby killing it.<br>
<br>In the unexpected general election of 1806 Sinclair found himself without a seat. His attempt to get that of the Tain burghs would have succeeded only if the Kirkwall representative had failed to get to the meeting. The unexpected dissolution of the next year restored him to the Caithness seat. In this parliament he supported the Portland ministry, except for its ban on distilling. When Spencer Perceval took over he gave him steady support, and in return was made a member of the privy council in 1810.<h2>
<a name="Thebulliondebatebankruptcyandendofpoliticalcareer"></a>The bullion debate, bankruptcy, and end of political career</h2>In that same year Sinclair gave useful support to the government over the bullion issue, the debate which arose from the publication of the report on the currency position by a committee dominated by monetarist economists. This report pointed out that since the suspension of cash payments by the Bank of England the pound had depreciated by some 15 per cent against gold. The committee held that it should be brought back to its former position in two years, ignoring the discomfort and distress that drastic deflation would bring. Perceval declared that this was impossible if the war was to continue. Sinclair wrote a hurried and bulky pamphlet, <span class="italic">Observations on the Report of the Bullion Committee</span> (1810), and followed this up with another, <span class="italic">Cursory Hints Regarding Paper Currency</span>. Having in 1797 opposed the use of paper money he had now come to appreciate its flexibility and convenience, and was groping his way towards the concept of the need for an expanded circulation in an expanded economy. The resulting controversy with the authors of the bullion report, who were backed by Ricardo, was inconclusive, since neither side could appreciate the point of view of the other: in this the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (1810 and 1811) contributed an entirely personal attack on Sinclair, ranging up and down his writings for unguarded remarks. The post-war deflation showed that Sinclair's recognition of the discomfort it caused was sound.<br>
<br>Sinclair's political life ended abruptly in 1811 because he faced bankruptcy. The legacy on the debts of the nawab was disallowed by the Carnatic commissioners. Sinclair had been spending beyond his income for many years to support his various enterprises. He claimed that he had spent over &pound;1000 a year on the affairs of the board; like many agricultural improvers he had been over-optimistic on the returns from development, and keeping up houses in both Edinburgh and London had been costly. He sold off the lands and superiorities that he had bought and put the core of his inherited estate into the hands of trustees. Perceval granted him a government sinecure, the cashiership of excise for Scotland, recently reduced in value to &pound;2000 a year, and incompatible with a seat in parliament. So he stood down from Caithness and secured the seat instead for his eldest son, George. In 1815, in an effort to raise further funds, he opened a public subscription to himself: it brought in very little, and led to much mockery and a breach with his old friend and ally Sir Joseph Banks.<br>
<br>By then Sinclair had given up living in two houses. At first he brought the family to London but in 1819 he returned it to Edinburgh. He continued to write on various topics. In 1807 he had brought out the Highland Society's edition of the poems attributed to Ossian, with a dissertation on their authenticity, an unfortunate excursion into unfamiliar territory which reveals that he did not fully understand the reasons for the scepticism held by many about the authorship. His last important work was the <span class="italic">Analysis of the &#145;Statistical Account&#146;</span>, long promised but produced only in 1825. In 1831 he published his <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, two volumes of letters sent to him by various people of note in Britain and abroad. He was still working on his proposed codes of religion and of political economy, but now in old age he could not keep to his earlier schedule of twelve hours' work a day and had to settle for six. Many of his friends had advised him against writing the &#145;Code of religion&#146;.<br>
<br>Sinclair was a tall but spare man: he stood 6 feet 2 inches and weighed 11&frac12; stone. His physique is clearly shown in the full-length portrait by Raeburn in the National Gallery of Scotland. He was a man of iron constitution and enormous energy, public spirit, and optimism; abstemious and conscientious, with wide interests in practical matters, he had a very limited sense of humour and a total lack of self-criticism. All through his life he had shown a remarkable talent for hard and sustained work. He had strong family affection and trained his children to act as his secretaries. He engaged in many philanthropic activities and promoted the careers of numerous young men. He was religious in a conventional sense, but immune to the trend towards evangelicalism, except that under its influence he held daily family prayers. His genuine philanthropy is shown in his concern that improvement should not mean the displacement of the small tenantry, and a long letter that he wrote to Dundas in 1804, urging him to do something to reduce highland emigration, may have contributed to the government's programme of highland roads. The village of Hallkirk which he planned was an attempt to create smallholdings. His public spirit is shown in his willingness to serve on tiring committees which might promote development, and in his readiness to use his own money for public ends.<br>
<br>Sinclair died peacefully at his home, 133 George Street, Edinburgh, on 21 December 1835 after a short illness. He was buried on 30 December in Holyroodhouse; Lady Diana, who survived him until 22 April 1845, lies beside him.<br>
