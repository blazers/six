<span class="headword">Mary, Princess</span>  (1723&#150;1772), <span class="occ">landgravine of Hesse-Cassel, consort of Friedrich II</span>, was born on 22 February 1723 (between eight and nine o'clock in the evening) at Leicester House, London, the fourth daughter and eighth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10539/', "George II (1683&#150;1760)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4720/', "Queen Caroline (1683&#150;1737)")</script>. She was carefully brought up by her mother and, after the queen's death, by her elder sister Princess Caroline. The <span class="italic">Memoirs of the House and Dominions of Hesse-Cassel</span>, published in 1740, described her as &#145;a lover of reading, and far more solicitous to improve the mind than to adorn the body&#146;  (Hall, 127). When she was seventeen a marriage was arranged for her with Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel (1720&#150;1785), the only surviving son and heir of Landgrave Wilhelm, then ruling in Kassel as regent for his elder brother, King Fredrik I of Sweden. Parliament voted the princess a marriage portion of &pound;40,000 and the proxy wedding took place at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, in the evening of 8 May 1740, the bride's brother William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, standing in for the bridegroom. Princess Mary sailed from Greenwich on 6 June and travelled via the Netherlands to Kassel, where she was married in person on 28 June. Her husband, although tall and handsome, was profligate and brutal, and Mary's married life was very unhappy. In the October following her marriage the statesman Jacob Friedrich von Bielfeld saw her at a fancy dress ball at Herrenhausen and described her as tall, and handsome enough to be a painter's model (<i>faite &agrave; peindre</i>). Horace Walpole, who had played with her when they were both children, said she had &#145;the softest, mildest temper in the world&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 19.295) and referred to her husband as a boor and a brute. In late 1746 she paid an extended visit to Britain to recover from her mistreatment at Kassel. Mary gave birth to four sons, of whom the eldest died in infancy and the youngest was born in September 1747.<br>
<br>In 1749 Prince Friedrich was converted in secret to the Roman Catholic faith, believing that by so doing he would be reunited in the afterlife with his dying Catholic mistress. His conversion was made public in 1754, giving Mary the excuse to separate from him in February 1755. George II urged his daughter to return to England, but she felt that her place was with her young sons and she received much support from her father-in-law, since 1751 reigning landgrave as Wilhelm VIII, who provided a residence for her at Hanau, a sovereign county of the Holy Roman empire, which he had acquired in 1736 through a family arrangement. In 1757 the French invaded Hesse-Cassel and Mary with her father-in-law and children fled to Hamburg, where their circumstances were such that William Pitt the elder anticipated the meeting of parliament by remitting the sum of &pound;20,000 to provide for their immediate expenses. In 1758 a life annuity of &pound;5000 was settled on the princess. Landgrave Wilhelm VIII died at Rinteln on 1 February 1760 and was succeeded by Mary's estranged husband as reigning Landgrave Friedrich II. Wilhelm had made provision for Mary's eldest surviving son, also called Wilhelm, to become reigning count of Hanau with his mother as regent until he came of age on 13 October 1764. The landgravine, as she now was, possessed coinage rights, and very handsome thalers and half-thalers were struck bearing her bust, the coats of arms of Hesse-Cassel and Great Britain, and her name and titles in the fashion of a reigning sovereign.<br>
<br>Mary continued to reside at Hanau during her son's rule there. She continued to play an active part in the life of the British royal family from Hanau through correspondence. Her niece Caroline Matilda, queen of Denmark, was reported to have appealed for her help in 1769 against the Danish queen mother, Juliane Marie. In the same year her nephew William Henry, duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, visited her at Hanau as part of his continental tour. After suffering some years of failing health, she died at Hanau at seven o'clock in the morning on 14 January 1772. She was buried in the Reformed church (now the Marienkirche) there on 1 February. Landgrave Friedrich II married secondly on 10 January 1773 Philippine, daughter of Friedrich Wilhelm, margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, but they had no children and on his death on 31 October 1785 he was succeeded by his eldest surviving son from his first marriage, Landgrave Wilhelm IX, subsequently Elector Wilhelm I of Hesse. He and his two younger brothers, Karl and Friedrich, who both had distinguished military careers and to whom their mother bequeathed the bulk of her property, left numerous descendants, several of whom (including Edward VII's queen, Alexandra, and Mary, queen to George V) married back into the British royal family.<br>
