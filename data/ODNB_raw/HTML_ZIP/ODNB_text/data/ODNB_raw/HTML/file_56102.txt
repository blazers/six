<span class="headword">Crosse,  Lavinia</span>  (1821&#150;1890), <span class="occ">Anglican nun</span>, was born on 16 December 1821 at 45 St Giles', Norwich, the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6802/', "John Green Crosse (1790&#150;1850)")</script>, surgeon and physician, and his wife, Dorothy Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayly or Bayley (1792&#150;1870). She had three sisters and four brothers. She inherited many of her father's personal traits: decisiveness, determination, and a concern for the poor. Educated at home, her friendship with E. H. Hansell of Magdalen College, Oxford, led her to read works by Anglican divines and contemporary Tractarians. Together with Catherine Hansell she worked as a district visitor among the poor in the parish of St Peter Mancroft. In 1854 she heard John Armstrong speak at the Norwich assembly rooms in support of a penitentiary at Shipmeadow to rescue girls and women in moral danger; shortly after, on 9 January 1855, Lavinia Crosse was asked by the council of the penitentiary to supervise this home, as the founder wished to withdraw.<br>
<br>Visits to similar penitentiaries at Clewer, Bussage, and Wantage, as well as to convents on the continent, convinced Lavinia Crosse that the best way forward was as a religious sisterhood: new year's eve 1855 saw the inauguration of the Community of All Hallows by T. T. Carter of Clewer&#151;Mother Lavinia and two novices being received. Despite accusations of &#145;Romanism&#146; by the local press and the reservations of the ruling council, the sisterhood began to grow. In September 1859 a new penitentiary was opened at Ditchingham, Norfolk, having been moved there from Shipmeadow. A new convent was also completed in 1877, and the community added an orphanage, a school, and a hospital. They expanded their activities to include also mission work in Norwich and the surrounding area, and work among Native Americans in British Columbia.<br>
<br>Lavinia Crosse remained mother superior throughout her life, despite a long and painful illness. Nearly 600 women passed through the penitentiary during that time. In the words of her obituarist her &#145;attractiveness of disposition; her character&#151;spiritual-minded&#151;yet most practical; her tender heartedness and great love of justice; her indomitable energy &hellip; all had their full results&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). Although &#145;she could not endure slovenly or careless work and so was sometimes esteemed severe&#146;, this was balanced by &#145;a strong love of fun and humour which never failed even in later life&#146;.<br>
<br>Mother Lavinia's friend and mentor the Revd William Scudamore, rector of Ditchingham and first warden of the sisterhood, died early in 1881 (he had exercised a strong influence on the community's development). Her own death on 26 June 1890 occurred at Aldeburgh, whence she had gone for rest and recuperation. She was buried in the Ditchingham parish cemetery on 1 July. The strength of character and single-mindedness of Mother Lavinia ensured that the community overcame all the difficulties which beset its early years. Although the work of the community has changed with the needs of society, its survival into the twenty-first century is a lasting tribute to its first mother superior.<br>
