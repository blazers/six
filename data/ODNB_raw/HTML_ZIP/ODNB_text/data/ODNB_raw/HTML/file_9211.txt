<span class="headword">Faunt,  Nicholas</span>  (1553/4&#150;1608), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son of John Faunt of Canterbury, Kent. He came from Canterbury and was one of the first scholars to go up from King's School to Cambridge. He was admitted as a pensioner of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 27 January 1572, aged eighteen, before transferring under the Parker foundation to Corpus Christi College, graduating BA there in 1576. It has been traditionally told of Faunt that in summer 1572 he went to Paris and was there on 22 August when thousands of protestants were slaughtered during the St Bartholomew's day massacre. Faunt, along with a number of other English in Paris, sheltered with Elizabeth I's ambassador, Sir Francis Walsingham, at the embassy. In September Faunt was among the first who was able to give the queen an eyewitness account. Some scholars, however, suggest that the Faunt in Paris was a William Faunt.<br>
<br>By 1578 Nicholas Faunt had become secretary to Walsingham, now principal secretary, and was engaged in carrying dispatches to English agents abroad and sending back &#145;intelligence&#146;. During summer 1580 he was again in Paris, and met Anthony Bacon of Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, eldest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, who became his close friend and another collector of information for Walsingham. Faunt's many letters to Bacon during the course of his life provide insight into his views of the religious and political intrigues of the time. The letters Faunt wrote to Bacon while in Paris in the early 1580s in particular provide valuable background on the political scene and related foreign policy issues, while his letters once he returned to England record a great deal about activities at court. Faunt was a committed puritan, and some of his criticisms of John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, made him request that Bacon destroy his letters. Despite this request, the letters are extant. Faunt's religious commitment endeared him to Bacon's mother, Lady Bacon. She mentioned him as a role model not only to Anthony but to her other son, Francis Bacon. Yet though Faunt and Anthony were close, Francis Bacon had little time for Faunt, dismissing him as boring and pedantic.<br>
<br>Early in 1581 Faunt spent three and a half months in Germany. Later that year he also travelled to Pisa, Padua, and Geneva. Throughout the 1580s he was frequently abroad for his work; the many letters he sent home while on the continent demonstrate his assiduity at gathering information and his trustworthiness as a public servant. In November 1584 Faunt was elected MP for Boroughbridge, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, probably because Walsingham thought it would be useful to have him in parliament. While he does not seem to have played a significant role in the Commons he continued to work as an agent for Walsingham, and in February 1588 was sent to Paris at short notice. This mission was probably in order to search for information concerning the impending Armada campaign.<br>
<br>About 1584&#150;5 Faunt married the daughter of a London merchant named Archer. His strong friendship with Anthony Bacon continued. He met Bacon when he returned from the continent in ill health in 1592, bringing him to Francis Bacon's lodgings in Gray's Inn. Faunt was obviously respected. After Walsingham's death he worked for William Cecil, Baron Burghley, lord treasurer, who effectively took up the principal secretary's duties, and possibly also for Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, during the 1590s. In 1594 he obtained a grant of crown lands in Yorkshire and in October 1600 Sir Robert Cecil prevailed upon Matthew Hutton, archbishop of York, to grant Faunt a lease of archiepiscopal lands for twenty-one years which was valued at &pound;100 per annum. In 1595 Faunt was made a clerk of the signet, the small personal seal used by the secretary to authenticate documents and to authorize actions in the king's name, and in March 1605&#150;6 there was speculation of his succeeding Ralph Winwood as ambassador at The Hague, though in the end this did not happen.<br>
<br>Faunt used his experience as secretary to Walsingham to produce in 1592 <span class="italic">A Discourse Touching the Office of Principal Secretary of State</span>. Though it may well have circulated in manuscript, it was not published until 1905. Faunt had been one of Walsingham's two most confidential secretaries; he, however, suggested it would be better to combine those positions into one. Though he felt loyalty to Walsingham, he also had some criticisms of how he had managed the office. Faunt argued that Walsingham used too many assistants; this not only caused confusion but even more seriously could lead to a real breach of security. He married Abigail (<i>b</i>. in or before 1575, <i>d</i>. in or after 1608), daughter and heir of Roger Kelke, of Cambridge, and his wife, Rose, by 1594. They had three sons and three daughters, including Anthony, probably so named to honour Anthony Bacon, Faunt's closest friend. Faunt died in 1608.<br>
