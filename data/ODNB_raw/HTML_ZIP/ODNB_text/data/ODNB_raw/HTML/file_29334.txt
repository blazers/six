<span class="headword">Whitty,  Edward Michael</span>  (1827&#150;1860), <span class="occ">political journalist</span>, was born in London in 1827, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29335/', "Michael James Whitty (1795&#150;1873)")</script>, a journalist, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Neill. Educated at Liverpool Institute and at Hanover, he began his journalistic career early, working on the provincial press from 1844. In 1846 he became a shorthand gallery reporter in the House of Commons, writing the parliamentary summary for <span class="italic">The Times</span> until 1849. During the same period he was the London correspondent for the <span class="italic">Liverpool Journal</span>. He worked for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> from 1849 until 1852, when he became an editor at <span class="italic">The Leader</span>, working with George Henry Lewes and E. F. S. Pigott. While at <span class="italic">The Leader</span> he developed his best-known work&#151;parliamentary sketch writing. These columns began on 14 August 1852, and ran under the byline &#145;The stranger in parliament&#146; from 13 November 1852. His highly accurate character sketches, written in an &#145;habitually irreverent&#146; tone, with a certain &#145;pungency of expression&#146;, were received with delight or disgust, depending on the personality and sensibilities of the reader. Their style and tone were generally acknowledged to have been a strong influence on later parliamentary sketch writers, notably Grenville Murray. The early and mid-1850s were the high point of Whitty's career, and selections of his sketches were published as <span class="italic">History of the Session, 1852&#150;3</span> (1854; reprinted as <span class="italic">St Stephen's in the Fifties</span>, 1886), <span class="italic">The Derbyites and the Coalition</span> (1854), and <span class="italic">The Governing Classes of Great Britain: Political Portraits</span> (1854; expanded and reprinted 1859). The phrase &#145;governing classes&#146; was often attributed to him, although Carlyle had used it earlier. His sketches of party leaders in <span class="italic">The Governing Classes</span> were especially ascerbic. Of Palmerston (who was fifty-six at the time) he wrote, &#145;Youth, in all its virtues, as well as with all its vices, is the principle characteristic of Lord Palmerston&#146;  (<span class="italic">Governing Classes</span>, 129). He berated Gladstone for his seriousness and what he saw as his blinkered attention to his scholarly work. Of Disraeli's vanity he wrote, &#145;He does not care for abuse:&#151;let us then abuse him&#146;  (ibid., rev. edn, 1859, 208).<br>
<br>In 1857 Whitty argued with Lewes and Pigott and left <span class="italic">The Leader</span> to become editor of the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> in Belfast. He satirized the other <span class="italic">Leader</span> editors and their circle in his novel <span class="italic">Friends of Bohemia, or, Phases of London Life</span> (1857), which was first seen as a critique of literary dandyism, but later as a bitter and unnecessary attack on old friends. He left the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> and returned to London in 1858. His wife and two children died in 1859. Whitty was already a heavy drinker by the late 1850s, and this tragedy seems to have worsened this behaviour. Some of his friends became so fearful for his health that they convinced him to accept their offer of passage on a temperance ship to Melbourne, where Whitty would be able to get work on the newspaper <span class="italic">The Argus</span>. He left England in late 1859. While on the passage to Australia, Whitty drank some of the ship's doctor's medicinal alcohol. It nearly killed him immediately, but he survived to land in Melbourne. The effects of this poisoning were the most likely cause of his death at the house of a relative, soon after arriving, on 21 February 1860. A few years later, a monument to him was raised in Melbourne.<br>
