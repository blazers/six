<span class="headword">Benet,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1474), <span class="occ">priest and chronicler</span>, is differentiated from contemporaries of the same name by being vicar of Harlington, Bedfordshire, from 17 March 1443 to 1471 and then rector of Broughton, Huntingdonshire, from 4 October 1471 to his death some time before November 1474. He may have been one of two John Benets who were ordained deacon and priest between March and September 1435 in the diocese of Lincoln, but he has not been traced among the <i>magistri</i> of either Oxford or Cambridge. These are the only ascertainable biographical facts about the John Benet who wrote Trinity College Dublin manuscript 516; the rest has to be inferred from this book. This is a typical commonplace book of the period, being a collection of political ballads, religious poems, prophecies, portents and wonders, rhyming memorabilia, historical notes, and secular and ecclesiastical documents. As these indicate, Benet was an assiduous and inquisitive collector of information. He signs the text <i>quod Benet</i> in a dozen places, three of which he dates at Harlington in 1461, 1468, and 1471. At the end he writes an anathema against anyone borrowing the book without permission.<br>
<br>The central item in the book is a longish Latin chronicle of English history from Adam to 1462, and the book was bound some time after 1468, with space left for a continuation of the chronicle that was never filled. This chronicle, which was first printed in 1972, is an important primary source for political history in the period 1440&#150;62. Was John Benet the author? His only explicit personal insertion is a note of his presence attached to an eyewitness account of riots between northern and southern students in Oxford in 1441. Thereafter most of the events recorded occur in London or are national in character, often with new and significant details. The meetings of parliament, great councils, and convocation are precisely dated; the actions of the rebels under Jack Cade in 1450 are vividly described; public spectacles like executions, the burning of heretics, the abjuration of his heresies by Reginald Pecock, bishop of Chichester, in 1457, and chivalric duels are commented on; and particular attention is given to the inns and courts of law. Politically the chronicle's bias is in favour of Richard, duke of York, and hostile to the dukes of Suffolk and Somerset and the royal court. In many of these respects the chronicle has close affinities with the various London chronicles, but it is not arranged under mayoral years as they are and is more clerical in tone. Nevertheless the material must derive from someone resident in London in these years, and this rules out Benet as the primary author. Indeed Benet's own misreadings show that he was copying rather than composing the chronicle.<br>
<br>The question of whether Benet was copying the already consecutive text of another author, or compiling his own text from material written in London and sent to Harlington, is not easily answered. The argument for the latter is supported both by the miscellaneous matter collected by Benet in the rest of the volume and by the likelihood of his having lines of communication to London. His cure at Harlington was in the patronage of Dunstable Priory, while in the adjoining village of Toddington lived John Broughton, a wealthy landowner who had established a hospital and college of priests there. Broughton, who is intermittently and inconsistently referred to as a knight, was a book collector, who had contacts with the London book trade and who befriended and patronized Benet, presenting him to his living at Broughton in 1471. It seems probable, therefore, that Benet sought and received from London newsletters, documents, and reports, from which he wove his own account of the turbulent years of the mid-fifteenth century.<br>
