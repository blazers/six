</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill,  Matthew Davenport</span>  (1792&#150;1872), <span class="occ">penal reformer</span>, was born on 6 August 1792 at Suffolk Street, Birmingham, the eldest of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13313/', "Thomas Wright Hill (1763&#150;1851)")</script>, schoolmaster, and his wife, Sarah Lea (1765&#150;1842). Two of his five brothers attained professional eminence: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13299/', "Rowland Hill (1795&#150;1879)")</script>, postal reformer, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54053/', "Frederic Hill (1803&#150;1896)")</script>, inspector of prisons. Two other brothers had successful, if more obscure, careers: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13272/', "Edwin Hill (1793&#150;1876)")</script>, civil servant, and Arthur Hill (1798&#150;1885), schoolmaster. Hill's mother was the daughter of a factory worker. His father, a convert to Unitarianism, bought a school of his own in 1803 which, in 1819, after one earlier move, was transferred to Hazelwood in Hagley Road, on the outskirts of Birmingham.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandearlycareer"></a>Education, marriage, and early career</h2>Hill was educated at Wolverhampton and in his father's schools. As the eldest son of an impecunious schoolmaster, he was expected to shoulder responsibility at an early age. By 1804 he was teaching others; at the age of sixteen he was principal teacher. From about 1816 he and his brother Rowland, having become disenchanted with their father's educational ideas and methods, launched a series of reforms with the aim of making Hill Top (as it was known from 1804 to 1819) &#145;a thoroughly good school&#146;. These reforms included changes in the curriculum, for which Matthew was chiefly responsible, and the creation of an entirely new disciplinary structure, the effect of which was to place real responsibility for running the school in the hands of the pupils. These reforms were described in <span class="italic">Plans for the Government and Liberal Instruction of Boys in Large Numbers</span> (1822), which was re-issued in 1825 with <span class="italic">Public Education</span> prefixed to the title. Though published anonymously, this was probably written by Hill. The book, which was widely and favourably reviewed, won Hazelwood the admiration of Jeremy Bentham, with whom Hill became friendly; Hill also acquired an international reputation, and a large influx of new pupils.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1814 Hill entered Lincoln's Inn, thereby becoming the first person from Birmingham to go to the bar. For several years he continued to live at Hill Top, owing to his inability to support himself in London. In 1816 he began to keep terms, but it was not until 1818 that he finally left the family home. While studying the law Hill supported himself by teaching and journalism, reporting parliamentary proceedings for the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Review</span>; the latter was a weekly journal which Hill ran with two friends, John and Samuel Steer. In his teens Hill had been a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Midland Chronicle</span>. The comparative poverty and inactivity of Hill's early years as a barrister encouraged him to continue his literary activities, and he contributed to Charles Knight's <span class="italic">Quarterly Magazine</span> under the pseudonyms of William Payne and Martin Danvers Heaviside.<br>
<br>On 3 November 1819 Hill married Margaret Bucknall, the elder daughter of a Kidderminster brewer. They had six children. These included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38756/', "Florence Davenport Hill (1828/9&#150;1919)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33875/', "Hill, Rosamond Davenport")</script>], a poor-law reformer; Alfred Hill (1821&#150;1907), registrar in the Birmingham court of bankruptcy; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33875/', "Rosamond Davenport Hill (1825&#150;1902)")</script>, a member of the London school board and a juvenile reformatory activist; Matthew Hill (1834&#150;1892), professor of clinical surgery at University College, London; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56689/', "Joanna Margaret Hill (1836/7&#150;1901)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33875/', "Hill, Rosamond Davenport")</script>], who was also actively involved in social issues. Until 1851, when they moved to Bristol, the Hills lived in or near London, including in Chancery Lane, Chelsea, Hampstead Heath, and Haverstock Hill.<br>
<br>Hill was called to the bar on 18 November 1819. He took chambers at 44 Chancery Lane and joined the midland circuit. As a young lawyer he was associated with several notable cases, including <i>R. v. Borron</i>, an action arising out of the Peterloo massacre. In 1820 he represented John Cartwright, founder of the London Corresponding Society, and Jane Carlile, when she was prosecuted for selling seditious literature. Hill won the reputation of a champion of radical political causes, representing the rioters at Nottingham during the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> crisis (1831), and the Rebecca rioters in south Wales (1843). However, while Hill emphasized his radicalism when it suited him to do so, and was one of the early supporters of women's enfranchisement, he was no revolutionary. Later, as an MP, he described himself as being &#145;of Whig principles inclined to radicalism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dod's Parliamentary Companion</span>). In line with the whigs, he advocated parliamentary reform as a means of averting revolution. He favoured universal suffrage only in the distant future, accepted without question the guilt of the Tolpuddle martyrs, and criticized trades unionism as &#145;the parent of unnumbered evils&#146;. In 1848 he enrolled as a special constable to combat the Chartist threat.<h2>
<a name="Educationalandpoliticalactivities"></a>Educational and political activities</h2>After severing links with his family's school, Hill's educational interests centred upon Henry Brougham's Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK). He was present at the society's inaugural meeting and remained an active member until its demise in 1846. Hill conceived the idea for the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>, the SDUK's most successful publication, which at its height attained a circulation of approximately 200,000 copies per issue.<br>
<br>Hill was elected MP for Hull in December 1832, his candidacy having been sponsored by various leading whigs and radicals, including Lord Althorp and Thomas Attwood. Although he spoke on a range of subjects, including religious toleration, the colonization of South Australia, the abolition of &#145;taxes on knowledge&#146;, and electoral and criminal law reform, his political career was blighted by his injudicious allegation, subsequently retracted, that the Irish MP Richard Lalor Sheil was publicly opposing a coercion bill while privately supporting it. In the general election of January 1835, Hill finished bottom of the poll&#151;a victim, he insisted, of tory bribery. He never stood for parliament again.<h2>
<a name="Penalandcriminallawreformer"></a>Penal and criminal law reformer</h2>In 1834 Brougham, the lord chancellor, appointed Hill a king's counsel with a patent of precedence. Hill thereupon gave up work at the criminal bar; for several years his most lucrative field of practice was the presentation and defence of election petitions before committees of the House of Commons. He also appeared in the <i>habeas corpus</i> case of the Canadian prisoners (1838&#150;9), and for many years he represented Baron De Bode in his fruitless efforts to secure compensation for family property confiscated during the French Revolution. In May 1839, at an annual salary of &pound;300 (increased to &pound;400 a few years before his retirement in 1866), Hill was appointed recorder of Birmingham. He soon became embroiled in a bitter dispute with the town council over the court's conduct and management; this dispute was to continue for some sixteen years. More importantly, for more than a quarter of a century the recordership provided Hill with a public platform from which, through his addresses or charges to grand juries, he could air his views, particularly on matters of penal and criminal law reform. Many of these charges were collected and published as <span class="italic">Suggestions for the Repression of Crime</span> (1857). They, more than anything else, established Hill's reputation as a &#145;criminologist&#146; and penal reformer.<br>
<br>Hill was not an original thinker. Rather, he was a significant adapter, synthesizer, and publicist of others' ideas. Hill's penological views were much influenced by Alexander Maconochie, whose &#145;mark system&#146; was based on the notion of prisoners earning their release not by serving a pre-determined period of confinement but by gaining, through labour, a prescribed number of &#145;marks&#146;. Hill was instrumental in Maconochie's appointment to the governorship of Birmingham gaol (1849&#150;51). After Maconochie's dismissal, Hill became chief spokesman for the &#145;mark system&#146;. Under the influence of Walter Crofton, chairman of the directors of the Irish convict prisons, and others, Hill modified Maconochie's ideas, which themselves were not wholly original, into a scheme for indefinite confinement, release from which, if it came at all, would be earned through reformation alone. Most prisoners would pass through various stages before release, commencing with a period of severe treatment, which might include chaining, solitary confinement, and corporal punishment, and concluding, several stages later, with release on licence and post-release assistance. Recidivists, serious offenders, and those who showed no signs of reform would be imprisoned for life in high-security gaols with no prospect of release, their morale sustained simply through the prospect of improving their conditions through good conduct.<br>
<br>Hill's penal and criminological ideas have been termed harsh but they were more a combination of severity and enlightenment. Although he favoured the incarceration of suspected thieves who were unable to prove legitimate means of support&#151;a proposal which, when it was made in 1850 and again in 1851, excited a great deal of largely hostile press attention&#151;he felt that minor offences, such as garden robbery by juveniles, should attract no punishment. He also believed some first offenders could be placed on probation, that juveniles should be neither flogged nor transported, that some prisoners should gain early release on licence, and that former prisoners should receive aftercare. As recorder he was able to put some of these ideas into practice. His practical reforms included participation in the formation of two discharged prisoners' aid societies: in Birmingham in 1856 and in Bristol in 1864.<br>
<br>Whether advocating leniency or severity, Hill was guided by three principles: first, that the object of criminal jurisprudence should be the reduction of crime to the lowest possible amount, the treatment of the criminal being a means to an end, not an end in itself; second, that retribution should not be a consideration in the punishment of the offender; and third, that since the deterrence of offenders was uncertain the object of punishment should be the prevention of re-offending, either through reformation or by incapacitation, including capital punishment and permanent incarceration. It followed that he sought to assist those who genuinely wished to reform, but to punish ruthlessly recidivists, those who broke faith with the trust placed in them, and those who showed no inclination to reform.<h2>
<a name="Transportation"></a>Transportation</h2>Hill played a prominent part in the controversy over the early release of convicts on so-called &#145;tickets-of-leave&#146; or licences. In place of transportation to the colonies the <span class="roman">Penal Servitude Act</span> of 1853 provided for the initial subjection of prisoners to a harsh discipline, the severity of which would be progressively relaxed, subject to good behaviour, as the sentence proceeded. The final stage, ostensibly reserved for those who gave evidence of reformation, was early release on licence. In 1855 Hill, though a strong supporter of the ticket-of-leave principle, criticized the indiscriminate and lax way in which the licensing was administered by Joshua Jebb, chairman of the directors of convict prisons. It was revealed that Hill himself had passed excessively long sentences of penal servitude on offenders who had no chance of early release. Two years later, he criticized the <span class="roman">Penal Servitude Act</span> of 1857, which established definitively that those sentenced to penal servitude were entitled to early release, and which also allowed for the release on licence of some convicts after only thirty months in confinement. He accused Jebb and the home secretary, Sir George Grey, of thereby &#145;sapping the vitals of reformatory treatment&#146;. The garrotting panic of the early 1860s produced a public outcry against tickets-of-leave, a backlash against reformatory treatment, and an era of harshness in penal policy. By 1862 Hill was complaining to Brougham that &#145;it is next to impossible to obtain a hearing on the subject of reformatory treatment&#146;  (Brougham MSS).<h2>
<a name="Juvenilereforms"></a>Juvenile reforms</h2>On the basis that &#145;evil courses are less painful to break through in youth than in age&#146;, Hill particularly concerned himself with the problems of juvenile crime and punishment. As recorder he witnessed a cycle of juvenile crime, conviction, confinement, release, and re-offence. He favoured two strategies as a means of breaking the cycle: probation and institutional reformatory care. As counsel at the Warwick sessions Hill had seen an embryonic probation scheme in action. It had involved the return of those who were not hardened criminals into the care of respectable and responsible parents and employers. In 1841 he introduced a refined version of the scheme in Birmingham, recruiting the assistance of the borough police to monitor its operation. Although the legality of probation was &#145;questioned in high quarters&#146;, Birmingham's police believed that probation was associated with encouraging rates of reformation. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (3 Jan 1844) described it as &#145;a sound principle of correctional discipline&#146;. Encouraged, Hill urged adoption of the practice elsewhere, but when it was tried in Middlesex it failed owing to a shortage of surviving parents, co-operative employers, or responsible friends. In the 1850s, having used probation in over four hundred cases, Hill discarded it himself, preferring to send errant juveniles to reformatories.<br>
<br>Impressed by the results achieved by juvenile reformatories, especially at Mettray in France and Stretton-on-Dunsmoor in Warwickshire, Hill pressed for child offenders to be sent to institutions financed by a combination of public, parental, and charitable funds. To this end he campaigned on several fronts: in the press, in evidence to select committees, in correspondence with MPs, in charges to grand juries, and at conferences he had arranged with others of like mind. Above all, Hill made use of an extensive network of personal contacts to disseminate his views. One of those with whom he worked closely, especially after he moved to Bristol, was Mary Carpenter. Together they organized the influential reformatory school conferences which were held in Birmingham in 1851 and 1853. In the wake of the Birmingham gaol scandal, parliament passed the <span class="roman">Youthful Offenders Act</span> of 1854. This provided for Treasury and parental support for voluntary reformatory schools, to which juvenile offenders sentenced to at least fourteen days' imprisonment could be sent for periods of between two and six years. The measure did not meet all of Hill's objectives. He was particularly opposed to the preliminary punishment of offenders before transfer to a reformatory. But, as he informed Lord Brougham, he was willing to &#145;snatch at the present good within our reach and not indulge sickly taste for the Utopian&#146;  (Brougham MSS). Thereafter he did much to spread the reformatory ideal and press for swifter implementation of the 1854 act.<h2>
<a name="Otheractivitiesandinterestscharacteranddeath"></a>Other activities and interests, character, and death</h2>Hill was commissioner of the Bristol and district court of bankruptcy from 24 March 1851 to 31 December 1869, when the office was abolished. On accepting this post Hill withdrew from private legal practice; on relinquishing it he was granted a gratuity of &pound;1800. An active temperance campaigner and supporter of co-operation, Hill was a co-founder of the Law Amendment Society (founded in 1844) and prominent in the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (founded in 1857). Aside from the works already cited, Hill published numerous periodical articles and pamphlets, chiefly on legal and social questions. He edited <span class="italic">Remains of Thomas Wright Hill</span> (1859) and, with two of his daughters, <span class="italic">Our Exemplars Poor and Rich</span> (1861).<br>
<br>From his early twenties Hill was also a regular European traveller. On several occasions he toured Great Britain, Ireland, and the continent, including for the purpose of inspecting prisons and reformatories. In personality he appears to have been earnest, ambitious, pompous, and arrogant. In a sympathetic <span class="italic">Memoir</span> his daughters acknowledge his short temper, as did his brother Frederic. In appearance Hill was somewhat corpulent and, in later life, heavy-jowled. From early childhood he suffered poor health. He was subject to depression, which, unless he kept himself busy, brought on physical illness. In the 1860s ill health twice prevented him from giving oral evidence to select committees. His retirement in January 1866 from being recorder of Birmingham was occasioned by an attack of acute bronchitis. Hill's wife, Margaret, who had grown increasingly deaf with age, died on 31 October 1867. Hill himself died after a &#145;painful illness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), &#145;induced by failing strength, the result of old age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Journal</span>), at his home, Heath House, Stapleton, near Bristol, on 7 June 1872. He was buried next to his wife in Arnos Vale cemetery, Bristol.<br>
