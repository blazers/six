<span class="headword">Oliver,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1735, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the only surviving son of Rowland Oliver, a puisne judge of the court of common pleas of the Leeward Islands, and the grandson of Richard Oliver, speaker of the house of assembly in Antigua, was baptized in St John's, Antigua, on 7 January 1735. At an early age he was sent to London, where he entered the office of an uncle, Richard Oliver, of Low Leyton, Essex, who was a draper and West India merchant. On 2 February 1758 he married Mary Oliver, the daughter of his uncle; they had no children. He succeeded to his father's estates in Antigua in July 1767.<br>
<br>Oliver took up his freedom in the Drapers' Company on 29 June 1770, and on 4 July following was elected alderman of Billingsgate ward. He was a radical and a founder member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73620', "Society of Gentleman Supporters of the Bill of Rights")</script>, which pressed for reform of government and redress to Wilkite grievances. The radicals controlled the City of London at this time, and when a by-election was called in July 1770 Oliver was elected MP, after the original radical candidate, his brother-in-law Thomas Oliver, had withdrawn from the contest because of ill health. He continued to represent the City until the dissolution of parliament in September 1780, and used his platform in the house to support reforming measures, such as Serjeant Glynn's motion for a committee to inquire into the administration of criminal justice.<br>
<br>Oliver's most notable appearance in the House of Commons came in March 1771, during the celebrated <i>Printers' case</i> and the subsequent struggle between the City and the Commons. In a deliberate attempt at confrontation, Lord Mayor Crosby and aldermen Wilkes and Oliver arrested a messenger of the Commons. The Commons sought to punish Crosby and Oliver, both MPs, choosing to ignore Wilkes. Due to the illness of Crosby, much of the house's attention was focused on Oliver, who declined to defend himself and defied the Commons, stating that he had acted according to his conscience. An angry Lord North moved for his commitment to the Tower of London, which was carried by a large majority in the house, after midnight in the debate of 25 March 1771. When the parliamentary session closed on 8 May, Oliver and Crosby were released from the Tower and conducted in a triumphal procession to the Mansion House. The City showed its gratitude to Oliver by presenting him with a silver-gilt cup in March 1772, and he was elected a general of the Honourable Artillery Company in August 1773.<br>
<br>Soon after the <i>Printers' case</i>, Oliver split with Wilkes, having already refused to serve as sheriff with him in April 1771. Oliver was elected to that office with Watkin Lewes on 1 July 1772. He joined the faction of radicals led by Home and Townshend, who formed the Constitutional Society in opposition to Wilkes. The friends of Wilkes were so enraged at the election of Townshend as lord mayor in 1772 that they appear to have accused Oliver &#145;of having taken the vote of the court before their party had arrived&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, ed. Fitzmaurice, 2.289). Oliver, however, continued to speak in opposition to the government and in favour of reform. He supported Sawbridge's motion to shorten the duration of parliaments and opposed the administration's policies towards the American colonies. By September 1778 he had decided to retire from parliament at the next general election, and he declined to stand for the mayoralty. He resigned his gown at a court of aldermen held at the Guildhall on 25 November 1778, and shortly afterwards sailed to Antigua in order to look after his West Indian estates. He died on 16 April 1784, on board the packet-boat <i>Sandwich</i>, while returning to England from Antigua.<br>
