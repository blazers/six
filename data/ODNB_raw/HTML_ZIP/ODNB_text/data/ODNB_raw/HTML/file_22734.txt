<span class="headword">Preston,  William</span>  (1742&#150;1818), <span class="occ">printer and writer</span>, was born on 28 July 1742 in Edinburgh, the second son of William Preston (<i>d</i>. 1751), writer to the signet, and Helena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cumming, of Edinburgh. He was educated in Edinburgh, first privately and then at the high school, and left the University of Edinburgh, presumably without a degree, in 1757.<br>
<br>Preston then became assistant to the grammarian Thomas Ruddiman (1674&#150;1757), during which time he compiled a catalogue of Ruddiman's books, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Romana</span> (1757). After Ruddiman's death in 1757 Preston spent a year as apprentice to Ruddiman's brother Walter (<i>fl</i>. 1753&#150;1801), a printer in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1760 Preston went to London with a letter of recommendation to William Strahan (1715&#150;1785), the king's printer. Strahan hired Preston as principal corrector to the press, and Preston was later made superintendent. Strahan's firm was one of the largest and most prosperous printing houses in eighteenth-century London. It printed Johnson's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, Gibbon, Hugh Blair, David Hume, Adam Smith, and other notable authors. As manager and chief corrector of the press, Preston was on friendly terms with these authors, and prospered with Strahan as the business grew. In 1773 Preston married Sarah Couchman Stamp, a widow with one son.<br>
<br>In 1763 a group of Edinburgh men in London, including Preston, formed a masonic lodge (formally constituted as the Caledonian in 1772). His interest in masonic scholarship grew, and he began regularly to meet other masons to discuss masonic practice. This work culminated in an address to a masonic gala in 1772 which was attended by the most prominent freemasons in England. Later in that year Preston published a major work, <span class="italic">Illustrations of Masonry</span>, which included the text of his address along with descriptions of ceremonies, a historical account of freemasonry, and songs. <span class="italic">Illustrations</span> was immediately successful and influential; it brought a standardization to masonic practice hitherto lacking. Preston continued to revise the text, seeing nine English, two American (1804, 1816), and three German (1776, 1780, 1786) editions published in his lifetime. It continued to be revised by others after his death, and also exists in several facsimile editions.<br>
<br>After his first public address Preston continued to give numerous lectures on the masonic craft. He wrote for the <span class="italic">Freemason's Calendar</span> and was a master of the lodge of Antiquity, no. 1, one of England's four oldest lodges. He served as assistant to the secretary of the grand lodge and was appointed official printer to the grand lodge. In 1779 Preston, among others, renounced allegiance to the grand lodge of England and established a rival lodge. The secession did not thrive, however, and Preston was restored to his grand lodge privileges in 1789.<br>
<br>He was made a member of the Stationers' Company in 1794. On his death, William Strahan left Preston an annuity and the firm was inherited by Strahan's son Andrew, who made Preston chief reader and general superintendent, and eventually, a full partner in 1804.<br>
<br>William Preston died after a long illness on 1 April 1818 at his home at Dean Street, Fetter Lane, London, and was buried on 10 April near St Paul's Churchyard. Part of his estate endowed a yearly Prestonian lecture which is administered by the grand lodge of England.<br>
