<span class="headword">Rawdon, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1604&#150;1684), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born in November 1604, the only son of Francis Rawdon (1581?&#150;1668) of Rawdon Hall in the West Riding of Yorkshire and Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of William Aldborough.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-one George Rawdon became private secretary to Edward, Viscount Conway, secretary of state, and after Conway's death in 1631 he acted as secretary and agent to his son, also Edward, second Viscount Conway. Increasingly Rawdon was to reside on Conway's Ulster estates, particularly at Brookhill, near Lisburn, co. Antrim, leasing and purchasing Irish land on his own behalf. He proved an active agent, recruiting tenants from England for Conway's estates, engaging in legal activity, and drawing up plans for &#145;improvement&#146;, a recurrent theme in his career. An extensive correspondence he conducted with members of the Conway family has survived, covering several decades from the 1630s, and treating of all manner of aspects of life in east Ulster and beyond.<br>
<br>Rawdon married (probably in 1635) Ursula, daughter of Sir Francis Stafford of Portglenone, co. Antrim, and his wife, Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Grogan), and widow of Francis Hill. She and their only child died the following year. In 1639 he was involved in enforcing the &#145;black oath&#146; repudiating the national covenant upon the Scottish inhabitants of Ulster. He was returned for Belfast to the Irish parliament of 1640. He had held a captaincy in the Irish army since 1635, and with the outbreak of the 1641 rising he returned from London to assist in the assembly of local forces to counter the insurgents. His own residence, at Brookhill, was pillaged and burnt. He participated in successive campaigns, attaining the rank of major. In the aftermath of the cessation negotiated between Charles and the Catholic confederates in September 1643 his reports that Ulster officers sought peace in England but war in Ireland, appear to have reflected his own views. Certainly he engaged in the renewed fighting in Ulster from 1644, and by 1647 was in London seeking additional support from parliament for the protestant forces in Ireland.<br>
<br>By the late 1640s tensions within the protestant camp in Ulster were high, and Rawdon won praise for his support of the English parliamentarian interest against the Scots in the province from parliament's commander, George Monck, with whom he was to sustain a friendship. He held a series of offices in Ulster in the 1650s including those of commissioner for confiscated lands, revenue commissioner, and JP and participated in schemes for ecclesiastical reform. He was elected for the combined counties of Antrim, Down, and Armagh to the 1659 protectorate parliament. He rebuilt Brookhill, consolidated his landholdings, especially around Moira, co. Down, and was rewarded by the state with further land grants. Like his neighbour Arthur Hill he combined service to the Commonwealth regimes with a departure from their religious preferences, the only point of contact being a common suspicion of presbyterianism. Instead, at Conway's request, he gave shelter to the future bishop, Jeremy Taylor, and remained in close contact with him after his elevation to the see of Down and Connor in 1661.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1659 Rawdon journeyed to Scotland to consult Monck on political developments. In the following spring he was elected to the Irish Convention for co. Antrim and, with the restoration of Charles II under way, travelled to London to represent the interests of the military in Ireland and subsequently the convention itself. He was elected in 1661 to the Irish parliament for Carlingford, and was appointed a privy councillor and a commissioner to execute the proposed land settlement. Following his own representations he was created a baronet on 20 May 1665. Retaining the confidence of the new government, he continued to oppose presbyterian activities in Ulster. Ongoing concerns about covenanter insurgency in Scotland lent force to his suspicions and his hostility to any policy of indulgence. As late as 1681 he remarked to Conway, concerning an application to build a presbyterian meeting-house, that it &#145;is near 50 years we have lived here in peace and I shall not willingly admit any such interruption in my days&#146;  (Bailie, 8).<br>
<br>Rawdon's lands, principally in co. Down, but also in counties Louth, Meath, and Dublin were confirmed to him, and further augmented, by the Restoration regime. He undertook additional purchases, and the construction of the co. Down market towns of Moira and Ballynahinch. He persisted with efforts in agricultural improvement and industrial diversification, both on his own property and as agent for Conway. Although not all his ventures proved successful, his efforts at road improvement won him contemporary praise as &#145;the Best High Way man in the kingdom&#146;  (Hill, 385). His energetic engagement was crucial to the rise of Lisburn as a commercial centre in south Antrim and the site of the new cathedral and a leading local school.<br>
<br>On 4 September 1654 Rawdon had married his second wife, Dorothy Conway (<i>d</i>. 1676), eldest daughter of the second viscount, and his wife, Frances (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Popham), with whom he had seven sons and three daughters. He died on 18 August 1684 and was buried in Lisburn Cathedral ten days later. Only one of Rawdon's sons survived him, Sir Arthur Rawdon, second baronet, who was in turn grandfather of John Rawdon, fourth baronet and first earl of Moira.<br>
<br>George Rawdon's career draws together many of the strands of English settlement in seventeenth-century Ulster: the acquisition of land and the harnessing of resources in economic improvement, building, and the construction of an urban and communications network; the blending of military and civil office; and a commitment to the fortunes of the established church. In his case such aims were pursued with unusual energy and an interpretation of the &#145;English interest&#146; which would allow for co-operation with the interregnum regimes, but also a hostility towards presbyterianism which caused him to remark, using the language of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> 8, that his &#145;troublesome neighbours&#146; &#145;the Scots presbetry &hellip; esteem me one of the horns against the Kirk&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1647&#150;60</i>, 662).<br>
