<span class="headword">Balfour,  John Blair</span>, first Baron Kinross  (1837&#150;1905), <span class="occ">advocate and politician</span>, born at Clackmannan on 11 July 1837, was the second son (in a family of two sons and a daughter) of Peter Balfour (1794&#150;1862), parish minister of that place, and his wife, Jane Ramsay (<i>d</i>. 1871), daughter of Peter Blair of Perth. Educated at Edinburgh Academy, of which he was &#145;dux&#146; (leading scholar), he passed to the University of Edinburgh, where he had a distinguished career, but did not graduate. Passing to the Scottish bar on 26 November 1861, he rose with almost unexampled rapidity to be the foremost advocate in Scotland, his only rival being Alexander Asher. On 4 August 1869 he married Lilias Oswald, daughter of Donald Mackenzie, Lord Mackenzie, judge of the supreme court of Scotland. She died on 19 June 1872, having had one son. On 6 April 1877 he married Marianne Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 25 Sept 1913), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18947/', "James Moncreiff, first Baron Moncreiff")</script>, lord justice-clerk of Scotland. They had four sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Balfour first engaged prominently in politics at the general election of April 1880, when he contested North Ayrshire, as a Liberal, against Robert William Cochran-Patrick, afterwards permanent under-secretary for Scotland. Balfour was defeated by fifty-five votes, but was returned unopposed for Clackmannan and Kinross on 1 December 1880 on the appointment of W. P. Adam, the sitting member, as governor of Madras. Appointed immediately solicitor-general for Scotland in Gladstone's second ministry, he in 1881 succeeded John McLaren as lord advocate. He was made honorary LLD of the University of Edinburgh in 1882, and became a privy councillor in 1883. He remained in office until the Liberals lost power in 1885. For nearly 150 years before 1885 the lord advocates had been practically ministers for Scotland; but during Lord Salisbury's short-lived administration of 1885&#150;6 the ancient office of secretary of state for Scotland, which had been abolished at the close of the Jacobite rising of 1745&#150;6, was revived. Balfour was thus the last of the old line of lord advocates, and, though he was always stronger as a lawyer than as a politician, managed the affairs of Scotland with ability in the face of considerable difficulties caused by the crofter question and the movement in favour of home rule for Scotland. In 1886 he was again lord advocate, but left office when the Gladstone government was defeated in June that year on the Irish question. In 1885&#150;6 and again in 1889&#150;92 he was dean of the faculty of advocates. From 1892 to 1895 he was once more lord advocate under Gladstone and Lord Rosebery, and, during that period, took a prominent part in carrying through the House of Commons the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> for Scotland (1894), by which parish councils, framed on the model of the English act, were established.<br>
<br>The defeat of the Rosebery government in June 1895 was the end of Balfour's official career; but at the ensuing general election he was again returned by his old constituency, and remained in parliament until 1899. In that year the lord president of the Court of Session, James Patrick Bannerman Robertson, became a lord of appeal, on the death of William Watson (Lord Watson), and so high was the estimation in which Balfour was held that the Conservative government bestowed on him the vacant office. &#145;I have never in my life known an appointment which gave such universal pleasure&#146;, Lord Rosebery said at a banquet given by the Scottish Liberal Club in honour of Balfour's appointment. On 15 July 1902 Balfour was raised to the peerage as Baron Kinross of Glasclune. His health, which had begun to fail before he left the bar, broke down rapidly after he became a judge. Balfour died on 22 January 1905 at 6 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh, and was buried in the Dean cemetery there.<br>
