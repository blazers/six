<span class="headword">Lacy,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1370&#150;1455), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was the son of Stephen Lacy of Gloucester and his wife, Sybil; his brother Philip later became an esquire in his household. Edmund Lacy was educated at Oxford, where he is first mentioned as a master of arts in 1391; he had graduated BTh by 1400 and DTh by 1414. He also held a fellowship of University College (<i>c</i>.1391&#150;1396), serving as bursar (1396&#150;7) and master (1398&#150;9, and perhaps until <i>c</i>.1401). After ordination as priest about 1399 he soon gained entry to royal service. By November 1400 he had become a king's clerk and began to receive preferment from Henry IV and others, including canonries at Windsor (1401), Hereford (1412), and Lincoln (1414). References to his employment on diplomatic missions, however, result from confusion with John Catterick (<i>d</i>. 1419); Lacy made his mark primarily as a theologian and liturgist, and with Henry V rather than his father. On 14 April 1414 Henry V made him dean of the Chapel Royal; he went on the French campaign of 1415 and was present at Agincourt. Election as bishop of Hereford followed, evidently at the king's wish, between 21 January and 17 February 1417, and Lacy was consecrated at Windsor in Henry's presence on 18 April. In 1420 he was translated to the larger and wealthier diocese of Exeter by papal provision dated 3 July. When Henry promoted the reform of the Benedictine order in May 1421, Lacy was one of those who conferred with the order, and he preached before its monks and the king at Westminster.<br>
<br>After Henry's death in the following year Lacy was one of the late king's executors, but he subsequently centred his activities upon his diocese of Exeter, except for occasional visits to London&#151;in 1428 he presided in convocation. When, by 1435, he developed a disease of the shin bones which prevented his riding, he was excused attendance at royal councils and parliaments. As long as his health permitted he was active in visiting his diocese (Cornwall as well as Devon), but in 1447 he was obliged to appoint a suffragan on account of his own advanced age and infirmity. Lacy was clearly a conscientious bishop whose diocesan registers for both Hereford and Exeter survive&#151;that for Exeter contains 874 folios, yet still fails to include all his sealed acts. It contains large numbers of grants of indulgences and licences for chapels. At Exeter Cathedral he increased the stipends of the vicars-choral and choristers at a time of economic hardship by appropriating the tithes of Cornwood, Devon, to their use in 1430&#150;32. He issued indulgences to encourage the completion of the cathedral cloister, and defended the dean and chapter in disputes with the city of Exeter which reached a crisis in the late 1440s. His preferred interests, however, were intellectual and spiritual. He wrote <span class="italic">De quadruplici sensu Sacre Scripture</span>, now lost, and took a particular interest in music. The John Dunstavylle whom he appointed canon of Hereford Cathedral in 1419 may have been the composer John Dunstaple (<i>d</i>. 1453), while at Exeter, Lacy maintained a chapel choir and patronized such musicians as Richard Smert, Nicholas Sturgeon, and John Trouluffe. He had a particular devotion to the Virgin, in whose honour he instituted an antiphon and prayers in the cathedral, and to the Archangel Raphael, patron of healing&#151;a more unusual attachment, perhaps reflecting his own infirmity. In 1444 the pope approved a liturgy composed by Lacy for a festival of Raphael on 5 October, and the bishop tried to promote the festival, which won acceptance at Exeter, Hereford, and (in 1454) York. He gave Exeter Cathedral numerous vestments, ornaments, and books.<br>
<br>Lacy lived to be at least eighty, acquiring a reputation for sanctity; in 1447&#150;8 the mayor of Exeter, albeit an opponent, referred to &#145;his blessedness, holy living and good conscience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Papers of John Shillingford</span>, 44). He died at the bishop's manor of Chudleigh, Devon, on 18 September 1455, and was buried in a plain altar tomb on the north side of the choir in Exeter Cathedral. The tomb became the centre of an unofficial cult, attracting pilgrims and monetary donations. Wax votive offerings found near the tomb in 1942 suggest that the devotees often suffered (like the bishop) from diseases of the limbs; the cult was suppressed about 1538 by the then dean of Exeter, Simon Haynes.<br>
