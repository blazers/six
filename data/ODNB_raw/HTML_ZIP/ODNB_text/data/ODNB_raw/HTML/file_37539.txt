<span class="headword">Herschel, Sir  William James</span>, second baronet  (1833&#150;1917), <span class="occ">developer of fingerprinting and judge</span>, was born on 9 January 1833, probably in Slough, the eldest child of the three sons and nine daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13101/', "Sir John Herschel, first baronet (1792&#150;1871)")</script>, astronomer and chemist, and his wife, Margaret Brodie, daughter of Alexander Stewart, Presbyterian minister of Blair Atholl.<br>
<br>Herschel was educated at Clapham grammar school and the East India Company's college at Haileybury. He arrived in Bengal in 1853 and was posted to Malda as an assistant magistrate. In later years he served as magistrate of Midnapore (1866&#150;71), district judge of Dinajpur (1871&#150;2) and Nadia (1872&#150;4), commissioner of Cooch Behar (1874&#150;5), and magistrate of Shahabad (1875&#150;7) and Hooghly (1872&#150;8). On 19 May 1864 he married (Anne) Emma Haldane, youngest daughter of Alfred Hardcastle of Hatcham House, Surrey. She died at the birth of their second son on 5 October 1873, leaving two older girls, a boy, and the baby in Herschel's care.<br>
<br>In 1858 at Jangipur, while still a relatively junior civilian, Herschel realized that taking and recording fingerprints could prevent impersonation. Over the next fifteen years he noted that not only were the ridge and furrow patterns of each individual's prints unique, but they never changed. In 1877, as magistrate of Hooghly, he instituted the first known system of fingerprinting as a means of combating fraudulent contracts, false pension claims, and prisoner substitution. Although the scheme enhanced his reputation among local Bengalis as an incorruptible administrator, he received no official encouragement for his work and in 1878 he resigned the service and returned to England. Fingerprinting was not to be formally adopted in India until 1897.<br>
<br>Despite claims to prior discoveries made by Henry Faulds, who was the first to publish on the subject, Herschel is generally recognized as the pioneer of fingerprinting. His work was built upon by Sir Francis Galton and Sir Edward Henry, whose systematic methods had practical applications for the detection of criminals, and to whom with characteristic modesty he paid tribute in his book <span class="italic">The Origin of Finger-Printing</span> (1916).<br>
<br>Back in England, Herschel settled at Oxford. There he became an unattached member of the university and in 1881, at the age of forty-eight, was awarded a first-class degree in theology. Typical of him, wrote a friend, was his readiness to &#145;clothe himself in the humility of the commoner's gown&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span>, 2 Nov 1917). For a few years he lectured in divinity at Hertford College and in 1911 published <span class="italic">A Gospel Monogram</span>. Living at Lawn Upton, Littlemore, he undertook many philanthropic and religious activities, including work for the Temperance Society, and set about recording the local dialect, a task subsequently taken up by his younger daughter, Emma Dorothea. He was a member of the Oxfordshire county council from 1895 to 1904. Inspired perhaps by his father's early photographic inventions, he took a special interest in colour photography and presided at the national photographic convention in Oxford in 1901.<br>
<br>In 1908 Herschel moved to Warfield, Berkshire. He died at home in Rectory House, Warfield, on 24 October 1917 and was buried in the family vault in Hawkhurst, Kent, on the 27th. His elder son, John Charles William (<i>b</i>. 1869), succeeded him as third baronet. On his death in 1950 the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
