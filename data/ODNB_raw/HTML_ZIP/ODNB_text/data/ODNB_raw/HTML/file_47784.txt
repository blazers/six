<span class="headword">Henderson,  Alexander</span>, first Baron Faringdon  (1850&#150;1934), <span class="occ">stockbroker and financier</span>, was born at 25 Upper Winchester Street, Islington, London on 28 September 1850, the second son of the six sons and three daughters of George Henderson, printer, proof corrector, and Greek and Hebrew scholar, of London, and his wife, Eliza Cockshott, the daughter of a cabinet-maker. He was probably educated at a private day school in Ealing, where the family had moved, and in 1867 he became a clerk in the office of the leading City accountant, William Welch Deloitte.<br>
<br>In 1872, Henderson joined Deloitte's former partner, Thomas Greenwood, who had become a stockbroker specializing in railways. He became a member of the stock exchange in 1872 and in 1873 a partner in Greenwood &amp; Co. The next year, he married Jane Ellen Davis (<i>d</i>. 1920), the daughter of Edward William Davis, gentleman of Ealing. Greenwood retired in 1884, to become an assistant to the preacher C. H. Spurgeon, and Henderson made his brother Henry (1862&#150;1931) a partner in 1886. The firm became broker to most of the mainline British railway companies, as well as many lines in Spain and Latin America, including the Central Argentine Railway, Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway, and the Central Uruguay Railway. Henderson was also involved with port developments, telephones, electricity, and tramways throughout Latin America, where he was well placed as a result of family connections. His brother Frank (1858&#150;1935) settled in Montevideo, but the most important link was his youngest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55211/', "Brodie Henderson (1869&#150;1936)")</script>, who was apprenticed to the engineer, James Livesey (1833&#150;1925), the consultant on many of the railways with which Henderson was involved. In 1891 Alexander bought Brodie a partnership in Livesey's firm, which allowed him to co-ordinate the engineering and financial interests of the family in ventures such as the Trans-Andes Railway. Both Alexander and Henry acquired large personal investments in these concerns, as well as acting as brokers for the firms.<br>
<br>Henderson was also involved in domestic ventures. In 1887 he assumed responsibility for financing the Manchester Ship Canal, and he was a director from 1890 to 1897. He acquired an interest in the Shelton ironworks in Staffordshire at some point before 1891; and in 1894 he became director of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway. The intention was to convert this local company into a trunk line between Manchester and London, and Henderson was crucial to providing the necessary finances. He created a rolling-stock trust, which bought equipment for the railway to use on hire purchase, and he raised finance in the City. In 1899, he became chairman of what had become the Great Central Railway. He had grandiose schemes. In 1900 he formed a company to build a dock at Immingham on the Humber, and the Great Central announced that it would take a lease; the new dock opened in 1912. However, the Great Central largely duplicated existing services and never lived up to its ambitions. By 1907 Henderson was planning an amalgamation with the Great Northern Railway. Terms were agreed in 1908&#150;9, but the bill was rejected by the Commons. The Great Central was eventually absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway in the reorganization of 1922, and Henderson was deputy chairman until his death. His last major achievement in international finance came in 1901, when he was responsible for the merger of the small British tobacco firms into the Imperial Tobacco Company in order to face American competition.<br>
<br>In 1889 Henderson bought a country house and estate of 3500 acres at Buscot Park, near Faringdon, in Berkshire. Most of the day-to-day business at Greenwoods was left to Henry, and Alexander was freed to spend more time on two pursuits: animal breeding and collecting works of art. (Ownership of Buscot, with its collections, passed to the National Trust.) He became president of the Shire Horse Society and the Hampshire Downs Sheepbreeder's Association. He purchased paintings both by old masters and by the Pre-Raphaelites, most strikingly Burne-Jones's sequence of <span class="italic">The Legend of the Briar Rose</span>. Increasingly, however, he became involved in politics, winning West Staffordshire in a by-election in 1898 as a Conservative, a seat which he held until 1906. He re-entered parliament in a by-election in 1913, for St George's, Hanover Square, which he held until he was made a peer in 1916. He was committed to imperial preference, and was both treasurer of the Tariff Reform League and a member of the tariff commission. He also acted as a conduit for Conservative Party funds to supportive newspapers, and it was in part for his services to central office that he obtained a baronetcy in 1902. He provided financial backing to the newspapers of C. Arthur Pearson, the chairman of the league; he acquired the <span class="italic">Standard</span> and <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> in 1910, and was a shareholder in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>.<br>
<br>Henderson's business interests followed suit as he increasingly turned to the empire, and especially to the construction of railways in Africa in association with his brother Brodie. He acquired control of the Shire Highlands Railway around 1900, and built a major extension; he was also a creditor of the British Central Africa Company until 1912, when the debts were paid by a competing railway promoter in return for abandoning a further extension by the Shire Highlands Railway. His major business venture before the war was the creation of the National Bank of Turkey in 1909, in association with Sir Ernest Cassel and John Baring, Lord Revelstoke. The bank had been encouraged by the Foreign Office, as a response to the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which was dominated by French interests, but subsequent Foreign Office support was minimal. The hopes of developing railways, public works, and industry were disappointed, and the National Bank complained that the Foreign Office did not back its attempt to involve British capital, in co-operation with German banks, in extending railways. The problems were exacerbated when the ships it financed for the Turkish navy were seized during construction by the British government at the outbreak of war. Furthermore, the bank was responsible, with Royal Dutch Shell and Calouste Gulbenkian, for the formation of the Turkish Petroleum Company in 1911, which held the exploration rights for large parts of the Middle East, with the significant exception of the concession to William Knox D'Arcy in Persia. This led to conflict with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which, with backing from the British government, argued for the transfer of the bank's shares. Transfer was finally achieved in 1925, shortly before a huge oilfield was discovered in Iraq. Henderson's concerns for the future of British production, which had led him to support tariff reform, and his disappointment at the lack of government support for British business overseas in competition with the Germans, was to have a new urgency during the war.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Henderson visited Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands to inquire into the blockade; he was deputy chairman of the shipping control committee; he chaired a committee to consider the relationship between the consular and diplomatic services in order to improve commercial intelligence; and he served on the Balfour committee on commercial and industrial policy. He argued on the Balfour committee that exports should be increased if the country were not to be bankrupted by surplus capacity after the war, and he submitted a minority report in favour of a 10 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> duty on imports. He took his case further as chairman of a committee appointed in 1916 to consider the financial facilities for trade. The committee recommended an industrial trading bank to overcome what was seen as the complacency of the City, and in 1917 the British Trade Corporation (BTC) was formed, of which he was governor until 1926. The proposal owed much to Dudley Docker, who believed that the main purpose of the political system was to expand foreign trade and develop British economic power, which were essential to survival as a nation. The venture arose from the feeling that German industry before the war, especially large firms such as AEG and Siemens in electrical engineering, were destroying their British rivals as a result of backing by the banks, and particularly in exports. Victory on the battlefields was not enough; measures had also to be taken to develop engineering to dominate world markets. The aim of the BTC was to assist industry in financing large overseas contracts, on more generous terms than were offered by banks; information offices were to be opened in cities throughout the world. It was also argued that the German firms achieved their dominance as a result of protection. Support for the scheme came from the large engineering, munitions and electrical exporters such as Vickers and Armstrong, which led to suspicion among smaller firms, which feared that policy was being dominated by monopolists; Henderson himself saw, quite correctly, that the main difficulty was in raising finance for small and medium concerns&#151;the point made by the Macmillan committee in 1931. The BTC also met opposition from the merchant banks, which resented the suggestion that they had failed industry: the existing financial system was, they argued, perfectly adequate for British circumstances. The downfall of the BTC, however, was the tension, which was never resolved, between strategic and commercial considerations.<br>
<br>The government had been willing to support the BTC during the war as a means of countering German commercial dominance, especially in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and in order to protect oil supplies. It was, in this sense, a continuation of the National Bank of Turkey, and in 1919 the BTC purchased the bank for &pound;243,119. It also acquired the Levant Company and a merchant house trading in the eastern Mediterranean; it invested in the Portuguese Trade Company, formed the Anglo-Brazilian Commercial and Agency Company with the London and Brazilian Bank, and participated in the Inter-Allied Trade and Banking Corporation. It formed the South Russia Banking Agency to assist the allied support of White Russia, and attempted to develop a trade in manganese ore, before the victory of the Red Army. Like the National Bank, the BTC soon ran into difficulties, for its investments were not commercially viable and it received little support from the Foreign Office, which was wary of trade diplomacy. It did not pay any dividends after 1920 on an issued capital of &pound;1 million, and went into voluntary liquidation in 1926. The assets were acquired by the Anglo-International Bank, of which Henderson became a director, and he bought back the assets of the National Bank of Turkey. Henderson felt that it was &#145;more than ever desirable to keep the flag flying&#146;  (Davenport-Hines, <span class="italic">Dudley Docker</span>, 148), an attempt which had cost him in all &pound;643,500. His war-time efforts were, however, rewarded by a peerage in 1916, and the Companionship of Honour in 1917. He sat on one final committee, that on national expenditure in 1921&#150;2.<br>
<br>The firm of Greenwood &amp; Co. became less central to the activities of Henderson, and most of his wealth was outside the stockbroking business. There had been a reluctance to bring in outside partners, and it was clear that Alexander's two sons did not have sufficient dynamism. His elder son was Lieutenant-Colonel G. H. Henderson, who died in 1922, twelve years before his father. Alexander's brother Henry died in 1931, and his surviving son died in 1933, shortly after Greenwoods merged with Cazenove Ackroyd in 1932. The new firm became one of the most respectable brokers in the City; family members continued to be partners, and the office manager of Greenwoods, William Brabner, who handled Henderson's personal affairs, was given specific responsibility for the family investments. Apart from expertise in Latin America, Greenwoods brought a major asset to the merged firm&#151;investment trusts. In 1909 Henderson created the Witan Investment Trust to handle his personal finances and to supervise the various family settlements; by 1924 its book value was &pound;2,148,487.<br>
<br>Alexander Henderson died on 17 March 1934 at his home, 18 Arlington Street, Westminster, and was buried at Eaton Hastings church near Buscot. After his death Brabner created the Henderson Administration to handle the assets of the family, which included &pound;1,117,408 left by Alexander in 1934, &pound;423,327 left by his brother Henry in 1931, and a total of &pound;936,532 left by his two sons in 1922 and 1933. Management of the investments was the responsibility of Charles Micklem, one of the senior partners in Cazenove. Micklem, with James Capel, dominated the trust market in the 1930s. By servicing investment trusts, both inside the firm and outside, Micklem secured a regular income from broking, and the family's assets benefited from the firm's best deals.<br>
<br>Henderson's name survived in the City through the activities of Henderson Administration, which proved more successful than many of the ventures with which he had been involved since the 1890s. By the time of his death, his campaign for imperial preference was being realized; but it cannot have been any consolation to the right-wing imperialist Henderson that his heir, his grandson Gavin Henderson, second Lord Faringdon (1902&#150;1977), was closely involved with the Labour Party and an ardent anti-colonialist. What many of Gavin's colleagues in the Labour Party did accept was the need for improved financial and government support for production, but of a type with which Henderson and Docker would have had little sympathy.<br>
