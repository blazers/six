<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Prinsep,  Henry Thoby</span>  (1792&#150;1878), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was the fourth son of <a name="cosubject_65458"></a><span class="headword">John Prinsep</span>  (1746&#150;1830)<span class="occ"></span> and his wife, Sophia Elizabeth Auriol (1760&#150;1850), sister of James Peter Auriol, secretary to the government of Warren Hastings, whom he married in Calcutta in 1782. Having gone out to India as a military cadet in 1771, John Prinsep had resigned the military service immediately and made a considerable fortune in trade. He trafficked chiefly in indigo, of which industry he may be regarded as the founder, and introduced into Bengal the printing of cotton fabrics. He returned to England in 1787 and settled at Thoby Priory in Essex; he was MP for Queenborough (1802&#150;6) and an alderman of the city of London. He published in 1789 <span class="italic">A Review of the Trade of the East India Company</span>, and this was followed by pamphlets on the cultivation of sugar cane in Bengal and on other East Indian topics. In his later life, after considerable losses in trade, his city influence procured his appointment as bailiff to the court of the borough of Southwark, with a salary of &pound;1500 a year.<br>
<br>Henry Thoby Prinsep was born at Thoby Priory on 15 July 1792. At the age of thirteen he went to Mr Knox's school at Tonbridge, and in 1807, having obtained a writership to Bengal, he entered the East India College, then recently established at Hertford Castle. He left the college in December 1808, and arrived at Calcutta on 20 July 1809, at the age of seventeen. After spending two years in Calcutta, first as a student in Fort William College, where he came to know Holt Mackenzie, and afterwards as an assistant in the office of the court of <i>sadr adalat</i>, he was sent in 1811 to Murshidabad, where he was employed as assistant to the magistrate, and also as registrar, a judicial office for the disposal of petty suits. After serving in the jungle mahals and in Bakarganj, Prinsep was appointed, in 1814, assistant to the secretary to the governor-general, Lord Moira (afterwards marquess of Hastings), whom he accompanied on his tour through Oudh and the North-Western Provinces (1814&#150;15). He was subsequently (1816) the first holder of the office of superintendent and remembrancer of legal affairs&#151;an office established for the protection of the interests of the government in the courts in the provinces. His tenure of the post was interrupted by summonses to join the governor-general's camp during Lord Hastings's second tour (1817&#150;18), which embraced the period of the Pindari wars and the third war with the Marathas; the governor-general, who was also commander-in-chief, exercised the chief command. At the close of the Anglo-Maratha War, Prinsep obtained the permission of the governor-general to write <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Political and Military Transactions of British India under the Administration of the Marquis of Hastings, 1813 to 1818</span>. He sent the completed manuscript to his elder brother, <a href="#cosubject_22810">Charles Robert Prinsep [<i>see below</i>]</a>. A letter to George Canning, president of the Board of Control, from Lord Hastings recommended that the publication of the work should be sanctioned, but, without reading the manuscript, Canning prohibited it. Charles Prinsep, however, decided to publish on his own responsibility, and placed the manuscript in the hands of John Murray, who brought out the book in 1820. The proofs were sent to the Board of Control, where they were seen by Canning, who, on reading them, approved of the work. The book is generally considered to be the best and most trustworthy narrative of the events of that time. The original edition was revised, extended to 1823, and republished in two volumes, when the author was in England on leave, in 1825.<br>
<br>In 1819 and 1820, while still holding, as his permanent appointment, the office of superintendent and remembrancer of legal affairs, Prinsep was employed upon more than one special inquiry. The most important was an investigation into the condition of the land tenures in the district of Burdwan and the adjoining country. The principal landowner in these districts was the raja of Burdwan, who paid over 40 lakhs of rupees, representing in Prinsep's time over &pound;400,000 sterling, as annual revenue to the government. The raja had introduced the system of letting his estates in large blocks, called <i>patni taluks</i>, to tenants who were called <i>patnidars</i>, on payment of large sums of money as bonus; these again sublet them to under-tenants called <i>darpatnidars</i>, by whom they were again further sublet; so that there were sometimes five or six middlemen between the raja and the cultivating ryot. The tenure of the <i>patnidars</i> was, by stipulation, perpetual and hereditary, and gave to them all the rights and authority of the raja over the subtenants; the result was much confusion and litigation, difficulty in collecting the raja's dues, and risk to the government revenue. Prinsep, after a thorough inquiry, came to the conclusion that there was no security for the government revenue, and no remedy for the existing confusion, unless a law were passed that, on default of the <i>patnidar</i>, all the middlemen who derived their rights from him should fall with him. He accordingly drafted a regulation, which was passed into law as regulation 8 of 1819, which remained in force in Bengal for the rest of the century.<br>
<br>From that time Prinsep was recognized as one of the ablest men in the service, and his promotion to high office was assured. On 16 December 1820, before he had been twelve years in India, he was appointed Persian secretary to the government on a salary of 3000 rupees a month; and except on two occasions (1824&#150;6, 1832&#150;4), when he was compelled by the state of his health to leave India for a time, he never left the secretariat until he was appointed a member of council, first during a temporary vacancy in 1835, and five years later, when he was permanently appointed to the office. He finally retired from the service and left India in 1843.<br>
<br>During his long service Prinsep was brought into close contact with a succession of governors-general, including lords Hastings, Amherst, William Bentinck, Auckland, and Ellenborough. Many years afterwards, in 1865, he wrote a valuable but unpublished autobiographical sketch of his official life, in which he recorded his impressions of each of these men. Of Lord Minto, whom he saw only from a distance, Prinsep had a poor opinion, although he gives him credit for the firmness he displayed in the operations against Java. He regarded Lord Hastings's nine-year administration as &#145;a glorious one&#146;, which had &#145;nearly doubled the revenues and territories of the East India Company, and established its diplomatic influence over the whole peninsula of India&#146;. Lord Amherst he describes as a courteous gentleman, and a ready and fluent speaker, but he &#145;lacked confidence in his own judgment and was by no means prompt in decision&#146;, and &#145;had extraordinary notions of the importance of a very punctilious ceremonial&#146;. He had a high admiration for John Adam, who was acting governor-general for seven months in 1823, and on his death in 1825 wrote a memoir of Adam at the request of his family, which was published in the <span class="italic">Asiatic Journal</span> for 1825.<br>
<br>The governor-general upon whom Prinsep is most severe is Lord William Bentinck. He regarded him as addicted to change for the mere sake of change, as unduly suspicious of those who worked under him, and too much given to meddling with details; but he gives him credit for honesty of intention, especially in the distribution of his patronage. The two men differed essentially in character. Lord William was a strong liberal, while Prinsep was a conservative to the backbone. On the education question Prinsep was strongly opposed to the policy, initiated by Macaulay and supported by Bentinck, of imposing English as the language of instruction. The policy ultimately adopted was a compromise in deference to Prinsep's opposition. Later on, during the interregnum in which Sir Charles Metcalfe officiated as governor-general, Prinsep, while not opposing the act to give freedom to the press of India, predicted gloomily, and without any real justification in his lifetime, that &#145;the native press might become an engine for destroying the respect in which the government is held&#146;.<br>
<br>Prinsep appears to have been on very friendly terms with Lord Auckland throughout his administration, but he regarded him as slow to take decisions, and timid of his responsibilities. He entirely disapproved of Auckland's Afghan policy, and foretold the failure of the policy of supporting Shah Shuja.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1843 Prinsep settled in London. His ambition at that time was to enter the House of Commons, and he contested no less than four constituencies as a Conservative candidate, the Kilmarnock burghs (1844), Dartmouth (1845), Dover (1847), and Harwich (1851, twice). At the last of these places he was returned, but was unseated by petition on technical grounds. He then canvassed for a seat in the court of directors of the East India Company, to which he was elected in 1850. He took a prominent part in the discussions at the India House, and when the number of directors was reduced from twenty-four to eighteen (six being crown nominees) under the act of 1853, he was one of those elected by ballot to retain their seats. In 1858, after the East India Company's rule was superseded by that of the crown, and the Council of India was established, he was one of the seven directors appointed to the new council.<br>
<br>Prinsep served in the Council of India until 1874, displaying the same activity and conservatism which had characterized his whole official life. He recorded frequent dissents from the decisions of the secretary of state. He was much opposed to some of the measures adopted after the mutiny. He emphatically disapproved of the transfer of the East India Company's European regiments to the British army, and joined on that occasion with thirteen other members of the council in a written protest against the course taken by the cabinet in deciding this question before the Council of India had been consulted on it. He also disapproved of the original scheme for the establishment of staff corps for India, and especially of that part of it which provided for the appointment of officers from the line for Indian service. He was much opposed to the re-establishment of the maharaja of Mysore after the state had been administered since 1831 by British officers; the rendition of Mysore finally took place in 1881. On financial grounds he opposed the works undertaken to improve the navigation of the Godavari River, which subsequently, owing to their enormous cost, had to be abandoned. In his last year of office he recorded a protest against the adoption of the narrow, or metre, gauge for Indian railways.<br>
<br>Busy as was Prinsep's official life, he found time to write a number of works on Indian subjects, including <span class="italic">Origin of the Sikh Power in the Punjab</span> (1834), <span class="italic">Tibet, Tartary, and Mongolia: their Social and Political Condition</span> (1851), and an exhaustive pamphlet, <span class="italic">The India Question in 1853</span>, when the <span class="roman">Charter Act</span> of that year was under discussion. He also brought out the work of Ramchunder Doss (Ramachandra Dasa) entitled <span class="italic">Register of the Bengal Civil Servants, 1790&#150;1842, Accompanied by Actuarial Tables</span> (1844), a subject to which he had given a good deal of attention. He also wrote verses; in his old age he printed for private circulation <span class="italic">Specimens of Ballad Poetry Applied to the Tales and Traditions of the East</span> (1862). He kept up his classical studies to the end of his life. When failing health brought him sleepless nights, he often whiled away the time by translating the odes of Horace into English verse. He was a keen mathematician. Only a few days before his death he worked out a new method of proving the forty-seventh proposition of the first book of Euclid.<br>
<br>Prinsep's domestic life involved him in a very different circle from that of his official career. On 14 May 1835 he married Sara Monckton (1816&#150;1887), daughter of James Pattle of the Bengal civil service; she was one of seven sisters known for their beauty and talents, including the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron and Virginia, Countess Somers. The Prinseps had a daughter and three sons. Through his sister-in-law Virginia he met the artist G. F. Watts, and when the Prinseps set up their home at Little Holland House, Kensington, Watts joined them and remained an inmate of their house and a recipient of their patronage for some twenty-one years. Under the guidance of Sara Prinsep, Little Holland House became one of the artistic and literary centres of London, where Tennyson, Browning, and Thackeray mingled with Du Maurier, Ruskin, and Burne-Jones. The Prinseps' second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35615/', "Valentine Cameron Prinsep")</script>, became an artist of the aesthetic movement. It was at Watts's house at Freshwater on the Isle of Wight that Henry Thoby Prinsep died on 11 February 1878.<br>
<br>Of Prinsep's numerous brothers one, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22812/', "James Prinsep")</script>, is separately noticed. Another, <a name="cosubject_22810"></a><span class="headword">Charles Robert Prinsep</span>  (1789&#150;1864)<span class="occ"></span>, was admitted a pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 23 May 1806, and proceeded BA in 1811 and MA in 1814. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in Trinity term 1817. He was the author of <span class="italic">An Essay on Money</span> (1818) and a translation of J. B. Say's <span class="italic">Political Economy, with Notes</span>, 2 vols. (1811). He was created LLD in 1824, practised at the Calcutta bar from 1824, and was advocate-general of Bengal (1852&#150;5). He died at his home, Rothbury House, Chiswick Mall, Chiswick, Middlesex, on 8 June 1864.<br>
