<span class="headword">Taverner,  Richard</span>  (1505?&#150;1575), <span class="occ">translator and evangelical reformer</span>, was probably born at Brisley, Norfolk, the eldest of the four sons of John Taverner (1457?&#150;1545) of North Elmham, Norfolk, and his first wife, Alice, daughter and heir of Robert Sylvester of Brisley. Educated initially at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Richard transferred to the newly founded Cardinal College, Oxford, where he graduated on 21 June 1527 and was among those accused of heresy in 1529. His move to Oxford may partly reflect the influence of his kinsman the composer John Taverner, who was master of the choristers at Cardinal College and was also charged with heresy. Returning to Cambridge, where he was incorporated BA in 1529, Richard Taverner proceeded MA the following year, but was then persuaded to go abroad to study. But the friend who had been supporting him died, and late in 1530 Taverner wrote to Thomas Cromwell appealing for help from the king. Cromwell persuaded the duke of Norfolk to provide an annuity and Taverner returned to Cambridge, remaining there until 1534, probably as a fellow of Gonville Hall.<br>
<br>In 1532 Taverner sent Cromwell his translation of Erasmus's <span class="italic">Encomium matrimoni</span>, presented as an attack on clerical celibacy, which inaugurated his work as &#145;the most prolific populariser of Erasmus whom England produced&#146;  (McConica, 117), as well as anticipating the assault on religious houses. For Taverner, Erasmus was &#145;the incomparable lerned man&#146;  (Wooding, 29). Within the year he was contributing to official apologetic for the royal divorce, and had come to be identified as Cromwell's publicist. In a letter to Cromwell on 2 July 1533, Martin Tyndall, a fellow of King's College, offered a translation of Erasmus's life of Colet: &#145;Let Master Taverner, last year master of Greek in Cambridge, now your client, oversee it&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 6, no. 751). Taverner also studied law at Strond Inn, one of the inns of chancery, proceeding thence to the Inner Temple, &#145;where his humour was to quote the law in Greek, when he read any thing thereof&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 1.420). He was at court by 1534, while in 1536 or 1537 Cromwell secured his appointment as one of the clerks of the signet, though he maintained close contact with the minister. In August 1537, when investigating the advowson of Brisley church in Norfolk, he reported that he was preparing to marry. His wife was Margaret, daughter of Walter Lambert of Chertsey, and they had four sons and three daughters. In January 1539 Taverner was granted the lease of Alvingham Priory and two rectories in Lincolnshire, making him financially independent.<br>
<br>Taverner became Cromwell's principal propagandist for religious reform. As well as putting a protestant face on Erasmus in translation, he produced &#145;at the commaundement of his Master&#146; English versions of the Augsburg confession with the <span class="italic">Apologie of Melanchthon</span> in 1536. Christoff Mont, Cromwell's German specialist, had introduced Henry VIII to Sarcerius's <span class="italic">Loci communes</span> (1528), which Taverner translated in 1538, with a prefatory epistle to Henry VIII explaining why it was to be preferred to Melanchthon's <span class="italic">Loci</span>, itself dedicated to the king: &#145;this tempreth his penne also to the capacitie of younge students of scripture&#146;. Taverner expressed the moderation in doctrinal controversies of continental protestant humanists, who &#145;have denied freewyl onely in spirituall mocyons and that also in such persons as be not yet regenerate and renued by the holy ghost&#146;  (sig. A5). Nevertheless, his promotion of <i>sola scriptura</i> as the solution to doctrinal conflict was combined with the anti-papal polemic of the supremacy to urge that &#145;we all togither with one accorde, followynge your highnes as our heed and myghty shepherde maye utterly vomyt out of us all papysticall venym, and hertely at last imbrase the pure and syncere verite of gods moost holy worde&#146;  (sigs. A4<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). In 1539 he translated Capito's psalm paraphrases as the <span class="italic">Summe or Pith of the 150 Psalmes of David</span>. The conservative <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> (1539) prohibited the printing of unorthodox religious books, which may account for the removal of reference to Capito in the second edition of the <span class="italic">Summe</span>, the <span class="italic">Epitome of the Psalmes</span>, printed later that year. Between 1538 and 1540 he directed the operations of Richard Bankes's press, which published his works at this time.<br>
<br>Taverner's activity as a biblical translator stemmed from the need to revise the controversial 1537 <span class="roman">Matthew Bible</span>, itself a revision of Tyndale by John Rogers:<blockquote>Rogers's attacks on clerical celibacy, on purgatory, and on fasting were all eliminated, as was the comparison of the Pope to Anti-Christ, with a consequent change in tone from a distinctly Protestant work to a moderate and characteristically Erasmian compromise. (McConica, 165)</blockquote>The 1539 <span class="roman">Taverner Bible</span> was itself replaced later that year by the <span class="roman">Great Bible</span>, a far more thorough revision. Although a Greek scholar, Taverner was no Hebraist, and he employed the Latin <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> and the recent Latin translation by Pagninus for his <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> revisions. However, his <span class="roman">New Testament</span> revisions bring the text closer to the original Greek, anticipating the <span class="roman">Rheims Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Taverner retreated from Lutheran translation after Cromwell's fall in 1540; the act of attainder against the minister included a charge of having circulated heretical works. Having been briefly in Stephen Gardiner's custody, Taverner turned to Erasmus's humanist works as sources for a series of proverb collections, probably unsponsored. He was the first English translator of the <span class="italic">Apophthegmata</span>, upon which he drew heavily for <span class="italic">The Garden of Wysdom</span> (1539), and also included select <span class="italic">Adagia</span> in the &#145;thyrde boke&#146;: &#145;these works form one of the greatest repositories of Erasmian adages and classical wisdom made available to the sixteenth-century English reader&#146;  (McConica, 184). Taverner also drew on the <span class="italic">Opuscula aliquot</span> for subsequent expansions of his collection, often adding his own glosses in order to support the royal supremacy and the Henrician settlement, blending protestantism and humanism in his comments on contemporary affairs. The <span class="italic">Epistles and Gospelles</span> (1540), partly written and overseen by Taverner, was intended to supply the want of &#145;plentie of sobre modeste and sincere teachers&#146; to feed the Christian flock &#145;not with rash erronyouse, hereticall or fabulous sermons, but sobre, discret, catholike, and godly instructions&#146;. Substantial sections of these postils for each Sunday mass, which Cranmer edited, were later included verbatim in the Elizabethan <span class="italic">Book of Homilies</span>.<br>
<br>On 2 December 1541 Taverner once more found himself in Gardiner's custody, this time for failing to report the rumour that Anne of Cleves was pregnant by Henry VIII:<blockquote>This abominable slander was told to Taverner, of the Signet, by his mother-in-law, wife of Lambert, the goldsmith, and by his own wife, who said they had it of Lilgrave's wife and old ladye Carowe. Taverner kept it secret till Sunday, when he told Dr. Cox, who informed the Lord Privy Seal. (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 16, no. 1414)</blockquote>The others were also imprisoned, as was a brother of Taverner, who was not released until March 1542. Richard himself was soon released, however. In 1544 he served in the army in France, and in April of that year acquired the manor of Woodeaton, Oxfordshire, along with former monastic lands there, and began building. In 1544 or 1545 the king gave him the site of the dissolved Franciscan priory at Northampton; in the following year he received &#145;Nun's acres&#146;, part of the lands of Stamford Priory, and in 1546 other lands in Horningtoft, Norfolk.<br>
<br>In 1545 translations of Erasmian works advocating reform began to make a tentative reappearance, among them Taverner's version of <span class="italic">De amabili ecclesiae concordia</span>, now lost, in support of the king's appeal to parliament for mutual toleration within the English church. Taverner may have been involved in the compilation of the <span class="italic">King's Primer</span>, published in the same year, which included some of his translations of Capito. Nevertheless his translations of Melanchthon and Sarcerius were burnt at Paul's Cross in 1546.<br>
<br>In 1547 Taverner was returned to parliament as MP for Liverpool. He probably owed his seat to evangelical patronage, perhaps that of Sir William Paget, who became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster in the same year. After parliament was dissolved in 1552 he received a licence to preach, even though not ordained. He is said to have preached at court before Edward VI, and in public both during his reign and that of Elizabeth, &#145;wearing a velvet bonnet or round cap, a damask gown and a chain of gold about his neck&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 1.420). At Mary's accession he lost his position as clerk of the signet, but lived unmolested at Norbiton Hall, Surrey&#151;his chosen residence while building work proceeded at Woodeaton. In 1558 he addressed a congratulatory Latin epistle to Elizabeth. He declined the offer of a knighthood, but served as a JP for Oxfordshire, and was high sheriff of the county in 1569.<br>
<br>In January 1562 Margaret Taverner died. Richard subsequently married Mary, daughter of Sir John Harcourt of Stanton Harcourt. They had a son, Harcourt, and a daughter, Penelope; she was the maternal grandmother of the Oxford antiquary Anthony Wood, who preserved valuable family reminiscences of Richard Taverner. The latter died at Woodeaton on 14 July 1575 and was buried beside Margaret in the parish church there on 29 July. In his brief will (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/57, fol. 242<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>), drawn up on 15 June, he divided his lands into three parts and bequeathed a third each to his sons Peter and Edmond. The last third, not disposed of in the will, may have been intended for the eldest son, Richard, who, however, was only specifically left a gold chain, and was not made an executor&#151;perhaps the two men had quarrelled. Two daughters were left sums of money, and a fourth son, John, was to have &#145;all my Lattin and Greek books&#146;. Along with Peter and Edmund, John was both an executor and a residuary legatee.<br>
<br>The Taverners were a talented family. The eldest of Richard's younger brothers, <a name="cosubject_27007"></a><span class="headword">Roger Taverner</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1572), <span class="occ">surveyor and writer</span>, is said by Wood to have studied at Cambridge, albeit without graduating. But this is not confirmed by university records. Probably in the 1540s he was made a surveyor for the court of augmentations, becoming Sir Francis Jobson's deputy, and was later employed in the same capacity by the exchequer until 1573. A number of his reports on crown woods survive (in BL, Lansdowne MSS 43, 56, 62). It may have been Jobson who secured Taverner's election to parliament in 1555 as a member for Newport iuxta Launceston, Cornwall. He wrote several tracts on economic issues, for instance &#145;Remedies &hellip; of derth of victualles&#146; (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 376), whose dedication to Queen Elizabeth mentions a similar work sent to her two years previously. More influential, though unprinted, was his &#145;Arte of surveyinge&#146; of 1565. He made his will on 6 January 1578, but it was not proved until 5 February 1582. With his wife, a member of the Hulcote family, he had three sons, one of whom, John, is reported by Wood to have also become a surveyor.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_27005"></a><span class="headword">John Taverner</span>  (1584&#150;1638), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the second son of Richard's second son, Peter, who had established himself at Hexton, Hertfordshire. He was educated first at Westminster School and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated <i>c</i>.1597, became a scholar in 1599, graduated BA in 1602, and proceeded MA in 1605. He was incorporated at Oxford on 10 March 1606. He was secretary for nine years to John King, bishop of London between 1611 and 1621, and was also professor of music at Gresham College from 1610 to 1638; drafts of some of his lectures survive (as BL, Sloane MS 2329). Ordained deacon in London on 24 December 1620 and priest on 13 March 1625, in 1624 he became vicar of Tillingham, Essex, resigning that benefice in 1629 to become vicar of Hexton and rector of Stoke Newington. Still holding both livings he died between 26 and 29 August 1638 and was buried at Stoke Newington.<br>
