<span class="headword">O'Leary,  Joseph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1795&#150;<em>c.</em>1845), <span class="occ">songwriter and journalist</span>, was born in Cork. In his youth, possibly after the death of his father, he joined a company of strolling players, but his theatrical experience was short, as the manager was insolvent. About 1818 he started to write for the Cork papers&#151;notably, <span class="italic">The Freeholder</span>, a scurrilous sheet which was edited by John Boyle, and lasted until 1842. O'Leary's contributions were considered very powerful; he was likened to Swift by Denny Lane, and it was in its columns that his famous Bacchanalian song &#145;Whiskey, drink divine&#146;, appeared. About 1818 he also wrote for <span class="italic">The Bagatelle</span>, a short-lived Cork periodical; and for a time he edited the <span class="italic">Cork Mercantile Reporter</span>. Between 1825 and 1828 he wrote for <span class="italic">Bolster's Cork Quarterly</span>, and contributed poems under the pseudonyms &#145;O'&#146; and &#145;O'L&#146;, and sketches as Denis Murphy, to two London periodicals, the <span class="italic">Dublin and London Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Captain Rock in London</span>. In 1825 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Dublin and London Magazine</span> an anonymous article, &#145;Bettheen-a-Vryne&#146;; the song &#145;Glenfinnishk&#146;, which concludes it, appeared in several anthologies of Irish poetry. Richard Ryan, the Irish biographer, who seems to have known him, says that he was, in 1826, preparing a translation of Tibullus. In 1830 O'Leary published a pamphlet <span class="italic">On the Late Election in Cork</span>, under the signature of &#145;A Reporter&#146;. There are also some poems by him in Patrick O'Kelly's <span class="italic">Hippocrene</span> (1831); and in 1833 a small collection of his poems and sketches appeared at Cork in an anonymous, possibly autobiographical, volume, entitled <span class="italic">The Tribute</span>. In 1834 he went to London and joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> as parliamentary reporter. After this date little about O'Leary's life can be verified. It is said that he was one of the earliest writers for <span class="italic">Punch</span>. But despite praise for his &#145;racy sketches&#146; he seems to have met with little material success in London, and it is conjectured that he drowned himself in the Regent's Canal about 1845. It is also possible that he returned to Cork and died there.<br>
<br>O'Leary has been confused with the &#145;Irish whiskey-drinker&#146;, John Sheehan, who translated &#145;Whiskey, drink divine&#146;, into Latin.<br>
<br>Another contemporary <a name="cosubject_20702"></a><span class="headword">Joseph O'Leary</span>  (1792&#150;1857), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born in Dublin, the eldest son of Jeremiah O'Leary of Cork. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1820 and published in Dublin the standard legal works <span class="italic">Law Tithes in Ireland</span> (1835), <span class="italic">Rent Charges in Lieu of Tithes</span> (1840), and <span class="italic">Dispositions for Religious and Charitable Uses in Ireland</span> (1847). He died in 1857.<br>
