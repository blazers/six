<span class="headword">Dawks,  Ichabod</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1661, <em>d.</em> 1731), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was baptized on 22 September 1661 at St Mary's, Westerham, Kent, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7341/', "Thomas Dawks (1636&#150;1689)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7340/', "Dawks, Thomas")</script>], printer, and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brooker (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1638/9). By his own account, in 1672 he began to work with his father at John Darby's in Bartholomew Close, London. He continued under his father's supervision when the latter moved in 1673 to join Anne Maxwell's and Elizabeth Flesher's establishments and in 1674 set up on his own in Blackfriars. Ichabod was freed by patrimony on 6 November 1682. On 3 August 1687 he married Sarah (1657?&#150;1737), whose surname is unknown. On his father's death in August 1689, Ichabod and his mother, Anne, succeeded to the business, of which Ichabod became sole proprietor about 1693. Between 1693 and 1725 he kept thirteen apprentices. He became a liveryman of the Stationers' Company on 5 August 1700. His work address in 1705&#150;31 is given as at the west end of Thames Street, near Puddle Dock.<br>
<br>Ichabod is best remembered for his thrice-weekly newspaper <span class="italic">Dawks's News-Letter</span> (1696&#150;1716). The earliest existing issue, number 23, is dated 13 August 1696, and the latest 22 December 1716 (BL set). Closely modelled on the older manuscript newsletters, Dawks's venture employed a script type whose effect lay between the intimacy of handwriting and the impersonality of newspapers in roman type. The text type, bought from the Grover foundry, was presumably cut to Dawks's order. Identified as the &#145;Scriptorial english no. 2&#146; displayed in the James's Specimen of 1782  (Mores), it is also shown, recast from the original matrices, in Morison's <span class="italic">Ichabod Dawks</span>. Foreign news predominated, with the fourth and final page left blank for late news. There were no advertisements. Dawks also published two short-lived news sheets in roman type: the <span class="italic">Philosophical Observator</span> (first issue 22 January 1695) for John Whitlock, and on his own behalf the <span class="italic">Protestant Mercury, Occurrences Foreign &amp; Domestic</span> (first issue 9 March 1696). As imprints reveal, he printed many books, often on his own account, especially in the field of popular science and medicine. The copyrights of some of these he had inherited from his father. For many years he also printed two almanacs for the Company of Stationers. Dawks died in London on 27 February 1731, and was buried on 4 March at Low Leyton, Essex. His widow Sarah was still printing in 1736.<br>
