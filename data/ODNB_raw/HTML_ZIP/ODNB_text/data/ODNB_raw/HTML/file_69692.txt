<span class="headword">Strevens,  Peter Derek</span>  (1922&#150;1989), <span class="occ">linguistic scholar and applied linguist</span>, was born on 31 August 1922 in the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, Norwich, the elder son and first of three children of William Strevens (1893&#150;1982), master mariner of Trinity House, and his wife, Dorothy Lydia (1895&#150;1983), daughter of John William Henry McCarthy of Ramsgate, Kent.<br>
<br>Strevens was educated at Ackworth School, Pontefract, from 1936 to 1938 and served in the Friends' Ambulance Unit in the Second World War from 1940 to 1945. He then studied French with subsidiary German at University College, London (BA honours with upper second in 1948); this was followed by a Rhosten scholarship to research into Portuguese phonetics for a year. On 1 June 1946 he married Gwyneth Moore (1924&#150;2002), daughter of Harold Moore, of Birmingham, at the Friends' meeting-house in Bull Street. Their son Jason was born in 1951 in Accra after Strevens began his career at the University College of the Gold Coast, as lecturer in phonetics from 1949 to 1956. He moved to Edinburgh University, where from 1957 to 1961 he was a major influence on the innovative postgraduate applied linguistics course being developed there.<br>
<br>From 1961 to 1964 Strevens held the chair in contemporary English at the University of Leeds, and for the following ten years the first British chair with the designation &#145;applied linguistics&#146; at the University of Essex, where he set up the second major postgraduate programme in this field. From 1966 to 1970 he was secretary of the International Association of Applied Linguistics, and from 1972 to 1975 the second chairman of the British Association for Applied Linguistics. Frustrated by the amount of committee work in British universities, he moved to the private sector, becoming director-general of the Bell Educational Trust in Cambridge (where he was a fellow of Wolfson College) from 1978 to 1988, and combined this with chairing the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language from 1983 to 1987. In 1988 he was distinguished visiting professor in the humanities at Eastern Michigan University, and at the time of his death was professor at the University of Illinois.<br>
<br>Following Strevens's return to Britain from Africa, he played a key role in developing and defining the new discipline of applied linguistics across the world. The book he co-wrote with Edinburgh colleagues Angus McIntosh and Michael Halliday, <span class="italic">The Linguistic Sciences and Language Teaching</span> (1964), was the most influential of its generation in defining a scientific, but by no means mechanistic, foundation for teaching foreign languages. In the 1960s boom in language interest, reflected both in the emergence of markets for English in the developing world and the concern for European languages as the European Common Market defined itself, this book became the centrepiece of reading lists at postgraduate level. The masters course at Essex was the first in applied linguistics in Britain, and for many years graduates from there and from his earlier base, Edinburgh, were the major British leaders in the field, both at home and overseas. At the same time he recognized that effective applied linguistics could not be tied to the burgeoning market for teachers of English as a foreign language: particularly in the period before leaving Essex, he collaborated with her majesty's inspectorate for schools and with other agencies in developing a research base for the teaching of modern languages in Britain. As his publications show, throughout his career he was a major leader in widening the scope of applied linguistic research beyond a concern solely for language teaching.<br>
<br>Strevens published influential books on phonetics, the theory of language teaching, and teacher education, and was also concerned, through a series edited for Oxford University Press, to establish greater awareness of the history of language teaching. He collaborated in the development of Seaspeak (1984), international English for maritime communication, which was established as the international language of the sea. His <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> recreations were travel and the sea, so that his extensive work for the British Council and other international bodies arose directly from his personal enthusiasms and interests. At the same time he was highly professional. When the post-oil-crisis demand for English in many parts of the world led to a market in which there was much scope for sharp practice and over-enthusiastic promotion of shoddy products, he constantly worked to ensure that systematic analysis, serious research, and a well-educated teaching force supported the expansion of English teaching. Thus his shift from university to private sector work made sense, for it enabled him to address the professional needs of the increasingly powerful private language schools, and to counter the risks of over-aggressive marketing in a field where maintenance of professional standards was essential.<br>
<br>Above all else, though, Strevens charmed his colleagues and audiences. No one was better at facilitating rich professional contacts. He supported colleagues and students alike, and was constantly called upon in situations where personal relationships might be difficult to manage. When the long-standing organizer and founder of the International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language, Dr W. R. Lee, had to be persuaded that change was needed in the association, Peter Strevens proved an ideal successor, incorporating his predecessor in the activities of the association while ensuring that it addressed the needs of new generations of teachers. His belief that all teachers and scholars needed personal support as well as academic criticism contributed to the affection he earned throughout the language-teaching professions. But he was not simply a promoter of great skill, for his lucid writing made many language teachers more aware of the principles they were unconsciously using. His clear and elegant manner of speaking, clarity of thinking, and outstanding committee skills ensured that social relations between diverse cultures, people of diverse levels of sophistication and education, and diverse linguistic groups would always be positive. An outstanding command of French, particularly, and a wide-ranging mind enabled him to cross boundaries within Europe as much as in the British Commonwealth where so many of his students had worked. He died suddenly of a heart condition in Tokyo, Japan, on 3 November 1989.<br>
