<span class="headword">Lowe,  John</span>  (1750&#150;1798), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Kenmure, parish of Kells, East Galloway, the son of a gardener at Kenmure Castle. Having left the parish school he was apprenticed in New Galloway with John Heron, hand-loom weaver, father of Robert Heron (1764&#150;1807). He improved his education at Carsphairn parish school, and with the help of friends (he was handsome, talented, and always popular) entered Edinburgh University in 1771 to prepare for the church. He studied for two sessions, being tutor in the interval in the family of Mr M'Ghie of Airds on the Dee, East Galloway. He became engaged to Jessie M'Ghie and found the subject for &#145;Mary's Dream&#146;, his chief lyric, in the grief of her sister, whose lover, a ship surgeon, had been recently drowned. Near the house he had constructed an arbour in which he studied and which, known as &#145;Lowe's seat&#146;, Burns piously visited when he was in the neighbourhood in 1793.<br>
<br>Doubtful of success in the Scottish church Lowe went to the United States in 1773 as tutor to the family of a brother of George Washington, leaving Jessie behind to follow at an unspecified date. Later he ran a private school at Fredericksburg, Virginia, which failed in 1784. There he shortly afterwards took orders and obtained a living as a clergyman of the Church of England. For a time he was, at least poetically, faithful to Jessie but he was at length fascinated by a beautiful Virginian, whose indifference impelled him to marry her more accommodating sister &#145;from a sentiment of gratitude&#146;. Burns reproved this treatment of Jessie, and the marriage proved unhappy. When Lowe discovered that his wife was unfaithful he began to drink, and a downward spiral ensued. He died in poverty in December 1798 of an overdose of laudanum, at Windsor Lodge, Culpepper county, Virginia, and was buried in the cemetery of Little Fork church, in the same county.<br>
<br>The remaining fragments of Lowe's poems (quoted from manuscript by Gillespie and Murray in their notices of him) show a vein of deep genuine feeling. His command of pathos is fully displayed in &#145;Mary's Dream&#146;, his only complete lyric, which seems to have circulated in Galloway in a printed form before appearing in any collection. When Robert Hartley Cromek was preparing his <span class="italic">Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song</span> (1810) Allan Cunningham foisted upon him as an antique an ingenious Scottish paraphrase of &#145;Mary's Dream&#146;. Cromek was fooled and gives both versions.<br>
