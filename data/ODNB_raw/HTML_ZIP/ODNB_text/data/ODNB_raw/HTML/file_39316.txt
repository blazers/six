<span class="headword">Cobb,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1715&#150;1778), <span class="occ">cabinet-maker and upholsterer</span>, is presumably the person of that name put as apprentice in 1729 to Tim Money, a Norwich upholsterer  (Boyd MSS). The Norfolk connection is feasible on account of Cobb's bequeathing in 1778 the interest realized on &pound;20,000 (after his second wife's lifetime receiving of the same) to William Cobb, the grandson of William Cobb at Wallingford in Norfolk  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1044, fols. 257<i>r</i>&#150;258<i>r</i>). As apprentices were normally put to a trade at the age of fourteen, <i>c</i>.1715 seems a likely year for his birth, although nothing precise is known of his parentage or birth. Having come out of his apprenticeship about 1736 he may have continued to work for his master as a journeyman (that is, one who works in a business he does not own). Some chance then brought him in contact with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39348/', "William Vile (1714/15&#150;1767)")</script>, his partner for the next fourteen years, until Vile's retirement in 1764.<br>
<br>The partnership between Cobb and Vile was set up in London in 1751, in the New Street ward of St Martin-in-the-Fields, and was, seemingly, capitalized by the successful cabinet-maker William Hallett (1707&#150;1781). The rate books for 1751 show &#145;William Vile &amp; Co.&#146; with their patron, William Hallett, occupying the next-door premises  (Westminster city archives, MS, fol. 527). By 1755 Hallett's name has been excised in favour of John Cobb. The bank accounts of Vile and Cobb show monthly payments to Hallett (who used the same bank), particularly in the years 1758&#150;63 (Royal Bank of Scotland, Drummonds branch, London). On 31 March 1755 Cobb consolidated his position (although affection probably played a part) by marrying Sukey, daughter of Giles Grendey (1693&#150;1780), a successful London furniture maker with an extensive export business. The newspaper account of the marriage described Cobb as &#145;an eminent Timber Merchant&#146;  (<span class="italic">General Evening Post</span>). Cobb, as his will makes clear, married twice; his second wife was called Mary. The date of Sukey's death, and the date of the second marriage, are unknown. There seems little reason for Cobb's adoption of a singularly haughty character, other than the fact that with his partner he had been a cabinet-maker to the crown since 1761  (TNA: PRO, LC 5/57). J. T. Smith records how, presumably in the 1760s, Cobb in full dress &#145;of the most superb and costly kind strutted through his workshops giving orders to his men&#146;  (Smith, 2.243). Smith also relates how George III placed Cobb's name second to that of Vile through annoyance at his pomposity and imperious delegation of duties to his foreman, John Jenkins. Cobb was in royal service from 1761 to 1764, and after the retirement of his partner turned to the provision of superb marquetry furniture in the neo-classical style.<br>
<br>After Vile's retirement Cobb continued in business for a further fourteen years: the full range of his commissions was listed by G. Beard and C. Gilbert in their <span class="italic">Dictionary of English Furniture Makers</span> (1986). Mindful of the upsurge of styling in the neo-classical taste, introduced from Italy, and particularly by the architect Robert Adam (1728&#150;1792), Cobb worked in woods other than mahogany. In particular he used exotic veneers and floral marquetry. There was probably an urgent need to do so to counteract competition from other successful cabinet-makers working in this &#145;new&#146; mode, such as Mayhew and Ince (active from 1758 to the end of the century), and by the insistence of patrons wanting such pieces. An early example of this styling came in 1765 when Cobb supplied Robert Adam and his patron, George William, sixth earl of Coventry, with furniture including &#145;8 Mahogony Armd Chairs&#146; at a cost of &pound;30. They are after a drawing by Adam (Sir John Soane's Museum, London), and are thus an early essay in the revived &#145;antique&#146; taste. The chairs are still in the possession of the estate trustees. Cobb continued to provide a wide range of furniture although he made no provisions for funerals&#151;for many cabinet-makers undertaking was a profitable side-line. Seminal to the late work, however, is a series of commodes of superb quality which incorporate the elaborate veneering of curved surfaces and floral marquetry. A documented example is the inlaid commode and two satinwood vase stands supplied in 1772&#150;4 to Paul Methuen (priv. coll.). The commode was charged in 1772 at &pound;63 5<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>.; the vase stands were supplied two years later at an unknown cost  (Methuen archive, MS 1742, 8112, Wilts. &amp; Swindon HC). The side panels incorporate Methuen's arms with those of his wife, Catherine Cobb (seemingly no relative to the maker), and the sinuous ormolu corner mounts enhance the form. They are among Cobb's finest achievements.<br>
<br>Cobb's work after Vile's retirement gave him an increasing fortune. At his death in London, which occurred between 26 and 31 August 1778, he had a dwelling house in St Martin's Lane, a house at Highgate, a chariot, horses, and the sum of &pound;20,000 to &#145;support the name of Cobb&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1044, fols. 257<i>r</i>&#150;258<i>r</i>). A notice in 1783 recorded that he was &#145;formerly partner with the late Mr Hallett of Cannons&#146;, a fact well attested by the earlier financial arrangement  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). With his partner, William Vile, John Cobb was one of the most accomplished furniture makers active in the third quarter of the eighteenth century.<br>
