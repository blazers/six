<span class="headword">Waller, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1639&#150;1699), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the second, but first surviving, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28561/', "Sir William Waller (bap. 1598?, d. 1668)")</script>, parliamentarian army officer, and his second wife, Lady Anne Finch (<i>d</i>. 1651/2), daughter of Thomas Finch, first earl of Winchilsea. He was educated at the University of Leiden in 1647 and travelled abroad with a tutor in France in 1656, where he acquired a reputation as a vicious profligate. His father had closely supervised his strict presbyterian education, but William later went his own &#145;rebellious way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 3.240&#150;41), leaving the elder Waller fearful of William's influence upon his younger stepbrother. Under the father's will both sons were left in the hands of trustees, but William soon began to sell off his father's property. A number of customs posts that came his way, however, proved less profitable. In 1667 he married Catherine, daughter of Bussy Mansel of Briton Ferry, Glamorgan. He was at Utrecht during the Third Anglo-Dutch War and on his return to England he was targeted as a frequenter of conventicles. As a result a recommendation that Waller should be given the post of minister at Hamburg was ignored. Nevertheless, he was knighted in 1675.<br>
<br>It was during the period of the Popish Plot in 1678&#150;81 that Waller became prominent as a London JP. He was particularly noted for his anti-Catholic fervour as well as his actions to seize both Catholic priests and their goods. As one contemporary noted:<blockquote>
<div>God's Providence and Waller's studious care,<br>
</div>
<div>Hath laid the Bottom of their secrets bare.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">England's Remembrancer</span>)</blockquote>Waller swiftly established himself in the popular mind as a zealous justice, being often in the vanguard in searches for hidden priests by raiding their homes, as well as the Savoy and other regular Catholic haunts. He also made many conspicuous appearances in the satirical literature of the day, being described as one whose &#145;Argus Eyes, the Secret'st Corners spy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sir William Waller's Kindness</span>). In early February 1679 he seized some 1500 popish books and other material in Holborn. Three cartloads of popish goods were subsequently burnt on 11 February under his supervision in a public ceremony lasting from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. His anti-Catholicism also brought him into close contact with the great informers of the day and made him a number of enemies. In 1679 he was closely involved in uncovering Thomas Dangerfield's Meal-Tub Plot. Thomas Blood, with whom Waller came into conflict in 1680, claimed to have &#145;broke the neck&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 556) of Waller when the latter was removed from the bench in April for his overzealous pursuit of Blood and Edward Christian's plot to implicate the duke of Buckingham in the crime of sodomy. Nevertheless Waller continued to be involved in various underhand activities such as suborning witnesses and was a prominent member of the Green Ribbon Club.<br>
<br>Waller represented Westminster in the parliaments of 1679 and 1681. In March of the latter year he was prominent in the entrapment of the conspirator Edward Fitzharris, acting as a witness at Fitzharris's trial for high treason. In May 1681 Waller was arrested for debt and placed in the Fleet prison, but was soon released. With the reaction against plots, informers, and the whigs he fled abroad and was at Amsterdam to greet the earl of Shaftesbury on his arrival there in December 1682. He eventually settled at Bremen in Germany where he became a colonel of the city militia, although he was removed from this post in May 1684. Despite this other miscreants, including Sir Thomas Armstrong and Robert Ferguson, soon gathered around him and were given a warm welcome. English agents noted that Waller played the &#145;devill &hellip; and many more of that stamp &hellip; style [him] a second Cromwell&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 386). In 1685 he was made governor of L&uuml;neburg, given a regimental command, and established an English factory there. In the wake of the Williamite revolution of 1688 he returned to England, initially leading a regiment (that was soon disbanded), and continued his actions to seize Catholics, for which he had a warrant from William III in March 1689. Thereafter the new king &#145;did not seem inclin'd to do anything for&#146; him, and &#145;would not hear of [him as governor] for the Leeward Islands&#146;  (Foxcroft, 2.215, 224). His final years are obscure and he died in poverty on 18 July 1699.<br>
<br>Waller's genuinely held, although slightly unbalanced, anti-Catholicism permeated all of his actions. At the height of the Popish Plot he was never very scrupulous about his methods and was undoubtedly guilty of bullying, suborning, and intimidating many witnesses, as well as seizing their goods for his own benefit. As he plied his trade one contemporary noted that:<blockquote>
<div>You let them Plot, then shew their Priests a trick,<br>
</div>
<div>You catch the plotters in the very Nick.<br>
</div>
<div>Many by your Industry have been taken,<br>
</div>
<div>For fear of you, some have the land forsaken.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Sir William Waller's Kindness</span>)</blockquote>Scorned by his enemies for his short stature Waller seems to have delighted in his duties and, for a time, successfully strove to make himself as conspicuous as possible in the affair of the Popish Plot.<br>
