<span class="headword">Robertson, Sir  Charles Grant</span>  (1869&#150;1948), <span class="occ">historian and academic administrator</span>, was born at Naini Tal, India, on 22 June 1869, the younger son of John Grant Robertson, of the Bengal civil service, and his wife, Isabel Jane Grant, daughter of a minister in the western highlands. Educated at Highgate School and Hertford College, Oxford, of which he was a scholar and became an honorary fellow in 1921, Robertson won the Stanhope prize (1891), took first classes in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1892) and modern history (1893), and was elected in 1893 a fellow of All Souls College, a position he retained for the rest of his life, serving as domestic bursar (1897&#150;1920) and during the Second World War as acting domestic bursar. In 1899 he published a history of the college to which he always remained deeply attached.<br>
<br>Robertson was tutor in modern history at Exeter College (1895&#150;9) and at Magdalen College (1905&#150;20). An expert teacher of undergraduates, he was far from being an unworldly don. In the 1890s he contributed a series of dialogues and sketches to the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, which poked fun at &#145;bookworms and hearties, bluestockings and chaperons&#146;  (Hawgood, 353), and these were collected in <span class="italic">Voces academicae</span> (1898). Though he never married, he had a reputation for being a ladies' man. It was said that one female don, or &#145;VPFD&#146; (Very Proper Female Don), as Robertson would have called her, used to admonish her charges never to visit any male don alone, but always to go in pairs, and in the case of Charles Grant Robertson, to go in threes. He acted as history tutor to Edward, prince of Wales, at Magdalen (1912&#150;14), and for his services was appointed CVO in 1914.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Robertson's lecturing was noted for its breadth and vigour, wealth of illustration, and geographical knowledge (he published with J. G. Bartholomew a <span class="italic">Historical and Modern Atlas of the British Empire</span>, 1905, and a <span class="italic">Historical Atlas of Modern Europe</span>, 1915), while his interest in the arts, not excluding the cinema, lent variety to his celebrated powers of conversation and reminiscence. Robertson's loquaciousness was well known and J. A. Hawgood, later professor of history at Birmingham, recalled that during the viva for his doctoral thesis Robertson, one of his two examiners, &#145;asked nearly all the questions and &hellip; answered most of them before I could get in a word&#146;  (Hawgood, 350). Junior proctor in 1905&#150;6, and a member of the hebdomadal council (1911&#150;20), Robertson was in close contact with university affairs.<br>
<br>In 1920 Robertson succeeded Sir Oliver Lodge as principal of Birmingham University and served as its vice-chancellor from 1927 until his retirement in 1938. From this position he made himself largely responsible for organizing the (as yet) unofficial Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, over which for a time he presided. At Birmingham he drew city and university more closely together, and left his mark as a public-spirited academic administrator. He was a leading figure in the establishment of the Barber Trust and the foundation of the Barber chair and Institute of Fine Art; and he was chairman of the executive committee which brought into existence the new Birmingham Hospitals Centre, adjoining the university buildings at Edgbaston. As a classicist and a historian Robertson came from a different intellectual background from the distinguished scientist who was his predecessor at Birmingham, and in seeking to strengthen the humanities there he encountered some opposition. He nevertheless prevailed, giving special attention to library development, and his period as principal and vice-chancellor was widely judged a success. He surveyed the growth of the modern university system in <span class="italic">The British Universities</span>, first published in 1930 and revised in 1944, and received the honorary degree of LLD from the universities of Edinburgh (1925), Glasgow (1930), Bristol (1935), and Birmingham (1939), and of LittD from Sheffield (1936). He was knighted in 1928.<br>
<br>Robertson's reputation rests on his achievements as an academic administrator and as a teacher, rather than any original contribution to research. His talent as a historian lay in his ability to &#145;popularize without vulgarizing&#146; the subject  (Hawgood, 359) and his historical writings, notable for their sane judgement and grasp of essentials, are mainly on the political and constitutional history of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. His textbook of English history, <span class="italic">England under the Hanoverians</span> (1911), and his book of constitutional documents, <span class="italic">Select statutes, cases and documents to illustrate English constitutional history, 1660&#150;1832</span> (1904; new edn, 1935), quickly became standard works; at the end of his life he returned to the period in his <span class="italic">Chatham and the British Empire</span> (1946) and <span class="italic">Bolingbroke</span> (1947). His particular interest in modern Germany was displayed in <span class="italic">The Evolution of Prussia</span> (with J. A. R. Marriott, 1915; revised edn, 1946) and in his <span class="italic">Bismarck</span> (1918), probably his best book. Later, in a number of historical pamphlets, especially <span class="italic">Religion and the Totalitarian State</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">The Edict of Nantes and Freedom in the World of Today</span> (1939), his liberal views were voiced against the prevailing tendencies in central Europe. He emphasized the historian's duty to the public in his Creighton lecture, <span class="italic">History and Citizenship</span> (1928), and the same large spirit animated his presidency (1938&#150;42 and 1945) of the Historical Association.<br>
<br>Robertson died at his home, The Sheiling, Ashley, Ringwood, Hampshire, on 28 February 1948. If the austerity of his last years, when ailments increased, veiled the sprightly author of <span class="italic">Voces academicae</span>, or the romantic novelist who had written as Wymond Carey, nothing could obscure his &#145;wise and selfless judgement&#146; (as a biographer put it) or his helpfulness to younger scholars and teachers. At All Souls he made lifelong friendships with Bishop Henson and Archbishop Lang. A moderate Anglican, Robertson served as a member of the archbishops' commission on the relations of church and state which reported in 1935.<br>
