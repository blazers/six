<span class="headword">Nevill,  William</span>, first marquess of Abergavenny  (1826&#150;1915), <span class="occ">party manager</span>, was born on 16 September 1826 at Longford Hall, Shropshire, the eldest son and heir of William Nevill, the fourth earl of Abergavenny (<i>d</i>. 1868), of Eridge Castle, Frant, near Tunbridge Wells, and of Nevill Hall, Abergavenny, and Caroline, daughter of Ralph Leeke, of Longford Hall, Shropshire; he had one brother and three sisters. From his father's succession to the peerage in 1845 until his own succession in 1868, he was styled Viscount Nevill. He was educated at Eton College. In 1848 he married Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of Sir John Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone, second baronet, of Hackness Hall, Scarborough, with whom he had five sons and five daughters. In 1849 he was commissioned in the 2nd Life Guards.<br>
<br>After early years of conventional country and sporting pursuits Nevill developed a consuming interest in working to restore the fortunes of the Conservative Party as it struggled, during the leadership of Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli, to regain the confidence of the country after the split under Peel in 1846. Nevill never sought a Commons seat nor much figured in a public role in the Lords; he had no ambition to influence or participate in decisions of high policy. He remained consistently through his long life content to work in the background of politics as organizer, fund-raiser, adviser, and manager-activist for the Conservative cause in the constituencies. He took to heart Disraeli's point that the Conservative Party depended much more than the Liberal on a comprehensive and efficient system of organization. In this &#145;backroom&#146; sphere Nevill came to have an unrivalled reputation as the &#145;tory bloodhound&#146; for his assiduous application to electioneering and raising the money to fund it. He was instrumental in founding the Junior Carlton Club in 1864; he was one of the group which started the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> in 1866; he took over superintendence of the National Conservative Registration Association. He came to have a bond of friendship with and admiration for Disraeli, which was warmly reciprocated.<br>
<br>Nevill was primarily responsible for moving Markham Spofforth out of the party's firm of legal advisers, Messrs Baxter, Rose, Norton &amp; Co., to take over the party agency on the retirement of Philip Rose in 1859, and worked steadily with him until Spofforth was replaced by J. E. Gorst in 1870. With Gorst (party agent 1870&#150;77, 1880&#150;82), a rather prickly &#145;tory democrat&#146;, Abergavenny (as he had become) was never on easy terms; nor was he much at ease during G. C. T. Bartley's brief and troubled term (1883&#150;5). W. B. Skene (1877&#150;80) suited Abergavenny better, but it was not until the arrival at Central Office from Kent in 1885 of R. W. E. Middleton that the Conservative leaders found a principal agent who suited their requirements, and who collaborated smoothly with the concurrent chief whip, who had also &#145;come under Lord Abergavenny's eye&#146;, Aretas Akers-Douglas.<br>
<br>Abergavenny's most important political insight was to see that the party &#145;out of doors&#146; would become of immensely greater consequence with the semi-democratic &#145;occupier&#146; borough franchise of the second <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1867. Despite a stubborn reluctance on Disraeli's part, Abergavenny pushed through the arrangements leading to the inauguration in November 1867 of the Conservative National Union, by which the multifarious Conservative local associations and societies were gathered together in permanent institutional form. It is altogether characteristic of Abergavenny's political covertness that Disraeli&#151;who ruthlessly snubbed that inauguration&#151;should none the less be credited with it as the genius of &#145;popular toryism&#146;. Abergavenny followed through the logic of assimilating the provincial Conservative &eacute;lites by founding in 1883 the Constitutional Club, which effectively in 1887 incorporated the Beaconsfield Club of 1879. He was by this time virtual manager of both the Carlton and Junior Carlton clubs.<br>
<br>Abergavenny settled into a station of singular prestige in the innermost Conservative councils: the &#145;Grand Panjandrum&#146;; the &#145;electioneering Warwick&#146;, <i>grand seigneur</i> of the &#145;Kent gang&#146; of party managers. He was principal trustee of the party fund; he was supreme promoter and vetter of patronage; he greatly assisted Lord Salisbury and Lord Randolph Churchill to come to terms in 1884. He was rewarded by Disraeli with a marquessate (of Abergavenny) in 1876 and by Salisbury with a Garter in 1886. He was lord lieutenant of Sussex from 1892 to 1905, and honorary colonel of the Kent and Sussex yeomanry regiments.<br>
<br>An imposing yet genial aristocratic figure, Abergavenny made Eridge Castle a centre famed for party hospitality. He features in the various memoirs of his cousin by marriage, Lady Dorothy Nevill. After 1905 ill health obliged him to retire from active party service and he died at Eridge on 12 December 1915, in his ninetieth year, and was buried in the family vault in the church at Eridge Green. <span class="italic">The Times</span> marked his death as worthy of a news item in its own right, not a mere obituary.<br>
