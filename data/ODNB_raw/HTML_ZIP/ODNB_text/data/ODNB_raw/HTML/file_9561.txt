<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  James  fitz Maurice</span>, <i>de jure</i> twelfth earl of Desmond  (<em>d.</em> 1540), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son of Maurice fitz Thomas Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1529), only son and heir apparent of Thomas Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Desmond (<i>d</i>. 1534); his mother was Joan, daughter of John fitz Maurice FitzGibbon, the white knight. His grandfather Thomas had succeeded as earl, aged about seventy-five, against a background of internecine warfare among the Desmonds, and spent the greater part of his remaining years in an attempt to ensure James's succession. In May 1532 Thomas informed Henry VIII that he could not send James to England, as he had promised in his submission, as he feared for his safety, believing that it was best for James to remain in Munster. When Thomas died in 1534 James's right to succeed was disputed by Sir John of Desmond, <i>de facto</i> twelfth earl of Desmond, and Sir John's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9560/', "James fitz John Fitzgerald, later thirteenth earl (d. 1558)")</script>, on account of the doubts over his parents' marriage&#151;Maurice and Joan were first cousins, having a common grandmother, and having married without papal dispensation, their marriage was considered invalid by the majority of the Geraldines. James fitz Maurice was therefore illegitimate, and consequently barred from the succession, leaving Sir John as the rightful heir and <i>de facto</i> earl.<br>
<br>James fitz Maurice, described as a young man who spoke very good English, was supported in his bid for the earldom by his father-in-law Cormac &Oacute;g Laidhir MacCarthy, lord of Muskerry. James was in Ireland until 1535. The following year he was in England, where he remained until 1539. During that time there were numerous calls to have him sent back to Ireland in order to help defeat James, thirteenth earl of Desmond, both from agents of Piers Butler, eighth earl of Ormond, and from the council of Ireland. It was possibly at this time that fitz Maurice served as page to Henry VIII, although this is uncertain. In 1539 he returned to Ireland, receiving &pound;40 from the king in July for his journey home. In November to December 1539 Lord Deputy Leonard Grey and James Butler, ninth earl of Ormond, marched through Munster and secured the territories of Imokilly and Kerrycurrihy in co. Cork for James. This success was not followed up, however, and James's possession of his lands was restricted to these areas in eastern co. Cork.<br>
<br>At an unknown time before April 1535 James married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1548), daughter of Cormac &Oacute;g Laidhir MacCarthy, lord of Muskerry, with whom he had a daughter, Judith (<i>d</i>. 1565). His widow would subsequently marry Daniel O'Sullivan More. James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald was killed by Maurice an T&oacute;ite&aacute;n (Maurice of the Burnings), brother of James, thirteenth earl, near Youghal, co. Cork, on 19 March 1540, and was buried in Youghal. His lack of support among the Desmond Geraldines had proved fatal for his claim to the earldom of Desmond.<br>
