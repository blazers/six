<span class="headword">MacKenzie,  Alister <span class="st"> [Alexander]</span></span>  (1870&#150;1934), <span class="occ">golf course architect and medical practitioner</span>, was born at The Orchard, Normanton, near Leeds, on 30 August 1870, the second of six children of Dr William Scobie MacKenzie (<i>c</i>.1820&#150;1917), medical practitioner, and his wife, Mary Jane Smith. The family came from Lochinver, Sutherland, where Dr William's father, Alexander (Meal Mhor), managed the duke of Sutherland's Assynt estates. The Scottish connection remained strong and, though baptized Alexander, MacKenzie adopted the Gaelic form Alister.<br>
<br>After schooling, probably at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, MacKenzie went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1888, intending to study medicine, probably under paternal pressure. He obtained his BA in 1891, with a third in the natural sciences tripos. After moving to Leeds medical school, he showed his unconventionality by extending his undergraduate career to seventeen years. In 1895 he obtained the MRCS and LRCP, which permitted him to practise medicine, but he took only desultory advantage of this. He obtained the Cambridge MB, BCh, in 1897 but in 1905 he was still registered as a Leeds undergraduate and concluded his aimless degree collecting with the Leeds MB, ChB. That year he married Edith Wedderburn; it was a childless union which ended in divorce in 1929.<br>
<br>MacKenzie served in the South African War as &#145;civil surgeon&#146; with the Somerset light infantry, but became more interested in the way that the Boers repeatedly confused the British by intelligent camouflage than he was in any medical matters. On returning to Leeds to study and, occasionally, to practise medicine he started experimenting with golf course design, an activity with many similarities to camouflaging. In August 1914 he won a <span class="italic">Country Life</span> competition to design a hole for a course on Long Island, New York. A nascent career was, however, stalled almost immediately by the outbreak of the First World War.<br>
<br>As a territorial major, MacKenzie served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Flanders from the outset, but again it was camouflage rather than medicine which interested him. In <span class="italic">Country Life</span> (6 March 1915) an article on military entrenchments gave MacKenzie's views on camouflage, criticizing the officers responsible. Court-martial might have resulted; instead he was transferred to the engineers to work on camouflage, albeit at the reduced rank of lieutenant. This marked the end of his transient medical career, though he continued to enjoy using the prefix Dr.<br>
<br>From 1918 MacKenzie's true career, golf course design, blossomed. He was convinced of the enormous medical, social, and cultural benefits of golf, and was an early champion of municipal golf in England: in his book <span class="italic">Golf Architecture</span> (1920) he wrote that municipal golf courses &#145;would help enormously in increasing the health, the virility, and the prosperity of the nation, and would do much to counteract discontent and Bolshevism&#146;  (p. 119). Contracts came from both sides of the Atlantic and the balance of his work gradually shifted to America. Much of it was done in co-operation with his younger brother Charles, who supervised construction. In 1926 MacKenzie made a remarkably productive trip to Australia, where he left his mark with many distinguished courses, none more so than Royal Melbourne.<br>
<br>In 1929 MacKenzie moved permanently to California and in 1930 he married Hilda (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Sykes), widow of Edgar Haddock. They had been friends as students and she brought him two stepsons. His remaining years combined great happiness and achievement. They established a home on the edge of Pasatiempo, one of his own courses. As with Sir Harry Lauder, then popular in American music-halls, American life suited him and he it. Kilted, they flaunted their Scottishness and shared a penchant for pawky but rather feeble jokes.<br>
<br>MacKenzie designed over 100 new courses in all, the majority in California, including the wonderful links at Cypress Point on the Monterey peninsula, which opened in August 1928. It was the latter which brought MacKenzie's work to the attention of Robert Tyre (Bobby) Jones, the greatest of all amateur golfers and controller of a new development at Augusta, Georgia. Jones contracted MacKenzie to design the course, and the undulating Augusta site, which had been established a century earlier as a private estate with many and varied trees and shrubs, gave MacKenzie a unique opportunity to combine the preservation and creation of beauty&#151;his benchmark in all his architectural work.<br>
<br>MacKenzie died from coronary thrombosis at his home, 70 Hollins Drive, Pasatiempo, on 6 January 1934, before the first playing of what would come to be called the masters' championship over the US national course at Augusta. His second wife survived him. He wished to be buried in the family grave at Nedd, near Lochinver, but circumstances precluded this and his ashes were scattered over Pasatiempo course. His name is now on the family stone. Two publications appeared posthumously, <span class="italic">Military Engineer</span> (on camouflage) and <span class="italic">The Spirit of St Andrews</span> (on golf).<br>
<br>How great was MacKenzie's achievement? He has been compared to Holbein, to Rembrandt, and to Picasso but perhaps a more apt and appropriate comparison is with another artist of the landscape, Capability Brown. As golf has developed, so has an appreciation of the unique blend of aesthetic, technical, and commercial sensibilities embodied by the best course designers, of whom there has been none greater than Dr Alister MacKenzie.<br>
