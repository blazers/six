<span class="headword">Sutton,  Katherine</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1630&#150;1663), <span class="occ">prophetess</span>, lived in England during her early life and subsequently emigrated to the Netherlands about 1659. Although nothing of her parents or of her origins is known, a broad outline of Sutton's life can be gathered from her spiritual autobiography, <span class="italic">A Christian Womans Experiences of the Glorious Working of God's Free Grace</span> (published in Rotterdam in 1663).<br>
<br>Sutton was a governess by profession, and in her youth she was drawn &#145;into a darck corner of the land&#146; inhabited by &#145;many Papists&#146;, possibly Lancashire  (Sutton, 2). She then married &#145;a man that was much in practical duties&#146; with whom she had a number of children, at least two of which died prematurely  (ibid., 3, 5&#150;6, 10).<br>
<br>Sutton's life was marked both by intense religious experience and by robust journeying. She recalls marching &#145;many miles&#146; through &#145;all weathers&#146; to attend worthy sermons and, in her quest to join a suitable congregation, she relocated with her family at least once in England before travelling twice overseas. The first journey abroad may have been prompted by Archbishop Laud's reforms of church practices in the early 1630s: Sutton resolved to separate from &#145;such a way of worship&#146; after &#145;Altars were reared up&#146;, following which &#145;the Lord carried mee over the Sea&#146;, she states, &#145;where I did injoy further and fuller communion with himself in his ordinances&#146;  (Sutton, 6&#150;7, 10). By the late 1650s she had set sail for the Netherlands, suffering a shipwreck in which her writings (recalling &#145;thirty years experiences&#146;) were lost  (ibid., 21&#150;2).<br>
<br>The most remarkable aspect of Sutton's life lies in her gift for &#145;spiritual singing&#146;, first experienced while out walking in February 1655 (Sutton, 13&#150;14; Smith, 5&#150;6, 332&#150;3). Filled with the spirit, Sutton suddenly found herself able to sing extempore verse prophecies predicting England's imminent destruction and claiming &#145;that God would afflict that nation&#146; with war and other calamities for its &#145;sins&#146;. At one point, Sutton &#145;had an opportunity to declare this to some that then were in high places&#146;: after disregarding her counsel, &#145;they were soon brought down and laid low&#146;  (Sutton, 14&#150;16). Occurrences of such singing apparently intensified around 1658, immediately before Sutton's removal to the Netherlands. However, not all her songs prophesied national doom. Many of the inspired hymns were devotional in nature, as are those collected at the end of her account.<br>
<br>Doctrinally, Sutton's faith was broadly Calvinist or Reformed, asserting foremost that salvation is by &#145;grace&#146; and not &#145;by workes of righteousness&#146; or &#145;of our selves&#146;  (Sutton, 33). Denominationally, it seems that Sutton was a Baptist, having rejected early on &#145;the evil and falseness&#146; of paedobaptist &#145;Christening&#146; and being later &#145;baptized together&#146; with other adult members of her church  (Sutton, 7, 12). More specifically, she may have been associated with English Particular Baptists, as <span class="italic">A Christian Womans Experiences</span> includes a laudatory preface by the renowned Particular Baptist divine Hanserd Knollys.<br>
