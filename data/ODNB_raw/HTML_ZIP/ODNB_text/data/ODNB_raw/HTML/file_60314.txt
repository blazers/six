<span class="headword">Macvicar,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1795&#150;1858/9), <span class="occ">textile merchant and civic leader</span>, is a figure about whom nothing is known before his marriage to Isabella Burn (<i>b</i>. 1799), in January 1821 at South Leith, Midlothian. He remains strangely elusive to the historian, though an important figure in Britain's early nineteenth-century trade with China. For more than anyone, Macvicar promoted and inspired the export of cotton products to exploit the demise of the East India Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1833. He constituted a vital nexus in the trade's supporting infrastructure, providing a personal link and a measure of co-ordination between the disparate worlds of the Canton (Guangzhou) merchant, the Lancashire manufacturer, and the political lobby.<br>
<br>At first dependent on the agency services provided by the older houses in the Far East, Macvicar gradually took all stages of the trade into his own hands. Between 1823 and 1829 John Macvicar &amp; Co., &#145;agents general and commercial&#146;, were located at 4 Barges Yard, Bucklersbury, London, with interests as far afield as Havana. An exploratory visit to the East about 1830 revealed a potential demand for British cotton piece-goods in spite of increasing American competition from the looms of Lowell, Massachusetts. In addition to a partnership with his brother-in-law, David Burn, in Bombay, agency agreements were sealed with Purvis &amp; Co. in Singapore, Anderson and Wardrop in Penang, and Jardines in Canton.<br>
<br>Frustration with Jardines and their apparent sluggishness caused ill-feeling on both sides in the mid-1830s. Hardly their pawn, as once suggested, Macvicar had his own objectives to secure and by 1838 Macvicar &amp; Co. itself was established in Canton, acting as agent for the Bombay Commercial Insurance Society. Surviving the First Opium War (1839&#150;42) Macvicars was still in business at the &#145;new English factory&#146; in Canton in 1848, having participated in the foundation of Hong Kong by purchasing lots in the first land sale of 1841.<br>
<br>Macvicar's interests lay decidedly with the home manufacturer, and from the early 1830s he was resident in Manchester at 48 Mosley Street. As a partner in the Manchester calico-printing firm of Butterworth and Brooks, and with his links through John Brooks to the Blackburn bankers Cunliffe Brooks &amp; Co., he was well-connected in Lancastrian industrial circles; this attribute was invaluable in Macvicar's successful promotion of the Union Bank of Manchester, of which he had been a founder director in 1836. Cotton was Manchester's lifeblood, and, as continental European and American manufacturing gathered pace, British producers anxiously eyed new outlets to replace those disappearing. However, Macvicar and his associate Samuel Gregson probably over-promoted the potential of China and fostered exaggerated expectations among manufacturers who included Horrocks of Preston, producers of a celebrated cambric much in vogue in Canton.<br>
<br>Macvicar's position as a director and vice-president of the Manchester chamber of commerce, together with his business link with Gregson, later a chairman of the East India and China Association, established him as the leading advocate of the local China interest. As the prime mover behind the chamber of commerce's memorial of February 1836 on the &#145;unprotected state of trade with China&#146;, he can be credited with being the first to throw the weight of British manufacturing behind the lobby to encourage the British government to adopt a coercive or &#145;forward policy&#146; towards China. Macvicar's credibility as a spokesman was accepted at the highest levels and in October 1839, accompanied by a Mr Garnett of Clitheroe, he briefed Palmerston on the concerns of the manufacturers as war with China loomed.<br>
<br>As both Jardines and Gregson discovered to their cost, Macvicar was a difficult man to handle. Yet he was not totally self-interested. He took his civic responsibilities seriously at a time when the town of Manchester was witnessing both administrative change and social stress. His record as borough reeve (or chief officer) in 1835&#150;6 was sufficiently impressive to warrant further service, following the introduction of a borough council, as alderman for the Oxford ward between 1838 and 1841 (when he was an exact contemporary of Richard Cobden), and as a justice of the borough up to 1852. Together with his support of the Royal Manchester Institution as an annual governor, this at least provides a glimmer of altruism. It is not known whether Macvicar had children. His death is recorded in the minutes of the annual general meeting of 27 July 1859 of the Union Bank of Manchester.<br>
