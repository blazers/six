<span class="headword">Watson,  John Steven</span>  (1916&#150;1986), <span class="occ">historian and academic administrator</span>, was born on 20 March 1916 at 20 Newton Terrace, Hebburn-on-Tyne, co. Durham, the only son of George Watson, naval architect, and his wife, Elizabeth Laybourn Gall. At the age of seven after his parents had moved to Finchley, Middlesex, he lost his right leg in a street accident, a handicap which even as a schoolboy he learned to overcome and exploit. Exhorted by a strong, ambitious mother, he proved a lively and talented pupil at Merchant Taylors' School, London (1929&#150;35), from where he went as Andrews scholar to St John's College, Oxford. Despite missing a year through illness he took a first class in modern history at the age of twenty-three and in 1939 was elected Harmsworth senior scholar at Merton College. On 9 January 1942 he married Heba Sylvia de Cordoba (<i>b</i>. 1918), the daughter of Ernest Arthur Newberry, with whom he had two sons. In the same year he became temporary civil servant in the Ministry of Fuel and Power, acting as private secretary to successive ministers, including Emanuel Shinwell.<br>
<br>Watson returned to Oxford in 1945 as student and tutor at Christ Church. He was popular both with his colleagues, who valued his shrewd judgement (he was censor from 1955 to 1961), and with his pupils, who appreciated his stimulating teaching and personal interest. An ambitious man of tireless energy and mildly socialist views, he was active in Oxford Labour Party politics, even becoming an (unsuccessful) candidate for the city council. He was one of the first Oxford academics to enter broadcasting, writing scripts and speaking on radio and television. His growing reputation led to his inclusion by Lord Franks on the commission of inquiry (1964&#150;6) into the university.<br>
<br>Though his postgraduate research on the speakership of the House of Commons never came to fruition, the two-volume work Watson edited in collaboration with his former St John's tutor, W. C. Costin, <span class="italic">The Law and Working of the Constitution, 1660&#150;1914</span> (1952), was a fresh and imaginative collection of constitutional documents, lacking only the benefit of an editorial commentary. His main piece of historical writing was <span class="italic">The Reign of George III</span> (1960), an outstanding volume in the <span class="italic">Oxford History of England</span>, the product of wide reading and independent judgement. His 1968 Wiles lectures at the Queen's University, Belfast, &#145;The rise of party politics in England and America&#146;, did not prove satisfactory, however, and he always hoped to revise them before publication.<br>
<br>Watson's elevation as principal of St Andrews University in 1966 surprised his Christ Church colleagues, who assumed it owed much to his friendship with Harold Wilson and other members of the Labour government. There was a certain resentment at St Andrews, which had not been consulted or even forewarned; it was a tribute to his geniality and tact that he soon overcame that initial disadvantage. A politician by temperament rather than an administrator and unencumbered by previous St Andrews connections, he was admirably qualified to preside over the separation from Dundee, which was the first test of the new regime. Unsympathetic to the Scottish professorial tradition, he promoted a more egalitarian system which effectively detached the holders of established chairs from the leadership and administration of their departments. His other concerns were for the rapid expansion of the truncated university and a widening of its international links. An elaborate appeals campaign to strengthen the university's finances did not fulfil all his expectations but gave him the opportunity to travel extensively as a St Andrews ambassador, especially in the United States. Though slow to shed his ingrained Oxford and London predilections, he nevertheless became a loyal advocate of his adopted university. At St Andrews he was a well-liked and accessible figure, despite his difficulties in fixing on a congenial residence. His habitual unpunctuality and cavalier attitude to paperwork sometimes disconcerted colleagues and officials but he was always adroit in seizing the main points of an agenda and guiding committees to a conclusion. He was not without personal partialities and could be resentful of opposition; but his animosity seldom lasted. His wit was often mischievous, rarely malicious. To those who went to him for assistance he was invariably responsive and sometimes greatly helpful.<br>
<br>A large, untidy man of impressive appearance and much charm, Watson enjoyed being the centre of attention and relished the prestige and perquisites of his position. In his cheerful, worldly acceptance of what life offered him, he resembled the eighteenth-century aristocratic politicians about whom he wrote so perceptively. Essentially he was a frustrated man of action whom early circumstances had diverted into an academic life, and he was always ready to take on a wide range of public activities beyond the conventional duties of his office. Only in his later years, when his physical energy was sapped by disease and his absences from St Andrews became more frequent, did his popularity and effectiveness decline. Following a serious operation for cancer of the oesophagus in the spring of 1986 he died in the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, London, on 12 June 1986, a few months before he was due to retire.<br>
