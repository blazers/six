<span class="headword">Tattam,  Henry</span>  (1788&#150;1868), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Coptic scholar</span>, was born on 28 December 1788 at Church Farm, North Marston, Buckinghamshire, the youngest child of John Tattam (<i>b</i>. 1740?), a yeoman farmer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gurney (<i>b</i>. 1743?). He was tutored privately, by the Revd William Pinnock, incumbent of North Marston, who eventually encouraged him to enter the priesthood. After ordination as priest on 27 June 1819 he held curacies at Hinderclay in Suffolk (1819&#150;21) and at Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, before taking up an appointment as chaplain to the Episcopal church in Amsterdam. Through the influence of his elder brother, an inspector-general of customs, he was presented to the rectory of St Cuthbert's, Bedford, by the lord chancellor on 13 August 1822. He was admitted as a sizar of Christ's College, Cambridge, on 18 March 1823, but never graduated. He married Eliza Ann Platt, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nash (1789/90&#150;1855), widow of William Platt, at St Cuthbert's on 18 October 1830; they had no children.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1831 Tattam was presented to the rectory of Great Woolstone, Buckinghamshire, by his friend and patron the eccentric miser John Camden Neild, about whom he published a memoir in 1852. He held his benefices until 1849, during which time both churches were rebuilt&#151;Great Woolstone in 1832&#150;3 and St Cuthbert's in 1847&#151;and a new parsonage was built at Bedford in 1843. From 1845 to 1866 Tattam was archdeacon of Bedford, but he was non-resident for much of this time as in 1849 he was presented by the crown to the living of Stanford Rivers, Essex, where he spent the rest of his life. From 1853 to 1868 he was also a chaplain-in-ordinary to the queen. In later life he took a greater interest in his studies than in his ecclesiastical duties, and as a non-resident archdeacon he lacked the commitment needed at a time of major change in the church. He also became involved in a public controversy over the dismissal of a curate, the Revd Montagu Sparrow, at Stanford Rivers, in 1858.<br>
<br>Tattam's circle of friends included Dr John Lee of Hartwell, Joseph Bosworth, and George Lipscomb. He was a founder member of the Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire archaeological societies. His theological and philological interests led to an extensive <i>oeuvre</i> of published works, beginning with his <span class="italic">Helps for Devotion</span> (1825, reissued in 1862). He was the author of several works in Coptic and English, Latin, or Arabic, including editions of the gospels (1829), the book of <span class="roman">Job</span> (1846), the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (1847), and the apostolic constitutions (1848). His <span class="italic">Compendious Grammar of the Egyptian Language</span> was published in three parts in 1830. A second edition appeared in 1863. In 1835 he compiled a Coptic-Latin dictionary. Accompanied by his stepdaughter, Eliza Platt (1816&#150;1877), who wrote a privately printed (2 vols., 1841) account of their tour, Tattam first visited Egypt and the Holy Land in 1838&#150;9; he returned in 1842. On these visits he met the patriarch and secured a number of important Coptic and Syriac manuscripts for the British Library. He also published <span class="italic">A Defence of the Church of England Against the Attacks of a Roman Catholic Priest</span> (1843) and left manuscript histories of the parishes of St Cuthbert's, Bedford, and of Biddenham.<br>
<br>A diffident and modest man who was reluctant to take credit for his works, Tattam was held in high regard both for his pastoral work and preaching and for his scholarly achievements. His academic accomplishments were recognized in later life by numerous honours. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1835, and he received the degree of DD from the archbishop of Canterbury. He was also given the honorary degrees of LLD from Trinity College, Dublin, DD from G&ouml;ttingen, and DPhil from Leiden. He died on 8 January 1868 at the rectory, Stanford Rivers, and was buried on the 14th in Stanford Rivers, where he is commemorated by a small brass plate in the church chancel.<br>
