<span class="headword">Early,  Charles</span>  (1824&#150;1912), <span class="occ">blanket manufacturer</span>, was born on 29 December 1824 at West End, Witney, Oxfordshire, the eighth child and youngest son in the family of four sons and five daughters of John Early (1783&#150;1862), blanket maker, and his wife, Elizabeth (Betsy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Waine (1782&#150;1864). He was sent away to boarding-school in Oxford at a young age, before being apprenticed to his father to learn blanket weaving in 1839, the last apprentice bound with the Witney Company of Blanket Weavers. After finishing his apprenticeship he went to London to work for his uncle, Thomas Early, who had a clothing business. There he met, and in 1848 married, Sarah (1824&#150;1906), daughter of John Vanner of Stamford Hill, Stoke Newington. John Vanner was one of the founders of the City Bank and the Star Life Insurance Company and was descended from Huguenot silk weavers in Spitalfields. They had two sons, who became partners in the family firm, and one daughter.<br>
<br>Shortly after his marriage Charles Early returned to Witney to take charge of the family business, John Early &amp; Co., which was in difficulties, and in 1851 one of their patterned blankets won a bronze medal at the Great Exhibition. His father took him into partnership in 1851, the firm becoming John and Charles Early &amp; Co., one of several blanket-manufacturing firms in Witney owned by members of the Early family. There had been weaving in Witney since before the Norman conquest, and a flourishing blanket-making industry had developed along the River Windrush, using wool from Cotswold sheep. The founder of the firm, Thomas Early (1655&#150;1733), was the first master of the Blanket Company between 1711 and 1712. A cottage industry in the eighteenth century, blanket making was moving into mills by the early nineteenth century. The introduction of Kay's &#145;fly shuttle&#146; in Witney in the early 1800s meant that only one weaver was needed to work the hand loom, and by 1838 John Early &amp; Co. employed seventy weavers, working in two mills a mile apart.<br>
<br>Following John Early's death in 1862 the firm became Charles Early &amp; Co. in 1864. Charles Early continued the firm's expansion and modernization, always keeping abreast of the latest innovations. He had already installed his first self-acting spinning mule at New Mill in 1853, and from 1860 onwards he introduced power looms at Witney Mill. He built a large new warehouse at Newland, where he lived and had his office, in 1881&#150;2, and by the end of the century he owned three mills and had taken over Edward Early &amp; Son, concentrating the blanket manufacturing at Witney Mill. He remained head of the firm until 1910, when it became a private limited company, with his elder son, Charles William Early, as chairman, and he continued to play a part in the business until early in 1911.<br>
<br>Charles Early was one of the blanket manufacturers who brought a successful legal action in 1908&#150;9, limiting the description &#145;Witney blankets&#146; to blankets made in Witney, so that rival blankets made in the West Riding of Yorkshire could no longer be called &#145;Witney&#146; blankets. By then Witney blankets were famous: a Witney blanket was soft and loosely woven, containing mainly merino wool.<br>
<br>A Wesleyan Methodist, Early became a local preacher in 1848, and he preached on the Witney circuit for the rest of his life; he also held all the offices open to laymen in the Wesleyan church. He was a member of the first Wesleyan conference open to lay representatives, in 1878. A teetotaller and temperance reformer, he managed to turn the New Inn in Witney into a temperance hotel. Although a JP from 1890, Early did not take much part in public life in Witney, but he was one of the promoters and first directors of the Witney Railway Company, later taken over by the Great Western Railway Company.<br>
<br>Charles Early died on 17 May 1912 at his home, Newland House, Harcourt Street, Witney. He was buried at Witney cemetery on 21 May. A new organ for the Wesleyan church in Witney was donated by the family in his memory in 1919.<br>
