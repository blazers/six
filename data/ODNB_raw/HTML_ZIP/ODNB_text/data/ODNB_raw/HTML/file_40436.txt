<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Everard,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1602?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1651), <span class="occ">Digger</span>, probably came from Reading. A William Everard was baptized on 9 May 1602 in the parish of St Giles, Reading, as William Evered. It appears that aged fourteen this William Everard was apprenticed on 14 August 1616 to Robert Miller of the Merchant Taylors' Company, London, for the term of eight years; his name appears in the apprentice binding book as William Everad, son of William Everad, yeoman of Reading, Berkshire. It does not appear that this William Everard completed his term of apprenticeship, though it is noteworthy that Everard's future associate Gerrard Winstanley was a freeman of the Merchant Taylors'. It may be assumed that William Everard's family was poor for no one with the name Everard was assessed in the borough of Reading for a parliamentary subsidy between 1625 and 1641. On 20 February 1642 &#145;William Everet&#146; took the protestation oath in St Lawrence, Reading&#151;a parish where John Pordage (1607&#150;1681) was to become successively curate and vicar. In the early months of 1643 William Everard seems to have been acting as a parliamentarian spy for Sir Samuel Luke, scouting mainly in the Berkshire and Oxfordshire area. Perhaps he was captured on one of these sorties, for William Everard is not heard of again until May 1647, when his name appears as an ensign on a petition voicing the grievances of the army under the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax. Implicated in a plot to kill Charles I and subsequently detained at Windsor in the marshall-general's custody, William Everard was one of several men who in December 1647, while awaiting court martial, petitioned Fairfax against the injustice of their imprisonment. Some time afterwards Everard was cashiered from the army.<br>
<br>At an unknown date, but probably between December 1647 and March 1649, Everard visited the Baptist Samuel Fisher at his house in Lydd, Kent. Fisher recalled that in accordance with <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 2:17 Everard had adopted a new spiritual name: &#145;Chamberlin&#146;. This was apparently because Everard claimed to reside &#145;in the secret chambers of the most high&#146; and accords with another reference to him as &#145;<i>Chamberlain the</i> Redding <i>man</i>&#146;. Fisher had recently renounced infant baptism and &#145;received real baptism&#146;. But Everard, formerly a Baptist himself and &#145;pretending that he was immediately sent from God&#146;, urged Fisher to relinquish believer's baptism as well. Fisher, however, remained unconvinced, mocking Everard's &#145;strange&#146; ecstasies, &#145;uncouth deportment&#146;, &#145;blasphemous pratings&#146;, and presumptuousness, likening him to one of Satan's archangels of darkness  (Samuel Fisher, <span class="italic">Baby-Baptism Meer Babism</span>, 1653, 304).<br>
<br>In 1648, after spending the night in Kingston, Surrey, William Everard was imprisoned by the bailiffs of the town, allegedly at the instigation of &#145;Ministers, and some common people&#146;. Everard's companion, Gerrard Winstanley, defended him in a work entitled <span class="italic">Truth Lifting up its Head above Scandals</span> (the preface to the reader is dated 16 October 1648). According to Winstanley, &#145;the Redding man, called after the flesh, William Everard&#146; had reportedly held blasphemous opinions &#145;as to deny God, and Christ, and Scriptures, and prayer&#146;. Winstanley declared Everard and himself innocent of these slanders  (<span class="italic">Works of Gerrard Winstanley</span>, 103). Everard was soon the cause of scandal again. On 6 March 1649 he was bound by recognizance to appear at the Middlesex sessions of the peace. There he was charged with interrupting a church service at Staines in a threatening manner, shaking a hedging bill (a long-handled agricultural tool for cutting hedges) at the minister and shouting &#145;come down thou sonne of perdition come down&#146;. Two men stood bail for Everard, Henry Snelling of Walton and John Barker of Cobham, who became a Digger  (LMA, MJ/SR 1025/60).<br>
<br>Everard may also have been involved in a dramatic incident at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, about mid-February 1649, when six soldiers reportedly entered the church after evening service, one holding a lantern with a candle burning in it and four unlit candles. Prevented from going up into the pulpit and then speaking in the church, the lantern bearer went into the churchyard where he revealed to his auditors that he had received a vision and divine command to deliver God's message. This consisted of five lights, corresponding to the five candles: that the Sabbath was abolished as an unnecessary Jewish ceremonial law; that tithes were abolished for the same reason; that ministers were abolished as &#145;<i>Antichristian</i>&#146; and now replaced by Christ's Saints whom he enlightened with &#145;<i>Revelations, and Inspirations</i>&#146;; that magistrates were abolished, being redundant now that Christ had &#145;<i>erected the Kingdom of Saints upon earth</i>&#146;; and that the <span class="roman">Old and New Testaments</span> were abolished because Christ had now arrived in glory, imparting &#145;<i>a fuller measure of his Spirit to his Saints</i>&#146; than the scriptures. On delivering the message the soldier set fire to his <span class="roman">Bible</span>  (Clement Walker, <span class="italic">Anarchia Anglicana</span>, 1649, 152&#150;3). If Everard had already been cashiered, then identifying him as this unnamed soldier is problematic, unless he retained his uniform. Even so, it must be emphasized that the abolition of the Sabbath, tithes, and ministers&#151;together with anti-scripturism&#151;were all theological positions characteristically if not exclusively maintained, with varying degrees of subtlety, by several General Baptists.<br>
<br>In April 1649 Everard attained even greater notoriety. On either Sunday 1 or 8 April, together with four others, all described as living at Cobham, he went to St George's Hill in Walton-on-Thames and began digging the earth. The men sowed the ground with parsnips, carrots, and beans, returning the next day in increased numbers. The following day they burned at least forty roods of heath, which was considered &#145;a very great prejudice&#146; to the town. By the end of the week between twenty and thirty people were reportedly labouring the entire day at digging  (Firth, 2.210, 210&#150;11). It was said that they intended to plough up the ground and sow it with seed corn. Furthermore, they apparently threatened to pull down and level all park pales and &#145;lay all open&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perfect Occurences</span>, no. 120, 13&#150;20 April 1649, 450), thereby provoking fears of an anti-enclosure riot (a familiar form of agrarian protest). Everard and Winstanley were the acknowledged leaders of these &#145;new Levellers&#146; or &#145;diggers&#146;. It was said of Everard that he &#145;is no other then a madd man&#146; and that he &#145;termeth himself a prophett&#146;  (Firth, 2.212, 210). Indeed, Everard had justified the new communal experiment with a vision bidding him &#145;Arise and dig, and plow the Earth and receive the fruits thereof&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kingdomes Weekly Intelligencer</span>, no. 308, 17&#150;24 April 1649, 1334), while Winstanley declared that during a trance he had heard &#145;these words, <i>Worke together. Eat bread together</i>&#146;. St George's Hill was revealed as the place where, by &#145;righteous labour, and sweat of our browes&#146;, work should begin in making the Earth &#145;<i>a common Treasury of livelihood to whole mankind, without respect of persons</i>&#146;  (Sabine, 190, 257, 260, 266, 315). Complaints, however, were soon made to the authorities against these &#145;new fangled&#146;, &#145;distracted, crack brained&#146;, &#145;disorderly and tumultuous sort of people&#146; (Raymond, 393; <span class="italic">Impartiall Intelligencer</span>, no. 8, 18&#150;25 April 1649, 61; Firth, 2.209&#150;10). Wary of a royalist rendezvous gathered under cover of the commotion caused by such &#145;ridiculous&#146; activities, the council of state instructed Lord General Thomas Fairfax to investigate. Two cavalry troops under the command of Captain John Gladman therefore marched from London, four advance riders encountering Everard and Winstanley while the remaining twenty or more Diggers&#151;&#145;feeble souls&#146; with &#145;empty bellies&#146;&#151;were dispersed  (Raymond, 395). According to one report, frequently reprinted in the newsbooks, Everard and Winstanley refused to remove their hats in deference to Fairfax. Moreover it was said that Everard had asserted that:<blockquote>he was of the Race of the Jewes, &amp; that all the liberties of the people were lost by the coming in of William the Conquerour; and that ever since, the people of God have lived under tyranny and oppression. (Raymond, 394)</blockquote>But now the &#145;time of deliverance was at hand, and God would bring his people&#146; out of their Egyptian &#145;slavery&#146; and &#145;restore them their freedoms&#146;, thereby enabling them to enjoy &#145;the fruits and benefits of the Earth&#146;. Intending to &#145;restore the Creation to its former Condition&#146;, the Diggers justified their actions as a fulfilment of the prophecy &#145;<i>This Land which was barren and wast is now become fruitfull and pleasant like the Garden of</i> Eden&#146;  (<span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> 36:35). In addition, by renewing &#145;the ancient Community&#146; and distributing the earth's produce to the poor and needy they performed gospel injunctions to feed the hungry and clothe the naked. The Diggers thus welcomed those who would willingly submit to their communal precepts&#151;especially the golden rule &#145;to do to others as we would be done unto&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speeches of the Lord General Fairfax &hellip; to the Diggers</span>, 40), promising to provide newcomers with food, drink, clothing, and other necessities. They were also opposed to using weapons in self-defence and when one was struck he turned the other cheek. Nonetheless, Walton's inhabitants were predominantly hostile to the &#145;new Plantation&#146; on St George's Hill. Winstanley claimed that several Diggers were imprisoned in Walton church and beaten by the &#145;rude multitude&#146;, while the acre of ground they had worked was &#145;trampled down&#146; and &#145;re-levelled&#146;, their &#145;new Creation utterly destroyed&#146; by the &#145;Country people&#146; thereabouts  (<span class="italic">Modest Narrative of Intelligence</span>, no. 4, 21&#150;28 April 1649, 32). Undeterred, a &#145;considerable party&#146; of Diggers returned intending to sow hempseed. Within days they had issued their first manifesto, <span class="italic">The True Levellers Standard Advanced</span>, the London bookseller George Thomason dating his copy 26 April 1649. Everard and Winstanley headed the list of fifteen named subscribers, contending that so long as a system of landlords and their rent-paying tenants persisted, the &#145;Great Creator Reason&#146; remained &#145;mightily dishonoured&#146;. Buying, selling, and enclosing land, which had been gotten through oppression, murder, or theft, kept it &#145;in the hands of a few&#146;, placing the &#145;Creation under bondage&#146;. Nor would the English be a &#145;Free People&#146; until the landless poor were permitted &#145;to dig and labour the Commons&#146; and &#145;Waste land&#146;, averting starvation through their &#145;righteous Labours&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gerrard Winstanley</span>, 2.1&#150;39). Everard's name does not appear in connection with the Diggers again, though in May mistaken reports in the press placed him with the Leveller mutiny in Oxfordshire, the newsbook writers confusing him with the army agitator Captain Robert Everard.<br>
<br>In August 1649 Everard appeared at Bradfield, Berkshire, where John Pordage was rector, although Pordage was to claim that Everard's appearance was in the form of &#145;a spirit&#146;, with &#145;his wearing apparel, Band, Cuffs, Hat, &amp;c.&#146;  (Pordage, 72). The following summer Everard reappeared at Bradfield, this time in the guise of a harvest worker, much in the manner of his former comrade Winstanley, who had found employ as a wheat thresher on Lady Eleanor Douglas's estate at Pirton, Hertfordshire. Then, on Sunday 8 September 1650, there was bedlam in Bradfield. It was reported that Pordage had fled the local church in a &#145;Trance, running out &hellip; and bellowing like a Bull&#146;, before retiring to his rectory. The previous Sunday, 1 September, a thirteen-year-old boy called William Snelling had recited mysterious verses proclaiming &#145;the great Jehova&#146;. The likelihood is that Pordage, Everard, and &#145;one Tawny, who stiled himself King of the Jews&#146; had been together at the rectory in Bradfield on or about that day. This &#145;Tawny&#146; was Theaurau John Tany, the self-proclaimed prophet and lord's high priest of the Jews. Local suspicions, however, pointed to &#145;one Everet&#146;, &#145;reputed to be a Conjurer&#146; and a &#145;man suspected to be a Sorcerer or Witch&#146;, as the malefic presence in the parish (<span class="italic">A most Faithful Relation</span>, 2, 4; Pordage, 9, 11&#150;12; Fowler, 54, 59&#150;60; Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D 864, fol. 233<i>v</i>; a riddle, 1 Sept 1650?). This &#145;Everet&#146; was William Everard, and shortly after, in September 1650, Everard was seen in a &#145;frantick posture&#146; in London  (<span class="italic">A Most Faithful Relation</span>, 4). In October he was apprehended. His ravings proved to be feigned and, in accordance with the instructions of the council of state, he was committed to Bridewell by order of the lord mayor of London at the sessions of the peace. His wife failed to find the money necessary to have him removed to Bethlem Hospital. All the while Everard's &#145;distracted&#146; state persisted. In November he was &#145;manacled&#146; for violent and desperate behaviour, and in December it was reported that &#145;many of Ranting Everard's party are lunatick, and exceedingly distracted; they talk very high against the Parliament, and this present Government; for which some of them have received the lash&#146; (court minute book of Bridewell and Bethlem Hospital, MS 33011/9, pp. 464, 471; <span class="italic">The Ranters Recantation and their Sermon</span>, 1650, 6). By February 1651, Everard had become so &#145;distracted&#146; and &#145;outragious&#146; that he could no longer be kept in Bridewell &#145;without dainger&#146;. It was ordered that he be removed to Bethlem Hospital, &#145;there to be kept with diett phisick&#146;  (court minute book of Bridewell and Bethlem Hospital, MS 33011/9, p. 484). On 19 March 1651 William Everard was sent to Bethlem Hospital. Nothing more can be said of him with certainty except that if he died at Bethlem then, unlike another patient, he was not buried at St Botolph without Bishopsgate. A William Everard was, however, buried at St Katherine Cree, London, on 2 March 1659.<br>
