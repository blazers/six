<span class="headword">Percy,  Alan Ian</span>, eighth duke of Northumberland  (1880&#150;1930), <span class="occ">politician and propagandist</span>, was born on 17 April 1880 in London, the seventh of the thirteen children and fourth of the seven sons of Henry George Percy, Earl Percy (1846&#150;1918), from 1899 seventh duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Lady Edith Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1913), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4500/', "George Campbell, eighth duke of Argyll")</script>. Although born into privilege and acquiring a great inheritance, his childhood was austere and his mature life one of relentless activity and commitment&#151;products of a family tradition not just of public service but also the stern evangelistic faith of the Irvingite Catholic Apostolic church, a sect within the Church of England. He was educated at Eton College (1893&#150;7) and at Christ Church, Oxford (1897&#150;9), though with an aristocratic younger son's intention of making his career in the army. He joined the Grenadier Guards in 1900, saw active service in the South African War (1901&#150;2), and was promoted to lieutenant in 1903. From 1907 to 1910 he served in the Egyptian army, in 1908 as captain of a company of Arab camel corps during the Kordofan campaign in the Sudan. After returning to the British army he was in 1910&#150;11 an additional aide-de-camp to the fourth Earl Grey, governor-general of Canada, before retiring in 1912 with the rank of major and with his prospects transformed. His eldest brother, Henry, Earl Percy, MP, had died in 1909, and as his second and third brothers died in childhood he succeeded as heir to the dukedom, and to the courtesy title of Earl Percy. In 1911 he married Lady Helen Magdalen Gordon-Lennox (1886&#150;1965), youngest daughter of Charles, seventh duke of Richmond and Gordon. They had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Percy's military interests now found a new outlet, which gradually developed into an unusual career for one of his lineage and status: that of publicist, controversialist, and publisher. In essays and articles during 1911 and 1913 he forecast war with Germany, criticized the Haldane army reforms, argued that the proposed expeditionary force was far too small, and supported Lord Roberts's calls for military conscription. Events from 1914 no doubt confirmed the sense of prophetic power which so imbued his subsequent writings. On the outbreak of the First World War he rejoined his regiment and was for two years an official eye-witness, supplying battle-front descriptions to newspapers. The resulting journalistic experience and contacts with editors was put to less official uses after his appointment in 1916 to the directorate of military operations, attached as a lieutenant-colonel to the general staff in London. A vigorous partisan of the army command during the great debates from 1916 to 1918 with opposition politicians and government ministers over strategy and logistics, he supplied sympathetic journalists, particularly H. A. Gwynne, editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, with inside information and counter-arguments to support the generals' cause. By 1918 he had a deep distrust of the political &eacute;lite, and an especial loathing for Lloyd George.<br>
<br>On his father's death in May 1918, and after a second retirement from the army at the end of the war, Northumberland entered into the large possessions and numerous public, institutional, and social duties of the Northumberland dukedom. To these he added still further involvements. Rarely content with merely honorific status he became a man of many causes&#151;agricultural, industrial, historical, archaeological, scientific, ecclesiastical. A long list of positions includes lord lieutenant of Northumberland, president of the Northumberland Territorial Army Association and the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries, master of the Percy hunt, chancellor of Durham University, and president of the Institution of Naval Architects. He was both president of the Royal Institution, in succession to his grandfather and father, and an active lay churchman, as chairman of the house of laymen of York diocese and from 1919 to 1923 vice-chairman of the national church assembly's house of laity. Two of his short stories were published posthumously: <span class="italic">The Shadow on the Moor</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">La salamandre</span> (1934).<br>
<br>Northumberland's kindly interest in the concerns of his tenants and organizational associates attracted affection, in striking contrast to the enmities he paraded and provoked in his politics. His inheritance included his father's diehard Conservatism, which he characteristically turned into yet more extravagantly reactionary opinions. The owner of three great houses and some 180,000 acres spread across Northumberland, Middlesex, and Surrey, there was nothing apologetic about his defence of property. A robust justification of his huge coal royalties in evidence to the Sankey coal commission of 1919, against the miners' union and socialist criticisms of Robert Smillie, Frank Hodges, Sidney Webb, and Richard Tawney, gave him a notoriety which encouraged him to offer a wider political lead. The <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist described him as &#145;a strong Tory, militant and uncompromising&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Aug 1930); less friendly commentators thought him either a dangerous fanatic or a useful example of reactionary absurdity. Yet in the tense post-war public atmosphere his views had real purchase among discontented Conservatives, and from 1920 he became important as a leader of the diehard movement against the Lloyd George coalition government. He joined the fourth marquess of Salisbury's Association of Independent Unionist Peers, and had a small following among Conservative back-bench MPs. But his main contribution lay in a rare talent for written invective, in numerous intemperate yet penetrating articles in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> and the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, and in his books, <span class="italic">International Revolutionary Propaganda</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Conspiracy Against the British Empire</span> (1921), <span class="italic">The Passing of Liberalism</span> (1925), and the posthumously published <span class="italic">The History of World Revolution</span> (1954). He created further outlets for this peculiarly ferocious style of propaganda in founding the Boswell Press (1921) and the <span class="italic">Patriot</span> (1922). His anti-Liberalism was nearly as strong as his anti-socialism, and his anti-communism was obsessive: for him Liberalism represented the start of a slippery descent into the atheistic and expropriatory horrors of Bolshevism. No less obsessive were his British chauvinism, contempt for the League of Nations, hatred of anti-imperialist movements, and his antisemitism. Everywhere he saw danger, betrayal, and plots: wittingly or not Indian and Egyptian nationalists, Irish republicans, and the British Labour Party were all members of an international revolutionary movement against British power directed by Bolshevik-Jewish adventurers in Moscow. From such a perspective, a coalition government led by and including Liberal ministers was manifestly incapable of defending anything of value. In autumn 1921 he tried unsuccessfully to mount a party revolt against the Conservative leadership over the government's treaty with Irish republicans; his alternative solution was the military reconquest of Ireland. In March 1922 he was a co-signatory to the diehard manifesto which announced a combined rebellion of various elements of the Conservative right, and in June he used the honours scandal for a particularly bitter attack on Lloyd George. For the rest of the decade he persistently sought to expose Lloyd George's political fund as a source of public corruption.<br>
<br>After the collapse of the coalition government in October 1922 Northumberland was reconciled to a Conservative leadership now formally freed of Liberal pollution, even, surprisingly, tolerating Stanley Baldwin's Conservatism. He was president of the Conservative National Union in 1924, and by the time he succeeded Lord Salisbury as chairman of the Association of Independent Unionist Peers this had mellowed from a group of rebels into the back-bench Conservative organization in the House of Lords. Also during 1924, under Conservative central office prompting, he led a consortium to buy the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, securing it from the unfriendly clutches of Lord Rothermere. After withdrawing from the Boswell Press and the <span class="italic">Patriot</span> he became an active newspaper proprietor, commenting regularly on editorial policy and continuing to publish articles on causes dear to the Conservative right. He thought the labour disputes of 1925&#150;6 &#145;a vast conspiracy to ruin the country, to starve the workers &amp; destroy civilisation&#146;  (to Gwynne, 26 Sept 1925, H. A. Gwynne MSS), and again defended coal royalty owners during the Samuel coal commission hearings. However, his inflammatory brand of reactionary politics had now lost much of their force and following. He died on 23 August 1930 at his home, 17 Princes Gate, London.<br>
