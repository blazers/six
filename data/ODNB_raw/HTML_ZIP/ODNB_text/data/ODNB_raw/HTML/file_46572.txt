<span class="headword">Anderson, Sir  John</span>  (1814&#150;1886), <span class="occ">inventor of ordnance manufacture machinery and arsenal manager</span>, was born at Woodside, near Aberdeen, on 9 December 1814, the posthumous child of a local merchant, J. Anderson, and his wife, Helen Hosie. His mother remarried and his stepfather, Irvine Kempt, employed him at the Woodside cotton works of Gordon, Barron &amp; Co. from the age of thirteen. He served an apprenticeship there as a mechanic, on the completion of which he left, in 1839, to gain wider experience; he then worked for several engineering concerns in Manchester and London. In 1840 he married Eliza Norrie, with whom he had a daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>In 1842 Anderson was recommended by the shipbuilder David Napier for the position as foreman at the brass gun foundry at Woolwich arsenal. Although the position was not well remunerated, Anderson saw the factory's potential. The works had scarcely changed since the end of the Napoleonic wars and Anderson rapidly mechanized the manufacture of ordnance, much of the machinery being of his own invention. He is credited with devising sixteen different machines for armaments manufacture, including one which could produce 40,000 bullets per hour. Uniform working hours were introduced and other working practices overhauled. Anderson also oversaw the modernization of the government gunpowder mills at Waltham Abbey in Essex. One of his inventions was an unattended machine for granulating gunpowder.<br>
<br>After a visit to the United States in 1854, Anderson recommended the establishment of a government small-arms factory using American-style techniques of mass production. He wanted this to be part of the Woolwich complex but the authorities opted to expand an existing facility at Enfield Lock, Middlesex, albeit under Anderson's direction. This freed the government from its dependence on private manufacturers, with their reliance on slow and expensive craft-based techniques, and the Enfield armoury soon proved an enormous success.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Crimean War led to new demands on Anderson's abilities, the greatest of which was the establishment of a factory for the manufacture of Lancaster shells; he completed the project at great personal sacrifice, in the space of only two months. A floating factory was also prepared for dispatch to the Crimea. In 1859, when the government decided on the production of rifled field-guns, he was appointed assistant superintendent of the royal gun factory under Sir William Armstrong. From 1866 until his retirement in 1872 he was superintendent of machinery.<br>
<br>Anderson's efforts in public service were considered to have worn out a constitution that was never strong, but he confounded expectations by enjoying a long retirement. He had already served as a juror at international exhibitions in London (1862) and Paris (1867). In 1873 he was vice-president of the jury for machinery at Vienna and president of the machinery group at Philadelphia (1876) and Paris (1878). It was after this last exhibition that he was knighted. He was also made an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by the French and a commander of the order of Franz Josef by the Austrians. He was honoured in 1871 by becoming LLD at St Andrews University and by being elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1881 he was awarded the freedom of the city of Aberdeen on the occasion of his presentation of a public library to his native village of Woodside. This neatly brought his career full circle, for as a boy Anderson had been honorary librarian of his local church. After his death at his home, Fairleigh, 8 The Mount, St Leonards, Sussex, on 28 July 1886, his body was returned to Aberdeen for burial in the churchyard of St Nicholas on 3 August. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Anderson's work was his passion and he had no thought to profit from his expertise beyond what the government chose to pay him. He was a keen lecturer and the writer of a number of technical papers and a single book, <span class="italic">The Strength of Materials and Structures</span> (1872), which passed through numerous editions.<br>
