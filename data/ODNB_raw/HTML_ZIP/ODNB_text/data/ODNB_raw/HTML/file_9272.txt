<span class="headword">Felton,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1570), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic martyr</span>, was, according to an account given in 1627 by his daughter, Frances Salisbury, related to the protestant Feltons of Norfolk but occupied the former Bermondsey Abbey, Surrey. Salisbury added that her mother was maid of honour to Mary I and formerly wife of her auditor, adding (rather implausibly) that she was also so favoured by Elizabeth that the queen, after executing her second husband, licensed her to keep a priest in her house. Perhaps Salisbury's mother was the Ellyn Goodwin married in St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, on 30 July 1557 to a John Felton, who had successive infant daughters baptized Frances there in 1560, 1564, and 1565. It seems that Felton was not then a recusant, but his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9276/', "Thomas Felton (1566x8&#150;1588)")</script>, a Franciscan friar and, in his turn, a Roman Catholic martyr, was not baptized in the parish church.<br>
<br>Felton's devotion to the papal primacy led him to publish in England (and so give it canonical effect) <span class="italic">Regnans in excelsis</span>, the bull of excommunication and deposition against Elizabeth issued by Pius V, by nailing a copy to the door of the bishop of London's palace by St Paul's Cathedral on 25 May 1570. Salisbury said that Felton went to Calais to collect the bull himself and affixed it with Lawrence Webb, who fled abroad and became professor of moral theology at Douai. However, contemporary sources, both government and Catholic, said that the bull came from a chaplain of Guerau de Spes, the Spanish ambassador, Pedro Berga, prebendary of Tarragona. A second version of the indictment named Felton's accomplice as &#145;Cornelius Irishman, clerk&#146;, probably an alias. The ubiquitous intriguer Roberto di Ridolfi seems to have been the ultimate importer of copies of the bull, including one which Felton gave to a member of Lincoln's Inn who was caught in the subsequent raids and forced to name him.<br>
<br>Felton was arrested and did not attempt to deny his actions. He was imprisoned in Newgate and &#145;by writing, signed by his own hand&#146;, on 27 June he treasonably &#145;declared that the queen &hellip; ought not to be the queen of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fourth Report of the Deputy Keeper</span>, 265). However, as he would not admit to &#145;speech with the Spanish ambassador&#146; it had already been decided on 25 June that he should be racked at the Tower of London  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1558&#150;70</i>, 373); so after some delay Felton probably became &#145;the first of a long procession of Catholics tortured for reasons of state&#146;  (P. Williams, <span class="italic">The Tudor Regime</span>, 1979, 393), if without further result.<br>
<br>On 28 July Felton was still at the Tower. He was arraigned at the Guildhall on 4 August, apparently brought from Newgate, not from the Tower as Salisbury believed. He was charged with asserting &#145;that the queen had never been true queen of England&#146;  (TNA: PRO, KB 8/41, m. 31), a position derived from the bull, although arguably based on heresy at accession rather than illegitimacy. Though apparently sentenced to Tyburn, on 8 August he was returned to St Paul's Churchyard to be executed at the scene of his crime. Assertions of proper repentance are outnumbered by statements, both protestant and Catholic, that he asked pardon of any whom he had injured but denied that the queen was one&#151;he had merely promulgated a proper papal statement. Repelling protestant clergymen he made an ostentatiously Catholic end even under the pressure of prompt cutting down and quartering: &#145;having his heart in his hand, he said once or twice, &#147;Jesus&#148;&#146;  (Pollen, <span class="italic">Acts</span>, 211).<br>
<br>Felton reduced the perquisites of the hangman Bull (in whose name protestants found a providential pun) by sending a diamond ring worth &pound;400 to Elizabeth via Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex&#151;a later occupant of Bermondsey Abbey and perhaps even his immediate landlord. Salisbury claimed that &pound;33,000 worth of plate and jewels was seized after Felton's death. This seems an incredible sum and may perhaps be business stock&#151;Sir William Cecil noted a John Felton in 1568 as selling &pound;265 worth of ingots used for an alchemical fraud. Protestant balladeers inevitably took an unfavourable view of Felton's slightly obscure position:<blockquote>
<div>A roisting shifting prodigall so he his time did spend<br>
</div>
<div>Which sought of ev'ry one to have that able was to lend &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Ne landes he had ne hands did seek to get the bread he eat &hellip;<br>
</div> (Knell, sigs. A3<i>v</i>&#150;4<i>r</i>)</blockquote>Felton's widow was said to have brought her third husband, a recusant named John Strangman, &#145;ffyftye pound by the yere at London and aboute Brystow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellanea XII</span>, 42). She was still living in 1577.<br>
<br>For Richard Bristow, Felton was preceded as martyr by the 1569 rebels  (R. Bristow, <span class="italic">A Briefe Treatise of Diverse Plaine and Sure Wayes</span>, 1574, fol. 73<i>r</i>). Most martyrologists drew the line at them, but by 1741 even Felton was tacitly excluded by Richard Challoner. His case was still troublesome, however, &#145;the one case in the whole list where a Catholic &hellip; commits an arguably treasonable act&#146;  (P. Hughes, <span class="italic">Rome and the Counter-Reformation in England</span>, 1942, 251). Protestant propaganda always asserted that execution for treason, for Catholics, constituted martyrdom <i>ipso facto</i>. <span class="italic">Regnans in excelsis</span> unfortunately served to entangle the two.<br>
