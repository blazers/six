<span class="headword">Ward,  John</span>  (1599?&#150;1658?), <span class="occ">parliamentarian officer and poet</span>, was a native of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. Both his date of birth and parentage are unknown, though the baptism of a John Ward, son of Thomas, at Tewkesbury Abbey on 10 June 1599 may refer to the poet  (Glos. RO, bishop's transcripts). Ward was a puritan, and at the outbreak of the civil war he became &#145;commissary generall of the provisions&#146; to the troops of horse under William Russell, fifth earl of Bedford. On 13 October 1642 Ward printed <span class="italic">An encouragement to warre, or, Bellum parliamentale, shewing the unlawfulnesse of the late Bellum episcopale</span>, in which he vents his spleen against the moral and theological shortcomings of the cavaliers. The poem was reissued on 4 July 1643 as <span class="italic">The Christians incouragement earnestly to contend for Christ his gospell &amp; for all our Christian liberties in thrall which who refuseth let him be for aye accursed</span>. It was printed along with an anonymous tract entitled <span class="italic">The humble petition of the protestant inhabitants of the counties of Antrim, Downe, Tyrone, &amp;c</span>, first published in 1641. On 12 December 1642 Ward participated in the storming of Winchester and the capture of Lord Grandison under the command of Sir William Waller. He celebrated the event in the poem <span class="italic">The Taking of Winchester by the Parliaments Forces</span>. Ward gives a detailed account of the whole skirmish. He laments over Grandison's subsequent escape from captivity, and marshals Gloucestershire and Tewkesbury in particular, to stand against the royalists. Ward may also be the author of the militantly republican poem &#145;The changes, or, A vicissitude of change of government&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 49), written shortly after the dissolution of the Long Parliament on 20 April 1653. He calls upon the people &#145;to strip away the veils of custom and to see more deeply into the age's political possibilities&#146;  (Norbrook, 13.185).<br>
<br>The remainder of Ward's military career is shrouded in mystery. It is impossible to be certain that the details of two (or three) John Wards are not being conflated, but he may have been the John Ward who was made captain of a troop of foot soldiers in Yorkshire on 10 April 1650. Three and a half years later the treasurers of Ely House, the hospital for soldiers and sailors, granted a pension to one John Ward, &#145;in respect of his poverty and wounds in the service&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 25/72, p. 28). According to his widow, Anne, Captain Ward had served from the beginning of the wars, and during the early part of the protectorate he was a member of Cromwell's household guard under Walter Strickland. Thereafter he joined Colonel Henry Lillingston's regiment at Dunkirk and was killed at the battle of the Dunes on 4 June 1658. Ward died intestate. Sir William Lockhart, colonel of the Flanders horse, appealed to John Thurloe in respect of his widow, &#145;to move something in her behalf, that may be an encouragement to other married officers amongst us&#146;  (Thurloe, 7.224). Anne and her two young children were granted a solatium of &pound;100.<br>
