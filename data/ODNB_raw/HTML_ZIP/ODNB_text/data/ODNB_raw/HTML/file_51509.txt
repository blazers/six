<span class="headword">Broadbent, Sir  Ewen</span>  (1924&#150;1993), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at 23 Vesta Road, Brockley, London, on 9 August 1924, the only child of the Revd Wilfred Broadbent (1880&#150;1945), Baptist minister, and his Scottish wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ewen (1890&#150;1972). He attended King Edward VI School, Nuneaton, where he was an almost precocious schoolboy, excelling at languages and games, and was head boy and captain of cricket. In 1942 he moved on to St John's College, Cambridge, to read modern languages, but in 1943 war interrupted his studies. He joined the Gordon Highlanders, in which he rose to the rank of captain, and saw service in Egypt and Norway. He returned to Cambridge in 1947 and graduated in 1949 with a distinction in oral German.<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge, Broadbent took the home civil service and the Foreign Office examinations. He was in the top three of both. He joined the Air Ministry as an assistant principal in 1949. He rapidly made his mark and after being private secretary to two official members of the Air Council he was private secretary to three successive secretaries of state for air, from 1955 to 1959. These were difficult times&#151;the Suez crisis, spiralling costs of equipment, and much argument both within the Air Ministry and among the three services. Broadbent maintained a steady hand and earned widespread respect. In 1959 he was promoted assistant secretary and in 1961 he was dispatched to Cyprus as deputy chief officer of the recently established British sovereign base areas, becoming chief officer in 1964. He established an administration which stood the test of time remarkably well. After returning to Whitehall in 1965 he was private secretary to the secretary of state for defence, Denis Healey, from 1967 to 1968, and spent eighteen months deeply involved in the contentious arguments of the time, particularly those concerning the withdrawal of British forces from the Far East.<br>
<br>In January 1969 Broadbent became an assistant under-secretary, but soon after disaster struck. He was rushed to hospital following a heart attack and suffered another heart attack after leaving intensive care. It was a measure of the man that he returned to work in the autumn of 1969 and in 1972 became deputy under-secretary of state (air) with a seat on the air force board. It had become increasingly apparent that Broadbent had a particular talent for management and organization, coupled with the ability to persuade people to do what he wanted. Hence in 1975 he became deputy under-secretary of state (civilian management) for the whole of the Ministry of Defence. In 1982 he became second permanent under-secretary of state with a seat on each of the three service boards, which were primarily concerned with the organization and management of their services. For nearly a decade he took pride of place in bringing about changes in management and organization. He was firm but fair. One yardstick of his success was that during this period the number of civilian employees in the Ministry of Defence was reduced by about 25 per cent. Broadbent oversaw and managed these changes with great skill, and rightly earned the respect of the trade unions. He tackled the thorny question of reorganizing the Ministry of Defence police and placing them on a statutory footing. He was deeply involved in implementing the reforms that Michael Heseltine introduced soon after he became secretary of state for defence in 1983.<br>
<br>Broadbent was renowned for his immense ability to bring about change without too much bloodshed. He was a fine judge of what was possible, but with a strong bias for moving forward. His skills in dealing with people had no doubt been honed by his six private secretary appointments. His determination and courage were exemplified by his success in rising to the highest ranks of his service, despite his illness in 1969. His character was perhaps the result of his Scottish ancestry and of his being a son of the manse. He was by any standards a first-class administrator. His benign and gentle appearance belied his effectiveness. He had an ironic sense of humour and a generally quizzical approach, and much enjoyed the company of his many friends.<br>
<br>Following his retirement Broadbent was in much demand. He was vice-chairman of the Council of the Royal United Service Institute for which he wrote a book, <span class="italic">The Military and Government</span>, published in 1988; vice-chairman of the Farnborough Aerospace Development Foundation and of the Carroll Foundation, which endowed the chair of Irish history at Hertford College, Oxford; chairman of International Military Services; and an enthusiastic trustee of the Royal Air Force Museum. He was also as a trustee deeply involved in seeking to recover the missing millions from the Daily Mirror pension fund. Perhaps closest to his heart was his chairmanship of the Council of Voluntary Welfare Work from 1985, and from 1988 of Look Ahead&#151;the latter dedicated to providing temporary homes in south London for single homeless people, and training them for jobs. In both these active appointments he felt he was partly redeeming a debt to those less fortunate than himself.<br>
<br>Broadbent was a fine sportsman all his life. In his earlier days he played much squash and cricket. He later concentrated on golf and found time to be captain of his club and write its centennial history. He was appointed CMG in 1965, CB in 1973, and KCB in 1984. On 3 February 1951 he married Barbara David (<i>b</i>. 1919), then a squadron leader in the Women's Royal Air Force. They had one son. Broadbent died of a heart attack on Hampstead golf course on 27 February 1993; his remains were cremated at Breakspear crematorium, Ruislip, Middlesex, on 4 March. He was survived by his wife and son.<br>
