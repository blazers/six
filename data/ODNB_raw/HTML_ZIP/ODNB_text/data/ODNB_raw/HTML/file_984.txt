<span class="headword">Backhouse,  Edward</span>  (1808&#150;1879), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and historical writer</span>, was born at Darlington on 8 May 1808, the son of Edward and Mary Backhouse. He lived from his youth at Sunderland, where he was partner in the collieries and the bank with which his family had been connected for many years, although he took no active part in the business. He was fond of travel, a good amateur painter, and a student of natural history. He devoted himself chiefly to the promotion of philanthropic and religious causes. He was a generous supporter of various institutions in Sunderland, including a mission hall which he founded in one of the poorer districts, and is said to have spent over &pound;10,000 a year on charities. In politics he was an energetic Liberal, and especially interested in questions bearing directly upon morality. In later life he was a prominent opponent of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, providing significant financial support to the Ladies' National Association for their repeal. He was a devoted member of the Society of Friends, to which his family belonged. He began to preach in 1852, and two years later was recognized as a minister. In 1862 and 1863 he served as clerk to the yearly meeting of Friends in London. He married Katharine, daughter of Thomas and Mary Mounsey of Sunderland, in 1856. They had no children, but he always enjoyed the company of the young and the promotion of their happiness. From 1874 until his death he devoted himself to church history; his manuscript, edited by Charles Tylor, was published in 1884 as <span class="italic">Early Church History to the Death of Constantine</span>. The book, which makes no pretence to profound research, is interesting as an account of the early church from the Quaker point of view. Backhouse's health deteriorated in 1878; the following year he went to Hastings for a change of climate, and died there on 22 May 1879.<br>
