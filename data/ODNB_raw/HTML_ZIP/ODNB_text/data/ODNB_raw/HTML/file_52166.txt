<span class="headword">Chigwell,  Hamo</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Hamond Dene]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1332), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was born Hamond Dene, the son of Thomas and Cecilia Dene; like Richard Chigwell, from whom he inherited a life interest in some property and whose surname he took, he became a fishmonger, thus entering one of the most successful and best-organized trades in Edward II's London. He was in Great Yarmouth when he was elected sheriff on 21 September 1314 and he may, like his fellow fish merchants, have had shipping and sheds for salting herring there. He traded in wine and some grain as well as in fish: a cargo in one of his own ships included oils and spices along with the wine. Chigwell served from 1315 to 1329 as alderman of Queenhithe ward where he and his wife, Maud, lived, in the parish of St Mary Mounthaw, and where he was well placed at the hub of the market in fish and grain.<br>
<br>Throughout the decade following 28 October 1319, when he was first elected mayor, until his arrest in February 1329, Chigwell was the dominating figure in London politics. Despite his mounting difficulties, and notwithstanding the grant of a charter to London in 1319, Edward II, with the help of Hugh Despenser the younger, was then determined to assert control over his turbulent capital, while the Londoners were eager to take advantage of the king's problems to secure their own interests. By force of personality and diplomatic skills, as well as by less acceptable means, Chigwell retained, for much of the time, both royal favour and the support of many Londoners. One chronicler, commenting on the support he received from both men and women, voiced contemporary doubts about him: &#145;Many said, he is a good man; but others, no, no, he deceives the people&#146;  (Stubbs, 346). In 1321 Edward openly attacked London's rights when he sent royal justices to hold an eyre in the city, which from 13 January to 20 May challenged privileges and investigated grievances. On 23 February Chigwell's successor as mayor was replaced by a royal warden. He and his allies survived suspicions of conspiracy but Chigwell had to defend wholesale fishmongers against critics of the ordinances agreed in their court, which was itself challenged. But Chigwell's influence in London led Edward to make use of him: he became mayor, nominally elected but in effect at the king's will, from 26 May 1321 until 4 April 1323, and again, after an interval when he and three of his supporters were virtually prisoners at court, from 6 December 1323 until November 1326, when the city was once more allowed freely to elect its own mayor.<br>
<br>Chigwell, with the backing of a key group of leading merchants, proved able for several years to manipulate the shifting interests which faced him. The king entrusted various responsibilities to him: after the execution of Thomas of Lancaster in March 1322, he was appointed one of the commissioners who pronounced judgment on other rebels and who in July tried and condemned to death Roger Mortimer, soon to be spirited from the Tower of London with the help of two of Chigwell's opponents. But under his leadership the city's council resisted royal requests for more men and money, and sought the restoration of the mayoralty. While London citizens were united in their determination to protect their privileges, particularly control of admission to the freedom, the city merchants represented conflicting commercial interests. Royal support of alien merchants, and the reimposition in 1322 of the <span class="italic">Carta mercatoria</span> (Edward I's grant of 1303, giving protection and privileges to alien merchants), suspended since 1311, checked the fiscal advantages which had encouraged some London merchants to extend their overseas trade. Attempts by the Bardi, the Italian royal financiers, to evade taxation and the wool staple alienated others. The staple, an arrangement whereby all exports of wool had to be channelled through a particular town in the Low Countries, divided leading merchants, since different towns favoured different traders. Pressure mounted for the choice of home staples, finally achieved in May 1326, when Hugh Despenser made a belated attempt to pacify an increasingly hostile city.<br>
<br>Mob violence in London in October 1326 doomed the unpopular king and his favourite, and London eventually welcomed Queen Isabella with Mortimer and the young prince, Edward. Chigwell himself, &#145;crying mercy with clasped hands&#146;  (Riley, 262), finally agreed to popular demands that he and the city's council support the prince. Yet his position was strong enough for him to be freely elected mayor on 28 October 1327, and only pressure for compromise prevented his election in October 1328. But he was soon openly backing Mortimer's enemies and his involvement in the dispute between the town and abbey of Bury St Edmunds led to his conviction as a felon on 13 February 1329. Benefit of clergy saved him from the death penalty, but he spent the next year in the care of the bishop of London. He returned to London in January 1330 to be welcomed by aldermen and citizens who escorted him to his home. He died in 1332, leaving, in the part of his will that was dated 16 June 1332 and enrolled before the court of husting on 22 February 1333, a bequest to St Paul's, where he was buried and remembered by a monument. He was survived by his wife but not apparently by any children.<br>
