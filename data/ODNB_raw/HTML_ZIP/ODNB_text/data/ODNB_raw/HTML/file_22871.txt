<span class="headword">Puiset,  Hugh  du</span>, earl of Northumberland  (<em>c.</em>1125&#150;1195), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was the younger son of Hugues, lord of Le Puiset, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Stephen, count of Blois, and Adela (<i>d</i>. 1137), a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29448/', "William I")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlyadvancement"></a>Family background and early advancement</h2>Le Puiset, 38 kilometres south-east of Chartres, was the site of a strong castle, first built in the eleventh century, which enjoyed a strategic position covering the route from the &Icirc;le-de-France to Orl&eacute;ans. Its lords had over several generations acquired a reputation as violent and aggressive exploiters of feudal power. Hugues seems to have gone to the Holy Land in 1129, following what had become a family tradition of crusading activity. In the same year Hugh's brother-in-law Henry de Blois (<i>d</i>. 1171), one of the younger brothers of Count Theobald (son and successor of Count Stephen), was given the rich bishopric of Winchester by Henry I, having already been abbot of Glastonbury for three years. It was natural that a younger son of the Le Puiset family, directly descended from William the Conqueror, should look for preferment in the English church. And when Count Theobald's next youngest brother, Stephen, count of Mortain, gained the English throne at the end of 1135, the prospects for a nephew of the new king must have seemed bright indeed.<br>
<br>By 1139 Hugh du Puiset had become archdeacon of Winchester, the right-hand man of his uncle Henry. The archbishop of York, Thurstan, died in 1140 and the Blois family interest was mobilized to secure the archbishopric and as much influence as possible in the northern province. In this Blois campaign, Hugh du Puiset co-operated with William Fitzherbert (<i>d</i>. 1154), the treasurer of York and a leading figure in the chapter there, whom, despite what many regarded as his personal unsuitability, the king wished to make archbishop. Before Fitzherbert was driven from his see by the party of church reform, he had obtained for du Puiset (<i>c</i>.1143) the important offices of cathedral treasurer and archdeacon of the East Riding. The period from 1147 to 1153 was occupied by open hostilities or uneasy truces between Archdeacon Hugh and the Cistercian Henry Murdac, abbot of Fountains, who through the influence of Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux and Pope Eugenius III (<i>r</i>. 1145&#150;53) was consecrated archbishop of York at Trier in December 1147. During most of Murdac's troubled pontificate Blois influence in northern England waned, but it recovered strongly, though briefly, before the death of King Stephen in October 1154. In November 1152 the bishop of Durham, William de Ste Barbe, died. Partly because the two strongest local aspirants for the succession, the prior and the archdeacon, were evenly poised, the clergy and people of the diocese (that is, the monks of the cathedral priory and the leading barons of the bishopric) on 22 January 1153 chose Hugh du Puiset, although he was still not twenty-eight years of age, and as such under the canonical age for becoming a bishop.<h2>
<a name="BishopofDurham"></a>Bishop of Durham</h2>For some nine months Archbishop Murdac bitterly opposed the election, declaring it null because it was carried out without his consent, as metropolitan, and also because of the elect's youth and scandalous lifestyle. He excommunicated the electors, who appealed to the papal curia, to which they dispatched a delegation accompanied by the bishop-elect himself. Luckily for du Puiset Pope Eugenius died in July 1153 and his more sympathetic successor Anastasius IV (<i>r</i>. 1153&#150;4) consecrated du Puiset on 21 December. Meanwhile Archbishop Murdac had died (14 October), and the way was clear for the new bishop of Durham to return to his diocese and be enthroned in his cathedral on 2 May 1154. He was supported by the now restored Archbishop Fitzherbert who, however, died a month later. The window of opportunity for the Blois family interest had been opened barely long enough for Hugh du Puiset to become established in his see. It closed decisively with King Stephen's death on 25 October and the accession of Henry of Anjou (Henry II) on 19 December 1154. Already the see of York had been refilled: Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, a clerk and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury, was consecrated in October 1154. Since Bishop &AElig;thelwold of Carlisle died <i>c</i>.1156 and his see was not filled again until 1204, the north of England was dominated ecclesiastically for nearly thirty years by two prelates bent on self-aggrandizement and the exploitation of both spiritual and secular authority. And since York had no consecrated archbishop for a decade after Roger's death in 1181, du Puiset enjoyed a virtual monopoly of episcopal and palatine power in northern England until his own death in 1195.<br>
<br>The diocese of Durham comprised what became in the twelfth century the counties of Northumberland and Durham, with the addition of the district of Alston at the head of the south Tyne and (just north of the Tweed and therefore in Scotland) the tiny parish of Wester Upsettlington. Within certain parts of this extensive area the bishop, inheriting a long series of grants of privileges and immunities by kings of the eleventh century and earlier, enjoyed a wholly exceptional position of quasi-royal authority and military power. The rationale behind this &#145;palatine&#146; liberty was defence of England against the Scots, but the real roots of St Cuthbert's Land (or Haliwerfolc&#151;&#145;the Saint's people&#146;&#151;as it was known) derived from Durham's jealously guarded possession of the body and relics of St Cuthbert, the most renowned and venerated of all English saints. Since the time of Bishop Ranulf Flambard (<i>d</i>. 1128) the actual custody of these relics and the responsibility for serving the great cathedral church, begun in 1093 and by 1154 well on the way to completion, lay with the Benedictine monks of the cathedral priory. Nevertheless the bishop as successor of Cuthbert was recognized as effectively abbot of the monastery, and the position into which du Puiset stepped in 1154 was one of the grandest, richest, and most magnificent in the English kingdom.<h2>
<a name="Episcopalsplendour"></a>Episcopal splendour</h2>Hugh du Puiset was determined not to allow the grandeur, wealth, or magnificence to be abated one jot. Untouched by either the clerical zeal of the Gregorian reformers or the humility beloved of the Cistercians and their admirers, he pursued the life of an old-fashioned late-Frankish aristocrat. His relationship with the most prominent of his mistresses, Alice de Percy, was so public and of such long duration that it almost amounted to a marriage. With Alice Bishop Hugh had at least two children, Henry the knight and Hugh, who rose to become chancellor of Philip Augustus, king of France, and perhaps two others, William, archdeacon of Northumberland, and Burchard, archdeacon of Durham and treasurer of York. Hugh du Puiset lived in great style, maintaining a large household, taking with him wherever he went a private chapel richly furnished with liturgical ornaments and vessels of gold and silver. Surviving inventories show that his vestments were of velvet and other expensive cloth, profusely embroidered with pearls and other precious gems and elaborately worked with birds, animals, and motifs drawn from romance and chivalry. At Stanhope in Weardale the bishop's hunting lodge was provided with a new kitchen and larder every year by the local peasantry. When he proposed to undertake a crusading expedition in 1189 a great ship was built, stuffed with so many furnishings and utensils that a house had to be hired to contain them all when the ship was laid up.<br>
<br>Du Puiset was an indefatigable builder, carrying out large-scale work at the castles of Durham, Northallerton, and Norham. He undertook the erection of Elvet Bridge in Durham (some remains of its chapel came to light in 1995) and co-operated with the king of Scots in building the earliest known bridge over the tidal Tweed at Berwick. He founded one hospital, Sherburn, and refounded another, Flambard's hospital of Kepier, both of them near to Durham itself. The crowning glory of his building activity is the Galilee Chapel which in the 1170s he caused to be built against the west front of the cathedral. Although now sadly altered and damaged, it is still possible to appreciate how splendid the chapel must have been originally, consisting of five parallel aisles supported on freestone shafts each provided with a pair of columns of black Purbeck marble. The interior was evidently richly painted and decorated, and the centrepiece was a magnificent altar to the Blessed Virgin. As well as being a great patron of masons and craftsmen, du Puiset, although not himself learned or even especially well educated, formed a considerable library and commissioned the making of two great bibles, one of which, in four large volumes still treasured at Durham  (Durham Cathedral Library, MS A. II. 1), is one of the masterpieces of twelfth-century English book production. The bishop was lord of one of England's most extensive estates, reaching from the Tweed to Lincolnshire, and including a palace in London. In 1183 du Puiset caused a detailed survey to be made of much of this lordship, especially the vills in what later became co. Durham and in Northumberland (Bedlingtonshire and Norhamshire), recording the numbers of unfree tenants with their rents and services, the universal royal tributes, such as cornage, which the bishop levied in place of the king, and the obligations of a handful of boroughs and freeholders, for example thegns and drengs. This important record is known as <span class="roman">Boldon Buke</span>, from a manor on the episcopal demesne taken to be typical, and survives in several manuscripts ranging in date from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticaldisputesandsecularpolitics"></a>Ecclesiastical disputes and secular politics</h2>It was entirely in character that du Puiset was engaged over many years in disputes with his own cathedral chapter, where his success in litigation stimulated the production by the priory's monks of numerous forgeries designed to demonstrate that earlier bishops had given them immunity from many episcopal demands. The bishop also quarrelled, from the later 1160s, with his own metropolitan, Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que. A fruitful source of conflict was the existence in York diocese of privileged estates such as Northallerton and Howden, which belonged to the bishops of Durham, and in Durham diocese of a similar estate (Hexhamshire) belonging to the archbishops of York. Such long-drawn-out disputes were a commonplace of twelfth-century ecclesiastical politics and in no way inhibited du Puiset from serving as a judge or investigator in numerous other legal conflicts, including the notoriously never-ending argument between Canterbury and York over the limits of their primatial and metropolitan privileges.<br>
<br>Another <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> in which du Puiset was involved arose from the unwise action of the cathedral chapter of St Andrews in electing Master John the Scot (<i>d</i>. 1203) as their bishop in 1178 in succession to Bishop Richard. Master John was a nephew of an earlier bishop, and as an experienced and educated clergyman might have been judged a suitable candidate. But William the Lion was determined to appoint his chaplain Hugh, and drove John the Scot and his supporter, the bishop of Aberdeen, into exile. The canons of St Andrews appealed to the papal curia, and since Bishop Hugh attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179 it was natural that he, along with Archbishop Roger of York, should have been commanded by the pope to bring the king of Scots to heel, if necessary by means of excommunication and interdict. Neither of the northern English prelates was allowed into Scotland, although Bishop Hugh met the king of Scots at Redden in August, 1181, and vainly argued the case for John the Scot. The dispute was settled in 1183, inevitably by a compromise. The bishop of Durham must have been well known to the officials of the papal curia, for apart from figuring frequently in litigation he had attended Alexander III's Council of Tours in 1163, the sole suffragan of York to be present in person.<br>
<br>The kings of Scots, Malcolm IV (<i>r</i>. 1153&#150;65) and especially William the Lion (<i>r</i>. 1165&#150;1214), were almost hereditary enemies, ever since the Scots had favoured Anjou against Blois in 1136. The building of Berwick Bridge is almost the sole instance of du Puiset's co-operation with the Scots, who saw his massive rebuilding of Norham Castle on the border in the 1160s as an act of provocation. Yet in the great rebellion instigated by Henry II's eldest son, Henry, the Young King, in 1173, the bishop of Durham displayed such caution in the face of King William's invasions of Northumbria in support of the rebels as to incur a suspicion of collusion and certainly the wrath of the English king. Not only did du Puiset enter into truces with the Scots that allowed their armies safe passage through the bishopric and were obviously designed to minimize the damage which Scottish raids might do to St Cuthbert's Land; but at one point, in the summer of 1174, the bishop's nephew and namesake, Hugues du Puiset, count of Bar, landed at Hartlepool at the head of a sizeable military force, ostensibly to defend the bishopric against rebel attacks but widely suspected of being du Puiset's contribution to the hoped-for overthrow of Henry II. Only the prompt surrender of the castles of Norham, Durham, and Northallerton and the payment of heavy fines could, after some interval of time, bring about a reconciliation between bishop and king. The same inclination to be neutral at times of major crisis had shown itself in the Becket dispute, where it has been said by David Knowles that for reasons that do not appear du Puiset kept entirely clear of the controversy, although he had collaborated with Archbishop Roger in the fatal coronation of the Young King on 14 June 1170. Between 1175 and the end of Henry II's reign relations between du Puiset and the king seem to have been reasonably harmonious. The bishop helped to settle the Galloway dispute in 1186, and two years later went to the Scottish border to demand that the Scots contribute to the &#145;Saladin tithe&#146; raised by Henry II throughout his dominions as his contribution to the campaign to recover Jerusalem for the Christians. Although the bishop negotiated with the Scots, King William's reply was that his barons flatly refused to pay the tithe; the Scottish contribution towards the third crusade came only after Richard I had succeeded his father, and was willing to give William the Lion his independence for a payment of 10,000 marks of silver.<h2>
<a name="Lastconflictsanddeath"></a>Last conflicts and death</h2>Du Puiset's greatest show of loyalty to the house of Anjou came in the first five years of Richard I's reign, and even there it may be argued that the bishop's motivation was essentially the enhancement of his own power and authority. Taking advantage of his own wealth and of the king's need for money, he was able to buy from Richard the wapentake of Sadberge&#151;the largest territory between Tees and Tyne not yet in episcopal hands&#151;and also the much prized earldom of Northumberland, hankered after for many years by the king of Scots. He also became joint justiciar of England, though this was reduced to a justiciarship of the north in 1190. Du Puiset was completely outmanoeuvred by the king's chancellor, William de Longchamp (<i>d</i>. 1197), who put the bishop under virtual house arrest at Howden in the summer of 1190 and stripped him of his offices. On Longchamp's fall the next year du Puiset made some recovery, but although he retained the earldom of Northumberland until 1194, he was now too elderly to get the better of such astute and persistent opponents as the king's brother and heir, John, count of Mortain, and their half-brother Geoffrey Plantagenet (<i>d</i>. 1212), who to the fury of du Puiset had been given the archbishopric of York in September 1189, following an election to which du Puiset formally objected. There ensued a most unseemly dispute, which involved not only the clergy and people of York but also the papacy and the regents governing for the king, now absent on his crusade. Eventually in the autumn of 1192 the bishop and his metropolitan (consecrated in August of the previous year) were formally reconciled. Nevertheless du Puiset's last two years were hardly peaceful. From the end of 1192 until early in 1194 the king was a prisoner in Austria and Germany. Against a background of John's treachery and the unremitting enmity of Philip of France, a huge ransom had to be raised in England to secure the king's release. Du Puiset's share in the events of this difficult time included a successful siege of John's castle at Tickhill and a payment of &pound;2000 towards Richard's ransom to escape having his cathedral plate and ornaments confiscated. The return of the king in March 1194 should have meant peace for the north of England and rewards for the bishop of Durham. But even in the atmosphere of rejoicing the bishop could not resist the temptation to insult King William of Scotland, gravely displeasing King Richard who was William's friend. Du Puiset was prompted to surrender the earldom of Northumberland, and although he had the satisfaction of seeing King William's demand for it refused, he never recovered it for himself. He died at Howden on 3 March 1195 aged about seventy.<br>
<br>The combination of a royal and princely family background and a position of immense wealth and potential power made this imperious and quarrelsome nobleman a major figure of the English, and indeed of the European, twelfth century. Tall, handsome, and&#151;when he chose to be&#151;affable, Hugh du Puiset was clearly capable of impressing his contemporaries with his personality. To judge from the witness lists of Henry II's <i>acta</i> he was often at court, especially at meetings of what may be called the great council. He took part in many weighty decisions affecting both secular and ecclesiastical politics. He was no scholar, still less a spiritual leader. For fifty years he was a force to be reckoned with in the life of northern England. Yet he is chiefly remembered in the great castles of Norham and Durham, and above all in the splendid Galilee Chapel which still adorns his cathedral.<br>
