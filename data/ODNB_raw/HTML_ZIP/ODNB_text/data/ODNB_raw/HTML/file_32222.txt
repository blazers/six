<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butterworth,  George Sainton Kaye</span>  (1885&#150;1916), <span class="occ">composer and folk dancer</span>, was born on 12 July 1885 at 16 Westbourne Square, Paddington, London, the only child of Sir Alexander Kaye Butterworth (1854&#150;1946), a solicitor and later general manager of the North Eastern Railway Company, and his wife, Julia Marguerite (1849&#150;1911), the daughter of George Wigan MD of Portishead, Somerset, and a professional soprano before her marriage. His first school was Aysgarth, Yorkshire, from which he entered Eton College as a king's scholar in 1899. He distinguished himself in the athletic and social dimensions of school life as well as in intellectual pursuits; early promise in music was nurtured through study with Charles Lloyd and Thomas Dunhill at Eton, as well as with Christian Padel in York. From 1904 to 1908 he was in residence at Trinity College, Oxford; he took a third class in the honour school of <i>literae humaniores</i> and was active in musical circles, holding the presidency of the university musical club from October 1906 to March 1907.<br>
<br>By the time he left Oxford, Butterworth had abandoned plans for a career in the law, and the subsequent years were restless for him. He worked for a short while as a music critic for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and as a writer also contributed articles on the composers York Bowen, Henry Balfour Gardiner, and his teacher Dunhill to the second edition of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1904&#150;10). In 1909 he accepted a teaching post at Radley College but the following year returned to London, and from October 1910 to November 1911 he was enrolled at the Royal College of Music, where he studied the organ with Sir Walter Parratt, the piano with Herbert Sharpe, and theory and composition with Charles Wood.<br>
<br>The most powerful stimulus to Butterworth's artistic development came not from academic study, however, but from two quite different sources: his involvement with the &#145;rescue&#146; and revival of English folk-music and folk-dance gathering pace at the time, and his intimate friendship with a leading figure of this movement, Ralph Vaughan Williams, both of which had begun in his Oxford days. Butterworth became a major worker in the field, collecting more than 450 items, including songs, dance tunes, and dances; in 1906 he joined the Folk-Song Society, and he was a prominent figure in the English Folk-Dance Society, of which he was one of the founders in 1911, as well as a member of its original morris-dance side or team. An accomplished and passionate devotee of folk-dance, he once declared, &#145;I'm not a musician, I'm a professional dancer&#146;  (Barlow, 91). Folk-dancing appears to have been the one activity in which he felt completely assured and fulfilled, and which to some extent knit together the disparate threads of his life up to this point (film of Butterworth dancing survives). He collected and arranged an album of Sussex folk-songs and, in collaboration with Cecil Sharp, published several books of country and morris dances. The friendship with Vaughan Williams encompassed many shared ideals; they admired each other's music, and Butterworth provided both moral and practical support in the composition, performance, and reception of the older man's <span class="italic">London Symphony</span> (first performed 1914), which was dedicated to Butterworth's memory on its publication in 1920. At his death Butterworth left the majority of his manuscripts to Vaughan Williams.<br>
<br>Butterworth's surviving oeuvre of original compositions dates mostly from the period 1910&#150;14. It is small but distinctive and finely honed, and its core has established a firm hold in the repertory, at least in Britain. (His actual output was larger: a number of works, including songs, piano pieces, and some early chamber music, appear to have been destroyed by the composer in 1915.) It comprises eighteen songs (the majority to words from A. E. Housman's <span class="italic">A Shropshire Lad</span>, the remainder settings of W. E. Henley, R. L. Stevenson, P. B. Shelley, and Oscar Wilde), three short choral pieces, a suite for string quartet (unpublished), and four orchestral pieces, three of which are idylls partially based on folk-song material, and the fourth a rhapsody thematically connected with two of the <span class="italic">Shropshire Lad</span> songs. The assimilation of folk-song (in this Vaughan Williams's influence was crucial) is the key to a style that is simple and restrained, yet which distils deep passions that may on occasion emerge with force; folk-song suggested how basic melodic and harmonic vocabulary could be freed from a nineteenth-century tonal syntax (and attendant expressive ethos) that seemed exhausted and blandly cosmopolitan to many composers of the era. The <span class="italic">Rhapsody: a Shropshire Lad</span> (first performed under Arthur Nikisch at the Leeds festival of 1913) demonstrates impressively that Butterworth was developing both the capability of working on a larger scale without stylistic strain or contrivance and an individual handling of orchestral resources (even if the imprints of Elgar and Sibelius, in addition to Vaughan Williams, can be felt at times).<br>
<br>An unidentified colleague at Radley summed up Butterworth's character in terms echoed closely by other contemporaries:<blockquote>He had strength of character, opinions and the courage of them, a rugged directness of manner coupled with a gift of keen criticism and an absence of heroics. Few men can have been worse at making an acquaintance or better at keeping a friend. (Butterworth, 11)</blockquote>Whether any of Butterworth's friendships were more than platonic is uncertain; although he seems generally to have preferred the company of men, his sexual orientation remains unclear. His modesty, kindness, and natural gifts of leadership were commented on as early as his prep school days. He was a good-looking man, of medium height and build, dark-haired and with the full moustache fashionable in his day, and the most notable feature of his face in photographs is the sensitive and humorous cast of the eyes.<br>
<br>In many respects Butterworth emerges as an almost perfect example of a certain kind of Englishman of his generation&#151;he loved cricket, for instance, as well as country life in general&#151;and the reception of his music has also been dominated by its identification with a ruralist and often elegiac vision of &#145;Englishness&#146;. Such associations were sealed by the composer's distinguished conduct and sudden death in the First World War; as an example of youthful promise cut short he is the most important musical counterpart of a war poet such as Rupert Brooke (although he did not compose during the conflict). He enlisted on the outbreak of war in August 1914 and was subsequently commissioned in the 13th Durham light infantry. In France in 1916 he took charge of his company after the commanding officer was wounded; during that summer he was three times recommended for, and was twice awarded, the Military Cross. The second decoration honoured conduct on the morning of his death, 5 August 1916; he was killed by a bullet through the head at Pozi&egrave;res during the first battle of the Somme. He was buried on the front line; no grave marking survives, but his name appears on the Thiepval memorial close by, and a trench was named after him.<br>
