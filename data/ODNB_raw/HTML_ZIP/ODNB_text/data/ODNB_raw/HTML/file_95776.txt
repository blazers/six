<span class="headword">Stewart,  Lorn Alastair <span class="st"> [Johnnie]</span></span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">television producer</span>, was born at 3 Yardley Park Road, Tonbridge, Kent, on 7 November 1917, the only son of Haldane Campbell Stewart (1868&#150;1942), director of music at Tonbridge School, and later choirmaster and organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, and his wife, Elinor Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunt. His elder sister Jean Stewart (1914&#150;2002) was a distinguished viola player. As a young boy he learned to play the piano, and in 1937, after leaving school, he joined the sound effects department of BBC radio drama. During the Second World War he served as a wireless operator in the Middle East and worked in intelligence. On demobilization he returned to the BBC, initially as a programme engineer. On 6 April 1946 he married Sheila Mary Williamson, the 24-year-old daughter of Frank Williamson, shipbroker. They had a daughter, Judith. The marriage later ended in divorce.<br>
<br>At the BBC Stewart progressed up the hierarchy and was able to indulge his interest in new music. He produced music programmes that included <span class="italic">Sing It Again</span> and <span class="italic">BBC Jazz Club</span>, and secured Frank Sinatra for Cyril Stapleton's <span class="italic">Show Band Show</span> for a mere &pound;50. In 1958 he transferred to BBC Television and produced <span class="italic">Juke Box Jury</span>, hosted by David Jacobs. The disc jockey Jimmy Savile hosted the popular <span class="italic">Teen and Twenty Disc Club</span> on Radio Luxembourg, and in 1963 the BBC producer Barney Colehan recorded a pilot for television. After discussion it became a chart show, produced by Johnnie Stewart, who named it <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span>. The first programme was broadcast on new year's day 1964, with Savile as host. Because of the explosion of British beat groups, the charts were filled with home product and Stewart was confident of success.<br>
<br>At first <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> was broadcast from a converted church in Dickinson Road, Manchester. For three years Stewart used four presenters, alternating Savile, Alan Freeman, Pete Murray, and David Jacobs. Stewart devised simple rules: the programme would always end with the number one record, which was the only record that could be repeated from the previous week. He included the highest new entry and the highest climber and nothing going down was included. Quality was not the issue: the record-buyers determined the content, although Stewart did include a &#145;Tip for the Top&#146;. Stewart's only mistake was not to archive all the programmes. Harry Goodwin's still photographs were used in the chart rundowns, and he shot the silhouette of Stewart that ended each programme, though many assumed that the still was of Billy Fury. The programme was screened at peak time and, although aimed at the young, it attracted a family audience spanning the generations. In a brilliant move Stewart created a popular female dance troupe, which became Pan's People. The audience was also an important ingredient of <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span>. The hysterical screaming was genuine. As Stewart put it, &#145;<span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> was the simplest show in the world and also pure murder on the ears&#146;  (<span class="italic">Music Week</span>, 28 Jan 1995). Initially all records were mimed. The Musicians' Union felt that asking artists to mime was depriving their members of work, but Stewart argued that many acts could not create the same sound live. In the end Johnny Pearson formed a Top of the Pops orchestra with experienced session musicians.<br>
<br>Stewart sometimes felt antipathy towards the music he was promoting. In 1965, after the Small Faces had appeared on <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span>, Stewart thanked them politely. Their leader, Steve Marriott, felt insulted by Stewart's patronizing comments, and as a consequence of Marriott's rude response Stewart broke his own rules so that the Small Faces could never play <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> again. Presenting the show from Manchester created problems as many of the bigger acts did not want to travel. In 1967 <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> moved to the Lime Grove Studios in west London. The new presenters included Stuart Henry, &#145;Emperor&#146; Rosko, Simon Dee, and Kenny Everett, who were all connected with BBC Radio 1. John Peel made such a mess of presenting a programme in 1968 that Stewart told him he would never work on TV again. Later, after Stewart had moved on, Peel proved to be a witty and sardonic host. Stewart started the <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> review of the year, the first of which was broadcast before the queen's speech on Christmas day 1967. He also produced Alan Freeman's magazine show <span class="italic">All Systems Freeman</span>.<br>
<br>Stewart was given a year's sabbatical in 1971 and went to North America. His set designer, Stanley Dorfman, took over as producer of <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> and amended Stewart's rules, adding an LP spot, which one week included a ten-minute piece by Yes. Stewart returned and reinstated the original concept. His return coincided with another wave of home-grown British talent, with the &#145;glam rock&#146; of Slade and T. Rex doing well. The presenters now included Noel Edmonds, Dave Lee Travis, and Tony Blackburn.<br>
<br>Stewart left <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> in 1974. In 1978 he produced the pop quiz <span class="italic">Cheggers Plays Pop</span> with Keith Chegwin. He then worked in South Africa on a local version of <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span>. He retired to Ibiza but returned to the UK when his health deteriorated, living latterly at Dorrington House residential nursing home, Quebec Road, Dereham, Norfolk. He died there on 30 April 2005 of bronchopneumonia and severe peripheral vascular disease. He was survived by his daughter, Judith. <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> outlived him, finally being taken off the air in 2006.<br>
