<span class="headword">Smith,  Martin Roger  Seymour-</span>  (1928&#150;1998), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 24 April 1928 at Tudor House, Newington Green, Islington, London, the only child of Frank Sidney Seymour Smith (1900&#150;1972), a librarian and bibliographer, and his wife, Marjorie Nellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (1901&#150;1988), who wrote poetry under the pseudonym of Elena Fearn. As a teenage boy at Highgate School with a passion for poetry, Seymour-Smith made a pilgrimage to visit Robert Graves, who received him kindly. Despite the difference in their ages, Graves became a lifelong friend to Seymour-Smith and a dominant influence on his writing. After military service in Egypt Seymour-Smith went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford; he emerged with a poor degree in history but with a reputation as a poet who had published a pamphlet in the <span class="roman">Fantasy Poets</span> series, which was to include some famous names. After graduating Seymour-Smith and his girlfriend, Janet de Glanville, were invited to Mallorca by Graves on a double assignment; he was to act as tutor to Graves's son, and she, a Somerville classics graduate, was to assist Graves with translations for <span class="italic">The Greek Myths</span>, on which he was then working. The couple were married at the British consulate at Palma de Mallorca on 6 September 1952. Graves was one of the witnesses.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_71004"></a><span class="headword">Janet  Seymour-Smith</span>  (1930&#150;1998), <span class="occ">translator and scholar</span>, was a tall blonde woman of striking appearance but retiring personality. She was born on 25 August 1930 at Eastnor, Rolle Road, Littleham, Exmouth, Devon, the daughter of Lionel Richard Gethin de Glanville, a doctor, and his wife, Hilda St Hilary Edith Everard, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mayne. Apart from her work for Graves, she was an active supporter of and collaborator in her husband's later literary activities. After her death, their friend Robert Nye wrote, &#145;Her mind was his mind in such matters. And what a mind it was&#151;as incandescent as it was delicate and particular&#146;  (Nye, <span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Their first child was born on Mallorca; a second daughter was born in England. The American poet Robert Creeley, who knew Seymour-Smith on Mallorca, depicted him as Artie in his autobiographical novel <span class="italic">The Island</span>: &#145;In the night he thought of Artie, tired, worn, smiling man. The shuffling gesture, the sidewise manner, the edged, confidential voice&#146;  (Creeley, 59). The impression seems authentic to those who knew Seymour-Smith at that time. In Mallorca Creeley set up the Divers Press, which published Seymour-Smith's <span class="italic">All Devils Fading</span> in 1954 (though dated 1953), an elegant hand-printed collection of eleven poems. Graves's influence is strong in themes and idiom, though not to the extent of extinguishing Seymour-Smith's personal poetic voice; it was to remain strong in the later poetry, where it is combined with that of Hardy, whom Seymour-Smith regarded as the greatest of twentieth-century poets. Like Graves, Seymour-Smith saw human relations in mythic terms, where the beloved woman is both muse and tormentor. His poetry, from the first collection onwards, is peopled by ghosts, devils, revenants, doppelg&auml;ngers. The eponymous female figures of his second and third collections, <span class="italic">Tea with Miss Stockport</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Norma</span> (1970), embody the duality of love and suffering. Like Graves, Seymour-Smith was a poet of formal precision and a delicate, occasionally exquisite, music. But his poetry was often obscure, perhaps because of the pressure of emotions that evaded direct expression. In his last collection, <span class="italic">Wilderness</span> (1994), there are poems of more direct feeling, such as &#145;To my wife in hospital&#146; and &#145;To my daughter&#146;. Seymour-Smith wanted to be seen primarily as a poet; in 1970 he wrote, &#145;all my critical work stems primarily from poetic experience, and from what I describe as poetic thinking&#146;  (Murphy, 982). But his poetry remained a thin stream compared to the vast output of his prose writing.<br>
<br>After Seymour-Smith and his family returned to England in 1954 he worked for a time as a schoolmaster, an unhappy phase of his life reflected in the satirical poem &#145;What schoolmasters say&#146;, which Philip Larkin included in the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Twentieth Century Verse</span>. In 1960 he became a professional writer. He brought out a variety of potboiling or educational texts, and a scholarly edition of Shakespeare's sonnets; he was also a prolific reviewer. His most substantial contribution to literary study lies in his long biographies and reference books. He published a life of his mentor Robert Graves, which had the benefit of close personal knowledge; of Kipling, which annoyed many readers by implying that he was a repressed homosexual; and of Hardy, whom Seymour-Smith revered, though he devoted too much space to attacking other Hardy biographers. He was always a combative writer, much given to airing his opinions on all sorts of subjects, but his direct and personal style made him irresistibly readable, even when provoking disagreement.<br>
<br>Seymour-Smith's largest and most ambitious book is <span class="italic">The Guide to Modern World Literature</span>; the first edition, published in 1973, was big, but the greatly enlarged second edition of 1985 was enormous, running to nearly 1400 pages. It is a rewarding book to dip into, and informative to read in at length, but it has puzzling aspects. Could Seymour-Smith have read all the works he discusses, from thirty-odd literatures? Robert Nye acknowledges that he had not and that some of the entries were written by his wife, Janet  (Nye, <span class="italic">The Independent</span>). The blurb of the 1985 edition says Seymour-Smith had a reading knowledge of some twenty languages; if he had, it may be wondered how and when he acquired this remarkable capacity in a busy life. Certainly there are translations from Hungarian, Polish, and modern Greek poets which appear to be by the author himself, and he can happily be given the benefit of the doubt. But Seymour-Smith was a joker and not everything in the guide is to be taken at face value, such as the reference to the Polish philosopher and novelist &#145;Herma Newticks&#146;, who was allegedly responsible for the propagation of &#145;hermeneutics&#146; as a critical concept.<br>
<br>Anyone who had read so much literature as Seymour-Smith, and wrote so extensively about it, might be expected to work in a university. But he was a proud, late upholder of the old Grub Street tradition, who never let slip an opportunity to cross swords with academics. Robert Nye described him as &#145;small and wiry, bright-eyed, bushy-bearded&#146;; on his own admission he was &#145;angry as a bull when roused&#146;  (Nye, &#145;Martin Seymour-Smith&#146;, 13). But he had a gentle side, shown in his love of his cats, whom he named after characters in Hardy's novels. He died at his home, 36 Holliers Hill, in Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, of a sudden heart attack on 1 July 1998, and was cremated at Eastbourne on 10 July. Janet Seymour-Smith survived him for only two months. She died on 2 September 1998 at the Kent and Sussex Hospital, Tunbridge Wells, and was cremated at Tunbridge Wells on 11 September.<br>
