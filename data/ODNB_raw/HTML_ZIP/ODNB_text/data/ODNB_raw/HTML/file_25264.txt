<span class="headword">Shaw,  Peter</span>  (1694&#150;1763), <span class="occ">physician and author</span>, was born in March 1694 in Lichfield, Staffordshire, the youngest of the four children of Robert Shaw (<i>c</i>.1650&#150;1704), master of Lichfield grammar school, and his wife, Ann (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1658). He was baptized in St Mary's Church, Lichfield, on 9 April 1694. Nothing is known of his education, though he evidently acquired competence in Latin and studied medicine, perhaps at a foreign university. When in the early 1720s he embarked on a career in London as an author and translator of medical works, he styled himself MD.<br>
<br>Shaw's first two publications, both of which appeared in 1723, were <span class="italic">A Treatise of Incurable Diseases</span> and an edition of the <span class="italic">Praelectiones pharmaceuticae</span> by the apothecary John Quincy. The following year, the anonymous work <span class="italic">The Juice of the Grape</span> was ascribed to him. His <span class="italic">New Practice of Physic</span> (1726) comprised a catalogue of diseases with diagnostic signs, prognoses, and the appropriate regimen for each, said to be drawn from the practice of the leading physicians of London; the book was remarkably successful, reaching a seventh edition in 1753. Shaw also turned his talents to editing and translating the works of prominent scientific writers. He produced an abridged and &#145;methodized&#146; edition of <span class="italic">The Philosophical Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle</span> (3 vols., 1725), and, later, <span class="italic">The Philosophical Works of Francis Bacon</span> (3 vols., 1733). He pioneered the introduction into England of continental works on chemistry, collaborating with the encyclopaedia writer Ephraim Chambers to bring out <span class="italic">New Method of Chemistry</span> (1727), a translation of a work by Herman Boerhaave. This translation was prepared from a French edition, unauthorized by the author, and from student notes of Boerhaave's lectures at Leiden. Shaw added extensive footnotes, comparing Boerhaave's doctrines with those of Newton and his English followers. In 1730 he produced a digest of the Jena lectures of Georg Ernst Stahl, <span class="italic">Philosophical Principles of Universal Chemistry</span>.<br>
<br>Shaw followed these publications with works of his own, designed to encourage the development of chemistry as a science of potentially widespread utility. His <span class="italic">Three Essays in Artificial Philosophy or Universal Chemistry</span> (1731) directed attention particularly to the distillation and fermentation of liquors. With the instrument maker Francis Hauksbee the younger, Shaw published, in 1731, <span class="italic">Proposals for a Course of Chemical Experiments</span> and <span class="italic">An Essay for Introducing a Portable Laboratory</span>. The latter was accompanied by the offer for sale of a new design for a portable chemical furnace. The same year, Shaw embarked on a series of lectures on chemistry and its applications, delivered in London in 1731 and 1732, and in Scarborough the following year. His <span class="italic">Chemical Lectures</span> was published in 1734.<br>
<br>In 1733 Shaw moved from London to Scarborough, where he found a fashionable audience for his lectures among visitors to the spa. He entered into collaboration with a Scarborough apothecary, Culmer Cockerill, and the London booksellers Ward and Chandler, to promote the medical benefits of the waters. Having already published <span class="italic">New Experiments and Observations upon Mineral Waters</span> (1731), a translation of a work by Friedrich Hoffman, Shaw followed up with his own <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Contents, Virtues, and Uses of the Scarborough Spaw-Waters</span> (1734), and the anonymous <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Contents, Virtues, and Uses of Cold and Hot Mineral Springs</span> (1735). About this time, he married Frances Tidmarsh (1700&#150;1768), the widow of Richard Tidmarsh and daughter of John Hyde of Sundridge, Kent. The couple had four children, Jane, Peter, Elizabeth, who married the physician Richard Warren, and Margaret.<br>
<br>Shaw's popularity among the fashionable nobility and gentry in Scarborough enabled him to develop a successful career in medical practice, which displaced authorship as his primary occupation. He benefited from a growing reputation as a doctor, and his connections with prominent society figures and physicians proved valuable when he moved back to London in 1738. The same year, he defended the controversial claims of Joanna Stephens to have discovered an effective medicine for dissolving urinary calculi. Shaw published an <span class="italic">Examination of the Reasons for and Against the Subscription for a Medicament for the Stone</span> and <span class="italic">Inquiries on the Nature of Miss Stephens's Medicaments</span>, both in 1738. Having been summoned in 1739 by the censor's board of the Royal College of Physicians for practising without a licence in the capital, Shaw became a licentiate of the college in 1740, and subsequently (in 1754) a fellow. The patronage of Sir Edward Hulse, a court physician, and later physician to the duke of Newcastle, aided Shaw's rise to a prominent position in the medical profession. In 1751 he was granted an MD degree from Cambridge University by royal mandate, and he became a fellow of the Royal Society the following year. In 1753 he was appointed physician-extraordinary and later physician-in-ordinary to George II, and regularly accompanied the king on his visits to Hanover. He also attended the duke of Newcastle and his family, and the duke of Grafton. On the accession of George III, in 1760, he was confirmed as physician-in-ordinary to the new monarch.<br>
<br>Shaw died in London on 15 March 1763. His wife survived him. He was buried in the nave of Wimbledon church, where there is an inscription to his memory. Shaw's son-in-law, Richard Warren, spoke warmly of him in his Harveian oration of 1768.<br>
