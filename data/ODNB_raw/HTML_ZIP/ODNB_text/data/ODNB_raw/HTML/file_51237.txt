<span class="headword">Mander,  Raymond Josiah Gale <span class="st"> [Ray]</span></span>  (1911&#150;1983), <span class="occ">actor and theatre historian</span>, was born at 6B Cato Road, Clapham, London, on 15 July 1911, the only son of Albert Edwin Mander, architect and surveyor, and his wife, Edith Christina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gale. Albert Mander was related to the film director Miles Mander, but there seems to have been no family connection to inspire Ray Mander's passion for labelling items around the family home, thought at one stage to destine him for a career as a museum curator. Instead, after being educated at Battersea grammar school and perhaps inspired by the bundle of Irving theatre programmes given to him on his seventh birthday, he became an actor when he left school, touring in weekly repertory.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51237"></a><span class="headword">(Francis) Joseph Blackett <span class="st"> [Joe]</span> Mitchenson</span>  (1911&#150;1992), <span class="occ">actor and theatre historian</span>, was born at 53 Selborne Road, Southgate, London, on 4 October 1911, the only son of Francis William Mitchenson, general merchant and drama critic, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roddam. Mitchenson's father's ancestors had strong theatre connections and his mother (who had Yorkshire family connections) was theatre crazy and an amateur actress. The parents' marriage was not a success and Francis Mitchenson soon disappeared from the scene. Joe Mitchenson was educated privately, and from the age of eight, with financial support from a relative, took dancing classes at the Fay Compton School of Dance. Five years later he decided that his interest was in acting, no doubt influenced by contact with theatricals encountered at a fashionable vegetarian restaurant to which he was frequently taken by his mother after dancing classes. His first experience of the West End came in 1934 when he walked on in <span class="italic">Libel</span> at the Playhouse (with Alec Guinness similarly engaged).<br>
<br>14 February 1939 saw the first meeting between Mander and Mitchenson, and later in the year they appeared together in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Mitchenson playing Fenton and Mander playing Page. They toured the provinces for the rest of the year, with Mander playing Guildenstern among other roles in the Harold V. Neilson company at the Opera House, Manchester, until the Benson tradition ended just before the outbreak of the Second World War. Mander and Mitchenson then followed separate paths during the war. Mander found employment as a pioneer disc jockey for the BBC with thirty-five programmes to his credit, despite the inclusion on one occasion of banned Strauss music. Mitchenson meanwhile joined the Royal Horse Artillery and then transferred to the infantry before being invalided out with a leg injury, which continued to trouble him in later life.<br>
<br>At the end of the war the two friends decided to turn their common interest into something more, and gradually the Mander and Mitchenson Theatre Collection was born, housed in Mitchenson's mother's house in Sydenham, London. Over the years this tall Victorian terraced house at 5 Venner Road overflowed with an amazing treasure trove of playbills and books from seventeenth-century folios onwards, programmes, periodicals, gramophone records, playwrights' prompt scripts, drawings, designs, and china figurines of great actors and actresses in their most famous roles, including a Bloor Derby Garrick. Anything which narrated theatre history was avidly acquired, magpie fashion.<br>
<br>Soon the passion for collecting took over from acting, although Mitchenson continued to make the occasional &#145;professional&#146; appearance in later life&#151;probably the last was with Coral Browne on television in <span class="italic">Caviar for the General</span>. Working together, Mander and Mitchenson established themselves as the source for any authoritative theatrical information, willingly dispensing this to actors with whom they had personal connections (Judi Dench was a particular friend and later a patron of the collection's charity) and managements alike. They provided material for journals, television programmes&#151;<span class="italic">This is your Life</span> was a consistent customer&#151;and innumerable exhibitions&#151;among which was one to Soviet Russia in 1978 of theatre design for the British Council.<br>
<br>It was a natural step for Mander and Mitchenson to use their acquired knowledge as the source for publications, and between 1952 and 1977 seventeen books were written or compiled by them, besides contributions to more than 400 other publications. Their own publications ranged from pictorial histories of British theatre (1957), of opera (1959), of Gilbert and Sullivan (1962), of musical comedy (1969), of revue (1971), and of pantomime (1973), to more narrative accounts&#151;including <span class="italic">Hamlet through the Ages</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The Gay Twenties</span> (1958), <span class="italic">The Turbulent Thirties</span> (1960), and the theatrical companions to Maugham (1955), Coward (1957), and Wagner (1977)&#151;and the authoritative records of London's theatres themselves, <span class="italic">Theatres of London</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">Lost Theatres of London</span> (1968).<br>
<br>In the 1960s and 1970s &#145;Ray and Joe&#146; became a theatrical institution and, dressed in style, invariably held court at first nights, reflecting on previous productions and associated gossip. At Venner Road they dispensed knowledge to those fortunate enough to be invited there&#151;it was a private collection&#151;or to those who could brave a telephone conversation which was always a double act. Noel Coward aptly named them Gog and Magog, quipping &#145;sort out between yourselves which is which&#146;  (private information). Indeed many of their friends secretly found it difficult to distinguish Mander (with the air of a former pugilist and speedy verbal delivery) and Mitchenson (taller, with long silver hair).<br>
<br>Mander and Mitchenson knew from their personal experience of rescuing theatrical records from oblivion (as when they purchased the watercolour poster by Dudley Hardy for Kitty Grey from its use as temporary shop window repair following bomb damage) or when they failed (as with drawings in the Saville Theatre's bar), how easily theatre history might be lost. They first suggested as early as 1944 that their collection might be bequeathed to the nation. Sybil Thorndike aptly summed up their importance with her description of those the profession affectionately knew as &#145;The Boys&#146; as &#145;our passport to posterity&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Initially Mander and Mitchenson hoped that their collection would find a home in the National Theatre on the South Bank, but reasons of space forced rethinking. For a time it seemed that the collection would find a permanent home in the eighteenth-century Beckenham Place Park, with support from Lewisham council (which at one stage had sought to acquire the Venner Road property for road widening). The collection moved there in 1983, but despite support from the Greater London council in its final days the cost of renovating the Beckenham property proved too much for the charitable trust to which Mander and Mitchenson had made over the collection in 1977 (although both retained a hands-on approach to its work, sometimes to the concern of its curators). In 2001, after a brief period in temporary accommodation, it moved to a new home as part of the Jerwood Library of the Performing Arts in the Hawksmoor building at the Trinity College of Music, Old Royal Naval College, in Greenwich. There, while still retaining its independent status and within an academic environment which might have surprised its founders, it was located in a worthy surrounding and atmosphere appropriate for Mander and Mitchenson's life work.<br>
<br>Mander died at Hither Green Hospital, Lewisham, London, on 20 December 1983, of bronchopneumonia and emphysema, when the move to Beckenham Place had only just begun. Mitchenson moved with the collection to Beckenham and lived there until shortly before he died in Orpington Hospital, Bromley, London, on 7 October 1992, of renal failure and prostatic hypertrophy.<br>
