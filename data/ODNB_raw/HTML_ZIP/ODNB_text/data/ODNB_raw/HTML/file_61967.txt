<span class="headword">Harries,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1785&#150;1839), <span class="occ">astrologer and physician</span>, was born possibly at Pant-Coi, Cwrtycadno, Carmarthenshire, the eldest son of Henry Jones Harries (1739&#150;1805), and his wife, Mary Wilkins. He was educated until he was ten years old at The Cowings, Commercial Private Academy, Caeo, and then boarded at Haverfordwest grammar school until he was eighteen; when his father died in 1805 he inherited the estate of Cwrtycadno.<br>
<br>It is not known where Harries studied medicine, but he later established a practice in Harley Street, London, with his astrologer friend Robert Cross Smith 
    (alias Raphael; 1795&#150;1832)
  , before returning to Caeo to establish a practice there when he was in his forties. He was certainly a popular physician with a large practice:<blockquote>The sick and sorrowful came to enquire of his oracles from all parts of Wales, and from the testimony of the oldest people in the district, he was eminently successful in his cures. Lunatics were brought to him from parts of Pembrokeshire and Radnorshire, and he had a wonderful power over them. The course of treatment would include what he would term the water treatment, the herbs treatment, and the bleeding treatment. One of his chief methods was, he would take the afflicted to the brink of the river, and fire an old flint revolver; this would frighten his patient to such a degree that he would fall into the pool. He assumed the power of charming away pain, and was so successful that people believed thoroughly that he was in league with the evil one. (Price, 54)</blockquote>Harries has been described as being 6 feet 2 inches tall, and well built in middle age, with &#145;Short dark hair &hellip; Mutton-chops sideboards. Medium sized forehead. Very straight nose. Mouth wide, slight jaws. At 53 years of age, beginning of a double chin. Blue, wistful thinking eyes&#146;  (Vaughan-Poppy, 4). It has been claimed that he married Elizabeth Emily Lewis, a lawyer's daughter from Fishguard. However, a marriage licence for 8 August 1821, records that John Harries, surgeon, and significantly a bachelor of Caeo parish, was married to a Lettice Rees.<br>
<br>Their son <a name="cosubject_72299"></a><span class="headword">Henry Harries</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1821, <em>d.</em> 1849)<span class="occ"></span>, it has been suggested, was born on 30 June 1816, though the Caeo parish baptismal entry for Harry, the eldest son of John and Lettice Harries of Pant-Coi, was recorded on 7 November 1821. He was described in later life as having &#145;a pale face, very dark hair, hanging down in ringlets over his narrow shoulders, grey eyes, and a very high narrow forehead &hellip;. His health was very delicate, owing to a weak chest&#146;  (Price, 56). Henry followed his father's footsteps and was educated at The Cowings and at Haverfordwest grammar school before attending London University. Between 1839 and 1842 Henry lived with his mother at Aberd&acirc;r, a house on their estate, while Pant-Coi was being rebuilt. During this period he met Hannah Marsden, a teacher at Caeo, and the daughter of a workman on the Pant-Coi estate, and on 4 November 1842 they were married at Caeo church. The marriage, however, was viewed with horror by Henry's family as it was felt that he had married beneath his social status, and allegedly the marriage turned out to be an unhappy one. Harries nevertheless accepted his fate and stated, &#145;I cannot help it. I must marry her. I dare not cross my planet&#146;  (NL Wales, MS 11119B). They had three children: Victoria Letitia, born in March 1843; John, born in March 1844; and Henry Harri Harries, born in April 1846.<br>
<br>Although the Harries family were recognized as doctors, they gained notoriety with their ability to predict future events, recover lost or stolen property, fight witchcraft, and invoke benign spirits. Henry Harries issued the following proclamation shortly before his father's death describing his work as that of a Dyn Hysbys (&#145;cunning man&#146;) in Carmarthenshire. He suggested that he could, without seeing the person, determine:<blockquote>Temper, disposition, fortunate or unfortunate in their general pursuits, honour, riches, journeys and voyages (success therein, and what places best to travel in or reside in), friends and enemies, trade or profession best to follow, and whether fortunate in speculation, viz: lottery, dealing in foreign markets, etc.<br>
<br>Of marriage, if to marry. The description, temper, disposition of the person, rich or poor, happy or unhappy in marriage, etc.<br>
<br>Of children, whether fortunate or not, etc., deduced from the influence of the sun and moon, with the planetary orbs at the time of birth.<br>
<br>Also judgement and general use in sickness and disease, etc. (Price, 56)</blockquote>Tales of supernatural events involving both father and son have long found their way into Welsh folklore and are quite numerous and varied. One of the most famous incidents involving John Harries concerned the disappearance of a local girl and the recovery of her body at Maesyronnen&#151;the precise location where Harries had informed the police that they would find the corpse of the young girl who had been murdered by her boyfriend. This led to Harries being charged as an accessory to the crime and the penning of a popular verse:<blockquote>
<div>Awn yn alarus<br>
</div>
<div>At Doctor Harries<br>
</div>
<div>Am ei fod yn hysbys,<br>
</div>
<div>I 'mofyn hanes hon;<br>
</div>
<div>Dywedai ei bod yn gorwedd<br>
</div>
<div>Gerllaw Maes yr on;<br>
</div>
<div>Mae ceu-bren mawr o wenwyn<br>
</div>
<div>Yn tyfu bwys y lle,<br>
</div>
<div>A nant yn rhedeg heibio<br>
</div>
<div>Lle'i lladdwyd ganddo fe.<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>We go concerned<br>
</div>
<div>To Doctor Harries<br>
</div>
<div>Because he is &#145;Hysbys&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>To ask her history;<br>
</div>
<div>He said that she was lying<br>
</div>
<div>Near Maes yr on;<br>
</div>
<div>There is a tree full of bees<br>
</div>
<div>Growing by the place,<br>
</div>
<div>And a stream runs near<br>
</div>
<div>Where she was murdered by him.<br>
</div> (NL Wales, MS 11119B and translation)</blockquote>The details of the case were passed on to Llwyd Glansefin and Gwyn Glan Bran, two magistrates at Llandovery, who called Harries before them and accused him of the crime. Harries was prepared to demonstrate his talent for second sight as part of his defence by suggesting to the magistrates &#145;Dywedwch chwi yr awr y daethoch chwi i'r byd, Mi ddywedaf finnau yr awr yr ewch chwi allan ohono&#146; (&#145;You tell me which hour you came into the world, and I will tell you the hour you will depart from it&#146;; Bosse-Griffiths, 16). The two magistrates not wishing to pursue this line of questioning and possibly unwilling to know their fate proceeded to set Harries free.<br>
<br>Aspects of the supernatural involving both John and Henry Harries have underlined the importance of these men in Welsh folklore. In the Cwrtycadno collection (Pantcoy MSS) at the National Library of Wales there are various personal items, particularly astrological data, medical ledgers, and a book of incantations, which showed how the Dyn Hybsys could &#145;obtain the Familiar of the Genius or Good Spirit and cause him to appear&#146;  (J. C. Davies, &#145;Ghost-raising&#146;, 328). There are a considerable number of other tales which concern the Harrieses, notably the recovery of lost cows on Carmarthen Bridge and wedding rings, and the punishments meted out to people who had committed an act of ill will. John Harries died on 11 May 1839 aged fifty-four in a fire which also destroyed the family home at Pant-Coi, and on 13 May he was buried at Caeo churchyard. The character of his death, however, was unusual. He had a premonition that he would die by accident on 11 May 1839 and to avoid this happening he stayed in bed throughout the day. During the night, he was awoken by people crying out that the house was on fire. In his haste to dowse the flames he slipped from the ladder he was standing on and was killed. Henry Harries died aged twenty-eight from consumption, on 16 June 1849, and was buried three days later.<br>
<br>Other family members also had some ability in predicting the future as &#145;there was also a daughter who was rather clever in the &#147;art&#148;&#146;, as well as John Harries, who &#145;dabbled in it but never shone&#146;  (NL Wales, MS 11119B). These are probably references to Anne and John, the daughter and son or grandson of John Harries. The following letter from J. Williams of The Court, Brecon, on 21 March 1863, addressed to John Harries, shows the continuing role of the Harries family in Welsh social life:<blockquote>I have written to ask if you would oblige me by ruling my planet. I have long had a wish to have it done and when I heard of your truly wonderful gift I determined to write. I wish to know something relating to my marriage and particular friends. (NL Wales, MS 11717B)</blockquote>This was certainly not an isolated case, as the fame of Cwrtycadno spread quickly throughout Wales and led to a number of distinguished visitors. These included the actress Sarah Siddons and her colleagues, and the writer George Borrow, who spent a day at Pant-Coi in 1854.<br>
