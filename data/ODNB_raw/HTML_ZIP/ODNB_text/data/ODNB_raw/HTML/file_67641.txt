<span class="headword">Harrison,  Beatrice Bohun</span>  (1892&#150;1965), <span class="occ">cellist</span>, was born on 9 December 1892 in Roorkee, in the North-Western Provinces of India, the second of the four daughters of Colonel John H. C. Harrison RE (<i>d</i>. 1936), at that time principal of the College of Sappers and Miners, and his wife, Annie (<i>d</i>. 1934), daughter of Charles Martin, a civil engineer. All four daughters were musical, as was their mother, who had been a pupil of George Henschel, and two others besides Beatrice became professional musicians: May (1890&#150;1959), a violinist, and Margaret (1899&#150;1995), a violinist and later a pianist. Shortly after Beatrice's birth, the family returned to England, where Colonel Harrison was given the command of the home battalion of the Royal Engineers at Chatham barracks, and also took charge of the band of the Royal Engineers. In 1902 he retired in order to devote his life to his family.<br>
<br>The girls were educated at home, starting music lessons at a very early age, but Beatrice did not begin to learn the cello until she was nine, when her mother gave her a full-size cello, taller than she. After being awarded the gold medal of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music at the age of ten, in 1904 she won an exhibition to the Royal College of Music, London, where she studied with William Whitehouse, and a scholarship in 1907; in the latter year she made her d&eacute;but at the Queen's Hall, playing the Saint-Sa&euml;ns cello concerto no. 1 in A minor under Henry Wood. After playing to King Edward VII at a private dinner party she became a close friend of Princess Victoria, a good pianist, and it was she who paid for her cello (Pietro Guarneri, 1739) after her American benefactress died. In 1908 the whole family moved to Berlin so that she could have lessons with Hugo Becker at the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik, where in 1910 she was the youngest student ever to win the Mendelssohn prize, and she made her European d&eacute;but in Berlin in 1910.<br>
<br>After returning to England in 1910 Beatrice Harrison embarked on a solo career, with many tours to Europe and North America. In the United States, in 1913, she was the first woman cellist to play at Carnegie Hall, and the first to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It was after a performance in Manchester in 1914, with her sister May, of the Brahms double concerto with the Hall&eacute; orchestra under Thomas Beecham, that she first met Frederick Delius, who became a close friend of the Harrison family. Delius greatly admired Beatrice's passionate playing and full tone, and she played an important part in introducing Delius's works to American audiences. Delius wrote his double concerto (1915) for Beatrice and May Harrison, encouraging Beatrice to make any alterations she wished to the solo cello part; he wrote these into the definitive score, and they gave the first performance in the presence of the composer at the Queen's Hall in 1920. She gave the first performance of his cello sonata (1916), dedicated to her, with Hamilton Harty at the Wigmore Hall, and the British premi&egrave;re of his cello concerto (1921), which Delius had begun to compose in the Harrisons' garden, in 1923. She performed the serenade from Delius's incidental music to <span class="italic">Hassan</span>, arranged by Eric Fenby in 1929 for solo cello and chamber orchestra, in Boston in 1930, and Delius wrote <span class="italic">Caprice and Elegy</span> (1930) for her for this American tour. It was Beatrice Harrison's recording of <span class="italic">Caprice and Elegy</span>, made for HMV, that was played by the BBC after Neville Chamberlain's broadcast on 3 September 1939 announcing that England was at war with Germany. After Delius's death in France in 1934 the Harrisons arranged for his body to be taken to England in 1935, and he was reburied in Limpsfield churchyard in Surrey, close to the Harrison family grave.<br>
<br>Beatrice Harrison became closely associated with the Elgar cello concerto (1919), recording first an abridged version for HMV in 1919, with a complete recording, conducted by Elgar, following in 1928, and it was thanks to her many performances that it became so popular. Elgar felt she conveyed the spirit of the work as he had intended it, and always used her as the soloist when he conducted the work. She performed works by other contemporary British composers, many of whom were inspired to write for her: Arnold Bax became a close friend, and she commissioned a cello sonata (1923) from him, which she first performed in 1924 with Harriet Cohen. He wrote <span class="italic">Rhapsodic Ballad</span> (1939) for her, and she gave many performances of his cello concerto (1934), including two at the Promenade Concerts during the Second World War. Roger Quilter's cello solo &#145;L'amour de moy&#146; and John Ireland's cello sonata (1923) were written for her, and her recording of an old Irish folk tune, &#145;The Lament of Fanaid Grove&#146; (1926), arranged by the Irish composer Herbert Hughes and dedicated to her, became very famous. She also gave the first performances in Britain of Kod&aacute;ly's sonata for unaccompanied cello (1915) and, with her sister Margaret, Ravel's sonata for cello and violin (1920&#150;22).<br>
<br>But to the wider public Beatrice Harrison was known for her famous nightingale broadcasts. She had discovered while playing her cello in the woods at night in the garden of the Harrisons' house, Foyle Riding, in Surrey, that she could make a nightingale sing with her, and in 1924 persuaded John Reith, general manager of the BBC, to arrange an outside broadcast. At midnight on 19 May 1924 over a million people listened while she played a duet with the nightingale, and for the next twelve years the BBC broadcast her nightingale concerts in May. Thousands of visitors flocked to Foyle Riding during the nightingale season; the Harrisons entertained musicians and friends, and chartered buses to bring families from the East End, giving them tea and beer until midnight. The broadcasts gave her a good deal of publicity, and the nightingale was depicted on her concert posters and embroidered on her concert dresses.<br>
<br>Her mother's death in 1934 was a great blow. Beatrice had always lived at home with her parents and sisters, and had never led an independent life. Her mother had organized all her concert tours and usually accompanied her on them. Her youngest sister Margaret took over their mother's role, often also accompanying Beatrice on the piano. Beatrice continued to perform regularly until the 1950s, and her last public performance was a televised recital in 1958 to raise money for the rebuilding of Coventry Cathedral.<br>
<br>Beatrice Harrison died on 10 March 1965 at Smallfield, near Horley, Surrey, and was buried on 16 March. She was unmarried. Strikingly beautiful with dark auburn hair, she had many suitors, but she devoted her life single-mindedly to the cello. The leading British cellist of her generation, she was also the first British cellist to win an international reputation. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">The Cello and the Nightingales</span>, was published in 1985. To mark the centenary of her birth, a radio play, <span class="italic">The Cello and the Nightingale</span>, by Patricia Cleveland-Peck, was broadcast in 1992.<br>
