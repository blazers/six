<span class="headword">Field <span class="st"> [Feilde]</span>,  John</span>  (1544/5?&#150;1588), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a Londoner of unknown parentage, supported at Oxford by the Clothworkers' Company. The details of his university career are hard to disentangle from those of contemporaries with the same names, but he was probably the John Field who proceeded BA in 1564 and MA in 1567. He was ordained by Bishop Grindal on 25 March 1566 at the uncanonical age of twenty-one, when he was described as a bachelor of arts of Christ Church. He could already rely on the patronage of Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick. On the day after his ordination, thirty-seven London ministers were suspended at Lambeth for their refusal to wear the prescribed vestments, the overture to the Elizabethan puritan movement, and Field was probably one of the &#145;godly young men&#146; without livings who were not required to conform and who stepped into the pulpits vacated by the nonconformists. But they too were soon silenced and Field returned to Oxford and to Broadgates Hall.<br>
<br>A letter written to the martyrologist John Foxe in January 1567 establishes that Field was serving his literary apprenticeship by researching materials for the second, 1570, edition of the <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, and that he was probably close to Foxe's friend and the proto-nonconformist Laurence Humphrey, president of Magdalen College. By the spring of 1568 he had returned to London, became one of a group of puritans who regularly preached in the near-separatist parish of Holy Trinity Minories (a peculiar parish in every sense), and was soon curate of the neighbouring parish of St Giles Cripplegate, where all his children were baptized. By 1570 he was married and in 1571 he moved into his own house in Grub Street, where he was Foxe's neighbour. Another near neighbour was the seriously rich haberdasher Nicholas Culverwell of St Martin Vintry who, with other Culverwells, seems to have acted as fund-raiser and banker to the emergent puritan cause, and as a sustainer of the wider Calvinist international. In 1569 Field witnessed Culverwell's will. Nicholas's brother Richard Culverwell carried on the good work, and Richard Bancroft would later note that the money collected by the puritans &#145;for their brethren that travel for them beyond the seas&#146; was &#145;commonly delivered&#146; to Field and Culverwell  (Peel, <span class="italic">Tracts</span>, xxix).<br>
<br>According to a hostile witness, a renegade who twenty years later gave evidence against his old associates in Star Chamber, it was about 1570 that Field began to be an organizer, together with a curate of All Hallows, Honey Lane, Thomas Wilcox, convening meetings of some of the younger London ministers which were in embryonic form the conferences, or classes, of Calvinist ecclesiology. In 1572 Field would endorse something called &#145;the order of Wandsworth&#146;, evidently a kind of experimental presbytery, leading to the mistake, repeated by one church historian after another, that he was minister of that place. (Bancroft did not know how they &#145;grew to be so farre gone at Wandesworth&#146;  (Bancroft, <span class="italic">Daungerous Positions</span>, 43) and nor do we.) In the same year Field and Wilcox, speaking for this new and militant tendency, published their <span class="italic">Admonition to the Parliament</span>, a brilliant piece of journalism which brought a novel intensity to the faltering campaign for further reformation which was making heavy weather in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Admonition</span> was a declaration of ecclesiastical war, and it lifted out of academe and into a more public domain the radical presbyterianism which Thomas Cartwright had been teaching in Cambridge. Field claimed sole responsibility for the &#145;bitterness of the style&#146;  (Peel, <span class="italic">Register</span>, 1.89), and would later fall out with the milder Wilcox in an acrimonious correspondence which was one of Bancroft's more interesting discoveries. His bitterness, and perhaps the intransigently anti-episcopal position which it coated, were at least partly circumstantial, the result of being suspended from his preaching ministry and reduced to school teaching. In trying to engage the support for the burgeoning presbyterian movement of one of the older &#145;fathers&#146; of the reformed cause, Anthony Gilby of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Field wrote of &#145;the over-much tyranny of those that should be my encouragers&#146;  (CUL, MS Mm.1.43, p. 447). Field and Wilcox were imprisoned in Newgate, where their many visitors, not all sympathetic, seem to have engaged in debates about the direction which the cause should now take. When John Whitgift published his <span class="italic">Answer</span> to the <span class="italic">Admonition</span> and Cartwright his <span class="italic">Reply</span>, which began the &#145;Admonition controversy&#146;, it was clear that this would be no nine days' wonder. After the influence of powerful friends&#151;the earls of Leicester and Warwick&#151;secured his release, nothing is heard of Field for two years, and it is very possible that he himself became one of the brethren who travelled &#145;beyond the seas&#146;, perhaps joining Cartwright and other puritans in the Calvinist sanctuary of Heidelberg. By now Field knew the power of print, and it looks significant that in 1574 some major manifestos of English presbyterianism appeared from a Heidelberg press.<br>
<br>Field is next heard of in London in 1577 and, with the advent of Archbishop Grindal, things had changed, a truce in what a contemporary called &#145;civil wars of the Church of God&#146;  (Peel, <span class="italic">Register</span>, 1.191). Although, according to Bishop Aylmer, he was teaching &#145;God knows what&#146; in private houses  (Strype, 36&#150;7), Field was now devoting much of his energy to the common anti-Catholic cause, his vehicle prefaces to translations of French works of protestant apology addressed to the great protestant earls. It was one of these publications, dedicated to Leicester, which provoked Robert Persons's <span class="italic">Brief Discourse why Catholics Refuse to Go to Church</span>, to which Field responded in his <span class="italic">Caveat for Parsons</span>, again dedicated to Leicester. Field was working his way back to a kind of respectability. In 1579 Leicester secured him a preaching licence from Oxford University and in 1581 he became lecturer at St Mary Aldermary, where he was at liberty to preach until once more suspended in 1585. But he was still the same Field, and in 1581 he took Leicester to task for his patronage of stage plays, in the same year taking advantage of a fatal accident in the Paris Garden bearpit to castigate in print the new leisure industry and its profanation of the sabbath.<br>
<br>When John Whitgift succeeded Grindal in 1583, civil war was resumed, and Field seems to have been glad, looking back on &#145;this unhappy time of looseness and liberty gaining upon me and choking those good things which I thank God I was wont to feel in greater measure&#146;  (Usher, 95&#150;6). When Whitgift imposed subscription to his three articles as a new test of conformity, which some hundreds of ministers throughout the province initially refused, Field was active in pressing an intransigent line, condemning the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in its entirety and denouncing the limited and qualified subscriptions for which most of the non-subscribers would eventually settle. He wrote that one might as well subscribe to Aesop's fables. The new crisis stimulated the establishment of classis-type conferences in the country, and especially in Essex and Northamptonshire, a development which had begun a little before the arrival of Whitgift. For example, the only fully recorded conference, meeting in and around Dedham, held its first meeting in October 1582. It was now that all those letters were written to Field from which Bancroft loved to quote: &#145;I hope all things were so proceeded in as your self would like of&#146;, this from Suffolk  (Bancroft, <span class="italic">Daungerous Positions</span>, 44); &#145;we have taken order for our monthly assembly&#146;, this from Oxford  (ibid., 76). Much of the business that was transacted in the conferences was local and circumstantial, but it included concerted petitioning whenever parliament met, and the formal discussion of drafts of a <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, a constitution for a presbyterian Church of England.<br>
<br>John Field had thus become the linchpin of a precociously organized presbyterian movement which threatened the Church of England with a revolution which would have deprived it of both bishops and prayer book. He had also made himself the clearing house for the amassing of what Foxe would have called &#145;monuments&#146; of the puritan cause and its repression, matter for a new book of martyrs. Some of these materials were published overseas in 1593 as <span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span>. The remainder, the so-called &#145;Seconde parte of a register&#146;, is preserved in a collection of manuscripts in Dr Williams's Library. Throughout the 1580s the literary warfare between the presbyterian puritans and the bishops and other proponents of conformity intensified, and on the puritan side it was masterminded by Field with the assistance of the dedicated printer Robert Waldegrave. Field was becoming progressively more radical, and according to that same hostile witness was given to saying that since the cause could not be won &#145;by suit nor dispute&#146;, it was up to &#145;the multitude and people&#146; to bring the discipline to pass  (TNA: PRO, STAC 5/A49/34). It is perhaps significant that when Richard Culverwell made his will in 1584, he left Field &pound;3 but failed to appoint him one of the trustees to disburse the princely sum of &pound;350 he left to sustain the godly cause. In the autumn of 1588, in some desperation, Waldegrave (whose original press had been sawn in half) and the author or authors of the pamphlets published in the name of a certain Martin Marprelate resorted to a secret weapon, which has been compared to poison gas, particularly because it blew back into the faces of those using it. The outrageous and seditious Marprelate tracts drew freely on Field's register, and it was in the course of searching for Marprelate and his press that Field's correspondence, together with much else besides, was discovered, leading to an exemplary prosecution in Star Chamber of some of the leading presbyterians&#151;but not of Field, who had died in March 1588 at St Giles Cripplegate, before the final act of this tragedy. He was buried on 26 March at St Giles, and was survived by his wife, Joan. Two of his seven children rose to the top in professions which would have horrified their father. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9395/', "Theophilus Field (bap. 1575)")</script> was to be bishop of St David's, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9391/', "Nathan Field")</script>, born not long before his father's death, was to become a notable dramatist, the apprentice of Ben Jonson who performed in Jonson's anti-puritan plays.<br>
<br>John Field is somewhat inadequately defined as a puritan minister and preacher. Bancroft, who followed Field's trail with all the dedicated persistence with which Dostoyevsky's policeman pursued Raskolnikov, and who had possession of his books and papers, captures his true historical significance:<blockquote>This John <i>Field</i> &hellip; whilest he lived was a great and a chiefe man amongst the brethren of <i>London</i>: and one to whome the managing of the discipline (for the outward practise of it) was especially (by the rest) committed. So as all their letters, that were directed from the brethren of other places to have this or that referred to the London assemblies were for the most part directed vnto him. (Bancroft, <span class="italic">Survay</span>, 369)</blockquote>
