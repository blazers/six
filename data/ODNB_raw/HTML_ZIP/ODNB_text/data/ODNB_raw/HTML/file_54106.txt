<span class="headword">Allen,  George Cyril</span>  (1900&#150;1982), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 28 June 1900, at 5 Bertie Terrace, Park Road, Kenilworth, Warwickshire, the only child of George Henry Allen (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1875&#150;1940), a coachman and domestic servant who later became dispatch foreman at the Humber motor works, Coventry, and his wife, Elizabeth Sharman, daughter of a baker in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. He was educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry (<i>c</i>.1911&#150;18), and the University of Birmingham (1918&#150;21), where he was a student in the faculty of commerce. There the economic historian Sir William Ashley, with his blend of economics and history, had an important influence on him. Allen wrote an MComm thesis, &#145;Restrictive practices in the copper mining industry&#146;, which was the first sign of his lifelong interest in the economics of industry. Ashley thought sufficiently well of it to send a copy to Keynes, then editor of the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>. Keynes asked Allen to write a paper on the subject, and this appeared in the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span> in 1923.<br>
<br>Ashley was also instrumental in giving Allen the opportunity of a teaching post in Japan. In 1922 he urged Allen to accept a two-year appointment as a lecturer in economics at the new Nagoya high school (later part of the University of Nagoya) in central Japan. Thus began Allen's lifelong study of Japanese economic affairs, and of Japan as a nation. Henceforward his academic work and his publications were shared between the study of the economics of British industry and the study of Japan. On his return to Britain, he took up a research fellowship and then a lectureship at his old university, Birmingham. In 1925 his article on Japan's currency and exchange rate policy was published in the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>. His first book, <span class="italic">Modern Japan and its Problems</span>, was published in 1928, and the next year he published <span class="italic">The Industrial Development of Birmingham and the Black Country, 1860&#150;1927</span>. Both books were innovatory in their fields, and that on Japan was especially original, linking as it did a study of Japan's political and social organization with its financial and industrial systems.<br>
<br>On the basis of these achievements Allen was appointed in 1929 the first holder of the chair of economics and commerce at Hull University College, at the age of twenty-eight. In the same year he married Eleanora (Nell) Shanks (<i>d</i>. 1972), daughter of David Shanks JP of Moseley, Birmingham; they had no children. From 1933 to 1947 Allen was Brunner professor of economic science at the University of Liverpool, and from 1947 to 1967 professor of political economy at University College, London. In 1975 he retired to Oxford, and in 1980 was made a supernumerary fellow of St Antony's College, where he welcomed the foundation of the new Nissan Institute for Japanese Studies.<br>
<br>Allen also had experience outside the university. In 1930 he served briefly as economic adviser to Lloyd George. During the war years he served in the Board of Trade, where he was mainly concerned with work on post-war reconstruction. He was an active member of the group of economists anxious to introduce legislation to control monopoly and restrictive practices. This led to the prominence given to the subject in the 1944 white paper on employment policy, and eventually to the legislation of 1948. From 1950 to 1962 he was a member of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission (from 1956 the Monopolies Commission). He also served on the Central Price Regulation Committee (1944&#150;53) and on several other official committees.<br>
<br>In 1945 Allen's Japanese expertise was called upon by the Foreign Office, where for six months he was in charge of the Japanese section of the economic and industrial planning staff. There his unique knowledge of the Japanese economy contributed to the formulation by the allied powers of policy towards Japan during the occupation. His optimism about Japan's economic prospects was almost unique in Britain at that time.<br>
<br>In his last year at Hull, Allen published what was perhaps his best-known work, <span class="italic">British Industries and their Organization</span> (1933), which was to go through five editions, the last in 1970. It combined a historical account of the industries covered with an analysis of their current economic problems. For many years this was by far the most valuable book on British industry. Allen continued to be a prolific author in his two chosen fields, but from 1938 the books he wrote were mainly about Japan and the Far East, though his articles, pamphlets, and other publications show a rough balance between his interests in Britain and Japan. His work was pragmatic rather than ideological, relying on detailed knowledge of the subject and emphasizing the importance of institutional and social factors.<br>
<br>Allen made many visits to Japan, where he was much respected. He received the order of the Rising Sun in 1961 and the Japan Foundation award in 1980. His genial personality and acute analytical mind made him very well liked and regarded wherever he worked. He was appointed CBE in 1958 and elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1965. He died at his home, 15 Ritchie Court, 380 Banbury Road, Oxford, on 31 July 1982.<br>
