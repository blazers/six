<span class="headword">Raper,  Henry</span>  (1799&#150;1859), <span class="occ">naval officer and writer on navigation</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23143/', "Admiral Henry Raper (1767&#150;1845)")</script> and his wife, formerly a Miss Craig. After attending Charterhouse School he entered the navy in November 1811 on board the <i>Mars</i>, his father's ship. He joined the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth in March 1812, passing out with distinction in 1814, and being awarded the silver medal for proficiency in mathematics. After a short time in the frigate <i>Nymphen</i> as a midshipman, he was appointed in October 1815 to the <i>Alceste</i> with Captain Murray Maxwell, conveying William Pitt Amherst, Earl Amherst, as envoy to the emperor of China. The mission was not a success; and on the homeward passage, on 18 February 1817, the <i>Alceste</i> struck a rock in the Strait of Gaspar, off the south-east coast of Sumatra. Raper bore his full share of the hardships experienced by the crew from weather, thirst and pirates. Between 1817 and 1820 he was a midshipman in the <i>Tyne</i> (26 guns) on the South American station, and the frigate <i>Seringapatam</i> at home and in the Mediterranean. In January 1821 he was appointed to the sloop <i>Adventure</i>, with Commander William Henry Smyth, surveying in the Mediterranean, though he did not join her until the spring of 1822; he was placed in charge of the chronometers, and had exceptional opportunities for the scientific study of navigation, nautical astronomy, and surveying. On 17 May 1823 he was promoted to lieutenant, and was appointed to the <i>Euryalus</i>, and then to the brig <i>Dispatch</i>. In January 1825, when Captain Frederick William Beechey commissioned the <i>Blossom</i> for hydrographic surveys in the northern Pacific, he offered Raper the post of first lieutenant at the suggestion of Smyth, all three having served together in the <i>Adventure</i>. Raper, however, imagined that his father had been undeservedly slighted by the Admiralty, and declined Beechey's offer, thus virtually retiring from active service.<br>
<br>From that time Raper devoted himself to nautical science, greatly encouraged by Smyth. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical and Royal Astronomical societies, repeatedly served on their councils, and was secretary of the latter society from 1839 to 1842. In 1832 he was appointed by the Admiralty to a committee that was to consider the method of measuring the tonnage of ships, and the report was drawn up principally by him. In 1840 he published his <span class="italic">Practice of Navigation and Nautical Astronomy</span>, for which he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society; the East India Company supplied copies to their ships, and&#151;an unusual distinction&#151;the Admiralty in January 1843 ordered a copy to be supplied to each of her majesty's ships. It remained a standard work for many years, the twenty-first edition being published in 1920. Other published works were <span class="italic">Rules for Finding Distances and Heights at Sea</span> (1831), and <span class="italic">Sailing Directions for the Western Coast of Africa</span> (1849).<br>
<br>Raper married in November 1850 the daughter of the Revd Frederick Ekins of Morpeth. He suffered severely from rheumatism and neuralgia during the last eighteen months of his life, but continued his labours up to the last, submitting a paper, &#145;An improvement in clearing the lunar distance&#146;, to the Royal Astronomical Society shortly before he died at Torquay, Devon, on 6 January 1859. His wife survived him.<br>
