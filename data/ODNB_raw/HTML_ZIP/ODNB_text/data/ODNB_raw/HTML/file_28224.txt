<span class="headword">Vergil,  Polydore</span> <span class="st"> [Polidoro Virgili]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1470&#150;1555), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was probably born at Fermignano, near Urbino, where his father, Giorgio di Antonio, owned a dispensary. He was the youngest of four sons. He is generally accepted as having been born about 1470 on the grounds that he was ordained priest some time before 20 December 1496, and the canonical age for ordination was twenty-five.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlywritings"></a>Family background and early writings</h2>There was a tradition of scholarship in the Virgili family. A grandfather, Antonio Virgilio, described as &#145;most learned in medicine and astrology&#146;  (Hay, 1), taught in the University of Paris. An older brother, Giovanni-Matteo, was a student of the philosopher Pietro Pomponazzi and himself taught philosophy at Ferrara and Padua. An uncle, Teseo Pinni, a clergyman and lawyer, wrote a book on vagabonds, <span class="italic">Speculum cerretanorum</span>, which was mentioned by Erasmus in his <span class="italic">Ecclesiastes</span> and published at Wittenberg in 1528 in an edition with a preface by Martin Luther. The family was armigerous: its arms, a laurel and two lizards, are discussed in Polydore's <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span>, and a banner bearing them was recorded between 1540 and 1542 as hanging above the appropriate choir stall in Wells Cathedral, where he was archdeacon.<br>
<br>Vergil studied at the University of Padua, and possibly, although this is less secure, at Bologna under Filippo Beroaldo the elder, the author of an <span class="italic">Oratio proverbiorum</span>. In 1496 he published in Venice an enlarged edition of Niccol&ograve; Perotti's <span class="italic">Cornucopiae</span>, a work that in turn influenced his own first books, the <span class="italic">Proverbiorum libellus</span> (Venice, 1498) and <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span> (Venice, 1499). The former, a collection of proverbs, was retitled <span class="italic">Adagiorum liber</span> in later editions after a minor controversy over the primacy of each man's work arose between Vergil and Erasmus, whose own <span class="italic">Adagia</span> were published two years later in 1500. Erasmus claimed to have published his <span class="italic">Adagia</span> several years before hearing Vergil's name, and as late as 1533 he still claimed (incorrectly) that his collection had been published before the latter's. The two men probably first met after Erasmus's second trip to England in 1505. They had many friends in common, exchanged many letters, and Erasmus later wrote that they had once laughed at table over their former rivalry. It is indeed significant that the two men were never seriously estranged by the dispute over their collections of adages. Vergil's collection, which was also the subject of a charge of literary theft by a more obscure humanist, Ludovico Gorgeri, went through frequent printings down to the seventeenth century, but its popularity, though considerable, was nevertheless far exceeded by that of his second book, the <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span>.<br>
<br>In its first edition of 1499 <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span> consisted of three books. Each chapter was devoted to a question of origins&#151;the origin of the gods, the beginning of things, the creation of men, the origin of languages, down to the origins of prostitution, the printing press, and the first warm baths. Then in 1521 Vergil published an expanded version in eight books, in which the five new books treated principally religious questions. These additional books were already substantially complete by 1517, the date of their dedicatory letter. In his discussions of beginnings Vergil typically went through all the Latin and Greek authorities known to him, before proceeding to the earlier treatments of the relevant questions in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. At Urbino he had at his disposal one of Europe's most impressive collections of Greek and Latin texts, enabling him to make <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span> one of the new humanist encyclopaedias, a book which, like Raffaello Maffei's slightly later <span class="italic">Commentarii urbani</span> (Rome, 1508), attempted to bring together the new learning made available by the efforts of Renaissance humanists.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span> Vergil's most frequently cited source is the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, followed by Josephus and Eusebius, but in his search for beginnings he ranged over a vast number of writers. In many instances he also drew on his own experiences and those of his contemporaries, as when he described marital and baptismal customs, or the bonfires of Umbria, or (in the later books) the way the English kissed in greeting one another and the brevity of English widowhood. In its Latin format the work went through more than thirty editions in Vergil's lifetime, and altogether there were more than 100 editions when the numerous vernacular translations are included. His discussion in the last five books of the practice of Christian religion in his own day follows a generally Erasmian line. He is critical of monks, attacks priestly celibacy, and criticizes the sale of indulgences at length. Martin Luther is mentioned twice, but not criticized. Consequently the book came in for searching scrutiny by the Catholic authorities, and in 1551, while its author was still alive, it was condemned by the Sorbonne. In 1564, when it was placed on the Trent index of prohibited books, it was said that the book had been &#145;expanded by the heretics&#146;  (Hay, 56 n.1); and an expurgated, approved version was published in Rome in 1576. An English &#145;translation&#146; by Thomas Langley was published in 1546; however, this version omitted a full nine-tenths of the original text. An authoritative critical edition and translation was published by Brian Copenhaver in 2002; the translation by Beno Weiss and Louis Perez (1997) usefully distinguishes the passages suppressed by religious censors.<h2>
<a name="Servantofthepapacy"></a>Servant of the papacy</h2>Although Vergil wrote his first two books at Urbino, little is known about his education or employment there. The <span class="italic">Proverbiorum libellus</span> was dedicated to Duke Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span> to Lodovico Odasio, who had been the duke's tutor. On the evidence of these dedications and of his considerable use of the ducal library, it has been suggested that Vergil was in the service of Duke Guidobaldo. Indeed it seems possible that the duke personally commissioned the <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span>. The letters of a Venetian functionary in Ravenna, published in Sanudo's <span class="italic">Diarii</span>, mention a Polydore who was serving as secretary to Guidobaldo, a possible indicator of Vergil's position at Urbino; but since Sanudo dated these letters in 1503, when Vergil was already in England, his employment as ducal secretary cannot be regarded as certain.<br>
<br>The circumstances in which Vergil left Urbino to enter the service of Pope Alexander VI are not known. He is first recorded as a papal employee in 1502, when he was selected by one of Alexander VI's intimates, Adriano Castellesi da Corneto, to represent his interests in England. Castellesi had been collector of Peter's pence since 1490, and Vergil was sent to England as his subcollector. A Venetian ambassador, writing in 1502, described Castellesi as a &#145;hard and sinister man &hellip; much favored by the pontiff&#146;  (Paschini, 59), while another contemporary, Raffaello Maffei, called him Alexander's &#145;vicar in all things&#146;  (ibid., 61). An accomplice in Cesare Borgia's infamous slaughter of his enemies at Senigallia in January 1503, Castellesi was made cardinal priest of San Grisogono the following May. Thus Vergil was working as an agent of the Borgias during their seizure of his native Urbino from the Montefeltro in 1502&#150;3.<br>
<br>When Vergil arrived as Castellesi's agent in England in 1502, he was received by Henry VII and &#145;ever after was entertained by him kindly&#146;, as he later wrote in the <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>  (Hay, 4). Already the author of two books, it seems likely that he was treated as a celebrity in an England that was eager for things Italian. Certainly he became well known to learned Englishmen&#151;Erasmus listed Thomas More, Cuthbert Tunstall, Thomas Linacre, and William Latimer as among Vergil's English friends. Like More, Vergil belonged to Doctors' Commons, and he appears to have been on good terms with Colet's St Paul's School. One measure of Vergil's success in England is his accumulation of church benefices. In 1503 Sir Nicholas Griffin presented him to the living of Church Langton, Leicestershire; in 1507 he acquired prebends in Lincoln and Hereford cathedrals; in 1508 he became archdeacon of Wells and prebendary of Brent; in 1513 he was collated to the prebend of Oxgate in St Paul's. In 1504 he was charged with violating currency laws, but the case was regularly deferred until 1509, when he received a royal pardon.<br>
<br>Through his employer Castellesi, Vergil may have played a role in furthering ties between England and the restored Montefeltro court at Urbino. English relations with Urbino dated from the bestowal of the Order of the Garter on Duke Federigo da Montefeltro by Edward IV in 1474. With the death of Alexander VI on 18 August 1503 (after dinner at Castellesi's villa), followed shortly afterwards by that of Pius III on 18 October, and then by the election of Giuliano della Rovere, a deadly enemy of the Borgias, as Pope Julius II, Cardinal Castellesi found himself in a politically exposed position, so much so that Duke Guidobaldo of Urbino was able to put pressure on the cardinal to propose him to Henry VII for membership of the Order of the Garter. The ostensible purpose of his designation was to secure the support of the Montefeltro, who were related to the della Rovere, for Henry's quest for a papal dispensation that would permit Prince Henry to marry Katherine of Aragon. Henry VII concurred with the proposal, and Guidobaldo received the Garter in 1504 in Rome. Two years later, Count Baldassare Castiglione travelled to England to stand as proxy for Guidobaldo at the latter's formal installation. Castiglione almost certainly met Vergil, indeed, he probably lodged with him in London; Elias Ashmole, writing in the late seventeenth century, recorded that Castiglione stayed with one &#145;Paulus de Gygeles, the Pope's Vice-Collector&#146;  (Cartwright, 1.180), most likely a garbling or misreading of Polidorus de Virgiliis, who was indeed the &#145;Vice-Collector&#146;. Vergil's personal copy of the later printed edition of the oration Castiglione composed for this occasion survives in the Vatican Library.<h2>
<a name="VergilandEnglishhistory"></a>Vergil and English history</h2>Vergil is best known today for his <span class="italic">English History</span>, the <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>. He had probably kept a journal and begun his research into English history soon after his arrival in 1502, but research for a full-scale history of England most likely began in 1506&#150;7, encouraged by Henry VII. A first manuscript version of the <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, covering events to 1513, was completed in 1512&#150;13 and is now preserved in the Vatican Library. This work was first published at Basel in 1534 by Johann Bebel, but in a version that only went down to 1509. This was followed by a much revised second edition of 1546, and by a third edition of 1555 that was again revised by the author and extended to 1538. True to the methods of the humanist historiography first developed by Leonardo Bruni in his early fifteenth-century <span class="italic">History of the Florentine People</span>, Vergil adopted a critical approach which required a comparison of the available sources before he constructed a single narrative of his own, one intended to be more accurate. In a further imitation of Bruni and the historians of antiquity, he composed speeches of his own that he put into the mouths of historical personages, with the inevitable result that his accounts of events often read quite differently from those found in contemporary chronicles, giving rise to the famous and unfounded allegations by his critics that he had burnt older sources in order to hide his errors.<br>
<br>But although he frequently complained of a lack of documentation, Vergil was in fact able to compile an impressive array of sources. For his treatment of early Britain he used a wide array of classical authorities (for example Caesar, Tacitus, Pliny, and Strabo), many of which he probably consulted in the ducal library during a return visit to Urbino in 1514. For the post-Roman and later periods he relied especially on Gildas (whose <span class="italic">De excidio et conquestu Brittaniae</span> he discovered and published in 1525), Bede (whom he greatly admired), William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, William of Newburgh, Roger of Howden, and Matthew Paris. For the later middle ages he used Ranulf Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> and at least one version of the <span class="italic">Brut</span>, and he also drew extensively on Flavio Biondo, Bartolomeo Platina, Jean Froissart, Enguerrand de Monstrelet, and Robert Gaguin. He also used many documentary sources, including legal and heraldic material, along with the records of the office of collector of Peter's pence. A surviving letter to James IV of Scotland asks for the names and deeds of the Scottish kings. James refused to help, possibly because he thought Scottish history should be written by a Scot, but Gavin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, provided the requested information about 1522. An acute observer of his surroundings, Vergil also obtained a good deal of contemporary information from courtiers close to Henry VII.<br>
<br>Vergil frequently showed a sophisticated critical intelligence in his researches, for instance in his investigation of the languages spoken in Britain. His destructive analysis of Geoffrey of Monmouth, and in particular his denial of the historicity of King Arthur, resulted in his being attacked by the antiquarian John Leland, who attempted to prove Arthur's existence in the <span class="italic">Assertio inclytissimi Arturii regis Britanniae</span> (London, 1544). His ecclesiastical livings and prebends, his many friends in the English church, his work for the Peter's pence, and especially his Italian origins, also laid him open to attack from the more radical of the English reformers during the religious convulsions of the mid-sixteenth century. Although the protestant historian John Bale did not &#145;disprayse of his lernynge, (which I knowe to be verye excellent)&#146;, he still accused Vergil in 1544 of &#145;polutynge oure Englyshe chronycles most shamefullye with his Romishe lyes and other Italyshe beggerye&#146;  (Trimble, 38). Nearly a century later, in a Commons debate of 1628, when Vergil's history was cited as evidence that Cambridge was older than Oxford, the Oxonian Edward Littleton is said to have demanded, &#145;What have we to do with Polydore Vergil? One Vergil was a poet, the other a liar&#146;  (Woolf, 24). Yet notwithstanding these attacks, Vergil's treatment of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, at least, remained authoritative down to the nineteenth century. From the wicked Richard III (largely echoed by Sir Thomas More, but all the more plausible in his villainy in Vergil's ostensibly impartial pages) down to the ambitious and arrogant Wolsey, &#145;Vergil's story has become part of the national myth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, xxxix). Surprisingly, the <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span> still awaits a complete critical edition and modern translation, although the period down to 1485 is accessible in translations published by Henry Ellis (1844, 1846), while Denys Hay's fine edition covers the years 1485&#150;1537.<h2>
<a name="LastyearsinEnglandandItaly"></a>Last years in England and Italy</h2>In 1508, while Vergil was just beginning work on the <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, Julius II deprived him of his subcollectorship of Peter's pence, conferring it instead on Pietro Griffo. Although Vergil's income from his benefices comfortably exceeded what he received as subcollector, he still made every effort to hold onto that office, and when Griffo arrived in England, Vergil refused to relinquish either the collectorship or its records and seals. Only after the pope sent a strong letter did Griffo obtain possession in 1509, but when he left England in 1512, Vergil took the office back, keeping it until 1515. In February 1514 Henry VIII wrote to Leo X to commend Vergil, who, he said, wished to visit his native land after twelve years' absence. Vergil duly travelled to Italy that year, visiting Rome first, where among other matters he discussed the issue of a cardinal's hat for Thomas Wolsey with his long-time patron, Cardinal Castellesi. He then proceeded to Urbino, where he paid a brother 600 florins to endow a chapel in the cathedral.<br>
<br>In 1515 Vergil returned to London, only to find out that Henry VIII had begun to support Andreas Ammonius in a campaign to replace Castellesi as collector of Peter's pence. Ammonius, who had come to England about 1505, and had been Henry's Latin secretary since 1511, arranged to have Vergil's correspondence with Castellesi intercepted. Some letters critical of Wolsey were found, and their author was thrown into the Tower of London, where he remained from April until the end of 1515. For a while, his imprisonment became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. Leo X, Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, and the University of Oxford all petitioned the king to release him. But only after Wolsey had been made a cardinal in September, and then lord chancellor in December, was he released, probably at the new cardinal's instance. But his imprisonment made Vergil a confirmed enemy of Wolsey, and undoubtedly gave extra animus to the attack on the latter that Vergil published in the third edition of his <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>. Vergil also lost his subcollectorship, but he retained his ecclesiastical benefices. In 1516 Leo X and Castellesi summoned him to Rome, and afterwards he also visited Urbino again, before returning to England and his benefices before the end of 1517. After this crisis, and for the rest of his life, he managed to steer clear of political controversy.<br>
<br>In 1524 Vergil wrote a commentary on the Lord's prayer, with a prefatory letter to John Fisher, which was published in a combined edition of the <span class="italic">Proverbiorum libellus</span> and the <span class="italic">De inventoribus rerum</span> of 1525. In the latter year he edited Gildas, collating a manuscript lent him by Cuthbert Tunstall with one of his own. A <span class="italic">Dialogus de prodigiis</span> followed in 1526&#150;7, with a dedication (of 1530) to Francesco Maria della Rovere. Erasmus attempted to have this work published by Froben of Basel, but it did not appear until 1531, printed by Bebel. Erasmus dedicated an edition of some of John Chrysostom's sermons to Vergil, who himself completed a translation of Chrysostom's <span class="italic">Comparatio regis et monachi</span> in 1528; he published it in 1530. In June 1532 Vergil told Erasmus that he had been called back to Italy and that he was discussing the printing of the <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span> with Bebel. On 6 June 1533 he received licence to travel overseas with six horses and six servants, although he was still in London in August of that year, when he wrote the dedication to the first printed edition of the <span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>. He then travelled to the continent, stopping in Urbino to write his will, dated 1534, before returning to England that year. His last book, a collection of Latin <span class="italic">Dialogi</span>, was published by Isengrin in Basel in 1545, and in an Italian translation by Francesco Baldelli at Venice in 1550.<br>
<br>Vergil stayed out of England's religious conflicts. Though his religious sympathies seem likely to have been conservative, he signed the articles of 1536 which effectively repudiated the pope's efforts to summon a general council, and in 1547 he subscribed the declaration for communion in both kinds. His ecclesiastical duties did not interfere with his literary activities or participation in London social life. He lived in a house in St Paul's Churchyard that was described in 1522 as consisting of a hall, a parlour, three chambers, and four beds. From 1546 he appears to have been preparing to return home to Italy, since he resigned the archdeaconry of Wells at the end of that year. In 1550 he was licensed to return to Urbino without forfeiting the revenues from his offices, but he probably did not leave England until 1553. He died at Urbino on 18 April 1555, and was buried in the chapel he had endowed in the cathedral. His house in Urbino, which he had bequeathed to his brothers Giovanni-Francesco and Girolamo, belongs today to the University of Urbino.<br>
