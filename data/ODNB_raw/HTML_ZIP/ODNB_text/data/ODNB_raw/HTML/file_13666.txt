<span class="headword">Honywood <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Waters]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1527&#150;1620), <span class="occ">matriarch and sustainer of protestant martyrs</span>, was the daughter and coheir of Robert Waters, esquire, of Lenham, Kent, where she was born. In 1543 Mary married Robert Honywood, esquire, of Charing, Kent. The couple had 16 children and by the time of her death she had 114 grandchildren, 228 great-grandchildren, and 9 great-great-grandchildren. As Fuller remarks, &#145;thus she had a child for every day in the (though leap) year, and one over&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.86). Her many grandchildren included Michael Honywood (1596&#150;1681), the post-Restoration dean of Lincoln, and his brother Sir Thomas Honywood of Marks Hall (1587&#150;1666), a leading parliamentarian in Essex, where his father had acquired property. However, the same writer regarded Mary as &#145;more memorable on another account, viz., for the patient weathering out the tempest of a troubled conscience&#146;  (ibid., 2.85&#150;6). According to Simeon Foxe, the son of the martyrologist, Mrs Honywood languished &#145;sick of a consumption through melancholy&#146; from the age of forty, and during this time &#145;consulted with the gravest Divines and the best Physitians&#146; including his own father, John Foxe. Previously she had also sought spiritual solace from the martyr John Bradford and the renowned puritan preacher Edward Dering, both of whom corresponded with her. In 1592 it was reported that she had believed that she was possessed by a devil for some fourteen years and that in 1591 she had endured exorcism at the hands of the religious charlatan William Hacket. Simeon Foxe later recorded a meeting between Mrs Honywood and John Foxe, at which the latter assured her that she would recover and live to a great age. To which she replied &#145;as well might you have said &hellip; that if I should throw this glasse against the wall, I might beleeve it would not break to pieces&#146; and &#145;threw it forth&#146;. The glass hit a chest before falling to the ground without either breaking or cracking  (Foxe, sig. B3<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Other contemporary and later authors, including Fuller, cast this story as a miraculous test by Mrs Honywood of her salvation, for which Foxe gently reproved her. According to Fuller her encounter with Foxe did not cure Mrs Honywood, but some time later she suddenly received comfort &#145;like lightening into her soul&#146; and spent the rest of her life in &#145;spiritual gladnesse&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.86). Although most authors have concentrated on stories of Mary Honywood's numerous descendants and of her religious despair, she also played an important role as one of the female &#145;sustainers&#146; of the Marian martyrs. She corresponded with John Bradford, although they had never met, and Fuller records that &#145;in the days of Queen Mary she used to visit the prisons, and to comfort and relieve the confessors therein&#146;  (ibid.). He also states that Mrs Honywood was determined to see the end of John Bradford's sufferings and was present at his burning in 1555, when the press of people was so great that her shoes were trodden off and she was forced to walk barefoot from Smithfield to St Martin's before she could purchase a new pair.<br>
<br>Mary Honywood died at Marks Hall (bought in 1605 by her son Robert) on 12 May 1620, in her ninety-third year, and was buried at Lenham on the 20th. A portrait of her which descended in the Mildmay family, showing her holding the Venetian glass that failed to break, was reported in the early nineteenth century, but its present whereabouts is unknown. But pictures of her made in 1597 and 1605 survive in the Colchester and Essex Museum and Wren Library respectively.<br>
