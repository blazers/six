<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aung San</span>  (1915&#150;1947), <span class="occ">politician in Burma</span>, was born on 13 February 1915 at Natmauk, a small town in the Magwe district of central Burma, the youngest of nine children of U Pha, lawyer, and his wife, Daw Su. A sickly child but a gifted student, he was educated as a novice in a Buddhist monastic school and then at a high school to which he won a government scholarship. He was already interested in politics and adept at public speaking when he went to Rangoon University in 1932.<br>
<br>Beginning with the capture of Lower Burma in 1824&#150;6, Britain had completed the conquest of Burma in 1885&#150;6 when Thibaw, the last Burmese king, was deposed and exiled. Aung San's family was active in the resistance which followed in Upper Burma. By the 1930s students were to the forefront of Burmese nationalism. At university Aung San edited the student magazine and led a students' strike in 1936. In 1938 he joined other student activists in a fringe political group, <i>Dohbama Asi-ayone</i> (the &#145;We Burmans Association&#146;), of which he was general secretary until 1940. Leaders of the group adopted the prefix <i>Thakin</i> (Master). They organized political strikes in Burma's labour movement. Aung San was arrested in January 1939 on a charge of conspiring to overthrow the government but was released soon after.<br>
<br>Japan's rise to power was welcomed by Aung San as a means to defeat the British empire in Asia. In turn, Japanese military intelligence regarded Aung San and other activists as potential collaborators. In August 1940 Aung San and a companion were smuggled in disguise by ship to Amoy in China. By November 1940 he was in Japan. Agreement was reached that Japan would raise and train a Burma Independence Army (BIA) to assist in the invasion of Burma. A number of <i>thakins</i> formed a group known as the Thirty Comrades to spearhead an anti-British uprising. A blood oath was taken, and group members assumed titles signifying their bond. Aung San, now with the rank of major-general, was the leader of the group. He was known as Bo Teza (Fire General).<br>
<br>The BIA accompanied Japanese forces in the invasion of Burma in 1942. Japan declared Burma independent in 1943, Aung San becoming defence minister in a new government headed by Ba Maw. But friction soon developed. The BIA was replaced by a smaller Burma National Army (BNA) under Japanese control, and it became apparent that Burma was independent in name only. In March 1945 Aung San switched his BNA to the allied side, contact having been made through force 136, set up by the Special Operations Executive in the war against Japan. On 16 May he had a crucial meeting with General Sir William Slim, who decided: &#145;I could do business with Aung San&#146;  (Slim, <span class="italic">Defeat into Victory</span>, 1956, 512). To avoid facing potentially hostile forces in Burma after Japan's defeat, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, supreme allied commander in south-east Asia, recognized the BNA and its political wing, the Anti-Fascist Organization. This was controversial. For many on the allied side Aung San's forces were a &#145;traitor army&#146; and Aung San a war criminal guilty of executing a village headman in 1942.<br>
<br>After the war the BNA was disbanded and a new army raised on British lines. Led by Aung San, the Anti-Fascist Organization became the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL). It had a paramilitary wing, the People's Volunteer Organization, more heavily armed than the returning British realized. The AFPFL flexed its muscles during 1946 by means of mass rallies in Rangoon. Rejecting Britain's extended timetable for Burma's independence, the AFPFL orchestrated a police strike in September 1946. The AFPFL was brought into government, Aung San becoming defence minister and deputy chairman on Burma's executive council, and in effect chief minister of Burma. At the end of 1946 he led the main Burmese delegation for talks in London. Agreement was reached with the prime minister, Clement Attlee, in January 1947 that Burma would become independent within a year. In February 1947 Aung San negotiated at Panglong in the Shan States to bring most of Burma's ethnic minorities within a new Union of Burma, though the main Karen grouping stayed away. (The majority of Karens distrusted the AFPFL, having fought with the allies throughout the war.) In April Aung San's AFPFL won 196 of 202 seats in the election for a constituent assembly.<br>
<br>On 19 July 1947 Aung San and five of his ministerial colleagues (including his elder brother, Ba Win) were assassinated at a council meeting in Rangoon. U Saw, a rival politician, was arrested, accused of plotting to seize power, and later executed. Mystery still surrounds Aung San's death and there is no shortage of conspiracy theories. British officers were involved in the theft of weapons used in the assassinations. British commercial interests have been implicated. Other theories suggest that the Karens, Burma's communists, and even the Burmese military might have been involved.<br>
<br>After a state funeral in April 1948 Aung San and those who died with him were buried on 11 April at Arzaneekon (&#145;Heroes' Mound&#146;) at the foot of the Shewdagon pagoda in Rangoon. The anniversary of his death was commemorated for many years afterwards. A market, park, and stadium were named after him in the capital, and his picture was hung in many homes and offices. Some viewed his death as a tragedy, depriving Burma of charismatic leadership when it was needed most. Others believed he was too idealistic to provide effective government. Always austere in private life, Aung San was uncomfortable with his image as Burma's national hero. Many simply referred to him as <i>Bogyoke</i> (General). In a speech in September 1946 he emphasized that he was a man, not a god or a magician. He married Daw Khin Kyi (<i>d</i>. 1988), a nurse, in Rangoon on 6 September 1942. They had three children, including a daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi (<i>b</i>. 1945), who never knew her father. She later became a pro-democracy activist, opposed to the military regime in Myanmar (as Burma was renamed in 1989), and in 1991 was awarded the Nobel peace prize.<br>
