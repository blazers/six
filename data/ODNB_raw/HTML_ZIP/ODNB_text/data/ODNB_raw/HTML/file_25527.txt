<span class="headword">Sidney, Sir  Henry</span>  (1529&#150;1586), <span class="occ">lord deputy of Ireland and courtier</span>, was the eldest and only surviving son of Sir William Sidney and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1543), daughter of Sir Hugh Pagenham and widow of Thomas Fitzwilliam, elder brother of William Fitzwilliam, earl of Southampton; he was born, probably at Baynard's Castle, London, on 20 July 1529.<br>
<br>His father, <a name="cosubject_25527"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Sidney</span>  (<em>c.</em>1482&#150;1554), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the son of Nicholas Sidney and Anne, sister of Sir William Brandon, father of Charles, duke of Suffolk. The Sidneys were Sussex&#150;Surrey landowners who acquired wealth and local eminence in the mid-fifteenth century. William Sidney entered court through the patronage of his maternal uncle, Sir Thomas Brandon, a prominent courtier under Henry VII and his son. William Sidney lived with his uncle until the latter's death in 1510. In 1511 he attended Lord Darcy on his abortive expedition to aid Spain against the Moors, lingering after Darcy's rapid return to England in a visit to the Spanish court, where he was reputedly offered and declined a knighthood.<br>
<br>Some time before 1512 Sidney became an esquire of the body. For the following decades he pursued a career which combined martial and courtly pursuits. In 1513 he commanded the right wing at Flodden, for which he received a life annuity of 50 marks. In 1512 and 1513 he captained a ship royal and fought in battle against the French off Brest, where he was knighted, on 18 April 1513. During 1514 he was the agent of his cousin, the duke of Suffolk, in the Low Countries, where he had gone to learn the language with a royal letter of recommendation. He was closely involved in Suffolk's affairs when the duke secretly married Princess Mary in Paris. In the following years he served Wolsey as a messenger in French business. He was prominent in the tiltyard in these years, and served as captain in Suffolk's 1523 expedition. In 1517 he married Anne Fitzwilliam. For his career in later years the evidence is scant, but it involved service on investigating commissions and on juries during the Pilgrimage of Grace, and supervision of coastal defences. In 1538 his service was rewarded with office when he was appointed chamberlain of Prince Edward's household; in 1544 he was advanced to be steward to the prince. He was also awarded the Garter in 1542.<br>
<br>Sidney benefited handsomely from the royal bounty; as early as 1514 he had a grant in tail male of two Yorkshire manors, Kingston upon Hull and Myton. In 1521 he became keeper of the scales in London, a post he held for ten years. In 1539 he exchanged the Yorkshire properties for the lands of Robertsbridge Abbey in Kent and Sussex. (He sold off his inherited lands in Surrey.) To these were added in 1541 the lands of St Swithin's Priory in Hampshire. Finally, in 1552 his royal master gave him Penshurst in Kent. He had the keepership of the honour of Otford and Knole with an annual fee, and he shared in the disposal of the Brandon lands after Duke Charles's death.<br>
<br>Sidney fathered, besides Henry, four daughters: Mary, wife to Sir William Dormer and mother to Jane Dormer [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7836/', "Su&#225;rez de Figueroa, Jane, duchess of Feria")</script>]; Lucy, wife to Sir James Harrington of Exton, Rutland; Anne, wife to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9664/', "Sir William Fitzwilliam")</script>; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66355/', "Frances Radcliffe")</script>, wife to Thomas, third earl of Sussex. His wife predeceased him, dying on 22 October 1543; he died of the stone at Penshurst on 10 February 1554 and was buried in the parish church.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Henry Sidney was eight years senior to the young prince whose constant companion he became from 1538, when his father became chamberlain to the prince of Wales. He shared in the royal education and when Edward became king, the companionship continued, Sidney becoming one of the principal gentlemen of the privy chamber. In October 1551 he was knighted, significantly at the ceremonies attending John Dudley's creation as duke of Northumberland. Nine months earlier (29 March 1551) Sidney had married Dudley's daughter Mary (<i>d</i>. 1586). Northumberland obviously thought his son-in-law's closeness to the new king an asset worth acquiring. From Sidney's point of view his marriage meant access to the innermost political circle. His father-in-law made use of him in confidential state business; in early 1553 he was sent on a mission to France to sound out Henri II on the prospect of English mediation between France and the emperor. (Sidney commanded both French and Italian.) In the parliament of 1547 he sat for Brackley; in that of 1553 for Kent. This hopeful phase of Sidney's career ended with Edward's death, in his arms&#151;yet in spite of his Dudley ties, Sidney speedily disentangled himself from their misfortunes. He had a pardon from Mary before the end of July 1553, followed by a confirmation of most of his father's land grants. (He had to surrender a deathbed grant from Edward.)<br>
<br>In the new reign Sidney accompanied the earl of Bedford's mission to Spain to obtain Philip's signature to the marriage treaty. He probably owed this appointment to his language skills. Purportedly Sidney's private mission was to solicit pardon for his brothers-in-law. Sidney clearly gained Philip's goodwill, and on 30 November 1554 the king stood godfather to his first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25522/', "Philip Sidney")</script>. He would have been sent as agent to the emperor to report the birth of a royal child had that occurred. Sidney's acceptance into the Marian court may have owed something to the influence of his niece, Jane Dormer, Mary's lady-in-waiting and prospective wife of the Spanish envoy, the duke of Feria. She and Sidney were to maintain a correspondence in later years.<br>
<br>In 1555 Sidney found a new patron to his career. He accompanied his new brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22993/', "Thomas Radcliffe, earl of Sussex")</script>, to Ireland where in 1556 the latter took up the office of lord deputy. Sidney went as vice-treasurer of Ireland and second in command. Sussex spent long intervals in England when Sidney, as lord justice, was his substitute. In the two years 1557&#150;9 he stood in for the deputy some sixteen to seventeen months.<h2>
<a name="TheDudleyconnection"></a>The Dudley connection</h2>In the new reign Sidney realigned his court connection, now that the Dudley star was ascendant, his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8160/', "Robert Dudley")</script> prime favourite in the new court. He resigned his Irish office (to another brother-in-law, Fitzwilliam). Sidney was now enlisted in the Dudley following, a tie which would endure for decades. In 1565 he would write to Leicester (as he now was), &#145;I care not in regard of any subject your enemy in England but would be accounted a feather in your wing and a principal one too&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1547&#150;65</i>, 524). In Ireland, as a token of loyalty, Sidney would display on his personal standard the bear and the ragged staff of the Dudleys. Loyalty to his brother-in-law did not preclude good working relationships with other councillors, most notably Cecil and later Walsingham. Indeed in 1569 there was a negotiation for a match between Philip Sidney and Cecil's daughter, although it did not materialize.<br>
<br>Yet, even if Sidney benefited richly from Leicester's patronage, there was a price to pay. When Sidney went to Ireland he found himself entangled in the strings of his brother-in-law's other patronage dealings. The new deputy was perforce linked to Leicester's Geraldine prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, the earls of Kildare and Desmond, and correspondingly an enemy of the powerful Butler interest, privileged by the queen's favour to her kinsman Ormond. The hostility of the latter lord in turn frustrated Sidney's own Irish policy. Similarly the Leicester&#150;Sussex feud made attacks on his conduct in Ireland an issue in the partisan slanging match at court, filling the royal ear with allegations Sidney was ill-situated to counter.<br>
<br>In 1559 Sidney was soon pressed into the service of his brother-in-law Robert. He and his wife, one of the queen's ladies, were put to work as go-betweens with the Spanish ambassador, De Quadra. Initially it was Lady Sidney, who spoke Italian, who pressed the ambassador, in her brother's name, to back the Austrian marriage. There was talk of her husband going to Spain to advance the cause, or alternatively to the emperor. Then the death of Amy Robsart opened the way for Dudley's own pursuit of the royal hand in marriage. In January 1561 Sidney approached De Quadra in his brother-in-law's behalf, soliciting Philip's support for the match. He suggested that Dudley would in return back English participation in the Council of Trent, and hinted at the possibility of an entente with Rome. Sidney continued in this role for several months; at one point Dudley boasted that his brother-in-law would become a privy councillor and lord privy seal. Then Cecil, by dissuading the queen from participation in the council, spiked the whole intrigue. In May 1561 Sidney was dispatched to Ludlow, the seat of his new Welsh presidency.<h2>
<a name="Welshpresidency"></a>Welsh presidency</h2>Early in 1560 Sidney had reaped the first fruits of his attachment to Dudley, appointment as president of the council in the marches of Wales; a post he would hold until his death, in spite of prolonged absences. There he presided over a court with wide judicial powers which brought to bear the crown's delegated authority in an area where the common-law courts were imperfectly effective. The president was as much a political as a judicial figure. He had to deal with a clutch of regional magnates and greater gentry, whose preponderance in the localities echoed something of the traditions of a more unruly age. The greatest of these was in fact Leicester; and at least part of Sidney's function was to secure the earl's interests, and assure him of a leading role in local affairs, which involved a working relationship with the other magnates. Sidney was largely successful in maintaining Leicester's predominance in the region; the marriage of Sidney's daughter Mary [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13040/', "Herbert, Mary, countess of Pembroke")</script>] to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13028/', "Henry Herbert, second earl of Pembroke")</script>, in 1577 secured the co-operation of the weightiest of the south Wales magnates.<br>
<br>The performance of the council in its judicial role under Sidney was mixed. At the end of his first period of extended residence, 1571&#150;5 (after nearly five years in Ireland), there was a burst of criticism from the working members of the council which led to new instructions from the privy council. In 1577 John Whitgift, then bishop of Worcester, was appointed vice-president. He criticized Sidney, who returned from Ireland in 1578, for laxness in enforcing laws against recusancy, quarrelled with Leicester, and formed an alliance with Sir James Croft of Herefordshire, the malcontent magnate on the council. During Whitgift's term as vice-president (1577&#150;80) there was continued friction; the final years of Sidney's tenure were quiet. In general little was done to remedy the complaints levied against the council. Aside from unresolved functional problems, there was a perception that when the interests of the grandees were at stake judgments were political rather than judicial in character and inevitably favourable to members of Leicester's connection.<br>
<br>When Robert Dudley became active in the plan to occupy Newhaven (Le Havre) in 1562, Sidney was employed in the queen's business. During the preliminaries of that enterprise he was sent on an abortive mission to Paris to offer Elizabeth's mediation between the contending religious parties. Later he went north to explain to Mary Stuart that the planned interview between the queens was to be postponed because of the French crisis. In early autumn 1562 he accompanied his brother-in-law Warwick to Newhaven where the latter assumed command of the occupying English force, Sidney then returning home to report. In summer 1563 he was sent to Portsmouth to oversee provisioning for the beleaguered garrison at Newhaven. In the following year he was honoured with the Garter.<h2>
<a name="TheIrishcareerfirstterm15661571"></a>The Irish career: first term, 1566&#150;1571</h2>Another major appointment came in 1565&#151;the deputyship of Ireland, again thanks to Leicester's patronage. Ireland had in the last four decades become part of the English political scene, a place where aspiring Englishmen might make a profitable career, enjoying office and acquiring property. Leicester had staked out a considerable sphere of influence in the island and had played a large role in discrediting the previous deputy, the earl of Sussex. Placing an ally in office at Dublin was an obvious move. From the queen's point of view Sidney was recommended by his considerable previous experience in the island during Sussex's tenure of the deputyship in Mary's reign.<br>
<br>Although backed by Sussex's enemy, Sidney went to Ireland armed with a programme of action outlined by the outgoing deputy. In a detailed set of recommendations presented to the queen in 1562 Sussex had proposed the establishment of provincial councils, modelled on the councils in the marches of Wales and the north, each headed by an English president with a board of local associates. Each president would have a small armed force at his disposal. He also proposed the councils should use law codes which would blend common law and Brehon (Gaelic) law. This was a strategy which aimed at a bolder and more far-reaching effort than in the past. Sussex had limited himself to defending Leinster, in effect an enlargement of the pale. Sidney proposed to establish an effective royal authority and a meaningful presence in the Gaelic areas. The means were to be persuasive rather than coercive, but the new presidents would have a reserve force at hand to be used if persuasion failed.<br>
<br>Sidney's first tenure of the deputyship was divided into two portions. The first lasted from January 1566 to October 1569. His initial task was one inherited from his immediate predecessor, Sir Nicholas Arnold, who filled the office after Sussex's departure from May 1564 to January 1566. In 1565 the earls of Ormond (Butler) and Desmond (Fitzgerald) had waged private war, the last instance of such conflict. The earls, arrested for their offence, had been released under bond pending royal arbitration. Sidney set out to deal with this situation by creating the proposed Munster presidency with Sir Warham St Leger (the son of an earlier deputy) as acting president.<br>
<br>At this point English politics intruded again on the Irish scene. Leicester had patronized the Geraldine Desmond. Sidney attempted to balance even-handedly their interests with those of the Butlers, but the queen, solicited by Ormond and his allies, intervened in their behalf. (Ormond was a favourite at court, thanks in part to his royal cousinage on the Boleyn side.) Ormond objected to St Leger because of the latter's ancestral claim to some of the Butler lands. Sidney had to dismiss Sir Warham; no one was appointed in his place, while he had to arrest Desmond. Munster fell into disorder. At court Sidney's reputation was assailed by his predecessor as the Leicester&#150;Sussex feud flared up.<br>
<br>Sidney also inherited an urgent problem in Ulster where the O'Neill chief, Shane, was expanding his power. Elizabeth, as always, hoped for a peaceful (and cheap) solution, but she finally agreed to armed measures. There followed a campaign in which the O'Neill lands were ravaged but the chief himself avoided capture. Then an unlucky explosion destroyed the strategic fort erected at Lough Foyle. Ultimately the O'Neill problem was resolved, but not by the deputy. Shane, beaten by the rival Ulster lord, O'Donnell, fled to the Antrim Scots (the MacDonalds), his ancient foes. Seizing the opportunity, they cut off his head and sent it, pickled, to Dublin.<br>
<br>Sidney had been so depressed by the Lough Foyle disaster that he sought recall. He did indeed return to England in October 1567, his reputation at court somewhat repaired by O'Neill's death. Nevertheless, when he arrived at court, where Sussex's influence was at the moment strong, he was coldly received, his recent actions devalued, and his proposals rejected. His stand-in appointee in Munster was sent to the Tower while his schemes for reordering Ulster were dismissed. He had urged the establishment of an Ulster presidency and an earldom for the O'Neill chief, Shane's successor, Turlough Luineach. The queen instead favoured his rival, Hugh O'Neill. Sidney now suffered a severe attack of the stone, which disabled him for some months until he passed a stone the size of a nutmeg. It was presumably at this time that Sussex made his unsuccessful bid to wrest the Welsh presidency from Sidney, a move thwarted by Leicester. In 1568 Sussex went to York as president of the council of the north, necessarily diminishing his influence at court.<br>
<br>During 1568 various proposals were canvassed in the council, including the notion of planting English colonies, initially in Ulster but later in Munster as well. Sidney was accounted a supporter of such schemes but at the time avoided commitment to any one of them. Council discussions led to no agreement as to policy either in Ulster or Munster. By the autumn, grave disorders required immediate attention and Sidney, reluctantly, returned. He went with solid council backing and Cecil's active patronage but without specific instructions other than the observance of strictest economy. Sidney on his part was determined to press ahead with the creation of more provincial councils, for which he had royal consent.<br>
<br>Most immediately, a few months after his arrival, the queen authorized Sidney to summon parliament, the first meeting of the body since 1560. The legislative programme, approved already at Westminster, included some twenty bills, of which the most notable was that for abolishing coign and livery, the ancient right of clan chieftains to levy exactions in money, kind, or service on their dependants. Its elimination would shatter the whole Gaelic social order. It would deprive the chieftains of their power to make war; force would be a governmental monopoly. As compensation the dependants would have fixed financial obligations in place of the old arbitrary assessments, while the greater lords would have a steady, calculable income (while paying an assessed tax to the crown). A second bill attainted the late Shane O'Neill, a measure which placed large parts of Ulster in royal hands. Others dealt with fiscal measures designed to increase the scant royal revenues in the island. All in all, this constituted a coherent legislative programme to extend royal authority in the island and to advance the progress of Anglicization.<br>
<br>Almost every bill met protracted opposition, and what was to have been a brisk six-week session became in fact eight sessions, the last of which sat in 1570. In the end little more than half of the bills laid before the house were passed, including Shane O'Neill's attainder and some of the fiscal legislation, but the attack on coign and livery failed. Throughout, the members showed a growing distrust of the government. The palesmen's distrust of Sidney was heightened by the establishment of English colonies in Munster and even more by Sidney's encouragement of Sir Peter Carew, who successfully laid claim to ancestral rights in lands in the pale and in Munster. Such actions heightened fears of an officially sponsored take-over of Irish lands at the hands of English adventurers.<br>
<br>During the years in which parliament sat, the deputy had to face two revolts in Munster, one led by a brother of Ormond, Sir Edmund Butler; the other by a Desmond kinsman, Fitzmaurice, in which the traditional enemies collaborated. The former was driven to revolt when the earl agreed to surrender coign and livery in June 1569. Ormond, a courtier moving high in governmental circles, saw potential advantage for himself in ending endemic disorder, while for his brethren the measures spelled doom to their way of life. The Desmonds were in a worse state, their earl disgraced, alien colonists in their lands, and the success of Carew threatening their whole position. Desperate, they began seeking foreign aid. For the nonce the two parties acted together until checked by Sidney's belated arrival, followed by Ormond's appearance on the scene to receive the surrender of his kin. This last move was a blow against Sidney by his long-term enemy, since it implied the deputy was incapable of managing the situation. Sidney got his own back by an act of attainder against the Butler brothers, but even here royal intervention pulled the teeth of the condemnation. Sidney did lead the forces which broke the back of the Desmond rebellion, but Fitzmaurice sustained a guerrilla war which ended after Sidney's return home, and martial law prevailed in the province until 1571.<br>
<br>The queen had allowed the establishment of a Connaught presidency under Sir Edward Fitton, a Cecil prot&eacute;g&eacute; whose tactless inflexibility provoked an uprising. Ormond, with whom Sidney was newly reconciled, suppressed it. Sidney in the meantime sponsored another colonization project, in Ulster. He proposed that the lands east of the River Bann be occupied by English settlers, some of them discharged soldiers, others husbandmen and artificers, the tenants of gentlemen adventurers who would thus carve out their own estates.<br>
<br>By 1571 the country was relatively quiet and Sidney's recall, decided the previous summer, ensued. He was himself begging release. Fate was unkind to him. Beset by the disorders within the island, he was ill-supported at court. Beside the active enmity of Ormond, he suffered neglect at the hands of the council. Cecil frankly admitted that the affairs of the Scottish queen &#145;excluded all audience from other causes&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 63/26/57; Brady, 133). Sidney had also incurred royal displeasure by the mounting costs of his government. He had projected a saving of Ir&pound;4600 on his predecessor's budget. Since 1568 the queen had spent Ir&pound;148,000 and had accumulated debts of Ir&pound;73,000. Nor did she favour Sidney's encouragement of colonization schemes, which so agitated both the Old English and Gaelic communities.<br>
<br>Sidney was coldly received at court. Disillusioned, he begged Leicester to free him from further Irish service. Nevertheless, he was soon involved in ruthless attacks on the conduct of his successor (and brother-in-law) Sir William Fitzwilliam and from 1572 began a campaign for reinstatement. In pursuit of this goal he put forward a far-reaching programme of reform, devised originally by Edmund Tremayne, at one time his private secretary. Composition, as it came to be called, attacked head-on the vexed problems of coign and livery and of the cess. In this scheme, the provincial presidents would renounce cess, their rights of billeting, purveyance, and military service, for a fixed annual rent from the chieftains, who would in turn exchange their exactions on their dependants (coign and livery) for fixed payments. The English model of tax-paying subject and rent-paying tenant would come into being. The use of force would be a royal monopoly.<br>
<br>Sidney had a rival in his bid for the deputyship&#151;the earl of Essex, proprietor of a colony in Ulster. Their competition was fiscal in nature. As always the queen had her eye on costs. Essex claimed that the profits of his colony would soon yield an annual rent to the crown of &pound;5000, easily repaying an initial royal outlay. Sidney countered with a proposal by which, implementing his programme of compositions, he would render the Irish government self-sufficient within three years at a cost of &pound;60,000, to be paid by the queen in instalments. Elizabeth accepted and a contract was accordingly signed.<h2>
<a name="TheIrishcareersecondterm15751578"></a>The Irish career: second term, 1575&#150;1578</h2>It was on these challenging terms that in September 1575 Sidney returned to a country which he &#145;cursed, hated, and detested&#146;. Yet he was hopeful he &#145;could do that which has not been done before &hellip; where others had missed&#146;  (&#145;Sidney's memoir&#146;, 5.308). Landing at Drogheda, he summoned the palesmen and, in accordance with his plan, offered to replace the variable burden of the cess (money, kind, and service) for a low monetary tax. He was resisted and negotiations dragged on until 1577. The deputy fared no better when he approached the Gaelic chieftains. In both Munster and Connaught his demands were termed extortionate. It was only after repressing revolt in Connaught that he won reluctant consent to composition. In the meantime the angry palesmen sent an unlicensed delegation to London where, after a rebuke for their unauthorized action, they won a hearing. Sidney sent his chancellor, William Gerard, to counter their argument. Gerard, on hearing the palesmen's case, changed his mind and backed their complaints, offering an alternative scheme which would have dismantled Sidney's programme.<br>
<br>Sidney continued to face opposition; public opinion turned against him as the rumour spread that he had taken the whole country in farm, that is, in lease. Worse still, from Elizabeth's standpoint, Sidney was overrunning his cost estimates. Even in the second of the three years she had held back her payment. By Michaelmas 1577 Sidney had exceeded his original costing by more than &pound;14,000. The plaints of both the palesmen and the Gaelic chiefs, added to the deficit, destroyed both royal confidence, always uncertain, and that of leading councillors, even his supporter (his son's father-in-law) Secretary Walsingham. In March 1578 instructions for Sidney's recall ended his Irish career. He departed in September. This was the second time that he had returned under a cloud. But in 1571 he had at least laid the foundations of his proposed provincial councils. In 1578 he left a society in which palesmen and Gael were united in their anger. A keen ear could hear the underground rumblings of a coming volcanic explosion.<br>
<br>From the 1570s on the English government had pursued a course of action in Ireland which aimed at the Anglicization of that island, namely the full acceptance, at least by the Irish &eacute;lite, of English institutions, social, political, and legal. This was to be accomplished as far as possible by persuasion, backed by force, but force used only when inescapably necessary. Sidney in his two terms of office brought this process to a culmination, acting on the basis of considered, clearly articulated programmes, which laid out the means for its fulfilment. Yet in spite of a consistent and conscientious effort, his record was largely one of failure. Moreover, his departure was not merely a changing of the guard. It proved to be the end of the half-century effort, described above, to bring Ireland peacefully into the English fold.<br>
<br>How far was Sidney to blame? Some would see him as the architect who destroyed his own work by his advocacy of English colonization and even more specifically by his backing for Carew, whose claims seemed to endanger all land titles. Certainly the distrust this aroused engendered deep fears as to the intentions of the English government, and led to the defeat of Sidney's first attempt at a radical reform of Irish society&#151;the bill to abolish coign and livery in the 1569 parliament. His second attempt to achieve the same goal by the different approach of the composition programme of 1575 foundered on Sidney's high-handed impatience, which drove both palesmen and Gael to determined resistance. He had irreparably damaged the trust of the Irish (both Old English and Gael) in English intentions on which a policy of assimilation had to rest.<br>
<br>It should be said in Sidney's defence that he laboured under frustrating difficulties. Given were the home-grown problems of a dysfunctional, violence-ridden society. Added were those created, on the one hand by meddling interference from London, motivated by court intrigue, and on the other by the indifference&#151;or at least inattention&#151;of the council. It is hard to envision a recipe which would have ensured success.<h2>
<a name="Thelastyears"></a>The last years</h2>Sidney on his return took the seat in the privy council to which he had been appointed in 1575. In 1579 he attended with modest regularity; thereafter he was not to be seen at court. Whether his absence was voluntary or whether it was at royal command is impossible to say. In any case it meant that Sidney played no role in the centre of power either as councillor or courtier. These years were spent at Ludlow; yet even here he suffered royal rebuke&#151;first for too frequent absence on private visits, then for his leniency to recusants. He enjoyed, however, a personal triumph in these years. His opponent in council, the Herefordshire landowner and privy councillor, Sir James Croft, had his eyes on a local heiress, Barbara Gamage, for his son's hand in marriage. With the aid of Leicester and of his son-in-law Pembroke, Sidney carried off the lady and her fortune, marrying her to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25524/', "Robert Sidney")</script>, his younger son.<br>
<br>There was one more encounter with Irish matters; in 1582 Sidney's return to the island was under consideration. He made it plain he would only go if granted a peerage, the lands to support it, the dignity of lord lieutenant, and the company of his son Philip. The queen refused to accede to these demands and the matter ended. Sidney died at Ludlow on 5 May 1586. Fortunately he did not live to know of his son's death in the following October. At the queen's command his body was buried in Penshurst church, his heart at Ludlow. Lady Sidney followed him to the grave. She was buried, also at Penshurst, on 11 August 1586.<br>
<br>Sidney died a disappointed man. He had gained neither the grant of lands nor the peerage which were reasonable hopes for a royal servant who had held two great offices. In 1582, after the queen's refusal to grant title and land, he wrote a long letter to Walsingham, whose daughter was about to marry his son Philip. In it he recounted in detail all his years of strenuous service in Ireland and Wales. In each of his three terms in Ireland he had suppressed rebellion; in each he had expended privately Ir&pound;5000. Yet for all this he had nothing to show in material reward. A title was talked of in 1572, but without land. (Mary Sidney had written to oppose the bestowal.) Now, he lamented, he was forced to sell land to settle his debts. He was in fact disposing of considerable parts of his Brandon inheritance in the midlands.<br>
<br>Sidney's disappointment in his career reflects as much unfavourable circumstance as lack of ability. It was not only the intrinsic difficulties of the job&#151;the clash of two divergent cultures&#151;but also the meddling from the court and the low priority given Irish affairs by the council against which the deputy had, often unavailingly, to struggle. There was also the practical disadvantage of having &#145;his service subject to the ear and not to the eye&#146; of the sovereign  (Sydney, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.93). This disadvantage stemmed in no small part from Sidney's dependence on his brother-in-law Leicester. However generous the queen was to her favourite, she frowned on the formation of factional groups either in court or in council, based in this case on family ties. She preferred that Sidney should serve her in remote Ludlow or transmarine Dublin. He thus remained on the outer edge of the court solar system where the sun's warmth was hardly felt.<br>
