<span class="headword">Dougall,  Neil</span>  (1776&#150;1862), <span class="occ">poet and hymn writer</span>, was born on 9 December 1776 at Greenock, the son of Neil Dougald and his wife, Jean Moir. His father was a joiner and sailor, who was pressed into the naval service and died in Ceylon when his son was four years old. His mother remarried, and Neil remained at school until he was fifteen, when he was apprenticed as a sailor in the mercantile marine service. On 14 June 1794, during celebrations of a naval victory against the French, he lost his eyesight and right arm as a result of the accidental discharge of a gun.<br>
<br>On recovering from his injuries, Dougall began to develop a musical talent, and became a popular teacher of singing. He married Margaret Donaldson on 28 July 1806, and through teaching, together with a business as keeper of a tavern and later of a boarding-house in Greenock, he managed to raise a family of four sons and six daughters. His daughter Lilly achieved some success as a contralto singer.<br>
<br>Dougall composed about a hundred psalm and hymn tunes, of which &#145;Kilmarnock&#146; gained immediate popularity and became a standard melody in the Presbyterian church service. In 1854 he published a small volume, <span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span>, which contained twelve &#145;miscellaneous pieces&#146;, eleven songs, and thirteen &#145;sacred pieces&#146;, several of which he set to music. Among the miscellaneous poems are various imitations of conventional eighteenth-century pastorals and a tribute to Burns, written a few days after the poet's death. The most notable of the songs is &#145;My Braw John Highlandman&#146;. Dougall died at 7 Manse Lane, Greenock, on 1 October 1862, survived by his wife.<br>
