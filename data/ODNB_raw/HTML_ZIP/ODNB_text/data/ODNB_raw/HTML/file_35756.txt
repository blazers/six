<span class="headword">Rigby, Sir  John</span>  (1834&#150;1903), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Runcorn, Cheshire, on 4 January 1834, the second son of Thomas Rigby of Runcorn and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph Kendall of Liverpool. Sent first to the collegiate institution in Liverpool (which afterwards became Liverpool College), he was admitted on 20 February 1852 to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected to an open scholarship in 1854. In 1856 he graduated as second wrangler and second Smith's prizeman, taking a second class in the classical tripos. He was a fellow of his college for about ten years from 1856, and took his MA in 1859.<br>
<br>Rigby entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn on 17 October 1855, and was called on 26 January 1860. Starting as &#145;devil&#146; (junior counsel) in the chambers of Richard Baggallay QC, one of the leaders of the Chancery bar, he rapidly acquired a large practice both in chambers and in court, and in 1875 Sir Richard Baggallay, then attorney-general, made him junior equity counsel to the Treasury, a regular stepping-stone to the judicial bench. Rigby, however, was not content to wait; he took silk in 1880 and attached himself to the court of Mr Justice Kay, where he obtained a complete ascendancy both over his rivals and over the judge himself, who was susceptible to his brand of quasi-preacherly rhetoric. Within a few years he was able to confine his practice to the appeal courts, only appearing at first instance for a special fee. His fees in general were none the less reckoned moderate in view of his eminence. He was especially in demand for property and patent cases, where his chief rivals were Horace Davey, Edward Macnaghten, and Montague Cookson. He owed his success to his mastery of equity, to his ingenuity and pertinacity, and to an impressive personality which lent force to a style &#145;in which his fervid utterance seemed to contend with an almost pedantic desire to measure his words and give weight to every syllable.&#146; He was &#145;an incomparable advocate in a bad case&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 July 1903). He was on the bar committee from 1883 and in May 1884 he was made a bencher of his inn.<br>
<br>In December 1885 Rigby entered parliament as a Liberal for the Wisbech division of Cambridgeshire, but, following Gladstone when the party split over the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> (he made a powerful speech on the second reading), he lost his seat at the general election of 1886. He did not return to the House of Commons until July 1892, when he was elected for Forfarshire, presumably to enable him to be made solicitor-general, as he was by Gladstone on 20 August 1892; he was knighted on 26 November. He gave invaluable assistance to Sir William Harcourt with the intricate details of the <span class="roman">Finance Act</span> of 1893 but was not a success in parliament. His unconventional ways, apparent lack of humour, and somewhat uncouth exterior at first provoked the ridicule of opponents, and though he gradually won some popularity, his courtroom style was ill-suited to the Commons. Moreover, his utter inexperience in criminal trials exposed him to a humiliating failure when he conducted the unsuccessful prosecution of the directors of the Hansard Union in 1893. After a brief term as attorney-general from 3 May 1894 in succession to Sir Charles Russell, he was appointed on 19 October 1894 to the Court of Appeal on the promotion of Davey, and made a privy councillor.<br>
<br>On the bench Rigby did not justify the high expectations his admirers had of him. He displayed his accustomed skill and ingenuity in unravelling complicated and contradictory statutes; he showed characteristic independence and individuality in reaching his conclusions, and his dissenting judgments were sometimes found persuasive by the House of Lords. But his intellect, which was massive rather than flexible, failed to adapt itself to new demands. Near the end of the century his powers showed a perceptible decline, believed to be the effect of a severe fall. He at length resigned on 2 November 1901 and died at his London home, Carlyle House, Chelsea, on 26 July 1903. He was buried at Marylebone cemetery, Finchley. He was unmarried. A son of his cousin, Rigby Swift, became a High Court judge.<br>
