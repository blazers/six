<span class="headword">Lugard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Shaw]</span>, Dame  Flora Louise</span>, Lady Lugard  (1852&#150;1929), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 19 December 1852 at 2 Dundas Terrace, Woolwich, the fourth of fourteen children of Captain George Shaw (1822&#150;1892) of the Royal Artillery and Marie Adrienne Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Desfontaines (1826&#150;1871), of Mauritius. She had nine sisters, the first and last dying in infancy, and four brothers. Her paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25249/', "Sir Frederick Shaw, third baronet (1799&#150;1876)")</script>, of Bushy Park, Dublin, and a member of parliament from 1830 to 1848, regarded as the leader of the Irish Conservatives. Her paternal grandmother, Thomasine Emily, was the sixth daughter of the Hon. George Jocelyn, and granddaughter of Robert, first earl of Roden. Although the children of George and Marie Shaw were baptized in their mother's Roman Catholic faith, they were brought up in the Anglo-Irish protestant tradition of their father. As a young woman Flora Shaw had a crisis of faith during her mother's fatal illness; later she explored different religious traditions and found spiritual renewal in the beauty of nature. Identifying her heritage as Irish and French, she became fluent in French on visits to relatives in France. She closely followed the politics of Ireland, initially approving Gladstone's moves for home rule, but soon opposing; in 1914 she actively supported Ulster resistance to home rule.<br>
<br>Flora Shaw, who became the first woman on the permanent staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and its colonial editor from 1893 to 1900, had no formal schooling, but read widely in the library of the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. When she was seventeen John Ruskin, then Slade professor at Oxford, became her mentor and introduced her to the ageing Thomas Carlyle. She left home at the age of twenty, after the remarriage of her father, to visit relatives in France and Ireland, and, in the role of housekeeper-governess, to stay with the family of Colonel Brackenbury (a cousin by marriage) at Aldershot and then at Waltham Abbey. Encouraged by Ruskin, she wrote her first children's book, <span class="italic">Castle Blair</span> (1877), set in contemporary Ireland, which gained wide acclaim and was reprinted in numerous editions. This was followed by two novels serialized in <span class="italic">Aunt Judy's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Hector</span> (1880&#150;81) and <span class="italic">Phyllis Browne</span> (1882&#150;3), the former published as a book in 1881, and then by <span class="italic">A Sea Change</span> (1885). All four books were published in the United States as well, but she never again attained her initial success. After the failure of her novel for adults, <span class="italic">Colonel Cheswick's Campaign</span> (1886), she gave up writing fiction.<br>
<br>In 1883 a rented room in Little Parkhurst, a cottage in the Surrey woods near Abinger, became Flora Shaw's retreat from London and eventually&#151;remodelled with an adjoining cottage&#151;her lifetime home. Like many unmarried women of her social class, she undertook charity work in the slums of London's East End, where she became convinced that Britain's poverty could be solved only by emigration to its colonies. Required to earn her living, she took up journalism at the suggestion of her Surrey neighbour George Meredith. He introduced her to the editor of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, W. T. Stead. On Gibraltar, accompanying elderly family friends in the winter of 1886&#150;7, Shaw interviewed the political prisoner Zobehr Pasha, who claimed he could have saved General Gordon's life had the British government granted Gordon's request for Zobehr to join him in Khartoum. In her article, featured on the front page of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> on 28 June 1887, she pointedly questioned British justice. Within six weeks Zobehr was released and on his way back to Cairo. Shaw's apprenticeship under Stead, who conducted numerous newspaper campaigns to rouse public opinion, led her to view journalism as a form of politics.<br>
<br>In Egypt during the winter of 1888&#150;9 Shaw became correspondent for both the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. With frequent briefings from Sir Evelyn Baring, consul-general advising the khedive, she reported on progress under the British occupation. Back in London she continued freelance journalism. She began her long association with Cecil Rhodes, whose visionary ideas on the expansion of self-governing colonies within the empire she found compelling. Her opportunity to write for <span class="italic">The Times</span> came in the spring of 1890 when C. F. Moberly Bell, its correspondent in Egypt, who had been impressed with her abilities, was recalled to London as assistant manager. He told her, &#145;If you were a man you would be Colonial Editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> tomorrow&#146;  (Bell, 92). She began writing articles and, in November, initiated a fortnightly column, &#145;The colonies&#146;, which was to continue throughout the decade. Charles Mills, the London agent for Cape Colony, described her as &#145;an exceedingly clever, fascinating lady who has thoroughly studied and mastered South African politics&#146; and recalled how Joubert, whom she interviewed, &#145;was delighted with her, and could not believe that a Lady could know so much, and ask such searching and pertinent questions&#146;  (letter to J. X. Merriman, 14 Aug 1890; <span class="italic">Selections</span>, 2.8).<br>
<br>In order to recover from severe influenza in early 1892, Shaw sailed to South Africa. Here she went down diamond and goldmines, investigated labour conditions, and assessed prospects for agriculture. Her &#145;Letters&#146; so impressed the management of <span class="italic">The Times</span> that she was asked to report from Australia and New Zealand. After circling the globe, she returned to London in July 1893 to gain a permanent position as colonial editor at an annual salary of &pound;800, higher than other women journalists of her day. Macmillan published her <span class="italic">Letters from South Africa</span> and <span class="italic">Letters from Queensland</span> in 1893. With an assured income, she set up a household with three younger unmarried sisters at 130 Cambridge Street, London. She was generous in helping her family, particularly with funds for her nephews' schooling.<br>
<br>During the 1890s, when imperial rivalry among European powers reached its highest pitch, Flora Shaw wrote over 500 articles, leaders, and columns for <span class="italic">The Times</span> promoting British imperial interests. Later she assessed her achievements:<blockquote>To have helped to rouse the British public to a sense of Imperial responsibility and an ideal of Imperial greatness, to have had a good share in saving Australia from bankruptcy, to have prevented the Dutch from taking South Africa, to have kept the French within bounds in West Africa, to have directed a flow of capital and immigration to Canada, to have got the Pacific cable joining Canada and Australia made, are all matters that I am proud and glad to have had my part in. (Shaw to Sir Frederick Lugard, 13 Nov 1904, Lugard MSS)</blockquote>She coined the name Nigeria on 8 January 1897 in an article in <span class="italic">The Times</span> about the west African territories under the jurisdiction of the Royal Niger Company. The first woman to speak at the Royal Colonial Institute, she talked on &#145;the Australian outlook&#146; and colonial expansion in 1894, and on the Klondike in 1899. She also spoke at the Scottish Geographical Society and the Royal Society of Arts. Her younger contemporary Mary Kingsley described her as<blockquote>a fine, handsome, bright, upstanding young woman, as clever as they make them, capable of any immense amount of work, as hard as nails and talking like a <span class="italic">Times</span> leader all the time. She is imbued with the modern form of public imperialism. It is her religion. (Kingsley to John Holt, 20 Feb 1899, Holt MSS)</blockquote>The extent of Shaw's involvement in imperial politics became dramatically exposed in 1897 when on 25 May and 2 July she was called before a select committee of the House of Commons inquiring into Jameson's military raid into the Transvaal. She had to explain incriminating telegrams discovered between her and Rhodes, which raised suspicions that she had been the link in a collusion between Rhodes and the colonial secretary, Joseph Chamberlain. She deftly parried questions, protecting the reputation of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the colonial secretary. When gold was discovered in the Klondike she travelled for five months in 1898 to the Canadian far north and roused political controversy by exposing official corruption in the Yukon. During the dark days of the South African War in February 1900 she wrote four patriotic articles asserting Britain's sovereignty over the Dutch republics in South Africa, which were republished in several European languages as a propaganda pamphlet subsidized by the government. Exhausted by a decade of intense work, she resigned from <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 1 September 1900.<br>
<br>Flora Shaw had deep romantic attachments&#151;with Colonel Charles Brackenbury during the years before his death in 1890 and, in the late 1890s, with Sir George Goldie, founder of the Royal Niger Company; but there is no evidence that these relationships went beyond Victorian propriety. On 11 June 1902, in Madeira, at the age of forty-nine, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34628/', "Sir Frederick John Dealtry Lugard (later Baron Lugard) (1858&#150;1945)")</script>, then high commissioner of Northern Nigeria, and later governor of Hong Kong (1907&#150;12) and governor-general of Nigeria (1912&#150;19). Ill health in Nigeria caused Lady Lugard to return to England, where she wholeheartedly supported her husband's career through her political and social networks and by praising his administration in Northern Nigeria in her book <span class="italic">A Tropical Dependency</span> (1905). She accompanied him to Hong Kong and, despite illness, helped gain financial support for founding the University of Hong Kong, and travelled extensively in Japan and China. Her work for Belgian refugees during the First World War led to her creation as a DBE in 1916. A full partner in her marriage, she regarded both to be serving the imperial cause. She died after chronic illness at her home, Little Parkhurst, on 25 January 1929 and was cremated at Woking on 30 January. She was considered &#145;a crusader and an intriguer&#146; by historians of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, who stated, &#145;By her powerful mind and compelling personality she directly influenced policies and statesmen and did much to restore the somewhat battered image of <span class="italic">The Times</span> bequeathed by the episode of the Pigott forgeries&#146;  (Woods and Bishop, 158).<br>
