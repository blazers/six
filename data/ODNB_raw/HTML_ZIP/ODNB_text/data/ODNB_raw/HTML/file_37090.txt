<span class="headword">Lincoln,  Aaron  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1186), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was the greatest Jewish moneylender in twelfth-century England. Of his life before 1165 nothing is known. He was probably born before 1130, and if so, the place of his birth was probably London, with which he also had close associations in the last twenty years of his life. But the centre of his business enterprises was clearly Lincoln, then the major city in the north and east of England.<br>
<br>A Jewish community was flourishing in Lincoln by 1159, when its existence is first recorded. A loan to Robert de Chesney, bishop of Lincoln from 1148 to 1166, could conceivably date Aaron's residence in the city somewhat earlier, in the 1140s; he was clearly well established there by 1165, when Henry II's repayment of a loan to him marks Aaron's first securely dated appearance in the records. Aaron lent modest sums to the crown over the next ten years, but took no part in the London-based consortia of Jewish moneylenders from whom the crown borrowed so heavily and disastrously in 1177. Loans to the crown never constituted a major part of Aaron's business, however, and after 1169 he ceased to be a primary crown lender, concentrating instead on building up his own vast financial network of agents and clients from his Lincoln base.<br>
<br>It was during Aaron's lifetime that Jewish moneylending developed in England on a large scale, an achievement to which Aaron's own extraordinary success must have contributed greatly. Credit systems in England were already highly sophisticated by the 1160s, as the surviving records of the Christian William Cade attest. Aaron's operations, however, were much more extensive than those of any previous lender, Christian or Jewish. By the 1180s his network of financial agents reached into almost every shire in England; his clients ranged from the king of Scots and the great religious houses to the local parish priests of Lincoln; and his business interests involved not only mortgages, but also the purchase and sale of discounted bonds, pawnbroking, property development, and commodity brokering. He was also instrumental in establishing a new Jewish community at York.<br>
<br>Upon Aaron's death in London, early in April 1186, the king confiscated his entire estate. Most of his treasure was lost in the channel on its way to the king in France, but his bonds were sent to the exchequer, where a special committee, known as the Scaccarium Aaronis, was charged with their collection. Five years later, when the remaining bonds were transferred to the regular exchequer rolls for collection, they amounted to &pound;15,000 in face value, owed by more than 430 debtors. The total value of Aaron's estate on his death is unknown, but it may have amounted to as much as &pound;100,000 in cash, treasure, and bonds.<br>
<br>Aaron had at least three sons, Elijah (Elias), Haim (Vives), and Isaac, and perhaps a fourth son, Abraham. His brother Baruch (Benedict), his sister's husband, Jacob, and their son, Baruch, also participated in Aaron's business dealings, as did his own sons. All continued to live in Lincoln after 1186 except perhaps Isaac, whose house in London was in the king's hands by 1213. None, however, approached the eminence of Aaron of Lincoln.<br>
