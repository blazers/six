<span class="headword">Prentice,  Archibald</span>  (1792&#150;1857), <span class="occ">journalist and free-trader</span>, was born on 17 November 1792 at Covington Mains, a farm in the Upper ward of Lanarkshire, Scotland. He was one of seven children born to the yeoman farmer Archibald Prentice and his second wife, Helen, daughter of John Stoddart of Carnwath. Prentice's religious upbringing was Presbyterian, with paternal ancestral roots stretching back to the Commonwealth period. There is no contemporary description of his appearance, but an autographed illustration of him in the frontispiece to his <span class="italic">Tour of the United States</span> (1849) shows an earnest-looking man, bespectacled, with a broad forehead.<br>
<br>Prentice served as apprentice to a baker (1804&#150;5) and a woollen draper (1805&#150;8), and, despite his rudimentary education, in 1808 he received a position in the Glasgow textile firm of Thomas Grahame. Rising steadily in the business, he oversaw its move to Manchester, where he became a partner in 1815. As he settled into life in Manchester he married Jane, daughter of James Thompson of Oatridge, near Linlithgow, Scotland, on 3 June 1819. Meanwhile, participation in the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society put him in contact with Edward Taylor, the first editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and Absalom Watkin, both of whom were later associated with advanced reforms in Manchester. This contact with Taylor, who invited him to write for his paper, introduced Prentice to journalism and the importance of newspapers as shapers of public opinion. Prentice's editorials for the paper advanced the reforms of Jeremy Bentham, and especially the movement for free trade.<br>
<br>Impatient with Taylor's cautious approach to reform, in 1824 Prentice established a rival journal, the <span class="italic">Manchester Gazette</span>, later renamed the <span class="italic">Manchester Times</span>. Against the background of the Peterloo massacre of 1819, Prentice joined a growing number of editors of provincial weeklies who were attempting to mould popular thinking about economic distress and the need for parliamentary reform. Prentice, in particular, tried to merge the interests of both manufacturers and workers. In arguing against governmental waste, for example, he said that such inefficiencies simultaneously reduced the value of workers' wages and stifled the entrepreneurial efforts of the manufacturers. Similarly, he attacked the 1815 corn law because it raised the price of bread for the poor while inhibiting employment and industrial expansion.<br>
<br>Prentice's ardent devotion to reform efforts, however, proved to be his undoing as a commercially successful newspaperman. Although his newspapers turned a profit in their early years, his single-minded use of them for reformist causes, to the exclusion of lighter and more attractive features, drove down circulation, and his propagandizing alienated many. This partly explains the <span class="italic">Manchester Gazette</span>'s failure in 1828 and the subsequent inability of the <span class="italic">Manchester Times</span> to compete with John Bright's more moderate <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner</span>.<br>
<br>Although Prentice supported a variety of reforms, he made his reputation as a founder of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>. In 1838 the free-trade campaign began in earnest in Manchester when Prentice joined six others to form the Anti-Corn Law Association (later League). Notwithstanding his identification with its work, questions have arisen about his true prominence in the organization  (McCord, 34, 35). Certainly he was its leading publicist and later wrote the <span class="italic">History of the Anti-Corn Law League</span>. However, he did not serve in any leadership capacity and was at odds with other members, especially Richard Cobden. In 1841, for example, when the tories assumed office, Cobden had to restrain Prentice from pressing greater demands on Robert Peel for tariff reform. Similarly, as league moderates strove to focus on repeal, Prentice and other extremists were accused of diverting the public's attention to other reform issues.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Prentice's contribution to the anti-corn law effort was well recognized by contemporaries. Cobden's view of him as an earnest, hard-working, and principled man did not, however, go far enough for Prentice's long-time friend, John Childs. Annoyed that Bright and others had set up the rival <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner</span> in 1846 against Prentice's <span class="italic">Times</span>, Childs pointed out that Prentice had devoted his life to the league and wondered what Cobden and Bright would have done without him.<br>
<br>As a reformer Prentice derived his inspiration from several sources. His dissenting background led him to favour religious toleration and to support Catholic emancipation and an end to the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>. He encouraged temperance, even total abstinence, and was later treasurer of the Manchester Temperance League. He was also an early supporter of parliamentary reform and eventually joined Joseph Sturge's complete suffrage movement in 1841. However, as a hard-headed follower of Bentham's educational reform ideas he advocated a literacy test for voting. He sponsored mechanics' institutes for Manchester's workers as well as elementary education, although as a Presbyterian he opposed any curricula lacking religious instruction.<br>
<br>Also consistent with Prentice's middle-class radicalism was his desire to reach out to the working class. This gesture was not reciprocated by the unenfranchised, who distrusted Prentice's intentions, believing that he was more committed to the manufacturers than to the operatives. In 1830, when Prentice helped form a shopkeeper-dominated political union favouring piecemeal parliamentary reform, the workers established their own union calling for universal suffrage, annual parliaments, and vote by ballot. Also, despite Prentice's pledge that corn law repeal would benefit both masters and men, Chartists viewed him with suspicion.<br>
<br>It has been suggested that Prentice's estrangement from the workers was due, in part, to his inability to speak to them in a language they understood. Although he claimed to speak for the workers, he had the habit of addressing them in a condescending, even scolding, tone. William Cobbett described him and his friends as priggish, while Bentham had to admit that he was well intentioned but &#145;juggical&#146;  (Read, 60). Prentice's criticism of aspects of the new poor law and his sensitivity to the plight of the workers did not change the perception of him as cold and antiseptic.<br>
<br>Unable to compete for readers with the <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner</span>, Prentice left <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1847. A brief tour of the United States in 1847 followed, which was later recounted in his <span class="italic">A Tour of the United States</span>, published in 1849. Upon his return from America, his impecunious state forced him to seek employment at the Manchester gas office, where he received an annual salary of &pound;150. This income provided him the security to continue his writing, which took the form of <span class="italic">Historical Sketches and Personal Recollections of Manchester from 1792 to 1832</span>, published in 1851, and his <span class="italic">History of the Anti-Corn Law League</span>, which appeared in 1853. Although modern and more objective accounts have eclipsed Prentice's work, no other contemporary work has provided such a detailed record of the league's activities.<br>
<br>In Prentice's later years he and his wife were supported by an annuity of &pound;100 provided by friends and admirers. He died in Manchester on 22 December 1857 of what has been described as brain congestion  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and was buried at Rusholme Road cemetery, Manchester.<br>
