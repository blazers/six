<span class="headword">Cowan,  Samuel Tertius</span>  (1905&#150;1976), <span class="occ">bacteriologist</span>, was born Samuel Cowan at 87 Monton Road, Eccles, Lancashire, on 24 September 1905, the only child of Samuel Cowan (1875&#150;1941), a Manchester optician, and his wife, Emily Woods (1879&#150;1964). The third in direct line to bear the name Samuel, Cowan's middle name, Tertius, was added in 1926. His early life was spent near Lytham St Anne's, and he was educated mainly at nearby Buxton College. After studying at a Manchester crammer, in 1924 he went to Manchester University to study medicine, qualifying MB ChB in 1930 and MRCS LRCP in 1931. Later he obtained an MD (1933) and DSc (1953) from Manchester and fellowship of the Royal Society of Pathologists (1963).<br>
<br>In 1931, Cowan became house physician to F. E. Tylecote, professor of systematic medicine at Manchester Royal Infirmary, but he had probably already found an interest in pathology because within the year he became assistant resident medical officer and resident clinical pathologist there. In 1932 he was awarded a Dickinson memorial research scholarship in the bacteriology department at the university, and it was during this period of research that his enthusiasm was fired for the first time. Following the expiration of his scholarship Cowan spent a few months in medical practice but soon realized that his real interest lay in medical bacteriology. He returned to Manchester University, obtaining the diploma in bacteriology in 1934; he was then appointed research assistant in bacteriology at the university. A year later he moved to Hammersmith to the British Postgraduate Medical School.<br>
<br>In 1936 Cowan's research abilities led to his appointment as junior Freedom research fellow at the London Hospital. In the same year, on 20 June, he married Nancy Lingard Heathcott (<i>b</i>. 1909/10) of Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire. They had three children, a boy and two girls. A strong family man he enjoyed a very happy marriage and family life. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was lecturer in bacteriology at Manchester, a position to which he returned after five years of military service. During the war he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps rising to the rank of major.<br>
<br>In 1947 Cowan was appointed curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) then housed at the Lister Institute at Elstree to where it had been hastily removed at the outbreak of war. Space was limited and the collection was in some disarray. In 1949, when the collection was moved to the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale, Cowan embarked on a major programme of reorganization and rationalization that was to make NCTC one of the foremost collections of human and animal pathogenic bacteria in the world. At the same time Cowan played a major advisory role in the development of a rational policy for other British culture collections and, with others, he co-ordinated the system of Commonwealth culture collections which formed a collaborative body in the post-war years; a precursor in many ways of the World Federation of Culture Collections. In addition to the curatorship of NCTC, a position he held until his retirement, Cowan also served as director of the Public Health Laboratory (1961&#150;1964) and deputy director of the Public Health Laboratory Service (1964&#150;7). In those latter roles he displayed, in the words of Sir James Howie, &#145;qualities of loyalty, perception and diplomacy which made him a wise and acceptable administrator&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 9 Oct 1976, 888).<br>
<br>In addition to his scientific work in diagnostic and systematic bacteriology Cowan had a deep interest in the philosophy of science. He was a prolific writer with the ability to express his information and ideas clearly and logically and often, unusual in scientific literature, with humour. He had an international reputation for his book, with K. J. Steel, <span class="italic">Manual for the Identification of Medical Bacteria</span> (1965, 1974) and he wrote a unique volume, <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Microbial Taxonomic Usage</span> (1968). These works summarized many of his contributions to the philosophy of bacterial systematics&#151;contributions that ensured him a place in the history of bacterial taxonomy.<br>
<br>A man of slender build and kindly demeanour with twinkling eyes, Cowan was an excellent lecturer and teacher. He was unfailingly helpful to those who sought his advice. His qualities of courtesy, diplomacy, and open mindedness together with his strict scientific standards made him a highly respected member of national and international organizations. Somewhat deaf, Cowan made good use of his hearing aid when discussions became repetitive or sterile. He held a number of offices in the Society for General Microbiology and was made an honorary member in 1971. With others he was involved in the preparation of the first international bacteriological code of nomenclature, approved at the Congress of Microbiology in 1947. He served in several capacities on the international committee on bacteriological nomenclature (now the international committee on systematic bacteriology) and was elected life member in 1966. A trustee and member of the editorial board of Bergey's Manual Trust he played a key role in the production of the eighth edition of the standard international compilation, <span class="italic">Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology</span> (1974). His last contribution to bacteriology was an objective account of the problems involved in such an international venture which was read by the president of the Society for General Microbiology in January 1977.<br>
<br>In 1967 Cowan retired to the quiet country village of Queen Camel, near Yeovil, Somerset, but he remained active in bacteriological affairs in a much valued advisory capacity and by his writing. A railway enthusiast since boyhood, his last appointment was as curator of the Somerset and Dorset Railway Museum. He died suddenly of a heart attack in Hereford General Hospital on 24 September 1976 while on a visit with his wife to the town. He was cremated on 1 October 1976 and his ashes were scattered in the garden of his beloved Peacock Cottage in Queen Camel.<br>
