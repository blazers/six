<span class="headword">Sheriff,  Lawrence</span>  (<em>c.</em>1515&#150;1567), <span class="occ">benefactor of Rugby School</span>, was probably born in Rugby or nearby, the son of a wealthy yeoman family. After serving his apprenticeship he became a full member of the Grocers' Company about 1541, living in Newgate Street, London. He built up a prosperous trade in spices, supplying Princess Elizabeth's house at Hatfield during the 1550s. His loyalty is demonstrated by an incident which took place in the Rose tavern, Newgate, in 1554. Farrer, a haberdasher, accused the princess of being involved in Wyatt's rebellion: &#145;Some of them hope that she shall have the crown, but she, and they, I trust, shall hop headless or be fried with faggots, before she come to it&#146;  (Foxe, 3.951). Sheriff protested strongly and took the case before Bishop Bonner who, in the political and religious climate of the time, tried to appease both parties.<br>
<br>Sheriff's loyalty ultimately paid off and in 1559 he was granted a coat of arms bearing the griffin, a mythical beast which supposedly guards the treasures of the East. In 1561, he presented the queen with &#145;a sugar loaf, a box of ginger, a box of nutmeg and a pound of cinnamon&#146; as a new year's gift, and in return he received &#145;one gilt salt with a cover (weighing) seven ounces&#146;. In 1566 he was elected vice-warden of the Grocers' Company. On 22 July 1567 he made his will in which he describes himself as &#145;sick of body&#146;. His request was to be buried in St Andrew's Church, Rugby, though in fact it appears that he was buried in Christ Church Greyfriars, the old Greyfriars Church, which was destroyed in the great fire of London in 1666. A surviving parish register records that he was buried on 16 September 1567. In his will, among other bequests, he gave to his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1579), his &#145;grey ambling nagge&#146;, his &#145;chayne of gold weighing twenty ounces&#146; and his &#145;gold ring with a picture of death uppon it&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/49).<br>
<br>Sheriff's will also set out his intent to endow &#145;a free grammar schoole &hellip; to serve chiefly for the children of Rugby and &hellip; of other places thereunto adjoyneing&#146;, to be called &#145;the free schoole of Lawrence Sheriffe&#146;. Bequests of a charitable nature were not uncommon in the sixteenth century, particularly from one of new wealth and with no hereditary estates to maintain. Protestantism emphasized the importance of education as a means to religious enlightenment, although the desire to perpetuate his name may have been no small inducement. There was to be money for &#145;a fayre and convenyient schoole house&#146;, and also for &#145;meet and distincte lodgeings for four poor men&#146; to be built nearby, the foundation of today's almshouses. A schoolmaster was provided for with a yearly salary of &pound;12. The four poor men were to have &#145;sevenpence by the week&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/49). These ventures were to be endowed with all Sheriff's lands in Warwickshire, though, as this would not be sufficient, he added a further &pound;100 for more land to be bought locally. On 31 August 1567, Sheriff added a codicil which revoked the grant of &pound;100 and instead bestowed upon the school 24 acres of land in Holborn, only half a mile from the city of London. The rents from this have helped to sustain Rugby School and Lawrence Sheriff School to this day.<br>
