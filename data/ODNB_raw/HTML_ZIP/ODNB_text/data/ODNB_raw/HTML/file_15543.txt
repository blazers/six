<span class="headword">Kilmaine,  Charles Edward Saul Jennings  de</span>  (1751&#150;1799), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service</span>, the son of Theobald Edward Jennings, styled baron of Kilmaine, a physician, and his wife, Eleanor Saul, the daughter of Laurence Saul of Dublin, a distiller, was born on 19 October 1751 in Dublin. Ten years later he went with his family to France. After seven years' service as a junior officer in Austria, he entered the French army in 1774 and in September 1778 became adjutant in a legion owned and commanded by the duc de Lauzun. He served with this unit in Senegal in 1779 and in America under Rochambeau (1780&#150;83), and remained after it was reorganized as a hussar regiment; he attained the grade of captain on 24 May 1788.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war in April 1792 came rapid promotion. While serving with distinction in the armies of the north and the Ardennes, Kilmaine was named lieutenant-colonel on 1 October 1792, colonel on 9 November 1792, general of brigade on 8 March 1793, and general of division on 15 May 1793. But with the Jacobin government came growing suspicion of the political reliability of <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> officers. Despite his exemplary service, Kilmaine was suspended on 4 August 1793 and imprisoned on 29 December 1793; his wife, Susanne Kirchmeyer (<i>b</i>. 1764/5), was also imprisoned. After his release fifteen months later he participated in the repression of the insurrection of Prairial (20 May 1795) against the Convention. He was restored to his rank on 13 June 1795 and given a command in the army of Italy under Napoleon. During 1796 and 1797 he served in various capacities and participated in numerous engagements: the passage of the Mincio, Castiglione, Mantua, Valeggio, and Verona; he even served as the army's interim commander between 17 November and 21 December 1797. He was then recalled to Paris, where his Irish background, which had been a serious disadvantage during the xenophobia of 1793&#150;4 now made him a valued adviser in French plans for a descent on Ireland. In the spring of 1798 he was briefly appointed commander-in-chief of the so-called army of England. Declining health forced him to resign from the service on 30 December 1798. Kilmaine, who was divorced from his wife, died of chronic dysentery at Paris a year later, on 11 December 1799.<br>
