<span class="headword">Hilton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Case]</span>,  Marie</span>  (1821&#150;1896), <span class="occ">promoter of child welfare</span>, was born on 11 July 1821 in London. Deprived of early parental care, she was brought up near Richmond, Surrey, by her grandmother, a rigid Anglican who forbade her to repeat a visit she had made to the village nonconformist chapel. She persisted, however, and when, after her grandmother's death, she moved to London in her twentieth year, she joined Westminster Congregational Church, and was active in church, Sunday school, and temperance work there. Subsequently she was briefly at East Retford, Nottinghamshire, and from 1843 in Brighton. At Brighton she became uneasy about the ordinance of the Lord's supper and for some years absented herself from it, subsequently attending Quaker meetings. In 1853 she married a Quaker, John Hilton (1820&#150;1908); they had five children. In the early 1860s they moved from Brighton to London, where he was private secretary to the proprietor of a large manufacturing establishment: in connection with it was a non-sectarian mission church which claimed their active support. Marie Hilton was received into the Society of Friends in 1866. In 1868, following the 1867 cholera epidemic and the distress in east London consequent on the great strike in the shipping trade, she began to take part in mission and social work at Ratcliff Friends' meeting-house and the family moved to nearby Burdett Road. Impressed with the needs of mothers who had to be out at work, often leaving small babies with inadequate care, in the summer of 1870 she visited the cr&egrave;che at Brussels, which then catered for some 500&#150;600 children. Fired by this experience she opened her cr&egrave;che in Stepney Causeway on 22 February 1871, with 10 infants and 15 young children. By the time of her death it catered for 120 children.<br>
<br>Social work all too often went hand in hand with insensitive and sometimes aggressive sectarian teaching. Marie Hilton would have none of it and campaigned against &#145;the battle of creeds over the cradle&#146;, insisting that the confidence of the mothers could be won only by an appeal to their (sometimes hidden) love for the helpless and suffering. Her strong personality and intrepid courage enabled her to go into alleys where the police dared not venture and to enter, undaunted, the homes even of violent criminals if she felt she were needed. Her practical common sense, determination, and courage enabled her to overcome the mothers' fears and her opponents' accusations of pampering. She secured the patronage of Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Christian and the interest of the earl of Shaftesbury. Various auxiliary institutions were added to the cr&egrave;che, including an infirmary and a country home at Feltham, Middlesex. Marie Hilton, having a powerful intellect and considerable administrative ability, remained manager and fund-raiser, eschewing any supporting committee. On her death responsibility for &#145;Mrs Hilton's Cr&egrave;che&#146; devolved upon her husband, who was treasurer, until 1899 when it was transferred to Dr Barnardos.<br>
<br>About 1892 the Hiltons moved to Shore House, 19 Shore Road, South Hackney. Marie Hilton began to be troubled by acute gout and, after being bedridden for three months, died at home on 10 April 1896; her body was interred in the Quaker burial-ground at Wanstead.<br>
