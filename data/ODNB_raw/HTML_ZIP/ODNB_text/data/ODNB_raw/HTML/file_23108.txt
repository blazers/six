<span class="headword">Rand,  Isaac</span>  (1674&#150;1743), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was probably the son of James Rand, who in 1674 agreed, with thirteen other members of the Society of Apothecaries, to build a wall round the Chelsea Physic Garden. Isaac Rand was already an apothecary practising in the Haymarket, London, in 1700, though his apprenticeship formally ended in 1702. In Plukenet's <span class="italic">Mantissa</span> (1700) he is mentioned as the discoverer, in Tothill Fields, Westminster, of the dock now known as <i>Rumex palustris</i>, and described as a diligent investigator and a botanist of great promise. He seems to have had a particular interest in inconspicuous plants, and is credited by fellow botanists such as Doody and Buddle with new discoveries including the goosefoot &#145;Rand's oak blite&#146; (<i>Chenopodium glaucum</i>). He is known to have botanized with James Sherard, and with Petiver, with whom he was not on good terms, being somewhat critical of his work. He was a member of the Botanical Society that met weekly between 1721 and 1726 in a coffee house in Watling Street. Rand had a wife, Ann, about whom nothing more is known.<br>
<br>In 1707 Rand and nineteen other members of the Society of Apothecaries, including Petiver and Joseph Miller, took a lease of the Chelsea garden (owned by the manor of Chelsea) and were made trustees. For some time before Petiver's death in 1718 Rand seems either to have assisted him or to have succeeded him in the office of demonstrator of plants. In 1725 he was appointed to the newly created office of <i>praefectus horti</i> or director of the garden. Among other duties he had to give at least two demonstrations in the garden in each of the six summer months, and to transmit each year to the Royal Society the fifty specimens required by the terms of Sir Hans Sloane's new lease of 1722 (in his capacity as lord of the manor of Chelsea). Rand himself delivered the plants on many occasions. Lists of the plants sent for several years are at the Royal Society and in the Sloane MSS (British Library). Rand was in charge when Linnaeus, who was not impressed by his understanding, visited the garden. Dillenius's edition of Ray's <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> (1724) contains several records by Rand, whose assistance is acknowledged in the preface. William Sherard proposed that Rand's name, rather than that of the foreigner Dillenius, should appear as editor, but Rand declined. He also is mentioned by Elizabeth Blackwell as having instructed her and assisted with specimens for her <span class="italic">Curious Herbal</span> (1737&#150;9), which she produced at Chelsea. He is one of those who put their names to a certificate of accuracy, and a copy in the British Library has manuscript notes by him.<br>
<br>By 1727 relations between Rand and Philip Miller, gardener to the Society of Apothecaries, seem to have been strained, and it has been inferred that rivalry was the reason why each produced a catalogue of the garden in 1730. Publication of Rand's <span class="italic">Index plantarum officinalium &hellip; in horto Chelseiano</span>, a list of 518 plants used in medicine, was ordered by the society, and 1000 copies printed, as was pointed out by Rand in a letter to Samuel Brewer. The two publications may, however, have been intended for different audiences. In 1739 Rand published <span class="italic">Horti medici Chelseiani index compendiarius</span>, a longer alphabetical list of all the plants in the garden. He was succeeded as demonstrator by Joseph Miller in 1738 or 1740. Rand died in the parish of St James, Westminster, in 1743, some time before 11 May. His widow presented his botanical books and extensive herbarium to the society, and bequeathed 50<i>s</i>. a year for replacing twenty decayed specimens. His books remained at Chelsea. His herbarium was preserved there, with those of Ray and Dale, until 1862, when all three were presented to the British Museum (and thus later were moved to the Natural History Museum, London). Important specimens, particularly British species, were incorporated in the general herbarium, and many of Rand's specimens are in the Sloane herbarium. Rand was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1719. Linnaeus retained the name <i>Randia</i>, applied by Houston in Rand's honour to a genus of tropical Rubiaceae.<br>
