<span class="headword">Newman,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1783, <em>d.</em> 1860), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was baptized at St Giles, Camberwell, on 27 June 1783, one of two sons and two daughters&#151;Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1779) and Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1781)&#151;of Robert and Mary Newman of Windmill Row, Camberwell. He and his brother, George (<i>bap</i>. 1785), were together apprenticed on 1 October 1799 to Philip Brock, a lesser-known mathematical instrument maker of Fetter Lane, in the City of London. In 1807 John took his freedom in his master's livery, the Company of Makers of Playing Cards. From this time he traded independently, initially from 11 Windmill Row, Camberwell, on the southern margins of London. By 1809 he had moved to Lisle Street, off Leicester Square, Westminster, where he remained until 1827, trading as a chemical and philosophical instrument maker.<br>
<br>Newman's lifelong association with the Royal Institution, based in Albemarle Street, on the north side of Piccadilly, began about 1809. Accounts show that he not only supplied standard laboratory apparatus and chemicals, but also acted as laboratory assistant, cleaning and repairing the instruments. He helped to prepare the theatre for the demonstrations of Humphry Davy, William Thomas Brande, and other lecturers, and it was in connection with one such lecture that an incident of some significance occurred. On 22 February 1813, as the <span class="roman">Royal Institution Managers' Minutes</span> (5.353) recorded:<blockquote>Mr Harris the superintendent of the House reported that on Friday evening last, hearing a great noise in the lecture room, he went to see the cause of it. When he found Mr Payne and Mr Newman at high words and Newman complained of having been struck by Payne for representing to him his neglect of duty in being absent when he should have attended on Mr Brande.</blockquote>Payne was promptly dismissed. A week later, the minutes recorded (5.355):<blockquote>Sir Humphry Davy has the honour to inform the Managers that he has found a person who is desirous to occupy the situation in the Institution lately filled by Mr Payne. His name is Michael Faraday. He is a youth of 22 years of age and as far as Sir Humphry Davy has been able to observe or ascertain, he appears well fitted for the situation.</blockquote>Faraday was duly engaged.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Newman had applied to fill the vacancy. Clearly he had already developed a clientele that numbered some of the leading scientists of his day, as well as supplying the trade. In 1818 he made a copper water-bottle to Davy's designs for John Ross's polar expedition; it was a failure, though a sturdy iron sampler which he constructed for the chemist Alexander Marcet was sent on Edward Parry's first Arctic expedition of 1819 and appeared to function effectively down to 300 fathoms. Newman was also employed by the Revd Edward Daniel Clarke, professor of mineralogy at Cambridge, to make an oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, which was described in Clarke's <span class="italic">The Gas Blow-Pipe</span> (1819). In 1822 he made a standard barometer for the Royal Society, and later supplied similar standards to several major observatories.<br>
<br>In April 1828 the Royal Institution awarded the Fuller silver medal to Newman and allowed him to style himself &#145;philosophical instrument maker to the Royal Institution&#146;. Newman promptly moved into more prestigious premises at 122 Regent Street. At about this time he married Elizabeth, who came from Southwark. They set up house at 82 Albany Street, Camden Town, and raised two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Robert Hare, writing to the American scientist Joseph Henry in 1837, stated: &#145;In London you will find a great number of shops in which philosophical instruments are sold. The persons so engaged are generally scientific men &hellip; I do not like Newman, 122 Regent Street &hellip; he is however much employed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers of Joseph Henry</span>, 3.151). In April 1837 Henry bought a number of instruments from Newman, and described him as &#145;a &hellip; much older man than I imagined&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers of Joseph Henry</span>, 3.237).<br>
<br>Many scientists and explorers commissioned special apparatus from Newman; Sir Charles Wheatstone and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were among his customers, as were the major colleges and institutions. From the large number of surviving instruments, many of ingenious and imaginative design, and of first-rate quality, his high reputation was certainly justified. The citation for his award of the council medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851 praises for its originality, excellence, and perfection, his air-pump, the best in the exhibition.<br>
<br>Newman's son John Frederick joined him in business until December 1859 when their partnership was dissolved by mutual consent and Newman retired from business. A Richard Newman who signed a shop receipt in 1839 may have been his other son, but his role in the firm is unknown. Newman died at his home, 26 High Street, Camden Town, on 5 July 1860. His son's business did not last long and the premises were almost immediately taken over by the rival firm of Negretti and Zambra, about whose barometers Newman had made some disparaging remarks in earlier years. Newman's will showed that he owned or leased much property in Camden Town, Woolwich, and Camberwell, in addition to the lease of 122 Regent Street.<br>
