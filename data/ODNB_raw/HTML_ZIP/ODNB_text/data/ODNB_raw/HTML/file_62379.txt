<span class="headword">Essex,  Agnes  of</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Agnes  de Vere]</span>, countess of Oxford  (<em>b. </em>1151, <em>d.</em> in or after 1206), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47254/', "Henry of Essex")</script>, royal constable, and his wife, Cecily. Betrothed by her father to Geoffrey de Vere, brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28204/', "Aubrey de Vere, first earl of Oxford")</script>, Agnes was raised from the age of three in the earl's household. When she was six Geoffrey took her into his own care, but Agnes refused to accept him as her future husband. The alliance between their families was rescued by her marriage to Aubrey in early 1163. The middle-aged earl had no heir when he made this, his third marriage, with the twelve-year-old Agnes. Although she was not an heiress, she brought him five knights' fees in the eastern counties.<br>
<br>Shortly after his daughter's marriage, Agnes's father was accused of treason and defeated in trial by battle. As a consequence of the scandal, the de Veres sought to have the earl's marriage annulled. The case came before Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London. Agnes fought the annulment, finally appealing to Rome on 9 May 1166. While her case was being reviewed the countess had to endure the earl's displeasure; Bishop Gilbert rebuked Aubrey for having confined Agnes in one of his castles, denying her her marital rights and preventing her attendance at mass. The earl appears to have heeded the bishop, for the couple's first child was most likely born before 1168.<br>
<br>The de Vere case was among those Pope Alexander III considered as he developed the canon law of marriage. Although the extant papal letter does not discuss the specifically legal issues under consideration&#151;it addresses the earl's treatment of Agnes, and threatens excommunication and interdict if he fails to conform to the church's ruling&#151;the pope assumes throughout the validity of the marriage of Agnes to Aubrey. Among the contended issues, that of consent was foremost. The de Veres contended that Agnes's betrothal to Geoffrey invalidated her marriage to Aubrey. As Agnes herself had pointed out, having been raised by the de Veres as Geoffrey's intended bride from the age of three, she had no formal opportunity to consent to or reject the plans made for her. Yet before her twelfth birthday, Agnes had taken the unusual step of writing to her father to express her absolute opposition to the match with Geoffrey. The church accepted that action as sufficient to break their betrothal, freeing her to marry the earl.<br>
<br>Agnes and Aubrey de Vere had at least four sons and a daughter: Aubrey (IV) de Vere, second earl of Oxford; Roger; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28217/', "Robert de Vere, the third earl")</script>; Henry, possibly a clerk of his uncle, Bishop William of Hereford; and Alice, wife of Geoffrey de Say. She witnessed few of her husband's surviving charters, but they were joint founders of a small nunnery at Castle Hedingham, Essex (<i>c</i>.1190), and were benefactors of the de Vere priory at Earls Colne, Essex, and of the hospitallers, of which order the earl's brother was a member. Her husband died in December 1194, and the countess survived him for at least a dozen years. In 1198 she offered the king 100 marks for the right to marry whom she wished; Agnes paid the debt within a year and remained unmarried until her death, which took place in or after 1206. Agnes was buried beside her husband at Earls Colne Priory, Essex.<br>
