<span class="headword">Dixon,  Henry Hall</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>the Druid, General Chasse]</span>  (1822&#150;1870), <span class="occ">sporting writer</span>, was born on 16 May 1822 in Carlisle, Cumberland, the second son of Peter Dixon (1789&#150;1866), a cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Sarah Rebecca, daughter of General Tredway Clarke. He was educated at Rugby School (1838&#150;40) under Thomas Arnold and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1841&#150;6), where he graduated BA in 1846. He would have obtained high honours in classics had he not had an attack of ophthalmia, a disease from which he suffered for over twenty-five years. In 1847 he moved to Doncaster, where his father had arranged for him to be articled to a firm of solicitors headed by Robert Baxter.<br>
<br>No greater mistake could have been made, for Baxter detested horse-racing and campaigned for the abolition of Doncaster races, whereas Dixon had already become a lifelong devotee of the sport. At Rugby he saw Lottery, the greatest steeplechaser of the time, win the 1840 Dunchurch steeplechase, and reported this famous race to his form master as &#145;Lottery primus erat; Nonna secunda fuit&#146;  (Lawley, 79). While still at school, and later at Cambridge, he wrote on sporting subjects for <span class="italic">Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle</span>, so it was natural that after he moved to Doncaster he should spend more time writing on the same subjects for the <span class="italic">Doncaster Gazette</span> than studying for the law. In a short time he became editor of the paper, and from it was introduced to Vincent Dowling, editor of <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>; on Dowling's death in November 1852 he was offered, but refused, the editorship of <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>. He also declined the offer of a government post from Sir James Graham.<br>
<br>Dixon married on 12 May 1847 Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1824), daughter of Thomas Lynes; they had thirteen children, many of whom died in infancy. Among those who survived into adulthood was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46881/', "Sir Alfred Herbert Dixon")</script>, cotton spinner. In 1850 they moved from Doncaster to London, where Dixon was reading for the bar, living first at St George's Terrace, Gloucester Road, and then at Kensington Square. The same year he began writing regularly for the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, first under the pseudonym of General Chasse, and then as the Druid. Much of the material that first appeared in his articles in this and other sporting journals was later incorporated into his books <span class="italic">The Post and the Paddock</span> (1856), <span class="italic">Silk and Scarlet</span> (1859), and <span class="italic">Scott and Sebright</span> (1862). These books are important sources for turf history; they rapidly became best-sellers, and have retained their position as classics of sporting literature to this day. He was also a regular contributor to reviews and magazines. For many years he wrote the columns &#145;National sports&#146; and &#145;The farm&#146; for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>; he did biographies and leaders for the <span class="italic">Sporting Life</span>, wrote political verse for <span class="italic">Punch</span> and <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, and contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. Perhaps the two best articles he wrote were &#145;Cub-hunting&#146; in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and a memoir of the marquess of Hastings in the <span class="italic">Sporting Life</span>.<br>
<br>The Druid rarely hunted or betted on a horse-race, but he was an enthusiastic spectator of many kinds of sport, including coursing, cricket, and billiards as well as horse-racing; prize-fighting and rowing, however, had little appeal to him. He wrote &#145;rather for the amusement than the conviction of mankind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Baily's Magazine</span>, 18, 1870, 119) and his style was regarded as &#145;quaint almost to oddity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Field Quarterly Magazine and Review</span>, 1, 1870, 179). He collected an immense amount of information, to which he then gave a somewhat rose-coloured hue. Perhaps betraying their origins as magazine articles, and suffering from a lack of revision (which the Druid never cared to do), his books have a certain formlessness, and they contain a number of obscure allusions, but there is also a strong vein of poetry in many of his sporting recollections and landscape descriptions. Although many sporting journalists have tried to emulate him since, few have succeeded.<br>
<br>Dixon was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1853 and practised for a time on the midland circuit. While writing <span class="italic">Silk and Scarlet</span>, he was also, to placate his father, compiling <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Law of the Farm</span> (1858), which remained a standard work for over forty years. This awakened his interest in farming matters, and, following its publication, he began a series of articles on &#145;The flocks and herds of Great Britain&#146; for the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express</span>. He visited over eighty herds, and towards the end of his life he became more interested in cattle and farming matters than the turf. <span class="italic">Saddle and Sirloin</span> (1870) is his principal work on the herds and cattle of England. In 1865 he published <span class="italic">Field and Fern</span>, which brought together the results of a tour he made of all the principal Scottish herds. At the end of this tour he rode from the Orkney Islands back to his house in London on a half-broken mare to arrive home utterly exhausted in the middle of a snowstorm with the words &#145;Thank God for bringing me home to die with wife and children around me&#146;  (Lawley, 330).<br>
<br>The Druid had a reputation for eccentricity, arising for the most part from absent-mindedness and introspection. He never kept regular meal times, and displayed a marked indifference to money. Perhaps as a result of his numerous tramps, he suffered from a succession of severe colds, which led to asthma and then to bronchitis, and his health deteriorated. Towards the end of his life he was in considerable pain, aggravated by a polyp in the nose, and he confided to his eldest son that he would be the happiest man at his own funeral. He died of heart disease and dropsy on 16 March 1870 at his home, 59 Warwick Gardens, Kensington, London. His wife survived him. Few of the journals for which he wrote paid him, and he died a relatively poor man. His eldest son, Henry Sydenham Dixon (1848&#150;1931), became a noted writer on sporting topics.<br>
