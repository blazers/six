<span class="headword">Arbuthnot, Sir  Alexander John</span>  (1822&#150;1907), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 11 October 1822, at Farmhill, co. Mayo, the third son of Alexander Arbuthnot (<i>d</i>. 1828), bishop of Killaloe, and his second wife, Margaret Phoebe, daughter of George Bingham. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/608/', "General Sir Charles George Arbuthnot (1824&#150;1899)")</script> was his younger brother, and his uncles included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/607/', "Charles Arbuthnot")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/612/', "General Sir Robert Arbuthnot")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/613/', "General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot")</script>. His father died suddenly in 1828, and his impoverished mother settled at Rugby in order that her sons might be educated by Dr Arnold. Alexander entered Rugby School as a foundationer in April 1832; among his friends and contemporaries were Arthur Stanley, Tom Hughes, and Matthew Arnold. The influence of the great Rugby headmaster remained with him for life, and it was Arnold who recommended his appointment as a junior writer in the service of the East India Company.<br>
<br>Arbuthnot studied at the company's college, Haileybury, for two years (1840&#150;41), winning distinctions in classics and Telugu. He left England in May 1842, arriving in Madras on 22 September. The following June, after winning an award of a thousand pagodas for distinction in Telugu and Hindustani (Urdu), he was assigned to active service, first as assistant collector in Chingleput and then in Nellore. On 1 February 1844 he married Frederica Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1898), daughter of General R. B. Fearon. They had no children. In early 1845 he became head assistant to the registrar of the <i>sadr</i> (<i>diwani</i> and <i>faujdari</i>) <i>adalat</i>, the institutional precursor of the high court. Here he compiled and published a selection from reports of criminal cases which had been heard before the <i>sadr adalat</i> between 1826 and 1850, for which he wrote a historical preface. With his <i>sadr adalat</i> appointment, he also held that of secretary to the so-called university board, which had charge of what later became Presidency College; and in 1855 he published <span class="italic">Papers Relating to Public Instruction in the Madras Presidency</span>. This documented the developments in education since Sir Thomas Munro launched his survey of educational institutions in 1822, and coincided with the arrival of Sir Charles Wood's important education dispatch of July 1854. This fortuitous concurrence immediately led to Arbuthnot's appointment in March 1855 as the first director of the newly formed department of public instruction. Here he laid the foundations of the modern educational system for the entire presidency, organizing an inspectorate, opening district schools, and introducing the grant-in-aid system. He then worked out the scheme under which the University of Madras was incorporated in 1857. As one of its original fellows, and as vice-chancellor in 1871&#150;2 (he was also vice-chancellor of Calcutta University, 1878&#150;80), he was an avid champion of the policy of educating Indians to fill positions of public responsibility and service. The success of the educational system in Madras compared to elsewhere in India owed much to Arbuthnot's role in its early years.<br>
<br>In October 1862 Arbuthnot was appointed chief secretary to the government of Madras, at Fort St George, becoming <i>ex officio</i> a member of the legislative council. From 1867 he was a member of the executive council, and was senior member of the council when the governor-general, Lord Mayo, was assassinated in February 1872; Lord Napier went to Calcutta temporarily to serve as acting governor-general, and Arbuthnot stepped in as acting governor of Madras between 19 February and 15 May 1872. Having finished his term on the Madras council on 28 October 1872, he went to Britain on furlough, and two years later resigned from the Indian Civil Service. In 1873 he was gazetted KCSI, having previously declined the CSI, which he considered an inadequate recognition of his services.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1875 Lord Salisbury, secretary of state for India, appointed Arbuthnot to the governor-general's council. He returned to India and took up his new post on 6 May, serving under Lord Northbrook and then Lord Lytton. In September 1876 Lytton nominated him lieutenant-governor of Bengal, but, having resigned from the Indian Civil Service, he was ineligible for the post. Arbuthnot swallowed his deep disappointment and continued to serve as home member of the governor-general's council. In that capacity he was largely responsible for coping with the great famine which afflicted southern India in 1877&#150;8. On 1 January 1877 he took part in the great durbar at Delhi at which Queen Victoria was proclaimed empress of India, and his name headed the list of &#145;counsellors of the empress&#146;, a new order intended to function as an Indian privy council, but which in fact was never so constituted. He was made CIE in 1878. Much attached to the governor-general, Lord Lytton, he nevertheless exercised his judgement independently. In December 1877, due to dire financial circumstances, he objected to the reduction of duties on salt in Bengal and northern India, and consistently opposed attempts to reduce cotton duties, despite pressure from the Lancashire textile lobby. In March 1879, when he again voted with the majority against such a reduction, Lord Lytton overruled the council, and Lytton's veto was upheld by the Council of India in London. Arbuthnot also opposed Sir Louis Cavagnari's expedition to Kabul with a small escort, and in October 1879 his disapproval of Lytton's aggressive policy towards Afghanistan was formally minuted. Having supported the <span class="roman">Vernacular Press Act</span> in 1878, he strongly disapproved of its repeal by Lord Ripon's government in January 1882, although Arbuthnot had already left India by this time.<br>
<br>Arbuthnot's term of office ended in May 1880 and he returned to England, settling for the rest of his life at Newtown House, near Newbury, Hampshire. A generous local benefactor, he built a parish room and enlarged the village school before handing it over to the National Society. A staunch Conservative and churchman, he served for many years as a member of the Winchester diocesan conference and as chairman of the Andover division Conservative Association. India remained a preoccupation. In 1883, as chairman of the London committee to resist the <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span>, he spoke out vehemently and wrote against Ripon's government in India. He was much engaged in this period in journalistic and literary activity, regularly studying records at the India Office. Perhaps his most impressive publication, which appeared in 1881 (only a year after his return from India), was <span class="italic">Sir Thomas Munro, bart., governor of Madras: selections of his minutes and other official writings</span>. This, accompanied by an introductory memoir which was republished separately in 1889, stands as his monument. He was also a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, from its first volume in January 1885; his fifty-three entries included those on Clive, Wellesley, Canning, and Munro. His biography of Clive, written for the <span class="roman">Builders of Greater Britain</span> series (edited by H. F. Wilson), came out in 1898.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1887, on Lord Cross's nomination, he joined the Council of India. During his ten years' term on the council he steadfastly supported the reimposition of cotton import duties in India. Assiduous in attendance at the India Office, he was outspoken in council deliberations to the day of his final retirement, 31 October 1897. He had served for fifty-five years, throughout which he had acquired a reputation for administrative energy and for blending courtesy and tact with a somewhat despotic nature. His wife died in 1898, and the following year (6 June 1899) he married Constance Angelena (<i>d</i>. 1936), daughter of Sir William Milman, third baronet, and niece of Robert Milman, bishop of Calcutta. Arbuthnot died from heart failure on 10 June 1907 at 11 Duchess Street, Marylebone, London, and was buried in the churchyard at Newtown. At the time of his death he was compiling his own memoirs, which were subsequently completed and published by his widow, as <span class="italic">Memories of Rugby and India</span> (1910). No serious study of Arbuthnot has ever been undertaken, nor does one seem likely.<br>
