</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waddilove,  Robert Darley</span>  (1736&#150;1828), <span class="occ">dean of Ripon</span>, was born on 5 November 1736, the son of Abel Darley of Boroughbridge in the West Riding of Yorkshire, who moved later to Scoreby in the East Riding. He was educated at Westminster School and Clare College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a pensioner on 6 January 1755, before graduating BA (sixth optime) in 1759 and proceeding MA in 1762. Darley was academically able but, standing in line to inherit landed property at Boroughbridge from his uncle Robert Waddilove (1698&#150;1762), president of Bernard's Inn, he was not considered for a fellowship on graduation. Instead, having taken holy orders (deacon, 1759) Darley began a career in the church's parochial ministry. He was curate at Winwick, Northamptonshire, from 1759 to 1760, then moved to be curate of Wotton and Abinger in Surrey (to 1766) in the gift of the Evelyn family, and finally curate of Ockham from 1766 to 1771. Meanwhile, he had succeeded his uncle in 1762 and had adopted his surname from as early as the previous year, according to Wotton parish registers. It may have caused him to consider following his uncle's example and switch from the church to the law. Waddilove, as he was now known, was admitted to the Middle Temple on 25 March 1766, but went no further in a legal career. Instead, he was instituted on 2 March 1767 to the perpetual curacy of Whitby by Archbishop Drummond of York. The move raised his income and status and induced him to stay in the ministry.<br>
<br>Waddilove's frustrations in the 1760s were partly due to lack of a patron. That want was supplied by Thomas, second Baron Grantham, of Newby Park, near Boroughbridge, who was British ambassador to Spain from 1771 to 1779 and took Waddilove with him as embassy chaplain. This was the most exciting point in Waddilove's career. His scholarly gifts flowered and he also contentedly acted as an antiquarian courier for several British friends. He had access to the library of the Escorial, where he collated the manuscript of Strabo for Thomas Falconer's edition (2 vols., 1807), and obtained much useful information for William Robertson's <span class="italic">History of America</span> (1777), despite what Waddilove called &#145;the Difficulty of getting for him any really useful information in this country&#146;  (Waddilove to Frederick Robinson, 8 Nov 1776, Lucas MSS, L30/15/66/5). Waddilove also wrote remarks on the pictures in the Spanish royal collection formerly owned by Charles I of England, translated A. R. Mengs's <span class="italic">Essay on Painting</span> (2 vols., 1796), and was a friend of the Abb&eacute; Bayer, preceptor to the eldest son of Carlos III.<br>
<br>While in Spain, Waddilove exchanged Whitby for the vicarage of Topcliffe (and the curacy of adjacent Dishforth) in 1774, and appointed himself rector of Cherry Burton on 9 March 1775, both in Yorkshire. He held both until death. Once back in England, Waddilove married on 3 April 1781 Anne Hope (1746/7&#150;1797), daughter of Sir Ludovick Grant of Grant, seventh baronet. He also obtained additional ecclesiastical preferment. On 25 July 1780 he was collated prebendary, canon residentiary, and treasurer of Ripon, positions he retained on the vote of the chapter after Dean Francis Wanley's return from the continent the next year. In 1782 Waddilove was appointed prebendary of York (prebend of Osbaldwick, exchanged for Wistow in 1783), and archdeacon of the East Riding in 1786. He acted as chaplain for Archbishop Drummond from 1775 and was reappointed in that post to Archbishop Markham. Waddilove finally secured for himself the deanery of Ripon following Dr Wanley's death in July 1791. Grantham's premature death in 1786 deprived Waddilove of his main patron. He thereafter looked to Thomas, Lord Pelham (later second earl of Chichester) and the first earl of Malmesbury (Grantham's relation by marriage) for support when required, but it was insufficient to achieve exchanging the deanery of Ripon for the more lucrative equivalent at York in 1802. He was awarded the Lambeth LLD by Archbishop Moore in 1804.<br>
<br>Waddilove was an energetic, dedicated dean. Ripon Minster was well maintained during his long involvement in its affairs, in part a reflection of his own antiquarian learning. In 1775 he was elected FSA, and he contributed several papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>; <span class="italic">An Historical and Descriptive Account of Ripon Minster</span>, his most important work of scholarship, appeared in 1810. The dean was an active magistrate in the liberty of Ripon from 1771 to his death, and was a popular figure in local society. He was president of the Society for the Relief of the North Riding Clergy and gave generously to several other charities, as well as from his own funds increasing the endowments of parishes either in his own gift or that of the Ripon chapter. His wife died on 21 May 1797, aged fifty. Waddilove died at the deanery, Ripon, on 18 April 1828, leaving a large family. He bequeathed to the library of York Minster a magnificent copy of Falconer's edition of Strabo and the rare work <span class="italic">Bibliotheca ar&aacute;bica del Escurial</span>.<br>
