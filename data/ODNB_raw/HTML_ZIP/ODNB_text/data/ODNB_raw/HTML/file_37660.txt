<span class="headword">Brok,  Laurence  del</span>  (<em>c.</em>1210&#150;1274), <span class="occ">lawyer and justice</span>, was probably born in or before 1210 in Buckinghamshire. His first appearance in the records is in 1231, when he was appointed to act as an attorney in a Buckinghamshire case. By the late 1230s he had become one of a small group of professional lawyers practising in the common bench in Westminster. Such men spoke in court on behalf of litigants and also stood surety for them when required. They also performed similar functions for litigants in the eyre when the common bench was not in session.<br>
<br>In 1247 Laurence del Brok became the first professional lawyer to be retained by the king. Thereafter he received an annual salary of &pound;20 each year until 1262, and can be traced acting for the king in litigation until 1263. The main focus of his activity on the king's behalf during this period was the court of king's bench, but he can be found speaking for the king in the common bench as well. It is unclear whether or not he also continued acting for other litigants. From 1250 onwards he received a number of <i>ad hoc</i> commissions to act as a royal justice, and was regularly commissioned to act as a gaol delivery justice at Newgate and elsewhere. He sat as one of the justices of king's bench in Easter term 1271, but never became a regular justice of the court.<br>
<br>Laurence del Brok began acquiring property on a small scale in 1236, and over the course of his lifetime he spent well over &pound;1000 on property acquisitions. The inquisition post mortem held after his death shows him in possession of lands worth over &pound;60 a year. These are probably undervalued. Moreover the inquisition excludes both holdings in Middlesex that he had passed to his younger son in 1271, and the lands he is known to have acquired in Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire, and which are later found in the possession of his family. How the acquisitions were financed is less clear. He is known to have been in receipt of pensions from at least three institutional clients (the abbeys of Glastonbury and Ramsey and the priory of Durham), and probably received similar pensions from many other individuals and institutions. At the very end of his life there was also a suggestion that he was in receipt of bribes for the release of prisoners at Newgate, though this allegation seems not to have been proved.<br>
<br>Brok's first wife was Millicent, daughter of Robert Malet. He married her in 1242 or 1243, and she was the mother of his eldest son and heir, Hugh. He had married his second wife, Maud, by no later than Michaelmas term 1245. Maud was the mother of his second son, William. Laurence del Brok probably died a few days before 25 December 1274.<br>
