<span class="headword">Warner,  Samuel Alfred</span>  (1793/4&#150;1853), <span class="occ">charlatan</span>, was born at Heathfield, Sussex, the son of William Warner, a carpenter. His own fanciful account of his early years was contradicted by information later confided to Sir Robert Peel when Peel was becoming convinced of Warner's deceit  (BL, Add. MS 40555, fol. 160): this revealed that Warner's family resided at Faversham, but that he and his father were often away for long periods and were known locally as smugglers; and that Samuel Warner became friendly with a chemist in Holborn named Garrald whom he persuaded to move to Camberwell, where, perhaps, they devised around 1819 an explosive other than gunpowder for the so-called &#145;invisible shell&#146;. This appears to have been a submerged mine which detonated when a passing ship entangled and dragged on a line attached to the charge.<br>
<br>Warner then entered the service of Emperor Dom Pedro of Portugal, taking part in 1832&#150;3 in the defence of Porto (from which time he styled himself &#145;Captain&#146;). This episode was confirmed by two British officers who had also been there and who asserted that Warner had tried unsuccessfully to sell Dom Pedro his invisible shell. On his return Warner determined on selling his invention to the British government. News of the invisible shell reached a Mr Lufkin of the War Office and ultimately came to the ear of William IV. The &#145;sailor king&#146; invited Warner to discussions and encouraged his ministers and sea lords to investigate the whole affair. Demonstrations were arranged and assorted experts gave evidence to several parliamentary select committees. Warner's own testimony involved a rambling account of an expedition on board his father's ship <i>Nautilus</i> during the late war, when it had been hired by the British government for undercover operations against the French; he claimed to have devised the shell around 1819, and with it to have sunk two French privateers, leaving no survivors. However, the most diligent government enquiries failed to find trace of any such vessel or its logbook, or of the Warners' being hired for any such operations, or indeed of any prize money being claimed for sinking enemy ships.<br>
<br>As the experts failed to agree on the value of Warner's supposed invention, and one committee followed another, Warner became more truculent. He refused to demonstrate the shell before those whom he suspected of opposing him and he wrote boasting or defiant letters to various influential men and to the editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. The government found itself in a predicament: should Warner be ignored as just another impostor, or did he really have a secret of immense military value which must on no account fall into enemy hands? Warner refused to disclose the nature of his invention without a promise of &pound;200,000 should the device be found acceptable; the government refused to make any such promise ahead of disclosure. Warner threatened and wheedled, ministers declared their wish to see him treated fairly, but neither party was willing to budge from its entrenched position. More demonstrations were arranged; in February 1841 a party including Sir Robert Peel, Sir George Murray, Sir Henry Hardinge, Sir Francis Burdett, Viscount Ingestre, and Colonel Goodwood gathered by a lake in Essex where Warner blew up a small boat, without allowing the onlookers to see how it was done.<br>
<br>In 1844 Warner advertised in the newspapers his intention to demonstrate his shell off Brighton. On 17 July a huge crowd, swelled by many MPs and Londoners brought there by excursion train, lined the cliffs to watch a tug steam into view, towing the target vessel which, at a signal from shore, blew up and sank in full view of the spectators. The event was colourfully described and pictured in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. Members of parliament could not, however, agree on the value of what they had seen, for there was no clue as to where the charge had been laid or how it had been fired. Their doubts were fuelled by rumours from Shoreham harbour that the tug and target vessel had been connected by many underwater ropes, and moreover that timbers washed ashore from the wreck were found to have been sawn through as if to weaken the target's structure.<br>
<br>Warner's principal supporter at this time was Viscount Ingestre, who on 31 July delivered a long speech to the House of Commons arguing that the government had a duty to reach an agreement with the inventor. In the other camp was an equally vocal opponent, Lord Howard Douglas (author of the standard treatise on naval gunnery) who thought that Warner's invisible shell sounded remarkably like that described in print in 1821 by Montg&eacute;ry, a French naval officer.<br>
<br>Warner then claimed to have invented in 1835 what he termed his &#145;long-range&#146;, which could deliver a shell onto a target such as an enemy fortress several miles distant. His price for disclosing the secret of this useful device was also &pound;200,000. Eventually the government conceded a sum of under &pound;2000 towards his expenses in preparing a demonstration. Peel and his advisers assumed that the long-range was a fired missile but when ordnance experts attended the demonstration they found that the shell was to be delivered by balloon. It later emerged that Warner, under an assumed name, had arranged with the noted balloonist Charles Green to provide and launch a balloon for trial. This balloon had risen to a great height and burst, but when the wreckage was examined, the gunpowder was still unexploded. Not surprisingly, Green was never paid for his contribution. When the government-funded demonstration took place in August 1846 before the appointed observers, the balloon was seen to trace an erratic path aloft, dropping shot from time to time, a delivery clearly so inaccurate and beyond control as to have no military value whatsoever. By May 1847 Peel and Douglas were describing Warner as a charlatan and impostor and most of the house agreed with them. Warner then found a new supporter in Lord Talbot, who, as the editor of the <span class="italic">United Service Magazine</span> remarked in the course of a blistering attack on Warner, his fabulous early life and his absurd demands that he &#145;like Frankenstein&#151;has breathed life into this invisible shell. After the judgements of the Duke of Wellington, Sir Howard Douglas, Sir Byam Martin, Colonel Chalmer, and Captain Chads how could anyone be so credulous of Warner's claims&#146;  (Lord Talbot, 276&#150;83).<br>
<br>The last committee to be appointed never reported. On 5 December 1853 Warner, resilient to the last, died suddenly of apoplexy at 1 Bloomfield Place, Pimlico, London, leaving a &#145;widow&#146; and seven children destitute. He was buried in Brompton cemetery on 10 December, the cost of his funeral being met by a George Smith, and the local curate did his best to raise money for the support of his family. Even this family was not what it appeared to be, for Warner's real wife was found to be living on parish relief in Ashford, Kent, and one of his daughters was married to a clerk in the Stationery Office. The author of his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> described him as &#145;one of those monomaniacs who after repeated attempts to deceive others, are at length supremely successful in deceiving themselves &hellip; [He] maintained to the last that he was possessed of the secret of an explosive compound much more powerful than any in known use&#146;. Few such impostors have, however, succeeded in playing successive governments on such a slender line for more than twenty years.<br>
