<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lacy,  John  de</span>, third earl of Lincoln  (<em>c.</em>1192&#150;1240), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15861/', "Roger de Lacy")</script>, constable of Chester (<i>d</i>. 1211), and his wife, Maud or Matilda de Clere, erroneously identified as Matilda de Clare in a fifteenth-century chronicle. Since he was almost certainly a minor at the time of his father's death, and did not obtain possession of his lands until September 1213, John appears to have been born <i>c</i>.1192. His early years are obscure. The only possible reference to him before 1213 occurs in a letter of Philip Augustus, king of France, responding to an offer by a John de Lacy made in 1209 or early 1210 to foment rebellion in England and Ireland. This may, however, refer not to the seventeen-year-old John, but to the Anglo-Irish baron Walter de Lacy.<br>
<br>In September 1213 John de Lacy obtained possession of his father's extensive estate, comprising more than 100 knights' fees together with the northern baronies of Pontefract, Clitheroe, Penwortham, Widnes, and Halton, held by descent in the female line from the Lacy lords of Pontefract, and in the line of direct male descent as heir to the lands and office of the constables of Chester. In return for his lands he was forced to offer a massive fine of 7000 marks repayable over the coming three years, in the meantime surrendering his chief castles of Pontefract in Yorkshire and Donington in Leicestershire, to be garrisoned by the king at Lacy's expense, on pain of confiscation should Lacy rebel. In 1214 he accompanied the king to Poitou, being restored to possession of Castle Donington in July in return for the surrender of hostages including his younger brother. He was still at court on 4 March 1215, when he took the cross at the same time as King John. On the following day he was pardoned the 4200 marks still owing from his fine of 1213.<br>
<br>As late as 31 May 1215 Lacy was assumed to be loyal. However, with the fall of London he threw in his lot with the rebels, being named at Runnymede in June 1215 as one of the baronial council of twenty-five, and being entrusted with command of the rebel forces in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93691', "Enforcers of Magna Carta")</script>]. Thereafter he veered opportunistically between the rebel and royalist camps. On 1 January 1216, perhaps in light of the king's capture of Castle Donington, he sought terms with John, once again surrendering his brother as hostage and repudiating all the terms of the settlement embodied in <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. In April he was restored to possession of the manor of Lytham in Oxfordshire, detached from the Lacy barony of Pontefract for much of the previous century. In May he was in Kent with the king, but he had rebelled again before John's death in October. Thereafter, with the defeat of the rebel army at Lincoln, he once again returned to the royalist camp, being readmitted to fealty in August 1217. In the following month he was commanded to oversee the restoration of Carlisle Castle by the king of Scots. However, his thoughts now turned to the crusade, and in May 1218, in company with his chief lord, Ranulf (III), earl of Chester, he embarked for Damietta.<br>
<br>John de Lacy's activities in the East are unrecorded, save for an award he made at Damietta for the establishment of a chapel at Pontefract in honour of the holy sepulchre and the holy cross. He did not return to England until August 1220, still following in the train of the earl of Chester. Thereafter his fortunes were linked closely to those of the earl, an alliance cemented in 1221 by his marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2716/', "Ranulf (III)'s")</script> niece. In February 1221, during the rebellion of the earl of Aumale, Lacy was commanded to assist in the siege of Skipton Castle, and in the following year he was appointed to forest inquiries in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. In the winter of 1223&#150;4, together with the earl of Chester, he was among the leaders of the opposition to the justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, but made his peace with the king, attending the siege of Bedford in 1224, witnessing the reissue of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> in 1225, and assisting in the collection of the tax bestowed in return for the charter's reissue. In 1226 he was appointed a justice on eyre in Lincolnshire and Lancashire.<br>
<br>In 1227 Lacy served as one of the royal envoys to Antwerp in negotiations with the German princes, and in 1230 accompanied the king's expedition to Brittany and Poitou, receiving the manors of Collingham in Yorkshire and Bardsey in Lincolnshire in reward for his service. After August 1230 he helped to negotiate an Anglo-French truce. During the political crisis of 1232 he once again sided with the earl of Chester against Hubert de Burgh, in October being appointed to inquire into Hubert's escape from sanctuary and thereafter supplying one of the four knights appointed to serve as Hubert's gaolers at Devizes Castle. However, his adherence to the new regime headed by Peter des Roches was no more than half-hearted, and sprang principally from his desire to obtain royal favour at a crucial moment in his own affairs. Following the death of Ranulf of Chester on 26 October 1232, Lacy was permitted to benefit from an arrangement agreed before Ranulf's death, whereby Ranulf's title as earl of Lincoln was conveyed to Hawise, Ranulf's sister, and thence to John as Hawise's son-in-law. On 22 November 1232 John was granted the third penny of the county of Lincolnshire, and was thus created an earl. Although Ranulf's principal Lincolnshire barony of Bolingbroke was retained by Hawise (<i>d</i>. 1243), John acquired other portions of the Chester estate, including a share in the manor of Leeds, from John the Scot, Ranulf's successor as earl of Chester.<br>
<br>In autumn 1233 Lacy helped to defend the Welsh marches against the rebellion headed by Richard Marshal. The chronicler Roger of Wendover claims that John was bribed by des Roches to abandon the marshal: an allegation substantiated by the award to John of the wardship of the heir and lands of Nigel de Mowbray in return for a relatively modest proffer of 1000 marks. With des Roches's fall John none the less retained his position at court, emerging as a leading royal counsellor. In 1236 he discharged a ceremonial role at Queen Eleanor's coronation. In the following year, besides assisting in negotiations with Scotland and Wales and witnessing the reissue of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, he was granted custody of the earldom of Chester on the death of Earl John the Scot. His familiarity with the king, and his purchase for 3000 marks of the marriage of Richard de Clare, heir to the earldom of Gloucester, for his eldest daughter, Maud, are said to have been resented by the king's brother, Richard of Cornwall, leading to a threat of rebellion by Richard in 1238. Thereafter Lacy's influence at court appears to have waned, perhaps as a result of the prolonged ill health from which he is said to have suffered in his final years. He died on 22 July 1240 and was buried near his father in the choir of the Cistercian abbey of Stanlaw, his bones being moved to Whalley when the monks transferred there in the 1290s.<br>
<br>The fifteenth-century chronicle of Stanlaw credits Lacy with a first wife, Alice, daughter of the Anglo-Norman baron Gilbert de l'Aigle, who is said to have died childless and to have been buried at Norton Priory. Lacy's only certainly documented marriage occurred in 1221, to Margaret [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54444/', "Lacy, Margaret de, countess of Lincoln")</script>], daughter of Robert de Quincy (<i>d</i>. 1217), eldest son of Saer (IV) de Quincy (who died at Damietta in 1219), and Hawise, sister of Ranulf, earl of Chester. Although in theory heir to her grandfather's earldom of Winchester, Margaret's claims were passed over in 1219 in favour of those of her uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22966/', "Roger de Quincy")</script>, a fact that may have fuelled her husband's dissatisfaction with the regime headed by Hubert de Burgh, and which must have made his eventual acquisition of the earldom of Lincoln all the more satisfying. Margaret, who eventually succeeded to part of the Quincy estate in Dorset and to her mother's portion of the Chester inheritance, long outlived her husband. In 1242 she married Walter Marshal, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1245). A wealthy widow for the next twenty years, and a member of the friendship network of Queen Eleanor, Margaret died in March 1266 at Hamstead Marshall and was buried in the church of the hospitallers at Clerkenwell. Her son from her marriage to John, Edmund de Lacy, probably born in 1230, was permitted to succeed to his father's estates in May 1248, at the age of only eighteen, and by 1255 at the latest was styled earl of Lincoln, receiving the third penny of the county. In May 1247 he married Alice, daughter of Manfred, marquess of Saluzzo, a kinsman of Queen Eleanor, and died on 2 June 1258, being buried at Stanlaw.<br>
<br>Besides making awards to the religious, principally of Pontefract and Stanlaw, John de Lacy issued the first surviving borough charter for the men of Rochdale. His arms are recorded on his seal as earl of Lincoln and by Matthew Paris as quarterly or and gules, a bend let sable and a label of four points argent, derived perhaps from the Mandeville earls of Essex via the marriage of Lacy's grandfather to a Mandeville kinswoman.<br>
