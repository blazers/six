<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bligh, Sir  Richard Rodney</span>  (1737&#150;1821), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second son of Lieutenant Richard Bligh (<i>b</i>. 1713), naval officer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Page, and a third cousin of Vice-Admiral William Bligh. He was baptized in Holy Trinity Church, Gosport, on 8 November 1737, with George Bridges Rodney&#151;the future Baron Rodney&#151;as his godfather.<br>
<br>Bligh went to sea with Rodney in the <i>Rainbow</i> in 1750, and was a midshipman in the <i>Ramillies</i> with Admiral John Byng at the battle of Minorca in 1756. He was commissioned lieutenant in the <i>Nightingale</i> in 1757, and took part in Rodney's victorious West Indian campaign. Bligh was promoted commander by Rodney in 1762, and given command of the sloop <i>Virgin</i>. On 13 November 1765 he married Ann Worsley (1744/5&#150;1797), daughter of Sir Edward Worsley. In 1777 he was made a post captain and appointed to the <i>Camel</i>. He took, as an acting lieutenant, Bartholomew James, who recorded that Bligh treated him with civility. Bligh seems to have been a humane commander; the punishments recorded in his logs are few and moderate.<br>
<br>In 1782 Bligh commanded the <i>Asia</i> (64 guns), under Lord Howe, at the relief of Gibraltar. He was appointed to the <i>Alexander</i> (74 guns) in 1794 and on 6 November, in company with the <i>Canada</i> (74 guns), met a French squadron of five line-of-battle ships, three frigates, and a brig. The <i>Alexander</i> engaged three line-of-battle ships for upwards of two hours, allowing the <i>Canada</i> to escape. With the ship in danger of sinking and two other enemy ships coming up, Bligh had to strike his colours and was taken to Brest a prisoner. He had been advanced to the rank of rear-admiral in October 1794, but had not been officially informed of it. On returning to England he was court martialled for the loss of the <i>Alexander</i> but most honourably acquitted, the court very highly approving of the conduct of all the ship's company.<br>
<br>From 1796 to 1799 Bligh was second in command at Jamaica. He infuriated the commander-in-chief, Sir Hyde Parker, over his conduct of a court martial arising from the <i>Hermione</i> mutiny, during which Captain Hugh Pigot and nine officers had been murdered. The acquittal of two defendants, one a boy of twelve, and the recommendation to mercy of a third, led Parker to write to the Admiralty accusing Bligh of &#145;supineness&#146; and demanding his removal  (28 May 1798, TNA: PRO, ADM 1/248).<br>
<br>Bligh became a vice-admiral in February 1799, and returned home in September. His wife had died on 7 July 1797 and on 28 July 1800 he married Mary Golightly (1745/6&#150;1834). He was commander-in-chief at Leith from 1803 to 1804 and advanced to the rank of admiral in April 1804. He saw no further service afloat but was invested with the GCB in 1820. Bligh died on 30 April 1821 at Belle Vue, a mansion he had bought in Southampton. He was buried in the family vault at St Mary's, Alverstoke, Hampshire, on 9 May.<br>
<br>Bligh left a son and four daughters from his first marriage. His son, Captain George Miller Bligh, had served as a midshipman with him in the <i>Alexander</i> and as a lieutenant in the <i>Victory</i> at Trafalgar, where he was severely wounded. The daughters were Harriet Worsley, Ann Caroline, Elizabeth, and Sophia Holmes who married Charles Carter, who had served as a lieutenant in the <i>Alexander</i> and was later a vice-admiral.<br>
