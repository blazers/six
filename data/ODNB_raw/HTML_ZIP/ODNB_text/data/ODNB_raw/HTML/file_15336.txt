<span class="headword">Kempe,  Alfred John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1784, <em>d.</em> 1846), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in London, where he was baptized at St Mary, Newington, on 16 July 1784, the only son of John Kempe (1749/50&#150;1823), descended from an old Cornish family, who had succeeded his father as <i>porteur d'or</i>, or gentleman porter, at the Royal Mint. His mother, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1835), was the youngest daughter of James Arrow of Westminster, a descendant of a Berkshire family, which still retained a small estate there. Kempe was educated by two French refugees, from whom he and his sister Anna Eliza [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3291/', "Bray, Anna Eliza")</script>] received a good grounding in literature and the arts, and he was able to benefit from the family's wide circle of artistic acquaintances. He seems to have had no settled employment, although for a short time he too held an appointment at the mint. For some years he was a staff writer for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, for which he produced over two hundred articles on numerous subjects, mainly antiquarian and archaeological; from about 1840 to 1845 he was employed at the state paper office in transcribing and calendaring.<br>
<br>On 3 October 1808 Kempe married Mary, the daughter of J. Prior, a captain in the merchant navy, at Leyton, Essex; they had eleven children. Around 1809 he made the acquaintance of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26602/', "Charles Alfred Stothard (1786&#150;1821)")</script>, who married his sister Anna Eliza, and he was drawn into sharing Stothard's enthusiasm for antiquities. With him Kempe explored the district of Keston, in Kent, to which he moved in 1813. These investigations were continued with Thomas Crofton Croker (1798&#150;1854), and led to an article by Kempe, &#145;An investigation of the antiquities of Holwood Hill, in the parish of Keston&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Military Register</span> for 1814, and was also appended to John Dunkin's <span class="italic">Outlines of the History and Antiquities of Bromley in Kent</span> of 1815. Kempe returned to the subject again in an article entitled &#145;An account of some recent discoveries at Holwood Hill, in Kent&#146;, printed in the <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> of the Society of Antiquaries of 1829, to which he had contributed since 1816. He became a fellow of the society in 1828, and from among its members, with Crofton Croker, formed the select Society of Noviomagus, which took its name from the Roman city supposed to have been sited at Holwood Hill.<br>
<br>Kempe helped his sister in the posthumous production of C. A. Stothard's <span class="italic">Monumental Effigies of Great Britain</span> by writing the introduction and descriptions for this beautifully illustrated work, which came out in parts between 1823 and 1832. Apart from this, and a translation in 1820 of a two-volume work by Baron von Odeleben which had appeared in French in 1817 (although originally written in German), published as <span class="italic">Circumstantial Narrative of the Campaign in Saxony in the Year 1813</span>, his published work consists of short miscellaneous papers, some of them reprints of his articles for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Kempe died at Stamford Villas, Fulham Road, London, on 21 August 1846 and was buried in Fulham churchyard on 27 August.<br>
