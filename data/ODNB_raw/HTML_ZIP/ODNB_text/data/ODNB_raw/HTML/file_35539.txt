<span class="headword">Platts,  John Thompson</span>  (1830&#150;1904), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born on 1 August 1830 at Calcutta, India, the second son of Robert Platts of Calcutta. His father's death left Platts's mother with a large family in straitened circumstances. Platts was educated at Bedford School but returned to India in early manhood. At Lahore in 1856 he married Alice Jane Kenyon; they had three sons and four daughters. During 1858&#150;9 he was a teacher of mathematics at Benares College. He was in charge of Saugor School in the Central Provinces from 1859 to 1861, when he became mathematical professor and headmaster of Benares College. In 1864 Platts was transferred to the post of assistant inspector of schools, second circle, North-Western Provinces, and in 1868 he became officiating inspector of schools, northern circle, Central Provinces. He retired on 17 March 1872, owing to ill health.<br>
<br>Platts then returned to England. His first wife died in 1874 and on 4 October 1876 he married Mary Elizabeth, only daughter of Thomas Dunn, architect and surveyor, of Melbourne, Australia, and widow of John Hayes, architect and surveyor, of Croydon; they had one son. Platts settled at Ealing where he occupied himself with teaching Hindustani and Persian. He had closely studied both languages and had thoroughly mastered their grammars and vocabulary. On 2 June 1880 he was elected teacher of Persian in the University of Oxford. He matriculated from Balliol College on 1 February 1881, and on 21 June of that year was made MA <i>honoris causa</i>. On 19 March 1901 the degree of MA was conferred upon him by decree.<br>
<br>Platts wrote books on the grammar of Hindustani and Persian, as well as compiling dictionaries of Indian languages. He also translated from Persian and Hindustani. Thirty years after their publication, his grammar books were still thought superior to any previously published on the subject. He died suddenly at Garlants Hotel, Suffolk Street, London, on 21 September 1904, and was buried on 26 September at Wolvercote cemetery near Oxford. He was survived by his wife who was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;75 in 1905.<br>
