<span class="headword">Ogilvy,  James</span>, second earl of Airlie  (1611&#150;1704), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was born about Christmas 1611 at Airlie Castle, Forfarshire. He was the eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20596/', "James Ogilvy, master of Ogilvy, later seventh Lord Ogilvy of Airlie and first earl of Airlie (1586&#150;1666)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Isabella (1596&#150;1682), second daughter of Thomas Hamilton, first earl of Haddington. He was tutored by William Robertson, at home from an early age and then from 1626 to 1630 at the University of St Andrews, where (Robertson assured the young nobleman's father) young Ogilvy took delight in the study of geometry. At St Andrews, Ogilvy associated with his friend and cousin, James Graham, earl of Montrose. Ogilvy courted Magdalene, the youngest daughter of David, Lord Carnegie. According to tradition, as Ogilvy was on his way to propose to her he was thrown from his horse while fording a river. Regarding the ducking as an unfavourable omen, he proceeded no further. The core of truth to the story is Magdalene's rejection of Ogilvy and her later marriage to Montrose. Ogilvy shortly afterwards, and while still at St Andrews, married Helen (<i>d</i>. 1664), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20593/', "Sir George Ogilvy, later first Lord Banff")</script>: the marriage contract was dated 20&#150;25 March 1629. Together they had at least seven children, two sons and five daughters. Following the coronation of Charles I in Edinburgh in 1633 Ogilvy travelled abroad for two years. In France he attended the school of &#145;Monsieur Anglo at Paris&#146; where he learned swordsmanship, dancing, and riding; in Italy he met Montrose again.<br>
<br>Ogilvy was no friend to hardline presbyterianism, and indeed there is evidence of his Catholicism, though later he was clearly a member of the Church of Scotland, albeit of strongly episcopalian sympathies. He was an ardent royalist in the bishops' wars (1638&#150;40) along with his father, who was created earl of Airlie by Charles I for his services in 1639 (henceforward Ogilvy was known as Lord Ogilvy until he succeeded to the earldom). In the autumn of 1639 Ogilvy defended Airlie Castle against Montrose, who had been ordered to take and raze it. Instead, after a token struggle, and as part of Montrose's increasing distancing of himself from the covenanter cause, the castle was surrendered and a small garrison put in, while Ogilvy was permitted to escape. Montrose was sharply challenged by Argyll for this. The July following, Argyll's punitive campaign of fire and sword against the highland royalists brought him to the castle. Taking revenge on Montrose and Ogilvy, Argyll seized Airlie Castle, evicting Ogilvy's heavily pregnant wife and her children, and burnt the place down. Later balladry recorded that he did not &#145;leave a stan'in' stane in Airly&#146;  (Wilson, 1.215). Ogilvy, who had left the castle upon Argyll's approach to warn his mother and raise more troops, was to remind Charles II that:<blockquote>The House off Airlie was caste downe and the House of Forthar burned in the year of God 1640, having refused to covenant and joyn in armes with them. Also att tyme my wyff being big with chyld was necessitatt to flie from hir house, and having only two chyldren thay were carried awa prisoners and kepit in Dundee, the eldest of thame nott being much above thrie or foure yeirs off age. (Wilson, 2.21)</blockquote>With a warrant out for his arrest, Ogilvy fled to England. In October 1641, after returning to Scotland with Montrose, Ogilvy was involved in the &#145;incident&#146;, the conspiracy which had been approved by the king to arrest, and possibly assassinate, Argyll and the marquess of Hamilton. Ogilvy continued a close companion of Montrose, acting as his aide-de-camp. In February 1643 he accompanied Montrose to Charles I's court at Oxford to concert measures for waging war against the covenanters and then accompanied him to north-east Scotland where he sought to co-ordinate support for a rising. Refusing to obey the order of the Scottish parliament to appear before them and give security for keeping the peace, he was declared a rebel and specially exempted from pardon in August 1643. In April 1644 Ogilvy rode with Montrose in his brief invasion of south-west Scotland, and following its failure crossed the border again in disguise to scout out royalist prospects. However, when Montrose went north to begin his string of victories Ogilvy was not with his kinsman: carrying dispatches from Montrose to the king at Oxford, he had been captured by parliamentarian troops near Preston in Lancashire in August. He was handed over to the Scots and taken prisoner to Edinburgh, where he remained a prisoner in the Tolbooth for more than a year. He underwent frequent examination because he refused to accept the authority of the high court of justice to try him and demanded to be tried by his peers and to be tried as a prisoner of war rather than a rebel. He was frequently visited by his mother, sister, and wife, who in August 1645 petitioned for his removal from the then plague-infested town, and obtained an order for his removal to the Bass Rock.<br>
<br>Before this change of prisons could be effected, however, Montrose inflicted a severe defeat on the covenanters at Kilsyth (15 August 1645), which placed most of Scotland at his disposal, and sent orders to Edinburgh for the release of Lord Ogilvy and other prisoners, which were at once obeyed. Rejoining Montrose, Ogilvy resumed active service, and was present at the battle of Philiphaugh (13 September 1645). There he was captured again when the royalist army was routed. On 16 January 1646 he stood trial for treason at St Andrews and was condemned to death. The day appointed for his decapitation was 20 January. On the evening before, however, his elder sister changed clothes with him in his prison in the castle of St Andrews, and he escaped; &pound;1000 sterling was offered for his capture dead or alive, but the reward was ineffectual. In the following July, as part of the peace terms negotiated with Montrose's followers, Ogilvy secured a pardon from General John Middleton, which the Scottish parliament was obliged to confirm. He also gave satisfaction to the kirk, and was released from excommunication.<br>
<br>In May 1649 Ogilvy took part in the royalist rising in the north of Sir Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscarden. He was excommunicated again in July. In 1650 he was involved in planning another rising, though he laid down his arms in October when instructed to by Charles II following the failure of his attempted coup against his new covenanter allies. Instead in December he was appointed colonel of a cavalry regiment, a position he was able to take up once he had submitted to the kirk on 9 February 1651. After the defeat of the Scottish forces by George Monck's English army in Scotland, Ogilvy was captured, along with the members of the committees of estates, near Alyth in Forfarshire, on 28 August 1651. He was sent a prisoner from Dundee to Tynemouth Castle, and on to the Tower of London. A year later he was released on condition that he would not leave London without permission; but on a general order he was soon recommitted to the Tower. He remained a prisoner until January 1657, with the exception of three months' leave granted in July 1655 for the purpose of visiting Scotland. In a petition to Cromwell in 1656 he stated that he was seized by a party of horse under General Monck while peaceably residing at his mansion-house in Scotland and protested that he had never taken an active part against the Commonwealth. He was released in 1657 on finding security in &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Ogilvy's attempts to redeem his losses by grants from the king met with little success: a pension of &pound;500 a year was only erratically paid. He succeeded as second earl of Airlie on the death of his father in February 1666. He is frequently mentioned in the parliamentary proceedings of the reigns of Charles II and James VII. He also served actively in defence of the Restoration episcopalian settlement. In the spring of 1665 he commanded a troop of horse under the commander-in-chief in Scotland, Thomas Dalyell, taking part in November in the defeat of the covenanter rising at Rullion Green. In 1667 he was in command of a force stationed at Perth to keep watch against Dutch incursions and to keep in check the presbyterians of Fife.<br>
<br>Airlie's first wife, Helen Ogilvy, died in early July 1664. His second marriage was to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1707), daughter of Sir John Grant of Freuchie and widow of Lewis Gordon, third marquess of Huntly. Their courtship was prolonged initially by the opposition of his mother and Mary's son and then by the difficulties in obtaining the sanction of the Church of Scotland for Airlie to marry a woman who, as a convert to Catholicism, stood excommunicate. Their marriage contract was dated 31 October 1668 but it was only in June 1669 that the banns were publicly read and the marriage performed privately. In 1678 Dalyell was appointed commander of one of three cavalry troops raised for the renewed repression of the covenanters. Airlie spent the following years in these policing duties, stationed at different times in Renfrewshire, Ayr, and Galloway. In June 1679 his troop was in Glasgow to repel the attack of the covenanters fresh from their victory at Drumclog. By 1680 Dalyell was complaining of the absenteeism of his lieutenant (and of half Airlie's troop) and Airlie was superseded in command. The elderly earl successfully protested against this, but refused to serve again under Dalyell. Under James VII, with John Graham of Claverhouse as commander-in-chief in Scotland, Airlie was again offered a command, patrolling the Ayrshire coast with a regiment of dragoons. He was active in the retribution which followed Argyll's abortive rising in 1685, laying claim to the forfeited estate of George Melville, earl of Melville.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1687 Airlie's loyalty to the crown was being severely tested by the policies of the Catholic James and, forced to choose between his monarch and his episcopal kirk, Airlie resigned his commission. At the revolution of 1688 he declared for William and Mary and in March 1689 he signed the act declaring the legality of the meeting of the estates of parliament. Thereafter his great age, and perhaps his disillusion when a presbyterian church settlement was rapidly imposed, made him withdraw. He was fined &pound;1200 Scots for not attending the meeting of parliament in 1693. In 1698 and 1700 his attendance was excused on account of his age and infirmities and his fines remitted. He died, aged ninety-two, at his lodgings in Banff on 16 February 1704. He was survived by his second wife and was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, David (<i>d</i>. 1717).<br>
