<span class="headword">Campbell,  Robert</span>  (1769&#150;1846), <span class="occ">colonial merchant</span>, was born on 28 April 1769 at Cathcart Square, Greenock, Renfrewshire, fourth surviving child of ten born to John Campbell (1727&#150;1797), laird of Ashfield, writer, and town clerk, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paterson (1729&#150;1792). The three Campbell sons were &#145;bred merchant&#146;, and largely financed by their father. Robert was educated well, probably at the local borough school or with private tuition, before apparently joining his brother William in trading. In 1797 Robert followed his eldest brother, John, to Calcutta, where he was admitted to partnership in Campbell, Clarke &amp; Co., later Campbell &amp; Co. In April 1798 he was dispatched to New South Wales with a speculative cargo, to investigate the fate of a previous venture wrecked on the Australian coast.<br>
<br>Recognizing the opportunity to open a regular trade with Botany Bay, Campbell acquired land at Sydney Cove for a warehouse and wharf, and returned with another cargo in February 1800. On 17 September 1801 he married Sophia (Sophy) Palmer (1777&#150;1833), the artistically talented sister of the commissary, John Palmer. As Sydney's first resident merchant, Campbell negotiated government contracts for supplies from India, including cargoes of desperately needed cattle. By 1804 goods worth &pound;50,000 lay in his store, and his restrained prices and generous credit caused grateful settlers to acknowledge this means of escape from the former &#145;mercenary unsparing Hand of Avarice and Extortion&#146;  (Steven, 60). To create a trade staple, Campbell financed local sealing and whaling, and to free this successful industry from mercantilist regulations he took a cargo of colonial produce to London in 1805. As the shipment contravened East India Company monopoly rights his ship was formally seized, but, with the intervention of Sir Joseph Banks and William Wilberforce, commercial loss was avoided and permission secured for the entry of a second cargo. Concurrently the Grenville ministry prepared a bill intended to free the trade of New South Wales but this significant policy did not survive its loss of office in 1807.<br>
<br>Campbell returned to Sydney in August 1806, some days after Governor Bligh, who welcomed him as &#145;just and humane and a gentleman like merchant&#146;  (Steven, 153). Already aware of dormant opposition, Bligh drew Campbell into his administration, appointing him magistrate and naval officer, then virtually colonial treasurer. As naval officer Campbell had the responsibility for confiscating the spirit stills from John Macarthur's ship, precipitating open resistance to the governor. Active and courageous during the insurrection, Campbell was arrested and dismissed from his posts by the rebels, and later tried by a rebel court&#151;whose authority he persisted in rejecting&#151;for refusing appointment as coroner. He remained a pillar of support for Bligh's persecuted allies, but his trading was destructively supervised in reprisal. Campbell was one of the first to be officially reinstated by Governor Macquarie but was compelled to sail for London as a witness for Bligh before he could order his affairs. He gave evidence at Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston's court martial in 1811 and the following April appeared before the select committee on transportation. In 1811 his London agent failed spectacularly, reputedly &pound;30,000 in Campbell's debt. Though contriving to postpone collapse, he returned to Sydney in 1815 in all but utter ruin.<br>
<br>Campbell &amp; Co. was liquidated. With house, premises, and lands mortgaged, the family lived frugally on rents until outstanding debts were honoured. By 1820, free of all connection with India, Campbell had opened a modest agency, and in 1827 admitted his sons John and <a href="#cosubject_52440">Robert [<i>see below</i>]</a> to partnership. Survival was aided by landholding. Campbell had purchased a large estate, Ashfield, in 1803 to accommodate rejected contract cattle. In 1806 one of his ships was wrecked in government service. In 1825 he was finally compensated by a grant of 5000 acres (Duntroon) to which he added many thousand acres by purchase. By the 1840s he owned the choicest selections on the Limestone plains&#151;later the site of Canberra&#151;while his stock also grazed on vast squatting runs.<br>
<br>Raised a Presbyterian, Campbell latterly gravitated towards the Church of England. He was a consistent benefactor, endowing churches and schools, was the agent for the London Missionary Society, and managed a savings bank for &#145;the industrious poor&#146;, popularly known as Campbell's bank. At the founding of the first Sydney chamber of commerce (1826) his name, as &#145;father of the mercantile community&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sydney Gazette</span>, 8 July 1826), was placed ahead of all other members. Survived by six of his seven children, Campbell died on 15 April 1846 at Duntroon, and was buried on 27 April in the family vault of St John's Anglican Church cemetery, Parramatta.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52440"></a><span class="headword">Robert Campbell</span>  (1804&#150;1859), Campbell's second son, was born at Wharf House, Campbell's Wharf, Sydney, and educated in England (1810&#150;19). On his return he joined his father's agency. He became a leader of the campaign to end convict transportation, first in the 1830s and again in 1846 when the threat of revival involved him in a celebrated public meeting and petition of dissent. In mid-1849 he chaired two further meetings, and was subsequently a delegate to the &#145;anti-felon&#146; Australasian League. He was a liberal and democratic member of the legislative council (1851&#150;6) and legislative assembly (1856&#150;9), and was colonial treasurer in 1856, and again from 1858. He died at Duntroon, and was buried in the family vault at Parramatta.<br>
<br>The elder Robert Campbell's nephew, <a name="cosubject_52441"></a><span class="headword">Robert Campbell junior</span>  (1789&#150;1851), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born at Greenock, Renfrewshire, the son of William Campbell, town clerk, and his wife, Jean Morrison. He accompanied his uncle to Sydney in 1806 to become a clerk in Campbell &amp; Co., but raised personal capital by discreet dealing. In 1813 he went into business independently and, acquiring a partner in 1835, traded also as Campbell &amp; Co. During the economic collapse of the 1840s his company was administered by trustees, but the partnership recovered strongly, handling wool and gold. Dashing, convivial, and romantic, as well as shrewd, he was prominent in Sydney life. A director (1830&#150;51) and president (1843&#150;51) of the Bank of New South Wales, he was a pioneer of the Sydney turf, at one time owning a Persian stallion, Hector, the foundation sire of Australian bloodstock. Campbell died at Sydney, and was buried in Waverley cemetery.<br>
