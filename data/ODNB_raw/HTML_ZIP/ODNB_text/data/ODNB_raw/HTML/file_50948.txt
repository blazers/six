<span class="headword">Clapham,  John</span>  (1908&#150;1992), <span class="occ">musicologist</span>, was born on 31 July 1908 at Studland, Baldock Road, Letchworth, Hertfordshire, the only son and the second of the three children of John Clapham (1870&#150;1947), stockbroker, and his wife, Edith Maud Taylor (1875&#150;1956). After school at Bedales, Clapham began his musical studies as a cello pupil of Douglas Cameron at the Royal Academy of Music in London in 1927, at the same time studying harmony and counterpoint with Stewart Macpherson. In 1931 he became an external student of London University, where he graduated in 1934, while continuing his cello studies, to which he added double bass lessons under Eugene Cruft. During the pre-war years musicological research increasingly interested Clapham.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1939 Clapham married Katharine Irene Benham (1911&#150;1962), a fellow cello student at the Royal Academy of Music, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. In the same year he joined the BBC as a sound engineer, but in 1941 he was dismissed because he was a conscientious objector, even though his case had been raised in the House of Commons by Winston Churchill and the BBC had been told to reinstate him. He spent the rest of the war years first in the fire service and then as a teacher at Wycliffe School, Bristol, which was evacuated to Lampeter in 1943. In 1946 he was appointed as a lecturer in music at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and as cellist of the university's chamber ensemble. It was here that his interest in Dvo&#345;&aacute;k became firmly established and that he first met a great-grandson of the Czech composer, the violinist Josef Suk. He became familiar with Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's chamber works first through performance and then through analytical study. He examined in detail the supposed connection between American Indian music and the composer's &#145;American&#146; works, and largely disproved popular belief that there was a direct link, before turning his attention to a study of the orchestral music. Of his many students, he considered the Welsh composer William Mathias to be among the most brilliant. In 1946 Clapham gained his DMus as an external student of London University, and in 1959 he was made a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music. His many visits to Prague began in 1956 and continued until 1988.<br>
<br>In 1962 John Clapham was appointed senior lecturer in the music faculty of Edinburgh University, and he was reader there from 1969 until his retirement in 1973, when he returned to live in Bristol. Soon after his arrival in Edinburgh his wife died, and he took comfort in his family and in the company of his Edinburgh colleague and friend, the composer Hans G&aacute;l, with whom he shared a quiet, droll sense of humour. On 30 December 1966 he married Mary Cousins (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright) (1915&#150;1997), herself a violinist and schoolmistress and the former wife of Farquharson Cousins, principal hornist of the Scottish National Orchestra. In the same year Clapham's first major study on Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, <span class="italic">Anton&iacute;n Dvo&#345;&aacute;k: Musician and Craftsman</span>, was published. His widening interest in Czech music led to a fine study of Bed&#345;ich Smetana for the series <span class="roman">Master Musicians</span> (1972). He turned his attention to other Czech composers, including Jan&aacute;&#269;ek and Martin&#367;, and was among the first to draw attention to the relationship between Jan&aacute;&#269;ek's speech-rhythm melodic patterns and Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's late symphonic poems. He thus established himself internationally as the leading authority outside Czechoslovakia on Czech music.<br>
<br>In 1974 Clapham was, with Josef Suk, the founder patron of the Dvo&#345;&aacute;k Society for Czech and Slovak Music in Great Britain, having previously been a founder member of the Dvo&#345;&aacute;k Society in Prague. In 1979 another book, simply entitled <span class="italic">Dvo&#345;&aacute;k</span>, was published. From this time and almost until his death he continued his research and writing on Czech music, publishing many valuable papers on a wide range of related topics in academic journals such as <span class="italic">Music &amp; Letters</span>, the <span class="italic">Musical Quarterly</span>, the <span class="italic">Music Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Czech Music</span>. A third Dvo&#345;&aacute;k study, <span class="italic">Anton&iacute;n Dvo&#345;&aacute;k: Man and Artist</span>, remained unpublished. Among his closest Czech friends he counted Jarmil Burghauser, that country's leading Dvo&#345;&aacute;k scholar and the author of the standard thematic catalogue of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's works, first published in 1960. Over the years, John Clapham selflessly helped Burghauser in the mammoth task of producing a revised second edition, which was eventually published in 1997. In recognition, the author included Clapham's name on the title-page. As early as 1960 he had been proposed for an honorary doctorate of Charles University, Prague, but the political situation prevented this. After the &#145;Velvet revolution&#146; in 1989, Burghauser and his Czech friends again raised the matter, but at the time of his death the necessary academic formalities had not been completed.<br>
<br>John Clapham was a very private person but very warm towards all who shared his enthusiasm for the Czechs and their music. To fellow scholars, young and old, he was always most generous and ever helpful; to the end, however, he would never let an error of detail pass, even a slip of the tongue in conversation, without polite but firm correction. Students who could match his standards found in him a fine teacher, while others found his scholastic demands inhibiting. His last years were spent close to the home of his younger son, at Stanton Court Nursing Home, Stanton Drew, Bristol, where he died on 9 November 1992. He was cremated on 17 November at Haycombe, Bath, and his ashes were buried that day at St Andrew's Church, Chew Magna. He and his second wife had separated. The name of Clapham has remained alive in Czech music scholarship after his death in the constant reference to his books and papers at musicological conferences and in published studies, not only by those who knew him but also by a new generation of researchers sharing his lifelong interests.<br>
