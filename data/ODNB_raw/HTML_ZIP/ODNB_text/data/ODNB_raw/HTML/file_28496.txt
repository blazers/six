<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1674, <em>d.</em> 1747), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and historian</span>, son of Endymion Walker, was baptized at St Kerrian's, Exeter, on 21 January 1674. His father was mayor of Exeter from 1682 to 1683. On 19 November 1691 he matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, was admitted fellow on 3 July 1695, and became full fellow on 4 July 1696 (vacated 1700). On 16 January 1698 he was ordained deacon by Sir Jonathan Trelawny, then bishop of Exeter; he graduated BA on 4 July 1698 and was instituted to the rectory of St Mary Major, Exeter, on 22 August after the death of the previous incumbent, Richard Carpenter. On 13 October 1699 he graduated MA (apparently incorporated at Cambridge, 1702).<br>
<br>The publication of Edmund Calamy's <span class="italic">Account</span> (1702&#150;13) of nonconformist ministers silenced and ejected after the Restoration in 1660 suggested simultaneously to Charles Goodall and to Walker the idea of rendering a similar service to the memory of the conforming clergy who were deprived and sequestered by the puritans in the period before the Restoration. Goodall advertised for information in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>; finding that Walker was engaged on a similar task, he gave him the materials he had collected. Walker collected particulars by help of query sheets, circulated in various dioceses. (Those for Exeter&#151;very minute&#151;and Canterbury are printed by Calamy in his <span class="italic">Church and Dissenters Compar'd as to Persecution</span>, 1719.) Walker's helpers in this task included Mary Astell. His diligence in amassing materials may be estimated from the detailed account given in the preface to his <span class="italic">Attempt towards recovering an account of the numbers and sufferings of the clergy of the Church of England, heads of colleges, fellows, scholars, &amp;c., who were sequester'd, harrass'd, &amp;c. in the late times of the grand rebellion</span> (1714). A remarkable subscription list contains over thirteen hundred names. The work consists of two parts: first, a history of ecclesiastical affairs from 1640 to 1660, the object being to show that the ejection of the puritans by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> (1662) was a just reprisal for their actions when in power; second, a catalogue, well arranged and fairly well indexed, of the deprived clergy with particulars of their sufferings. The plan falls short of Calamy's, as it does not give biographies. A third part, announced in the title-page as an examination of Calamy's work, was deferred and never appeared, though Calamy is plentifully attacked in the preface.<br>
<br>The work was hailed by Thomas Bisse in a sermon before the sons of the clergy (6 December 1716) as a &#145;book of martyrology&#146; and &#145;a record which ought to be kept in every sanctuary&#146;. However, John Lewis, whom Calamy calls a &#145;chumm&#146; of Walker's, and who had formed high expectations of the book, disparages it, in <span class="italic">Remarks</span> on Bisse, as &#145;a farrago of false and senseless legends&#146;. It was criticized, from the nonconformist side, by John Withers of Exeter, in an appendix to his <span class="italic">Reply</span> (1714) to two pamphlets by John Agate, an Exeter clergyman; and by Calamy in <span class="italic">The Church and the Dissenters Compar'd</span>. Walker's work, though strongly polemical and full of anti-puritan sentiments, shows evidence of careful historical consideration of his materials, and he does not try to ignore the charges made against some of his &#145;sufferers&#146; which led to their ejection.<br>
<br>Walker married Martha Brooking (1679/80&#150;1747), in Exeter Cathedral on 17 November 1704. On 7 December 1714 he was made DD by diploma at Oxford in recognition of his literary work on the sufferings of the clergy. On 20 December of the same year he became a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral. On 17 October 1720 he was instituted to the rectory of Upton Pyne in Devon, after the death of the previous rector, James Gray. He was presented to the living by Hugh Stafford of Pyne. He seems to have spent the rest of his life there.<br>
<br>Walker died in 1747, probably at Upton Pyne. He was buried on the north side of the chancel at Upton Pyne church on 20 June 1747. Before his death Walker had expressed an intention to deposit the material he had collected for his work in a library. In 1754 his son William, a druggist in Exeter, presented these papers to the Bodleian Library, where they remain. They were bound up in the nineteenth century, making twelve folio and eleven quarto volumes. Walker also left a large collection of pamphlets, and several letters, which have proved awkward to decipher because of his eccentric handwriting. He was survived by his wife who, according to her tombstone, was buried on 12 September 1747, aged sixty-seven.<br>
