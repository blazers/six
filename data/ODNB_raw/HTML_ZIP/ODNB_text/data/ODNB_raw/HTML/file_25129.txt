<span class="headword">Settle,  Thomas</span>  (1555&#150;1622), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and separatist</span>, was born to unknown parents. Nothing is known of his early life before he matriculated as a pensioner from Queens' College, Cambridge, at Michaelmas 1575. He left Cambridge about 1579 without a degree. On 1 March 1580 Edmund Freake, bishop of Norwich, ordained him to the ministry and instituted him rector of Westfield, Norfolk. He resigned Westfield on 7 October 1585. Even before that time, he seems to have been serving as curate to Robert Waller, vicar of Mildenhall, Suffolk. Mildenhall soon felt the force of Settle's godly zeal. To supplement his preaching and teaching he prepared <span class="italic">A Catechisme</span> [1587] for the inhabitants, and annexed to it &#145;A fardle of Christian duties&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1584, however, Settle demonstrated his discontent with Archbishop Whitgift's religious policy. He signed a petition refusing subscription to the three articles, Whitgift's shibboleth of conformity, and began holding night-time conventicles in Mildenhall. Such activities did not go unnoticed. According to depositions taken on 22 April 1585 Waller and others accused Settle of not following the prayer book, and Settle stated that he disliked &#145;the order of the government of the church&#146;. Furthermore, he characterized Archbishop Whitgift as &#145;a very enemy to the church and a Tirant and worse than ever [Bishop] Bonner was&#146;  (Lambeth Palace Library, carte antique et miscellanee XII, item 19, fols. 2<i>r</i> and 3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>During part of 1585 and early 1586 Settle evidently preached at Boxted, Suffolk. Then, in May 1586, he was summoned before Archbishop Whitgift. According to Settle's account, this interview was a stormy one. The archbishop accused him of several irregularities, such as failing to use the ring in marriage and the sign of the cross in baptism. Settle replied that he taught nothing but what was in the word of God and the best theologians. He also refused to sign the three articles. Enraged, Whitgift ordered that he be imprisoned in the Gatehouse.<br>
<br>Settle next attracted the attention of George Carleton, a prominent Northamptonshire MP and puritan activist. After his release from gaol Settle went to Northamptonshire. There he became deeply involved in the presbyterian classis movement, and served as a delegate to its general conference in London during February 1589. His Northamptonshire sojourn ended in April 1589, when the privy council summoned both him and Carleton to appear as part of its Martin Marprelate investigation. By January 1590 Settle was once again confined in the Gatehouse.<br>
<br>The collapse of the classis movement led Settle to espouse more radical opinions. By April 1590 he had stopped taking communion with the established church, and by April 1592 he had become a full-fledged separatist. Later, in September, he became a charter member of the newly organized London separatist congregation which had Francis Johnson as its pastor, and helped officiate at several of the congregation's illegal services. He was again arrested, imprisoned, and examined by the authorities in late 1592 and early 1593. A transcript of his 6 April 1593 interrogation shows him still defiant.<br>
<br>However, quarrels among the separatists soon undermined Settle's zeal. Chief among these was the contention that broke out in early 1594 between Francis Johnson and his brother George over Francis's wife's dress and deportment. Settle at first opposed Francis, but later, because of Francis's subtle reasoning, he became confused and despondent. Eventually Settle agreed to conform. He was released from prison and travelled to Norfolk, where on 10 March 1596 he was licensed to preach and administer the sacraments at Barningham Winter and Matlaske. He was instituted to the livings of Barningham Winter and Matlaske on 2 May and 20 May 1601 respectively. A record of Settle's subscription to the three articles, dated 1 October 1600, survives at Lambeth Palace.<br>
<br>Settle relinquished Barningham Winter on 3 November 1614, but retained Matlaske. He was buried there on 13 December 1622. References to a &#145;Mrs. Settle&#146; from the early 1590s suggest that he was married, but conclusive evidence is lacking.<br>
