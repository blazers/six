<span class="headword">Gordon,  Alexander</span>  (1752&#150;1799), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 20 May 1752 in the parish of Peterculter in Aberdeenshire. He, and his twin brother James, who became a successful farmer in Logie in Aberdeenshire, were the second and third of the five children of Alexander Gordon, tenant farmer of Miltown of Drum. After a general education Gordon attended Marischal College in Aberdeen, graduating MA in 1775. He then studied medicine in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and probably Leiden.<br>
<br>In 1780 Gordon entered the Royal Navy as surgeon's mate, becoming full surgeon in 1782. On 5 February 1784 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Harvie, who survived until 1843; they had two daughters. Gordon left the navy on half-pay in 1785 to spend nine months in London developing his special interest in midwifery. He was resident pupil at the lying-in hospital in Store Street, received clinical instruction from two of the leading obstetricians of the day, Thomas Denman and William Osborne, and attended the Middlesex Lying-in Dispensary. When he returned to Aberdeen towards the end of 1785 he was appointed physician to the Aberdeen Dispensary. In 1786 he published his <span class="italic">Observations of the Efficacy of Cold-Bathing in the Prevention and Cure of Diseases</span>, a treatise of no great originality on a fashionable subject. Two years later he was awarded the degree of MD by Marischal College.<br>
<br>Were it not for a severe epidemic of puerperal fever (&#145;childbed fever&#146;) in Aberdeen, which lasted from December 1789 to March 1792, Gordon might well have been forgotten. Puerperal fever was previously unknown in Aberdeen and the epidemic was thought to be no more than the common ephemeral fever known as the &#145;weed&#146;, which was rarely fatal. Gordon, however, had seen many cases of puerperal fever in London. Recognizing that the epidemic was due to this deadly disease, he kept careful notes of every case. From these he was able to make the crucial observation that the disease tended to be confined to the practice of a small minority of midwives. Indeed, he was able to forecast accurately which women would develop the disease merely by knowing which midwife had been in attendance. He also realized that he had himself unwittingly carried the disease from one midwifery patient to another.<br>
<br>Gordon was the first to provide irrefutable evidence of what had been until then no more than a faint suspicion: that puerperal fever was a contagious disease that could be carried from patient to patient by doctors and midwives. He also showed that it was closely connected with erysipelas. These observations were made some fifty years before the well-known work of Oliver Wendell Holmes and Ignaz Semmelweis, which overshadowed Gordon's early but brilliant contribution to the understanding of puerperal fever. After more than a century of relative obscurity Gordon's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Epidemic Puerperal Fever of Aberdeen</span> (1795) was recognized for what it is, a masterpiece of early epidemiology based on astute clinical observation and written with exceptional clarity.<br>
<br>Sadly, Gordon's treatise damaged his professional reputation. As dispensary physician almost the whole burden of the epidemic fell on his shoulders and the women of Aberdeen turned against him, holding him responsible for the facts he revealed, and disputing his fervent belief in the efficacy of purging and heavy bleeding which were &#145;repugnant to popular opinion&#146;. Hurt by &#145;the ungenerous treatment which I met with from that very sex whose sufferings I was at so much pains to relieve&#146;, he was glad to leave Aberdeen when recalled to active duty in the Royal Navy. Soon, however, he developed pulmonary tuberculosis and was invalided out. An ill man, he returned to his brother James's farm, where he died at the early age of forty-seven on 19 October 1799.<br>
