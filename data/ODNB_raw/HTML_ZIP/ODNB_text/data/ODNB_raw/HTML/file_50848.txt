<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bratby,  John Randall</span>  (1928&#150;1992), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 19 July 1928 at a nursing home in Wimbledon, the first of two children of George Alfred Bratby (1887&#150;1947), wine taster, and his wife, Lily Beryl Randall (1897&#150;1945). The Bratbys traced their roots to Derbyshire, while the Randalls were a London family. Instability marked the Bratbys, with Bratby's grandfather dying in an insane asylum, and an uncle confined for life in a mental institution. George Bratby was to manifest symptoms of mental illness, and the shadow of this darkened Bratby's own life, and made him at times fearful for his sanity. It was not a happy childhood. From an early age, Bratby was aware of his father's frightening paranoid energy: a man quite capable of believing there were hidden microphones in his chimney, or that the radio could listen to you just as you could hear it. There were constant rows between his parents, and there was little warmth or affection in the home. Later, the increasingly deranged and now unemployed George Bratby embarrassed his son by wandering the suburban streets of Norbiton in sandals and casual clothes while everyone else was going to work.<br>
<br>At school, Bratby was shy, unpopular, and bullied. He did not distinguish himself at lessons. Coupled with his miserable home life, this led him to create an alternative world: he resold school buns at breaktime, wrote pornographic stories, for the reading of which he charged, and trained himself as a boxer. Not until he was seventeen did he begin to show any real aptitude for art, and then it was due to the inspired teaching of Harold Watts, who recognized the potential in Bratby's sketches of boxers. Conscripted, Bratby was swiftly discharged on account of his extreme myopia, but managed to obtain an ex-service grant, with which, at Watts's encouragement, he went on to study at Kingston School of Art (1947&#150;50). There he discovered the extraordinary determination to succeed which took him on to the Royal College of Art (RCA; 1951&#150;4), and his early fame.<br>
<br>Bratby believed that he had inherited his father's energy, and that it was this which gave him the drive to paint. The artistic impulse he attributed to his mother's family. Painfully shy and often aggressive because of it, he was unsuited to art school camaraderie, and found academic training uncongenial. At Kingston he failed the intermediate exam in arts and crafts, and was forced to leave. But by this point, painting was his life-raft, and he continued to paint and draw obsessively. He managed to produce a body of work, awkward but not without talent, which convinced the professor of the Slade School of Fine Art to offer him a postgraduate place. Bratby, with what was to become typical cheek and canniness, managed to swap his Slade place for one at the Royal College, which he considered a superior institution. It was while a student at the RCA that the Bratby myth began to coalesce. According to his own later slightly embarrassed account he frequented prostitutes and was tempted into physical violence. He lived wildly, splurging his grant and then having to stow away in the attics of the college (from which he and his paintings were once summarily ejected), or begging and sleeping rough in Hyde Park. His work matched his lifestyle. Influenced by the down-to-earth realism of Sickert, Bratby depicted the seedier aspects of his surroundings, and would be found in the college studios painting a dustbin, or setting up his easel in a lavatory. The style of his painting was correspondingly crude and vigorous&#151;he favoured thick pigment in sombre colours. The professor of painting at the college, Carel Weight, thought him the most talented student he had ever had. On 2 April 1953 he married his fellow RCA student Jean Esme Oregon Cooke (1927&#150;2008). A sculptor and potter, Cooke subsequently became a painter of real distinction.<br>
<br>In 1954 Bratby had the first of a series of one-man exhibitions at the acclaimed Beaux Arts Gallery, and his public career was launched. He began to win prizes: first in the John Moores junior section (1957), and Guggenheim awards (1956, 1958). In 1954 he first exhibited a painting at the Royal Academy, becoming an associate in 1959, and a Royal Academician in 1971. With his trademark thick paint and his flair for publicity (he had a talent for leaking stories to the press), Bratby soon became not only a folk hero in the art schools of Britain, but a household name. At first the critics' response was overwhelmingly supportive, with the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> comparing Bratby's rendition of a cornflake packet favourably with Vel&aacute;zquez's <span class="italic">Rokeby Venus</span>. In 1956 he was chosen to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale, along with the other so-called kitchen sink painters&#151;Edward Middleditch, Jack Smith, and Derrick Greaves. A major early painting, <span class="italic">Still-Life with Chip Frier</span>, was that year bought by the Tate Gallery. Other examples of his work are in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
<br>In 1957 Bratby was commissioned to paint the pictures for the film of Joyce Cary's novel <span class="italic">The Horse's Mouth</span>, starring Alec Guinness as its bohemian artist-hero. He exhibited his work in America, and bought a house in Blackheath. Then, in 1960, he was suddenly dropped by the influential critics, as abstraction and pop art seized their collective attention. Although he remained a thoroughly popular artist, selling well until the end of his life, Bratby's critical reputation slumped, to show the first signs of reassessment only in 1990. From 1960 onwards, his behaviour must be seen in the context of early success painfully followed by what he saw as consignment to art historical limbo.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with painting, and perhaps having momentarily overworked his seam, Bratby took up writing, producing a stream of luridly autobiographical illustrated novels, beginning with <span class="italic">Breakdown</span> in 1960. This was followed by <span class="italic">Breakfast and Elevenses</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Brake-Pedal Down</span> (1962), <span class="italic">Break 50 Kill</span> (1963), and a host of unpublished sequels and short stories. Bratby was driven to be prolific: in his writing he was as compulsive and compelling as in his painting. A portrait series begun in 1967 eventually numbered more than 1500 pictures. Meanwhile, in 1970 Bratby suffered a crisis in his life and art, adopting a highly charged Fauvist palette and threatening his marriage with increasingly wayward behaviour. He drank heavily and pursued young ladies. There were several driving offences. Then in 1974 he met Patricia (Patti) Prime (<i>b</i>. 1931), an actress, through a lonely hearts column. In 1975 he was divorced from Jean Cooke. He married Patti on 4 May 1977, and a period of relative stability ensued.<br>
<br>As Bratby grew older, he tended to work frenetically, and then spend up to half the rest of the year travelling abroad on the proceeds. As he scrawled late in life on a Missoni carrier bag: &#145;I do not want to be right and broke, I'd rather be wrong and in funds.&#146; If the paintings sometimes suffered as a result, there was usually still some trace of the Bratby genius to transform and reinvent what he saw with urgent physicality. The intensity of his early work created a hard act even for Bratby to follow, while his popularity in the media tended to militate against his genuine achievement. He died outside his home in Hastings, the Cupola and Tower of the Winds, Belmont Road, on 20 July 1992, and was cremated at Hastings crematorium on 29 July. He was survived by his wife, Patti.<br>
