<span class="headword">Weston,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1522, <em>d.</em> 1573), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was the third son of John Weston (<i>d</i>. after 1525), of Weeford, Staffordshire, and his wife, Cecilia (<i>d</i>. after 1525), sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19953/', "Ralph Neville, fourth earl of Westmorland (1498&#150;1549)")</script>. One brother, James Weston (<i>c</i>.1525&#150;1589), was an MP. Robert Weston entered All Souls College, Oxford, where he devoted himself to the study of civil law. He was elected a fellow of the college in 1536 and attained the degrees of BCL on 17 February 1538 and DCL on 20 July 1556. From 1546 to 1549 he was principal of Broadgates Hall, acting during the same time as deputy reader in civil law under Dr John Story and holding the regius professorship in civil law for a few months in 1546. He was sole regius professor from 26 March 1550 to 29 September 1553. He had married Alice (<i>d</i>. in or after 1573), daughter of Richard Jenyns of Great Barr, Staffordshire, by 1551/2. They had one son, John Weston (1551/2&#150;1632), and three daughters, including Alice (<i>d</i>. after 1585), who married as her second husband <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9296/', "Geoffrey Fenton (c.1539&#150;1608)")</script> in June 1585.<br>
<br>Weston was vicar general of Exeter, Devon, under Miles Coverdale, bishop of Exeter, from 1551 to 1553 and was returned as MP for Exeter in March 1553 and for Lichfield, Staffordshire, in 1558, and again in 1559. On 12 January 1559 Weston was created dean of the arches and was a commissioner for administering the oaths prescribed to be taken by ecclesiastics according to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> (1559). He was consulted in regard to Elizabeth I's commission issued on 6 December confirming Matthew Parker as archbishop of Canterbury, and was included in a commission issued on 25 April 1564 and 8 November 1564 to inquire into complaints of piracy committed against the subjects of Philip II. His reputation for learning was deservedly high, and he was considered as a potential English representative at the general council which it was rumoured was to be summoned by Pius IV in 1560.<br>
<br>In April 1566, at the request of the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, Weston was nominated as lord chancellor in the place of Hugh Curwen, archbishop of Dublin. More than a year elapsed before letters patent were issued appointing him on 10 June 1567, the queen expressing her confidence in her choice as &#145;our trusty, well-beloved Doctor Weston, dean of the arches here, a man for his learning and approved integrity thoroughly qualified to receive and possess the same&#146;. To increase his income she also appointed him dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, <i>in commendam</i>, &#145;whereof the archbishop of Armagh [Adam Loftus] is now dean, and yet to leave it at our order, as we know he will&#146;. He was advanced &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for the expenses of his journey, of which half was to be a gift and the other half to be deducted from his salary  (E. P. Shirley, ed., <span class="italic">Original Letters and Papers in Illustration of the History of the Church of Ireland</span>, 299, 303).<br>
<br>Weston arrived in Dublin in early August 1567 and was sworn into office on the 8th. Shortly afterwards Sidney departed for England, and Weston and Sir William Fitzwilliam, the vice-treasurer, were sworn as lords justices in Christ Church on 14 October. Weston was reluctant to assume the onerous duties of the office, pleaded his ecclesiastical duties as a reason for leaving the hard work to his colleague, and stressed his unworthiness &#145;wanting, as he does, the courage and skill in martial affairs of Sir H. Sidney&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1509&#150;73</i>, 343, 347). Although he became dean of St Patrick's in 1567 he soon discovered that there was a great difference between his nominal and actual salary. Early in 1568 he persuaded Elizabeth to make him an additional yearly grant of &pound;100. In 1570 she conferred on him the deanery of Wells <i>in commendam</i>, which he was to hold, as with the deanery of St Patrick's, as a lay fee to increase his income. In June 1568 Weston was included in a commission to inquire into offences against the <span class="roman">Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy</span> in Ireland. His duties as lord justice prevented him from paying as much attention to the chancery as he would have wished, and in August he asked that John Ball, student of civil law at Christ Church, Oxford, be sent over to assist him. His request appears to have been complied with. Nevertheless he established an excellent reputation as chancellor, proving himself, according to John Hooker:<blockquote>a man so bent to the execution of justice, and so severe therein, that he by no means would be seduced or averted from the same, and so much good in the end ensued from his upright, diligent, and dutiful service, as that the whole realm found themselves most happy and blessed to have him serve among them. (R. Holinshed and J. Hooker, <span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland</span>, 6 vols., 1807&#150;8, 6.336)</blockquote>Perhaps Hooker was biased by the favourable judgment by Weston in the matter of the claim of Sir Peter Carew to the barony of Idrone, co. Carlow. Fitzwilliam, lord deputy, nevertheless praised his integrity, writing to William Cecil, Baron Burghley, the lord treasurer, in 1572 that Weston &#145;is godly and cannot be corrupted by gifts&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1509&#150;73</i>, 464). Weston was a moderate protestant allied with Hugh Brady, bishop of Meath, and Thomas Lancaster, archbishop of Armagh, in favour of persuasion rather than coercive measures to advance his religion. He supported local reformers in securing the act of 1570 to establish diocesan free schools and supported the establishment of a university, although the latter did not come to fruition until 1592.<br>
<br>In an age when most of his contemporaries actively sought sinecures Weston resisted these being imposed on him by others. Even before his appointment to the deanery of Wells, he expressed his doubts to Burghley as to the propriety of taking the fees of the deanery of St Patrick's and yet neglecting to serve in the post, and in 1572 wrote to him saying that &#145;even from the first I liked not very well spiritual livings for temporal service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1571&#150;5</i>, 272). As to the Irish, who had known Christianity for a thousand years, he shared the general opinion of his compatriots that they remained barbarous and basically pagan in their habits, but he preferred peaceful conversion to military suppression. He recommended the sending to Ireland of protestant ministers to save &#145;many thousands of souls &hellip; that else would perish&#146;. He believed that it &#145;would work a willing and more perfect obedience in all subjects than any fear of sword or punishment can do&#146;  (Canny, 128). Shortly after arriving in Ireland he developed gout, and both on the ground of health and of his moral scruples he pleaded to be recalled, which he continued to do throughout his life. Although he was not included again in the commission for government during the absence of the lord deputy his services were too useful to be dispensed with. Despite holding the deanery of Wells from 1570 his position was difficult, for, on 19 August 1571, Fitzwilliam informed Burghley that Weston had &#145;broken up his house through want&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1571&#150;5</i>, 104). His increasing illness and his conscientious doubts prevented him from enjoying the benefits of his ecclesiastical livings, and he begged Burghley on 17 June 1572 to obtain permission for him to resign and to return to England.<br>
<br>In March 1573 Weston petitioned the queen herself to be relieved, but it was too late. He died in Dublin on 20 May 1573. His death is touchingly described by Holinshed. With the Irish privy council, friends, and household gathered round and all having taken communion, he exhorted the Irish privy council to be &#145;virtuous in God's true religion&#146;, to be mindful of their duty to Elizabeth and &#145;the great charge of the government laid upon them&#146;, and to be &#145;valiant, careful and studious&#146; in its performance, &#145;to the glory of God, honour to the queen, and the benefit to the whole realm&#146;. Having done this &#145;he bade them farewell, and not long after, he being fervent in his prayers, he died most godlie, virtuously, and Christian like&#146;  (O'Flanagan, 1.261&#150;2). He was buried in St Patrick's beneath the altar, &#145;leaving behind him an excellent character for uprightness, judgment, learning, courtesy, and piety&#146;  (H. Cotton, <span class="italic">Fasti ecclesiae Hibernicae</span>, 5 vols., Dublin, 1845&#150;78, 2.97).<br>
<br>Weston's granddaughter Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1630), the daughter of Weston's daughter Alice Fenton, married Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork, on 25 July 1603. Cork's monument in St Patrick's is surmounted by an effigy of Robert Weston in a recumbent position and in his robes of state, under an arch which forms the upper part of the monument, with an inscription recording that he &#145;was so learned, judicious and upright in the course of judicature, as, in all the time of that employment, he never made order or decree that was questioned or reversed&#146;  (Mason, 167&#150;71, appx, liv). There is also a bronze bust by Sir Henry Cheere in All Souls College, Oxford.<br>
