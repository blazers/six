<span class="headword">Murray, Sir  George Herbert</span>  (1849&#150;1936), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 27 September 1849 at Southfleet, Kent, the elder son of George Edward Murray (1818&#150;1854), fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and rector of Southfleet, and his wife, Penelope Frances Elizabeth Pemberton Austin (<i>d</i>. 1910), youngest daughter of Brigadier-General John Austin. The great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19606/', "Lord George Murray")</script>, bishop of St David's, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19628/', "John Murray, third duke of Atholl")</script>, he was heir presumptive to the dukedom from 1865 to 1871 and second heir presumptive at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, Murray took third-class honours in the school of <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1872. He entered the Foreign Office in the following year under the system of limited competition after nomination by the secretary of state, and was transferred to the Treasury in 1880, with a post as second-class clerk in the department of the auditor of the civil list. Murray married on 23 September 1879 Helen Mary (<i>d</i>. 1932), eldest daughter of John Mulholland, later first Baron Dunleath. He was appointed secretary to successive royal commissions on the depression of trade (1886), on gold and silver (1887), and on conditions in the western highlands and islands of Scotland (1889). He was private secretary to the first lord of the Treasury throughout Gladstone's last ministry (August 1892 to March 1894), a post he retained under Lord Rosebery. In 1897 he was appointed chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, and in 1899 transferred to the Post Office as secretary. In 1903, on the retirement of Sir Francis Mowatt, he became joint permanent secretary of the Treasury, in conjunction with Sir Edward Hamilton, who handled financial matters, while Murray dealt with administration. When Hamilton retired in October 1907 Murray became sole permanent secretary, and in 1909, additionally, auditor of the civil list. He retired from the civil service on 23 July 1911.<br>
<br>Although described by Hamilton as a &#145;born administrator&#146;  (MSS Asquith, vol. 19, 25 Sept 1907), there is evidence to suggest that Murray was somewhat lacking in imagination. In 1906&#150;7 he chaired the government factories and workshops committee, which had been set up to inquire into &#145;the economy of production (of munitions) in time of peace and the power of expansion in time of war&#146;. Unfortunately Murray seems to have showed much more interest in economy than in expansion, and it has been claimed that the committee's recommendations contributed to the &#145;shell shortage&#146; of 1915  (Trebilcock, 152&#150;4). He was a civil servant of the old school, who worked best by written minutes, and who, when Lloyd George became chancellor in 1908, refused to adapt to the latter's habit of ignoring paperwork and relying on oral briefings. As a result, Lloyd George bypassed Murray and looked to Robert Chalmers, the chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, for advice on more than revenue matters, as well as to John Bradbury, the principal clerk in charge of the Treasury's finance division. Having been brought up in Gladstonian principles of public finance, Murray's personal political inclination was towards this school of Liberalism, and he was opposed to many of the ideas introduced in Lloyd George's budget of 1909, particularly the supertax and allowances for taxpayers with children.<br>
<br>Murray had a dry sense of humour: he once opposed a proposal to spend money on a subway under Whitehall for the secret disposal of army's archives in the event of an invasion on the grounds that &#145;the last objective of any intelligent invader &hellip; would be the War Office&#146;  (Asquith, 1.256). He was very fond of gossip and enjoyed the good things in life, being a connoisseur of food, wine, and cigars. He regularly attended dinners at Grillons, The Club, and the Society of Dilettanti, and was a familiar figure at Brooks's.<br>
<br>Murray was appointed KCB in 1899, GCB in 1908, and GCVO in 1920, and was sworn of the privy council in 1910. He was elected an honorary student of Christ Church in 1913. He continued to be a public servant in his retirement: on the outbreak of war in 1914 he took a leading part in the management of the Prince of Wales's Fund and in 1915 he became chairman of the committee on the employment of soldiers and sailors disabled in the war. He was a member of the Haldane committee which reported on the machinery of government in 1918. He also held directorships in a number of companies, including the Westminster Bank and the Southern Railway.<br>
<br>Murray was predeceased by his wife, who was honoured with a CBE in 1914 and died on 19 February 1932. He died at his home, 39 Bryanston Court, London, on 4 April 1936. He was survived by a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35158/', "Sir George Evelyn Pemberton Murray (1880&#150;1947)")</script> KCB, who was successively secretary to the Post Office and chairman of the board of customs and excise, and a daughter, Irene Helen.<br>
