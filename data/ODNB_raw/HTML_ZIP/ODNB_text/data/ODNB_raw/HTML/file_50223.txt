<span class="headword">Holland,  Henry</span>, second duke of Exeter  (1430&#150;1475), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, the only son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13530/', "John Holland, first duke of Exeter (1395&#150;1447)")</script>, and his first wife, Anne Stafford, dowager countess of March (<i>d</i>. 1432), was born in the Tower of London on 27 June 1430. Through his grandmother Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1425), sister of Henry IV, Henry Holland was closely related to the house of Lancaster&#151;a connection which grew in importance as Henry VI's uncles died without heirs. His proximity to the royal line justified Earl John's creation in 1444 as duke of Exeter: his estates, worth only &pound;1002 p.a. including his wife's dower in 1436, fell substantially short of the 2000 marks p.a. normally considered the minimum for a duke. Probably it was Holland's Lancastrian connections that prompted Richard, duke of York, to offer the enormous marriage portion of 4500 marks to marry his eldest daughter, <a href="#cosubject_54462">Anne [<i>see below</i>]</a>, born in 1439, to Henry on 10 August 1445: at this time several great families were speculating on the succession. The marriage was completed in January 1446, before John Holland's death in 1447, when custody of the young second duke was granted to York. On 23 July 1450, while still under age, Henry Holland was granted special livery of his lands, perhaps in response to his inclusion among the ancient royal blood of the realm that Cade's rebels wished to see involved in government.<br>
<br>Duke Henry's reckless and violent conduct in the early 1450s may have been a desperate response to financial embarrassments. There was an obvious discrepancy between his royal blood and ducal title, which demanded a conspicuously ducal lifestyle, and his limited means. A customs annuity of 500 marks p.a. was resumed in 1451, his continental possessions were reconquered by the French, he did not even enjoy his whole patrimony until after the death of his stepmother in 1457, and he personally derived no direct benefit from his duchess's dowry which, if paid, passed to his father's executors. He had really needed to marry an heiress. Exeter bid with some success to supplement his Devon patrimony, securing the custody of the Gournay lands in Somerset and Dorset in 1450 and Lostwithiel, Restormel, and other duchy of Cornwall lands in 1451, but such gains were limited and temporary.<br>
<br>Exeter inherited eight Bedfordshire manors from a cousin in 1451, which he hoped to augment into a second endowment by securing Ampthill Castle and its members. A shadowy title was improved by fraud. False charges of treason were laid against the current occupant, the rich but ageing and childless former minister Lord Cromwell, and on 2 June 1452 Exeter seized the estate by force. He was in residence on 28 August following. With right on his side, and hence support from both government and the Lords, Cromwell was a formidable opponent: the treason charge was easily repudiated; on 15 July Exeter was bound in recognizances of &pound;4000 to abide an award; and he and his agents were sued in the court of common pleas. Defeat faced Exeter if the law ran its course, so, besides initiating counter-suits, he overawed jurors and judicial officials both in Westminster Hall and Bedfordshire, where nobody would act as sheriff in 1453&#150;4, and on 19 January 1454 allied himself to Lord Egremont, one of the Percy enemies of Cromwell, the Nevilles, and hence of Exeter's father-in-law, York. At this point a local dispute acquired national political dimensions. The onset of Henry VI's madness about August 1453 might have given Exeter, as the nearest relative of the king and the young prince, power as lord protector. Instead York was appointed in March 1454, a Neville (Salisbury) became chancellor, parliament backed Cromwell over Ampthill, and Cromwell, not Exeter, was appointed to the royal council. Exeter asserted his Lancastrian claims on 21 May 1454 at Spofforth in Yorkshire by rebelling and allegedly distributing Lancastrian livery, claiming the government and the duchy of Lancaster, and plotting with the Scots. It is true that Exeter was next heir to the duchy of Lancaster, but these indictments may be best seen as the exaggerated allegations of his enemies. The lord protector rushed northwards to quell the uprising. When the rebellion failed, Exeter appeared at Westminster to answer Cromwell in court. In July York removed him from Westminster Abbey to prison at Pontefract Castle and in September Cromwell finally re-entered Ampthill. The duke was released in March 1455 after Henry VI's recovery, but was incarcerated once again at Wallingford Castle in June following the Yorkist victory at St Albans. Cromwell's death in January 1456 fortunately ensured that Exeter escaped ruinous damages and was acquitted of treason, but Ampthill was irretrievably lost.<br>
<br>Exeter's alienation from York and the Nevilles was reinforced by Salisbury's subsequent appointment as keeper of the seas, an infringement of the duke's role as hereditary lord admiral, but he was not much better trusted by York's enemies at court. An attempt to seize Warwick in November 1458 resulted in his incarceration in Berkhamsted Castle, whence he was released only on bonds of &pound;10,000 in February next year. Only then did Exeter commit himself politically to Henry VI. On the losing side at Bloreheath, he swore allegiance to Henry at Coventry on 11 December 1459, and was appointed constable of York's forfeited castle of Fotheringhay, Northamptonshire. On 19 March 1460 he indented to keep the sea with 3500 men against the Yorkist earls, but, uncertain of the loyalty of his men, dared not intercept Warwick on his return from Ireland. At the battle of Northampton Exeter was once again on the losing side; he was absent from the parliament of 1460, and joined Queen Margaret in the north, where on 20 January 1461 he was among those who guaranteed her treaty with the Scots. He marched south with her to the second battle of St Albans, retreated with her, and was on the losing side at Towton (29 March 1461). He was among those who attacked Carlisle in May, was with Jasper Tudor in Wales by July, and shared in his defeat at Twt Hill near Caernarfon on 16 October. He sailed with Queen Margaret from Edinburgh via Sluys to Burgundy, where he was in August 1463 and where Philippe de Commines allegedly saw him barefoot, begging from door to door. He was one of Margaret's impoverished court-in-exile at St Mihiel in Bar. Following Henry VI's restoration Exeter was encouraged to return to England by the duke of Burgundy, who saw him as a potential rival for Warwick. In England in February 1471, he was among those routed at Leicester on 3 April, and shared in Warwick's defeat on 14 April at Barnet, where he was wounded and left for dead. Exeter then took sanctuary in London, but was removed on 26 May and imprisoned in the Tower. Presumably Edward hesitated to execute a sick man, who had been taken from sanctuary, and was, furthermore, his brother-in-law. Exeter's wife secured a divorce on 12 November 1472 and his daughter had died by 1474, but he himself was released to join Edward IV's invasion of France in 1475, which might have led to his eventual restoration. Instead however he was drowned on the return journey, most probably by foul play; his rightful heir, Ralph Neville, later third earl of Westmorland, was not allowed to inherit.<br>

<a name="cosubject_54462"></a><span class="headword">Anne of York</span>  (1439&#150;1476)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23503/', "Richard, duke of York")</script>, born at Fotheringhay on 10 August 1439, married Henry Holland in January 1446. Only one daughter was born of the union. Following the duke's attainder in 1461 the duchess was initially provided for, like the wives of other attainted Lancastrians, by the settlement of her jointure on feoffees to her use, to ensure that nothing passed to her husband. Very soon, however, she convinced her brother Edward IV of her loyalty and commitment, and enjoyed the favour and influence appropriate to the king's sister. In 1462 she was granted her husband's goods, his whole Exeter inheritance for life, Rochford and other forfeited lands in Exeter, Hadleigh, Essex, and other forfeitures in 1465. In 1464 she was entrusted with the custody of the young Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham. She contracted her daughter Anne, first to George Neville, infant son of the earl of Northumberland and male heir of Richard Neville, earl of Warwick (the Kingmaker), then to the queen's son Thomas Grey, later marquess of Dorset, and settled lands on Grey and Anne jointly: they were married in October 1466 but she had died by February 1474, when Dorset remarried. Anne of York's titles to her Exeter lands were repeatedly amended to ensure her estate for life, the performance of her will (1467), the inheritance of her daughter (1465), remainders to any further children born to the duchess herself (1467), and to the queen (1469). Such provisions suggest a new sexual liaison long before her divorce on 12 November 1472. She married Thomas St Leger, and the couple had a daughter, also called Anne, in 1475. The duchess died in January 1476 and was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor. The sixteen-week-old Anne St Leger was regarded as the Exeter heir: in 1483 the inheritance was divided by act of parliament between the queen's younger son, Richard Grey, and Anne herself, who was contracted to Dorset's own son.<br>
