<span class="headword">Perbroun <span class="st"> [Perburn]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1342/3), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the son of Robert Perbroun of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The town was the centre of the internationally important herring trade in England and also a port that enjoyed a diversified trade with Bordeaux and other Atlantic and North Sea centres. John Perbroun became involved in all the trades underpinning the town's wealth. Between 1320 and 1324 his dealings in wine were worth at least &pound;122 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., and with those of his partners &pound;696 11<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. His purchase, with Herman Breton, a fellow burgess, of goods worth &pound;340 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in 1323&#150;4 for the purposes of trade indicates the scale of his activity at this time. His main involvement in the herring trade was as a host (surety) for foreign fishermen and as an owner of fishing boats, of which he had at least seven in 1337, and a fish house. He also dealt in wool, and owned at least four merchant ships.<br>
<br>Perbroun held many urban offices. At any one time Great Yarmouth had four bailiffs, and between 1312 and 1339 Perbroun served fifteen times as one of them. He was collector of murage in 1338&#150;9, MP in 1322 and 1323, and represented the town at merchant assemblies, summoned by the crown for the negotiation of taxes on wool, in 1327 and 1340. Moreover, as a successful merchant and shipowner, he was an obvious choice for certain royal offices, including that of admiral, the official responsible for the impressment of shipping for the king's wars. Perbroun held this office north of the Thames at least eight times between 1317 and 1341. As admiral he received a regular income and, in 1334, a royal gift of &pound;100. He was deputy to the king's butler at Yarmouth in 1323, collector of royal customs there in 1330&#150;33 and 1334&#150;41, and, with Thomas Drayton, a fellow burgess, farmer of the customs in 1333&#150;4. It is difficult not to conclude that service as admiral gave him easier access to further offices.<br>
<br>Perbroun's career was not without its dangers and blemishes. In 1314, when he was town bailiff, hostility from the rival settlement of Little Yarmouth forced him to take refuge for a time at sea. In 1327 he supported Prince Edward against his father, and was subsequently pardoned for acquiescence in Mortimer's rule. In 1333 he defaulted on sums due from customs accounts, and the king was still seeking redress in 1343, after Perbroun's death. He was both a victim of piracy and a perpetrator of it. In general, however, he prospered, and in 1332 he was taxed at &pound;3 for the subsidy on moveables, 50 per cent more than the next wealthiest burgess. In the next year his property in Yarmouth was valued at &pound;8 0<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. per annum. The sum points to a substantial but not unduly large investment in real property and suggests that much of his capital was tied up in his ships and merchandise. Perbroun had two brothers, and when he died, in 1342 or 1343, was succeeded by three sons and a daughter; his eldest son, Farman, who was taxed at 4<i>s</i>. in 1332, had three sons and four daughters. Farman, however, was impoverished in the late 1340s and died of the black death in 1348&#150;9. No Perbroun is mentioned in Yarmouth after 1364, and with the exception of Roger Perbroun, who held church livings at Howe, Brandon, and Hemsby (all in Norfolk), and who may have been related to John, no member of the family can be traced after this time in rural Norfolk or Suffolk. Unlike some other influential families, such as the Elyses, Draytons, and Fastolfs, the Perbrouns failed to establish themselves as either an urban or a rural dynasty. The fortunes of the Perbrouns, bound up in shipping and the herring trade, provide a mirror of those of Great Yarmouth more generally. Prosperity in the late thirteenth century, and the early decades of the fourteenth, was followed by misfortune and decline, started by the Hundred Years' War and accentuated by the black death.<br>
