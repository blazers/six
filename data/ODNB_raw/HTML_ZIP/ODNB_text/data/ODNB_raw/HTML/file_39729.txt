<span class="headword">Mendes da Costa,  Philip Jacob</span>  (1708&#150;1780), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in London on 24 February 1708, the elder surviving son of John Abraham Mendes da Costa (1683&#150;1763), a rich Anglo-Jewish merchant of St Christopher-le-Stocks in the City of London, whose father had fled from Portugal to France to escape the attentions of the Inquisition. The family moved to London from Rouen about 1696 and joined other members of the family in the Anglo-Indian diamond trade and the import of gold and other commodities. In 1702 John Mendes da Costa married Johanna Ester (1692&#150;1749), a daughter of the important merchant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39727/', "Alvaro da Costa (1646&#150;1716)")</script>; they had nine children, the youngest of whom was the naturalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6374/', "Emanuel Mendes da Costa (1717&#150;1791)")</script>. As a youth, Philip Mendes da Costa spent some time in the Netherlands, presumably gaining mercantile experience with the Amsterdam branch of his family. Back in London in the mid-1720s, he led the life of a rich young blade and reputedly traded on his own account, presumably in the Anglo-Indian trade.<br>
<br>It seems that a marriage was intended between Philip Mendes da Costa and his first cousin, Catherine Rachel (Kitty) da Costa (1710&#150;1747), but he acquired a dubious reputation as a rake and fortune-hunter and Kitty was married off in 1727 to the rich Joseph Isaac Villareal (1673&#150;1730). When Villareal died, on 27 December 1730, Kitty speedily agreed to marry her former suitor, but under family pressure later rejected him. On 11 January 1732 Mendes da Costa, now using his Hebrew forename of Jacob, involved his family in a scandalous lawsuit by bringing an action against his cousin in the ecclesiastical court of arches, at Doctors' Commons, for breach of promise, the first Jew ever to do such a thing. His application for fulfilment of a marriage contract or damages of &pound;100,000, and a subsequent suit for similar damages at the king's bench, were dismissed on the grounds that Kitty's promise of marriage had been conditional on her father's consent, which was refused. The vindictive Mendes da Costa promptly published a partial and embittered account of the trial, probably printed by the notorious Edmund Curll. M. J. Landa suggests that Mendes da Costa was the inspiration for the caricatural Jew in the second scene of Hogarth's <span class="italic">Harlot's Progress</span> of 1732.<br>
<br>Presumably as a consequence of the public scandal, Mendes da Costa, still only in his mid-twenties, was dispatched to Hamburg, which had one of the oldest Sephardic communities in Europe. He settled there permanently and formed a connection with the mercantile family of Bravo (which also had a branch in London) by marrying two daughters of the family in succession. During the course of the century, Hamburg, gradually dispensing with the intermediary services of Amsterdam, developed direct connections with London for the purchase of colonial goods of divers sorts, including coffee, hides, and tobacco, as well as diamonds. The Englishman may well have been a useful link between the cities. He was not, however, a successful businessman. In 1746 Frederick I invited rich Portuguese Jews to settle in Sweden as traders; &#145;Jacob Mendes da Costa of Hamburg Altona&#146; acted as spokesman and negotiator for a group of twenty-two Jews. But the merchants were unenthusiastic and, worse, Mendes da Costa turned out to be bankrupt. The project was dropped. His subsequent career is unrecorded; he died at Altona in April or May 1780, leaving one daughter, Esther.<br>
