<span class="headword">Brown,  Henton</span>  (1697/8&#150;1775), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and banker</span>, of unknown parentage, was born in London. He was educated by Friends, and in 1718 he married Sarah, of whom further details are unknown, in an Anglican ceremony, contrary to the beliefs of the society. The couple repented this action and their acknowledgement of wrongdoing was accepted by the society on 20 January 1720. The couple had eleven children, many of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>When he was twenty-five Brown made his first public testimony of his faith and was &#145;measurably preserved in faithfulness&#146;  (Testimonies, 3.97). On 28 November 1731 he was accepted as a minister of the society, following a recommendation by the Horsleydown meeting, Southwark. Brown's ministry was nevertheless commented upon by William Gibson in his <span class="italic">Saul's Errand to Damascus</span> (1728), in which he criticized Brown's reflections upon &#145;Inward and Spiritual Grace&#146;  (Gibson, 11). Between 1726 and 1735 Brown wrote several treatises defending the Society of Friends from attacks by William Bromfield and by William Notcutt, notably <span class="italic">An Examination of William Bromfield's Principles</span> (1726) and <span class="italic">A Vindication of Robert Barclay's Apology &hellip; Against the Attempts of William Notcut</span> (1732). In 1727 a manuscript written by Brown against Bromfield was submitted to the morning meeting but, on 16 October 1727, was rejected by Friends who thought it more prudent to stay out of the argument. This presumably was Brown's <span class="italic">The Divine and Human Natures United in the Person of Jesus Christ</span> (1727). In 1735 Brown again attacked Bromfield in <span class="italic">An Examination of William Notcutt's Reply to H.B.'s Vindication</span>. In this period Brown, along with other Friends, warmly congratulated the prince of Orange on his marriage to the princess royal. Between 1743 and 1763 Brown wrote several addresses to the crown, including commentaries on the Jacobite rising, the accession of George III, the king's marriage to Queen Charlotte and the royal birth, and on the negotiation of peace with France in 1763. Brown was also interested in issues which affected the Quaker community and was an influential member of the yearly meeting and meeting for sufferings.<br>
<br>In 1744 Brown travelled, as a Quaker minister, through Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, visiting Friends, where, &#145;being a man of strong natural parts, and having acquired reputation on this account, he became acquainted with several persons of considerable rank, and gradually fell into much business, and a variety of worldly engagements&#146; (Testimonies, 3.97; &#145;Dictionary of Quaker biography&#146;). By 1748 Brown, with his son James (1721&#150;1781), had established his own bank, Henton Brown &amp; Son. Benjamin Franklin became an important client during his first visit to Britain as a provincial agent for Pennsylvania. Later Thomas Collinson (1727&#150;1803), the husband of Brown's youngest daughter, Sarah, became a partner, and the bank changed its name to Brown and Collinson in 1770. His grandson John Henton Tritton (1753&#150;1833), the son of his second daughter, Anna Maria, and her husband, Thomas Tritton (1717&#150;1786), was left a partnership in the bank in Brown's will. Tritton's right to a quarter share of the business was nevertheless conditional on his completion of an apprenticeship and his reaching his majority.<br>
<br>Brown also participated in a lively correspondence with John Fothergill (1712&#150;1780) and the Philadelphian James Pemberton (1723&#150;1809) on the issues affecting the society in America. In May 1754 Brown waited on the new governor of Pennsylvania, Robert Hunter Morris, and on 21 March 1755, along with Fothergill, David Barclay, Silvanus Bevan, and Capel Hanbury, he became a committee member appointed by the meeting for sufferings to examine Friends' needs in the state. On 8 April 1766, with John Fothergill, he also wrote a formal attestation on behalf of Benjamin Franklin, to reassure the German community in Pennsylvania of Franklin's &#145;loyalty to the colonial cause&#146;  (Corner and Booth, 262).<br>
<br>By May 1750 Brown had obtained permission from Friends at the Horsleydown monthly meeting to move, with his family, to the monthly meeting at Gracechurch Street, London. This action was presumably taken in order to be nearer to his bank on Lombard Street. By 1754, however, Brown had also become prosperous enough to own the leasehold of a country house on Clapham Common, near Mount Pond. His good fortune clearly troubled his conscience, as he complained to a friend, in 1764, that he had spent too much time acquiring material wealth, commenting, &#145;What end will it answer, what end will it answer? It may possibly find wings for my children to fly from the blessed truth&#146; (Testimonies, 3.98; &#145;Dictionary of Quaker biography&#146;). Although Brown was a &#145;pretty constant attender of &hellip; [Wandsworth] meeting, as well as a benefactor to it&#146;  (&#145;Dictionary of Quaker biography&#146;), he retained his membership of the Gracechurch Street meeting, and it is possible that he may have attended the London two weeks meeting for Gracechurch Street. It is further known that as a member of the Horsleydown monthly meeting between 1728 and 1743 he was on the committee concerned with the Friends' workhouse, and he attended London yearly meeting in 1735, 1754, and 1759. He may well have attended more meetings than this, for in 1775, in spite of ill health and the need to be supported by two other Friends, he is noted as having attended yearly meeting.<br>
<br>Henton Brown died of dropsy at his country residence, near Mount Pond, Clapham Common, on 23 September 1775 aged seventy-seven, after a long illness, and was interred at the Quaker burial-ground at Long Lane, Southwark, on 1 October 1775. His will, which was proved on 23 October 1775, included a &pound;100 bequest for building a new meeting-house at Wandsworth, but this was cancelled by the addition of a codicil, written in 1774, which acknowledged that Brown had paid &pound;40 towards the repairs of the old meeting-house. Brown's total bequests were in excess of &pound;30,000 (excluding properties) and he bequeathed &pound;100 for the Friends' workhouse at Clerkenwell, and &pound;50 and &pound;20 respectively for poor members at the Gracechurch Street and Wandsworth meetings.<br>
