<span class="headword">Lyon,  John</span>  (1514?&#150;1592), <span class="occ">founder of Harrow School</span>, was the son of John Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1534) and his wife, Joan; the family owned land in Preston near Harrow. A man of substance, by 1562 John Lyon had the largest rental in Harrow. He had a long-standing interest in education, having for many years spent 20 marks a year on the education of thirty poor children. In February 1572 he obtained a royal charter for the foundation of a free grammar school for boys at Harrow. He bought lands in Marylebone to be held by himself, his wife, and the governors of his school, the rents to be applied to road repairs on the Harrow and Edgware roads. In 1579 it was proposed that Lyon should pay &pound;50 as a loan to the state but the attorney-general, Sir Gilbert Gerard (a trustee and governor), intervened, arguing that paying would involve selling lands that would otherwise have been used to maintain the school. No buildings were erected until after the death of Lyon's widow, Joan, in 1608 when money was made available according to his instructions.<br>
<br>In 1591 Lyon drew up statutes for the future conduct of the school. The governors were to appoint the master and usher who were to be paid &pound;20 and &pound;10 per annum. They had to behave themselves well and neither was permitted to marry. &pound;300 was to be set aside to construct a building for the school and to house the schoolmasters; additional funds were provided for heating. Thirty good and learned sermons were to be preached annually at the rate of 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per sermon, &pound;20 per annum was to be distributed annually among the poorest families, and &pound;20 given to four poor scholars to enable them to study at Oxford and Cambridge. To be admitted to the second form boys had to be able to write out sentences before they could learn how to translate English into Latin. The statutes laid down in detail the curriculum to be taught over five years, which consisted of mainly Latin authors with some Greek for the fifth form, together with the catechism, Lord's prayer, ten commandments, and the articles of faith. The schoolmaster was to be responsible for the conduct of his charges, severely punishing lying, stealing, fighting, and filthiness, although the rod was only to be used moderately. Play was permitted on Thursdays and occasionally on Sundays, and archery was encouraged. The governors were to provide all the library books needed, but the parents were to supply paper, ink, pens, books, and candles for the winter.<br>
<br>Building began after Joan Lyon's death but the cost was more than double that envisaged in the statutes and took until 1615 to complete. The first scholar was elected to university in 1617. At first the value of John Lyon's funds were barely sufficient to cover the cost of maintaining the school, but subsequent changes in land values altered the situation entirely. The development of Harrow from a free grammar school into a public school was made possible by a clause in the statutes which permitted the master to admit boys from outside the parish if there was space and the governors agreed. By the beginning of the nineteenth century it was considered that there were so many &#145;foreigners&#146; that parishioners were deterred from sending their own children. Following the report of the Clarendon commission in 1864 and the <span class="roman">Public School Act</span> of 1868 the Harrow School governors in 1874 created the lower school of John Lyon which by the early twentieth century had become autonomous. The fund originally intended for road maintenance was handed over for other charitable purposes in 1991 and in 1999 was still actively supporting education. John Lyon died on 3 October 1592, and was buried in Harrow church, where a brass memorial tablet was later erected to both him and his wife.<br>
