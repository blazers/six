<span class="headword">Grant <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Newsome]</span>,  Helen Frances</span>  (1903&#150;1992), <span class="occ">Spanish scholar</span>, was born at Pill St George, Long Ashton, Somerset, on 26 December 1903, the daughter of Herbert Newsome, medical practitioner, and his wife, Christine Marguerite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbs. She attended a private school in Clifton and a finishing school in Lausanne. In 1921 she took a job in Brussels as secretary to a British accountant, who, she discovered, was involved in the arms trade and industrial espionage (in particular, trying to get hold of the secret process of making bakelite). In 1924 she became secretary to the attorney-general of Sierra Leone, and then to Walter de la Mare. Meeting his many cultivated friends decided her on applying to university. She initially thought of applying to Bristol, but her father had links with the principal of Somerville College, Margery Fry, who encouraged her to apply instead to Oxford. She did, and but for her age, she learned, she would have gained a scholarship. In 1927 she went to read French and Spanish. Her undergraduate years were fruitful. In 1928 she stayed in Granada with the socialist politician and intellectual Fernando de los R&iacute;os. It was then that she first read poems by Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca, a great friend of her hosts. She maintained contact with the poet's family ever afterwards. Back in Oxford she met other distinguished figures in Spanish letters who were passing through. The Hispanist J. B. Trend also visited. The professor of Spanish, Salvador de Madariaga, was joined in 1929 by the poet Jorge Guill&eacute;n. Helen formed a lasting friendship with him and his family. He helped her with her translation of D&iacute;az Fern&aacute;ndez's novel <span class="italic">El blocao</span>, published in 1930, the year in which she graduated with a second-class degree. Her time in Oxford was significant in two other ways. First, it saw her political awakening. She became and remained a stout-hearted member of the Labour Party, and an active defender of humanitarian values. Second, it was there that she met Alexander Thomas Kingdom (Alec) Grant (1906&#150;1988), then an undergraduate at University College, later a distinguished economist and civil servant. They married on 19 July 1930; there were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Supporters from the outset of the republican government that came to power in Spain in 1931, Alec and Helen Grant maintained this commitment after the outbreak of the civil war. In March and April 1937, although not herself a Quaker, Helen went to Spain as interpreter for a relief group sent by the Society of Friends, and kept a vivid diary of her experiences, later deposited in Cambridge University Library. Back in Britain she raised funds for Spain. On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 she joined the Royal Institute of International Affairs foreign research and press service, based in Oxford, in 1941 moving on to the BBC European service.<br>
<br>In 1945 Helen Grant returned to academic life. She had already, from 1934 to 1939, been assistant lecturer in Spanish at Birmingham, combining that post with responsibility for Spanish teaching at Somerville and St Hilda's colleges in Oxford. Now she was appointed to a university lectureship at Cambridge, under Trend. From 1949 to 1964 she lived in Girton College, commuting at weekends to London to be with her husband. Girton elected her to a supernumerary fellowship in 1954 and a lectureship in Spanish from 1955, with an interval from 1955 to 1958 as a tutor and official fellow. On her husband's retirement from London and election to a fellowship of Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1966, she took a cookery course and they set up house in Cambridge, keen hosts to old and young alike.<br>
<br>Grant's lectures delighted generations of undergraduates by their unpretentiousness, lively-mindedness, and first-hand knowledge of her subjects. Her supervisions, of both undergraduates and postgraduates, were similarly inspiring: with kindliness and patience she encouraged her pupils to independent thought. She was utterly generous in sharing her reading, ideas, and personal experience. She thus launched many teachers of her subject in schools and universities. As her <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist remarked, &#145;the pleasure she took in the success of the young was unselfish and complete&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 June 1992). Unfeignedly modest, her reviews of other scholars' work brought out what was positive in it.<br>
<br>On her own retirement in 1971 Helen Grant was elected to a life fellowship of Girton, and pursued research into the theme of the &#145;world upside down&#146; (a carnivalesque topos pointing to the inversion of worldly values, and represented by such things as animals hunting humans or people standing on their heads). Earlier in her career she co-edited a selection of the romantic Mariano Jos&eacute; de Larra's critical writings, and published with insight on Antonio Machado and Lorca, with special awareness of their indebtedness to native strains of folk literature. She was honoured by a Festschrift in 1972, and the Lazo de Dama de la Orden de Isabel la Cat&oacute;lica, bestowed on her in 1988 by the Spanish crown, was a welcome recognition of her contributions to Hispanism in Britain and beyond. Her husband predeceased her in 1988 and, much as she refused to give in to the infirmities of old age, she eventually needed professional care. Following cancer and a stroke, she died in the Hope Residential and Nursing Care Home in Brooklands Avenue, Cambridge, on 5 May 1992, and was cremated at the Cambridge crematorium on 14 May 1992 after a funeral service at St Mark's Church, Barton Road. A memorial service was held on 27 February 1993 at Girton College.<br>
