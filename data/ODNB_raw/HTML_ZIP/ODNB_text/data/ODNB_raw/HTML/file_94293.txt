<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bridgeman, Sir  John</span>  (1568/9&#150;1638), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the only son of John Bridgeman of Mitcheldean and Sudeley in Gloucestershire and Anne, daughter of William Gernon of Herefordshire. His father was a younger son in an aspiring gentry family settled on the eastern edge of the Forest of Dean; Sir John, helped by his education and an astute marriage, was its first member to achieve prominence, as both a substantial landowner and a provincial lawyer with a wide sphere of influence.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandfirstpromotion"></a>Early career and first promotion</h2>After matriculating from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in June 1582, aged thirteen, Bridgeman spent some years at Clifford's Inn, an inn of chancery, to which he formed such an attachment that he later presented it with a window displaying the Bridgeman coat of arms. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in June 1591, called to the bar in 1600, and made a bencher in 1615. Having gained early commendation from the auditor of the duchy of Lancaster in northern parts, he seems to have practised most often in the court of common pleas, and compiled a report of its proceedings between 1613 and 1621 (not published until 1659). In 1614 he was appointed counsel for the city of Gloucester, but the city of Exeter did more to advance his reputation, employing him in July 1622 in its successful struggle to prevent the unprecedented intrusion of Bishop Valentine Carey into the civic peace commission. At much the same time Edward la Zouche, eleventh Baron Zouche, a former president of the council in the marches, began to engage Bridgeman as legal counsel. On 30 June 1623 Bridgeman became one of thirteen new councillors in the marches; three months later he was made a serjeant-at-law, and on 7 December he was knighted at Whitehall.<br>
<br>In February 1626 Sir Thomas Coventry, who was not only attorney-general but also a former fellow student of Bridgeman's at the Inner Temple and his near-neighbour in Worcestershire, did much to advance Sir John to the chief justiceship of Chester, vacant since April 1625. The duke of Buckingham's earlier attempts to secure the place for the notorious Shropshire baronet Sir Thomas Harris came to nothing. In his new office Bridgeman presided at assizes for the county of Cheshire, and over great sessions on the north-eastern Welsh circuit of Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Anglesey. He also occupied a prominent place in the council in the marches of Wales, where he regularly deputized for an absentee president, and was named in peace commissions for Herefordshire, Monmouthshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire, in addition to those of Chester, Gloucestershire (where he was also <i>custos rotulorum</i> for a time), and the twelve counties of Wales. Recorderships for Gloucester, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, and Wenlock soon followed. For the rest of his life Bridgeman devoted himself to the region in which he had his roots, and unlike his immediate predecessors Sir James Whitelocke and Sir Thomas Chamberlain seems never to have hankered after a place on the Westminster bench.<h2>
<a name="ChiefjusticeofChester16261638"></a>Chief justice of Chester, 1626&#150;1638</h2>In his administrative round Bridgeman was notably conscientious, for example never missing a Cheshire assize session between 1626 and his death. He also appears to have been merciful, both in his judgments and his sentencing. But despite his adding of his kinsman John Greene to Chester's council, his part in settling the city's internal wrangling provoked by rivalry between the Whitby and Mainwaring factions was never entirely happy. As common-law judges neither he nor his colleague Sir Marmaduke Lloyd fitted comfortably into the processes of conciliation favoured both by the privy council and by Chester's accustomed broker, Thomas Savage, Viscount Savage. Savage and the privy council were looking for sensible compromise, not necessarily based on strict law, but intended rather to produce a lasting settlement acceptable to all parties.<br>
<br>The relations of Bridgeman and his fellow marchers with the central government suffered from a lack of satisfactory definition, despite the election <i>ex officio</i> of its president to the privy council in November 1629, and they did so even after Charles I reasserted his commitment to the full exercise of local justice in 1631. Too often the privy council devolved the drudgery of establishing the detailed facts of a complex and tedious case upon Bridgeman and his colleagues, while reserving to itself the final power of decision. It thus appeared to deny the council in the marches its intended authority, slighted its regional standing, and encouraged the senior gentry to regard Westminster as their place of first resort. Yet there were occasions of co-operation. It seems likely that an undated set of twenty-six questions from lords of Welsh manors, with resolutions supplied by Bridgeman, was prompted by the privy council's launch in January 1631 of the earl of Manchester's <span class="roman">Book of Orders</span>, which gave Sir John sole responsibility for the book's reception in Wales while the presidency of the council in the marches was vacant. Both questions and resolutions relate closely to the book's &#145;directions&#146; concerning the responsibilities of landlords and stewards, and their exhaustive coverage suggests that it was regarded as a necessary exercise. Bridgeman felt justified in asking for the unusually large fee of &pound;40 for his labour.<br>
<br>By the mid-1630s, already suffering from a lack of profitable business, the council in the marches was further threatened by the determination of Sir John Lambe, the dean of arches in the province of Canterbury, to win back testamentary business and jurisdiction over sexual immorality for the church courts. Bridgeman and his new president, John Egerton, first earl of Bridgewater, began to hunt out suitable precedents and to fear for the future of their own court. They were not well placed, in Bridgeman's case because he was regarded with suspicion by Archbishop William Laud, who seems to have distrusted the growing warmth between the judge, now settled at Prinknash, and his new neighbour Godfrey Goodman, the wayward bishop of Gloucester. By February 1637 Laud was reporting to Charles I that much good might be done &#145;in a church way&#146; if officials were &#145;not overborne&#146; by the court in the marches  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.345), and his efforts to constrain the council by depriving it of revenue from incontinence and testamentary cases, and by challenging its authority to deal more generally in church matters concerning the laity, came to have royal support. By 1638 very few of the disputed cases were reaching Ludlow.<br>
<br>Long before then Bridgeman had come to appreciate that there were other ways in which government policies might impinge upon local susceptibilities. In 1626&#150;7 he was active in securing a reluctant acceptance of the forced loan in most of the marcher counties. When Gloucester was threatened with forced billeting Bridgeman, as the city's recorder, wrote privately to Coventry on 26 February 1628, preparing the ground for an appeal by the mayor and aldermen that may have shortened the troops' stay. He was involved from the first in the king's efforts to increase his revenues from the royal forests, and played his part in dealing with the widespread unrest arising from the policy. He took part in three surveys of Braydon Forest in Wiltshire between 1626 and 1629, before applying himself in 1631&#150;2 to the Forest of Dean, a larger forest with important connections with the navy. Difficulties in the terrain, which made evasion easy, and intimidation of witnesses, meant that indictments far outnumbered arrests, but Bridgeman still came to be regarded as &#145;the one official the privy council could trust&#146;  (Sharp, 123). He remained in good standing at further forest courts (&#145;justice seats&#146;) for Dean in July 1634, and for New and Chute forests in Hampshire and Rockingham Forest in Northamptonshire in June 1635. By contrast his role in the collection of ship money, when the tax was extended from coastal to inland counties, remains unclear. His main duty was to settle disputed assessments in Wales and the marches, which often meant upsetting ratings already made, and his last days were accordingly disturbed by the protests of aggrieved high sheriffs, mingling discordantly with the admonitions of Archbishop Laud.<h2>
<a name="Familyandestate"></a>Family and estate</h2>By 1606 Bridgeman married Frances, daughter and sole heir of Henry Daunt of Owlpen, near Dursley, in Gloucestershire east of the Severn. The early deaths of her father and only brother had allowed the family home to pass into the hands of her uncle, so she and Bridgeman settled instead in Nympsfield, a few miles north. They had four sons (George, William, Thomas, and John), and three daughters (Elizabeth, Ann, and Mary). After becoming chief justice of Chester Bridgeman also acquired the last abbot of Gloucester's country retreat at Prinknash, a few miles south-east of the city. He added a battlemented two-storey porch to the front of the house and rebuilt its crumbling chapel, for which Bishop Goodman conducted an elaborate consecration service in May 1629. He continued almost to the end of his life to buy small parcels of land and to acquire leases and tithes, some of them from the cathedral chapter. The principal beneficiary of Bridgeman's activity in the property market was his eldest son, George, who married Heveningham Potts, the daughter of a south Worcestershire JP, and with his father's assistance entered public life. In 1628, aged twenty-one, George was returned to parliament as second burgess for Wenlock, where Sir John was recorder; at twenty-seven he was sworn in as a marches councillor; and two years later Bishop Goodman allowed him to make the presentation to his own Gloucestershire living of Kemerton.<br>
<br>When Sir John Bridgeman began to make his will, at Ludlow on 28 November 1637, the disposition of most of his property had evidently been decided. He was then &#145;somewhat ill in bodie&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/176/30). His will resumed on 5 February 1638, the day he died. Probably in response to questions, he made a short series of succinct bequests which included &pound;1500 for his unmarried daughter Mary and &pound;100 each for his sons George and John. Much else was left to the discretion of his wife, including provision for his servants and for the local poor. She also had to arrange for his burial. She settled on St Lawrence's Church in Ludlow, where a black and white marble monument was erected in its north chapel, possibly the work of Francesco Fanelli.<br>
<br>Bridgeman's surviving papers show his public face, as a talented lawyer and a capable administrator. Always concerned for his reputation but not unduly ambitious, he was apparently content to devote his energies to his western jurisdiction, and to enjoy amicable relations with its successive presidents. At the same time he was astute enough to keep in regular contact with his friends at court, especially Coventry, and was thereby largely able to maintain his position. Overall he showed himself a man who was more concerned with the particular details of policy than with its general tenor. His service on three forest &#145;justice seats&#146; attracted little attention and no censure. His attitude to the church was opaque even to Laud. Even so, he could not avert the attentions of the archbishop as he threatened to undermine a conciliar court on whose integrity Charles I had always insisted, and for all Bridgeman's circumspection, its future at the time of his death looked far from settled.<br>
