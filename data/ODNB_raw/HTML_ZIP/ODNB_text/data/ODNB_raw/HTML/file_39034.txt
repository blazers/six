<span class="headword">Pain,  James Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1836, <em>d.</em> 1923), <span class="occ">fireworks manufacturer</span>, was baptized on 20 November 1836 at St Mary's parish church, Lambeth, the son of William Pain, pyrotechnist, and his wife Eliza, who were then living at Walnut Tree Walk, Lambeth. Although James Pain was the founder of the business named after him, he was seventh in descent from a Pain mentioned in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> in 1670 as a gunpowder seller.<br>
<br>Pain was probably apprenticed to his father, who would have trained him in the increasingly sophisticated science of pyrotechnics. Although fireworks themselves are of ancient Chinese origin, and were used in crude form in medieval times in Europe to celebrate military victories, more specialized kinds of fireworks, such as the Catherine wheel, are first recorded only in the eighteenth century, and it was not until the nineteenth century that new ingredients, such as magnesium and aluminium, could be added to the staple gunpowder base to achieve a colourful and brilliant display.<br>
<br>On 26 November 1855, at the church where he was baptized, Pain married his first wife, Mary Ann Craig, a musician's daughter, also of Lambeth. They had six sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>About 1860 Pain set up his own fireworks business at 20 Albion Place (later Heygate Street), off Walworth Road, south-east London. Following a fire at the premises in 1864, however, he moved to no. 10 in the same street, and later to no. 15. On 29 September 1873 Pain took a lease on 121 Walworth Road, and at about the same time opened a factory at Brixton, subsequently transferring the works to a new factory in Mitcham about 1878. It was at this stage that he added the manufacture of marine distress flares to the production of conventional fireworks.<br>
<br>Pain made many visits abroad in the course of his business, travelling to New York, Australia, and Portugal, among other places. In Portugal he was awarded the order of knight of the order of Christ for services to the Portuguese royal family. While on his travels he married his second wife, Elizabeth Ramsay, <i>n&eacute;e</i> May, a Scot, his first wife having died on 12 September 1884. Pain subsequently moved to Argyll Lodge, Atkins Road, Balham, and Elizabeth Pain died there in 1902, leaving her estate to her daughter from her first marriage.<br>
<br>By the early 1920s Pain had seen his firm grow into manufacturers of, and contractors for, illuminations and decorations at several towns and sites, while the chief company works at Mitcham covered over 200 acres, with branches at Manchester, Liverpool, and Gravesend. He died of cystitis and acute orchitis on 12 October 1923 at his home, 56 Moyser Road, Streatham, leaving the business in the hands of his sons Philip, in England, and Henry, in the United States. He was buried at Mitcham parish church.<br>
