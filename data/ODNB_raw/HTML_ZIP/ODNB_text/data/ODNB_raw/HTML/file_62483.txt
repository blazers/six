<span class="headword">Booth,  Bartholomew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1732, <em>d.</em> 1785), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster</span>, was born at Mellor, Derbyshire, where he was baptized in the village chapel on 7 October 1732, the son of Bartholomew Booth (<i>d</i>. 1750), the village schoolmaster. His family appears to have belonged to a cadet branch of the Booth family of Dunham Massey, Cheshire, earls of Warrington and barons Delamer. Taught initially by his father, Booth continued his education at Manchester grammar school from 1750 to 1752 before taking up a temporary post as usher to the schoolmaster at Marple, Cheshire. He married Mary Chatterton (<i>d</i>. 1789) of Marple on 6 March 1753, and from 1754 was a student at Brasenose College, Oxford, which he left in 1756 without taking a degree.<br>
<br>Appointed master of the charity school at Disley, Cheshire, in 1756, Booth served as a deacon at Disley before his ordination as a priest at Chester on 2 July 1758 and his appointment in 1760 as curate of Marple chapel. When his wife's growing mental instability intensified shortly thereafter, he separated from her and took custody of William and Robert, the elder two of their three sons. After a series of brief curacies in Derbyshire&#151;at St Alkmund's, Derby, in 1762 and Brassington in 1764&#151;and an equally brief period as second master of Derby grammar school in 1763&#150;4, he moved to Liverpool, where he opened a private academy on the waterfront in 1765. There he quickly gained the patronage of two wealthy sisters, Mary Valens (1740&#150;1810), who thereafter became his &#145;constant companion&#146;, and Anne Bardsley (1732&#150;1781), a young widow. With their assistance, both financial and domestic, Booth opened in 1766 Woolton Academy, a boarding-school located at Woolton Hall, near Liverpool. There he and his assistant master, Peter Newby (1745&#150;1827), offered an unusually wide and enlightened curriculum, comprising English grammar, Latin, Greek, French, German, writing, arithmetic, merchants' accounts, geography, navigation, astronomy, surveying, mathematics, drawing, perspective, music, dancing, and fencing. This type of education, which echoed much of Benjamin Franklin's educational philosophy, attracted the sons of the landed and mercantile classes from all parts of England and from North America, among whom were the future bibliophile George Hibbert (1757&#150;1837) and the future general and MP Isaac Gascoyne (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1841).<br>
<br>After selling Woolton Hall in 1772, Booth moved his academy briefly to High Beach in Essex, before emigrating to Maryland with his two sons and two patronesses in the summer of 1773 to begin a new life away from the &#145;mean repinings&#146;  (Newby, 51) of his wife. Again with the financial assistance of his two female companions Booth purchased a substantial tract of land called the Forest of Needwood, near Frederick, in western Maryland, where he planned to spend the rest of his days quietly as a planter. Unusually for an Anglican clergyman, Booth identified with the republican cause at the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Following considerable pressure from certain of the American leaders who were aware of his sound reputation as a schoolmaster in England, he sought and eventually obtained extraordinary permission from the Maryland legislature to open at the Forest of Needwood an academy which operated from 1778 until 1785. To this school, which was one of the few in the emerging United States to exist without interruption throughout the war, significant numbers of prominent Americans sent their sons. Booth's patrons included General Benedict Arnold, Dr James Craik, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Morris, the financier of the revolution, Dr William Shippen, and George Washington, whose nephew and heir Bushrod Washington was Booth's student.<br>
<br>Despite his close and unwavering identification with the republican cause, Booth, as a recent English immigrant, was viewed with suspicion by the local populace in western Maryland. He was eventually forced to move his academy in 1783 to a new estate in Maryland, close to modern Hagerstown, to which he gave the name Delamer. There his educational work continued until an unspecified illness led to his untimely death on or about 10 September 1785; he was buried on his estate a few days later.<br>
<br>Booth's two elder sons perished at sea in the winter of 1785 <i>en route</i> from Maryland for Britain on a visit to their estranged mother and their younger brother, John. The latter emigrated to the United States in 1786 to claim his inheritance, but a considerable part of the schoolmaster's large estate, valued at &pound;8445 in Maryland currency, reverted on his death to Mary Valens, who in 1786 married Booth's close friend and confidant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10447/', "General Horatio Gates (1727?&#150;1806)")</script>.<br>
<br>Bartholomew Booth owed his success as an educator to a number of factors. His ability to combine skilfully all that was best in the classical tradition with the most useful elements of a &#145;modern&#146; curriculum appealed greatly to enlightened parents on both sides of the Atlantic; and the substantial financial support of his two patronesses, combined with the continued support of a tightly knit, transatlantic, and largely masonic network of educational patrons, helped to give his work a prominence that it might not otherwise have enjoyed.<br>
