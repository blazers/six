</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ward,  Irene Mary Bewick</span>, Baroness Ward of North Tyneside  (1895&#150;1980), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 28 St Stephen's Mansions, Westminster, London, on 23 February 1895, the only child of (Alfred) John Bewick Ward (1855/6&#150;1901), an architect who designed some of the mosaics in Westminster Cathedral, and his wife, Elvina Mary Ellis (<i>d</i>. 1944). After the death of her husband, who left his family in straitened circumstances, Elvina moved with Irene to Newcastle upon Tyne, and eventually settled in Gosforth, where an uncle paid for their lodgings and Irene's education at Newcastle Church High School. Elvina ensured that her daughter grew up aware of the wider world, including women's suffrage&#151;an issue which interested mother more than daughter. Despite the lack of money, Irene had elocution and dancing lessons, acted in amateur dramatics, and was taken by her mother to the theatre. At sixteen she wanted to be a writer&#151;some of her stories were published in the local press&#151;but she earned her living as a secretary, her work for the coalowner and Liberal MP Sir Cecil Cochrane being the most significant of her various posts. He gave her financial support in the early stages of her career. During the First World War she delivered her first public speech, deputizing for the head of the Voluntary Aid Detachment unit of the St John Ambulance Brigade to address stretcher-bearers leaving for the front.<br>
<br>Acting as a poll clerk in the 1918 general election probably marked the beginning of Ward's political activity. Her friendship with Sir George Renwick MP and Lady Renwick led in 1920 to an invitation to be the central Newcastle Conservative association's honorary secretary. At the 1923 Conservative Party conference at Plymouth her public-speaking skills brought her to the attention of the party leadership. She was invited to contest Morpeth in the 1924 general election (despite being too young to vote) after she had failed to be selected for Wansbeck. The party's chief organizer, Sir T. J. Leigh Maclachlan, was impressed by the manner in which she took the Wansbeck rejection and advised the Morpeth constituency association that the party would pay her election expenses. The seat was unwinnable in 1924 but Irene put up a spirited fight, and came second to the Labour candidate. Her bravery in dealing with the unorthodox tactics of some of her opponent's supporters won her electorate's regard and instilled in her a lifelong respect for miners.<br>
<br>Undeterred by another unsuccessful contest at Morpeth in 1929, Ward was one of the sixty-two women candidates to stand at the 1931 general election. In one of the two all-women contests at that election she defeated her Labour opponent, Margaret Bondfield, at Wallsend. On the night of her victory she vowed never to forget her obligation to maintain the trust of those constituents who were not natural Conservative voters. Despite her later description of herself as a progressive Conservative and membership of the Tory Reform Group, her own brand of Conservatism was essentially pragmatic and too personal to lead to ministerial office. But she thrived as a back-bencher. Before the war she was one of the two most frequent women speakers from the 1931 intake.<br>
<br>Ward's maiden speech in May 1932 during the debate on the <span class="roman">Coal Mines Bill</span> criticized the government for failing to guarantee miners' wages. She was not the only woman MP to master &#145;masculine&#146; topics such as shipbuilding, engineering, and mining, but this mastery, and her tenacity and zest, contributed to her re-election for Wallsend in 1935. That result was very much a personal triumph, for several of her male colleagues in the north-east lost their seats and the number of Conservative women MPs was cut from twelve to six.<br>
<br>Ward's lifelong campaign against injustice and in defence of the individual stemmed from her belief that though she had known &#145;hard luck&#146;, many others had known harder luck and she had a duty to them. The first of the four private members' bills which she successfully introduced (still an unbroken record at the end of the century) was an amendment in 1937 to the <span class="roman">Poor Law Act</span>, allocating 2<i>s</i>. weekly pocket money to elderly inhabitants in poor-law institutions. She championed international as well as national and constituency causes. Between 1933 and 1935 she campaigned to ensure that Indian women's suffrage was incorporated into the <span class="roman">Government of India Bill</span>. In 1937 and 1938 she was a member of a committee of MPs concerned with the evacuation of women and children during the Spanish Civil War; and she represented Britain at the League of Nations. During the Second World War she was concerned with issues of women's employment and equal pay; she chaired the women's power committee, which advised the Ministry of Labour, and visited factories and Auxiliary Territorial Service bases. From August 1943 to February 1944 she travelled through China, India, and the Middle East on behalf of the Ministry of Information, explaining the British war effort; later she visited newly liberated France.<br>
<br>After losing her Wallsend seat in the 1945 general election Ward embarked on more official speaking tours overseas; she also toured camps for displaced persons in Palestine and Germany and attended the Nuremberg trials with her friend Thelma Cazalet-Keir. This work and her appointment as a Newcastle JP absorbed some of her prodigious energy until she was adopted by the Conservatives as prospective parliamentary candidate for Tynemouth in 1946. She was returned to parliament in 1950. The 1950s and early 1960s saw Ward actively campaigning for women's economic rights, mainly through the Equal Pay Campaign Committee. She published an account of the Women's Transport Service, <span class="italic">F.A.N.Y. Invicta</span> (1955), and lobbied for an official history of the Special Operations Executive, an organization in which she had had many friends. She promoted the interests of nurses, service widows, pensioners, and others living on small incomes. Her 1954 private member's bill <span class="roman">Right of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards)</span> protected householders' rights. She was also active on behalf of the Carl Rosa touring opera. She became the longest serving woman MP, holding the Tynemouth seat until the February 1974 general election, when she stood down. Her contribution to political life was acknowledged in a series of awards: CBE (1929), DBE (1955), CH (1973), and a life peerage (1974).<br>
<br>Irene Ward lacked the personal ambition of many of her contemporaries. Her manner had always been direct and she never lacked courage, but in later life her understanding of the complexities of an issue was sometimes imperfect and her political judgement questionable. Her political style and willingness to harry governments, even to the extent of being excluded from the house for five days by the speaker in 1968, made her a popular but also, in the eyes of some commentators, a slightly odd national figure. The large hats, capacious handbags, and bold jewellery she favoured might appear to mirror her personality but her character was more complex. Some found her difficult to know but her kindness was remembered fondly by many. Although several men were attracted to her, she does not appear to have had any intimate relationships. She once remarked enigmatically  (Sleight, 107) that she would have liked to marry, though only if she could have married the man she wanted. An undated note in her papers records her belief that work and charity could compensate for the absence of love. The pivotal figures in her life were her mother and Sir Cecil Cochrane. Outside politics her great interest was travelling. Domestic bases were a flat in Gosforth, shared with her mother until the latter's death in 1944, Thelma Cazalet-Keir's house in Eaton Place, the Ladies' Carlton Club, and the Sloane Club in London, but her natural habitat was the houses of parliament. She died on 26 April 1980 in the Knaresborough Nursing Home, 7 Knaresborough Place, Kensington, London, following a fall. She was cremated and her ashes were transported by a fishing boat from her old constituency and scattered in the North Sea.<br>
