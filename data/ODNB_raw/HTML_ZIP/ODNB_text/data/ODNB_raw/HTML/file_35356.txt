<span class="headword">Paget, Dame  (Mary) Rosalind</span>  (1855&#150;1948), <span class="occ">nurse and midwife</span>, was born on 4 January 1855 at Greenbank, Liverpool, in the home of her grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23161/', "William Rathbone (1787&#150;1868)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23160/', "Rathbone, William (1757&#150;1809)")</script>], whose daughter Elizabeth married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21116/', "John Paget (1811&#150;1898)")</script>, a London police magistrate, author, and an ardent whig, who had joined the Reform Club on its foundation. On her maternal side she came from a long line of social reformers, including her uncle William Rathbone (1819&#150;1902), MP for Liverpool, who had a lifelong interest in nursing reform and played a leading role in the formation of the Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses (QVJIN). His daughter Eleanor Rathbone, who maintained close contact with her cousin Rosalind, took an interest in social questions and women's suffrage.<br>
<br>As a young woman Rosalind Paget was influenced by this family commitment to social reform and public service and, like many educated, middle-class women of her day, she sought to lead a &#145;purposeful&#146; life. When her desire to study as an artist was opposed by her family, she entered the Westminster Hospital at the age of twenty, to train as a nurse, and there, under the Nightingale disciple Miss Luckes, she obtained her nursing certificate. She went later to the London Hospital (1882&#150;4), before training as a midwife at Endell Street Lying-in Hospital, gaining the diploma of the London Obstetrical Society in January 1885. Although Rosalind Paget returned to the London Hospital, where she worked for some years, her main interest lay in the reform of midwifery. In 1886 she was taken by Miss Freeman, matron at the British Lying-in Hospital, to her first meeting of the Matron's Aid Society, soon to be renamed the Midwives' Institute (later the Royal College of Midwives). She recalled that &#145;There were only about ten persons present and it was very dull&#146;. She agreed to join only if there was a &#145;Midwives Club and lectures and a library &hellip; Next day I was asked to help them organise one&#146;  (Cowell and Wainwright, 17).<br>
<br>From then on Rosalind Paget's energetic leadership helped to turn a small society with limited aims into a centre of midwifery reform. At that time the word midwife was hardly mentioned in polite society and the majority of midwives received little or no training. Rosalind, and the other middle-class leaders of the institute, helped to give respectability to midwifery and sought to obtain better education and training for midwives. They hoped to raise the status of midwifery as an area of women's work, to instil a sense of professionalism and public service into midwives, and at the same time to improve the conditions under which working-class women gave birth. Rosalind Paget held the post of treasurer from 1890 to 1930 and used her wide circle of social and professional connections to push forward the cause of midwifery reform and to give financial support to the institute. She also took rooms so that the institute would have a permanent headquarters for meetings, a club, and a library, and she organized lectures on midwifery by some of the most prestigious medical names of the day. In 1887 she founded the institute's journal, <span class="italic">Nursing Notes</span> (later <span class="italic">Midwives' Chronicle</span>), and, with Emma Brierly, edited it for many decades. She was also one of the founders of what later became the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Rosalind Paget played an active role in the campaign for midwife registration, giving evidence in 1892 to the select committee on midwifery. A bill for the registration of midwives was introduced into the House of Commons in 1890, but although England in this respect lagged behind most other European countries, the measure was continually rejected, mainly because it was considered an unnecessary restriction of individual liberty. In some quarters the advent of trained midwives was felt to be an encroachment not only upon the friendly services of neighbours but also upon the medical profession. Rosalind Paget knew that poor women could not in any case afford medical attention and insisted that it was wholly advantageous for the midwife to be trained and supervised. Finally in 1902 the <span class="roman">Midwives Act</span> provided for the registration of midwives, made it an offence for anyone not properly certificated to describe herself, or practise, as a midwife, and established the Central Midwives' Board. Rosalind Paget was a member of the board from 1902 to 1924 as a representative of the QVJIN, which had been established to promote district nursing and midwifery services throughout the country. She had a long association with the QVJIN; in 1890 she was appointed as its first chief officer and, although she resigned from this position in 1891, she continued as a member of the council, with special responsibility for midwifery.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Midwives Act</span>, coupled with a growing interest by policy makers in the health and welfare of babies, meant an increased workload for Rosalind Paget. She frequently represented the institute at official enquiries and conferences and acted as an effective lobbyist on behalf of midwives whenever proposals for legislation&#151;such as the 1911 <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span>&#151;appeared to affect their position. She also sought to maintain the importance of the independent midwife, although this became increasingly difficult in the inter-war years, when midwives' earnings were too low to attract well-qualified recruits.<br>
<br>Rosalind Paget always had a close personal and intellectual relationship with the contemporary women's movement and helped to maintain links between the institute and groups such as the Women's Liberal Federation and the National Union of Women Workers, often giving papers at their conferences. She was a strong supporter of women's suffrage and urged all members of the institute to take part in suffrage demonstrations; in July 1908 she led twenty members in a suffrage procession under the banner of Florence Nightingale. Rosalind Paget believed that women's lack of a vote meant that they were unable to influence policy making and saw the suffrage as the first step in enabling women to &#145;help forward social, moral and economic reforms&#146;, in particular those relating to &#145;the healthy upbringing and proper education of the children whose care is admittedly their special sphere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nursing Notes</span>, July 1908).<br>
<br>Rosalind Paget's effectiveness in a variety of activities, and the respect that she gained from members of the institute, was not simply the result of her political acumen, it was also helped by her wit and sense of humour; she even managed to present the annual budget in a lively and humorous way.<br>
<br>Rosalind Paget never married and throughout her professional life she devoted herself entirely to the work she took in hand; no detail of a midwife's life or work was too trivial for her interest and she was seen as the friend of all. She refused all recognition of her services until in 1935 she was appointed DBE. She found relaxation in music and art, tastes inherited from her father, and died at the age of ninety-three, on 19 August 1948, at her home, Colwood Park, Bolney, Sussex.<br>
