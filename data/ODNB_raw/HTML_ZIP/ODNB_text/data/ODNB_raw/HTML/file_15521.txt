<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kiffin,  William</span>  (1616&#150;1701), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and author</span>, was born in London of unknown parents, both of whom died in 1625 during an outbreak of plague. His surname is Welsh, an indication that his ancestors originally hailed from Wales. David Honeyman claims the family came from Conwy and that Kiffin was &#145;certainly&#146; a cousin of the Quaker Ellis Hookes  (Honeyman, 46). Four years after the death of his parents Kiffin was apprenticed, probably to a glover. There seems to be no truth in the common assertion that he served as an apprentice to John Lilburne, later an agitator for radical Leveller concerns, though Kiffin and Lilburne were friends in later years. In 1631, depressed about his future prospects as a glover, Kiffin decided to run away from his master. He happened by St Antholin's Church, where the puritan Thomas Foxley was preaching that day on &#145;the duty of servants to masters&#146;. Seeing a crowd of people going into the church, Kiffin decided to join them and became convinced that Foxley's sermon was intentionally aimed at him. He decided to go back to his master with the resolve to hear regularly &#145;some of them they called Puritan Ministers&#146;  (Orme, 3).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Over the next couple of years Kiffin heard a number of well-known preachers of the day, including John Davenport, Lewis Du Moulin, and the Arminian puritan John Goodwin. Their preaching not only gave him a firm grounding in the central themes of puritan theology and spirituality, but also helped him realize that &#145;God has not tied himself to any one way of converting a sinner&#146;  (Orme, 11). This later freed him from being tied to one particular method of evangelistic preaching.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1631 Kiffin joined a small group of fellow apprentices, who were in the habit of meeting together in the early morning for prayer, scripture reading, and mutual encouragement. This experience helped in the preparation of Kiffin as the theological and spiritual guide of a Particular Baptist conventicle. Like most of the early Particular Baptist leaders, Kiffin had no formal theological education. He became skilled in the knowledge and use of the scriptures as he first listened regularly to various preachers, then shared with others its impact on his life, and finally preached himself. In 1638 he married Hanna (1615&#150;1682), with whom he had a number of children.<h2>
<a name="JoiningtheBaptists"></a>Joining the Baptists</h2>By 1638 Kiffin had come to reject Anglican arguments for the idea of a state church and had joined what he termed an &#145;Independent congregation&#146; in London  (Orme, 14). When Kiffin joined this congregation, later known as Devonshire Square Baptist Church, it was without a pastor. At one time it had been led by a Samuel Eaton, who was now in prison, where he died the following year. Kiffin accepted an invitation to preach to the congregation, and at some point over the course of the next three or four years was chosen as their pastor. The preface of the second edition of John Lilburne's <span class="italic">The Christian Mans Triall</span> (1641), signed W. K., has been attributed to Kiffin.<br>
<br>During this entire period Kiffin continued to study the <span class="roman">Bible</span> for direction with regard to the constitution and form of a local church. When, over forty years later, he recalled this period of his life, what stuck out in his memory was his diligent examination of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to find the &#145;right way of worship&#146;  (Kiffin, <span class="italic">Sober Discourse</span>, 2). By the autumn of 1642 he, as well as the congregation, had come to a decidedly Baptist position. As he wrote,<blockquote>After some time [I] concluded that the safest way was to follow the footsteps of the flock (namely that order laid down by Christ and His Apostles, and practised by the primitive Christians in their times) which I found to be that after conversion they were baptised, added to the church, and continued in the apostles' doctrine, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer; according to which I thought myself bound to be conformable. (ibid.)</blockquote>His commitment to the Particular Baptist cause appears to have been sealed by a public debate with the Anglican apologist Daniel Featley held in Southwark on 17 October 1642.<br>
<br>Two years later Kiffin was a signatory for his church, along with the leadership of six other London congregations, of the first London confession of faith. This confession sought to demonstrate the solidarity of the Particular Baptists with the Calvinistic community throughout western and parts of central Europe. In addition, the first London confession spelt out in some detail a Baptist ecclesiology. Kiffin also appears to have played a significant role in drafting the document. The confession would serve as the theological basis for the Particular Baptists during their rapid advance in the late 1640s and the 1650s&#151;it was reprinted a number of times during this period&#151;and then throughout the years of persecution in the 1660s and 1670s after the Restoration. It was replaced only towards the end of the 1670s, by the second London confession of faith, adopted in 1689.<br>
<br>During the late 1640s and 1650s Kiffin emerged as a skilled spokesman for the fledgeling Baptist movement. A number of texts record public debates, either proposed or actual, with a variety of figures. On 3 December 1645 Kiffin, along with his co-religionists Benjamin Cox and Hanserd Knollys, was supposed to have debated with the London presbyterian Edmund Calamy the elder at his Aldermanbury home on the nature and subjects of baptism. The debate was, however, cancelled by the lord mayor, Thomas Adams, owing to rumours that the Baptists were intending to bring &#145;Swords, Clubs, and Staves&#146; with them in order to slay Calamy  (Coxe, Knollys, and Kiffin, 4&#150;6). The previous year, the Dutch Calvinist minister Cesar Calandrini had debated with Kiffin in an attempt to prevent members of his Dutch congregation, then meeting in Austin Friars, London, from joining the Baptists. In 1646 Kiffin and Knollys were involved in a public debate in Coventry with two paedobaptists, John Bryan and Obadiah Grew. Kiffin was a signatory to the dedication in <span class="italic">Walwins Wiles</span> (1649), an attack on the Levellers usually attributed to John Price. Another debate was in 1654 with the celebrated court physician Peter Chamberlen, a Seventh Day Baptist, over an aspect of church life (<span class="italic">Discourse between Cap. Kiffin, and Dr Chamberlain, about Imposition of Hands</span>). Hostile witnesses from this period also point to Kiffin's leadership among the Baptists. The presbyterian merchant Joshua Ricraft attacked him as &#145;the grand ringleader&#146; of the Baptists, while an anonymous publication in 1659 described him as the &#145;ordained Mufty of all Hereticks and Sectaries&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life and Approaching Death of William Kiffin</span>, 2).<br>
<br>Kiffin also played a prominent role in the expansion of the movement beyond London. Extant documents from places as far afield as Wales and Northumberland, Ireland and the Midlands reveal Kiffin's involvement in planning the establishment of new churches and associations, then in giving them advice and counsel, and generally in providing stability to the Baptist cause during these early days of the movement. One critical moment came in May 1658, when, at the meeting of the western association of Baptist churches in Dorchester, some individuals who were sympathetic to the potentially subversive politics of the Fifth Monarchy movement sought to convince the representatives of the churches in the association to espouse publicly the ideals and goals of this party. Kiffin, who was present with other representatives from the churches in London, successfully persuaded the western association not to commit itself in this direction. While some of the Fifth Monarchy movement appear to have been relatively harmless students of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, others had definite revolutionary tendencies and were convinced that they should take an active, even violent, role in the fulfilment of the prophecies of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> 2. Open and widespread adherence to these views by the Particular Baptists would have had harmful and serious repercussions for the Baptist movement.<h2>
<a name="Londonmerchantandcivicfigure"></a>London merchant and civic figure</h2>During these years, which also witnessed the upheaval of the English civil war and the establishment of the Commonwealth, Kiffin was extensively engaged as a merchant. He had in 1638 become a freeman of the Leathersellers' Company of London, which enjoyed a monopoly on the leather trade in the capital. His decision about 1645 to take a member of his church as a partner for a trading venture in the Netherlands turned out to be the launching of an enormously successful business. In Kiffin's own words: &#145;it pleased God so to bless our endeavours, that, from scores of pounds, he brought it to many hundreds and thousands of pounds: giving me more of this world than ever I could have thought to have enjoyed&#146;  (Orme, 23). In his later years it appears that the focus of Kiffin's ventures was the cloth trade.<br>
<br>Kiffin's business ventures also led to his involvement in the civic and political affairs of the capital. In 1642, along with other individual Londoners, Kiffin contributed horse and riders for the parliamentary cause. Documents from the late 1650s speak of Kiffin as a &#145;captain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discourse between Cap. Kiffin, and Dr Chamberlain</span>) and &#145;lieutenant-colonel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Approaching Death of William Kiffin</span>, 5) in the London militia. In Oliver Cromwell's last parliament of 1656&#150;8 Kiffin sat as a member for Middlesex and was on good terms with Cromwell. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, however, his involvement in political and civic matters was understandably curtailed.<br>
<br>In February 1660, shortly before the Restoration, Kiffin's house, along with those of several others, was raided by order of General George Monck. Kiffin was arrested and some arms&#151;&#145;2 Drums &hellip; 5 Old Pikes, and 6 Swords&#146;&#151;seized  (Kiffin and others). Though he was soon released&#151;as a result of a letter he wrote to the lord mayor&#151;he had experienced a foretaste of what the next twenty-eight years were to bring for dissenters in general. Over the next three years he was re-arrested three times, though his stays in prison were brief.<br>
<br>On a number of occasions Kiffin used his position and wealth to intervene on behalf of fellow dissenters. In 1664 he was able to rescue twelve General Baptists from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who had been sentenced to death under an Elizabethan law for participation in an illegal conventicle; he went directly to Charles II and obtained a reprieve for them all. In the following decade Kiffin also used his influence at court to clear some New England Baptists from the false charge of murdering a Boston minister.<br>
<br>A quaint account of Kiffin's influential relationship with the king is found in a story related by the eighteenth-century Baptist historian Thomas Crosby. The king had supposedly asked Kiffin for a loan of &pound;40,000. Kiffin was aware that if he gave the king such a loan there was every likelihood that it would never be repaid, and thus offered to make the king a gift of &pound;10,000, which the king gladly accepted. Afterwards, according to Crosby, Kiffin jocosely remarked that he had thereby saved himself &pound;30,000. This story may well be a recollection of an incident in the summer of 1670, when a financially burdened monarch approached the magistracy of London for a loan of &pound;60,000. The response on the part of the aldermen was half-hearted, raising only a third of the needed loan. Seeing an opportunity to drive a wedge between the king and parliament, London dissenters organized the raising of the remaining two-thirds of the requested loan; Kiffin, who subscribed &pound;3600, was the largest of the contributors.<br>
<br>In 1670 Kiffin was elected sheriff of London and Middlesex, though he was subsequently rejected because of his nonconformity. In recognition of this, in the following year he was elected master of the leathersellers, though he was only a liveryman of the company at this time.<h2>
<a name="ArdentBaptist"></a>Ardent Baptist</h2>When a declaration of indulgence was issued on 15 March 1672, Kiffin secured a licence for himself to preach. Although this declaration was withdrawn the following March, there seems to have been liberty enough in London in the years immediately following for Kiffin to participate in major public debates with the Quakers regarding the divinity of Christ, on 28 August and 9 October 1674 at the Barbican meeting-house, and on 16 October at the Quakers' meeting-house in Spitalfields. The second meeting lasted until dark, while so many attended the final meeting that there were fears that the gallery would collapse.<br>
<br>In October 1676 Kiffin and four other London Baptist leaders travelled to the west country to confront the Baptist evangelist Thomas Collier. Originally a member of Kiffin's church in London, Collier became the leading Particular Baptist evangelist in south-west England during the 1650s. In 1674, however, Collier published <span class="italic">A Body of Divinity</span>, in which he denied original sin, argued that Christ died for all men, and maintained that Christ's humanity was eternal. Collier's important standing within the Particular Baptist community made it imperative that his views be dealt with. A meeting was accordingly arranged between Collier and Kiffin and the other Baptist pastors from London. At the meeting Kiffin took the lead in urging Collier to renounce views the Baptist leader clearly regarded as heretical. Collier refused to do so, and Kiffin and the London Baptist leadership subsequently refused all association with him. When Nehemiah Cox published his rebuttal of Collier, <span class="italic">Vindicia veritatis</span>, in the following year, Kiffin signed a brief explanatory statement as to why the work was necessary.<br>
<br>During these years Kiffin was also embroiled in another controversy, this time with the quintessential puritan John Bunyan, over the necessity of believer's baptism. Bunyan's <span class="italic">A Confession of my Faith, and a Reason of my Practice</span> (1672) and <span class="italic">Differences in Judgment about Water-Baptism, No Bar to Communion</span> (1673) had rejected the standard Particular Baptist argument that believer's baptism must precede membership in the local church or any of the privileges of that membership: in particular, participation in the Lord's supper. While there were other written responses to Bunyan, Kiffin's <span class="italic">A Sober Discourse of Right to Church-Communion</span> (1681) was the most noteworthy advocacy of the closed membership position in this controversy. Kiffin built his case on the regulative principle of scripture, various key scripture texts, examples from the patristic era, and logical reasoning.<br>
<br>The years following the publication of this major work by Kiffin were difficult ones for him personally. His wife, Hanna, died on 6 October 1682. Their two eldest living sons had predeceased her: William, the eldest, had died on 31 August 1669, aged twenty; the other son had died in Venice, Kiffin believing he had been poisoned by a Roman Catholic priest. A daughter, Priscilla, died on 15 March 1679, aged twenty-four. In October 1684 Kiffin was again arrested, this time in the aftermath of the Rye House plot when various London radicals were incarcerated. One of his sons-in-law, Joseph Hayes, a banker, narrowly escaped being executed after being wrongly implicated in this plot. One of the sharpest blows was yet to come, though, what Kiffin called &#145;no small affliction&#146;  (Orme, 54). Two of his grandsons, William and Benjamin Hewling, were executed in September 1685 for their part in the rebellion of the duke of Monmouth&#151;William at Lyme on 12 September and Benjamin at Taunton on 30 September. Kiffin unsuccessfully sought to obtain their freedom by offering &pound;3000 for their acquittal. In his words, &#145;We missed the right door; for the Lord Chief Justice [George Jeffreys] finding agreements were made with others and so little to himself, was the more provoked to use all manner of cruelty to the poor prisoners: so that few escaped&#146;  (ibid., 54). At the sentencing of William, Jeffreys told him that &#145;his grandfather did as well deserve that death, which he was likely to suffer, as he did&#146;  (ibid., 82).<br>
<br>Two years later, in August 1687, James II, as part of an attempt to undermine the power base of the Anglican establishment, informed Kiffin of his intention that Kiffin serve as an alderman of the City of London. Kiffin sought to avoid this appointment, pleading his age, his retirement from active involvement in business and politics, and the deaths of his grandsons: &#145;a wound to my heart&#146;, Kiffin told the king, &#145;which is still bleeding, and never will close, but in the grave&#146;  (Orme, 159). But at length Kiffin had no choice but to serve as an alderman from October 1687 to October of the following year. By the conclusion of his time in office, though, James's regime had but a few weeks left to run before it crumbled in the revolution of 1688 and a new era dawned for all dissenters like Kiffin.<h2>
<a name="Finaldaysandsignificance"></a>Final days and significance</h2>William III's authorization of the <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span> in 1689 provided Kiffin, along with other Baptist leaders in London, with the opportunity to issue a call in July 1689 for a national assembly of Particular Baptists, the first of its kind. Representatives from over one hundred churches gathered. Among other things, they approved the adoption of the second London confession of faith, originally drawn up in 1677 by William Collins and Nehemiah Cox, co-pastors of the Petty France Church in London. The unity experienced at this assembly was short-lived. In the 1690s the London Baptist community was rent by controversy over the singing of hymns. Kiffin, ever the debater, found himself drawn into the controversy, in which he opposed the singing of hymns in favour of singing psalms only.<br>
<br>Kiffin continued to be active in his pastorate at Devonshire Square during his final years, though he had the help of assistants. Thomas Patient had been his first co-elder. Three years after Patient's death in 1666, Daniel Dyke had been appointed. He served until his death in 1688, when Richard Adams, who succeeded Kiffin as pastor when the latter died in 1701, was ordained co-elder.<br>
<br>By the 1690s Kiffin had remarried. His second wife, Sarah, ran foul of the Devonshire Square Church; on 2 March 1698 she was charged with a number of misdeeds by the church. Upon examination she was found guilty of, among other things, defrauding her husband of &pound;200 and making false accusations about him. When she refused to appear before the church, Sarah was suspended from communion on 24 April. To add sorrow upon sorrow, a third son, Harry, passed away on 8 December 1698. Although these events must have caused Kiffin deep anguish, he does not appear to have wavered in his commitment to the Christian faith. As he had written in 1693 at the conclusion of his autobiography: &#145;God is, by his providence, shaking the earth under our feet. There is no sure foundation of rest and peace but only in Jesus Christ&#146;  (Orme, 90). He died in London on 29 December 1701 and was buried in Bunhill Fields. In his will, dated 23 March 1700, he asked to be buried alongside his first wife and children. He also noted that he had previously paid an annuity to his second wife but this was now the responsibility of his grandson William Kiffin. He named another grandson, Joseph Kiffin, as executor, but evidently the will was contested, as it was not proved until 14 March 1716.<br>
<br>Since the 1640s Kiffin had been a source of strength and stability to the Particular Baptist movement, and played a vital role in its growth and advance. It was during his years of leadership of the movement that those positions distinctive of the Particular Baptists were hammered out, and Kiffin played no small part in the determination of the future identity of this Christian tradition.<br>
