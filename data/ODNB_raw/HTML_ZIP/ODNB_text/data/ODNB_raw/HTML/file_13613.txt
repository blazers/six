<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holt,  Joseph</span>  (1756<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was born in Ballydonnell, co. Wicklow, the second eldest of six children of John and Mary, of a Church of Ireland farming family of English ancestry. His tombstone records his date of birth as 1756, yet he was baptized in Castlemacadam in July 1759 close to Ballymoneen, where the family moved in the 1780s. His brothers, William, Thomas, and Jonathan, joined him in the ranks of the republican United Irishmen in 1797. When a youth Joseph Holt worked in Bray as a gardener for a magistrate named Sweeney and later received agricultural training in the north of Ireland. From his earliest days Holt professed an interest in military affairs and he was briefly a member of the 32nd foot until recalled home by his parents about 1779. He then joined a patriotic &#145;volunteer&#146; unit raised in Arklow.<br>
<br>Holt's marriage to the widowed Hester Long in 1782 occasioned a shift to her small but well-appointed farm at Mullinaveigue (Roundwood). He gained work as a wood ranger, bailiff, and billet master; his most important appointment was as deputy aulnager, or cloth assessor, in a county undergoing a massive textile boom. Attendance at fairs and travel throughout adjacent counties gave Holt a reputedly unrivalled knowledge of regional geography which he put to good use during the 1798 rising. He served as a baronial constable, primarily in his native Ballinacor North district, but also in Dublin in the early 1790s. In August 1794 he captured the notorious gaolbreaker Patrick Rogers and his fame as a zealous &#145;thief taker&#146; was soon unsurpassed in the province of Leinster.<br>
<br>The Holts were heavily engaged in the building industry and Joseph Holt procured several grand jury contracts in the 1790s for road maintenance and bridge building near Roundwood. Financial irregularities embroiled him in disputes with county officials which proved dangerous when Wicklow society became disturbed by political ferment. Contrary to the false impression given in his disingenuous memoirs, Holt was an early, willing, and prominent United Irishman and an elected captain prior to the close of 1797. He may well have come to resent the prevailing barriers to social and commercial advancement. Wicklow activists like Holt succeeded in disaffecting &#145;protestant, catholic and dissenter&#146; in an area that boasted the largest, rural non-Catholic population outside Ulster. He evidently used his cover as a cloth assessor to recruit in the Wicklow mountains and liaise with city-based committees that later supplied his forces with munitions. Information regarding his activities reached the authorities in early May 1798 and Holt became an armed fugitive in the mountains after his farm was burnt on 10 May.<br>
<br>Holt's first known act as a rebel commander took place on 29 May 1798 when he led 300 men to burn the home of loyalist magistrate Thomas Hugo. They were dispersed by cavalry and did not reform in time to participate in the failed attempt to capture Newtownmountkennedy the following day. This check stalled the rising in the north of the county and Holt was one of several Wicklow militants who ventured south into Wexford to avail of more propitious circumstances. His men were supplied by the commissary of the forces that attacked New Ross on 5 June but evidently did not participate in that mismanaged assault. Holt returned to his native county to await the breakthrough at Arklow on 9 June and, when this failed to materialize, launched a highly destructive attack on loyalist properties around Roundwood on the 14th.<br>
<br>Mountain skirmishes with yeomanry and Reay Highlanders ensued for several days in which both sides enjoyed minor victories of little strategic consequence. Holt's flair for guerrilla-style fighting consolidated his position as the principal leader of insurgent forces in north Wicklow. They joined the more substantial forces from south Wicklow and north Wexford on 24 June and attacked Hacketstown on the 25th. Holt's horse was shot under him in the course of this pyrrhic victory. Much greater success was enjoyed on 30 June, however, when Holt laid a highly effective ambush at Ballyellis in which a large cavalry patrol sustained forty-nine fatalities.<br>
<br>Holt fought again on 2 July at Ballyrahan Hill, co. Wicklow, where nineteen yeomen officers and men were killed, after which he withdrew his faction to the north of the county. This evinced Holt's independent frame of mind and stemmed from his opposition to campaigning once more in Wexford, where terrain, logistics, and enemy strength militated against the insurgents' success. His judgement was soon vindicated and from 5 July harried parties of insurgents made their way towards his camp at Whelp Rock above Blessington. By then the vast majority of active insurgents were availing themselves of a liberal amnesty offered by the newly instated viceroy, Lord Cornwallis. A much diminished hard core of about 4000 relocated to the remote Wicklow mountains.<br>
<br>It was with great reluctance that Holt agreed on 8 July to accompany an expedition from the mountains into the exposed lowlands of Kildare and co. Meath. Insurgent commanders hoped to reignite the virtually dormant rising in the midlands and locate other small fugitive bodies presumed to be hiding there ahead of an attempt on Dublin. A costly repulse at Clonard on 11 July and assault on the camp at Rynville Hill on the 12th put paid to this gambit. Holt singularly distinguished himself by organizing a rear guard action, in which he sustained two minor wounds to his head and arm. Left for dead by the rump mainforce that was defeated at Knightstown on 14 July, he was guided through Dublin city to Wicklow by United Irish sympathizers.<br>
<br>Following the midlands d&eacute;b&acirc;cle Holt was the only leader of note willing to fight on. From mid-July he led up to 2000 men in one of the first guerrilla campaigns in Europe and held off vastly superior forces until November. His tactical skill and innovation during this period were remarkable and he took pains to discipline his irregulars to the greatest degree possible. They burnt over 400 loyalist-owned houses and premises to punish local enemies and to deny the army the use of strategic stone buildings. While attrition, factionalism, and the amnesty steadily sapped Holt's ranks, the critical mass necessary for meaningful resistance was sustained by their ideological commitment and expectation of French military assistance. Losses were compensated for by 150 or so militia and army defectors who rallied to Holt in the autumn of 1798.<br>
<br>A major upsurge of fighting in Wicklow in late August coincided with French army landings in Mayo but continued long after their surrender on 8 September. Fatal clashes occurred near Coolgreany, Clone Hill, Mucklagh Hill, Blessington, Greenan, Keadeen, and Glenmalure. In a rare feat Holt's men captured the defended town of Aughrim on 19 September and occupied it overnight. Their depredations and the political instability they engendered troubled a government that was keen to usher in the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> while presenting a confident face to the French. Illness, wounds, and the prospect of a difficult winter campaign with a price on his head clearly disposed Holt to contemplate capitulation in October 1798. He ultimately accepted a deal brokered by the La Touche family of Delgany after Dublin United Irish leaders informed him that there was no prospect of further French aid. On 10 November 1798 he surrendered to Lord Powerscourt on the understanding that his life would be spared, a concession that outraged many Irish conservatives.<br>
<br>When held in Dublin Castle Holt made statements implicating associates who had engaged in brigandage but refused offers to act against fellow United Irishmen. He was consequently obliged to finance his family's passage to New South Wales on the convict ship <i>Minerva</i>. His infant daughter, Marianne, was left in the care of Ann La Touche's school and a second son, Joseph Harrison, was born on board the transport in early 1799. Much to the concern of the colonial authorities, Holt arrived in Sydney as a free man in January 1800. He accepted work as an overseer on Captain William Cox's Brush Farm and evidently enjoyed his considerable status in the sizeable community of Irish political prisoners. Hester Holt, meanwhile, obtained a land grant of 100 acres in her own name and this property was subsequently increased by a number of purchases and exchanges.<br>
<br>Holt frequently ran foul of the colonial administration and was strongly suspected of involvement in the rebellious &#145;Irish plots&#146; of September and October 1800 which were nipped in the bud. Cox's influence and a short hunger strike in Sydney gaol, however, enabled him to escape severe punishment. Holt was also cleared in December 1803 of plotting to kill Judge-Advocate Richard Atkins but soon afterwards entered into the planning stages of the Castle Hill revolt. On being warned of betrayal Holt pulled out of the plot and fended off rebel efforts to conscript him at Brush Farm on the night of 4 March 1804. He was, nevertheless, deemed culpable and was banished to the feared penal outpost of Norfolk Island. Holt was allowed back to the mainland in March 1806 after a short stay on Van Diemen's Land and from that point his avoidance of sedition paved the way for success as a colonist.<br>
<br>Holt received an absolute pardon in January 1811 and upon settling his affairs he and his family took passage home on the <i>Isabella</i>. The ship was wrecked in the Falkland Islands in February 1813 and its passengers marooned until rescued by an American ship, <i>Nannina</i>, on 4 April. The ship was almost immediately made a prize of by HMS <i>Nancy</i> and it was not until February 1814 that the Holts reached Liverpool, arriving in Dublin on 5 April. Resettlement in Wicklow was out of the question in view of Holt's notoriety and he instead opened a pub in Kevin Street, Dublin. By 1819 police harassment and allegations from rivals that he was an informer became intolerable. Holt sold the business and moved to the coastal suburb of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where he apparently built several houses in York Street. He died there on 16 May 1826 and was buried in a family plot in Carrickbrennan cemetery, Monkstown. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Holt's manuscript autobiography passed from his friend Sir William Betham to the noted folklorist Thomas Crofton Croker, who edited it for publication in 1838. The work proved unpopular with nationalists, who were unaware that Croker had gentrified and censored Holt's narrative and, most seriously, interpolated passages which portrayed its ostensible author as a loyalist apologist. This badly damaged Holt's reputation and that of the Wicklow theatre of the 1798 rising until the 1980s, when his historical importance was reassessed.<br>
