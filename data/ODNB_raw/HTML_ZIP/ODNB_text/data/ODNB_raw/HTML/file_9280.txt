<span class="headword">Fenn,  Humphrey</span>  (1543/4&#150;1634), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, matriculated as a sizar from Queens' College, Cambridge, on 12 November 1568, and graduated BA in 1573. Nothing is known of his background, which was probably comparatively humble. Having moved to Peterhouse, he proceeded MA in 1576 and began his ministry in Northampton in the same year, immediately establishing a nonconformist reputation. He was imprisoned and, although the inhabitants petitioned the queen on his behalf attesting to the quality of his preaching, it seems that he did not return to the town on his release.<br>
<br>On 21 February 1578 Fenn succeeded Anthony Fletcher as vicar of Holy Trinity, Coventry. By this time he was married, a daughter being baptized at Holy Trinity in July 1578; nothing certain is known of his wife. In Coventry he became associated with Thomas Cartwright (1535&#150;1603) and the growing presbyterian movement. A classis was established in Warwickshire around 1583, headed by Cartwright and Fenn, both of whom enjoyed the patronage of the earl of Leicester. At the request of the London puritans he accompanied the earl to represent their grievances to the queen. When Whitgift's three articles were issued in 1583 he refused to subscribe and was suspended. An account of his examination from a manuscript of Roger Morrice (<i>c</i>.1628&#150;1702) was included by Benjamin Brook in his <span class="italic">Lives of the Puritans</span> (1831). Fenn was replaced in Coventry by a Welshman called Griffen, but was restored to his vicarage shortly after 14 July 1585 through the intercession of Leicester. In the same year he accompanied the earl to the Netherlands as a chaplain.<br>
<br>In 1590 Fenn was again suspended, as a result of his active participation in the Warwickshire classis and his support for the puritan <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, to which he, Cartwright, and ten other ministers in the county had subscribed in 1588. He was committed to the Fleet prison and, refusing to take the oath <i>ex officio</i>, was imprisoned for contempt and deprived of his living. His successor, Richard Eaton, was instituted on 12 January 1591. In May that year the attorney-general exhibited a bill against Cartwright, Fenn, and seven others in Star Chamber, and on 13 May they made their first appearance before the court. The defendants denied that in their &#145;associations&#146; they exercised any jurisdiction or meddled with sedition&#151;a defence which Fenn steadfastly maintained. They were remanded without bail, although James VI of Scotland interceded (12 June) for their release. By December 1591 the case against them had reached stalemate and they petitioned for their release on bail. A further petition in April 1592 was successful. By the autumn Fenn had returned to Warwickshire and was petitioning to be allowed to preach.<br>
<br>It is not certain that Fenn and his co-defendants were ever completely cleared of the charges against them and the extent to which he was subsequently able to resume his ministry is unclear. He was not restored to the vicarage of Holy Trinity, but Julines Herring (1582&#150;1644) studied divinity with Fenn after leaving Cambridge and he appeared on one list of proposed representatives for the 1604 Hampton Court conference. The Humphrey Fenn appointed to the Sunday lectureship at St John the Baptist, Bablake, Coventry, on 24 April 1624 was his son, an Oxford MA born in 1582. In 1626 or soon after &#145;old Mr. Fenn&#146; joined with the mayor and leading citizens in inviting Samuel Clarke (1599&#150;1683), the martyrologist, to become a lecturer at Coventry  (<span class="italic">Lives</span>, 5&#150;6).<br>
<br>Fenn's will, written in 1631 when he was eighty-seven and had been a preacher for fifty-five years, was prefaced by a profession of his faith declaring that the Church of England maintained &#145;a shameful schism against all the reformed churches of the gospel&#146; and endorsing a presbyterian system of governance for the church. He died in Coventry early in 1634 and was buried there on 8 February in Holy Trinity churchyard. A fortnight later Archbishop William Laud received from the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield a copy of the controversial preface, which also circulated in manuscript among the godly before its publication as <span class="italic">The Last Will and Testament with the Profession of Faith of Humphrey Fenn</span> (1641). Fenn's wife apparently predeceased him; she may be the Anne Fenn buried at Holy Trinity on 27 January 1631. His probate inventory shows that he died a comparatively wealthy man.<br>
