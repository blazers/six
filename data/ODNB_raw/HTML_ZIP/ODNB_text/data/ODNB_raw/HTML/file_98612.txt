<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richardson,  Ian William</span>  (1934&#150;2007), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 7 April 1934 at 21 Duff Street, Edinburgh, the only son and eldest of three children of John Richardson (1909&#150;1990), a manager at the McVitie and Price biscuit factory, and his wife, Margaret Pollock (Peggy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drummond (1910&#150;1988). His parents had met at the McVitie factory, where, Richardson claimed, his father invented the Jaffa cake.<br>
<br>Richardson was educated at Balgreen primary school and Heriot's and Tynecastle high schools, all in Edinburgh. He felt he was &#145;a hopeless student&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 6 Dec 1997) but showed some aptitude in art and piano playing, and his dramatic leanings manifested themselves early, when he was chosen to read Laurence Binyon's &#145;For the Fallen&#146; at an armistice day service. &#145;It was my turn to say &#147;They shall not grow old as we that are left grow old&#148;: I did it without looking at the paper and in front of the altar, not at the lectern&#146;  (ibid., 1 Nov 1995). He made his first visit to the theatre at fourteen, and his first appearance as an aristocratic boy in an amateur production of <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span>. The director told him that he needed to modify his accent to progress, so his mother arranged elocution lessons. Thereafter he took on stage-management jobs with the Edinburgh People's Theatre and with the visiting Wilson Barrett Company. His three years of national service were spent mostly in Libya, and involved locating and retrieving remains for burial in the Tobruk war cemetery. He then became a duty announcer with the British Forces Broadcasting Service, working on classical music programmes and directing dramas. Influenced heavily by the clipped tones of the chief announcer, he learned to suppress his Scottish accent still further, and determined to become an actor.<br>
<br>On returning to Scotland Richardson entered the College of Dramatic Art in Glasgow, and concurrently studied for a teaching qualification at Glasgow University. His father, an austere Presbyterian, had strongly disapproved of his son's choice of profession, but was won round on seeing him perform at college, and thereafter was supportive. Richardson left college in 1957, having won the James Bridie gold medal, and the following year joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, under the actor and director Bernard Hepton. His roles included John Worthing in <span class="italic">The Importance of Being Earnest</span>, and the title role in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, directed by Hepton. Among those who admired his youthful Hamlet was the critic J. C. Trewin, who wrote that he entered as &#145;a slight, sad-eyed figure of settled melancholy, earnest, sweet and boyish, who could suggest heartbreak in an inflection, a twist of the lip&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 10 Feb 2007).<br>
<br>Richardson's performance was also seen by the Shakespearian scholar and director John Barton, who recommended him to Peter Hall, the newly appointed director of the Shakespeare festival in Stratford upon Avon. Richardson was offered a three-year contract, becoming one of the first in an ensemble that, a year later, was renamed the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). He stayed for fifteen years, fast becoming a cornerstone of the company. He gained attention even in minor roles. His somewhat inbred Prince of Aragon in Michael Langham's production of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (1960) was &#145;the last expiring flicker of an effete lineage&#151;preceded by his own portrait which had evidently adorned the Academy at Saragossa, and escorted by a matriarch of &#147;endless age&#148;&#146;  (Speaight, 278). The matriarch was played by the actress Maroussia Frank (<i>b</i>. 1940), whom Richardson married on 2 February 1961. Six years his junior, she was the daughter of Alexei Frank, a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;, and his wife, Elizabeth (Betty) Scorer, a dancer, and later ballet and theatre critic for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. They had two sons, Jeremy (<i>b</i>. 1961), later a graphic designer, and Miles (<i>b</i>. 1963), who was to become an actor.<br>
<br>Richardson's other early roles at Stratford included a glittering and devilish Oberon opposite Judi Dench's Titania (1961), and a wonderfully flamboyant Antipholus of Ephesus in Clifford Williams's hugely inventive, and much revived, <span class="italic">Comedy of Errors</span> (1964). He played Malatesti to Peggy Ashcroft's Duchess in the <span class="italic">Duchess of Malfi</span>, the RSC's first production at the Aldwych Theatre (1960), which thereafter became the company's London home, and in 1964 toured the eastern bloc and America as Edmund in the legendary Peter Brook&#150;Paul Scofield <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and played the Herald in Brook's equally ground-breaking production of Peter Weiss's <span class="italic">Marat / Sade</span>. In 1965 he made his New York d&eacute;but playing Marat in <span class="italic">Marat / Sade</span>, causing something of a sensation, in that he was the first actor to appear naked on the Broadway stage. He first played Ford in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> in 1964 and repeated the role for a number of years. As a suburban man driven to distraction by his own suspicions of cuckoldry, his was a great comic performance, &#145;a study of obsessional jealousy as frightening as it was funny&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 10 Feb 2007). In 1965 he gave what John Barton considered the definitive Chorus in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, followed by, among others, a dazzling Vendice in Trevor Nunn's reclamation of Tourneur's <span class="italic">The Revenger's Tragedy</span> (1965 and 1969), a neurotic and patrician Coriolanus (1966), an ice-cold Cassius in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> (1968), a wildly camp Proteus in <span class="italic">Two Gentlemen of Verona</span>, and a wonderfully despairing Prospero in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (both 1970).<br>
<br>In 1970 Richardson took time out from the RSC, and faced a year of unemployment when a television project was cancelled, and he and Maroussia were reduced to scouring Covent Garden for discarded fruit and vegetables. He was rescued by the Bristol Old Vic Theatre, and gave a touching performance as Tom Wrench, the sweet-natured playwright, in <span class="italic">Trelawny</span>, Julian Slade's and Aubrey Woods's musical version of Pinero's <span class="italic">Trelawny of the &#145;Wells&#146;</span>, which then transferred to Sadler's Wells (1971&#150;2). He returned to the RSC in 1973 to give one of his greatest performances, as Berowne in <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span>. Berowne remained his favourite role, exercising all his technical prowess. In John Barton's acclaimed production of <span class="italic">Richard II</span> (1974) he and Richard Pasco shared and alternated the roles of Richard and the usurper Henry Bolingbroke, Barton's intention being to show the King and Bolingbroke as mirror images. His Richard was (in Michael Billington's words) a performance of &#145;infinite sweetness, bruising irony and thunderous scorn&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 10 Feb 2007), in a production that redefined the play for years to come. Richardson's final roles with the company included Iachimo in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span> (1974), and the title role in <span class="italic">Richard III</span> (1975). His Richard, in a highly conceptualized production set in a psychiatric ward, resembled a grotesque child unrestrained by social customs.<br>
<br>In the Americas Richardson proved himself a consummate Shavian. In 1976, as Henry Higgins in the twentieth-anniversary Broadway revival of <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span>, he gave a dazzling performance of lightning speed and attack, winning the Drama Desk award and a Tony nomination, and the following year at the Shaw festival in Niagara on the Lake, Canada, he played Jack Tanner in <span class="italic">Man and Superman</span> and the Doctor in <span class="italic">The Millionairess</span>. In 1979 he returned to the British stage, on tour and at the Old Vic, as Mercutio, and, in another great comic performance, as Khlestakov, in Gorky's <span class="italic">Government Inspector</span>. Richardson was an astonishingly accomplished stage actor, combining physical grace, great energy, impeccable style, and quicksilver comic timing. As a man he was quite emotional and vulnerable, and often suffered sickness before going on stage. There was an inner turbulence that underscored his work. But it was his voice that finally marked him out. He was a masterful verse-speaker, of matchless clarity and dexterity, with formidable breath control. He seemed to take long speeches on one breath, his voice variously described as oboe-, trumpet-, and bell-like.<br>
<br>Richardson had made his television d&eacute;but in the early 1960s, repeating his performances in filmed RSC productions. In 1971 he played Anthony Beavis in Aldous Huxley's <span class="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</span>, and in 1979 Montgomery in <span class="italic">Churchill and the Generals</span> and <span class="italic">Ike: the War Years</span>. As Bill Haydon, the mole in MI6, in John le Carr&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</span> (1979) he gave a mesmerizing and mischievous performance. He later credited Sir Alec Guinness, the star of <span class="italic">Tinker, Tailor</span>, with teaching him to act for the camera. In 1981 he won the Royal Television Society's best actor award for his bravura performances as several characters&#151;a Scottish crook, a &#145;dodgy&#146; British agent, and a bungling Nazi officer&#151;in <span class="italic">Private Schulz</span>. Other television roles included impressive performances as Sherlock Holmes in <span class="italic">The Sign of Four</span> and <span class="italic">The Hound of the Baskervilles</span> (both 1983), Nehru in <span class="italic">Mountbatten: the Last Viceroy</span> (1986), Anthony Blunt in <span class="italic">Blunt</span> (1987), the Master in Tom Sharpe's <span class="italic">Porterhouse Blue</span> (1987), Sir Robert Morton in <span class="italic">The Winslow Boy</span> (1989), and the Falkland Islands' governor Sir Rex Hunt in <span class="italic">An Ungentlemanly Act</span> (1992).<br>
<br>As Francis Urquhart, the Conservative Party chief whip who will stop at nothing, including murder, to get to Downing Street, in Michael Dobbs's <span class="italic">House of Cards</span> (1990), Richardson found his defining role as a screen actor, and was every bit as accomplished as he was on stage. The critic James Wolcott wrote that:<blockquote>Like the late Sir Laurence Olivier, [Richardson] is a master of the raised eyebrow, and he carries his head as if it belonged on a coin. His nose gleams like a dagger. His narcissism is cut so fine that he seems to be peeling off a personal supply of thin smiles. (<span class="italic">New Yorker</span>, 17 Jan 1994)</blockquote>Richardson's Urquhart was a charming, sardonic, and wholly captivating creation, addressing the camera in direct asides he made the audience co-conspirators in his schemes, and coined a catchphrase (&#145;You might think that: I couldn't possibly comment&#146;) that resonated long afterwards and was quoted by Prime Minister John Major in the House of Commons. Richardson won awards from the British Film Academy and the Broadcasting Press Guild, and received further nominations for his work in the two sequels, <span class="italic">To Play the King</span> (1993) and <span class="italic">The Final Cut</span> (1995). Later parts included Lord Groan in <span class="italic">Gormenghast</span> (2000), and the voice of Death in Terry Pratchett's <span class="italic">Hogfather</span> (2006).<br>
<br>Although his television career brought him fame and reward, Richardson's cinema appearances were rare. Early roles included filmed versions of <span class="italic">Marat / Sade</span> (1967) and of Peter Hall's production of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1968). Other film work included the Priest alongside Peter O'Toole in <span class="italic">Man of La Mancha</span> (1972), an incisive Polonius in <span class="italic">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</span> (1990), and various mandarins or judges in <span class="italic">Brazil</span> (1985), <span class="italic">Cry Freedom</span> (1987), <span class="italic">M Butterfly</span> (1993), <span class="italic">From Hell</span> (2001), and <span class="italic">Becoming Jane</span> (2007). In America he was probably best known for his appearances in commercials for Grey Poupon mustard, &#145;a matter of infinite regret&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Yorker</span>, 13 Aug 2007).<br>
<br>Partly at the prompting of a young actor who confronted him with the irresponsibility of denying a younger generation the opportunity of seeing his work on stage, Richardson returned to the theatre to play the title roles in Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">The Miser</span> (1995) and Pinero's <span class="italic">The Magistrate</span> (1998), both at the Chichester Festival Theatre. He continued his association with the RSC, taking part in occasional all-star tours of <span class="italic">The Hollow Crown</span> from 2002 to 2004, alongside his fellow RSC alumni Sir Donald Sinden, Sir Derek Jacobi, and Dame Diana Rigg. It seemed wrong that Richardson, who had been appointed CBE in 1989, did not have a title himself. After another gap he played in a West End thriller, <span class="italic">The Creeper</span> by Pauline Macauley, in 2006, and rather more happily made his much belated National Theatre d&eacute;but the same year, voluptuous as Sir Epicure Mammon in Nicholas Hytner's production of <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>. It was to be his last stage appearance.<br>
<br>Richardson had been about to start work on an episode of the popular television series <span class="italic">Midsomer Murders</span> when he died suddenly, in his sleep and at his home, 131 Lavender Sweep, Battersea, on 9 February 2007, of heart failure, with his wife by his side. They had been a devoted couple, Richardson having said that &#145;without Maroussia I cannot function. I don't know which bank my account is with, the name of my accountant or how to work the Aga&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 25 Feb 2006). He was also survived by his two sons. A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, and his ashes were interred in row A in the stalls of the newly rebuilt Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, where he had given so many memorable performances.<br>
