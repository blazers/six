<span class="headword">Bourchier <span class="st"> [Bousser]</span>,  Robert</span>, first Lord Bourchier  (<em>d.</em> 1349), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2989/', "Sir John Bousser (d. 1329/30)")</script>, a judge of the common pleas, and his wife, Helen, daughter of Walter of Colchester. The family's estates lay in Essex, where Robert later added substantially to them, especially in and around Halstead. He is first recorded in 1318, and later appears to have been employed by the de Vere earls of Oxford, whose estates were concentrated in Essex, but from the late 1320s he also served the crown. In 1327 he accompanied Sir Bartholomew Burghersh on a diplomatic mission to Charles IV of France. He was returned as a knight of the shire for Essex to the parliaments of 1328&#150;9, 1330 (twice), 1332 (once), and 1339 (both). In 1329 he was a commissioner of the peace in Essex, and during the 1330s he was appointed to a modest number of judicial commissions, nearly all in that county, but there is no evidence that he received a formal legal training, and though in 1334 he was appointed chief justice of the justiciar's bench in Ireland, he never took up office. If anything he pursued a military career. He was ordered to join the invasion of Scotland in the summer of 1335, and though the mistaken belief that he fought at Cadsand in November 1337 is attributable to an error (subsequently often repeated) by his descendant John Bourchier, Lord Berners, in the latter's translation of Froissart, in July 1338 he was in the company of the earl of Northampton, when the earl accompanied Edward III to Flanders. He also established links with Hugh Audley, earl of Gloucester, from whom he was receiving a fee of &pound;100 per annum by 1340.<br>
<br>On 14 December 1340 Bourchier was appointed chancellor of England, the first layman to hold that office. The context of his appointment was Edward III's quarrel with Archbishop John Stratford, over the alleged failure of the English administration to support the king's war effort in Flanders and France. The primate's brother Ralph Stratford, bishop of Chichester, was dismissed as chancellor, and Bourchier was chosen to replace him, presumably as a competent man of affairs who could be relied upon to do the king's bidding. His relative lack of personal means, which led to special arrangements having to be made to finance the chancery clerks in his household, and to the king's providing an annual fee of &pound;100 to replace the one Bourchier had been receiving from Audley, was doubtless a positive advantage in Edward's eyes, since it made the new chancellor more dependent upon royal favour than an ecclesiastical magnate could be trusted to be. Bourchier appears to have fulfilled the king's expectations. In the first parliament of 1341, along with Bishop Orleton of Winchester and Sir John Darcy, he urged the archbishop to submit to the king. And though the parliament extracted the king's assent to articles requiring that officers of state be appointed and sworn in parliament, Bourchier protested against the king's concession, and it was later repealed.<br>
<br>Bourchier resigned as chancellor on 27 October 1341, but continued to serve as a member of the king's council; in 1345 a debt to the crown was specifically remitted for his good services in this respect. He also served the king again as a soldier, in the autumn of 1342 accompanying Edward to Brittany in command of a contingent of men-at-arms. But the &#145;sires de Boursier&#146; whom Froissart records as fighting in the division of Edward, the Black Prince, at the battle of Cr&eacute;cy in 1346 may well have been Bourchier's son and heir, John, born of his marriage (by 1329) to Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Prayers of Sible Hedingham and his wife, Anne, daughter of Hugh of Essex. In the late 1340s Robert Bourchier was once more employed as a diplomat. In 1347 he was among those empowered to negotiate a truce with France, and early in 1348 he was commissioned to accompany the king's daughter Joan to Spain, there to marry the future Pedro I of Castile, but she fell victim to plague at Bordeaux. In November 1348 he received a personal summons to parliament, and is consequently regarded as having become Lord Bourchier. Robert Bourchier died between 12 March and 18 August 1349, probably of the black death, and was buried at Halstead, where he had intended to found a college of eight chaplains.<br>
