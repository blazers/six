<span class="headword">Littler,  Prince Frank</span>  (1901&#150;1973), <span class="occ">theatre proprietor and manager</span>, was born Jules Horace Virgil Emile Richeux, at 5 Kent Terrace, Ramsgate, Kent, on 25 July 1901, the elder son in the family of two sons and three daughters of Jules Richeux (1863&#150;1911), cigar importer, and his wife, Agnes May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paisey (<i>b</i>. 1874). His father became a theatrical proprietor, leasing the Ramsgate Victoria Pavilion from 1906, while his mother leased the Artillery Theatre, Woolwich, from 1909. After his father's death his mother married, in 1914, the theatre manager Frank Rolison Littler (1879&#150;1940), who adopted the five children, the latter taking Littler's name. In addition to Prince (as he was known from childhood) two of the other children made careers in the theatre: the second son, Emile Littler (1903&#150;1985), and second daughter, Blanche Littler, later Lady Robey (1899&#150;1981), went into theatrical management. Prince was educated privately at Stratford upon Avon, and started his theatrical career in 1927 with his sister, Blanche, sending out small-scale regional tours and becoming resident manager of his parents' theatre in Woolwich.<br>
<br>In 1931 Prince bought his first two theatres, both in Leicester. On 17 November 1932 he married a widow, Annie Leonora Maclachlan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Delaney 
    (the actress Norah Delaney; <i>b</i>. 1893/4)
  . During the rest of the thirties he acquired further theatres in Manchester and Norwich, and by the end of the decade he was also touring George Robey (whom Blanche soon married, as his second wife) in <span class="italic">The Bing Boys are Here</span>. His first London ventures were pantomimes at the Coliseum, the Prince's, and Drury Lane, but in 1939 he scored his first great West End success with Ivor Novello's long-running operetta <span class="italic">Glamorous Night</span>.<br>
<br>With the coming of the Second World War Prince Littler was appointed chairman and managing director of first the Stoll (later Stoll Moss) and then the Associated Theatres chains, which effectively left him as resident manager of the Globe Theatre and (until it was bombed) the Queen's Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue as well as the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which in 1946 Littler reopened after its wartime occupation by the Entertainments National Service Association, with No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Pacific 1860</span>. This was not a great success, and already it was becoming clear that, unlike his brother Emile, Littler had no special affection for plays or players individually; his interest was the business of showbusiness, and he remained throughout the rest of his life, despite a long and happy marriage, primarily a money-man, interested only in bricks and mortar and in the profits that could be made, either in London or on the road, with the right&#151;that is, long-running and star-led&#151;attractions. He was always a landlord and a manager, seldom a producer in the creative sense.<br>
<br>By 1947 Littler was chairman of Moss Empires and a director of the Howard and Wyndham chain, a double responsibility which gave him unique powers as a landlord in London and the regions; he was also one of the first to import tried-and-tested Broadway hits, so that his post-war shows included such musicals as <span class="italic">Carousel</span>, <span class="italic">Guys and Dolls</span>, and <span class="italic">Can-Can</span>, as well as two straight plays which had also been great Broadway hits, <span class="italic">Teahouse of the August Moon</span> and <span class="italic">No Time for Sergeants</span>. He was a reasonably fair and decent landlord, and the case against him was principally that he felt no interest in investing in the unknown or in fostering local talent when his theatres could be filled with pre-existing hits of one transatlantic kind or another; he always played safe, but fought several prolonged board-room battles to protect and preserve his empire and of course his Empires. In 1960 he fought successfully a takeover attempt for Stoll by a formidable team which included Bernard Delfont and the property millionaires Jack Cotton and Charles Clore; later that year he merged Stoll with Moss Empires, thereby gaining control of sixteen London theatres, including the Palladium and the Victoria Palace, as well as a major shareholding in one of the founding ITV companies in Britain, Associated Television. As with the Grade organization, this concentration of showbusiness power led to several legal actions (in one of which he fought his own brother Emile, though privately the brothers remained on good terms) as rival managers tried to chip away at the Littler holdings.<br>
<br>A passionate breeder of Guernsey dairy cattle in his spare time, Prince Littler always refused the limelight. He gave only one major press interview in 1961, in which he announced: &#145;I am not in the theatre for fun, but merely to keep my shareholders happy&#146;, and that was indeed always his credo. If a show failed to make money or pay its rent, Littler would close it as swiftly as possible and go in search of a more profitable tenant for his stages. He was, however, a chairman of the Denville Hall home for elderly thespians, a vice-president of the Variety Artists Benevolent Fund, and a member of both the South Bank Theatre and Opera House boards. His last three shows, <span class="italic">The Black and White Minstrel Show</span>, <span class="italic">There's a Girl in my Soup</span>, and <span class="italic">Fiddler on the Roof</span> (all 1966) were considerable hits, and when he died seven years later, after a peaceful retirement, they dimmed all the West End theatre lights in tribute to one of its most dominant and successful landlords.<br>
<br>Littler was made a CBE in 1957. He died on 13 September 1973 at his home, Chestham Park, Henfield, Sussex. After his death, one last legal battle was fought to clarify a complex series of bequests arising from two apparently contradictory wills; the estate had been valued at just over &pound;1 million, and there were no children.<br>
