<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richardson,  John Samuel</span>, Baron Richardson  (1910&#150;2004), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 16 June 1910 at 105 Osborne Road, Ecclesall, Sheffield, the elder son of John Watson Richardson (1882&#150;1917), solicitor and company director, who was killed in action during the First World War, and his wife, Elizabeth Blakeney, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts (<i>d</i>. 1969), only daughter of Sir Samuel Roberts, first baronet, politician. His forebears on both sides of the family had connections with the steel industry and Richardson was proud of his Yorkshire heritage. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and did his medical training at St Thomas's Hospital, London. On 6 June 1933 he married Sybil Angela Stephanie Trist (1904&#150;1991), an art student who trained at the Slade School of Fine Art and the Royal Academy, and daughter of Ronald Arthur Trist, merchant. Richardson tried, unsuccessfully, to keep this a secret as marriage was thought to impede a medical career. After graduating MB BChir at Cambridge in 1936 he served as a house physician at St Thomas's and briefly as a registrar. He and his wife had two daughters, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1937) and Susan (<i>b</i>. 1940).<br>
<br>Richardson joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in August 1939, a month before the outbreak of the Second World War, took part in the Dunkirk evacuation, and was later posted to north Africa as a medical specialist with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. There he was nominated &#145;physician in attendance&#146; to George VI when the latter visited the troops in 1943; he treated the king for sunburn, for which he was appointed LVO. He then travelled with the royal party to Malta, and on board ship met Harold Macmillan, an event that was to have a considerable impact on his professional life.<br>
<br>Richardson went back to St Thomas's after the war and, thinking it wise to have a chest radiograph though he had no symptoms, was horrified to find a cavity in the left lung due to tuberculosis. A year's intensive treatment enabled him to return to work, and in 1948 he was appointed consultant physician; he spent his entire career at Thomas's, retiring as senior physician in 1975. Because of his patrician appearance his first students nicknamed him &#145;Sir John&#146;; later (when he was Sir John) he was universally known as &#145;JSR&#146;. Among the last of the truly general physician&#150;teachers, he had little appetite for research or writing scientific papers, though he edited the <span class="italic">British Encyclopaedia of Medical Practice</span> (1970&#150;74) and published a text on rheumatic diseases. He was physician to hospitals in Watford and Wembley, the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers, the Metropolitan Police, and London Transport, and honorary consultant physician to the army. He practised privately from 33 Devonshire Place and lived at 1 Hillcrest Road, Ealing.<br>
<br>Harold Macmillan began to seek the opinion of Richardson&#151;&#145;who looked after me so well in Africa&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 190)&#151;in the early 1950s, and soon treated him as his personal physician. The close friendship and trust that developed between them was the result of the patrician outlook and political nous they shared. Macmillan was prone to hypochondria and tended to suffer from episodes of ill health brought on by overwork; the doctor provided the reassurance of the wise physician. Richardson accompanied Macmillan on trips abroad between 1957 and 1963, and continued to look after him when he retired from office. When Richardson went on holiday, staff at St Thomas's had strict instructions to contact him in an emergency: it was all the more surprising therefore that when Macmillan developed prostate trouble and retention of urine in 1963 while Richardson was in the Lake District, other specialists were called in and advised an operation. There was talk of possible cancer, and Macmillan decided to hand in his resignation. Although Richardson raced back to London and said he thought the prime minister could carry on after a suitable convalescence, there was no turning back. Having been knighted in 1960, Richardson was created a baronet in Macmillan's resignation honours of 1963.<br>
<br>Richardson's quick grasp of essentials, shrewdness, and ability to manipulate&#151;his critics inevitably labelled him &#145;devious&#146;&#151;made him a natural choice to head numerous medical bodies. He was president of the International Society of Internal Medicine (1970), the Royal Society of Medicine (1969&#150;71), and the British Medical Association (1970&#150;71), and master of the Society of Apothecaries (1971&#150;2), having served on their governing bodies. He was particularly pleased with his role as chairman of the influential Joint Consultants' Committee (1967&#150;72), set up to spearhead much-needed modernization of medical organization in hospitals.<br>
<br>Richardson's skill in promoting change was seen at its best when he succeeded Lord Cohen of Birkenhead as president of the medical profession's disciplinary body, the General Medical Council, in 1973. The government had already bowed to calls for a public inquiry into its function; Richardson quietly set about dismantling outmoded formalities and ceremonial and replacing the forbidding court of law that was the disciplinary committee with a more informal discussion among peers, so that by the time of the inquiry report (in 1979) he had already made all the recommended reforms, apart from those requiring legislation. Michael O'Donnell, editor of <span class="italic">World Medicine</span>, a member but also a fierce critic of the council, in an article entitled &#145;What was the old devil up to?&#146;, admitted that &#145;few people outside the Council appreciate how remarkable was his achievement&#146;  (O'Donnell, 31). On retiring in 1980 Richardson said that he had greatly enjoyed himself, especially his meetings with the combative secretary of state for social services, Barbara Castle. In contrast, a particular disappointment was that he never became president of the Royal College of Physicians, being runner-up on at least two occasions, because fellows were suspicious of his motives. He derived some comfort from being asked to deliver the Harveian oration in 1978. This was the most prestigious lecture in the gift of the college, and Richardson chose as his title &#145;Harvey's exhortation&#146; to reaffirm the physicians' duty to discipline themselves.<br>
<br>Richardson, who was made a life peer in 1979, as Baron Richardson, of Lee, in the county of Devon, was a tall, commanding figure, with a firm step; he was always immaculately dressed. His manner was aloof and rather forbidding, but beneath the austere exterior was a man of considerable charm and compassion, who endeared himself particularly to patients and students. Colleagues admired his great intellect but were suspicious of his enigmatic behaviour. During his long retirement in north Devon he was active in the House of Lords on medical matters and especially those connected with his alma mater. He was a keen gardener, and when asked about his hobbies and interests said that &#145;he was interested in most things&#146;  (Royal College of Physicians archives). He died of bronchopneumonia on 15 August 2004 at Tyspane Nursing Home, Braunton, Devon. After cremation his ashes were buried in Mortehoe cemetery, near Ilfracombe. He was survived by his two daughters.<br>
