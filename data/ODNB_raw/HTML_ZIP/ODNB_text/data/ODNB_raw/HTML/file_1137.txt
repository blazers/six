<span class="headword">Baker,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1680/81), <span class="occ">playwright and journalist</span>, was said to have been &#145;the Son of an eminent Attorney in <i>King-street</i>, near <i>Guildhall</i>, in the City of <i>London</i>&#146;  (Mottley, 166). His comedy <span class="italic">The Humour of the Age</span> was premi&egrave;red at Drury Lane on 1 March 1701 and in his dedicatory letter the young author owned himself &#145;oblig'd to the Town for the extraordinary Reception this Rough Draught met with&#146;. In February 1702 the Drury Lane actors were prosecuted for immoral expressions in three plays, including Baker's, but were acquitted. Baker's very successful <span class="italic">Tunbridge-Walks, or, The Yeoman of Kent</span>, was premi&egrave;red in January 1703. It received regular performances throughout the first half of the century and was revived by Kitty Clive for her benefit in 1764. <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> claimed that Baker, realizing that he had acquired effeminate mannerisms, wrote the part of the fop Maiden (played by William Bullock) to parody himself and then reformed his behaviour.<br>
<br>Baker was apparently working as a lawyer by November 1703, when the prologue to Mary Pix's <span class="italic">The Different Widows</span> refers to his attending a judge at Westminster Hall. This was a period of puritan attacks on theatrical immorality and Baker's next play, the racy <span class="italic">An Act at Oxford</span>, was banned. The dedicatory letter of the 1704 text speaks of the &#145;favourable Reception and happy agreeable Conversation&#146; Baker had had at Oxford, but it is not clear whether he was ever a student there. The play was reworked as <span class="italic">Hampstead Heath</span>, which seems to have achieved only three performances, at Drury Lane in autumn 1705. In the &#145;Long Vacation Prologue&#146;, spoken by Richard Estcourt at Drury Lane in September 1708, Baker deplored the union of London's two theatre companies, which had taken place that January and reduced opportunities for actors and playwrights. Baker claimed that his last play, <span class="italic">The Fine Lady's Airs</span> (premi&egrave;red on 14 December 1708), was well received, but it proved too satirical for the taste of the time, as did Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">The Modern Prophets</span> a few months later. Baker referred to the failure of D'Urfey's play in the prologue he wrote for Susanna Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busybody</span> (first performed on 12 May 1709) and D'Urfey responded with a full-scale attack, in which he claimed <span class="italic">The Fine Lady's Airs</span> had been &#145;deservedly hist&#146;  (D'Urfey, &#145;Preface&#146; to <span class="italic">The Modern Prophets</span>, 1709). Baker was by now disenchanted with the business of playwrighting and was considering abandoning it for &#145;something which may prove more serviceable to the Publick, and beneficial to my self&#146;  (Baker, &#145;Dedication&#146;, <span class="italic">The Fine Lady's Airs</span>).<br>
<br>Baker turned to journalism and on 8 July 1709, writing under the pseudonym of Phoebe Crackenthorpe, &#145;a Lady that knows every thing&#146;, inaugurated the <span class="italic">Female Tatler</span>. This entertaining tri-weekly periodical, with its satirical portraits, theatrical gossip, and mock advertisements, was published first by Benjamin Bragge and from number 19 by Anne Baldwin. The <span class="italic">Female Tatler</span> aroused the wrath of a rival journal, the <span class="italic">British Apollo</span>, which repeatedly attacked the supposed Mrs Crackenthorpe:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">this wise Undertaker,<br>
</div>
<div>By Trade's an <i>At&#151;ney</i>, by Name is a <i>B&#151;r.</i>
<br>
</div> (14 Sept 1709)</blockquote>It wrote (more than once) of the thrashing &#145;B&#151;r&#146; received for his satirical attack on a city deputy, of the damning of his play, of his poverty, and of his being cast off by his nearest relations. In number 51 of the <span class="italic">Female Tatler</span> (2 November 1709) Mrs Crackenthorpe announced that &#145;she&#146; was resigning in favour of &#145;a Society of Modest Ladies&#146; and Baker's connection with the journal ceased. According to Mottley, Baker left London for Worcestershire, &#145;being under Disgrace with his Father, who allow'd him but a very scanty Income&#146; and died there &#145;the Death of the great <i>Sylla</i>, the <i>Roman</i> Dictator, of that loathsome distemper the <i>Morbus Pediculosus</i>&#146;  (Mottley, 167).<br>
