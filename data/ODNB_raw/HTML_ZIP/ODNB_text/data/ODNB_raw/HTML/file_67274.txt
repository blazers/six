<span class="headword">Leach,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1631&#150;1655), <span class="occ">attorney and pamphleteer</span>, was the son and heir of John Leach of Felmersham, Bedfordshire, gentleman. Little else is known of his personal background except that he resided for most of his adult life with his wife in a ground chamber of the Middle Temple on the side leading out of Pump Court, which he was granted for life in 1655.<br>
<br>Leach entered the Middle Temple in June 1631 and was specially admitted on 25 January 1632. By the summer of 1635 he had established himself as a &#145;common attorney&#146;, rather than advancing to the bar. Although almost nothing is known of his professional life in the London area, court records indicate that he and his wife were frequently in debt in the latter half of the 1640s. Nevertheless he acceded to the honorary office of tipstaff to the high court of justice in 1650.<br>
<br>Leach brought his experience as a common attorney, as well as a defendant, to the public discussion of legal reform that followed the execution of Charles I in 1649. Over the next four years he published sixteen pamphlets consisting of &#145;queries and proposals&#146; which together outlined a programme for the reform of the entire English legal system. His concern throughout was to spur debate on the institutional corruption and nuisance cases that he believed cost the English people &#145;millions of money&#146; yearly and to offer viable remedies.<br>
<br>Leach's primary focus was the corruption and inadequacies of local legal jurisdiction. He devoted several pamphlets to the need for the complete overhaul of debtor's law, which, he thought, contributed to the rise of begging, vagabondage, and crime. He estimated that there were some 20,000 people imprisoned for debt in England in 1650. Most of these, he argued, either did not have the immediate means to pay their creditors or chose to remain in prison to defraud them. As a remedy, he proposed that a creditor be granted a court writ authorizing the seizure of a debtor's possessions in lieu of imprisonment. He also advocated stringent regulation of the jury system. In <span class="italic">The Bribe-Takers of Jury-Men</span> (1652) he complained that the fall in money values allowed such disreputable types as &#145;needy alehouse-keepers&#146;, who were subject to pressure from their bailiff customers, to sit on lower court juries. He also charged that sheriffs failed to summon knights, esquires, gentlemen, and the &#145;better sort&#146; in general to jury service, in return for gain or patronage. Leach's proposals for juries included a property qualification of at least 40<i>s</i>. annual taxable value, a sobriety test, a secret ballot system for verdicts, laws to punish jury tampering by men of influence, and the right to attaint individual jurors.<br>
<br>Leach was fully aware of the rising tide of litigation inundating the Westminster courts. Unlike radical reformers who called for the abolition of the common law courts, he instead focused on procedural reforms to cut waste and increase efficiency, since he believed that decentralization of the courts would inevitably lead to excessive variation in the interpretation of law. To reduce litigation, Leach recommended that plaintiffs offer a security in the amount for which they were suing, and that the decisions of courts at every level be final. He also highlighted the widespread abuse of writs issued by the chancery court by those attempting to impede or expedite the judgments of lower courts, and by the chancery clerks who trafficked in the sale of writs and precedents. As a palliative he proposed that disputed judgments be returned to their court of origin for amendment and that all writs and precedents be published so that the common litigant would have free access to them.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">A New Parliament</span> (1651) Leach applied his understanding of the corruption of local jurisdictions to the election and sitting of parliament. He recommended annual sittings with fixed election dates, a franchise limited to all ratepayers, secret ballots, the use of election scrutineers, and an end to the representation of depopulated boroughs. He also believed that the presence of &#145;learned lawyers&#146; among the MPs was necessary for the enactment of good laws and the avoidance of confusion. Yet despite his high estimation of the legal profession, he elsewhere advocated the abolition of its monopoly on pleading in the lower courts, a set schedule of fees, and the establishment of a central registry of all legal documents open to the people in the name of cost-efficiency.<br>
<br>Leach's work bears witness to the marked upsurge of litigation in the first half of the seventeenth century, and the resulting popular frustration with the justice system at all levels. On the whole, his views were in line with most contemporary moderate reformers, whose work he supported in Barebone's Parliament and the Hale commission.<br>
