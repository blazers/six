<span class="headword">Taylor,  Jefferys</span>  (1792&#150;1853), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 30 October 1792 in Cooke's House, Shilling Street, Lavenham, Suffolk, the ninth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27033/', "Isaac Taylor (1759&#150;1829)")</script>, engraver, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27018/', "Ann Taylor, n&#233;e Martin (1757&#150;1830)")</script>, also a children's writer. He was named for the family of his paternal grandmother, who was born Sarah Jefferys, the niece of Thomas Jefferys the geographer. Taylor was born lame, a misfortune commemorated in an early poem by his sister Ann (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10681/', "Ann Gilbert (1782&#150;1866)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27039/', "Taylor, Jane (1783&#150;1824)")</script>]). Like all his siblings he was educated at home, benefiting from a remarkably broad curriculum devised by his father and aimed principally at exciting intellectual curiosity. He was trained by his father as an engraver and, like his older brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27034/', "Isaac Taylor (1787&#150;1865)")</script> and Martin, formally apprenticed to him.<br>
<br>Until Taylor's marriage on 20 June 1826 to Sophia Mabbs of Mount Nessing, Essex, he appears to have lived at home, successively in Lavenham, in Colchester, and in Ongar, and it was at New House Farm just outside Ongar, during a painful illness, that he wrote his first book, <span class="italic">Harry's Holiday</span>, which was published in 1818. It ran to several editions and was followed over the next ten years by a string of other successful books for the young, including <span class="italic">Aesop in Rhyme</span> (1820), <span class="italic">The Little Historians</span> (1824), and <span class="italic">Parlour Commentaries on the Constitution and Laws of England</span> (1825). Most of his books were overtly educational in purpose, but often supplied with a superficial fictional context; in a few, such as <span class="italic">Harry's Holiday</span> and <span class="italic">Ralph Richards the Miser</span> (1821), this emphasis was reversed and the fictional element predominated. Most were illustrated with engravings; those not signed by others were probably his own work.<br>
<br>Throughout his life, Jefferys Taylor was fascinated by machinery and, in his ramshackle attic under the leads at New House Farm, he invented a machine for ruling straight and close lines for engravings, which was a considerable financial success. On the death of his father in 1829, he seems to have taken on his commitments to the popular <span class="roman">Little Library</span> series published by John Harris, for which he wrote <span class="italic">The Forest</span> (1831), <span class="italic">The Farm</span> (1832), and <span class="italic">The Ocean</span> (1833). There is then a gap of nearly ten years before the publication of his next book, <span class="italic">The Young Islanders</span> (1842), an early Robinsonnade, in which an entire boys' school is cast away on a desert island; it was particularly successful in America, where it ran to eight editions over the next forty years. <span class="italic">Incidents of the Apostolic Age of Britain</span> (1844) was an early historical novel for children and probably the first of the genre to deal with very remote events. <span class="italic">A Glance at the Globe and at the Worlds Around Us</span> (1848), an introduction to cosmology and world history, is interesting in that it anticipates Charles Kingsley in avowedly attempting to reconcile for children belief in a divine creator with recent discoveries in geology and palaeontology.<br>
<br>Jefferys Taylor's first married home was grand, a large Jacobean house (now the Dower House) at Forty Hill, Enfield, Middlesex. Later, for over ten years, he lived at Pilgrim's Hatch, Essex, then a common abutting extensive woodland, until in 1846 financial difficulties forced him to sell up and move to Broadstairs St Peter's, Kent. Here, in July 1852, in a house in the High Street, he suffered a paralytic stroke from which he never recovered. Nursed at the end by his recently widowed sister Ann&#151;his own wife lay bedridden in an adjacent room&#151;he died on 8 August 1853. Although brought up a dissenter, like his brothers he had joined the established church in later life, and he was buried in the churchyard of St Peter's, Broadstairs. His tombstone, sketched by a relative in 1895, has not survived.<br>
<br>Jefferys Taylor was by all accounts an avuncular and genial man, much given to jokes and puns, but had also a penchant for the ghostly and the macabre, a combination likely to appeal to children then as now. (It was his tragedy that the only child of his own marriage, Edward, had died young.) His appearance and character are described by his nephew Josiah Gilbert:<blockquote>Indeed, his massive head and sparkling grey eye seemed to indicate more of power than the delicate features of his brother Isaac, but it was a power untrained, and fitfully exerted, and the whole aspect of the man, the halting gait, supported by a stick, the burly form, the quizzical features, bespoke the wayward genius he too truly was. (Gilbert, 2.141)</blockquote>
