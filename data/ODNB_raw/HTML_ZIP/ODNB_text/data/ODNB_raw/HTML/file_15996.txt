<span class="headword">Lane, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1584, <em>d.</em> 1650), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was the first son of Richard Lane, yeoman of Courteenhall, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Clement Vincent of Harpole, Northamptonshire, and was baptized at Harpole on 12 November 1584. He attended Westminster School and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a scholar in 1602. From Cambridge he proceeded to the Middle Temple where he was admitted on 8 February 1605 and was called to the bar on 22 November 1611. Lane appears to have practised primarily in the court of exchequer&#151;a court on whose bench he would later serve. He also served as deputy recorder of Northampton in 1615 and as recorder in 1628. He was possibly a patron or relation of the poet Thomas Randolph who dedicated to Lane his <span class="italic">The Jealous Lovers</span> of 1632. On 30 October 1629 the Middle Temple chose him as Lent reader for 1630 and in 1634 he became attorney-general to the prince of Wales. In 1635 he served as counsel to the University of Cambridge and on 12 June that year he became a bencher of his inn. He became treasurer of the Middle Temple in 1637 and in May 1638 Henry, earl of Holland, nominated him as his deputy in forest courts.<br>
<br>Early in 1641 Lane served as legal counsel to Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford, during his impeachment and attainder on a charge of high treason in the Long Parliament. On 17 April 1641 during the debate on the bill of attainder Lane argued that the statute 1 Hen. IV c. 10 had effectively repealed the declaratory power invested in parliament by the great <span class="roman">Statute of Treasons</span>  (25 Ed. III). As a result the Long Parliament had neither the law nor the authority to proceed against Wentworth by bill of attainder. Parliament, however, rejected this argument and Charles I reluctantly gave his assent to the bill of attainder on 10 May 1641. The unfortunate Wentworth was duly beheaded on Tower Hill on 12 May 1641.<br>
<br>Lane also served as counsel to the impeached ship money judge Sir Robert Berkeley from October 1641 and the imprisoned twelve bishops in January 1642. Like most of the judiciary and crown law officers he remained loyal to the king at the outbreak of general hostilities with the Long Parliament in the summer of 1642. Upon joining Charles I at Oxford the king quickly rewarded Lane and he received the degree of MA from the University of Oxford on 1 November 1642. In 1643 the Long Parliament ordered that his &#145;chambers, goods, chattels and books&#146; at the Middle Temple be seized and his estate sequestered for his adherence to the king  (Hopwood, 1005). From the king, however, there were only further rewards. On 4 January 1644 Charles knighted Lane at Oxford and on 23 January raised him to the degree of serjeant-at-law in a ceremony held at the philosophy school. Two days later he was made chief baron of the exchequer and on 31 January he received the degree of DCL from the University of Oxford. In January 1645 he was one of the king's commissioners at the failed Uxbridge negotiations where he resisted parliamentarian demands that parliament have sole control of the militia.<br>
<br>Upon the death of Sir Edward Littleton the king appointed Lane on 30 August 1645 as lord keeper of the great seal. When Oxford surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax on 24 June 1646 Lane acted on the king's behalf. In negotiating the articles of capitulation he struggled unsuccessfully to retain control of the great seal, the seals of the other courts, and the sword of state. Fairfax sent the items to parliament and on 3 July 1646 the Long Parliament resolved to have the king's seal destroyed. This was accomplished on 11 August 1646, the seal being ceremonially broken up by a smith and its remnants distributed between the speakers of both houses. Charles II renewed his patent and Lane remained the Stuarts' nominal lord keeper until his death. He followed the newly disinherited king into exile, landing at St Malo in March 1650 in poor health. About this time he wrote to the king asking him to make his eldest son, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1616), a groom of the bedchamber&#151;a request that the king fulfilled. Lane subsequently moved to Jersey where he died on 12 May 1650 and was buried at St Helier. James, duke of York, attended the funeral. Lane's wife, Margaret, died on 22 April 1669. Although Lane had entrusted his chambers, library, and goods to his friend Bulstrode Whitelocke, the latter would later deny all knowledge when Lane's son applied for them.<br>
<br>Lane's lasting significance lay in his legal reporting activities, notably as the posthumous author of <span class="italic">Reports in the court of exchequer beginning in the third, and ending in the ninth year of the raign of the late King James</span> (1657), which contained an important report of Chief Baron Sir Thomas Fleming's opinion in <i>Bate's case</i> (1606). Charles Francis Morrell reprinted this set of reports in a new edition of 1884 and they were incorporated into <span class="italic">The English Reports</span> in 1914.<br>
