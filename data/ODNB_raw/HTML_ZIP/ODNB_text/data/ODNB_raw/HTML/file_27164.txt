<span class="headword">Thellusson,  Peter</span>  (1737&#150;1797), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Paris on 27 June 1737, the third son of Isaac de Thellusson (1690&#150;1755), banker in Paris and minister of Geneva at the court of France (1730&#150;44), and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Abraham Le Boullenger, of Leiden. The family of Thellusson was of French origin, but took refuge at Geneva during the French wars of religion. Isaac's second son, George (1728&#150;1776), and his partner, Jacques Necker, the future minister of Louis XVI, built up in Paris a first-class banking house.<br>
<br>On 6 January 1761 Thellusson married Ann, second daughter of Matthew Woodford of Southampton, and sister of an MP; they had three sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Peter Isaac Thellusson (1761&#150;1808), MP from 1795, was on 1 February 1806 created Baron Rendelsham in the Irish peerage.<br>
<br>Peter Thellusson was sent to England to complete his education in 1761 and was naturalized by act of parliament in the same year. He set up as a merchant banker in London, with help from his brother George and from Pierre Naville, a London merchant from Geneva, who had married his sister. He was agent for his brother's Paris house, as well as for Vandenyver &amp; Cie and other great houses of Paris, Geneva, and Amsterdam. He insured in London French ships sailing to the East Indies; in 1779 he helped to invest &pound;100,000 from Geneva in the Irish tontine. He thus was a typical member of the &#145;Huguenot International&#146;. He also engaged in business on his own account, trading chiefly with the West Indies, and speculated on the stock exchange. In the early years of the French Revolution, he was the chief London correspondent of Greffulhe and Montz, who had taken over the Thellusson&#150;Necker bank. In connection with them, he speculated on specie and on assignats, and he received large sums which were exported from France by or for the &eacute;migr&eacute;s. He thus amassed a considerable fortune, and, among other landed property, purchased the estate of Brodsworth in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Thellusson died on 21 July 1797 at his seat at Plaistow, near Bromley in Kent. By his will, dated 2 April 1796, he left &pound;100,000 to his wife and children. The remainder of his fortune, valued at &pound;600,000 or &pound;800,000, he assigned to trustees to accumulate during the lives of his sons and his sons' sons, and of their issue existing at the time of his death. On the death of the last survivor the estate was to be divided equally among the three eldest male lineal descendants of his three sons then living. If there were no heir, the property was to go to the extinction of the national debt. At the time of Thellusson's death he had no great-grandchildren, and in consequence the trust was limited to the life of two generations. The will was generally seen as absurd, and the family endeavoured to get it set aside. On 20 April 1799 the lord chancellor, Alexander Wedderburn, Lord Loughborough, pronounced the will valid, and his decision was confirmed by the House of Lords on 25 June 1805. As it was calculated that the accumulation might reach &pound;140 million, the will was regarded by some as a peril to the country, and an act&#151;often called the <span class="roman">Thellusson Act</span>&#151;was passed in 1800 prohibiting similar schemes of bequest. A second lawsuit arose in 1856, when Charles Thellusson, the last grandson, died. It was decided in the House of Lords on 9 June 1859. As George Woodford Thellusson, Peter's second son, had no issue, the estate was divided between Frederick William Brook Thellusson, fifth Baron Rendlesham (1840&#150;1911), and Charles Sabine Augustus Thellusson (1822&#150;1885), grandson of Charles, Peter's third son. In consequence of mismanagement and the costs of litigation, they succeeded to only a comparatively moderate fortune.<br>
