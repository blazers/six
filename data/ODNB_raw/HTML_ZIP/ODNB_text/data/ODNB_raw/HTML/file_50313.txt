<span class="headword">Wingfield,  Walter Clopton</span>  (1833&#150;1912), <span class="occ">inventor of lawn tennis</span>, was born on 16 October 1833, the eldest son of Clopton Lewis Wingfield (1800&#150;1846) of Rhysnant Hall, Montgomeryshire, a major in the 66th regiment, and his wife, Jane Eliza, daughter of General Sir John Michell. He served in the 1st dragoon guards, where he reached the rank of captain before retiring to his estate in Montgomeryshire, where he was a JP for the county and a major in the yeomanry cavalry. As one of the royal bodyguard of gentlemen-at-arms, he was made a member of the Victorian order in 1902. On 1 November 1858 he married Alice, youngest daughter of General Wheeler Cleveland, with whom he had three sons, all of whom predeceased him, and a daughter.<br>
<br>Looking to the commercial possibilities of exploiting the growing demand for genteel outdoor leisure to be enjoyed on the lawns of middle-class England, Wingfield devised the game of sphairistike. He took the name from the Greek for gymnastic ball games, but, on the advice of friends, added &#145;or lawn tennis&#146; to its title. Tradition has it that he first showed off the game at a Welsh country house Christmas party at Nantclwyd in 1873, before patenting it in February 1874. However, this must have been the final version, for he had demonstrated it to Lord Lansdowne in the summer of 1869. Certainly others, including Major Harry Gem, played their own versions of lawn tennis before Wingfield's patent or even before his demonstration to Lord Lansdowne. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that it was Wingfield who first publicized and popularized the game.<br>
<br>Sphairistike was a hybrid of real tennis and rackets but took them outdoors. The original court was hour-glass in design, though with straight sides and a lozenge-shaped service area within the court, which was itself marked out with tapes. Wingfield wrote an eight-page instruction book, <span class="italic">The Game of Sphairistike</span>, to accompany the sets of equipment, 1050 of which were sold within a year at 5 guineas through French &amp; Co. By the third edition the Greek nomenclature, abbreviated to &#145;sticky&#146; by its detractors, had gone.<br>
<br>Although Wingfield first devised and named lawn tennis, within a few years the game had changed considerably to become almost unrecognizable from the original. In 1875 the Marylebone Cricket Club revised Wingfield's rules and adopted an oblong court, with players retreating to the baseline to serve. Such a rectangular court was also preferred for the first national championships in 1877, when the All England croquet club added lawn tennis to its title. A committee of the club then settled the size of the court, lowered the net, allowed the server one fault without penalty, and determined a scoring system based on real tennis. All that remained of Wingfield's rules was the option to choose rackets' scoring, but by 1883 this too had disappeared. These changes undermined any protection that his patent had given Wingfield, and sports manufacturers such as Slazenger began to undercut his price with mass-produced equipment. Even Wingfield's entrepreneurial flair could not compete with the economies of production and marketing achieved by these specialists.<br>
<br>Wingfield died on 18 April 1912 at his London home, 33 St George's Square, Belgravia, of emphysema and bronchitis, from which he had suffered for many years. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. He was remembered by a statue in the foyer of the Lawn Tennis Association denoting him as the &#145;Inventor of Lawn Tennis&#146;.<br>
