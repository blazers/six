<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  Adye</span>  (1815&#150;1906), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, the son of Captain Henry Osborne Douglas, an army officer, and his wife, Eleanor Crabtree, was born at Thorpe, near Norwich, on 31 May 1815, and was intended for the navy. He was sent to school in Hampshire, and then to Caen, Normandy, for two years. On his return to England he was articled to a firm of solicitors in Southampton, and in 1838 was admitted to practice. He emigrated to Van Diemen's Land in 1839, and in the same year was admitted to the bar at Hobart. From 1840 to 1842, however, he and his brother were sheep farmers at Port Phillip (later Victoria). When he returned to Van Diemen's Land in 1842 he founded a legal firm in Launceston, and became one of the leading lawyers in the colony.<br>
<br>In 1853, on the introduction of a regular municipal administration for Launceston, Douglas became an alderman of the town, of which he was later mayor (1865&#150;6, 1880&#150;82). He remained alderman until 1884. About this time he won notice by his vigorous opposition to the system of transportation, which he regarded as a major obstacle to progress on the island. He was defeated at his first attempt to enter the legislative council, but in July 1855 was elected as member for Launceston, and moved to the house of assembly in 1856 under the new constitution. He actively promoted public works, particularly public water supplies and railways, and was successful despite stiff opposition, his most notable achievement being the building of the Launceston&#150;Deloraine railway.<br>
<br>From 1862 to 1870 Douglas represented Westbury in the house of assembly; in 1871&#150;2 he was member for Norfolk plains and from 1872 to 1884 for Fingal. On 15 August 1884 he became premier and chief secretary of Tasmania, and represented the island at the federal council of Australasia, a body which he had helped establish, and to which he expounded his vision of an Australasia independent of Britain. After a somewhat uneventful period of office he resigned on 8 March 1886 to go to England as first agent-general for the colony, an office he had established the previous year. In October 1887 he resigned his agency and returned to Tasmania.<br>
<br>From 1890 to 1904 Douglas was member for Launceston in the legislative council, and he represented Tasmania at the federal convention at Sydney in 1891. He served in the Dobson ministry as chief secretary from 17 August 1892 to 14 April 1894, when he became president of the legislative council; this position he held for ten years, and was knighted at the coronation of Edward VII in 1902. In May 1904 he was defeated at the elections for Launceston, and retired from public life.<br>
<br>Of striking personality, Douglas gave the impression of being brusque and unsympathetic, until he was better known. He was a good fighting leader, acute and tenacious in debate; an obituary in the Hobart <span class="italic">Mercury</span> referred to him as &#145;the central figure in the progressive movement&#146;  (11 April 1906). He was married four times. Of his first wife nothing is known, save that the couple had four children by the 1840s and that she had died by 10 July 1858, when Douglas married, in London, a widow, Martha Matilda Collins, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rolls. He married in Launceston on 18 January 1873 Charlotte Richards (1853/4&#150;1876), with whom he had a daughter. His fourth wife, Charlotte's sister Ida, he married in Adelaide on 6 October 1877. They had four sons and four daughters. Douglas died on 10 April 1906 at Ryehope, Davey Street, Hobart, which had been his home for ten years; after a service in St David's Anglican Cathedral, Hobart, he was buried at the city's Cornelian Bay cemetery.<br>
