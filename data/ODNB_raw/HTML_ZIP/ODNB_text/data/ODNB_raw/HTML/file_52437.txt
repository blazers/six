<span class="headword">Curr,  Edward</span>  (1798&#150;1850), <span class="occ">politician and entrepreneur in Australia</span>, was born on 1 July 1798 at Sheffield, England, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47990/', "John Curr")</script>, a coal viewer at the duke of Norfolk's estate and coalmines, and his wife, Hannah Wilson (1759&#150;1851). He was educated at Sedgley Park School and Ushaw College, and resisted parental pressure to enter a profession or move into business. His marriage to Elizabeth Micklethwait(e), daughter of Benjamin (1762&#150;1798) and Mary Micklethwaite of Ardsley, was accompanied by a generous financial settlement and this, together with a guarantee from his father, seems to have decided him on a commercial career in Van Diemen's Land. Edward and Elizabeth Curr arrived in Hobart in 1820. The patronage of Lieutenant-Governor William Sorell compensated for early business reversals and Curr was active in the foundation of Roman Catholic communities on the island. After the death of his father in 1823 he returned to England with his wife and children and completed a promotional publication, his <span class="italic">Account of the Colony of Van Diemen's Land</span> (1824). Sorell, also visiting England, helped to arrange Curr's appointment as chief agent of the Van Diemen's Land Company, and from his return in 1826 until 1842 Curr tried to secure the interests of the company in its tract of 350,000 acres in the north-west of the island.<br>
<br>The task required the co-ordination of practical exploration, the development of appropriate livestock breeding programmes, and the cultivation of influential contacts in a small community which resented the company's monopolistic claims. Curr's associates chastised him for his management performance and for his haughty demeanour towards local officials, and in 1839 the company's directors gave him a year's notice. He then took his family to the mainland, where he established his own pastoral business in the Port Phillip district of New South Wales. Leaving the affairs of his up-country properties to his sons, he became prominent in the political life of Melbourne. He was the first candidate to be nominated for Melbourne in the inaugural election for the New South Wales legislative council in 1843, but his adherence to Roman Catholicism stirred up fierce sectarianism and, narrowly defeated, he chose to identify more closely with Irish immigrant groups; ironically, he was later criticized for a marked want of deference to the predominantly Irish clergy. Towards the mid-1840s Curr, motivated by an apparent threat from radical Orangemen and other Port Phillip militants, was attracted by the demand that Port Phillip district be separated from New South Wales and made a distinct colony. He chaired the Separation League and lobbied vigorously in England and in the colonial press. In 1845 he was elected to the legislative council, but resigned after nine months because of the difficulty of attending its sittings in Sydney.<br>
<br>Curr was tall, powerfully built, resolute and resourceful, and was frequently embroiled in controversial disputes. He did not flinch from opposing the highest colonial authorities, and his commanding presence and clear statements of opinion were welcomed in many quarters. Occasionally his forceful personality diverted attention from his adoption of contradictory positions: for example, ignoring the views of urban supporters, he campaigned for the importation of convict labour to assist the pioneer pastoralists. He died on 16 November 1850, five days after the arrival of the news that parliament had passed the act separating the Port Phillip district, to form Victoria, and was buried in Melbourne general cemetery on the 19th. He left his wife and the surviving eleven of their fourteen children financially secure.<br>

<a name="cosubject_52437"></a><span class="headword">Edward Micklethwaite Curr</span>  (1820&#150;1889), <span class="occ">pastoralist and author</span>, was born on 25 December 1820 in Hobart, the eldest child of Edward and Elizabeth Curr. After an education at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire (1829&#150;37), and a year in France, he assisted his brother William in managing the family's properties in the Port Phillip district. In 1852&#150;4 he travelled in Europe and the Middle East, finishing in Ireland where on 31 January 1854 he married Margaret Vaughan (1830/31&#150;1886) from co. Kildare, who bore him five sons and three daughters. After returning to Victoria in that year, he worked in New Zealand and Queensland, before settling in Victoria again in 1862, when he was employed as an inspector of stock by the Victorian government; here his innovative contributions to the formulation and implementation of stock management policies proved critical in the consolidation of the pastoral frontier. His practical and scholarly interests were represented in <span class="italic">Pure Saddle Horses</span> (1863), <span class="italic">An Essay on Scab in Sheep</span> (1865), <span class="italic">Recollections of Squatting in Victoria</span> (1883), and a four-volume work, <span class="italic">The Australian Race: its Origins, Languages, Customs</span> (1886&#150;7). His later works are highly valued for their atypically sympathetic approach to the indigenous peoples. Far less active in colonial politics than his father, he died in Melbourne on 3 August 1889 and was buried in the Roman Catholic section of the St Kilda general cemetery, Melbourne. He had often complained that his father had invested too much of the family wealth in the cause of separation; more importantly, his published reflections on the impact of European occupation suggest that the son is the larger historical figure.<br>
