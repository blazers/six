<span class="headword">Nicholson,  Marjorie</span>  (1914&#150;1997), <span class="occ">socialist and trade unionist</span>, was born at 22 Cherryburn Gardens, Benwell, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 22 December 1914, the daughter of Edward Nicholson, manager of a hat factory, and his wife, Edith Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bone. Later the family moved to Kenton, Middlesex, and she was sent to Harrow high school. There she had an exemplary record, with high academic ratings leading to an open scholarship to read history at St Hilda's College, Oxford, the George Heelum scholarship, a Middlesex education committee senior county award, and another award from the Stapley Trust. As an undergraduate she was thus comfortably self-supporting and obtained second-class honours in modern history in 1936. By that time she had converted from the family tradition of Conservatism to socialism, and through the Oxford University Labour Club had met G. D. H. Cole and some of the leading young socialists such as Richard Crossman and Patrick Gordon Walker, then a don at Christ Church. She became committed to Indian independence and ultimately to self-government in the British colonial empire. On leaving Oxford she taught history at East Ham Grammar School for Girls and lectured for the Workers' Educational Association. By 1941 she had returned to Oxford as the organizing tutor in history for the Oxford delegacy in extra-mural studies in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire. Her political ambition increasing, she stood as a Labour candidate in the strongly Conservative constituency of Windsor in the first three general elections after the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1945 Nicholson joined the Fabian Colonial Bureau as assistant secretary. There she forged close, enduring friendships with Rita Hinden, the secretary, and Arthur Creech Jones, the former chairman, who was then under-secretary and within a year secretary of state for the colonies. Her talents for negotiation and for writing succinct articles on colonial political and economic issues emerged at this time. This was an exhilarating period to be at the hub of Labour's interest in colonial development. The government was funding research into constitutional and economic progress, the Colonial Office and other ministries were issuing much more information about colonial issues, and interchange of ideas with emergent political leaders in the colonies had been well established. In the office of the bureau she met many of those leaders, and over the years she conducted a considerable correspondence with them. In 1950, when Rita Hinden resigned to become editor of <span class="italic">Socialist Commentary</span> and Creech Jones, out of parliament, resumed his chairmanship of the bureau, Nicholson became its secretary. The bureau then was facing financial and organizational difficulties. To widen its outlook she introduced into its journal, <span class="italic">Venture</span>, more frequent signed articles and, following discussion there of the moral issues of trusteeship, issued a questionnaire on whether the prime aim of the Labour Party's colonial policy should be political, economic, or social development. On the basis of the responses to this questionnaire she submitted for further consideration a memorandum on long-term aims for Labour. Her own view was that the colonial governments should collaborate with nationalist leaders in breaking the dependence of colonial peoples on the ruling power.<br>
<br>After five years Nicholson, recognizing that the bureau no longer exercised its original influence in the Labour Party, transferred to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Commonwealth section to work on policy development. She maintained her relations with the bureau, attending its periodic conferences and writing for <span class="italic">Venture</span>. Nevertheless, direct contact with the politically active trade union leaders in the British dependencies, and the continuity of the TUC's work, distanced from the ebb and flow of parties in the British government, suited her better.<br>
<br>A love of fieldwork had been born in 1949, when the Fabians gave Nicholson three months' leave to conduct classes for adults in the Eastern Provinces of Nigeria. That course, on the making of modern nations, organized by the Oxford extra-mural studies delegacy, covered most of the problems facing colonies aspiring to independence, many of which were being explored in bureau pamphlets and all of them by colonial officials and academics. Every opportunity offered later by the TUC to observe and report on the relations between local governments overseas and the trade unions was welcomed. On further visits to Tanganyika in 1954 and to Nigeria in 1960 and 1970 the advice she gave to the unions, based on considered TUC policy, was not always what they had hoped to hear. Nevertheless, she respected their members' dignity and ability to decide what they wanted, and her aim was always to help them attain it through the constitutional methods provided by their union structure rather than through the oratory of unstable political pressure groups. In <span class="italic">New Fabian Colonial Essays</span> she argued that the initiative for political development lay with the colonial peoples, with Britain merely assisting, and that accepting the goal of self-government precluded the imposition of a specifically socialist policy. Her practical recommendations to the Commonwealth section committees on her return were based on stringent observation, experience, wide reading, and recognition of the colonial peoples' ultimate goals.<br>
<br>On retirement in 1972 Nicholson settled in St Albans and embarked on a scholarly study of the influence of the TUC overseas from 1916 to 1965. Unfortunately she died before the second volume was completed. Research for this work took her to India in 1973, thus fulfilling a lifelong ambition, and to the West Indies in 1976, where she met many old friends in positions of authority. While not allowing it to cloud her judgement, her appreciation of the scholarship and diverse talents of others was generous.<br>
<br>On 14 September 1946 Nicholson married Lionel Victor Van der Meulen Fowler (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), journalist, son of Henry Walter Willson Fowler, company secretary, and former husband of Constance Marjorie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips, from whom he was divorced; they themselves were later divorced. She was appointed MBE in 1969. She died of a subarachnoid haemorrhage at Hemel Hempstead General Hospital on 22 July 1997. A memorial service was held on 1 August in the parish church of St Michael, St Albans.<br>
