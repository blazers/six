<span class="headword">Peto <span class="st"> [Peyto]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1485&#150;1558), <span class="occ">cardinal</span>, was a younger son of Edward Peyto of Chesterton, Warwickshire, and Goditha Throckmorton (<i>d</i>. 1531), although it has been much more commonly said that &#145;the acts of his life were so obscure that in some respects Petow might be compared to Melchizedek, as no one knew who his parents were, nor where he was born&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1556&#150;7</i>, no. 937). One of four children, his brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75383/', "John Peyto")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72342/', "Peyto family")</script>]. After graduating BA at Oxford in 1502, Peto was incorporated in the following year at Cambridge, where he proceeded MA in 1505. In 1507/8 he was paid &pound;4 to lecture on mathematics, and seems to have become briefly a fellow of Queens' College in 1511 (probably through John Fisher's patronage), immediately before his ordination to the priesthood on 15 March that year. He had been incorporated MA at Oxford on 16 June 1510 and held the office of university preacher at Cambridge in 1510&#150;11. Peto was vice-warden of the Observant Franciscans at Richmond, Surrey, by December 1520, warden in 1522, and provincial minister of the Observants. In 1524 the Carthusians of Axholme presented him to the living of Sharnford, Leicestershire; he failed to keep the church in repair, which suggests that he did not reside.<br>
<br>Nothing further is known of Peto until the time of the divorce crisis, when he was again provincial and apparently also acting as confessor to Katherine of Aragon and her ladies, as well as to Princess Mary. He defended the queen, preaching a sermon before Henry at Easter 1532 in which he denounced those who repudiated their wives, threatened excommunication for the king since flatterers always ruined kingdoms, and observed that princes' affections obscured the truth. Nicholas Harpsfield later claimed that Peto had warned Henry that, like Ahab, dogs would lick his blood. An angry king summoned Peto before him, and Peto flatly told Henry that he would lose his kingdom because of his subjects' opposition. According to Sir George Throckmorton's confession of 1537, Peto offered Henry a detailed refutation of his case, arguing that he could have no other wife while Katherine lived unless he could prove that Prince Arthur had intercourse with her, something the king could not do, as the only evidence was Arthur's &#145;light word&#146; about having been &#145;in the midst of Spain&#146;. Peto also insisted that Henry could not marry Anne Boleyn, since he had &#145;meddled with the mother and the sister&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/2, no. 952), probably the origin of Nicholas Sander's famous canard to the same effect. Peto helped to organize parliamentary opposition to the divorce, telling Throckmorton to stay the course for his soul's sake, and in convocation attacked Richard Curwen for having preached in the convent of Greenwich without the brothers' permission&#151;Curwen had by royal order delivered a sermon confuting Peto.<br>
<br>The chronology of Peto's career becomes confusing after 1532. According to one story, he had asked and received Henry's permission to retire to Toulouse, but the king had changed his mind and had him arrested. Nevertheless, Peto seems to have reached the continent before returning to England. It is certain that when he accused Curwen he was in the custody of Bishop Standish (where he remained at least into May 1532) and that he was in the Franciscan house at Pontoise in January 1533. Most sources agree that during this time he had a book published in Antwerp (suppositiously at L&uuml;neburg) against the divorce, <span class="italic">Philalethae hyerborie &hellip; in Anticatoptrum suum &hellip; paresceve</span> (&#145;Lover of truth from the north &hellip;&#146;) a reply to <span class="italic">A Glasse of the Truthe</span>. Although the book cannot have been his, both because of the pseudonym and also because its author refers to himself as having studied in Paris, Peto was frequently accused of having written it. There is a single copy in the Grenville collection in the British Library. Peto and his companion Friar Henry Elston may have brought the work back to England, or perhaps they merely forwarded it.<br>
<br>Once Peto had fled, various English agents, especially John Hutton, ambassador to the court of Mary of Hungary in the Low Countries, kept a close eye on him. In 1533 and 1534 he was in Antwerp in company with Elston, who was spreading the rumour that Spain was about to invade England. Stephen Vaughan, Thomas Cromwell's representative in the Low Countries, who once solemnly proclaimed that he would capture Peto, whom he called &#145;a hypocrite, a tiger clad in a sheepskin, a perilous knave&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 6, no. 1324), wrote in March 1535 that Peto was at Bergen-op-Zoom (where he seems mainly to have stayed during the rest of his time in the Netherlands) and that Mary would have him arrested if Henry wrote to her personally. Peto was variously said to be supported by the Spanish or from England, and seems to have kept very close ties with home, notably with Sir Thomas More, who sent him several books including his own <span class="italic">Confutation of Tyndale's &#145;Answer&#146;</span>.<br>
<br>Two years later, in 1537, Peto was involved in one of the more curious episodes in Reginald Pole's first legation against England. Hutton had recruited one William Vaughan, offering him a pardon in exchange for insinuating himself with Pole. Vaughan had a letter of introduction from Peto to his relative Michael Throckmorton. Pole greeted Vaughan cordially, according to Hutton, as a fellow exile and Welshman, gave him money and asked him to go to Antwerp to gather news. He left with a letter for Peto from Throckmorton. This may have been Peto's first contact with Pole, of whom he would later be described as one of the principal followers. He acted as go-between for Hutton with Throckmorton, Pole's representative, and often conferred with Hutton in person. Peto helped to cover Pole's escape from Flanders, possibly on the latter's instructions, recommending to Hutton that Nicholas Wilson be sent on the king's behalf to confer with Pole &#145;to stop such things as were likely to be put forth shortly&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/124, fol. 167<i>r</i>), probably a reference to the planned publication of Pole's <span class="italic">Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione</span>, which borrowed Peto's argument that flattery was at the root of Henry's actions. Peto probably had a copy, although Pole denied any knowledge of it. It apparently reached Hutton, who burnt it.<br>
<br>Peto still held out hope that the change in the pope's status in England was not permanent, and at least as late as December 1537, after Pole had returned to Rome, offered his allegiance to the king and his service to Cromwell, and said he would try to prevent the publication of a book against Henry, probably another reference to <span class="italic">Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione</span>. About the same time, Peto told Hutton that if peace were concluded and a council called, he would go to Italy, but that he found many abuses among monks and nuns in England and thought the monasteries could be put to better uses. Thus except for the status of the pope, Peto wished he were in England. Shortly afterwards, however, Peto acted on his resolve to go to Italy, encountering Hutton's brother-in-law at Mainz as he made his way in secular attire to Rome. In August 1538 Peto was in the Observant convent at Venice, &#145;by Mr Pole's means&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/1, no. 115), and he spent the winter there, Thomas Theobald describing him as &#145;somewhat babbling and very open&#146;  (Ellis, 2.128). He stayed against his wishes, since he had wanted to go to Rome, but had been prevented by the Franciscan general's orders. Pole wrote on Peto's behalf, asking the general to give Peto permission to join Pole whenever he chose.<br>
<br>This was now Peto's only good option, since he had been indicted for having traitorously gone to Rome, and then included in the massive bill of attainder against Pole and his allies of 19 May 1539. On 30 March 1543 Paul III nominated Peto as bishop of Salisbury with Marcello Cervini as referendary, after Pole had refused the see four years earlier. Henry did not recognize the election, and by the time Pole was in a position to implement it in 1555 Peto no longer wished to have the see and never took possession. He next became successively a chamberlain and warden of the English Hospice in Rome in 1544; he last appears as warden in November 1548. A gap of six years ensues until Peto appears in a Franciscan house in Mantua, according to the somewhat garbled testimony of the Mantuan envoy to the imperial court. It may have been thence that he wrote to Mary Tudor, probably in early 1554, advising her to remain single, supporting his argument with numerous quotations from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and warning her that she would be dominated by her husband and suffer dangerous pregnancies. Peto offered to come to England to tell the queen more.<br>
<br>On 4 January 1555 Peto's attainder was reversed, and by then he had probably returned home. Once there, he led the attempt to destroy Christ's Hospital, which had been founded on the site of the Greyfriars' convent in London, until persuaded to abandon his efforts by the intervention of the Spanish Friar John, probably Juan de Villagarcia. In November 1555 he was among twenty-five friars in the restored convent of Greenwich, and was possibly correctly identified as Mary's confessor and certainly incorrectly as a recent nominee for cardinal. That did not occur until 14 June 1557 when Paul IV, acting out of divine inspiration, or so he claimed, surprised the whole College of Cardinals; the pope did not even give Peto a cardinal's title. More importantly, Paul did transfer to him Pole's legation to England. Sir Edward Carne, Mary's ambassador in Rome, rejected the nomination of a &#145;blockhead&#146; and a dotard, and told the pope that he would have to report the news to the queen himself. Paul replied that Peto had been a great help to the congregation of the Inquisition (under unknown circumstances), and that he was certain Peto had been Mary's confessor despite Carne's attempt to prove he was not. Other observers put the nomination bluntly down to Paul's proceedings against Pole for heresy.<br>
<br>The pope's nomination, dated 20 June, went off to England on the 28th. Within a month Peto wrote back rejecting the appointment as legate, although Mary had refused to allow the courier to cross from Calais where he was put up at royal expense, and tried to keep the news from Pole. When the latter found out, he sought entry for the messenger. Carne secured a papal audience to present Peto's and the queen's letters, and Paul replied that the matter needed consultation with the cardinals. Peto's letter was read under the strictest secrecy in consistory on 12 August, but the absence of four leading imperialist cardinals gave the pope an excuse for further delay. In December Paul tried to summon Peto to Rome via Cardinal Carlo Carafa, probably to make it appear that the general summons of cardinals was not merely a cover to get Pole into the pope's hands. Peto may have formally resigned his bishopric in early 1558 and probably died late in the year. He was still alive and in England shortly before 17 November, when he attended the deathbed of Pole's brother Geoffrey.<br>
