<span class="headword">Kieft,  Cyril William</span>  (1911&#150;2004), <span class="occ">industrialist and motor engineer</span>, was born at 8 Park Road, Gorseinon, Llandeilo Tal-y-bont, Swansea, on 27 September 1911, the son of Albert William Kieft, steel works manager, and his wife, Lilian Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans. He was educated at Wellington School, Somerset, where he excelled at shooting, winning several cups in competitions at Bisley. Upon leaving school, he followed his father into the steel industry and trained at Richard Thomas and Baldwin, where his father was managing director. In 1933 he was appointed assistant plant manager at the Redbourne steel works, near Scunthorpe, in Lincolnshire. Four years later in 1937 he and his father restarted the Haybridge steel works at Wellington, Shropshire, with Cyril as assistant managing director. On 15 September that year he married Megan Thomas, 23-year-old daughter of David John Thomas, a south Wales colliery owner, at St James's Chapel of Ease in Swansea. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Kieft served as a bomb disposal officer in the Home Guard while continuing as assistant managing director of the Haybridge steel works, which made steel sections for the war effort. However, in 1943 he moved to become managing director of the Wolverhampton steel works and also bought a drop forgings company and a steel pressing company which he ran on his own account. The drop forgings company was situated in Derry Street, Wolverhampton. In 1946, with the threat of nationalization of the steel industry by the then Labour government, Kieft expressed the view that he did not want to become a civil servant and set up a manufacturing engineering company in Bridgend in his native south Wales.<br>
<br>Throughout his career in the steel industry, Kieft harboured an interest in racing cars. Prior to the outbreak of war in 1939 he attended race meetings at Donington and in 1948 he decided to enter the sport as a manufacturer. His chosen category was formula 3 where entry costs were low, as the car engines were based on 500 cc motorcycle engines. Kieft's initial sally into the sport was participation in the Tenby motor club's hill climb event at Lydstep House, Pembrokeshire. A year later in 1949 Kieft entered a Marwin, a modified rear-engined Austin 7, in the same event, but the vehicle was considered too heavy to be competitive. When Marwin went into liquidation later that year, Kieft bought key components from the receiver and proceeded to design and construct his own cars at his factory in Wolverhampton. The first Kieft prototype vehicle raced at Lydstep in spring 1950, but the experience was such that Kieft decided to end his driving career and subsequently always employed professional drivers.<br>
<br>After competing in several events in 1950 Kieft took two of his cars to Montlh&eacute;ry where they broke fourteen different speed records. Kieft though was searching for a top-class driver and identified Stirling Moss, who at that time was working for Cooper's, a rival firm. Moss and a number of partners were also interested in designing and manufacturing their own cars, but lacked the necessary capital. Kieft recognized the potential of Moss's cars and offered the necessary manufacturing facilities. The ensuing car was launched in 1951 and won its first competition at Goodwood with Moss at the controls. Over the next two years Kieft cars won a number of victories with Don Parker, another &#145;privateer&#146;, including the formula 3 championship on three successive occasions. The Kieft car in which Parker won these titles was exhibited at the Earl's Court motor show in recognition of Parker's success.<br>
<br>Regardless of his achievements in racing, Kieft continued to run his engineering business, but relocated his factory from south Wales to Wolverhampton. Additionally, he also formed the Welsh Motor Racing Club and built a race circuit on Swansea's outskirts at Fairwood Common. In 1953 and 1954 the production of Kieft cars continued with new designs and a variety of engine sizes, including one which competed at Le Mans in 1954 as well as a formula 1 car which remained hidden until nearly fifty years later, when it was unveiled for the first time. In addition to simply producing cars, Kieft was an innovator in car design, particularly in the use of glass fibres to reduce weight, the development of central seating positions for drivers, and the adoption of swing axles in his vehicles, so making a distinct contribution to racing car development in the early 1950s.<br>
<br>Kieft was closely involved with the Conservative government in 1953 when it began to denationalize the steel industry, and worked with the merchant bankers Close Brothers to that effect. In 1955 he began to concentrate his energies on his steel and manufacturing interests and sold Kieft Cars, which continued to trade under various names until 1961. Kieft then proceeded to diversify his industrial interests with the setting up of Kieft Oil Products and Drop Forgings. He was also managing director of Raine Co., of Newcastle upon Tyne; Millom Askham and Hodbarrow, of Cumbria; and Darwyn and Mostyn, of north Wales. In the 1960s he became managing director of the Arusha group, and in the following decade both managing director and a major shareholder in the Wrexham Wire Company.<br>
<br>Kieft pursued several hobbies, building up a collection of Swansea and Nantgarw porcelain, on which he was a recognized expert, as well as being an avid stamp collector, specializing in British Empire issues. Additionally, in 1961 he purchased a 51 foot yacht which he used to cruise around Britain and the Mediterranean, and also became a member of the Royal Yacht Club. His interest in motor racing was rekindled in the 1960s and he began watching racing again, but mainly on television. Nevertheless he was always happy to answer queries from enthusiasts about Kieft Cars, and on a number of occasions participated in the 500 Owners Association (for owners of 500 cc racing cars). His proudest moment came in September 2002 when the Kieft formula 1 car which had been built almost fifty years earlier was finally unveiled at Silverstone. The car was fitted with a 2.5 litre Coventry Climax FPE engine and competed in the Boulogne and Hawthorn trophies meeting. Following the race Kieft sat in the cockpit with a glass of champagne. After his wife's death he moved to Spain. He died on 10 May 2004, and was survived by his two daughters.<br>
