<span class="headword">Park,  William <span class="st"> [Willie]</span>, junior</span>  (1864&#150;1925), <span class="occ">golfer and golf course architect</span>, was born at 52 High Street, Musselburgh, on 4 February 1864, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102422/', "William (Willie) Park senior (1833&#150;1903)")</script>, golf professional and maker of golf balls and clubs, and his wife, Susannah Law (1837&#150;1922), who had a family of five sons and five daughters. The Park family of Musselburgh was one of several eminent Scottish golfing families of the nineteenth century. Willie Park senior won the first ever open championship, at Prestwick in 1860, and subsequently won three further open titles, all at Prestwick, in 1863, 1866, and 1875. His brother Mungo Park (1836&#150;1904) also won an open championship, at Musselburgh in 1874. From as early as his seventh year Willie junior learned both the game of golf and the art of making golf clubs from his father and elder brother, and honed his putting skills playing for marbles with anyone who would agree to play with him. When not at school he would surreptitiously creep into his father's workshop and borrow the tools of one of the workers to practise making club heads.<br>
<br>Park played in the open championship for the first time in 1880, at the age of sixteen: he won the title twice, at Prestwick in 1887 and at Musselburgh in 1889, and finished second to Harry Vardon at Prestwick in 1898. His last appearance in the championship was in 1910. During this period, with few recognized competitions, professional golfers frequently played challenge matches against other professionals for substantial money stakes: Park had a standing challenge, as did his father before him, to play anyone in the world for a wager of &pound;100. The normal practice was to play such matches over two nominated courses, home and away, and several notable golfers picked up the gauntlet, including Willie Fernie, Ben Sayers, and John Henry Taylor, all of whom Park defeated. In 1894, however, he lost to Douglas Rolland at Sandwich over thirty-six holes, and five years later was heavily beaten by Harry Vardon in a celebrated 72-hole challenge match sparked by Park's near miss in the open the previous year. A crowd of 10,000 watched Park hold Vardon to a lead of two holes over North Berwick, but on his home course at Ganton the Englishman pulled away to win by eleven up with ten to play.<br>
<br>Through his experience as a professional golfer and the knowledge he had gained at his father's workshop Park became an excellent designer and maker of golf clubs. Among a number of patented designs was a &#145;bulger&#146; made with a convex face to reduce the spin on the ball as a result of a mishit. He also brought out a &#145;lofter&#146;, of which over 17,000 were sold at 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. each, and, in 1891, a patented wry-necked putter. Park himself was generally recognized as the best putter of his day, and would practise this aspect of his game for many hours at a time. His celebrated dictum, that &#145;a man who can putt is a match for anyone&#146;, reflected the confidence of a golfer seldom known to miss from within 6 feet. In the early days of golf-ball design, the patterns on gutta-percha (&#145;gutty&#146;) balls were many and varied, and Park experimented first with a diamond-mesh pattern in 1890 and then, in 1894, a hexagonal pattern entitled The Royal, designed to slow down the roll of the ball on the putting greens.<br>
<br>None the less, Park's most lasting fame has been his reputation as a golf-course designer. He first laid out courses with his father and uncle, before branching out on his own. His personal tally is at least 160 different course designs worldwide, including over forty in the USA (Park himself claimed seventy, many of which have not survived), around twenty in Canada, over ninety in Great Britain and Ireland, and three on the continent of Europe. Royal Antwerp in Belgium and Royal Quebec, Royal Montreal, and Mount Bruno in Canada were among his major designs overseas, and in Britain his major work was at Carnoustie, Huntercombe, the Nottinghamshire club at Hollinwell, and (perhaps most famously of all) at Sunningdale in Berkshire. While working at Sunningdale in 1900 Park formed Chiltern Estates Ltd to buy the land and develop the property for the Huntercombe course, near Henley-on-Thames. He invested &pound;5000 of the &pound;25,000 authorized capital, of which &pound;11,200 was issued. It was one of the first golf courses planned to include a housing development, now standard practice worldwide. Park was appointed managing director of the company, as well as the promoter, but the housing scheme never came to fruition, and the project almost ruined him financially.<br>
<br>In 1896 Park wrote <span class="italic">The Game of Golf</span>, the first golfing book written by a professional golfer, and he followed this in 1920 with <span class="italic">The Art of Putting</span>, part of which is autobiographical. He also wrote occasionally for <span class="italic">Golf Illustrated</span> and <span class="italic">Golf Monthly</span>, and judged the entries at the golf exhibition of 1910.<br>
<br>On 18 November 1886 Park married Mary Taylor Syme but his wife died in 1887, after the birth of a daughter, Rebecca. He subsequently married Margaret Sinclair Inglis (<i>d</i>. 1943) on 15 October 1895; she was the daughter of John Inglis, spirit merchant. They had one son, who died at eight years of age of diphtheria, and four daughters, one of whom, Meta, died of peritonitis aged seven. Park himself was taken fatally ill while working in Canada in December 1924 and was taken home to Musselburgh. He died at Craighouse, Edinburgh, on 22 May 1925. Warmly praised by contemporaries for his courage, temperance, hard work, and devotion to his family, Park gained a brilliant reputation as a course designer which remains intact. Sir Guy Campbell thought him the doyen of all golf course designers, and believed that Park set the standard for all who followed him.<br>
