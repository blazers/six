<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ferrier,  Susan Edmonstone</span>  (1782&#150;1854), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 7 September 1782 in Edinburgh, the ninth of the ten surviving children of James Ferrier (1744&#150;1829), writer to the signet, and his wife, Helen (1741&#150;97), daughter of Robert Coutts, a farmer near Montrose. James Ferrier, who came from Linlithgow, had a legal practice in Edinburgh and included John, fifth duke of Argyll among his clients and friends; his appointment as principal clerk of session in 1802 owed much to Argyll's influence. In 1784 Ferrier and his family moved from Lady Stair's Close, where Susan was probably born, to 11 George Street, a house in the Georgian New Town. Susan Ferrier was educated at home, and as her father was well established in Edinburgh's close-knit society, she and his other children came to know many of its notable figures, not least Sir Walter Scott and Henry Mackenzie.<br>
<br>James Ferrier frequently went to Inveraray on Argyll's business, and in 1797 he took Susan on her first visit. Large house parties were often held there and the duke's daughters, Lady Augusta Clavering and Lady Charlotte Campbell (later Lady Charlotte Bury), encouraged private theatricals and the production of a weekly journal. Susan Ferrier became a close friend of the family and in particular of the duke's granddaughter, Charlotte Clavering, with whom she maintained a lively correspondence. By about 1810 they had decided to co-operate in writing a novel, but a major obstacle to this project was the difference in style and ability of the two authors. The novel, eventually published as <span class="italic">Marriage</span> in 1818, was wholly Susan Ferrier's work except for &#145;The History of Mrs Douglas&#146;, which was contributed by Charlotte Clavering. However, their letters show that Charlotte provided encouragement and criticism throughout, reading passages to Lady Charlotte Campbell and reporting her delighted reaction. William Blackwood, to whom Susan Ferrier sent the unfinished manuscript in 1817, was also enthusiastic, though he offered only &pound;150 for the copyright. The novel was published anonymously and, although a few people guessed the author's identity, Susan Ferrier denied authorship. It was an immediate success, the lively humour and social satire having great appeal. The author had a sharp eye for the foibles of human nature and several of her more eccentric characters such as Lady Maclaughlan and the three aunts at Glenfern Castle were based on real people. Charlotte Clavering had already recognized Lady Maclaughlan's dress as that of the sculptress Anne Seymour Damer, and her manners as those of Lady Frederick Campbell.<br>
<br>After the death of her mother and the marriages of her three elder sisters, Susan Ferrier remained at home to keep house for her father. As was the custom, they would take a house on the outskirts of Edinburgh during the summer months, and it was in East Morningside House that she wrote much of <span class="italic">The Inheritance</span>, published by Blackwood in 1824. By now, the author's identity was more widely known, but she genuinely wished to remain anonymous. Writing to her sister Helen Kinloch in 1823 she said<blockquote>I never will avow myself, and nothing can hurt or offend me so much as any of my friends doing it for me; this is not <i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>, but my real and unalterable feeling. I could not bear the <i>fuss</i> of authorism! (Ferrier, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 178)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">The Inheritance</span> was enthusiastically received; Scott, Henry Mackenzie and his daughters, Francis Jeffrey, Basil Hall, and the Argyll family all expressed their delight. Her friends were able to recognize James Ferrier in the character of Uncle Adam Ramsay, and others who read the novel enjoyed speculating on the identity of the characters. &#145;<i>Everybody</i> knows who the characters are, but no two people can agree about them. I have heard of five or six Lord Rossvilles and as many Miss Pratts&#146;  (Ferrier, <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 180). Appreciation of the work was not confined to Scotland; an American edition and a French translation both appeared in 1824 and a Swedish translation in 1836.<br>
<br>The publication of Susan Ferrier's third novel, <span class="italic">Destiny</span>, in 1831 owed much to her friendship with Scott. She had visited him at Ashestiel in 1811 and again at Abbotsford in 1829 and 1831. They evidently enjoyed each other's company: she thought him delightful, and he wrote of her &#145;This gifted personage besides having great talents has conversation the least exigeant of any author, female at least &hellip;, simple, full of humour, and exceedingly ready at repartee, and all this without the least affectation of the blue stocking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 654). Lockhart recorded her tact in helping the ageing Scott over his lapses of memory. Her account of these visits was published posthumously in volume 40 of <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span> (1874). She dedicated <span class="italic">Destiny</span> to Scott and it was he who advised her to break with Blackwood and who helped her brother to negotiate publication by Robert Cadell at the greatly enhanced fee of &pound;1700. Thirteen years had passed since the appearance of <span class="italic">Marriage</span>, and while <span class="italic">Destiny</span> retains the element of caricature in the figure of the minister Mr M'Dow, its tone is more didactic than that of the earlier novels. Social satire and the mockery of vulgarity have given way to a moralizing approach, reflecting the author's maturer interests. Although it did not prove as popular as <span class="italic">Marriage</span>, <span class="italic">Destiny</span> was well received and appealed to readers as diverse as Joanna Baillie and the lord advocate, Andrew Rutherfurd. All three novels are rather weakly plotted, their success lying mainly in the author's keen eye for the ridiculous and her entertaining portrait of Scottish society. Her letters reveal her own tastes in literature: she admired Jane Austen and Scott (though she had reservations about some of his works), but condemned Galt and Lockhart. In 1836, Robert Thorburn painted a miniature, intended to show her as she was about 1812; this was one of his early commissions and he kept in touch with her even after he had established himself successfully in London.<br>
<br>In 1841 Susan Ferrier sold the copyrights on her novels to Richard Bentley, who brought out new, illustrated editions. To her annoyance, <span class="italic">Marriage</span> did not include her revisions, and she disliked the illustrations. Eleven years later she gave him permission to publish a new edition, the first under her name, on condition that her revisions were incorporated and some of the illustrations removed. Bentley also tried to persuade her to write another novel, but in vain. She had already made several unsuccessful attempts at the request of a friend in 1837. The surviving chapters of a work entitled &#145;Maplehurst Manor&#146; probably date from that period. Her eyes had been troubling her for some time and towards the end of her life she spent much of her time in a darkened room, but still managed to keep up some cheerful correspondence with her family and friends. Her life had always been quiet; her devoted care for her father and her own poor health discouraged her from travel, though she made occasional visits to friends and relatives in Scotland, and a few to London. Otherwise, she spent her life in Edinburgh, becoming more secluded as her health deteriorated, but maintaining an interest in literature and the church. Like most of her family, she had been a member of the Church of Scotland, but she joined the Free Church after the Disruption of 1843. She died in her brother's house at 38 Albany Street, Edinburgh, on 5 November 1854, and was buried in the family grave in St Cuthbert's churchyard.<br>
