<span class="headword">Clavi&egrave;re,  &Eacute;tienne</span>  (1735&#150;1793), <span class="occ">political writer and financier</span>, was born in Geneva on 29 January 1735, the son of Jean-Jacques Clavi&egrave;re (1704&#150;1776), a linen merchant originally from the Dauphin&eacute;, in south-east France, and Jeanne-Elisabeth Rapillard, from Lausanne. As a young man Clavi&egrave;re was apprenticed to a Bavarian merchant firm and then to a trading and banking business part-owned by his family. In 1758 he married his cousin Marthe Louise Garnier-Hugue from Marseilles who brought him a dowry of 30,000 French livres; their daughter, Jeanne-Jos&eacute;phine, was born in 1761. Clavi&egrave;re came to prominence in Geneva as part of the <i>repr&eacute;sentant</i> movement that attacked the dominance of a corrupting &eacute;lite oligarchy, and its impact on Genevan politics, public morality, and the Calvinist religion. Clavi&egrave;re and his associates, Jacques-Antoine Duroveray and Fran&ccedil;ois d'Ivernois, were principally concerned with the historic &#145;guarantee&#146; of Geneva's constitution by Bern, Zurich, and France that permitted mediators to intervene at times of political crisis&#151;a situation they feared was open to exploitation by France. From 1770 he was a member of the <i>conseil des deux cents</i> and of the commission established to provide a new law code for the city. When, in February 1782, the <i>repr&eacute;sentants</i> took up arms against the magistrates Clavi&egrave;re, along with Duroveray, was regarded as one of the movement's leaders. Following the uprising's suppression in July, he fled the city and, along with other <i>repr&eacute;sentants</i>, was sentenced to permanent exile.<br>
<br>With his fellow exiles Clavi&egrave;re went first to the Prussian protectorate of Neuch&acirc;tel. Here he became acquainted with the French <i>parlementaires</i> Jacques-Pierre Brissot and the comte de Mirabeau, whom he employed to write in support of the <i>repr&eacute;sentant</i> cause. Clavi&egrave;re and the <i>repr&eacute;sentants</i> also considered the establishment of a New Geneva, following invitations from across Europe and further afield to establish a trading community of political exiles. A decision was taken to move to Waterford in Ireland, with the full support of the British prime minister, Lord Shelburne, and the lord lieutenant of Ireland, the third Earl Temple. Clavi&egrave;re moved to Waterford to participate in the project and, despite its failure after two years, he became a British subject, taking an oath to George III at Dublin. While his associates Duroveray and d'Ivernois moved to London, Clavi&egrave;re travelled to Paris in December 1784 to further his commercial career, becoming well known for his successful investments on the Paris bourse.<br>
<br>Clavi&egrave;re's business activities did not distract him from political and economic reform projects. He was involved in the writing of Mirabeau's <span class="italic">Consid&eacute;rations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus</span>, which was translated into English in 1785 by the politician and legal reformer Samuel Romilly, an associate of D'Ivernois, and also in the writing of Mirabeau's <span class="italic">Doutes sur la libert&eacute; de l'Escaut, reclam&eacute;e par l'empereur</span>, which appeared in the same year. These works considered the prospects for perpetual peace in Europe based on an alliance between Britain and France and were significant in the successful campaign to establish a commercial treaty between the two countries negotiated by William Eden in 1786. Though resident in Paris Clavi&egrave;re was involved, along with his fellow Genevans in London, with a group of British political reformers and intellectuals centred on Lord Shelburne (from 1786 first marquess of Lansdowne). Clavi&egrave;re's point of contact was Charles Stanhope, Lord Mahon (from 1786 third Earl Stanhope), whom he had known since the mid-1760s when the Stanhope family had lived in Geneva. Prominent members of the group&#151;known as the Bowood circle after Lansdowne's Wiltshire residence&#151;included Romilly, the diplomatist Benjamin Vaughan, Joseph Priestley, Richard Price, and the Genevans D'Ivernois, Duroveray, and &Eacute;tienne Dumont, who had taken up the position of tutor in Lansdowne's household. Those close to Lansdowne believed in the superiority, if not the perfection, of the British constitution relative to comparable monarchies (notably France), and in the universality of political liberty and political economy in different European states. They shared a desire for peace between Britain and France and thought this achievable through free trade between nations. As Eden's commercial treaty was not deemed a success, in 1787 Clavi&egrave;re (with Brissot) established the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Gallo-Am&eacute;ricaine. This was intended to break Britain's mercantile system, which he regarded as corrupting, by means of a commercial alliance between France and the United States.<br>
<br>In the final years of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> Clavi&egrave;re criticized the financial policies of his compatriot Jacques Necker, Louis XVI's director-general of finances, for his support of the Genevan magistrates. Clavi&egrave;re promoted his own financial reform projects and, with the coming of the revolution, these were developed through numerous publications, including articles in Mirabeau's newspaper, the <span class="italic">Courier de Provence</span>. Clavi&egrave;re was now reunited with Duroveray and Dumont as part of a Paris-based <i>atelier de Mirabeau</i>. Together they began to use Mirabeau to pressurize Necker into abandoning the French guarantee of Geneva's constitution. Following a second rising in Geneva in January 1789 Clavi&egrave;re's exile was overturned and he was invited to return to his former position as a member of the <i>conseil des deux cents</i>. Unlike many compatriots, Clavi&egrave;re remained in Paris and entered the legislative assembly as a deputy for the Seine. In the Girondin ministries he served as minister responsible for public finances, from March to June 1792, and from August 1792 until June 1793.<br>
<br>While serving as a minister Clavi&egrave;re was accused by many Genevans, including some former friends, of seeking to annex the city state to the French republic. On 2 June 1793 he and other Girondins were arrested and Clavi&egrave;re was accused in several Jacobin pamphlets of being a British spy. This accusation continued to be levelled during the 1790s and afterwards. By 13 June it was reported in the British press that Clavi&egrave;re had escaped custody and on 17 July that the former minister had come to London. A report in <span class="italic">The Times</span> for the following day noted that Clavi&egrave;re was resident at 57 Tottenham Court Road, London, &#145;until he can find asylum in the country near town&#146;. This and other reports (<span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, 18 July) noted Clavi&egrave;re's earlier naturalization and questioned whether the &#145;privileges of an English Citizen&#146; and the &#145;protection of our Government&#146; should be afforded to someone who had signed Louis XVI's death warrant. Clavi&egrave;re was back in France less than two months later and on 18 September was reported to have been handed over to the revolutionary tribunal  (<span class="italic">Lloyd's Evening Post</span>, 5 September). Clavi&egrave;re committed suicide in prison on 8 December 1793, reputedly by stabbing himself in the heart. One of Clavi&egrave;re's last letters was to Earl Stanhope, who was then in negotiation with the French envoy, Charles Talleyrand, in an effort to end the war between their respective countries. Fittingly, it once more raised the issue of peace between Britain and France.<br>
