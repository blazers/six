<span class="headword">Mather,  Richard</span>  (1596&#150;1669), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was born in Lowton, within present-day Liverpool, son of Thomas Mather and his wife, Margarite Abrams, of whom little is known except that they were modest landowners. Mather attended the nearby grammar school at Winwick until, in 1611, the master there, William Horrock, recommended his pupil to be teacher at a newly organized school at neighbouring Toxteth Park. Here Mather was profoundly influenced by the pious puritan Edward Aspinwall and his family, with whom he boarded, and experienced his own spiritual conviction in 1614.<br>
<br>In 1618 Mather matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, but his experience there was unhappy, and he left within a few months to return to Toxteth Park, now as the minister in a newly built chapel. He was ordained in March 1619 by Thomas Morton, bishop of Chester. On 29 September 1624 Mather married Katharine (<i>d</i>. 1655), daughter of Edmund Holt of Bury, Lancashire. The couple purchased a house at Much Woolton and while there had three sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18326/', "Samuel Mather")</script> (<i>b</i>. 13 May 1626), Timothy (<i>b</i>. 1628), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18323/', "Nathaniel Mather")</script> (<i>b</i>. 20 March 1630). In 1633 Mather was suspended after a frank exchange of views with Archbishop Richard Neile's visitor, who is said to have remarked: &#145;What &hellip; preach fifteen years and never wear a Surpless? It had been better for him that he had gotten Seven Bastards&#146;  (Mather, 27).<br>
<br>Having read of the recent experiments of puritans in Massachusetts with a congregational form of church polity, the Mathers decided to emigrate to New England; they reached Boston, Massachusetts, in 1635. They settled at Dorchester, where they had two more sons, Eleazar (<i>b</i>. 13 May 1637) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18322/', "Increase Mather (1639&#150;1723)")</script>. The local church was in its infancy. From his arrival Mather played a leading role in shaping Congregationalism, a role all the more remarkable because he alone of the leading ministers was without a university degree. The early years were contentious. Recent scholarship has emphasized the different views represented by John Cotton's emotional &#145;spiritism&#146; and Thomas Shepard's logical intellectualism. Mather's particular genius was a knack for expressing arcane matters plainly and the ability to find a middle ground between the positions of brilliant and opinionated fellow clergymen. Not only did Mather reconcile their disputes, but he navigated between what his learned colleagues wanted and the often very different expectations of the lay members of churches.<br>
<br>The proof of Mather's growing stature among both the ministers and the governing magistrates was their use of him in the 1630s and 1640s to respond to inquiries from England about the new polity. Criticisms by Charles Herle, a former neighbour of Mather's, Samuel Rutherford, the Scottish apologist, and others who favoured a presbyterian polity, were countered in three responses published in London which served to define and justify the New England church and its congregationalist autonomy&#151;<span class="italic">Church-Government and Church Covenant Discussed</span> (1643), <span class="italic">A Modest and Brotherly Answer to Mr. Charles Herle</span> (1644), and <span class="italic">A Reply to Mr. Rutherfurd</span> (1646). However, another, non-political side of Mather is evidenced by his contributions to <span class="italic">The Whole Book of Psalms</span> (1640), soon known as <span class="italic">The Bay Psalm Book</span>, the first book printed in English America, at the press in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It comprised translations of psalms from the Hebrew into metred English verse, so that they could be sung, after a fashion, in the puritan church services.<br>
<br>None the less Mather's most important achievement by far was to provide the working draft for the results of a synod in 1646, printed in 1649 on the Cambridge press as <span class="italic">A Platform of Church-Discipline</span>, and known since as the Cambridge <span class="italic">Platform</span>. Although a full third of the house of deputies voted against its adoption, possibly because in it the lay brothers and sisters lost authority to the elders, the Massachusetts general court adopted the <span class="italic">Platform</span> as an advisory model, and it became the standard description of the New England way. Mather's text reveals his own characteristic gentleness and leniency: &#145;The weakest measure of faith is to be accepted in those that desire to be admitted into the church. &hellip; Severity of examination is to be avoyded&#146;  (Walker, <span class="italic">Creeds</span>, 222).<br>
<br>Mather's first wife, Katharine, having died in Dorchester in March 1655, he married on 26 August 1656 John Cotton's widow, Sarah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hawkridge and widow, first, of John Story), thus uniting two of the most influential families in New England. Richard Mather's fifth son, Increase, later married Sarah Cotton's daughter Maria, and their eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18321/', "Cotton Mather (1663&#150;1728)")</script>.<br>
<br>Richard Mather had always argued for leniency in regard to baptism, and he pleaded for open baptism to the children of non-members, of whom his son Timothy was one, if at least one of their grandparents was a church member. At a synod in 1662 this issue was fiercely debated. John Davenport, the last surviving great figure of Mather's own generation, and Mather's son Increase both opposed him, but the change won out among the ministers present, and the proposal, known ever since as the half-way covenant, passed, although it brought a storm of disapproval from lay members and was not generally adopted for another generation. In this as in parts of the Cambridge <span class="italic">Platform</span> Richard Mather was less puritanical than the general population.<br>
<br>In the 1660s Mather's health deteriorated. He lost the sight of one eye, his hearing failed, and he suffered from kidney stones. In 1669, while moderating one of the most contentious church disputes in New England history, one that resulted from the call of John Davenport from New Haven to the First Church of Boston, Mather collapsed. Within the week, on 22 April 1669, he died from the stoppage of urine, while in bed at home. He was buried in Dorchester. He was survived by his wife.<br>
