<span class="headword">Mead,  George Robert Stow</span>  (1863&#150;1933), <span class="occ">theosophist and writer on gnosticism and Christian origins</span>, was born on 22 March 1863 at 2 Montague Cottages, Albert Grove, Peckham, London, the son of Robert Mead, then a lieutenant with the Military Staff College, and his wife, Mary Stowe. He was educated at King's School, Rochester, and St John's College, Cambridge, where he first read mathematics but changed to classics, in which he obtained a BA in 1884. After graduation he studied oriental philosophy at Oxford and then taught classics at various minor public schools until 1889.<br>
<br>Mead had joined the Theosophical Society in 1884 and determined to devote his life to the cause of theosophy. In 1889 he became Madame H. P. Blavatsky's private secretary, and after her death in 1891 he edited many of her works&#151;notably the revised edition of <span class="italic">The Secret Doctrine</span> (1897). He had been appointed general secretary of the European section of the Theosophical Society in 1890, and for almost twenty years his ability to balance objective scholarship with a sympathetic approach to spiritual reality ensured that the society maintained at least the semblance of academic respectability. Even more important, in terms of the society's survival, was Mead's genuine tolerance of dissenting beliefs that enabled him to steer the society through its first internal crisis. This arose in 1894 when a prominent theosophist, William Quan Judge, was accused of self-promotion by sending fraudulent &#145;Mahatma&#146; letters (letters containing doctrinal teachings and practical instructions from allegedly supernatural beings) to selected influential members of the society. Compromise between the pro- and anti-Judge factions proved impossible and although Mead came down against Judge, his skill in handling the situation prevented the inevitable split from being a fatal wound.<br>
<br>Mead was now seen as one of the Theosophical Society's foremost members, a view that became entrenched as he poured out a stream of books and articles, some of which had a lasting influence beyond the narrow confines of the society itself. Thus in 1896 Mead's <span class="italic">Orpheus</span>, his study of &#145;the theosophy of the Greeks&#146;, greatly impressed W. B. Yeats and led him to revise his earlier opinion that Mead's intellect resembled that &#145;of a good-sized whelk&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 282). In the same year Mead published his version of <span class="italic">Pistis Sophia</span>, the first translation into English of any significant or complete gnostic text. This was followed in 1900 by <span class="italic">Fragments of a Faith Forgotten</span>, a general survey of gnosticism, and in 1906 by <span class="italic">Thrice-Greatest Hermes</span>, an outstanding translation and critical commentary on the hermetic texts of the Hellenistic era. With these works Mead established himself as an authority in the field of Christian origins, although his reputation was severely dented by his admission in 1903 that in his book <span class="italic">Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?</span> he had considered (but had not accepted) evidence on the question obtained by clairvoyant means.<br>
<br>Mead's critical approach can be clearly seen in the contents of the <span class="italic">Theosophical Review</span>, which he edited from 1898 to 1909, and in the eyes of the Theosophical Society Mead was now proving to be too honest a scholar. But it was not to be academic differences that drove him to resign from the society&#151;it was a matter of sexual morality. Mead had been happily married since 12 July 1899 to Laura Mary Cooper (1855/6&#150;1924), an author and fellow theosophist, the daughter of the late Frederick Henry Cooper, an Indian civil servant. He unquestioningly accepted the sexual mores of his day and was profoundly shocked when in 1906 the paedophile activities of C. W. Leadbeater came to light. Leadbeater was one of the most respected theosophists of his day and the uproar was great, but public scandal was avoided when Mead secured his resignation from the society. The real problem arose two years later when Annie Besant, by now president of the Theosophical Society, performed a volte-face and early in 1909 brought an unrepentant Leadbeater back into the fold. Mead had fought vigorously and publicly against Leadbeater's reinstatement, and having failed to keep him out, promptly resigned, taking 700 fellow theosophists with him.<br>
<br>Mead was determined to provide a forum for all those who wished, as he did, &#145;to promote investigation and comparative study of religion, philosophy and science, on the basis of experience&#146;  (Mead and Waite, 3) and in March 1909, with the aid of A. E. Waite, he established the Quest Society and a journal of the same name. Both <span class="italic">The Quest</span> and its parent society survived for twenty years, fulfilling their purpose with the aid of writers and speakers as diverse as Martin Buber, Ezra Pound, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Arthur Machen, Tagore, and Yeats. The success of <span class="italic">The Quest</span> also ensured Mead's return to academic respectability: in 1917 he supplied the entry on occultism for James Hastings's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</span>.<br>
<br>Mead's last important work, <span class="italic">The Gnostic John the Baptizer</span>, appeared in 1924 but after the death of his wife in the same year Mead wrote little of any significance, and when <span class="italic">The Quest</span> came to an end in 1930 his career as a scholar effectively ended with it. By this time he had become increasingly preoccupied with psychical research and he continued to wrestle with the question of survival until his death on 28 September 1933 at his home, 21 Ovington Street, Chelsea, London. He was cremated at Golders Green two days later. His works on Christian origins have since been superseded, but while he was not the only pioneer in the study of gnosticism, he was the first scholar to present a sympathetic view of gnostic and hermetic texts and the first to bring them before a wider public.<br>
