<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ball,  John Thomas</span>  (1815&#150;1898), <span class="occ">judge</span>, born in Dublin on 24 July 1815, was the eldest son of Major Benjamin Marcus Ball (1789&#150;1841) and Elizabeth (1789&#150;1838), daughter of Cuthbert Feltus of Hollybrook, co. Carlow. His father was an officer who served with distinction in the 40th regiment of foot during the peninsular campaign. He was educated at Dr Smith's school in Rutland Square, Dublin, and entered Trinity College in 1831 at an unusually early age. Ball won a classical scholarship in 1833 and in 1835 graduated as senior moderator and gold medallist in ethics and logic. In 1836 he graduated BA. While at Trinity, Ball made friends with Isaac Butt (1813&#150;1879), Samuel O'Sullivan (1790&#150;1851), Mortimer O'Sullivan (1791&#150;1859), Joseph Sheridan le Fanu (1814&#150;1873), and other eminent men of his generation; he was also a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>, and was president of the college historical society in 1837. Ball's articles were mostly on historical and biographical subjects, but he also wrote verse. In 1844 he graduated LLD.<br>
<br>Ball had been called to the Irish bar in 1840. He quickly rose to an eminent position, and in 1854 he took silk. In 1852 he married Catherine Elrington (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8756/', "Revd Charles Richard Elrington")</script>, regius professor of divinity in the University of Dublin. They had three children, the youngest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30563/', "Francis Elrington Ball")</script>, is noted for his authorship of <span class="italic">The Judges in Ireland, 1221&#150;1921</span>. As a queen's counsel Ball's practice lay mainly in the ecclesiastical courts, and later in the Probate and Matrimonial Division, where his knowledge of civil law and his subtlety in argument led to his rapid promotion to a senior position. In 1862 the primate, Marcus Beresford, appointed him vicar-general of the province of Armagh. This appointment marked the beginning of Ball's active interest in the affairs of the Church of Ireland, of which he was a devout member. In 1863 he was elected a bencher of the King's Inns, and in 1865 he was made queen's advocate in Ireland.<br>
<br>In the same year Ball first entered politics and stood in the general election as an independent candidate for the University of Dublin. He was a proponent of legislation for ecclesiastical reform; his policy involved the admission of deficiencies within the church structure and he was defeated at the polls. In 1867 Ball was nominated as a member of the royal commission appointed by Disraeli to inquire into the state of the Church of Ireland, and in the following year he became a member of the Conservative administration as solicitor-general for Ireland. Later in the same year he was promoted to the position of attorney-general for Ireland. In the meantime Gladstone's declarations had raised the issue of disestablishment in a direct form, and Ball's abilities and knowledge of ecclesiastical affairs meant that at the general election of 1868 he was returned to parliament as member for the university.<br>
<br>Ball played a leading role in opposing the <span class="roman">Irish Church Act</span>, a measure aimed at the disestablishment of all churches in Ireland. His speech on the second reading was a remarkable oratorical triumph, placing him in the front rank of parliamentary speakers and winning him the approbation of Disraeli. Ball's efforts were sustained throughout the long struggle over the details of the bill. Early in 1870, when the marquess of Salisbury was installed as chancellor of the University of Oxford, his services were acknowledged by the conferral of the honorary degree of DCL. Subsequently he helped to frame the future constitution of the disestablished Church of Ireland, not only devising and drafting that constitution but acting as assessor to the primate in the often stormy meetings of the general synod.<br>
<br>From 1869 to 1874 Ball remained a vigorous member of the Conservative opposition and took an active part in the debates on Gladstone's <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span> of 1870 and the <span class="roman">Irish University Bill</span> of 1873. His opposition to the <span class="roman">Land Bill</span> was confined to effective criticism of its details; but his objections to Gladstone's university scheme (involving the closure of some Irish third-level institutions and the opening of a new university) attacked the bill in principle. Ball's parliamentary activity was not confined solely to Irish questions; one of his finest speeches dealt with the <span class="roman">Ballot Act</span> and evinced his opposition to the extension of the franchise.<br>
<br>In 1874, on the formation of Disraeli's second administration, Ball's position and services made him a clear contender for the highest office in the law in Ireland; but the prime minister wished to keep him in the House of Commons so that he could work on the <span class="roman">Irish Judicature Bill</span>, and he was reappointed attorney-general. Therefore it was not until 1875 that he became lord chancellor of Ireland, where he remained until the fall of the Disraeli government in April 1880. During that time he earned a reputation as a judge whose appeals from the Probate Division were especially distinguished by legal learning, argumentative power, and literary form.<br>
<br>On his retirement from the chancellorship, Ball became less involved in public life, though in 1880 he accepted the nomination by Earl Cairns to the office of vice-chancellor of the University of Dublin. In 1881 he presided over the section of jurisprudence at the meeting of the social science congress at Dublin, and delivered an address on jurisprudence and the amendment of the law.<br>
<br>On the return of his party to office under Lord Salisbury in 1885, Ball did not feel that he was in strong enough health to resume the Irish chancellorship, and he spent his time in writing. In 1886 he published <span class="italic">The Reformed Church of Ireland</span>, a work in which he traced the history of the church from the Reformation to his own time. The book won praise from churchmen of the day for its even-handedness, and a second, enlarged edition appeared in 1890. In the year after his wife's death, Ball's work of church history was followed by his <span class="italic">Historical Review of the Legislative Systems Operative in Ireland from the Invasion of Henry the Second to the Union</span> (1888, second edn 1889), in which he sought<blockquote>to trace the succession of these systems to each other, the forms they respectively assumed, and their distinctive peculiarities, and at the same time to consider the controversies connected with the claim made by the English parliament to legislate for Ireland. (Author's preface)</blockquote>The author's objective and balanced approach to contentious topics won him praise from Gladstone, Smith, and Lecky, who emphasized the judicial impartiality with which the book was written.<br>
<br>From 1890 old age confined Ball more to his home at Dundrum, co. Dublin. However, he retained until 1895 his office of vice-chancellor of the university. Subsequently his declining health compelled him gradually to divest himself of numerous honorary offices such as those of chancellor of the archdioceses of Armagh and Dublin, assessor to the general synod of the Church of Ireland, senator of the Royal University, and chairman of the board of intermediate education. He died at Dundrum on St Patrick's day, 17 March 1898, and was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin.<br>
<br>Ball was remembered as an impressive orator and as one of the few nineteenth-century Irishmen who were able to persuade the Commons. A portrait of him was left to the hall of the King's Inns, Dublin; there is also a woodcut in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and a photograph, reproduced in W. Ball-Wright's <span class="italic">Records of the Anglo-Irish Families of Ball</span>.<br>
