<span class="headword">Kenrick,  John</span>  (1788&#150;1877), <span class="occ">historian and tutor</span>, was born on 4 February 1788 at Exeter, the eldest son and second of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15415/', "Timothy Kenrick (1759&#150;1804)")</script>, Unitarian minister, and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1793), the daughter of John Waymouth of Exeter, merchant. His father married second Elizabeth Belsham (1743&#150;1819), sister of Thomas Belsham (1750&#150;1829), who proved a &#145;conscientious and affectionate&#146; stepmother  (Kenrick, 6). He received his early education from his father, and in 1793 was sent to the grammar school conducted by the Revd Charles Lloyd (1766&#150;1829), where, after an initial distaste for classical grammar, he made good progress in Latin and Greek. In 1799 he entered the nonconformist academy conducted by his father and the Revd Joseph Bretland (1742&#150;1819), even though he was only in his twelfth year and considerably below the age of the other students. He studied Greek and Latin, and later Hebrew. Because of his age, his removal from a school discipline was not a success, and his father had already decided to place him at school again when he died suddenly in 1804. Thomas Foster Barham (1766&#150;1844) taught him German, of great importance later for his classical and biblical studies. With Barham he wrote essays and sermons, the only direct training he received for the ministry. After the Exeter Academy closed in March 1805 Kenrick continued his studies at Birmingham under John Kentish, his father's intimate friend, who for two years directed his reading. In 1807, on the advice of Lant Carpenter, Kenrick entered Glasgow University with a Dr Williams's exhibition, where he studied for three years, graduating MA on 1 May 1810. Although personally obliged to a number of the professors, privately he was to be critical of the quality of instruction, though he did later appreciate the benefits when he began to teach himself. Kenrick's considerable intellectual powers and scholarship were evident while at Glasgow. He was the first prizeman in his class for all three years, won the Gartmore gold medal for an essay on the English constitution in the Tudor period, and a silver medal for an essay on the aberration of light. &#145;He is spoken in higher terms than were ever bestowed upon a young man&#146;  (Charles Wellbeloved, 6 April 1809, Harris Manchester College, Oxford, Wood MS 1, fol. 84<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In 1809 Kenrick was invited to become classics tutor at Manchester College, York, but he did not take up the appointment until after graduating the following year. Although highly praised by Charles Wellbeloved (1769&#150;1858), the theological tutor, he had little experience of teaching and began to doubt his own abilities. He offered his resignation at Christmas 1810, but was persuaded to withdraw it. In 1817 feelings of personal inadequacy and shyness again led him to offer his resignation with the intention of studying abroad. In 1819 he was given leave of absence to spend a year in Germany. During the winter semester he studied history at G&ouml;ttingen under A. H. L. Heeren, attending also the lectures of J. G. Eichhorn and J. F. Blumenbach; the following summer semester he devoted to classical study at Berlin under the great philologists, studying Tacitus with F. A. Wolf, Demosthenes with A. Boeckh, and Latin composition and conversation with K. G. Zumpt, and he attended Friedrich Schleiermacher's course of philosophy. After a tour in southern Germany and Switzerland he returned to York in September 1820. This introduction to the main nineteenth-century advances in German historical criticism and philology was of critical importance to his intellectual development.<br>
<br>In 1818 and again in 1825 Thomas Belsham tried to persuade Kenrick to become his assistant at Essex Street Chapel, London; but Kenrick had decided upon an academic career: though an able exponent of his own theological position, he had none of the gifts of a popular preacher. He had also married Wellbeloved's eldest daughter, Laetitia (<i>d</i>. 1879), on 13 August 1821; they had no children.<br>
<br>Kenrick was the greatest scholar among the Unitarians of his day: he was the equal of Eliezer Cogan (1762&#150;1855) in erudition, and his superior in culture. His reputation as a classical scholar was established by his highly popular translations, <span class="italic">Latin Grammar</span> (1823; 5th edn, 1839), from Zumpt's work, and <span class="italic">Introduction to Greek Prose Composition</span> (1835; 3rd edn, 1839), from the work by V. C. F. Rost and E. F. Wusteman, and by his own <span class="italic">Exercises on Latin Syntax</span> (1825; 4th edn, 1838) and pioneering textbooks for schools. He was chosen by Bishop Blomfield to revise the fifth edition of A. H. Matthiae's greatly enlarged <span class="italic">Greek Grammar</span> (1832).<br>
<br>In 1840, when the college returned to Manchester, Kenrick became professor of history and served also as principal from 1846; he retired from both offices in 1850. He continued to live in York, and travelled to Manchester to deliver his lectures. His later publications were principally historical: <span class="italic">The Egypt of Herodotus</span> (1841), <span class="italic">Ancient Egypt under the Pharaohs</span> (1850), and <span class="italic">Phoenicia</span> (1855). Curator of antiquities for the Yorkshire Museum from 1858 until his death, he also published on Roman York. Kenrick regularly attended the annual meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science during the 1830s. Although only marginally concerned with natural science itself, he did help mould Unitarian reactions to the religious controversies over Darwinism and the origins of the earth. His <span class="italic">Essay on Primeval History</span> (1846) demonstrated how the principles of criticism could be applied to myths and traditions. His theology, while essentially that of the older Unitarian school, was modified in its conservatism by his acceptance of the new standards of biblical criticism. Both his teaching and his writings were characterized by his immense scholarship and &#145;comprehensive grasp&#146; of the subject's &#145;whole outline &hellip; nothing fragmentary, nothing discursive, nothing speculative, broke the proportions&#146; or disturbed his overall interpretation  (Martineau, 408). An outstanding teacher who breathed life into the classics by placing them in their historical contexts, he was, however, a severe critic of those students who fell short of his exacting standards. Through his pupils, most notably John James Tayler (1797&#150;1869), James Martineau (1805&#150;1900), and George Vance Smith (1816&#150;1902), and his writings he was responsible for helping to introduce to Britain the main nineteenth-century advances in German historical criticism and philology. On his death in York on 7 May 1877 <span class="italic">The Times</span> described him as &#145;indisputably the greatest nonconformist scholar of our day&#146;  (26 May 1877). He was buried in York cemetery on 12 May.<br>
