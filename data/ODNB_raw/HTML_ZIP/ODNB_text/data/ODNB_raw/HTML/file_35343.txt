<span class="headword">Ottley, Sir  Charles Langdale</span>  (1858&#150;1932), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Richmond, Yorkshire, on 8 February 1858, the seventh son of Lawrence Ottley (1808&#150;1861), rector of Richmond and canon of Ripon, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of John Bickersteth, rector of Sapcote, Leicestershire, and the sister of Robert Bickersteth, bishop of Ripon. Robert Lawrence Ottley, canon of Christ Church, Oxford, was his elder brother. He entered the Royal Navy in 1871, and in 1877 was serving as a midshipman in the screw corvette <i>Amethyst</i>, when in company with the <i>Shah</i> she engaged the rebel Peruvian warship <i>Huascar</i> off the coast of Peru. He gained accelerated promotion to lieutenant in 1879 by obtaining first-class certificates in all his examinations, and in 1882, as lieutenant of the <i>Monarch</i>, under Captain George Tryon, was present at the bombardment of Alexandria. Later in that year he returned home in order to qualify as a torpedo officer, and while serving in the <i>Vernon</i> he displayed marked technical ability by devising a successful automatic mooring gear for submarine mines. In 1884&#150;6 he was torpedo lieutenant of Rear-Admiral Tryon's flagship, the <i>Nelson</i>, on the Australia station; he was later appointed torpedo lieutenant of the <i>Camperdown</i> and afterwards of the <i>Victoria</i>, flagships of the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, Admiral Sir Anthony Hoskins, who was later relieved by Vice-Admiral Tryon. Ottley was promoted commander in June 1892, but remained in the ship in that rank as executive officer until early in 1893, when he returned home to become commander of the <i>Vernon</i> for two and a half years. In 1892 he married Kathleen Margaret, the daughter of Colonel Alexander Stewart, Royal Artillery; their son died of wounds in 1914. He resumed sea service in 1897, in command of the sloop <i>Nymphe</i> in the Mediterranean, and was employed chiefly as senior naval officer at Port Said (1897) and at Constantinople (1898).<br>
<br>Ottley relinquished command of the <i>Nymphe</i> on his promotion to captain in January 1899, and was then appointed naval attach&eacute; to various British embassies; he acted in that capacity during the next five years in Washington, Rome, Tokyo, St Petersburg, and Paris, thereby gaining unique knowledge and experience of foreign navies and foreign policy. Towards the end of his service as naval attach&eacute; he contemplated adopting a political career, and he was chosen in 1903 as prospective Conservative candidate for Pembroke Boroughs. But his special qualifications led to his appointment in 1904 to the staff of the recently established committee of imperial defence, and in 1905 to his selection, although a comparatively junior captain, to succeed Rear-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg (afterwards Louis Mountbatten, first marquess of Milford Haven) as director of naval intelligence, then the most important post, other than membership of the board, in the Admiralty; he then abandoned his parliamentary ambitions. This appointment made Ottley a key member of Admiral Sir John Fisher's inner planning &eacute;lite. As director of naval intelligence he sat on a number of important commissions, notably that of 1906 on war risks to shipping. He favoured an amphibious strategy, and worked to secure the adoption of naval plans by the army. Fisher considered him a genius, but did not take him into his innermost confidence, on account of his well-known loquacity. Ottley opposed Fisher on the key issue of a naval staff, and by 1908 was arguing in private, to Arthur Balfour, that Fisher should be sacrificed to save his naval reforms.<br>
<br>In 1907 Ottley was the principal naval delegate to the second Peace Conference at The Hague, where he took a leading part in drawing up the convention limiting the use of submarine mines, to the development of which he had devoted so much ingenuity many years earlier. In that same year, when the original secretary of the committee of imperial defence, Sir George Clarke (afterwards Lord Sydenham), relinquished that office, owing chiefly to differences of view which had arisen between him and the first sea lord, Sir John Fisher, Ottley was selected, largely at Fisher's insistence, to relieve him. In 1908 he was a delegate to the International Maritime Conference of London, and accepted the dangerous limits that it placed on the use of Britain's greatest weapon, the economic blockade. He reached the top of the captains' list in that year, but not having served at sea in that rank he was automatically placed on the retired list on promotion to rear-admiral (1908). However, he remained secretary to the committee of imperial defence until February 1912, when he had completed five years in office. Those five years, largely as a result of Ottley's unostentatious but skilful organization and guidance, allied to the efforts of his deputy, and later successor, Captain Maurice Hankey RM, formed the most important period in the development of the committee into a highly efficient instrument for the co-ordination of the nation's resources and forces in the preparation for, and conduct of, a total war.<br>
<br>Having lost the confidence of Fisher over economic warfare and other issues, Ottley left office in 1912 to take up the post of director of Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., of Newcastle upon Tyne. Their offer was financially very attractive, and, despite the best efforts of the prime minister, Asquith, the Treasury refused to match it. Churchill considered Ottley the best choice as his first chief of naval staff in October 1911, and in August 1912 tried to get the Treasury to meet his terms for leaving Armstrong Whitworth, where he was unhappy and ashamed of himself for having left the public service. Once again, nothing came of this approach, and Ottley remained with Armstrong Whitworth, taking an active part in the superintendence of that company's output of war material, particularly after the outbreak of war in 1914. He worked closely with the Admiralty over the Turkish battleship and dockyard contract of 1913.<br>
<br>On retirement from office in 1912, Ottley made his home at Coruanan, Fort William, Inverness-shire. He was appointed MVO in 1903, CB in 1911, and KCMG in 1907 for his services at The Hague Peace Conference. He retired from the board of Armstrongs in 1926 on the post-war reconstruction of the company when it amalgamated with Vickers after a financial crisis. A few days before his death he moved from Coruanan to Creag, Tarbert, Argyll, where he died on 24 September 1932. He was a man of much charm and no little literary ability, a good linguist, and a fluent, convincing, and persuasive speaker. Despite his many talents, however, he was not a leader. He made the committee of imperial defence a highly effective secretariat and co-ordinating body, but never achieved the influence or eminence of his successor. He was, like many of his contemporaries, exploited to further the aims of Lord Fisher, and then discarded when he was of no further use.<br>
