<span class="headword">Williams,  Alfred</span>  (1832&#150;1905), <span class="occ">alpine painter</span>, was born at Newark-on-Trent on 4 May 1832, the youngest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29487/', "Charles Williams (1796&#150;1866)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29503/', "Williams, Frederick Smeeton")</script>], a Congregational minister, and his wife, Mary Smeeton. The Congregational minister and railway historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29503/', "Frederick Smeeton Williams (1829&#150;1886)")</script> was a brother. He was educated first at a private school and subsequently at University College School, London. He learnt drawing at a private academy and landscape painting from the watercolourist William Bennett (1811&#150;1871). As a young man he supported himself by drawing on wood for book illustrations. From 1849 to 1856 he illustrated publications of the Religious Tract Society and of Messrs Cassell &amp; Co., as well as his brother Frederick's <span class="italic">Our Iron Roads</span> (1852); he was also for a time assistant to the history painter Sir John Gilbert.<br>
<br>From 1854, when Williams made an extended walking tour in northern Italy and Switzerland, his interest in painting centred on mountain scenery. In 1861 he settled at Salisbury and, founding there the maltster's business afterwards known as Williams Brothers, was engaged in trade until his retirement in 1886. Meanwhile, during the summer months he travelled, chiefly in Switzerland, pursuing his art, which occupied him wholly after his retirement. In 1878 he was elected to the Alpine Club. His subjects were chiefly drawn from the Alps and the mountains of Scotland, but in 1900&#150;01 he spent twelve months in India. At the Alpine Club, exhibitions of his watercolour drawings were held in March 1889, of his Indian paintings in 1902, and again of watercolours from 5 to 23 December 1905. Between 1880 and 1890 he exhibited four works at the Royal Academy, one at the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists, and one at the New Gallery. He was skilful in rendering the effect of sunlight on distant snow and in giving an impression of the size of great mountains. One of his watercolour drawings, <span class="italic">Monte Rosa at Sunrise from Above Alagna</span>, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Williams married in 1863 Sarah, daughter of George Gregory of Salisbury; there were no children from this union. He married, second, on 26 July 1866, Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of Samuel Walker of Northampton, with whom he had one son and one daughter, Frances Lilian, who married the Congregational minister and scholar George Buchanan Gray. Williams died at the Grand H&ocirc;tel, St Maxime-sur-Mer, Var, France, on 19 March 1905, and was buried at St Maxime.<br>
