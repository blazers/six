<span class="headword">Townshend <span class="st"> [Townsend]</span>,  Aurelian</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1583&#150;1649?), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the son of John Townshend of Dereham Abbey, Norfolk, and his wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4896/', "Sir Robert Catlin (d. 1574)")</script>, chief justice of the queen's bench. Aurelian and his sister Franceline (or Francelliana) were both born some time before 12 December 1583, when they are mentioned in the will of Thomas Townshend, yeoman of Crimplesham, Norfolk. Aurelian was third cousin of the Armada veteran Sir Roger Townshend (1543?&#150;1590) of Raynham, and of the parliamentary historian Hayward Townshend (<i>c</i>.1577&#150;1603&times;21).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandassociationwiththecourt"></a>Early career and association with the court</h2>In 1600 Aurelian attracted the attention of the secretary of state, Sir Robert Cecil, who proposed to train him for the service of his young son William. A warrant by Cecil dated 1 April 1600 authorizes travelling expenses for &#145;Aurelianus Townesend&#146; as the queen's messenger to Sir Henry Neville, English ambassador in France (Pipe Office, declared accounts, roll 543, m. 57<i>v</i>; <span class="italic">Aurelian Townshend's Poems and Masks</span>, xxxvii). In a letter to Neville at the same time Cecil described Townshend as &#145;a young gentleman&#146; who &#145;hath bin well bredd, and by his owne industrie attayned to a good superficiall knowledge in the French and Italian tongues&#146; and who also showed promise of being able to &#145;write faire hands&#146;; he accordingly entrusted him to Neville's care, both linguistic and moral (R. Winwood, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, ed. E. Sawyer, 1725, 1.167; <span class="italic">Aurelian Townshend's Poems and Masks</span>, xxxvii&#150;xxxviii). After he had been a year in Paris, Cecil sent the young Townshend on to Venice, whence he continued, in a spirit of dutiful gratitude, to keep his patron informed of such local and diplomatic news as he might encounter. He does not seem, however, to have been very discreet in his choice of acquaintances. One man he recommended to Cecil, Dr John Thornil, canon of Vicenza, would soon turn out to be a Catholic emissary, harboured in London by the Venetian ambassador, while yet another, the adventurer and intriguer Sir Anthony Sherley, succeeded in tricking Townshend out of 200 <i>scudi</i> of Cecil's money. Townshend himself was obliged to borrow 100 <i>scudi</i> from the merchant John Brown in order to complete a journey through Tuscany and the Romagna and get back to Venice, but Cecil refused to pay this bill and summoned him home. Townshend's misfortunes were compounded when, on the way back through France, he sprained his ankle, fell ill, spent all his money, and could complete his journey only by imploring Cecil, on 7 February 1603, once again for funds.<br>
<br>Townshend is next heard of in the company of the philosophical writer, poet, and diplomat Sir Edward Herbert on a mission to the king of France, Henri IV, in 1608&#150;9. Herbert describes him in his autobiography as &#145;a Gentleman That spake the Languages of Frensh Italian and Spanish, in greate Perfection&#146;; as the man who was entrusted to deliver a challenge to a Frenchman with whom Herbert had quarrelled, but also as one of those companions who failed to come to Herbert's assistance when he was cornered by a boar on a hunt  (<span class="italic">The Life of Edward, First Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Written by Himself</span>, ed. J. M. Shuttleworth, 1976, 41&#150;2, 47). Passing references suggest that he may still have served Herbert in some connection as late as 8 April 1615, when, in a letter to Herbert, his stepfather Sir John Danvers refers to &#145;the hundred pounds imployed&#146; by Herbert &#145;for Mr. Townsend&#146;  (&#145;Old Herbert papers at Powis Castle and in the British Museum&#146;, <span class="italic">Collections Historical &amp; Archaeological Relating to Montgomeryshire and its Borders</span>, 20, 1886, 84). He may also have continued to serve Cecil up to the time of his death in 1612 for, in his account of Cecil's last days, his chaplain John Bowles mentions an afternoon when Cecil &#145;had noe companie with him, but onely Master Townsend&#146;  (Francis Peck, <span class="italic">Desiderata curiosa</span>, new edn, 2 vols., 1779, 1.208). Nevertheless, positive evidence of Townshend's employment during most of his early years is lacking.<br>
<br>An autograph letter signed by Townshend (&#145;A Tounshend&#146;) to William Trumbull, English resident in Brussels, dated from Hampton Court on 13 March 1621  (BL, Add. MS 72360, fols. 136<i>r</i>&#150;137<i>v</i>), indicates that he was then still connected with the court and very much <i>au courant</i> with court news and gossip. Townshend refers in passing to his sister (Franceline, who would be reported by James Wadsworth in <span class="italic">The English Spanish Pilgrime</span>, 1629, 69, to be playing &#145;the shee Physitian in the Archdutches Court&#146; in Flanders) and to &#145;my L[ord] of Westmerland&#146; (her lover in exile, the bigamous Edmund Neville, conspirator and unsuccessful claimant to the earldom of Westmorland). Townshend excuses himself from coming over again to Brussels himself &#145;this somer&#146; because his passport must be signed by &#145;too many handes&#146; (&#145;for I see a poore man that hath many frends, hath almost no tyme of his owne&#146;). Parish registers reveal that between 1622 and 1634 &#145;Aurelian Townsend gentleman&#146; was living in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, where his Norfolk kinsmen had once maintained town residences. Some time between 1619 and 1622 he married Anne (<i>c</i>.1597&#150;<i>c</i>.1667), daughter of Edward Wythies of Copgrave, Yorkshire. She was the widow of William Agborough (<i>d</i>. 1619), with whom she had one son, Robert, who later adopted Townshend's surname and was knighted in 1660. She bore Townshend five recorded children: George (<i>bap</i>. 17 Dec 1622), Mary (<i>bap</i>. 8 April 1626), James (<i>bap</i>. 15 Dec 1627), Herbert (<i>bap</i>. 23 Sept 1631; <i>bur</i>. 26 Feb 1634), and Frances (<i>bap</i>. 17 Nov 1632). On 3 June 1629 the king granted a petition by Townshend allowing him custody and administration of the estate of the deranged Philippa Ivatt, widow of Thomas Ivatt, searcher of London  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1628&#150;9</i>, 143/40, 144/34).<h2>
<a name="Writerofcourtmasquesandpoet"></a>Writer of court masques and poet</h2>Early in 1632 Townshend suddenly came to prominence as a writer of court masques, as temporary successor to Ben Jonson, who had fallen out of favour. On 8 January the king's twelfth night masque <span class="italic">Albions Triumph</span> was presented, for which Townshend wrote the verses and description (modestly referring to himself in the printed edition as being &#145;as loath to be brought upon the Stage as an unhansom Man is to see himselfe in a great Glasse&#146;, but that he had obeyed the command of the king). The elaborate scenery, machinery, and costumes were devised by Jonson's old rival Inigo Jones, who was also chiefly responsible for the queen's shrovetide masque a month later, <span class="italic">Tempe Restor'd</span>, to which Townshend contributed the verses. Although some of Townshend's poems were undoubtedly written earlier, it is from the years immediately following these two masques that the bulk of his surviving works can probably be dated. He contributed to further court masques: one on 21 December 1635, when he supplied the antimasques after the French pastoral <span class="italic">Florim&egrave;ne</span> performed by the queen's ladies; another when he contributed a &#145;Bacchanall&#146; song to a &#145;maske before their Majestys&#146;, probably the court revival on 12 January 1637 of William Cartwright's <span class="italic">The Royal Slave</span>. He also contributed some time in this period to an entertainment presented before the king by the Merchant Adventurers' Company.<br>
<br>Townshend's attachment to the court and to the aristocratic, fashionable society of his day is evident in various of his poems, addressed or paying tribute not only to the king and queen themselves but also to the likes of Lady Judith May, wife of the vice-chamberlain of the household Sir Humphrey May, Sir Kenelm Digby, Henry Carey, earl of Monmouth, and the court musician Henry Lawes and his brother William. One of his neighbours in the Barbican was apparently John Egerton, first earl of Bridgewater, to whom he presented a copy of <span class="italic">Albions Triumph</span> (now in the Huntington Library). Egerton's children took part in <span class="italic">Tempe Restor'd</span>, and his wife was mourned by Townshend in March 1636 in a funeral elegy. Like his daughter, Townshend may also have been on good terms with members of the Sackville family, one of whom, the fourth earl of Dorset's son Edward, he mourned in an elegy in 1645. Other friends included the court poet Thomas Carew, whose &#145;sweet&#146; wit and manly spirit Townshend praised in his elegy on Gustavus Adolphus (killed 6 November 1632). Carew warmly responded in his elegy on the same subject by addressing Townshend as &#145;my dear Aurelian&#146;; the poem notes that Townshend was living in the Barbican at this time. On 8 August 1633 &#145;Aurelian Towneshend, Esq.&#146; was also admitted to the fellowship of Gray's Inn, then a privileged society of gentlemen as much noted for its literary activities as its legal pursuits.<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwar"></a>The civil war</h2>By the time of the civil war Townshend's luck may have been waning. According to a reported but unverifiable inscription supposedly by Philip Herbert, earl of Pembroke, in a book apparently dated 1642, the &#145;poore &amp; pocky Poett&#146; Townshend, &#145;but a marryed man &amp; an howsekeeper in Barbican&#146;, would have been &#145;glad to sell an 100 verses now at sixepence a piece, 50 shillinges an 100 verses&#146; (cited in Alexander Dyce's edition of <span class="italic">The Works of Beaumont and Fletcher</span>, 1843&#150;6, 1.xvii). It must have been financial straits which made Townshend petition the House of Lords for protection (granted 3 March 1643) against arrest by Isaak Tulley, silkman, on a claim of &pound;600 for silk and fringes he bespoke for the use of Lewis Boyle, Viscount Kinalmeaky  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 5.632). Nevertheless, he described himself in that petition as &#145;the King's Ordinary Servant&#146;, and his association with the court persisted. This may, perhaps, be linked to the court successes in another sense of his daughter Mary, to whom he addressed the gently admonitory &#145;Let not thy beauties make thee proud&#146;. Before she was twenty she was successively mistress of Charles Louis, elector palatine (1617&#150;1680), and Edward Sackville, fourth earl of Dorset (1590&#150;1652), and was even rumoured in 1647 to have dallied with the elector palatine's younger brother, Prince Maurice (1620&#150;1652)  (&#145;Divers remarkable passages of the ladies at Spring-Garden, in parliament assembled&#146;, <span class="italic">Scarce and Valuable Tracts &hellip; Lord Somers</span>, 2nd edn, 5.472&#150;3). On 26 February 1646 she married, as his second wife, George Kirke, a groom of the bedchamber and gentleman of the robes, at Christ Church, Oxford, where, according to William Dugdale, &#145;The King gave her; she being the admired beauty of the tymes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life, Diary, and Correspondence of Sir William Dugdale</span>, ed. W. Hamper, 1827, 84). The king even settled upon her a jointure of &pound;500  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1676&#150;7</i>, 132). The couple remained loyal to Charles during the upheavals of the war&#151;as did Townshend's eldest son, George, and his stepson, Robert, who both fought and suffered imprisonment for the king. George and Mary Kirke received various royal favours and allowances after the Restoration before George Kirke's death in 1675; his widow, who was generously pensioned, lived on to 1702.<br>
<br>Townshend himself, however, may not have stayed the course of the war in England, but was possibly the &#145;Mr. Townshend, Gent.&#146; who was among the seventy &#145;servants and attendants&#146; of princes Rupert and Maurice allowed by Sir Thomas Fairfax, on 19 June 1646, to leave for the continent after the fall of Oxford  (E. Warburton, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Prince Rupert, and the Cavaliers</span>, 1849, 3.234). It is possible that in this period he supported himself by serving as a tutor to one or more younger exiles, including Sir Roger Townshend (1628&#150;1648) and his brother Horatio, later Baron and Viscount Townshend (<i>bap</i>. 1630, <i>d</i>. 1687), who, on 16 December 1646, had leave from parliament to travel abroad for three years. The grant of arms to Horatio by Sir Edward Walker in 1663 mentions Horatio's having received his education under Aurelian Townshend  (BL, Add. MS 37675, fol. 49<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Townshend is next heard of in a poem by one C. R. &#145;To my Worthy Friend A:T:&#146;, inviting him to write an elegy on Lord Francis Villiers, who was killed by parliamentary forces at Kingston on 7 July 1648. Hailing Townshend as &#145;the last of all the Poets race&#146; with &#145;the ablest Pen&#146; the writer stresses how &#145;old&#146; the poet is (&#145;Your health a sicknesse, &amp; your Muse growne cold&#146;), his &#145;Long-spun Thread&#146; almost &#145;become a shread&#146;  (University College, London, Ogden MS 42, 3&#150;4). It is possible (from the attribution in a fragment of the poem formerly among the Sackville papers) that Townshend lived to write one more notable poem: a heroic elegy on Charles I's execution, on 30 January 1649, the complete text of which  (Ogden MS 42, 1&#150;3) is signed &#145;Philobasile&#146; (lover of the king). Otherwise, unless he is the &#145;Tounshend&#146; who contributed a slight, eight-line dialogue to the commendatory poems in Clement Barksdale's <span class="italic">Nympha libethris</span> in 1651, no more is heard of him.<h2>
<a name="Townshendsreputation"></a>Townshend's reputation</h2>Apart from the three main court masques in which he was involved in 1632 and 1635, and two or three sets of commendatory verses, Townshend's writings remained unpublished in his lifetime. They were written for, and confined to, coterie manuscript circulation, and various of the poems were also given musical settings by Henry Lawes and others. Judging by the number of copies surviving in seventeenth-century manuscript miscellanies, a few of his lyrics achieved considerable popularity, especially &#145;Victorious Beauty&#146;, addressed to Catherine Howard, wife (in 1608) of his first patron's son, William Cecil, second earl of Salisbury.<br>
<br>Townshend's literary canon was first established by Chambers in his collected edition (1912). Additions and modifications to it were made, from both manuscript and printed sources, in Cedric C. Brown's edition (1983). Yet further additions (including the two elegies of 1648&#150;9) can be made from a royalist anthology of the 1650s now at University College, London (Ogden MS 42), from manuscripts of verse tributes by him to Lord North and to the newly born Prince Charles  (BL, Add. MSS 27407, fol. 5<i>r</i>, and 27408, fols. 112<i>r</i>&#150;113<i>r</i>), and from Sir Henry Herbert's copy of verses for a masque now in the National Library of Wales (NL Wales, MS 5308E, fols. 12<i>r</i>&#150;13<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>With the exception of a perfunctory reference in Sir John Suckling's &#145;Session of the Poets&#146; (1637), which is heavily outweighed by C.R.'s eulogy in 1648, evidence of the poet's contemporary reputation is otherwise meagre. In his 1633 elegy on Gustavus Adolphus, Thomas Carew (author of the much more ambitious and successful court masque <span class="italic">Coelum Britannicum</span>, performed 18 February 1634) praised Townshend's ability, in his elegy on Gustavus Adolphus, to &#145;soar&#146; to &#145;a loftier pitch&#146; and make a &#145;noble flight&#146;, while at the same time implying that his customary level was to sing &#145;harmless pastimes&#146; to &#145;rural tunes&#146;.<br>
<br>Townshend's verse is not generally comparable to the more richly textured poems of his more prolific friend Carew, let alone to the metaphysical complexities of John Donne, whose influence nevertheless extended to him as to so many of his contemporaries. But neither is it fair to dismiss him, as T. S. Eliot did, as merely a &#145;faint, pleasing tinkle&#146;  (&#145;The metaphysical poets&#146;, 1921). Townshend's voice was distinctive enough, and somewhere in the rich canon of seventeenth-century English verse is a respectable niche for him where the virtues of accomplished lyricism, charm, sophisticated (if obsequious) gallantry, tact, and courtesy may receive due homage.<br>
