<span class="headword">Biddles,  James</span>  (1815&#150;1871?), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born at Mountsorrel, near Loughborough, the eldest of the seven sons of James Biddles, a Leicestershire farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth. James Biddles the younger married Ann Maria Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1843) at St Margaret's Church, Leicester, on 11 December 1831. The couple's first two children died in infancy, but four daughters survived, of whom the older two, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38746/', "Adelaide Helen Calvert")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4415/', "Calvert, Charles Alexander")</script>] and Clara, became actresses of distinction. Marriage and baptismal records show that during early manhood Biddles engaged in a variety of occupations, including innkeeper, tobacconist, and stage performer.<br>
<br>By the mid-1830s Biddles featured regularly in the playbills and newspaper announcements for the Leicester Theatre: as Guildenstern to W. C. Macready's Hamlet and as Faldo in the afterpiece <span class="italic">The Happiest Days of my Life</span> (26 September 1834); as Petro in Pocock's <span class="italic">The Miller and his Men</span> (6 October 1834); and as Robin Roughead in the farce <span class="italic">Fortune's Frolics</span> (24 February 1835), which was part of a bill which included &#145;The Celebrated Infant [Charles] Kean&#146; in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>.<br>
<br>Typically, for the time, Biddles joined a stock company, that of Mr Harvey, who ran the Plymouth, Weymouth, Exeter, Jersey, and Guernsey circuit. In the summer of 1842 both Biddles and his wife appeared in Weymouth, then travelled to Guernsey, and returned to the mainland in January 1843 for a season in Exeter. In Exeter, Adelaide, aged seven, appeared with Henry Betty, son of the &#145;Infant Roscius&#146;, and with Charles and Ellen Kean. In her memoirs Adelaide recalled that her father was &#145;the low comedian, and very popular&#146; with audiences  (Calvert, 5).<br>
<br>On 1 October 1843 Ann Maria Biddles died from consumption at the age of thirty. With four young daughters to support, Biddles and his brother Tom devised a comic lecture, &#145;Pickings from Punch&#146;, which they toured around the country. At the end of 1844 Biddles had a very different sort of engagement at a leading metropolitan theatre, Covent Garden, where he was a member of the chorus in the elaborate production of Sophocles's <span class="italic">Antigone</span>. From the anonymity of the chorus he progressed, early in 1845, to First Gravedigger, then Third Witch, and finally Glavis in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>&#151;all part of the aforementioned Henry Betty's none too successful London d&eacute;but.<br>
<br>Although Covent Garden conferred status, it offered limited scope for a low comedian and Biddles left to pursue his career elsewhere. During an engagement at Astley's equestrian theatre he met and married his second wife, Malvina Bridges, the daughter of the ringmaster. He then took over the management of the Bower Saloon, a minor theatre near to Westminster Bridge, where he presided from 1845 to 1854, presenting plays suited to the local clientele by, among others, T. E. Wilks, J. T. Blake, J. H. Haines, and S. T. Atkyns. Nautical melodramas, so-called dog dramas, and pantomimes were the specialities of the house, but Biddles also infiltrated more serious fare, such as <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> and Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">William Tell</span>.<br>
<br>Biddles encouraged the careers of his daughters Adelaide and Clara, and when they reached their teens it must have been apparent to him that his family possessed greater talents than he did himself. In 1854 he &#145;fee'd&#146; a theatrical agent to induce Thomas Barry, who was in Europe engaging actors for the forthcoming opening of the new Boston Theatre, to attend a performance at the Bower, as a result of which the whole Biddles family was contracted. Following a protracted voyage aboard a small but cheap vessel, the family arrived in Boston. Adelaide and Clara quickly established themselves as leading attractions, but Biddles and his wife were little used. In 1855 he prevailed upon a willing Barry to release himself and his wife from their contracts. Ever resourceful, he then set up a small company with an American actor in order to tour farces. To facilitate this venture he took American citizenship.<br>
<br>Like her father, Clara Biddles (1840&#150;1905) remained in America; she married first Thomas Barry, who had brought her to the United States and who was her senior by some forty years, and second the English actor William Redmund. Biddles returned to England for Adelaide's marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4415/', "Charles Calvert")</script> in 1856, but he spent the rest of his life in his adopted country, where, according to Adelaide's memoirs, he died, in Iowa, in 1871.<br>
<br>James Biddles's career encompassed a tremendous range of theatrical activity: an important provincial theatre (Leicester); a stock company circuit; one of the major metropolitan houses (Covent Garden); the home of equestrian drama (Astley's); a minor theatre (the Bower Saloon); and, in the New World, initially in Boston and then, as the frontiers rolled back, west as far as Iowa. Personally, Biddles was a man of considerable and diverse talents, great resourcefulness, and profound resilience. Over and above such importance as may be ascribed to him individually, he represents strata of theatrical activity to which the majority of his profession devoted their careers which, for the most part, are unrecorded by posterity.<br>
