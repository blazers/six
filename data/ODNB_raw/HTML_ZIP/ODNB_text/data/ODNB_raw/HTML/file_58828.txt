<span class="headword">Morton,  Alan Lauder</span>  (1893&#150;1971), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, was born at Skaterigg Farm, Jordanhill, Renfrewshire, on 24 April 1893, the youngest of five sons of William Storey Morton, colliery manager, and his wife, Mary Scott. His father did not like the idea of his sons playing professional football instead of pursuing a career. Morton did both. He signed for the famous Glasgow amateur team, Queen's Park, in 1913, to join his elder brother Bob, and, while playing for the amateurs, studied to become a mining engineer.<br>
<br>Morton was already an outstanding footballing talent when he was signed by Rangers' new manager, William (Bill) Struth, as a professional in June 1920; in 1920 he won two international caps for Scotland against Wales and Ireland and was deprived only by injury of a cap against England. Coming from the amateur team, Morton was able to arrange his own financial terms with Rangers and, although his salary was never disclosed, it has been said to have been as much as &pound;4000 a year, an immense sum for the time. Whatever the exact amount, it was undoubtedly the highest of any player in a decade in which Scottish football talent was thick on the ground. Moreover, he continued to work as a mining engineer; as the only Rangers player allowed to play part time, he avoided the daily routine of other professional players and trained only twice a week, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.<br>
<br>Known as the Wee Blue Devil after his performance against England in 1928, Morton shared with his fellow professional footballer of the 1920s Patsy Gallacher a slight build (5 ft 4&frac12; in., 9 stone 7lb) and an extraordinary ability to dominate much larger opponents; but there the comparison ends. Morton came from a different social class and joined a different team; he came from a solidly middle-class family and played for Glasgow Rangers, Scotland's premier establishment club.<br>
<br>The Scottish talent of this time was displayed at its best in the famous 5&#150;1 victory over England by the Wembley Wizards in 1928, a game in which Morton stood out in a diminutive forward line whose skilful attacking game has never been equalled; in Scotland he was supreme, matched only by Patsy Gallacher, but he was never tempted to follow such other talents as Hughie Gallacher and Alex James to England: Morton was too much a Rangers man.<br>
<br>In the inter-war years Rangers dominated Scottish football, and it was in this time that their practice of not playing Catholic footballers became an unwritten policy. Under directors staunchly unionist in politics, royalist in sympathies, and active in freemasonry, Rangers stood in sharp contrast to their Old Firm rivals, the Irish-Catholic Glasgow Celtic. Morton appears to have been in complete sympathy with the ethos of the club and this, as well as his middle-class social credentials, allowed him to go straight from being a player to a position on the board of directors of Rangers after playing six games of the 1932&#150;3 season. In 1933 he enjoyed the rare honour of being the only player invited by the Scottish Football Association to take part in its diamond jubilee dinner.<br>
<br>Morton was Struth's first signing, and the two were instrumental in defining the Rangers' image in this period. In addition to an employment policy that was, like that of all major protestant firms in Scotland at this time, effectively anti-Catholic, Struth and Morton emphasized the social superiority of the protestant Scot in the way they dressed. This amounted almost to a fetish in the case of Struth; and Morton was known as the Wee Society Man for his dapper dress&#151;the business suit, the bowler hat, the leather gloves, and the rolled-up umbrella, characteristic of an insurance society collector.<br>
<br>It was as a footballer, however, that Morton made his name, and this came from dedicated practice to hone his natural talent. In much the same way as young Donald Bradman practised with a golf ball and a cricket stump against a water tank, the young Morton practised chipping a ball through the delivery hole in the family coal cellar. On errands for his parents he was never without a ball as he dribbled it with one foot against the wall on the way to the shops, and dribbled with the other foot on the way back. The result was his remarkable confidence with both feet. He made his name as an outside left, and in addition to his uncanny ball control and dribbling, he perfected a cross that seemed to hang in the air and puzzled opposing defences&#151;probably more taken in by his reputation than the actual flight of the ball, although he did practise the then unfamiliar skills of imparting spin to the ball.<br>
<br>Morton won an unprecedented thirty-one caps for Scotland. His career with Queen's Park was mainly during the years of the First World War, when he played in 247 competitive games. Between 1920 and his retirement in 1933 he played in 498 games for Rangers, won nine league championships and two Scottish cup medals. He was never as much as cautioned by the referee, and remained remarkably free from injury&#151;when he missed the 1926 international against England it became known as the one &#145;where Alan Morton did not play&#146;&#151;and Scotland lost.<br>
<br>Morton remained on the Rangers' board until shortly before his death, at his home, Marchmont, Victoria Place, Airdrie, on 14 December 1971. In the 1959 general election his sister was put forward to oppose Labour in one of its safest seats, Coatbridge and Airdrie, and such was the power of the Morton name that she lost by only 759 votes. Morton never married.<br>
