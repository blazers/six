<span class="headword">Shortland,  Thomas George</span>  (1771&#150;1827), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Commander John Shortland (1736&#150;1804) and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25465/', "Captain John Shortland (1769&#150;1810)")</script>, was born at Portsea, Hampshire, on 10 May 1771. In January 1785 he entered the navy on the <i>Irresistible</i>, flying the broad pennant of Sir Andrew Snape Hamond in the English Channel. In March 1787 he was moved to the <i>Alexander</i>, one of the little squadron going out to New South Wales with Commodore Arthur Phillip, and served in her until her return to England in May 1789. He was then employed in the channel and the North Sea, and on 19 November 1790 was promoted lieutenant of the sloop <i>Speedy</i>. In January 1793 he was appointed to the frigate <i>Nemesis</i>, which accompanied the fleet under Lord Hood to the Mediterranean. In September 1794 he was moved into the <i>Romney</i>, with Sir Charles Hamilton whom, in April 1795, he followed to the <i>Melpomene</i>. On the night of 3&#150;4 August 1798 he commanded the boats of the frigate in cutting out the armed brig <i>Aventurier</i> from under the batteries in the Bay of Corr&eacute;jou, on the north coast of Brittany&#151;a gallant exploit, for which he was promoted commander on 20 April 1799 and appointed to the sloop <i>Voltigeur</i> on the Newfoundland station. In summer 1801 he was appointed temporarily to the 80-gun ship <i>Donegal</i>, then in dock at Plymouth, and, as a reward for his extraordinary exertions in fitting her for sea, he was made acting captain of the frigate <i>D&eacute;daigneuse</i> (36 guns; rank and command confirmed on 1 March 1802). He took her to the East Indies but was compelled by ill health to return to England in spring 1803. He was afterwards for a short time captain of the <i>Britannia</i> (100 guns), and of the <i>Caesar</i> (80 guns) bearing the flag of Sir Richard John Strachan.<br>
<br>In summer 1806 Shortland joined the <i>Canopus</i> (80 guns), as flag captain to Sir Thomas Louis and commanded her when she led the squadron of Sir John Thomas Duckworth through the Dardanelles in February and March 1807. After the death of Louis, Shortland continued for some months in command of the <i>Canopus</i>, but in September 1807 he was moved into the <i>Queen</i> (98 guns), still in the Mediterranean, and remained in her until the end of 1808. In 1809 he commanded the <i>Valiant</i> (74 guns) in the expedition to the Scheldt; in 1810&#150;11 the frigate <i>Iris</i>, off Cadiz and in the West Indies; and in 1812&#150;13 the <i>Royal Oak</i> (74 guns) as flag captain to Lord Amelius Beauclerk. In November 1813 he was appointed agent for prisoners of war at Dartmoor; from April 1816 to April 1819 he was captain-superintendent of the ordinary at Plymouth; and for the next three years he was comptroller-general of the preventive boat service. On 14 July 1825 he was appointed resident commissioner at Jamaica, where he died towards the end of 1827. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Peter Tonkin of Plymouth; they had a large family. Three of their sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25464/', "Edward Shortland")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25466/', "Peter Frederick Shortland")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25468/', "Willoughby Shortland")</script>, are separately noticed.<br>
