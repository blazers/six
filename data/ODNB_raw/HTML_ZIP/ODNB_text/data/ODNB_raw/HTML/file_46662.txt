<span class="headword">Trevor,  George Rice  Rice-</span>, fourth Baron Dynevor  (1795&#150;1869), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 5 August 1795, the eldest son of George Talbot Rice, third Baron Dynevor (1765&#150;1852), and his wife, Frances (1772&#150;1854), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27636/', "Thomas Townshend, first Viscount Sydney")</script>. George Talbot Rice used the surname De Cardonnell between 1793 and 1817. The younger George was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1812 but did not graduate. The Rice (or Rhys) family was descended from an old Welsh royal line; George Rice Rice, however, assumed the additional name of Trevor by royal licence (28 October 1824) on inheriting the estates of the Trevors of Glynde in Sussex. A month later, on 27 November 1824, he married Frances (1803&#150;1878), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9631/', "Lord Charles Fitzroy")</script>, with whom he produced four daughters but no male heir.<br>
<br>By this time, Trevor had entered parliament, being returned unopposed for Carmarthenshire on 16 March 1820. An unflinching tory, and a &#145;thick and thin Church of England man&#146;, he opposed both the emancipation of Catholics in 1829 and the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1831, resigning his seat at that year's general election knowing that he disagreed with a majority of his constituents on the matter. In 1832, however, with the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> a fact of life, he recaptured the seat, having first indicated that he supported the maintenance of the corn laws and a reduction in the malt tax. Although Trevor's parliamentary career was uneventful, his friendship with the duke of Wellington&#151;he received an honorary DCL on the occasion of the duke's election as chancellor of Oxford University in June 1834&#151;gave him a certain status in metropolitan Conservative circles.<br>
<br>Trevor's most important public role, however, came during the Rebecca riots, an outbreak of turnpike gate breaking which swept through south-west Wales in 1842&#150;4. The co-ordination of the official response to the disturbances fell to him when his ageing father, then lord lieutenant of Carmarthenshire, appointed him his vice-lieutenant. His response was uncompromising. He forced the county quarter sessions to establish a professional police force, called in troops of the 73rd infantry regiment and the 4th light dragoons, and worked closely with Colonel James Francis Love, commander of the south Wales military district, to restore order. Nor were the troops simply for show: he assured a meeting of magistrates at Newcastle Emlyn in June 1843 that he would order them to fire on the rioters if necessary. The response of the protesters was predictably fearsome: in September 1843, they audaciously dug a grave within sight of Dinefwr Castle, the family seat, and announced that Trevor would occupy it by 10 October. Trevor, however, surrounded by soldiers, survived unscathed.<br>
<br>Once tranquillity had been restored, through an upturn in the economy and an act of parliament which addressed the administration of the turnpike trusts, Trevor continued as county MP until 1852, when his father died. His succession to the title released him from a political life of increasing frustration: after the Conservative split of 1846 he confessed, &#145;I cannot join the staff of Lord George Bentinck, cannot place confidence in Sir Robert Peel, nor join the ranks of Lord John Russell&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dod's Parliamentary Companion</span>, 1847, 246). Although he attended the House of Lords regularly, voting consistently with the Conservative peers, he lost interest in Carmarthenshire politics, passing the administration of his interest to Lord Cawdor. In local affairs, however, he remained active, associating his name with useful projects such as the Carmarthen Literary and Scientific Institution and the Lifeboat Society.<br>
<br>His elevation to the House of Lords as fourth Baron Dynevor, in April 1852, coincided with his appointment as militia aide-de-camp to the queen, with the rank of colonel, and in August 1861, he was appointed honorary colonel of the Royal Carmarthen and Pembroke militia. Dynevor died at Great Malvern on 7 October 1869, from an attack of paralysis, and was interred in the family vault at Barrington Park, in Gloucestershire.<br>
