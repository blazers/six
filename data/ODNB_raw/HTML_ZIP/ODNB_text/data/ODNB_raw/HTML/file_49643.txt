</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fonteyn, Dame  Margot</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Margaret Evelyn Hookham; <em>married name </em>Margaret Evelyn  de Arias]</span>  (1919&#150;1991), <span class="occ">ballet dancer</span>, was born on 18 May 1919 at 49 London Road, Reigate, Surrey, the younger child and only daughter of Felix John Hookham (<i>b</i>. 1889), civil engineer, and his wife, Hilda Acheson, formerly Fontes (1894&#150;1988). Fonteyn claimed to have inherited her enthusiasm and response to music and rhythm from her half-Irish, half-Brazilian mother, and from her father the tenacity and perfectionism to exploit those qualities so as to become one of the great dancers of all time. <h2>
<a name="FirstdancingclassesandtheVicWellsSchool"></a>First dancing classes and the Vic-Wells School</h2>From the age of four Peggy attended dancing classes with Grace Bosustow in Ealing, where the family had moved. Bosustow luckily gave her not only a proper grounding but was able to tell her mother (the prime mover of her career) how to choose good teachers when Mr Hookham's new job with the British&#150;American Tobacco Company necessitated moving to the United States and then China. At first the liveliness of character-dancing attracted Peggy more than the pure classicism that later brought her fame, and she had no real ambition until inspired, on a visit home in 1931, by seeing Alicia Markova (the finest English ballerina before Fonteyn) in <span class="italic">Les sylphides</span>. The Hookhams were then living in Shanghai, where luckily they found an exceptionally talented teacher, the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; George Goncharov. He already had another English girl, June Brae (later Fonteyn's colleague at Sadler's Wells), as a pupil, whose seriousness fired Peggy to try harder, having grown used to being the best in her class. (Goncharov's partner Vera Volkova later became one of Fonteyn's most influential teachers in London.) After two years her mother brought her back to England, and she studied first with Markova's teacher Serafina Astafyeva before joining the Vic-Wells School. Within a few weeks she was performing with the Vic-Wells Ballet, and before the year was out had her first solo role, acting not dancing as the child in Ninette de Valois's <span class="italic">The Haunted Ballroom</span>, under an interim version of her stage name, Margot Fontes. She then took the name Fonteyn; her brother, Felix, a photographer specializing in dance, adopted it too. Before Fonteyn was sixteen Frederick Ashton gave her the surprisingly voluptuous leading part of the Creole girl in his <span class="italic">Rio Grande</span>; when Markova left the company soon afterwards, Fonteyn was one of the young dancers who shared the ballerina's roles among them. It did not take long for her (despite her own feelings of inadequacy) to emerge as the pick of the bunch, and by the time she was twenty Fonteyn had danced the lead in three of the great classics: <span class="italic">Giselle</span>, <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> and <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>. She had also created roles in a series of ballets by Ashton: the Fianc&eacute;e in <span class="italic">Le baiser de la f&eacute;e</span>, the captivating Woman in Ball-dress in <span class="italic">Apparitions</span>, the poor duped Flower-seller in <span class="italic">Nocturne</span>, forlorn Julia in <span class="italic">A Wedding Bouquet</span>, and the Young Woman in <span class="italic">Horoscope</span>. Ashton, whose muse had hitherto been Markova's more brittle precision and delicacy, wrote later (in <span class="italic">The Art of Margot Fonteyn</span>) of her innate musicality and wonderful physical proportions, her sense of line and beautiful arm movements, and that:<blockquote>Never once did she make a gesture which was not completely true; one that did not come from the heart. &hellip; Along with her other attributes she has a feminine warmth which readily communicates itself to an audience. &hellip; Had I not been able to work with Margot, I might never have developed the lyrical side of my work. (Money)</blockquote>Fonteyn was fortunate in the colleagues under whose professional influence she found herself. De Valois, directing the young company, had a far-sighted grasp of strategy in repertory and casting. Ashton not only developed Fonteyn's interpretative gifts but advised her how to dress and behave off-stage. Robert Helpmann, her most frequent partner, set the example of his keen theatrical flair, and the company's music director, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34382/', "(Leonard) Constant Lambert")</script>, a man of wide culture, took her particularly under his wing. Lambert and Fonteyn became lovers, but he ended their relationship gracelessly when he remarried, which perhaps explains why in her autobiography she failed to mention his artistic influence. <h2>
<a name="Wartimeandpostwarballet"></a>Wartime and post-war ballet</h2>The outbreak of the Second World War brought a more urgent tempo to the company's work. Instead of only two or three performances a week, they began dancing nightly, with matin&eacute;es besides, to entertain war workers and troops on leave; long, gruelling tours were made between short London seasons. The company, renamed Sadler's Wells Ballet, was in the Netherlands when the Germans invaded, and escaped with nothing more than what the dancers stood up in. Fonteyn by now was, at twenty, the undisputed ballerina, with a consequent demand for her to appear as often as possible. And there were new roles to add, notably two by Ashton which extended her range with the passion of <span class="italic">Dante Sonata</span> and the glitter of <span class="italic">The Wanderer</span>, besides another classic, <span class="italic">Copp&eacute;lia</span>, to which she brought a distinctive sense of humour.<br>
<br>This wartime experience helped develop the stamina that made Fonteyn's later career possible, but at the time it did more to consolidate her talent than to advance her artistry. The way she danced in <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span> when the company moved to Covent Garden in 1946 seemed impressive by the standards of the time. Luckily Ashton immediately created in <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span> a work showing Fonteyn's lyrical gifts to supreme advantage. Further important roles were as the Miller's Wife in <span class="italic">The Three-Cornered Hat</span> (dancing with its choreographer, L&eacute;onide Massine) and in Ashton's creation of the austerely evocative <span class="italic">Sc&egrave;nes de ballet</span>. Another turning point came in 1948, when she went to Paris to create the role of Agathe, the cat-woman (Fonteyn loved cats) in Roland Petit's <span class="italic">Les demoiselles de la nuit</span>. The frank admiration of this glamorous young choreographer, and being treated as a star, added a new assurance and crispness to everything she did on returning to London. The acclaim Fonteyn received in New York in the following year, opening the Sadler's Wells Ballet's first season there with <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>, completed the transformation into a ballerina of international quality.<br>
<br>Before the American tour an injury during the first night of Ashton's <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> had kept Fonteyn from the stage for several months and prevented her from dancing in the premi&egrave;re of his first three-act ballet, <span class="italic">Cinderella</span>. When she took over, however, she made the work specially her own, bringing out its qualities of humour and romance. This was soon followed by two of Fonteyn's greatest roles: the emotional depth and richness of <span class="italic">Daphnis and Chlo&euml;</span>, the drama, comedy, and classic display of <span class="italic">Sylvia</span>. Both were by Ashton but they were as different as could be.<br>
<br>Fonteyn's career was subsequently interrupted more than once by serious injury or illness that might have precipitated other dancers into early retirement, but she returned each time apparently stronger than before, and went on successfully long past the age when a dancer's powers usually decline. In Fonteyn the physical loss was compensated for by continually developing expressiveness and artistic maturity. <h2>
<a name="Marriageandwiderrecognition"></a>Marriage and wider recognition</h2>In 1955 Fonteyn married Dr Roberto Emilio de Arias (1918&#150;1989), son of Harmadio Arias, president of Panama from 1932 to 1936, and his wife, Rosario Guardia de Arias. He was a sweetheart of Fonteyn's girlhood who had married and had a family before re-entering her life. A lawyer and politician in his native Panama, he was immediately after their wedding appointed ambassador to the court of St James. Fonteyn managed to combine the duties of an ambassador's wife with her already demanding career, although she revealed otherwise little concern for politics (she was criticized for dancing in South Africa during a dancers' union ban over apartheid, and she happily accepted invitations from Imelda Marcos, wife of the right-wing Philippine president). When Arias fell from political favour she supported his attempts to regain power in Panama, even to the point of being arrested and deported during one of his attempted coups, an experience she bore with calm dignity, as she did also an occasion in 1967 when she and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53196/', "Rudolf Nureyev")</script> were held in custody in San Francisco after attending a party where some of the guests had used drugs.<br>
<br>Shortly before Fonteyn's wedding Ninette de Valois told her that she had been chosen to become president of the Royal Academy of Dancing (an international body responsible for teaching standards in ballet) in succession to its founder president, Adeline Gen&eacute;e. When she found her reluctance to accept the post firmly overruled, Fonteyn refused to treat it as a sinecure, and to her other responsibilities she added frequent meetings, oversight of a new syllabus, and the organization of annual fund-raising galas.<br>
<br>In 1956 Fonteyn, having been created CBE five years earlier, was promoted to DBE. That same year, seeing the Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova as Juliet during the Bolshoi Ballet's first London season was a stimulus for Fonteyn; at last she could understand what Ashton had always said about the extraordinary speed of Anna Pavlova, and try to emulate it. Another Russian former ballerina much admired by Ashton, Tamara Karsavina, also helped from 1954 by coaching her in <span class="italic">The Firebird</span> and other roles. But during the later 1950s, troubled by a painful left foot, Fonteyn began to think longingly of retirement, and more so when Michael Somes, her most regular partner since Helpmann's retirement ten years earlier, and well suited to her by his musicality, relinquished all his parts needing strong technique. Fonteyn even for a time gave up her most demanding ballet, <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span>, with its double role for the ballerina. She was worried that this might lead to a general decline in her ability, although reassured when Ashton created another long ballet for her, <span class="italic">Ondine</span>, a fluent role that gave her special pleasure. <h2>
<a name="Nureyev"></a>Nureyev</h2>The most vital impetus to extending Fonteyn's career came in 1962 when de Valois invited Rudolf Nureyev, newly settled in the West, to dance with what had by now become the Royal Ballet, and offered Fonteyn the opportunity of dancing with him in <span class="italic">Giselle</span> for his d&eacute;but. She had reservations because of the difference in age (she forty-two, he only twenty-three) but decided she must accept to maintain her pre-eminence. In fact they went wonderfully together, each inspiring the other and able to learn from the experience. Thus began possibly the greatest of all ballet partnerships: two dancers, both individually superb, who raised each other to new heights. Their immediate rapport, the chemistry between them on stage, and the unanimity of purpose in preparation gave their performances together a uniquely satisfying quality. Besides, both learned so much from the other in matters of style, emotional understanding, and presentation that their work with other partners benefited too. Nureyev's analytical understanding of technique and its physical basis also helped Fonteyn to overcome difficulties she had experienced, for instance with fouett&eacute;s.<br>
<br>Fonteyn's long career on stage was made easier because her dancing never depended primarily on virtuosity, although her technique was stronger than was often said&#151;by herself among others. It was she who introduced the long, sustained balances now expected of Aurora in the &#145;Rose adagio&#146; of <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>. Notably, too, when younger dancers took over some of the roles created for Fonteyn, they revealed unexpected difficulties, apparently because they lacked her gift of phrasing steps to the music. Certainly Fonteyn never lacked the technique for any role in which she was cast. These covered a vast range. Besides the many ballets created for her by Ashton, other choreographers who made roles for her were as varied as de Valois in her seriously dramatic <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>; John Cranko, whose <span class="italic">Po&egrave;me de l'extase</span> with the Stuttgart Ballet was inspired by Skryabin's music, the paintings of Klimt, and a Colette novel to show Fonteyn the mature woman; Peter Darrell, who presented her as a Beardsley seductress in <span class="italic">Scarlet Pastorale</span> with the Scottish Ballet; and even the American contemporary dance pioneer Martha Graham, who mounted <span class="italic">Lucifer</span> for Nureyev and Fonteyn.<br>
<br>The greatest dramatic experience of the Fonteyn&#150;Nureyev partnership was <span class="italic">Marguerite and Armand</span>, where Ashton adapted the story of Margu&eacute;rite Gautier into a series of flashbacks to a Liszt sonata. Fonteyn's role in this ranged, within a few minutes, from the smiling cynosure of all male eyes at a party, through her sickness, her happiness in the country, her self-sacrifice, the bitterness (shown in the inimitably painful dragging of her feet) of rejection and insult, to the final reconciliation coming tragically too late; all set against the feverish intensity of Nureyev's Armand and the stubborn dignity of Somes as the father.<br>
<br>Fonteyn and Nureyev were, against her wishes and those of the choreographer, but at the insistence of the Royal Ballet's American impresario, the first to play the title roles in Kenneth MacMillan's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, which had been meant for two of MacMillan's previous collaborators. Mostly, however, it was the old classics in which Fonteyn and Nureyev repeatedly played together. Both, for instance, were unmatched in giving theatrical point to Petipa's sublime dances for <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span> (although, surprisingly, she claimed it was the ballet she least liked). In <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> she amazingly got better and better, not by elaborating but by simplifying so as to strip the role down to its essence. When Nureyev added unfamiliar classics to the Royal Ballet's repertory (the Shades scene from <span class="italic">La bayad&egrave;re</span>, <span class="italic">Raymonda</span>, the <i>pas de deux</i> from the <span class="italic">Corsair</span>) and invented his own <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> in Vienna, he insisted that Fonteyn had to be the ballerina, and deliberately gave her solos she would find difficult, to spur her to new discoveries.<br>
<br>With the Royal Ballet Fonteyn occupied a position of complete supremacy. It was sometimes suggested that her presence held back the progress of other dancers, but there was never among her contemporaries or juniors anyone to equal her. By 1959 the demand for seats when she appeared was such that special prices were charged, and in that same year she began to be billed as a guest artist so that she would be free to accept more of the other engagements she was offered worldwide. Nevertheless the Royal Ballet remained her base until Ashton, who had succeeded de Valois as director, retired in 1970, although she also danced with more than thirty other companies and specially assembled groups. <h2>
<a name="Finalperformances"></a>Final performances</h2>From 1964, when Dr Arias was shot and paralysed by a colleague whom he was alleged to have cuckolded, Fonteyn had an extra incentive to go on working for his medical bills; she remained devoted to his well-being and took him in a wheelchair on most of her journeys. To mark her sixtieth birthday in May 1979 the Royal Ballet gave a gala in her honour, including a <span class="italic">Salut d'amour</span> by Ashton which he danced with her. She also danced with her old partner Helpmann in the &#145;Tango&#146; of Ashton's <span class="italic">Fa&ccedil;ade</span>, and at the end of the performance the Royal Ballet gave her, uniquely, the official title of prima ballerina assoluta. This had been widely assumed to be her farewell, but after that she took on another new role as the leading nymph in Nijinsky's <span class="italic">L'apr&egrave;s-midi d'un faune</span> during Nureyev's 1979 summer season, for which he also persuaded her to resume the Girl in <span class="italic">Le spectre de la rose</span>. From time to time thereafter she appeared on special occasions, but only in parts that required no steps; her last time on stage was as the Queen in <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span> with Birmingham Royal Ballet in Miami in February 1986.<br>
<br>In later years Fonteyn settled in a small house with no telephone in a remote village in Panama, where Arias had a farm, and that remained her home after his death on 22 November 1989. She had few comforts, having spent most of her money on caring for him, but she found a real interest in cattle farming. She fell ill with cancer, but still undertook some teaching and coaching. She also continued visiting England each year, for the assembly of the Royal Academy of Dancing and to attend the degree ceremony at Durham University, which had elected her its chancellor in 1982. This honour was offered unexpectedly and she said that she accepted with awe, but she threw herself wholeheartedly into its duties, astonishing the academics with the fluency and passion for education revealed in her speech, delivered without notes, at her installation in Durham Cathedral.<br>
<br>Fonteyn's own general education had been repeatedly interrupted by putting dance first, but that did not prevent her writing several books. The most ambitious was based on a six-part television series which she wrote, introduced, and starred in, called <span class="italic">The Magic of Dance</span> (1980; BBC television series 1979). There were also an autobiography (1975), a study of Pavlova (1984), and <span class="italic">A Dancer's World</span> (1978), explaining the nature of a ballet career.<br>
<br>Because Fonteyn was known to have exhausted her savings on hospital bills for her husband and then for herself, Covent Garden gave a gala for her benefit in May 1990 at which the tenor Placido Domingo volunteered to sing, and Somes and Nureyev took small parts in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, before an audience determined to demonstrate its admiration and affection for the guest of honour. She died in Panama City nine months later, on 21 February 1991, and was buried near her village home. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 2 July 1991.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Many dancers excelled Fonteyn in virtuosity or their theatrical intensity in dramatic roles. Her special gift was for grasping completely the intention and balance of the dance and the music and bringing them to life for the audience. She never lost the joyousness which marked her dancing from childhood, and the ability to communicate that was perhaps the supreme secret of her art. During an extraordinarily long career she brought her gifts to ever wider audiences in many parts of the world on stage; millions more saw her on television or in films. Consequently, even more than Anna Pavlova in the early years of the century, Fonteyn awakened a love of dance in untold thousands of spectators. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>)</blockquote>
