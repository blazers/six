<span class="headword">Pellatt,  Apsley</span>  (1791&#150;1863), <span class="occ">glass manufacturer</span>, was the eldest son of Apsley Pellatt (<i>d</i>. 1826) and Mary, daughter of Stephen Maberly of Reading. He was born on 27 November 1791, probably at 80 High Holborn, London, where his father kept a glass warehouse. Pellatt was educated by Dr Wanostrocht at Camberwell, and joined his father in business. He was twice married: first, in 1814, to Sophronia, daughter of George Kemp of Reading (she died in February 1815); second, in 1816, to Margaret Elizabeth, daughter of George Evans of Balham.<br>
<br>In 1819 Pellatt took out a patent for a process learned from a foreign source, &#145;crystallo-ceramie or glass incrustation&#146;, which consisted in enclosing medallions or ornaments of pottery ware, metal, or refractory material in glass, by which very beautiful ornamental effects were produced. The new process was described by the inventor with illustrations in his <span class="italic">Memoir on the Origin, Progress, and Improvement of Glass Manufactures</span> (1821). He took out a patent in 1831 for improvements in the manufacture of pressed glass articles, and another in 1845, with his brother, Frederick, for improvements in the composition of glass, and in the methods of blowing, pressing, and casting glass articles. In 1851 he discovered the Venetian secret art of making &#145;crackle-glass&#146;. Under his care the products of the family's Falcon glassworks in Southwark attained a high reputation both for quality and artistic design. He devoted much time to the investigation of the principles of glass making both in ancient and modern times, and he became a high authority upon the subject. His book <span class="italic">Curiosities of Glass Making</span> (1849) comprised the text of his earlier memoir, his lectures on the manufacture of flint glass, delivered to the Royal Institution, and the fruits of his various researches. He was a commissioner for the Great Exhibition of 1851 and a juror for the 1862 exhibition, for which he wrote the report on the glass manufactures displayed. He travelled widely on business, visiting glassworks at Venice, Nievelt in Bohemia, Li&egrave;ge, and Baccarat, where he was welcomed by colleagues whom he had previously invited to tour his own factory. His knowledge of chemistry and art led to his serving on the council of the School of Design for seven years and he regularly attended its meetings.<br>
<br>Pellatt was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1838, and in 1840 he became a member of the council. He contributed in 1838 and 1840 papers on the manufacture of glass, which were printed in volume 1 of the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> (1838, 39; and 1840, 37&#150;41), and he was a frequent speaker at meetings of the institution.<br>
<br>Besides his work as a glass maker, Pellatt took a great interest in public affairs. He was for several years a member of common council for the City of London, during which time he successfully campaigned for Jews to be admitted freemen of the City, which would entitle them to keep shops and enjoy other privileges from which they alone were excluded. His views were published in 1829 as <span class="italic">A Brief Memoir of the Jews in Relation to their Civil and Municipal Disabilities</span>. When he moved to Southwark, he was concerned with the improvement of drains and sewers in that district. He was actively involved in restricting Sunday trading, and gave evidence in favour of this to the House of Commons select committee on Sunday observance in 1832. His concern for social welfare manifested itself in his service and benefactions to the British Orphan School, the London Female Penitentiary, and many other institutions.<br>
<br>Pellatt represented Southwark in parliament as a Liberal from July 1852 until the general election in March 1857, but was unsuccessful in the elections of 1857 and 1859. He was a frequent speaker in the Commons, and he introduced a bill for facilitating dissenters' marriages in 1854, 1855, and 1856. In 1856 he brought in a bill to define the law as to crossed cheques, which was passed (19 &amp; 20 Vict. 25). He was a prominent member of the Congregational body.<br>
<br>From 1843 Pellatt lived at Staines, where he established a model farm. He died of paralysis, on 17 April 1863, after little more than a week's illness, at the house of his brother-in-law at Balham. His wife and three daughters survived him, his only son having died about 1839.<br>
