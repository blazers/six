<span class="headword">Skeffington,  Clotworthy</span>, second earl of Massereene  (1742&#150;1805), <span class="occ">landowner and debtor</span>, was the son of Clotworthy Skeffington, sixth viscount and first earl of Massereene (<i>d</i>. 1757), and his second wife, Anne, daughter of Henry Eyre of Rowter, Derbyshire. He was born on 28 January 1742 in Antrim and was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. From 1756 he was known as Lord Loughneagh, until 1757, when he succeeded to his father's title. The Skeffingtons were a notable Irish political family, of old protestant lineage, with major landholdings in Antrim, which included the manor of Moylinny. They had a group allegiance in parliament, based on the Antrim town borough seats, although Massereene's financial difficulties meant that control of the borough was temporarily devolved upon Lord Antrim. As a group they were generally unsympathetic towards patriotism, particularly after the viceroy, Lord Harcourt, rewarded them in 1775.<br>
<br>It appears that Massereene's mental capacity had been damaged by a fall from a horse. This may have contributed to his willingness to become involved in disastrous financial speculations, which resulted in his imprisonment in France in 1770. His mother refused to send money to pay for his release, in the mistaken belief that this would force Massereene, who had a reputation as an extravagant man of fashion, to manage his financial affairs more carefully. While in the debtors' prison of Fort-l'Ev&ecirc;que he continued to spend lavishly, and after an early attempt to escape&#151;foiled by the bad faith of a turnkey&#151;he settled down to live his prison life in luxury. However, his own depiction of life in La Force, to which he had been transferred in 1780, was much more melancholy. He complained that he was shut up in solitude &#145;save for the vermin and a mouse which I taught to come for food&#146;. He described himself as &#145;imprisoned abroad, robbed at home, misrepresented everywhere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leeds MSS</span>, 22.56). On 13 July 1789, the eve of the fall of the Bastille, he was liberated by the Paris crowd, and he left the prison accompanied by Marie Anne Barcier, the daughter of the prison governor, whom he subsequently married. After presenting himself at the British embassy, Massereene took refuge in the precincts of the Temple, a privileged spot for debtors. But on finding himself in no danger of rearrest, he proceeded to Calais. After narrowly escaping detention he made his way back to England, and then travelled onwards to Ireland. Ironically Lord Massereene's motto on his coat of arms was &#145;through difficulties to honour&#146;.<br>
<br>At St Peter Cornhill, London, Massereene formally married Marie Anne Barcier, on 19 August 1789, although he was said to have already married her twice while in France. She died in 1800 and he subsequently married Elizabeth Lane (<i>d</i>. 1838). He also formed a relationship with a servant in London, whose discretion was purchased at great cost after his death. None of these unions produced children. He died on 28 February 1805 at Antrim Castle.<br>
<br>Massereene's descendants included <a name="cosubject_25657"></a><span class="headword">John Skeffington Foster Skeffington</span>, tenth Viscount Massereene and third Viscount Ferrard  (1812&#150;1863), <span class="occ">poet</span>, the son of Thomas Foster, second Viscount Ferrard, and Harriet, daughter of Chichester Skeffington, ninth Viscount Massereene. He was born in Dublin on 30 November 1812 and was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He succeeded his mother as Viscount Massereene, and his father as Viscount Ferrard in 1834, at the same time assuming Skeffington as an additional surname. He was created knight of St Patrick on 3 July 1851. He married on 1 August 1835 Olivia, fourth daughter of Henry Deane Grady of Stillorgan Castle, co. Dublin; they had four sons and four daughters. He was the author of <span class="italic">O'Sullivan, the Bandit Chief: a Romantic Poem</span> (4 vols., 1844), <span class="italic">Church Melodies</span> (8 vols., 1847), <span class="italic">A Metrical Version of the Psalms</span> (8 vols., 1865), and <span class="italic">The Love of God: a Poem</span> (8 vols., 1868). He died at Antrim Castle on 28 April 1863.<br>
