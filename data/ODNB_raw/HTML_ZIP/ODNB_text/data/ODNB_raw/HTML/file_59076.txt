<span class="headword">Spencer,  (Charles) Bernard</span>  (1909&#150;1963), <span class="occ">poet and broadcaster</span>, was born on 9 November 1909 in Madras, India, the third of three children of Charles Gordon Spencer (1869&#150;1934), a high court judge in the Indian Civil Service who was later knighted, and Edith Mary (<i>d</i>. 1936), daughter of Colonel Hugh Pearce Pearson, of the Indian army.<br>
<br>In 1911 Bernard, as he was habitually known, joined his brother, John (<i>b</i>. 1907), and sister, Cynthia (<i>b</i>. 1904), in England, where he was brought up by relatives and guardians in Hampshire and Oxfordshire. Spencer's education followed an expected course for a young man of his background. He attended Heddon Court preparatory school in Stevenage and Marlborough College (1923&#150;7), where his contemporaries included Louis MacNeice, John Betjeman, and Anthony Blunt. Aesthete rather than athlete, he filled his spare hours at Marlborough with poetry and painting, and pursued these interests at Corpus Christi College, Oxford (1928&#150;32), where he read classics. He contributed poems, reviews, and art criticism to <span class="italic">Oxford Outlook</span>, and in 1930 co-edited the influential annual <span class="italic">Oxford Poetry</span> with Stephen Spender. Spencer left university with a third class in classical moderations and a second in Greats and no clear ambitions. From 1932 to 1940 he held temporary posts teaching at preparatory schools in London and the home counties, all the while continuing to publish poems in periodicals and anthologies. His pre-war reputation as a junior member of the Auden generation was secured with contributions to <span class="italic">New Verse</span>, the most important poetry magazine of the 1930s, where he also served as assistant editor under Geoffrey Grigson from 1935 to 1938. He confirmed a quiet but resolute rebellion against class expectations by marrying a repertory actress, Nora Kathleen Gibbs (1909/10&#150;1947), on 1 August 1936.<br>
<br>Spencer's first British Council appointment, in January 1940, as a lecturer at the Institute of English Studies in Salonika, changed his life and art. He discovered the major inspiration for his poetry, the Mediterranean south, the cultures and landscapes of this &#145;explosive, crushed-blue, nostril-opening sea&#146;  (Spencer, 19). Poems like &#145;Delos&#146;, &#145;Aegean Islands, 1940&#150;41&#146;, and &#145;Greek Excavations&#146; explore the region's ancient past, often identifying the melancholy continuities of history, as they celebrate the tactile immediacy of a living world. Greece also offered him a more cosmopolitan literary circle, with his fellow British exile Lawrence Durrell, and, in the vanguard of contemporary Greek poetry, George Seferis and Odysseus Elytis. The German invasion cut short Spencer's idyll, and he was evacuated in January 1941 to Egypt, where he spent the war years teaching at Fuad I University in Cairo. He, Durrell, and Robin Fedden edited <span class="italic">Personal Landscape</span> from 1942 to 1945, &#145;one of the rare &#147;little&#148; magazines that have made literary history in our time&#146;  (Lehmann, 339). The editors enshrined a distinctive poetry of exile, at once modernist and European, with the best of their own work, many of the important war poems of Keith Douglas, as well as translations of Rilke and Cavafy, and contributions from Seferis.<br>
<br>In London after the Second World War, Spencer did occasional broadcasting as a presenter, reader, and scriptwriter for the BBC Third Programme and the Home Service, but the expatriate life had taken a hold, and the particular allure of the Mediterranean beckoned once again. Spencer secured an appointment with the permanent overseas service of the British Council and was posted to Palermo in September 1946, the year that his first volume of poems, <span class="italic">Aegean Islands</span>, appeared. His duties in Sicily came to an abrupt end when his wife succumbed to tuberculosis and died in Rome on 13 June 1947. After three months working at the British Institute in Turin, Spencer, now suffering from the disease himself, underwent treatment at a clinic in Leysin, Switzerland. A long convalescence delayed a new assignment until September 1949, when he was posted to the British Institute in Madrid. Spencer served there until 1955, returning in 1958 for another four years after two interludes teaching in Athens (1955&#150;6) and Ankara (1958). He adapted well to the western end of the Mediterranean as he had before to the Aegean. With his trim figure, casual elegance, and patrician good looks, he was a popular teacher, wry, self-deprecatory, and an elegant raconteur. His reputation as good company had followed him from pre-war London to Greece to Egypt, and now to Spain.<br>
<br>Spencer was never prolific, and he could be reticent about publication, but in the last five years of his life there was a new creative energy at work. His second and third volumes, <span class="italic">The Twist in the Plotting</span> and <span class="italic">With Luck Lasting</span>, appeared in 1960 and 1963 respectively. These later poems, vivid with sensuous particulars, record both the anomie and the unexpected miracles of urban life. During his second posting to Spain he met Anne Margaret Helen Marjoribanks (<i>b</i>. 1938), an English teacher and secretary at the time of marriage, whom he married in Madrid on 29 September 1961. His final posting, in January 1962, was to Vienna. Despite the unaccustomed distance from &#145;the promise of the South&#146;  (Spencer, 34), it was a hopeful time. His only child, Piers Bernard, was born there in July 1963, and a collected edition was planned. What seemed like a new beginning was once again undone. In the summer of 1963 he began to suffer from blackouts and memory loss, and on 10 September, now seriously ill, he was admitted to a clinic for tests. He apparently wandered away, undetected, and was found dead the following morning on a railway line in Vienna, having been struck by a train. The nature of his illness and the exact circumstances of his death have never been established. He was cremated on 17 September in Vienna, and his ashes were returned to England, where they lie beside his parents' grave in the estate church of Wheatfield House, Wheatfield, Oxfordshire. He was survived by his wife, Anne.<br>
<br>Bernard Spencer's <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was published in 1965, and a substantially expanded volume appeared in 1981. Approximately 100 poems appear in the later edition, and show the continuity of his vision over thirty years and the landscapes of seven countries. Spencer's very rootlessness&#151;he was always the alert stranger&#151;offered a bracing alternative to the dictates of settled metropolitan taste. He is a poet of exact momentary observation and of the long historical view, and that apparent paradox is his great strength.<br>
