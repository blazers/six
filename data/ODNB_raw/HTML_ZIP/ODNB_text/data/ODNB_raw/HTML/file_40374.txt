<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Swan <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Burnett Smith]</span>,  Annie Shepherd</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>David Lyall]</span>  (1859&#150;1943), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 8 July 1859 in Edinburgh, the daughter of Edward Swan (<i>d</i>. 1893), a farmer and potato merchant, and his first wife, Euphemia Brown (<i>d</i>. 1881). After the failure of her father's business in Berwickshire, Swan's life was divided between Mountskip Farm, near Gorebridge, Midlothian, and Maryfield, Easter Road, Edinburgh, where she attended a dame-school and later Queen Street Ladies' College. Her father was a member of Duke Street Chapel, an Evangelical Union congregation, but in adulthood Swan became a member of the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Swan's teenage persistence in writing fiction was rewarded when <span class="italic">Wrongs Righted</span> (1881) was published serially in the <span class="italic">People's Friend</span>, establishing her profitable association with the publisher John Leng. The success of <span class="italic">Aldersyde</span> (1883), the novel which made her reputation, was assured when William Gladstone wrote a letter in its praise to <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (his letter was published in facsimile in the second edition of the novel). She was throughout her life a pronounced Liberal and campaigner for Liberal causes.<br>
<br>On 27 December 1883 Swan married James Burnett Smith (1857&#150;1927), a schoolteacher, and set up home in Star, Markinch, two years later moving to Morningside, Edinburgh, where Burnett Smith became a medical student at Edinburgh University, Swan paying his way through university. Swan confirmed her success with <span class="italic">The Gates of Eden</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">Maitland of Laurieston</span> (1891), novels modelled on the fiction of Margaret Oliphant but never rivalling Oliphant's literary complexity. It is estimated that during her career Swan &#145;wrote 162 novels under her own name and at least forty under the male pseudonym David Lyall&#146;  (Dickson, 329). Shortly after her husband's graduation, Swan achieved her ambition of moving to London, initially to 52 Camden Square, where her children were born: Effie on 10 January 1893 (<i>d</i>. 15 October 1973) and Eddie in 1896. Later the family moved to 252 Finchley Road, Hampstead.<br>
<br>Swan's prolific output was the result of rising at 6 a.m. and writing 3000 words which she never redrafted. She was much in demand for press interviews and because of her ability as a public speaker received invitations to speak for London city missions and, later in life, the Liberal Party, standing unsuccessfully as a candidate for Maryhill, Glasgow, in 1922.<br>
<br>William Robertson Nicoll, founder of the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span> made Swan chief contributor to <span class="italic">Annie Swan's Magazine</span> and its agony aunt in the feature &#145;Over the teacups&#146;. Swan also wrote for the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span>, becoming acquainted with S. R. Crockett and J. M. Barrie whose fiction along with Swan's earned the lasting opprobrium of the Scottish literary establishment who damned it as &#145;kailyard&#146;, summing up their disgust with its parochialism and sentimentality.<br>
<br>In 1908, the Burnett Smiths moved to Hertford, where in September 1910 Eddie died after shooting himself accidentally. The family was devastated and Swan experimented briefly with spiritualism guided by W. T. Stead. During the First World War she went to France on a morale-boosting tour and also worked with Belgian refugees. Her home, the North House, was bombed in 1915. Invited by the Ministry of Information, Swan toured the United States in 1918 to explain the extent of British food shortages.<br>
<br>When Burnett Smith retired, the family moved to Bandrum, Fife, where Swan wrote <span class="italic">The Pendulum</span> (1926). Her success depended on her precise knowledge of the values of her mass readership, being regarded as an eminently &#145;safe&#146; author who affirmed the values of the nonconformist conscience. <span class="italic">The Pendulum's</span> critique of these values provoked hostility among her readership demonstrating the extent to which the relation between writer and reader was one of consent rather than control. Swan never wrote another novel like it.<br>
<br>When James Burnett Smith died in 1927, Swan and her daughter moved to Gullane, East Lothian, where she was still in public demand: one journalist recorded that she was &#145;a charming woman, neat of foot, grey-haired, shingled, dressed in stylish mourning, with a quick smile&#146;; another that she was &#145;plain, plump and motherly&#146;  (NL Scot. accession 6003, box 2, folder 3a). She was made a CBE in 1930. Swan died of heart disease at Aldersyde, Gullane, on 17 June 1943 and was buried in Kinghorn, Fife.<br>
