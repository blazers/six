<span class="headword">Kidd,  Samuel</span>  (1804&#150;1843), <span class="occ">missionary in Malacca and Chinese scholar</span>, was born on 22 November 1804 at Welton, near Hull, and was educated at the village school in Welton. In 1818 he was sent to Hull, where his thoughts were directed towards a missionary career, and in 1820 he entered the London Missionary Society's training college at Gosport. In April 1824 he married Hannah, second daughter of William Irving of Hull. At the end of the same month he was sent by the London Missionary Society to Madras, and thence to the college at Malacca, where he arrived in November 1824. David Collie, the principal, taught him Chinese and he soon spoke Hokkien and Mandarin. In the course of 1826 he published several small tracts in Chinese, and in the year following he was appointed professor of Chinese at the college. On Collie's death in 1828 Kidd succeed him as principal. He became involved in a row between the East India Company and the <span class="italic">Malacca Observer</span>, which was printed on the college's press.<br>
<br>Exhausted by this and by epileptic fits, to which he had become prone, Kidd returned to Britain in 1832 (his wife Hannah having returned for reasons of health in 1829). His health did not improve and in 1833 he was appointed pastor of a Congregational church at Manningtree in Essex. In 1837 he was appointed professor of Chinese at University College, London, at &pound;60 p.a. for a term of five years. The chair, which was the first professorship of Chinese in Britain, had been founded in 1837 when University College accepted the gift of Robert Morrison's Chinese library, and Kidd was its first holder. He wrote a memoir of Robert Morrison in 1838, published his inaugural lecture (also in 1838) and <span class="italic">China, or, Illustrations of the Philosophy, Government and Literature of the Chinese</span> (1841); he also catalogued the Chinese library of the Royal Asiatic Society. It was understood at the time of his nomination to his chair that his appointment would be renewed at the end of that term, and Kidd requested a further five-year term, pointing out that he suffered &#145;considerable personal expense&#146; in holding the chair  (College correspondence, 1843, UCL Archives). Renewal was not immediately granted, and it was while the matter was in debate that Kidd died suddenly on 12 June 1843, at his house in Camden Town, London.<br>
