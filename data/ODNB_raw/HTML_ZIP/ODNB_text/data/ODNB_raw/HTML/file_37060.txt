<span class="headword">Yeats,  John Butler <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1871&#150;1957), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 29 August 1871 in London, at 23 Fitzroy Road, north of Regent's Park, the fifth child and youngest son of the painter John Butler Yeats (1839&#150;1922) and Susan Mary Pollexfen (1841&#150;1900). He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37061/', "William Butler Yeats (1865&#150;1939)")</script>. He never used the name Butler, only the initial B, and in his early years was known as Johnnie. Both his parents were of Irish protestant families. The Yeatses were impoverished gentlefolk with pretensions to some landholding in Thomastown, co. Kilkenny, which was lost through John Butler Yeats's bad management; they settled in Dublin in the mid-nineteenth century. At that time the Pollexfens were a merchant family established in Sligo in the milling and shipping business.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Jack Yeats spent his early years both in London and in Sligo. His father, who trained as a barrister, became an artist in London and had moved the family there after the birth of the eldest child, William Butler Yeats. He was unsuccessful as a painter, and the family, who faced shortages of money, lived in various lodgings. This persuaded his wife to spend lengthy periods of time with her parents in Sligo. Jack Yeats's early experiences were of travel, and his love of the sea, which was to inspire many of his paintings, developed during voyages in his grandfather's ships from Liverpool round the northern coast of Ireland to Sligo.<br>
<br>By the age of nine Jack had settled in Sligo in the care of his grandparents, an arrangement that was to last until he went to art school in 1887. He claimed that Sligo was a formative influence in his life and that he rarely painted a picture &#145;without a bit of Sligo in it&#146;. He worked hard at school, was competitive and successful in most subjects (contrary to the opinion voiced by his father), and showed an early facility in drawing, particularly in caricature. He was a happy child, in marked contrast with his brother, William Butler Yeats, who was moody and introspective, and rather frightened of his grandfather. Jack, on the other hand, was particularly fond of William Pollexfen, and seems to have exercised a youthful authority over this powerful and forbidding man of the sea. In his youth Pollexfen had commanded a coaster called the <i>Dasher</i>, and he told Jack stories about the sea and pirates that inspired his early drawings, his plays for children, and his later paintings, many of which show an outstanding grasp of seafaring life. Of his vast output of paintings, watercolours, and drawings a very substantial number draw their inspiration and subject matter directly from the Sligo life. The powerful, bearded figure of a seafaring man often features in his work.<br>
<br>Unlike his brother and sisters Jack Yeats was surrounded by comfort and security, lived in a large house with servants and grooms, and travelled about with his grandfather in a pony and trap. He returned to London to enrol as an art student in 1887, first at the South Kensington School of Art, under Professor Brown, and then at Chiswick School of Art, in Bedford Park, to which area the family had moved. He is recorded as being at the West London School of Art from 1890 to 1893 and also at the Westminster School of Art from 1890 to 1894. Yeats, however, found nothing strange about studying in a number of institutions, but he did find quite uncongenial the straitened circumstances at home. These included the burden of having to contribute to the family income. He escaped into the world of his own art and into the entertainment world of the Buffalo Bill Cody shows at Earls Court, near one of the houses in which the family lodged, and drew cowboy subjects obsessively. While an art student he witnessed the efforts of his brother and two sisters to earn money to keep the family together, and by 1888 he was himself contributing drawings to publications such as <span class="italic">The Vegetarian</span>. He was also privately commissioned to design menus and doilies, and he began selling drawings directly through a shop in Piccadilly. He was influenced in his early work by Randolph Caldecott and Phil May, and also greatly admired the art of Thomas Hood. He led an independent existence at Bedford Park and was the least troubled of the Yeats children. He had a great sense of fun and got on well with everyone, with the possible exception of his father, towards whom he displayed reserve on account of the blame that he placed on his father's head for the failing health of his mother, who found the family's tribulations too much to bear.<h2>
<a name="Marriage"></a>Marriage</h2>In the early 1890s Yeats determined on marriage. He had met Mary Cottenham (Cottie) White (<i>c</i>.1869&#150;1948) in 1889; she was a fellow student at Chiswick and came from a well-to-do family with Isle of Man connections. In 1891 he announced his intentions to his father and was released from financial obligations to the family, since he was now saving for his own and Cottie's future. He was already surprisingly successful as a freelance illustrator and comic artist, and as a sporting artist recording athletics and racing scenes around the country. In the years when all the members of the Yeats family contributed to the expenses of running the home his contribution tended to outstrip that of his siblings.<br>
<br>Jack and Cottie were married on 23 August 1894 in Gunnersbury and went on honeymoon to Dawlish. They moved into a house in Chertsey, and Jack continued to find employment as an illustrator in both freelance and regular commissioned work: Cottie was also an accomplished painter in watercolours. Though they lived frugally they enjoyed additional income through a family settlement made on Cottie during her lifetime. Within a year they had decided to move to the west of England. The Pollexfens had originally come from Devon, and Jack discovered an old and dilapidated cottage in Strete, 4 miles south of Dartmouth. It was reconstructed, more land was acquired, and an old barn was repaired as a studio overlooking the Gara river. It took almost two years to complete the move to Strete.<h2>
<a name="Earlyexhibitions"></a>Early exhibitions</h2>In their new home Yeats prepared for his first exhibition, which was held in London's Clifford Galleries late in 1897. Much of the work consisted of drawings and watercolours of life in the west of England. Scenes of racing, boxing, fairgrounds, cider-making, children, and animals made up a substantial number of works, and the critical success was resounding. In <span class="italic">Table Talk</span> P. G. Konody wrote: &#145;quite apart from the exquisite humour of these sketches, there is another reason which makes them quite remarkable and worthy of attention. They show an astounding capacity for grasping and retaining the impression of certain short moments&#146; (Arnold, 68; a good example is <span class="italic">Waiting</span>, reproduced in Arnold, p. 69, fig 72). Thirty-nine individual publications noticed the show, many of them warmly praising the talent of the drawing and the life in the subject matter. Over a quarter of the works shown were sold, and Yeats's talent was noticed by the playwright and patron of the arts Augusta, Lady Gregory. She was on the lookout for Irish artistic talent and wanted Yeats, like his brother, to become involved in the Irish artistic revival of the late nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Initially Yeats had no intention of returning to Ireland; his wife did not favour the idea, and he was reticent about a literary movement that was becoming dominated by his elder brother. He did return, however, to work, and travelled in the west of Ireland, painting in watercolours and filling sketchbooks with anecdotal drawings of people and places. He loved the odd and the unusual. Fights, disputes&#151;such as <span class="italic">Let me See Wan Fight!</span> (reproduced Arnold, p. 79, fig. 84)&#151;parades, circus giants and dwarfs, and above all scenes at race meetings and fairs repeatedly captured his imagination and provided him not only with subject matter for paintings but with illustrations that he was able to sell, for example, to the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. He held his first exhibition in Dublin in 1899 and, like his London d&eacute;but, it was widely mentioned and in very positive terms; the writer and painter George Russell wrote in the <span class="italic">Dublin Express</span>: &#145;These sketches of the West of Ireland reveal a quite extraordinary ability in depicting character and movement&#146;  (Arnold, 85). His title for both shows referred to &#145;Life in the West of Ireland&#146;&#151;the title of his book of illustrations published in 1912.<h2>
<a name="MovetoIreland"></a>Move to Ireland</h2>In 1900 Yeats's mother died, worn out both physically and mentally by the difficult life imposed on her by her husband's ineffectual and self-indulgent behaviour. Yeats, who was greatly upset by her death, commissioned the plaque in St John's Church in Sligo, pointedly leaving out the name of his father from those listed as having placed it in the nave.<br>
<br>From the late 1890s until 1910, when Jack and Cottie moved to Ireland and settled in Greystones, in co. Wicklow, they regularly visited the country and spent time in the west. They stayed with Lady Gregory at Coole Park, revisited Sligo, explored Donegal, went to co. Kerry, and became marginally involved in the Irish literary revival in Dublin. With his close friend John Masefield, Yeats played games along the Gara river, constructing cardboard boats that Masefield furnished with equipment and even, at times, little engines. They bombarded and sank their own creations, Masefield writing vigorous lyrics about each vessel, Yeats producing drawings.<br>
<br>In 1905, through contact with the editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, Masefield obtained for Jack Yeats and John M. Synge a commission to report on the congested districts in Galway, Connemara, and Mayo. Synge wrote about their experiences, Yeats did the illustrations. The friendship flourished; they were like-minded men, contemplative, independent, reticent. Synge sought Yeats's help with certain costume aspects of his play <span class="italic">The Playboy of the Western World</span>, and Yeats was able to suggest the appearance and clothing of the hero, drawn from his experience of race meetings on Bowmore Strand, in Sligo, when he was a boy.<br>
<br>The two Yeats sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61425/', "Susan Mary (Lily) Yeats")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59839/', "Elizabeth Corbet (Lollie) Yeats")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61425/', "Yeats, Susan Mary")</script>], moved to Dublin, where they were later joined by their father. There they set up the Cuala Press and the Dun Emer Guild and became engaged in fine printing, embroidery work, and other cottage-industry activities. Somewhat reluctantly both William Butler Yeats and Jack Yeats were drawn into their sisters' ventures, and Jack produced broadsheets that were coloured by hand. In 1908 their father left Dublin for New York. As with most of the movements in his life it was meant to be a temporary shift of territory, but he never returned. His son Jack was not a great traveller but he did go to New York in 1904 (he had a liking for American stories of adventure). There he met Mark Twain, whom he greatly admired, and the lawyer John Quinn, who bought some of his early watercolours and drawings.<h2>
<a name="Crisisandresolution"></a>Crisis and resolution</h2>So far Yeats's career as a painter had taken a rather limited course. His abilities as a watercolourist were not matched when he turned to oil painting, for which he had studied inadequately, in part as a result of the Yeats family's financial needs while he was at art school. His deficiencies told in the early years of the twentieth century; until 1915 his canvases lack any convincing colour sense. When engaged in the representation of human figures, as he was with the series of oil paintings used as illustrations to <span class="italic">Irishmen All</span> (1913), by George Birmingham (the pseudonym of Canon James Owen Hannay), he achieved strength of design, a clear line, and good chiaroscuro. But he was still drawing in paint, and it worked less well when he produced landscapes; early examples, such as <span class="italic">The Police Sergeant</span> (reproduced Arnold, p. 179, fig. 157), are often unsubtle and rather flat.<br>
<br>In 1913 Yeats was chosen for the Armory show in New York, and sent to it one of his great early paintings, <span class="italic">The Circus Dwarf</span> (1912; priv. coll.; reproduced Arnold, p. 362, colour plate 5). He had already shown the work in London, in 1912, to some critical acclaim. In an article about Yeats in 1913 the art critic for <span class="italic">The Star</span>, A. J. Finberg, wrote: &#145;The people Mr Yeats is interested in are a rough, hard-bitten, unshaven, and generally disreputable lot of men. His broken-down actors practising fencing, his &#147;Circus Dwarf&#148; &hellip; are subjects no other artist would have chosen to paint&#146;. It is unlikely that other painters would have painted the political subjects that attracted Yeats but politics were very much part of Irish life, and he was increasingly identifying his work at this time with the events heralding the Easter Rising. Gun-running was one of these, a by-product of it his poignant study of pity, <span class="italic">Bachelor's Walk: in Memory</span> (also known as <span class="italic">In Memory</span>, 1915; priv. coll.; reproduced Arnold, p. 192, fig. 160), which shows a flower girl placing flowers on the spot in the street where a person was shot down by British soldiers who had unsuccessfully tried to prevent the Howth landing of arms. Later political works included <span class="italic">Communicating with Prisoners</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">The Funeral of Harry Boland</span> (1922; both Sligo Museum and Art Gallery).<br>
<br>Yeats's work in oils did not sell, and from a commercial point of view his and Cottie's decision to settle in Ireland had not been a success. In 1915 he had a nervous breakdown, which lasted into 1917. He had been made an associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1914 and a full academician in the following year. He was recognized for the originality of his vision and for his increasingly central role as a painter of Irish life at a time when nationalism demanded icon-makers, and his recovery was helped by this growing sense of a role in Dublin and in Irish society. He painted views of the city (<span class="italic">A Westerly Wind</span>, 1921; priv. coll.), its characters, its sporting events (<span class="italic">Singing the Dark Rosaleen, Croke Park, 1921</span>; priv. coll.). The country was going through the turmoil of the war of independence, the Anglo-Irish treaty, the civil war, and the grim political antagonisms that characterized the early 1920s. During this time Yeats produced a growing number of large and increasingly confident works. They show crowds attending sporting events at Croke Park; women singing in the street, in bars, or in trains; theatrical subjects; men of the streets, including newspaper-sellers and pavement artists. His early concept for exhibitions, &#145;Life in the west of Ireland&#146;, broadened into a succession of works that depicted the life of his country.<br>
<br>Yeats was fifty when Ireland became independent. Never directly involved in politics himself, he was nevertheless deeply affected by the civil war and, as a result of meeting Eamon de Valera in Paris at the Irish Race Congress in 1922, became and remained sympathetic to his political views and those of his followers. In this respect his thinking diverged from that of his brother, who had supported the treaty and become a member of the senate. At the congress Jack Yeats gave his only lecture, &#145;Modern aspects of Irish art&#146; (published in Dublin in 1922). This he managed to do without naming a single painter.<br>
<br>Yeats sided with modernism, which in Dublin in the early 1920s had a distinctive meaning. In the absence of a strong artistic tradition based on academic art the arrival in the city of modernist principles&#151;of abstraction, of a movement that related to European painting rather than to London&#151;was successful. Yeats sided with the artists, led by Paul Henry, who formed the Society of Dublin Painters and became one of their number. He met Oskar Kokoschka, and they became friends. He derided the dominance of Paris and London in artistic life generally; this had been a theme of his Paris lecture, and he expressed it in respect of Picasso, suggesting that he &#145;would be more thrilling to his time and generation if he had jumped straight out of Spain without the use of Paris&#146;  (MS letter to Thomas MacGreevy, 8 Dec 1925; TCD). MacGreevy, who was Yeats's great champion at the time as well as a modernist, writer, and poet, crossed swords with Thomas Bodkin, a more conventional art critic, over the direction that Yeats was taking and the magnitude of his contribution to modern art and thought in Dublin. This led to public controversy. Dublin in the early 1920s was described as &#145;the Athens of Pericles&#146;, and it was a truthful insight into the ferment of thought and debate about the cultural life of the new state. Yeats was happy to be part of this, and his exhibitions&#151;he showed work in New York, Rome, Pittsburgh, London, and Liverpool throughout the decade&#151;gave him the opportunity to represent more and more widely his chosen theme of Irish life.<h2>
<a name="Rejuvenation"></a>Rejuvenation</h2>During the 1920s Yeats became increasingly conscious of stylistic restrictions in his work. He was still having difficulties with colour and with the reconciliation of tone and compositional balance. He sought freedom, and it was not available to him in the more conventional techniques that he was employing. He dealt with the matter summarily. He abandoned his old palette and chose a new one, using primary colours quite freely; rich inflexions of colour were achieved with a freely handled impasto, substituting the palette knife and fingers for the brush. He chose to work on large canvases, and within them quite often to present a close focus on the subject matter; large horses' heads and strong-faced Irish men and women filled large picture areas. Characteristic was his use of ultramarine and cobalt blue in generous representation of shadow and of distant horizons. Cadmium yellow and alizarin crimson, used at times direct from the tube, produced works that caused former critics of the lameness of his earlier work to marvel at this extraordinary rejuvenation. (see, for example, <span class="italic">Glory</span>, 1946, and <span class="italic">Freedom</span>, 1947; both priv. coll.; reproduced in Arnold, pp. 369, 371, colour plates 12 and 14.)<br>
<br>But though Dublin marvelled at Yeats's work the resources to buy it were thinly spread in Irish society, particularly among those interested in modernism, and it did not sell at all well. Yeats's output, substantial during the 1920s, fell off in the following decade, and in a mood of self-doubt he turned to writing. He produced a number of volumes&#151;<span class="italic">Sligo</span> (1931), <span class="italic">The Charmed Life</span> (1938), <span class="italic">The Amaranthers</span> (1936), <span class="italic">The Careless Flower</span> (1947)&#151;and had high hopes of becoming a successful writer. He had similar aspirations for the plays that he wrote during the 1930s.<br>
<br>In 1941, through the intervention of John Betjeman, who suggested the idea to Kenneth Clark, Yeats was invited to show at the National Gallery, in London, with William Nicholson. The exhibition, opened on new year's day 1942, was a singular success and critical acclaim raised Yeats's stature greatly in Ireland. At the end of the Second World War he was given a retrospective exhibition in Dublin, and became in his last years a revered artistic figure. His output was vast. He painted more than 1100 works in oil, over half of them in the last twenty years of his long life. He died in Portobello Nursing Home, in Dublin, on 28 March 1957, Cottie having predeceased him, in 1948. The members of the government of the day, led by Eamon de Valera, and the main opposition parties turned out for his funeral and stood on the pavement as his coffin was brought from the church. He was buried on 30 March in Dublin's Mount Jerome cemetery.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>No Irish painter matched Jack B. Yeats at the end of his life, and his reputation continues to grow. In <span class="italic">The Painters of Ireland, 1660&#150;1920</span> (1978) Anne Crookshank and the knight of Glin pronounced him &#145;without doubt, the greatest Irish artist of the first half of the twentieth century&#146;  (p. 285). In singling out <span class="italic">In Memory</span> (1915), they include Michael Rosenthal's comment that this picture &#145;has become a symbol of the archetypal Irish woman mourning her lost men, both literally in wars and rebellions, and metaphorically through the piercing sadness of constant immigration&#146;  (ibid.). Yeats's artwork is now the focus of study by Irish cultural historians for its record of travellers, peasants, life in the west of Ireland, and larger themes of Irish cultural and national identity. Hilary Pyle's <i>catalogues raisonn&eacute;s</i> of his oil paintings (1992) and of his watercolours, drawings, and pastels (1993) followed her biography, <span class="italic">Jack B. Yeats</span> (1970; 2nd edn, 1989). His cartoons and illustrations have been the subject of separate studies. Yeats's work has been exhibited separately in, for example, &#145;Jack B. Yeats: the Late Paintings&#146; (Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol, and Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 1991), &#145;Jack B. Yeats: a Celtic Visionary&#146; (Manchester City Art Gallery, 1996), and jointly with other artists in &#145;Aspects of Irish Art&#146; (Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts, Ohio, and elsewhere, 1974). <span class="italic">The Selected Writings of Jack B. Yeats</span>, edited by Robin Skelton, appeared in 1991. Some years after Yeats's death Thomas Kinsella celebrated his life and that of Eamon de Valera, two very different early twentieth-century Irish public figures, in his poem &#145;The Last&#146;. Yet Yeats, like the figure in his painting <span class="italic">The Folded Heart</span>, remains an intensely private man.<br>
