<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Selwyn,  George Augustus</span>  (1719&#150;1791), <span class="occ">wit and politician</span>, was born on 11 August 1719 and baptized at Chislehurst, Kent, on 25 August, the second son of the three children of John Selwyn (1688&#150;1751) of Matson, near Gloucester, and Mary (1690/91&#150;1777), daughter of General Thomas Farrington of Chislehurst. Selwyn's father was the son of William Selwyn, governor of Jamaica (1703&#150;4), and served as the aide-de-camp to the duke of Marlborough, MP for Gloucester between 1734 and 1751 and as treasurer of Queen Caroline's pensions before his death on 6 November 1751. His mother, who also served the queen as a woman of the bedchamber, was described by Lord Hervey as &#145;a simple cunning woman &hellip; the only &hellip; about the Court who loved Sir Robert Walpole&#146;  (J. Hervey, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. R. S. Sedgwick, 1952, 196). It was at her house at Cleveland Court, St James's, Westminster, that Walpole and his secretary of state, Viscount Townshend, had earlier come to blows in a contest satirized in act II, scene X of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. Mary Selwyn died on 6 November 1777 aged eighty-six.<br>
<br>In 1732 Selwyn entered Eton College, where his contemporaries included several lifelong friends, the politician Richard, second Baron Edgcumbe, the poet Thomas Gray, and the memoirist Horace Walpole. He matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford, on 1 December 1739 but left the university to undertake a European tour during 1742&#150;3 before returning to Oxford in late 1744 or early 1745. An offensive gesture in a tavern, which observers interpreted as mocking the holy communion, prompted the end of his university career soon after. By then, however, Selwyn's financial security was assured. Five years earlier he had received the first of several lucrative sinecures, the office of clerk of the irons and surveyor of the meltings of the mint, worth, together with his father's allowance, &pound;220 per annum. The early death of his elder brother John, MP for Whitchurch, in June 1751 followed by that of his father in November led to Selwyn's inheritance of the family estate at Matson and a parliamentary interest which allowed him to nominate both members for Ludgershall, Wiltshire. From 1747 he himself occupied one of these seats until he took over as MP for Gloucester at the general election of 1754. For the next twenty-four years he offered, at a price, the Ludgershall seats to each incoming administration until his defeat at Gloucester in 1780 led to a return to his former constituency. Further income was obtained from the acquisition of three additional lifelong sinecures&#151;the posts of registrar of court of chancery in Barbados (from 1753), paymaster of the board of works (from 1755 until its abolition in 1782), and two years later the surveyor-generalship of crown lands.<br>
<br>Selwyn's parliamentary performance proved remarkable only for its non-existence. During his forty-four years in the house he did not speak on a single occasion. At best a detached observer of parliamentary affairs, he was otherwise a sleeping partner, prone to slumber while in the chamber. As a result, his sporadic displays of political energy were used by more active members as an indication of the severity or urgency of a particular issue, notably the fate of Barbados during the American War of Independence. But as this example shows, self-interest was never far behind any cause for which Selwyn roused himself. His political companions included a number of individuals, among them James Hare, Charles James Fox, and the fifth earl of Carlisle, who also made up a social circle in which he proved far more lively. Selwyn himself declared that his only political master was the king, at whose disposal he claimed to lay his parliamentary interest, and whose lead he followed when, voting against Fox's <span class="roman">East India Bill</span> in November 1783, he offered his one and only act of defiance against the ministry of the day.<br>
<br>Selwyn came to life in London club society, in which he was a noted conversationalist, a dedicated gambler, and a celebrated humorist. Commenting during the last decade of Selwyn's life the memoirist Nathaniel Wraxall spoke of him possessing &#145;an infinite wit. He had indeed succeeded to Philip, earl of Chesterfield's reputation for <i>bon-mots</i>&#146;. The key to Selwyn's success appears to have been the droll manner of his delivery. Horace Walpole remarked on the effective contrast between his &#145;demure&#146; demeanour and biting witticisms  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.170). For Wraxall the impact of his comments was &#145;greatly augmented by the listless and drowsy manner in which he uttered them, for he always seemed half asleep&#146;  (H. B. Wheatley, ed., <span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs of his Own Time by Sir Nathaniel William Wraxhall</span>, 5 vols., 1884, 2.289). Certainly, lists of his most celebrated comments  (see Jesse, 1.16&#150;22), the majority of which have not stood the test of time, suggest that Selwyn's wit owed more to its performance than to its content. Rival wags rewarded his efforts with one further specious sinecure: receiver-general of waif and stray jokes.<br>
<br>Less light-hearted was Selwyn's interest in executions, at which he was a regular attender. In 1757, for example, he went to Paris to watch the dismemberment of the would-be royal assassin Damiens. His fascination with the moment of death and the resultant corpse was widely commented on within his circle. &#145;The next time Mr Selwyn calls shew him up&#146;, commented Henry, first Baron Holland, on his deathbed: &#145;if I am alive I shall be delighted to see him, and if I am dead he will be delighted to see me&#146;  (Jesse, 1.5). After his own death, Selwyn's peculiar pastime was vigorously debated by his friends in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>; the biographer Philip Thicknesse, for instance, downplayed Selwyn's association with the macabre, which he attributed to gossip by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams and Lord Chesterfield  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 299, 705).<br>
<br>In later life Selwyn suffered from gout and dropsy, and he died from a &#145;violent urinary complaint&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 61.94&#150;5) on 25 January 1791 at his Westminster home in Cleveland Court, St James's. Though unmarried, he was the adopted father of Maria Emily Fagnani, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42344/', "Maria Emily Seymour-Conway, marchioness of Hertford (1770/71&#150;1856)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25167/', "Conway, Francis Ingram-Seymour-, second marquess of Hertford")</script>], the daughter of the Marchesa Fagnani. Rumours circulated as to whether Selwyn was the child's natural father, though it is now widely accepted that the father was one of Selwyn's closest friends, the rakish William Douglas, fourth duke of Queensberry. Certainly contemporaries like Lady Louisa Stuart were sceptical as to Selwyn's ability to enter a relationship: &#145;George Selwyn in love, George Selwyn gallant, were thoughts that never entered any one's head&#146;  (Cannon, 3.421). As well as to Maria (known as Mie-Mie), who later married Francis, marquess of Hertford, Selwyn developed a fierce attachment to several other children, including offspring of the earls of Coventry and Carlisle. In his will he left &pound;30,000 and a house in Piccadilly to his adopted daughter; other bequests of 100 guineas each went to his nephews, Charles Townshend and Ebrow Woodcock. Following his death Selwyn was praised and defended by friends like Walpole&#151;who wrote of the &#145;goodness of his heart and nature&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;while the Revd Dr John Warner complimented a &#145;Social wit which, never kindling strife, Blazed in the small sweet courtesies of life&#146;. On reflection, however, theirs are views with which it is difficult to agree. Narcissistic, self-serving, indolent, and prone to once barbed and now flat commentaries, Selwyn was a man of his day whose reputation has, deservedly, dated and withered over time.<br>
