<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ollivant,  Alfred</span>  (1798&#150;1882), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was born on 16 August 1798 in Manchester, the younger son of William Ollivant and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Stephen Langston of Great Horwood, Buckinghamshire. The family moved to London when the father became a clerk in the Navy Office and lived at 11 Smith Street, Northampton Square. Educated at St Paul's School (1809&#150;16), he was admitted as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge, on 11 June 1816 and matriculated at Easter 1817. He was the Craven scholar in 1820, graduated sixth wrangler in 1821, and gained the chancellor's medal for classics. He won the Tyrwhitt Hebrew scholarship in 1822 and was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College.<br>
<br>In 1827 Ollivant was appointed vice-principal of the newly founded St David's College, Lampeter. While in Cardiganshire he found time to learn Welsh and he preached regularly in that language at Llangeler, of which he was vicar as well as sinecure rector. He returned to Cambridge in 1843 as regius professor of divinity. In 1849 he was nominated to the see of Llandaff, his knowledge of Wales and of the Welsh language being the chief reasons for his elevation. In 1831 he married Alicia Olivia Spencer (1801&#150;1886) of Bramley Grange, Yorkshire. Three sons survived them, one of whom, Joseph Earle, was chancellor of the dioceses of Llandaff and St David's.<br>
<br>The diocese of Llandaff had long been impoverished and neglected, served by a long line of absentee bishops. The cathedral was a so-called Italian temple, a partial restoration dating from 1736, set in the medieval ruin. In 1849 the ecclesiastical commissioners augmented the bishop's stipend by &pound;3150 to bring it up to the minimum level of &pound;4500 and bought an official residence in Llandaff. Ollivant was therefore able to live in the diocese and attend to its pressing needs. Industrialization had changed the face of the south Wales valleys, and the church in the erstwhile rural diocese had been overtaken by the rapid growth of nonconformity. The Church Extension Society, which he founded in 1850, undertook a massive programme of church and school building; over 170 churches were built or restored. Ollivant also saw the complete restoration of the cathedral, under the direction of a local architect, John Prichard. He was much concerned about the education of the clergy and the needs of the Welsh-speaking areas of the diocese.<br>
<br>As a young man at Cambridge, Ollivant had been influenced by the famous evangelical Charles Simeon, and he was to retain that influence throughout his life. As a theologian, the former professor was cautious and conservative, fearful of the development of biblical criticism. His <span class="italic">Charge</span> of 1857 was devoted to a detailed, if now unconvincing, refutation of the works of Rowland Williams, then vice-principal at Lampeter and an advocate of the still tentative views of the German critics. Ollivant was equally suspicious of the activities of the Anglo-Catholic clergy who began to appear in the diocese after 1870. He inhibited Arthur Stanton, the long-serving curate of St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, from officiating anywhere in the diocese, even though Stanton was a frequent visitor to the home of the powerful Talbot family at Margam. He rebuked the vicar of St Mary's, Cardiff, for wearing a surplice with a large cross on it. It turned out to be a white chasuble borrowed from the parish of Margam.<br>
<br>In person tall and spare with features said by some to resemble the duke of Wellington, but more refined, Ollivant became increasingly deaf. This hindered him in his work for the panel producing the Revised Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1870. He finally died on 16 December 1882 at Bishop's Court, Llandaff. He was buried on 21 December in the cathedral grounds, his grave marked by a large Celtic cross in a local red stone. A monument with his effigy was placed in the chancel, near the high altar, as befits one who was the second founder of the cathedral. Apart from a chip off the nose it escaped damage when the cathedral was bombed in 1941.<br>
<br>Besides a large number of minor publications, his triennial charges from 1851 onwards are still useful sources for the conditions in the diocese, as is his <span class="italic">Some Account of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral</span> (1857, 1860) for the state of that building. His library, donated to the cathedral, is now housed at St Michael's College, Llandaff, the books amply annotated by his handwritten comments in the margins.<br>
