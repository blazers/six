<span class="headword">Mansfield <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Manfield]</span>, Sir  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1734, <em>d.</em> 1821), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized at Ringwood, Hampshire, on 30 May 1734, the son of John James Manfield, attorney, of Ringwood, and his wife, Elizabeth. His grandfather was reputedly of foreign descent and was at one time employed in Windsor Castle. Little is known of his personal life, and while most sources state that he never married it is known that he fathered at least five children. Among them was John Edward Mansfield, father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17996/', "William Rose Mansfield")</script>. He attended Eton College between 1745 and 1750, when he entered King's College, Cambridge, as a scholar. At university he changed his surname from Manfield to Mansfield, and in 1754 was elected a fellow of King's. He graduated BA in 1755 and proceeded MA in 1758.<br>
<br>Like his father Mansfield pursued a career in law. On 11 February 1755 he was admitted at the Middle Temple and on 28 November 1758 he was called to the bar. As a lawyer he acquired prestige and success, and practised at common law as well as in chancery. When John Wilkes returned to England in 1768 Mansfield was appointed one of his counsel and argued in the court of king's bench, albeit unsuccessfully, in favour of Wilkes's application for bail on the grounds that he had been outlawed improperly. He was appointed king's counsel on 24 July 1772 and a bencher of the Middle Temple on 6 November 1772. He was involved in numerous trials, including that of Elizabeth Chudleigh, duchess of Kingston, for bigamy, in 1776, and in the same year that of the four candidates who had stood for parliament at Hindon in 1774, for bribery. He was also defence counsel, in 1777, for James Aitken (John the Painter), the pro-American arsonist who torched naval stores at Portsmouth and warehouses at the port of Bristol, and appeared as crown prosecutor in 1779 against George Stratton and others who took over the administration of Fort St George (Madras) without authorization in 1776.<br>
<br>Mansfield's ability drew interest from political patrons. In 1776 the earl of Carlisle offered to bring him into the Commons for Morpeth but Mansfield declined, as he was hoping for judicial office, which would preclude his sitting in the Commons. In 1778 Lord North, considering the appointment of a new attorney-general and solicitor-general, suggested Mansfield and James Wallace to George III as &#145;the gentlemen who stand foremost, are sensible men and good lawyers&#146;  (Christie), though he doubted the potential of both as parliamentarians. Mansfield was not appointed on this occasion. He eventually stood for the Commons at Cambridge University in 1779, supported by the chancellor (the former prime minister Grafton) against the government candidate, but after his election he voted with North's administration. On 1 September 1780, following Wallace's promotion to attorney-general, he was appointed solicitor-general. In this role he took part in the government's prosecution of Lord George Gordon for high treason in 1781.<br>
<br>Mansfield left office in April 1782, following the resignation of North, and opposed the Rockingham and Shelburne administrations. William Eden observed in September 1782 that he was &#145;very earnest for the demolition of Lord Shelburne's Government at any rate, and yet he has not fallen in love with Fox&#146;  (Christie). In November 1783 he was returned briefly to office in the coalition between North and Charles James Fox, but the ministry was dismissed in December of that year and Mansfield was again forced into opposition. His parliamentary career ended in April 1784, when he was defeated at the general election, and while his oratory achievements in parliament are not distinguished, the <span class="italic">English Chronicle</span> in 1781 described him as &#145;a man of keen but not elegant parts&#151;he speaks with point, labour and precision, but without any of those graces which give energy to talents and make eloquence pleasing, as well as instructing&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Mansfield returned to his legal career. In 1782 he had been elected reader at the Middle Temple and in 1785 he was elected treasurer. In 1795 he and John Scott, subsequently lord chancellor and earl of Eldon, represented the fellows of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in Francis Wrangham's appeal against the fellows' decision not to elect Wrangham to a fellowship. The argument turned upon the proper construction of the words &#145;idoneus moribus et ingenio&#146; in the college statutes, and Wrangham's counsel cited Terence, Horace, and other Latin authors to prove that &#145;mores&#146;, as applied to an individual, could only mean morals. Mansfield successfully argued that &#145;mores&#146; referred to manners and character, quoting a line from Ovid describing two mistresses&#151;&#145;H&aelig;c specie melior, moribus illa fuit&#146;&#151;and Wrangham lost his appeal. He was also counsel for the plaintiffs, with Samuel Romilly, in the case of <i>Thellusson v. Woodford</i>, in 1797, which established that there was no distinction in law between trusts designed to prevent the alienation of property by creating a series of limited interests preventing the vesting of property in an absolute owner in the future, and a trust for accumulation designed to restrict the uses of inherited property by heirs.<br>
<br>Mansfield was appointed chief justice of Chester in July 1799 and chief justice of the common pleas on 24 April 1804, when he was knighted. He also became a serjeant-at-law, taking the motto &#145;serus in c&#339;lum redeas&#146;, alluding to his exclusion from office. As a judge he was known for &#145;an ungraceful delivery and a husky voice&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and for his unsteady temper, which was easily exploited in court for the amusement of counsel, rather than for the high quality of his judgments. However, a merchant, Joseph Minet, told Joseph Farington that Mansfield &#145;preserved High Authority in the Court of Common Pleas by his superior knowledge of Law, which was such that in Chancery Lord Eldon was afraid of Him, &amp; was glad to have him appointed to the Chief Justiceship&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 6.2428). He enjoyed shooting, and on circuit liked to rise at five &#145;to kill something before breakfast&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In 1806 he was the Grenville ministry's next choice after Edward Law, first Baron Ellenborough, for the lord chancellorship, but like Ellenborough he refused. He opposed the bill in 1807 that prevented the crown granting reversions to office. As chief justice he upheld the earlier rulings by William Murray, earl of Mansfield, that a moral obligation should count as a valuable consideration in contract law, in the cases <i>Barnes v. Hedley</i> (1809) and <i>Lee v. Muggeridge</i> (1813). On 15 May 1812 he presided over the trial of John Bellingham for the murder of Spencer Perceval. There he instructed the jury that Bellingham's belief that Perceval was the cause of his mistreatment by the authorities was a &#145;&#147;fancy&#148; and his consequent behaviour &#147;an opportunity to gratify revenge&#148;&#146;  (Eigen, 54); unlike the insane, Mansfield argued, Bellingham was able to act rationally and could distinguish right from wrong.<br>
<br>Mansfield resigned on 21 February 1814, on account of ill health. It is clear that he had been a better legal practitioner than a parliamentarian but Sir Nathaniel Wraxall described him as a man &#145;of acknowledged talents, parliamentary no less than professional&#146; and as one who &#145;manifested great energies of mind and character&#146;  (Christie). He died on 23 May 1821 at his house in Russell Square, London, having instructed, through his will, that all his personal papers be burnt following his death.<br>
