<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kingsley,  Mary Henrietta</span>  (1862&#150;1900), <span class="occ">traveller and writer</span>, born in Islington, London, on 13 October 1862, was the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15618/', "George Henry Kingsley (1826&#150;1892)")</script>, a physician and traveller, and his wife and former housekeeper, Mary Bailey (<i>d</i>. 1892). The novelists Charles Kingsley and Henry Kingsley were her uncles. Her parents married only four days before her birth, but she managed to keep this a secret throughout her life, and indeed it remained undisclosed until long after her death.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeathome"></a>Early life at home</h2>In 1863, soon after Mary Kingsley's birth, her parents moved to Highgate, where her only sibling, Charles, was born in 1866. Her father, an enthusiastic traveller, attached himself as private physician to titled families on their world tours, using the opportunity to collect ethnographical information; he was rarely at home. The remaining family led a private, even secluded life, and Mary grew up a rather silent girl, shirking social gatherings. Describing herself as a &#145;doer of odd jobs&#146;  (letter to Matthew Nathan, 12 March 1899, Nathan MSS), as a young woman she supported her mother in household duties and assisted in her father's amateur anthropological work, for which she learned German. She was not sent to school, but read omnivorously, and created a world of her own among the travel, natural history, and science books in her father's library.<br>
<br>In 1879 the family moved to Bexleyheath in Kent, and in the spring of 1886 to Cambridge, where Mary's brother had entered Christ's College to study law. This change had a great effect on her; she made friends among the academic community, including Francis Burkitt and Agnes Smith Lewis, and began to develop her own academic and social skills. About the spring of 1888, Lucy Toulmin Smith, an old family friend, gave her her first taste of foreign travel when she took her to Paris for a week.<br>
<br>During the four years that followed, Mary Kingsley devoted herself to nursing her mother, whose health deteriorated to such an extent that she lost the power of speech and was, eventually, paralysed. During the latter part of this period she also had care of her father, who had returned home broken in health after rheumatic fever. Dr Kingsley died in February 1892, and his wife in April. The heavy sense of responsibility which had weighed on Mary was lightened, and after a trip to the Canary Islands in August she returned restored in health and refreshed in mind, full of new possibilities awakened by all she had seen, especially the people and goods from the African continent about which she had so avidly read.<br>
<br>Mary Kingsley moved with her brother to an attic flat in Addison Road, Kensington. Filled with a passion for travel and bolstered by a desire to further her anthropological studies, she thought first of going to India, but decided eventually on a voyage to west Africa. She acquired a collector's outfit and posted letters of introduction to missionaries, traders, and government officials on the west African coast. With a new-found sense of freedom, she drew up her will and set out alone in August 1893.<h2>
<a name="MaryKingsleyinAfrica"></a>Mary Kingsley in Africa</h2>Mary Kingsley first touched African soil in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 17 August, then headed slowly south to Luanda. After making her way north again, in October she visited Richard Dennett's trading station at Cabinda. Information gathered on this two-week visit was later utilized in an introduction to Dennett's <span class="italic">Notes on the Folk Lore of the Fjort&#151;French Congo</span> (1898). She also collected or purchased scientific specimens along her route. She reached Liverpool again in December 1893.<br>
<br>The collections which Mary Kingsley brought home were considered valuable by the scientific community, and the voyage had been a foretaste of what she might do with more definite aims and better preparation. Determined to undertake a more rigorous research project in west Africa, she contacted Dr Albert G&uuml;nther, keeper of zoology at the British Museum, who gave her a large range of collectors' materials. By the end of the year she had secured a commission from the publisher George Macmillan for a book on west Africa. With increased expertise, resources, and confidence, she sailed from Liverpool on 23 December 1894 in the company of Lady Ethel Macdonald, the wife of the commissioner-general of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, whom she had met in Calabar in 1893.<br>
<br>Mary Kingsley stayed four months with the Macdonalds at the Calabar residency, nursing the European residents through a smallpox outbreak and, despite the Brass uprising, making brief trips inland, and accompanied the Macdonalds on an official visit to the Spanish governor on Fernando Po. In April she travelled upriver to Ekene to visit the maverick Scottish missionary Mary Slessor, with whom she formed a strong bond of friendship.<br>
<br>At the beginning of May, Mary Kingsley began her journey south to Gabon, before ascending the Ogoou&eacute; River and passing through the dangerous rapids above N'Djol&eacute;. A short though daring journey through a part of the Fang country which had never been reached by a European before, leading her own two-canoe expedition from Lambarene on the Ogoou&eacute; River to Agonjo on the upper waters of the Rambo&euml; River, established her reputation as an explorer. In August she visited Corisco Island. The last feat of this second African journey was the ascent of Mount Cameroun (13,760 ft) by a route previously unattempted by a European.<br>
<br>In order to pay her way and make contact with African peoples, Mary Kingsley learned to trade in rubber, ivory, tobacco, and other common trading goods. She brought home a collection of insects, shells, and plants; eighteen species of reptiles; and sixty-five species of fish, of which three were entirely new and were named after her. Careful notes and observations on the spot, combined with the writings of earlier travellers, were afterwards used as the foundation for her lectures, articles, and books.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEngland"></a>Return to England</h2>Mary Kingsley landed in England on 30 November 1895. There was immediate press interest in her &#145;surprising and courageous adventures&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 3 Dec 1895, 3). Angered by the inevitable focus on her achievements as a lone woman, her first venture into print was a letter to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, countering a report that she was a &#145;New Woman&#146;. News of her travels was quickly followed by a flood of invitations to write articles and give talks. In February her first lecture, delivered before the Scottish Geographical Society, was read out by a male fellow while she was present on the platform; the following month her paper to the Liverpool Geographical Society was read by the trader James Irvine. Although the Liverpool talk was similar in content to that delivered in Scotland, she added an outline of her proposals for a system of informal economic imperialism in Africa, knowing that her audience would contain members of Liverpool's commercial community.<br>
<br>In January 1897 Mary Kingsley's first book, <span class="italic">Travels in West Africa, Congo Fran&ccedil;ais, Corisco and Cameroons</span>, was published, reflecting her own eclectic interests, as a collection of &#145;facts, good healthy facts &hellip; all hopelessly adrift and mixed up pretty nearly as much as the cargo in a palm oil trader&#151;missionary intelligence entangled in the Lippoums Genera of beetles&#151;trade statistics with the habits of fish&#146;  (letter to George Macmillan, 18 Dec 1894, Macmillan MSS). Nevertheless, the publicity surrounding publication put her in contact with yet more influential people, including the Liverpool businessman John Holt, the Indian expert Sir Alfred Lyall, and the anthropologist James Frazer. By June 1897 she had engaged a lecture agent, Gerald Christy.<br>
<br>Mary Kingsley's article in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> of 19 March 1898 on the imposition of a &#145;hut-tax&#146; in Sierra Leone drew her into another political controversy, and led to her being approached by the colonial secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, who clandestinely courted her advice. With huge work demands and an unfulfilled longing to return to the African continent, that same year she suffered a breakdown.<h2>
<a name="MaryKingsleysvisionforAfrica"></a>Mary Kingsley's vision for Africa</h2>During the next two years Mary Kingsley lectured on west Africa throughout the country, speaking to divergent audiences, including nurses, working men, scientists, scholars, and both the Liverpool and Manchester chambers of commerce, where she was the first woman to address the members. Her great desire was that the general public should know the conditions of life and government in the west African colonies. She drew attention to the injustices of the crown colony system of British rule and spoke out in favour of British trading interests in the area, defending the &#145;liquor traffic&#146; which had been condemned by the missionary societies.<br>
<br>In private, Mary Kingsley claimed that her understanding of and sympathy for African societies arose from an ability to &#145;think in black&#146;  (&#145;West Africa&#146;, 59), owing particularly to the fact that she was a woman. From this position she defended polygamy and even the slave trade. The missionary societies' attempts to Europeanize Africans, she said, was misguided and harmful, immersing Africans in a &#145;second hand rubbishy white culture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Travels in West Africa</span>, 20). In her own writing, she focused on the Fang, Africans who were still &#145;in the raw state&#146;  (letter to E. S. Hartland, 5 Jan 1897, Hartland MSS).<br>
<br>With such controversial views, and wary of claims that her lone travels and public work were inappropriate activities for a woman, Mary Kingsley always took pains to dress conservatively, usually in black, and to tie back her long hay-coloured hair in a tight bun secured with plenty of pins, giving the impression of a far older woman. She was not conventionally attractive; Lucy Toulmin Smith wrote that &#145;her fine square brow was her chief beauty&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). But this hard appearance was softened by a keen sense of humour, displayed in both her talks and her writing.<br>
<br>Although publicly denying any political ambitions, in private Mary Kingsley rigorously networked behind the scenes, firing off letters to those in positions of influence, including John Strachey, editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and Sir George Goldie of the Royal Niger Company, cultivating their friendship with what she called &#145;feminine artfulness&#146;  (letter to John Holt, 1 Jan 1898, Holt MSS).<br>
<br>In February 1899 <span class="italic">West African Studies</span> appeared. Mary Kingsley's second book was far more ambitious than her first, outlining an &#145;alternative plan&#146; for west Africa. This would put administrative control in the hands of European trading interests and incorporate African opinion. An arrangement of economic ties under British merchants rather than administrative control through &#145;pen-pushers and ostrich feathers&#146; was her aim. Only such a system, she claimed, would leave African cultural, legal, and social organizations intact.<br>
<br>In February 1899, at a dinner party, Mary Kingsley was introduced to Matthew Nathan, the recently appointed acting governor of Sierra Leone, for whom she developed an unrequited attachment. Her relationships with other professional women were often competitive and confrontational; in particular she clashed with Flora Shaw, colonial editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, who refused to review her books. In August 1899 she withheld her support from a petition requesting women's admission to the learned societies. &#145;These androgynes [<i>sic</i>] I have no time for&#146;, she complained  (letter to John Scott Keltie, 1 Dec 1899, Royal Geographical Society correspondence, 1881&#150;1910).<h2>
<a name="DeathinAfrica"></a>Death in Africa</h2>Mary Kingsley's health continued to suffer under the strain of being a &#145;bushman <i>and</i> a drawing-roomer&#146;  (letter to Hatty Johnson, 27 Jan 1898, South African Library), and she longed to get away. The South African War of 1899 turned her thoughts to South Africa, from where she hoped to return to her own west coast. She sailed on 11 March 1900. On her arrival at Cape Town she offered her services as a nurse and was posted to the Simon's Town Palace Hospital to tend to Boer prisoners of war. Within two months the typhoid that was killing her patients struck her, and on 3 June 1900 she died. According to her own wishes, she was buried at sea. The coffin was conveyed from Simon's Town harbour on a torpedo boat with full military honours.<br>
<br>Commentators on Mary Kingsley's life and work have often accredited her with laying the political foundation for the introduction of indirect rule in Northern Nigeria. But it is in the informal sector of political life that she left her legacy. Her appeal for an understanding of African social and legal systems and the importance of commercial interests forged a new pressure group in colonial politics called the Fair Commerce Party, Third Party, or simply &#145;Kingsleyism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 27 Dec 1902). The journalist E. D. Morel, the businessman John Holt, and the historian Alice Stopford Green were central in this movement, and the Congo Reform Association and African Society, founded in Mary Kingsley's memory, were the new forums through which they operated.<br>
<br>Mary Kingsley's lone travels, her sympathy for African societies, and her unorthodox views suggest a woman with radical opinions on both race and gender. In this spirit her work has been republished (<span class="italic">Travels in West Africa</span>, Virago, 1982), and biographies have portrayed her as a pioneer (Katherine Frank, <span class="italic">A Voyager Out</span>, 1987). The Mary Kingsley medal of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine was founded in her honour. But her social conservatism, and in particular her declarations against the widening of women's rights, dog attempts to reclaim her as a proto-feminist. At the same time the seriousness of her political programme and the tragedy of her death make it impossible for her to be recast successfully as one of the wearisomely sprightly lady travellers discovered in the 1980s and 1990s. Enigmatic and impossible to stereotype, Mary Kingsley established in her lifetime and has retained after her death the reputation as one of the most celebrated of all women travellers and travel writers. Her courage, skill, and adaptability in little-known and difficult terrain were remarkable; her insight into African culture was penetrating, especially in one whose direct contact with the continent stretched over only two years; the skill with which she advanced her ideas in Britain was formidable; her literary talent, despite her self-deprecating description, was conspicuous; and the scope of her intellect was wide. But, unlike other women travellers, even Isabella Bishop, Mary Kingsley's engagement with and her often prescient if idiosyncratic views on social and political questions have ensured that her reputation extends well beyond the confines of travel and travel writing.<br>
