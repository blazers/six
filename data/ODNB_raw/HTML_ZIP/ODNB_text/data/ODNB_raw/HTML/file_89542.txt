<span class="headword">Pigott,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1661, <em>d.</em> 1737), <span class="occ">barrister and counsellor at law</span>, was baptized on 17 July 1661 at St Bride's, London, the elder son of Adam Pigott (<i>d</i>. 1737?), merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth (probably <i>n&eacute;e</i> Griffin). His brother, Adam (1673&#150;1751), was a Jesuit private chaplain in York. A Roman Catholic, he was probably educated abroad, at Douai or St Omer. He was admitted to the Inner Temple on 19 March 1683 and called to the bar, in the same year as such other Catholic lawyers as Edward Bedingfeld, on 4 July 1688. On 24 November 1689 he refused to take the required oaths of supremacy and allegiance and to receive the sacrament. Consequently his call was &#145;vacated&#146; on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic: Pigott was the last Catholic called to the bar until 1791. In 1690 his suspension was removed without any reason being given, although he was still proscribed from pleading a case in court. About this time he married Rebecca Busby, with whom he had seven sons and three daughters, three sons becoming priests and a daughter becoming a nun. His London home was in Holborn Row, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and he had property at Bodingham in Essex. He bought his main residence in Whitton, Middlesex, from Sir John Webb in 1715, adhering to the requirement that Catholics should not reside permanently in London. The house faced Whitton House, the residence of Sir Godfrey Kneller.<br>
<br>Pigott practised as a chamber counsel and conveyancer, acting as trustee for conveyances, furnishing legal opinions, and offering legal and business advice. &#145;In the conveyancing branch of the law his eminence was undisputed&#146;  (Kirk, 184). He had extensive libraries in the studies of both his houses, containing books in canon, common, and civil law, some inherited from colleagues, as well as an extensive collection of manuscripts. Conveyancing expertise was particularly important to the preservation of Roman Catholic estates, which were vulnerable to claims from potential protestant heirs and from threatened sequestrations by the crown. His clerk was Charles Boucher, subsequently one of his executors.<br>
<br>Following the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1715 Pigott defended James Radcliffe, third earl of Derwentwater, William Gordon, sixth Viscount Kenmure, and other leaders of the rebellion, alongside Derwentwater's lawyer, Henry Eyre (<i>c</i>.1667&#150;1719). Having in 1706 advocated giving &#145;assurance both in conscience and law for our obedience to the government&#146; in return for protection  (Pigott to Sir Robert Throckmorton, 9 May 1706, Warwickshire RO, Throckmorton papers, CR 1998, box 65), Pigott joined Eyre in persuading Derwentwater and Kenmure to follow what both lawyers saw as the only practical course, of pleading guilty to high treason. Kenmure later lamented that their lawyers had not mounted a more spirited defence. Pigott himself was fined &pound;50 in 1715 for refusing to take the oath of allegiance.<br>
<br>Pigott acted for Alexander Pope during the long dispute between Pope and the widow of Sir Godfrey Kneller over the siting of the memorial to Kneller in Twickenham church, a dispute resolved in 1725. Pigott nursed Pope back to health following Pope's coach crash into the River Crane outside Whitton House in September 1726. Pope acknowledged both services a year later:<blockquote>
<div>The Muse this one Verse to learn'd Pigot addresses,<br>
</div>
<div>In whose Heart, like his Writings, was never found flaw;<br>
</div>
<div>Whom Pope prov'd his Friend in his two chief distresses,<br>
</div>
<div>Once in danger of Death, once in danger of Law.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The poems of Alexander Pope</span>, 476)</blockquote>Pigott's clients included many in the tight circle of prominent Catholic families, including among many others William Fairfax, eighth Viscount Fairfax, of Gilling in Yorkshire (whose daughter Alethea married Pigott's second son, Ralph), the Petres of Ingatestone in Essex, the Arundells of Lanherne in Cornwall, and the Throckmortons of Coughton, Warwickshire, as well as Edward Caryll of Harting, Sussex, who married Pigott's eldest daughter, Katherine. Pigott also had several prominent protestant clients, including James Brydges, duke of Chandos, the earl of Derby, the Websters of Copthall in Essex, the Dashwoods of West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, all of whom were Anglicans, and the Darby family of Coalbrookdale, Shropshire, who were Quakers. He was also councillor (<i>consiliarius</i>) and advocate to the English Benedictine congregation for over thirty years from about 1687.<br>
<br>After a short illness, in which he was nursed by his sister-in-law Hannah Busby, he died at his home in Whitton, Middlesex, on 5 July 1737, and was buried in St Mary's Church, Twickenham; his memorial tablet by Peter Scheemakers has his old friend Alexander Pope's tribute to one who &#145;gave more honour to his profession, than he derived from it. Possessed of the highest character, by his learning, judgment, experience, integrity, depriv'd of the highest stations, only by his conscience and religion&#146;. His wife, who had lost her memory, survived him.<br>
<br>In his will Pigott left his &#145;four old Common Place Books&#146;, his most vital working resource, to his neighbour John Ward of the Temple. From his three manuscripts of &#145;analasise of the common and civil law&#146; two legal works were published posthumously in 1739, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Common Recoveries, their Nature and Use</span> and <span class="italic">New Precedents in Conveyancing</span>, a composite of precedents from various lawyers in which Pigott himself is the most prominent source. Pigott's texts remained standard authorities for the remainder of the eighteenth century. Of his family, his son Edward administered the last rites to Alexander Pope in 1744, and Ralph was the father of the astronomer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22254/', "Nathaniel Pigott")</script>.<br>
