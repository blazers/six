<span class="headword">Dennis,  Richard William George</span>  (1910&#150;2003), <span class="occ">mycologist</span>, was born on 13 July 1910 at 9 Gloucester Road, Thornbury, Gloucestershire, the only son of Samuel William Gallop Dennis, headmaster of the local Church of England school, and his wife, Mabel Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nash. He was educated at Thornbury elementary school and then Thornbury grammar school. From 1927 he studied at the University of Bristol, and obtained a first-class honours degree in botany in 1930. His thesis, on black canker of willows caused by <i>Physalospora miyabeana</i>, was the subject of his first paper, published in <span class="italic">Transactions of the British Mycological Society</span> in 1931, and the start of the early part of his career devoted to plant pathology. He never abandoned the subject, but later turned to fungal systematics, on which he became one of the world's leading experts.<br>
<br>Rejected by the colonial service, Dennis was appointed in 1930 to the plant husbandry department at the West of Scotland Agricultural College, Glasgow. He studied boron and manganese deficiency in oats and swedes as well as <i>Helminthosporium</i> disease of oats, the subject of a thesis for which he gained a PhD from the University of Glasgow in 1934. On 10 February that year he married Ada Catherine Long, a 31-year-old schoolteacher and daughter of William Edward Henry Long, factory manager. In 1936 he started work at the Potato Virus Research Institute in Cambridge as assistant to the director, Redcliffe Nathan Salaman. However, he had little interest in the work and in 1939 obtained a position as assistant plant pathologist at the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, based at the seed testing station near Edinburgh. During the Second World War, while on night-time fire watch duty, he compiled a card-index catalogue of British fungi. This catalogue, extended in later years, long provided a basis for understanding the distribution of these fungi, a major research interest throughout his career.<br>
<br>In 1944 Dennis was appointed assistant to Elsie Wakefield at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, succeeding her as head of mycology on her retirement in 1951. Together they published <span class="italic">Common British Fungi</span> (1953), one of the few popular fungus guides of the time, which was illustrated with his own watercolour paintings. At Kew his research focused on the systematics of higher fungi, especially the ascomycetes, an immense group containing many important plant pathogens as well as others of economic importance. He travelled widely, notably making a three-month visit to Trinidad in 1949, which included brief visits to Venezuela and Jamaica, and a longer visit to Venezuela in 1958. These trips were a basis for research into neotropical fungi and resulted in many papers and, most notably, his book <span class="italic">The Fungus Flora of Venezuela and Adjacent Countries</span> (1970). This classic account, again illustrated with his own watercolour paintings, remained a standard text for the area. He also became an international authority on the Xylariaceae, contributing seminal accounts for tropical America and the Congo which were described as &#145;the foundations of modern studies&#146; of these fungi  (Rogers, 1412).<br>
<br>However, Dennis was perhaps best known as an authority on discomycetes, publishing accounts for South America, the West Indies, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Africa and Europe, including the British Isles. His book <span class="italic">British Cup Fungi and their Allies</span>, the first modern account of British ascomycetes, copiously illustrated with his own line drawings and paintings, was published by the Ray Society in 1960. It was a highly successful and important contribution, widely used throughout Britain and beyond. It was later revised as <span class="italic">British Ascomycetes</span> (1968, with a second edition in 1978), and remained at the time of his death one of the most useful works on the subject.<br>
<br>At Kew, Dennis rose to the position of senior principal scientific officer, the highest available grade, and on retirement in 1975 he was appointed an honorary research fellow. During almost thirty years of retirement he continued working on fungal systematics and extended his interest in British fungi. He continued to undertake field work, especially in the Hebrides and elsewhere in Scotland, and made many published contributions, including two key books, <span class="italic">Fungi of the Hebrides</span> (1986) and <span class="italic">Fungi of South-East England</span> (1995), both published at Kew. The former, a comprehensive analysis of the Hebridean fungi, also provides a detailed comparison of these fungi with those of the rest of the British Isles. During a scientific career lasting more than sixty years, Dennis described many genera and species new to science, and published over 230 papers and books. Forty species and five genera of fungi were named in his honour during his lifetime. He also received several other distinctions, being elected an honorary fellow of the Botanical Society of Scotland, an honorary member of the British Mycological Society, and an honorary or corresponding member of several foreign mycological and botanical societies.<br>
<br>From an early age Dennis had a keen interest in history and geography, and he developed a truly remarkable and almost encyclopaedic knowledge of these subjects, partly gained, he claimed, from an interest in postage stamps. He retained this interest throughout his life, and he was a great philatelist, amassing an extensive collection of stamps from all countries but with special emphasis on those depicting flowers and fungi. He had a deep knowledge of botany, having studied the British flora from an early age, and also of geology. He compiled an extensive fossil collection and, while at Glasgow, studied the limestone bands in the Lanarkshire coalfield and the geology of the Isle of Mull.<br>
<br>Dennis was a great character and an immense store of knowledge, with an unrivalled understanding of the history of mycology, and especially the background and development of the Kew collections. Although an eccentric personality, who always bluntly spoke his mind, he was nevertheless a generous person, completely reliable and willing to help anyone who showed genuine interest in the subject. He also had a good sense of humour, once describing as new to science the genus <i>Golfballia</i>, based on material of burnt golf balls from east Africa and England received at Kew for identification. The original specimens are still preserved in the Kew collections. He had a distinctive and unforgettable appearance, balding and with a long beard, white with age, which he would frequently stroke when in conversation, and, except in the hottest of weather, always wearing an old Harris tweed sports jacket. He died at his home, 13 St Paul's Road, Richmond, London, on 9 June 2003, of heart disease, and was buried at the South Downs natural burial site near East Meon, Hampshire, on 30 June. He was survived by his son, Stephen, his marriage having ended in separation many years earlier.<br>
