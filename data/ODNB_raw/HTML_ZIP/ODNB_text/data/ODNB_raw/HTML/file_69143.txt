<span class="headword">Wight,  Sarah</span>  (<em>b. </em>1631), <span class="occ">mystic</span>, was born in September 1631, the daughter of Thomas Wight (<i>d</i>. before 1643), an official in the auditor's and exchequer's office, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Purcel. Her mother's first husband, Edward Vaughan, was the king's receiver and surveyor for Northamptonshire and Rutlandshire, with whom she had had a son, Jonathan.<br>
<br>Sarah Wight's account of her own severe illnesses, visions, and miraculous healing are found in the lengthy <span class="italic">Exceeding riches of grace advanced by the spirit of grace, in an empty nothing creature, viz. Mris Sarah Wight</span> (1647), first published when she was approaching sixteen years of age. The text also contains eyewitness testimonials, including that of her Independent, and later Particular Baptist, pastor, Henry Jessey, in whose name the book was published, corroborating the events which transpired chiefly between the years 1643 and 1647. The narrative gives little information about Sarah's early life except that for seven years her mother suffered from depression and terror of spirit, while living near Londonstone in London with her Irish maid. Unable to care for Sarah, Mary left her rearing to her mother-in-law, with whom Sarah grew up and was &#145;well trained up in the Scriptures&#146;  (Jessey, 5). Sarah was reunited with her mother at the age of nine.<br>
<br>In 1643, while living with her now widowed mother at Lawrence Pountney Lane, London, Sarah began to suffer from deep despair and spiritual angst, a condition which worsened over time. Jessey visited their home almost daily and, during the next four years, witnessed more than sixty ministers try to alleviate Sarah's illness. In February 1647 Sarah's spiritual agitation intensified, spawning a rash of dramatic suicide attempts. She ceased eating and drinking on 27 March 1647 and was apparently struck blind and deaf the following month. At this time she began to have trances during which she quoted texts from scripture and expounded upon them as if from memory; visiting ministers recorded these expositions verbatim. She appeared to be dying, and by 19 April, with the restoration of her sight and hearing, she seemed at peace, assuring her mother that she would no longer do herself harm. On 27 April the first account of her experiences was published, and over the next few months friends gathered to celebrate the spiritual and emotional &#145;healing&#146; that Sarah had experienced and to hear her quote passages of text, praise God for his mercies, and counsel others in similar circumstances. Theologians quizzed her upon doctrinal points, for explanations of difficult passages, and about the details of her trances. For sixty-five days Sarah fasted and remained in bed; on 11 June, following a dream that she would eat, arise, and walk again, according to the story in <span class="roman">Mark</span> 5, she ate her first meal and was able to leave her bed. A fortnight later she was able to walk again, and during the next weeks she celebrated her recovery with friends and family, attended church, and recuperated in a country house at Highgate. By the end of September she was restored to health, with a revised second edition of <span class="italic">The Exceeding Riches of Grace</span> appearing on 27 September.<br>
<br>Nothing further is known about Sarah Wight and her later life. Her ecstatic experiences as a young woman demonstrate how, during the seventeenth century, pious Englishwomen, particularly among the protestant laity, sought outlets for religious expression other than monastic life. Women prophets, mystics, and theologians published personal accounts of deeply spiritual encounters, and it is within this context that Sarah's own narrative should be read. Her story proved particularly popular: several editions of <span class="italic">The Exceeding Riches of Grace</span> were issued between 1647 and 1666, and the work was republished at least three times during the eighteenth century.<br>
