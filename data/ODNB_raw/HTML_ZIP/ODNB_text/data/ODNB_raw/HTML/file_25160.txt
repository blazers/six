<span class="headword">Seymour,  Edward</span>, first earl of Hertford  (1539?&#150;1621), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset (c.1500&#150;1552)")</script>, Edward VI's protector, and Anne (<i>c</i>.1510&#150;1587), daughter of Sir Edward Stanhope. Somerset had had two sons from an earlier marriage, but his wife, Katherine, was repudiated some time before 1535 and their children disinherited by act of parliament 32 Henry VIII before being restored by 5 and 6 Edward VI. Edward was probably the son born on 22 May 1539 and baptized in the chapel of Beauchamp Place with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk as his godfathers. He was educated with Prince Edward, knighted at his coronation on 20 February 1547, and styled earl of Hertford from 1547 until 1552. On 7 April 1550 he was briefly sent as a hostage to France. In 1551 his father and the marquess of Dorset planned a match between him and Lady Jane Grey.<br>
<br>Somerset's attainder and execution for felony initially did not affect his son's title or estates, but in April 1552 parliament passed a statute declaring forfeit all the Seymour lands and titles. He was made a ward of the crown and granted a few of his father's estates by letters patent of the king, but relied for financial support on his father's former secretary Sir John Thynne. Under Mary his mother was released from the Tower and given custody of her sons. He was a witness to Northumberland's execution, and restored to the blood by an act of parliament. Two months after Elizabeth's accession, on 13 January 1559, she restored to him the lands inherited by his father and created him Baron Beauchamp and earl of Hertford of the second creation.<h2>
<a name="MarriagetoKatherineGrey"></a>Marriage to Katherine Grey</h2>Some time in November or December 1560 Hertford secretly married Lady Katherine Grey (1540?&#150;1568) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25157/', "Seymour, Katherine")</script>], the queen's cousin, who was heir to the throne according to Henry VIII's will. Soon afterwards, in May 1561, he was sent to France possibly on a minor diplomatic mission and was intended to go from there to Italy as the companion of Thomas Cecil. Although some questions were asked about his suitability to act as a good influence on Cecil, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton (the English ambassador) spoke well of him and it was also said that he had made a good impression on the king of Navarre. On 12 August, however, he was recalled to England because his wife, now heavily pregnant, had confessed their secret marriage to Robert Dudley. On 5 September 1561 Hertford was placed in the Tower, where both he and Katherine were interrogated closely and separately. Later that month a son, <a href="#cosubject_25160">Edward [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was born. Thanks to the leniency of the warder, a second son was conceived and born in the Tower in February 1562. In May an ecclesiastical commission found the marriage invalid and Hertford was fined &pound;15,000 in Star Chamber for deflowering a virgin of the royal blood, breaking his prison, and repeating the fornication. At the same time he was expected to defray Katherine's expenses. Rents from his lands were diverted to the lord treasurer as part of the fine in 1564&#150;5, but not thereafter. In June 1568 Elizabeth agreed to take &pound;200 a year until &pound;10,000 was paid.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of plague in August 1563 Hertford was removed from the Tower and placed in the custody of his mother and stepfather, Francis Newdigate, at Hanworth, Middlesex. On several occasions Anne petitioned William Cecil and Robert Dudley on behalf of her son, but the queen refused to show leniency as she was extremely sensitive about the succession question and possibly suspected a plot against her. Though undoubtedly incorrect about there being political motives behind the marriage, her suspicions seemed confirmed when John Hales wrote a pamphlet defending it and Katherine's right to the succession. As Newdigate was implicated in Hales's activities, Hertford was removed from his care. After a short return to the Tower he was placed in the house of Sir John Mason.<h2>
<a name="Recoveringfortunes"></a>Recovering fortunes</h2>After the death of his wife on 27 January 1568 Hertford slowly shook off royal displeasure. He left Mason's custody late in 1568, but was still confined in various country houses until 1571, when he was allowed to attend court. On 2 February 1571 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, and on 30 August 1571 created MA at Cambridge. During 1571 Elizabeth released him from &pound;10,000 of his fine. By October 1572 she had remitted a further &pound;1000 and in December 1577 &pound;1000 more. In 1579 he had only &pound;1813 4<i>s</i>. 8&frac12;<i>d</i>. to pay. He spent much time at court, and was one of the magnates attending the queen during the ceremony of the king's evil in May 1582, hearing the trial of the earl of Essex, and receiving Marshal Biron, the French ambassador, in 1601. Yet, despite his rehabilitation, Hertford secured few rewards or important posts under Elizabeth. In 1578 he appeared on the commission of the peace for Wiltshire and the following year he was joint commissioner of musters. In 1588 he was one of seventeen men ordered to be at court with his personal forces. In 1592 he was appointed a commissioner to take oaths from the JPs of Northumberland, Hampshire, and Wiltshire. At last in 1601 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Wiltshire, Somerset, and Bristol.<br>
<br>While at Elizabeth's court Hertford met Frances Howard, daughter of Lord William Howard of Effingham, sister of the lord admiral, and maid of honour to the queen. By 1575 the two were on intimate terms. John Dee referred to her as the countess of Hertford in 1578, and Hertford's elder son addressed her as mother in 1582. In fact Elizabeth did not consent to their marriage until 1585. The countess died on 14 May 1598 leaving no issue. Three years later Hertford married Frances Prannell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70952/', "Stuart, Frances (1578&#150;1639)")</script>], the widowed daughter of Thomas, Viscount Howard of Bindon. The marriage was performed clandestinely without banns or licence and not in the parish church. They had no children, and she outlived him to die on 8 October 1639 after a third marriage, to Ludovick Stuart, second duke of Lennox and duke of Richmond.<br>
<br>Hertford never fully accepted the verdict of the ecclesiastical court that his first marriage was invalid, and his elder son, Edward, used the courtesy title Lord Beauchamp. Hertford proved an authoritarian father, closely supervising his sons' studies even after they had reached the age of twenty. When he learned in December 1581 that Beauchamp had exchanged vows and a ring with a kinswoman, Honora Rogers (her brother was married to Hertford's sister), he personally intervened to break off the relationship. In August 1585 he even arranged to have his son seized and brought to one of his houses in order to keep him away from Honora. The queen and council, however, took the part of Beauchamp, and Hertford had to accept the marriage as valid.<br>
<br>In 1589 Hertford's second son, Thomas, tried to secure a notarial instrument declaring himself legitimate, and in 1592 he initiated a legal appeal against the sentence that his parents' marriage had been invalid. Details of these proceedings, which were supported by his father, came to light in October 1595 just when the queen and her ministers were growing concerned about the publication of Robert Persons's book dealing with the English succession. The queen therefore acted speedily, and Hertford was sent to the Tower in November 1595, remaining there until 3 January 1596. Thereafter he was careful to avoid any suggestion that he might have an interest in the succession. Thus in 1601, when Arabella Stuart sent a servant to Hertford with a proposition of marriage between herself and his elder grandson, the sixteen-year-old William Seymour, Hertford immediately informed Robert Cecil. On Elizabeth's death Cecil was suspicious that Hertford might promote the candidature of his son, but Hertford immediately declared his recognition of James I.<h2>
<a name="UnderJamesI"></a>Under James I</h2>James I showed greater favour to Hertford. In June 1603 he was made <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Wiltshire. On 19 April 1605 the earl was sent to Brussels as ambassador-extraordinary to ratify the 1604 Anglo-Spanish treaty. In July 1605 and June 1611 he was granted lands. From June 1612 until March 1619 he was high steward of the revenues to Queen Anne. After he began legal proceedings in 1607 to have his elder son declared legitimate, the king agreed in 1608 to give Beauchamp and his heirs the right to inherit the title earl of Hertford on the present earl's death. James, however, would not overturn the bastardy judgment.<br>
<br>The secret marriage of Arabella to Hertford's grandson William in 1611 initially aroused royal suspicions against the earl and he was summoned to court. His willingness, however, to upbraid his grandson soon earned him the council's approval. Despite his anger at the marriage, he allowed William &pound;200 a year, while he remained in Paris. On the occasion of William's second marriage, to the daughter of the earl of Essex in January 1618, Hertford was said to have settled &pound;3000 on his grandson, his heir since Beauchamp's death in 1612.<br>
<br>Both monarchs honoured the earl of Hertford with royal visits. In 1591 Elizabeth stayed with him and Frances at his Hampshire mansion, Elvetham, during which time he put on an elaborate entertainment. Three surviving texts of the Elvetham entertainment have survived, as well as a woodcut illustration. James I visited him at his Wiltshire house, Tottenham Lodge, in 1603 and again in 1617 and 1620. Hertford acted as a patron of the musician John Daniel and possibly the poet Samuel Daniel. In addition, he had a company of players, which toured the provinces between 1582 and 1606 and performed before the queen at court on twelfth night 1592. It is on record that he employed Cornelius Ketel to paint a portrait of the queen in 1579, but no picture by that artist can now be identified. Hertford was also interested in military matters; he wrote a book on his father's victorious expedition to Scotland and was the recipient of a letter detailing a campaign in the Netherlands (1582). His entry-books as lord lieutenant were almost exclusively devoted to military matters. His parliamentary patronage was confined to the seats of Great Bedwyn and Marlborough.<h2>
<a name="Character"></a>Character</h2>Hertford was evidently a quarrelsome man. In addition to his argument with his son, he fell out with his brother Henry on his mother's death in 1587. In 1601 he became involved in a dispute between his sister Mary and her father-in-law, Sir Richard Rogers, about her jointure. He also came into conflict with his half-brother and nephew when a bill settling the Seymour lands came into the Commons first in 1601 and then in April 1604. He was involved in many lawsuits over land, including cases against lords Morley and Wentworth, Henry Knyvett, Henry Middlemore, and the dean and canons of Windsor. He found himself at odds with many gentry families in Somerset and Wiltshire, who tried to obstruct him in his work as lord lieutenant. In May 1606 Sir Henry Poole, the MP for Cricklade, attacked him in the Commons over allowances for the office of muster-master, and accused him of favouritism, bullying, and general high-handedness as lord lieutenant. His relationship with his third wife was often strained, and in one letter she implied that he was domineering and obstinate. Sir John Thynne, perhaps his oldest friend, accused him of ingratitude in 1579 for failing to promote a match and grant him some property.<br>
<br>Hertford enjoyed good health. He outlived his sons and grandson Edward, and remained active until his death, despite falling off his horse aged eighty-three. In March 1621 he fell in a palsy, and on 6 April he died at Netley in Hampshire. He was buried in Salisbury Cathedral. His career was not very illustrious for a man of his birth and talents, but his first marriage put paid to his chances of preferment with the queen. Thereafter his political importance lay in the closeness of his sons to the succession and concerns that he would exploit his connections to place one of them on the throne on Elizabeth's death. In this respect, memories of his father's seizure of power in 1547 probably influenced political judgement about him.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25160"></a><span class="headword">Edward Seymour</span>, Viscount Beauchamp  (1561&#150;1612)<span class="occ"></span>, the elder son and heir of Edward Seymour and Katherine Grey, was born in the Tower on 24 September 1561, the date written by his father in a <span class="roman">Bible</span> now at Longleat, and baptized two days later. Despite his official illegitimacy he was always given the courtesy title of Lord Beauchamp and owed his importance to inheriting the Suffolk claim to the royal succession.<br>
<br>Beauchamp spent his childhood with his mother and his paternal grandmother, Anne, dowager duchess of Somerset, a formidable woman. He was educated by private tutor at Hanworth, Middlesex. On 22 December 1576 he matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, and spent some time studying there, but from correspondence in the Longleat collection it appears he was a poor student and he certainly did not graduate. Some time in 1581 he exchanged vows and a ring with Honora Rogers, the daughter of Sir Richard Rogers of Bryanstone, Dorset, who had been living in his grandmother's household. Cowed by Hertford's fury on learning of the relationship, Beauchamp promised to marry his father's choice and asked Honora to return his tokens and letters. But in September 1582 he admitted that he was legally married to her, and appealed to Walsingham for permission to be with his wife. In March 1584 he was still trying to cohabit with Honora. On his way to London in August 1585 to plead his case before the queen, he was seized at Reading and taken to one of his father's houses. He was in such a distressed state that he threatened to take his own life if he were not set free. Both father and son then petitioned the queen and council, who took the part of Beauchamp. Evidently the family soon became reconciled, as in 1587 Beauchamp and his wife received a legacy from his grandmother, who had earlier been furious at the match. From the marriage three sons were born: Edward (1587&#150;1618), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25182/', "William Seymour (1587&#150;1660)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25166/', "Francis Seymour (1590?&#150;1664)")</script>.<br>
<br>Beauchamp showed no interest in the succession and consequently did not arouse the suspicions of Elizabeth. No proceedings were taken against him in 1595 when his father appealed against the decision of the invalidity of his first marriage, nor in June 1596 when his brother was implicated in some treasonous activities of Sir John Smith in Essex. James VI, on the other hand, did have anxieties that Beauchamp's following would press his claim to the throne on Elizabeth's death. In 1603, however, only a few insignificant men spoke out for Beauchamp's title while the council ignored it. Various accounts of Elizabeth's death report her rejection of Beauchamp as her successor with the words &#145;I will have no Rascall to succeed me, as who should succeed me but a King?&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 7042, fol. 237<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Soon after James I's accession a judicial appeal for Beauchamp's legitimacy was considered but apparently rejected. In 1607 Hertford again began legal proceedings to have his son declared legitimate, this time with more success. Although James would not overturn the original decision about his parents' marriage, Beauchamp was granted in 1608 the right to inherit the title earl of Hertford on the present earl's death. In fact, Beauchamp predeceased his father. He died on 13 July 1612 at Wick, Wiltshire, and was buried at Bedwyn Magna; later he was removed to a tomb in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
