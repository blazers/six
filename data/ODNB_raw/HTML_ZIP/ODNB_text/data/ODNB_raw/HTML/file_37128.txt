<span class="headword">Artis,  Edmund Tyrell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1789, <em>d.</em> 1847), <span class="occ">geologist and archaeologist</span>, was baptized on 11 September 1789 in Saxmundham, Suffolk, the eldest in the family of three sons and three daughters of James Artis, carpenter, and his wife, Mary Tyrell Watling. Little is known of his childhood, though it is said he developed a talent for drawing at an early age. At sixteen he went to work for his uncle, a London wine merchant, but by 1810 was established as a confectioner in Marylebone. In that year he married a Bristol woman and their only child, named Elizabeth after her mother, was born in 1811. During 1812 he attracted the attention of William, second Earl Fitzwilliam, who employed him at Milton, his Northamptonshire home; he became house steward in November 1816. Visits to Fitzwilliam's other residence at Wentworth Woodhouse led to an interest in geology, particularly the Carboniferous plant fossils found in coalmines in Yorkshire and Derbyshire. His studies, based on a collection of some 1500 specimens (later sold to the British Museum), resulted in the publication in 1825 of <span class="italic">Antediluvian Phytology</span>, a pioneering work in palaeobotany, illustrated by numerous plates taken from his own drawings. He became a fellow of the Geological Society in 1824.<br>
<br>Simultaneously Artis pursued an interest in archaeology. Searching for fossils on Fitzwilliam's estates at Castor, near Peterborough, in 1821, he discovered a large tessellated Roman pavement; this encouraged him to conduct a series of excavations, unusually systematic for their time, which continued until 1827. From 1823 he produced a series of plates illustrating his discoveries, largely engraved from his own drawings, entitled <span class="italic">The Durobrivae of Antoninus</span>. These appeared in a single volume in 1828, though the text to accompany them was never published. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1825. During this period he became friendly with the poet John Clare, a frequent visitor at Milton from 1820. Artis and Clare shared an interest in natural history and the latter often refers to Artis's opinions on local flora and fauna and to specimens which he saw in his collection of stuffed birds. Artis even made a plaster bust of Clare, who once described his friend as &#145;a clever man &amp; everything but a poet&#146;.<br>
<br>In August 1826 Artis left Milton to go into business on his own again. After long negotiations he purchased the Doncaster race clubhouse, opening in time to provide food and accommodation for racegoers attending the St Leger meeting of 1828. Although the venture was initially successful, race week alone could not sustain the business for the rest of the year; the property was leased and the clubhouse opened only in September. In 1830 Artis returned to Castor and for the next few years divided his time between his business interests in Doncaster and small-scale excavations at Castor. In 1844 he became a regional committee member of the newly formed British Archaeological Association and began to conduct larger excavations, communicating his discoveries through the association's journal. He dug chiefly on the duke of Bedford's land at Sibson, encouraged by finds made during construction of the Northampton to Peterborough railway. Work continued until shortly before his death in Doncaster on 24 December 1847. He was buried in the churchyard at Castor.<br>
