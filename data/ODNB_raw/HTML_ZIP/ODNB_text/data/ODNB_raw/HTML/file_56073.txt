<span class="headword">Fleetwood <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smyth]</span>,  Hester</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1714), <span class="occ">compiler of recipes</span>, was one of the seven children of Sir Robert Smyth (<i>c</i>.1594&#150;1669) of Upton, Essex, barrister, and his wife, Judith (<i>c</i>.1605&#150;1653), daughter of Nicholas Walmesley, esquire, of Dunkenhalgh, Lancashire. In 1651 or 1652 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9685/', "George Fleetwood (bap. 1623, d. in or after 1664)")</script>, a widower with two children, who had been a signatory of Charles I's death warrant and was now a militia commissioner for Buckinghamshire, commanding regiments of horse and foot. She lived with him at The Vache, a large house in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire. Their first two sons died young but a third son, Robert, was baptized in 1659 and lived until 1712. There were also two daughters, Hester and Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1663).<br>
<br>Hester Fleetwood's life, and her children's prospects, changed dramatically when her husband, who had been knighted by Cromwell in 1656, was punished as a regicide following the Restoration. He was imprisoned in the Tower, and in 1664 a warrant was issued for his deportation to Tangier; it is uncertain whether he was in fact sent to Tangier or allowed to go to America. The Vache was confiscated and sold but the Fleetwoods were allowed to continue there during the lifetime of Hester's mother-in-law, Anne Fleetwood. Richard Baxter mentions that in 1665 three nonconformist ministers were at Mrs Fleetwood's house, David Clarkson, Samuel Cradock (Hester's brother-in-law), and Edward Terry, and that one person died of plague there. Upon the death of Anne Fleetwood on 29 May 1673 the household had to disperse. Hester Fleetwood, who had been bequeathed the contents of her bedchamber, including purple curtains, and the contents of her maid's room, was now homeless. It may have been then that she became a Quaker and went to live with the Russell family at Jordans, Chalfont St Giles. She is first recorded as attending a Quaker meeting in 1678, at Larkins Green. Her son Robert became, instead of a country gentleman, a glass-seller in London.<br>
<br>While at The Vache, Hester Fleetwood compiled an interesting little manuscript recipe book, which still survives. The legibly written book contains over 300 cookery and medical recipes, including &#145;plague water the Vache way&#146; and a recipe for horse-dung water to prevent convulsions in children. A recipe for &#145;one that cannot make water&#146; required live bees to be dried on a hot tile and then powdered. An experimental recipe for rheumatic eyes called for two snails, each placed with the open end to the eye, and tied on with a cloth to prevent them crawling away. A diet drink containing senna and rhubarb was taken by Hester's brother-in-law Cradock, spring and autumn. Of several recipes for melancholy, Hester tried at least one with success. The book also showed how to make pheasants lay, how to make French bread, and how to slay any worm which has crept into a man's ear, within five nights at most. She was adept at shorthand, which she occasionally used to complete a recipe. The book has a long shorthand note dated 23 April 1661 (Charles II's coronation day, an event of great significance in a regicide's family), recording a dinner conversation with her mother-in-law, Anne, regarding various relatives and their religious persuasions.<br>
<br>Hester belonged to the Upperside meeting of Quakers. She died on 9 February 1714 and was buried on the 14th at Tring, contrary to her will of 11 August 1712 (witnessed by Thomas Ellwood), which requested interment in the Quakers' burying-ground at New Jordans, under the supervision of her friends Mary Baker and Bridget Russell. The will mentions &#145;my loving friends William Russell and Bridget his wife, with whom I have long sojourned&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/540, fol. 47). The recipe book passed into the hands of the Russell family at Jordans.<br>
