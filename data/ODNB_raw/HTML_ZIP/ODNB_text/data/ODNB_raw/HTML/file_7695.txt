<span class="headword">Dixie, Sir  Wolstan</span>  (1524/5&#150;1594), <span class="occ">merchant and administrator, mayor of London</span>, was the fourth son of Thomas Dixie, a husbandman of Catworth in Huntingdonshire, and of Anne Jephson. In 1547 he was apprenticed to a leading merchant adventurer and freeman of the Skinners' Company, Geoffrey Walkeden (whose daughter he subsequently married), and he secured his freedom in 1555. His own trading interests seem to have concentrated on northern France and the Low Countries, and he showed little interest in developing new trades (he did not follow his master's interests in the Russia trade). His subsidy assessments (&pound;50 in 1559, &pound;150 in 1564, &pound;250 in 1577, &pound;300 in 1582, and &pound;400 in 1589) are an indication of his steady accumulation of wealth. He invested in property in London and the provinces, owning the manors of Southwick, Wiltshire, and Market Bosworth, Leicestershire. But he was a Londoner at heart, residing successively in the parishes of St Lawrence Jewry, St Christopher-le-Stocks, St Mary Woolchurch, and St Michael Bassishaw, while maintaining a suburban retreat at Ealing.<br>
<br>Dixie was an assiduous member of his livery company, serving as master on no fewer than seven occasions. After service on the court of common council for Cheap ward (<i>c</i>.1559&#150;<i>c</i>.1570) and Cordwainer Street ward (1572&#150;4), he was elected to the court of aldermen on 4 February 1574, serving for Broad Street ward (1574&#150;93) and briefly for Bassishaw (1593&#150;4). He was a committed alderman, attending 60 per cent of the court's twice-weekly meetings during his tenure. He was sheriff of London in 1575&#150;6 and lord mayor in 1585&#150;6. On 6 February 1586 he was knighted. Dixie assumed the mayoral dignity against the shadows cast by the outbreak of war with Spain and escalating prices. There were rumours of anti-alien disturbances in the spring of 1586, and the tension among the ruling group is evident in Dixie's reaction to a personal attack upon him made at a Paul's Cross sermon on 6 March. George Closse, the minister of St Magnus, had criticized the lord mayor for what he considered to be Dixie's partiality in a case with which Closse had been involved several days earlier. Although Closse submitted at a well-publicized sermon at Paul's Cross on Palm Sunday as ordered by the court of high commission, Dixie remained dissatisfied and complained to the privy council. Refusing to accept the proffered private reconciliation, he was forced to content himself with the matter being put in suspension during his term of office, a compromise which may well have tainted his reputation for the rest of his term. It was fortunate for Dixie that the attention of Londoners was diverted by the horrific revelation of the Babington plot, the news of the capture of the conspirators in July being greeted with scenes of extraordinary jubilation in the capital.<br>
<br>Dixie married twice. His first wife was Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1567), daughter of his master, Geoffrey Walkeden. In 1569 he married Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1600), daughter of Sir Christopher Draper (<i>d</i>. 1581), lord mayor of London. It was a marriage which connected him with other leading members of the aldermanic bench, for Agnes's sisters married William Webb and Henry Billingsley, who became close friends and colleagues of Dixie. Dixie died on 8 January 1594 in the parish of St Michael Bassishaw in London and was buried there the following day. Dying without children, he left half of his goods to his wife, and the bulk of his estates to his great-nephew, Wolstan, later a prominent Leicestershire gentleman. His widow (who had custody of young Wolstan) remarried shortly after his death, taking as her husband William Hickman, a gentleman and a long-standing family friend.<br>
<br>Dixie's childless state helps to explain the extent of his charitable bequests totalling &pound;4484 13<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>., but his religious sympathies, which lay with the godly, also played a role. He left bequests to the strangers' churches in London and provided &pound;600 for the establishment of two fellowships and two scholarships at Sir Walter Mildmay's godly seminary, Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He provided for an annuity of &pound;10 to the support of a lecturer in the church of St Michael Bassishaw. Dixie counted among his friends William Ashbold, the conformist parson of St Peter Cornhill and chaplain to Archbishop Whitgift, Henry Holland, then lecturer at St Martin Orgar, and Thomas Crooke, the presbyterian-inclined lecturer at Gray's Inn and brother-in-law to Laurence Chaderton, master of Emmanuel. To Christ's Hospital, of which he had been president since 1590, he left the manor of Southwick. Other charitable activities were focused upon the manor of Market Bosworth which he had purchased from Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, in 1589. He left the Skinners a total of &pound;700 to establish a school for fifty to sixty poor scholars in the town, from which also one of the Emmanuel scholarships was to be drawn. There were, however, difficulties in getting the school properly established. The executors delayed the handover of money to the Skinners' Company and withheld the interest which had accrued. As the company declined to take on the charity without full funding, the lord keeper decreed in 1605 that Wolstan Dixie junior should enjoy the nomination of the schoolmaster and scholars.<br>
