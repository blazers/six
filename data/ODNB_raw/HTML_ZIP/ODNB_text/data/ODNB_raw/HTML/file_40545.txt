<span class="headword">Macfarquhar,  Colin</span>  (1744/5&#150;1793), <span class="occ">printer and publisher</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the son of James Macfarquhar, a wigmaker, and his wife, Margaret. On 13 December 1767 he married Jane, daughter of James Scruton, an accountant in Glasgow; they had one son and four daughters.<br>
<br>After an apprenticeship Macfarquhar probably became a master printer about 1767. Besides printing books he also published a number of titles, including Jean Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Osterwald's English edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> (<i>c</i>.1770); <span class="italic">The Psalms of David in Meter</span> (1771); <span class="italic">Letters Written by the Earl of Chesterfield to his Son</span> (1774&#150;5), in association with the paper merchant George Douglas and his friend and sometime partner the bookseller Charles Elliot; and several volumes of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine, or, Literary Miscellany</span> (1785&#150;1803), again with Elliot. Two of these publications resulted in litigation. Alexander Kincaid, in his capacity as the king's printer in Scotland, sued Macfarquhar for infringing on his alleged monopoly of printing bibles in Scotland but withdrew his complaint. On the other hand, the London bookseller James Dodsley, who had paid for a copyright on Chesterfield's <span class="italic">Letters to his Son</span>, persevered in his suit against Macfarquhar and other Scottish publishers in the court of session. It ruled against Macfarquhar, who had to destroy hundreds of copies of his press run. Like many other British publishers Macfarquhar tested the shadowy line between legal publishing and literary piracy.<br>
<br>Macfarquhar proved to be not only an aggressive businessman but also an exceptionally creative and able one. This can be seen from a history of his most important publication, the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, the first alphabetically arranged general encyclopaedia published in Scotland. The earliest edition appeared in instalments from 1768 to 1771 and as a three-volume set in 1771. Macfarquhar and his co-publisher, the engraver Andrew Bell, knew how to market their reference book: they were the first eighteenth-century British publishers to entitle their work an encyclopaedia, a word with selling power thanks to the reputation of the <span class="italic">Encyclop&eacute;die</span> edited by Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d'Alembert from 1751 to 1772; also they distinguished the <span class="italic">Britannica</span> from its competitors by publishing it in quarto rather than in octavo or folio and by featuring long synthesizing articles as well as short ones. In addition they kept costs down by printing the <span class="italic">Britannica</span> in Macfarquhar's printing shop and by assigning Bell the engraving of all the copperplates. The two lightened their task by choosing not to edit it themselves and instead selected William Smellie. He copied and abridged so much from other sources that this edition of the <span class="italic">Britannica</span> turned out to be undistinguished.<br>
<br>Macfarquhar and Bell then decided on an expanded second edition. In order to raise the capital they formed a syndicate with eight other Scottish publishers. This edition was published in instalments from 1777 to 1784 and in ten quarto volumes with imprints from 1778 to 1783. Bell remained responsible for the engravings and Macfarquhar for at least part of the printing. They named a new editor, James Tytler, who greatly improved the work by including biographies and by providing more depth on many subjects. The wholesale copying from earlier publications continued and caused threatened and actual lawsuits. Macfarquhar and Bell settled these by awarding sets to the aggrieved parties, Samuel Foart Simmons, John Murray, and George Robinson.<br>
<br>The third edition marks the high point of the eighteenth-century editions of the <span class="italic">Britannica</span>. Published by Macfarquhar and Bell alone and issued in instalments from 1788 to 1797, and then in eighteen quarto volumes in 1797, it was the first encyclopaedia published in Great Britain to be compiled by more than a handful of contributors. Bell kept on furnishing the engravings and Macfarquhar did some of the printing but this time Macfarquhar, a man of extensive learning despite his limited formal schooling, chose to edit the work himself. Before his death he had completed the first twelve volumes up to the article &#145;Mysteries&#146;. George Gleig, who took over after that, recruited such eminent contributors as John Robison and probably John Barclay but Macfarquhar deserves recognition for helping to make this edition an exemplar of the Scottish Enlightenment, the most informative general encyclopaedia in eighteenth-century Britain, and a best-seller with a press run reaching perhaps 13,000 sets. Still the publication of the third edition was not without difficulties. Like the second edition it resulted in a lawsuit; the farrier James Clark claimed that the sixty-one-page article &#145;Farriery&#146; had been copied from two of his books. The case was dismissed on a technicality in 1804, long after Macfarquhar's death on 2 April 1793, at the age of forty-eight. He was survived by his wife. Macfarquhar's estate included the eight-room house in Buccleuch Place, near Edinburgh, in which he died and probably &pound;12,500 or more, much of it from sales of the <span class="italic">Britannica</span>.<br>
