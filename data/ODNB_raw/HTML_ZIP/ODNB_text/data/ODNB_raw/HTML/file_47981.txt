<span class="headword">Watson,  Robert Irving</span>  (1878&#150;1948), <span class="occ">oil industrialist</span>, was born at Nith Bank, Dumfries, on 22 November 1878, the younger son of Thomas Watson, editor and proprietor of the <span class="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Standard</span>, and his wife, Nancy Hamilton. At Dumfries Academy, he became classical <i>dux</i>, or star pupil of his year.<br>
<br>Having determined on a career in the East, Watson obtained some legal training and in 1900 joined the Burmah Oil Company. At the company's agency in Rangoon, his talent for hard work and a capacity for unravelling the most complex issues marked him out for future promotion. In 1909 he married Caroline, daughter of Alexander Walker Mouat, a dentist from Edinburgh; they had a daughter and two sons. In 1912 Watson returned to become deputy manager in Burmah Oil's London office. Among his many tasks was that of maintaining regular contact with Robert Waley Cohen of Royal Dutch Shell over the workings of their eastern marketing agreements.<br>
<br>Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, Watson took charge of Burmah Oil's London office, later becoming a member of the petroleum pool board, which was responsible for allocating oil products throughout Britain. As his company's <i>de facto</i> managing director, although not appointed as such until 1920, he had the agreement of the chairman in Glasgow, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46808/', "Sir John Cargill")</script>, to overhaul systematically every part of the company's operations: for example, he introduced electrification of the drilling process in the Burmese oilfields and up-to-date refining and prospecting techniques. In 1921 he oversaw the company's acquisition of the languishing Assam Oil Company, and the expenditure of millions on making it efficient and profitable.<br>
<br>However, Watson failed in an ambitious attempt, together with Cohen, to form a major all-British oil group comprising Burmah Oil, Shell, and Anglo-Persian. Although Conservative ministers favoured selling the government-held shares in Anglo-Persian in order to help forward the merger, that company's top management was broadly hostile to the scheme, as were the Admiralty, the government of India, motorists' organizations, and the trade unions. It was finally rejected by the first Labour government in 1924, a decision upheld by the incoming Conservative cabinet later that year. Watson had very adroitly played a mediocre hand in promoting the scheme in Whitehall and Delhi; he was greatly disappointed at its collapse. As a second best, therefore, he helped to create a joint marketing organization, the Burmah&#150;Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India; in 1928 Burmah Oil bought a large shareholding stake in Shell, after which Watson was elected to that company's board.<br>
<br>Almost single-handedly, Watson turned the Burmah Oil Company from a collection of loose-knit managing agencies into a modern and centralized multinational company; this survived the depression years with reduced profits but a robust corporate structure. By the 1930s his reputation among oil magnates on both sides of the Atlantic was such that scarcely any important international petroleum conference would have been complete without this unassuming but resourceful man, who was always ready with a fresh idea or a relevant fact. Slight and dapper, he nevertheless had a personal authority that was out of all proportion to the relative smallness of his own company.<br>
<br>In 1938 Watson was offered the chairmanship of the Petroleum Board, designed to control oil distribution in Britain in the event of war. He declined the post, but when war came he arranged for the oilfields in Burma and Assam to increase production to meet the needs of the forces and civilian markets in the Far East. Then, after the entry of Japan into the war, Burma itself was invaded by the Japanese. Watson therefore had to agree to the destruction of the refineries in Rangoon and the oilfield installations, to deny them to the invaders. However, continued output from Assam, together with investment income from the shareholdings in Anglo-Persian and in Shell, kept Burmah Oil's profits at a reasonable level.<br>
<br>By 1943, when Watson became company chairman on Cargill's retirement, he was thinking ahead to the end of the war. He collected evidence for a future compensation claim from the British government for the assets destroyed in Burma, and attempted to cajole uninterested Whitehall civil servants into making plans for immediately resuming operations once Burma was recaptured. The company was not allowed to restart until 1946, by which time he was greatly concerned with the likely consequences for oil of the proposals, which became reality in 1948, for giving independence to Burma. However, Watson retired at the end of 1947, after a serious illness that year. He died of a heart attack on 26 January 1948 at his home, Lower Bowden, in Pangbourne, Berkshire. He was cremated at Reading, but his ashes were later buried at Dumfries.<br>
