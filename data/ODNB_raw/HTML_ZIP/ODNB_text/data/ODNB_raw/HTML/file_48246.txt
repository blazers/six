<span class="headword">Stone,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1711), <span class="occ">banker</span>, born probably in Winchester, was the son of Andrew Stone, a gaoler and licensed victualler, and his wife, Elizabeth. The Stones were a well-known Winchester family, involved in innkeeping and property ownership as well as the management of the city's prison. By the mid-seventeenth century the elder Andrew Stone had been made a freeman of the city and was accorded the title of gentleman. Little is known about the younger Andrew Stone's early life, but in the early 1690s he obtained an apprenticeship in London to Richard Smith, senior partner in the important City banking house known as the Grasshopper, which conducted business from 68 Lombard Street. The key influence in his appointment seems to have been the exercise of the perquisites of his father's office in Winchester, though it is also probable that the family had personal relations with Smith, who was closely connected with Carisbrooke, on the Isle of Wight.<br>
<br>Stone was apprenticed at a time when the Grasshopper, building upon its continuous history of goldsmith activity begun by Sir Thomas Gresham in the mid-sixteenth century, was transforming itself into a bona fide banking house. On 24 March 1697 Stone married Anne Holbrooke (<i>d</i>. 1725) at St Mary Abchurch in the City of London. The fact that his wife was also Smith's niece suggests the pattern of close ties between business and blood that had long been a key feature of England's great banking families. Shortly after the marriage Stone was taken into partnership by Smith and when the latter died in 1699 he became senior partner in the firm, then known as Stone &amp; Co. Early in his career at the Grasshopper he developed a close friendship with Thomas Martin, who was made a partner in 1703. From this time on the fortunes of the two families were closely linked, shaping the growth of the firm into one of the foremost London private banking houses over the eighteenth century. Indeed, Stone was the first of nine generations at the Grasshopper and no less than twenty-one of his descendants became bankers there.<br>
<br>Of his own children&#151;he and his wife had three sons and three daughters&#151;only his second son, Richard, took up a position in the bank, becoming a partner in the Grasshopper between 1731 and 1761. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26565/', "Andrew Stone")</script>, his eldest son, entered the service of the duke of Newcastle and later became commissioner of trade, customs, and treasures of the queen's household. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26571/', "George Stone")</script>, his youngest son, was made bishop of Ferns, co. Wexford, in 1731 and later, in 1747, became primate of Ireland. Andrew Stone died in London, probably at 68 Lombard Street, in 1711, in or before April. Significantly, he made a provision in his will for his share of the banking business to be offered to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53422/', "Thomas Martin (bap. 1680, d. 1765)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53428/', "Martin family (per. c.1700&#150;1832)")</script>] for the sum of &pound;9000, his sons all being under ten years of age at the time of his death. Thus, the continuity of the bank's business was assured and the lease on the premises passed to Martin. Following her husband's death Anne Stone returned to Winchester and was known to be leasing the porter's lodge at the city's Westgate in 1716. She died in 1725.<br>
