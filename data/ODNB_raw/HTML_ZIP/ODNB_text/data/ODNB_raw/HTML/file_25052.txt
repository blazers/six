<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Selden,  John</span>  (1584&#150;1654), <span class="occ">lawyer and historical and linguistic scholar</span>, was born on 16 December 1584 and baptized on 20 December at West Tarring, Sussex, the eldest son of John Selden of Salvington in the same county, musician and yeoman, and of Margaret, only daughter and heir of Thomas Baker of Rustington, Kent, gentleman. He had two brothers who died in infancy and a sister, Mary. In 1609 his father held over 80 acres with an annual value of &pound;23 5<i>s</i>.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerfriendsandpublications"></a>Early career, friends, and publications</h2>After attending the prebendal free school in Chichester, on 24 October 1600 Selden matriculated from Hart Hall, Oxford. He was admitted to Clifford's Inn in 1602 and to the Inner Temple in November 1603. Doubtless helped by the &#145;humanity, courtesy and affability&#146; of his courtly manners, on which the earl of Clarendon later remarked  (Clarendon, 1759, 1.31), Selden made a number of important friends and became well connected in London antiquarian and literary circles. His first close friend was Edward Heyward of Reepham, Norfolk, admitted to the Inner Temple a year later than he. By about 1610 Heyward had erected a row of sixteen chambers, and he and Selden shared rooms on the top storey until 1620, when Selden took over the whole suite. Adjoining the Inner Temple grounds was Whitefriars, the London house of his earliest patrons, Sir Henry Grey (1583&#150;1639), and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Grey (1582&#150;1651) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11530/', "Grey, Elizabeth, countess of Kent")</script>], sister-in-law of another patron, Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel. Selden also formed an early and lasting friendship with Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, more than a decade his senior, for whom he acted as a copyist and to whose extensive library he had access. Others of his circle included John Donne, Edward Herbert, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Samuel Daniel, the herald Augustine Vincent, and the travel writer Samuel Purchas.<br>
<br>Even as Selden engaged in the study of common law, he began scholarly research and writing in other fields. According to Anthony Wood, it was in London rather than in Oxford that Selden acquired his formidable linguistic competence: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Greek, Old English, Hebrew, Chaldean, Samaritan, Aramaic, Arabic, Persian, and Ethiopic were all cited in his published works. He soon made the acquaintance of Lancelot Andrewes, dean of Westminster from 1601 to 1605 and a long-term promoter of the study of oriental languages, and Andrewes's most notable pupil, William Bedwell, became a friend. Selden claimed to have assembled in 1605 the book on the gods of the ancient Middle East eventually published as <span class="italic">De dis Syris</span> (1617), and the dedication (to Cotton) of his work on the governance of England under the Britons, Saxons, and early Normans, <span class="italic">Analecton Anglobrittanicon</span> (1615), is dated 1607; probably both had undergone considerable additions and revisions in the meantime. By 1609 he had drawn together a collection of sources and comments on early English governance that appeared long after his death as <span class="italic">Englands epinomis</span> (1681).<br>
<br>In the following year Selden's first books appeared. <span class="italic">The duello, or, Single Combat</span> (1610) was a brief work on the history of the single combat, especially as a medieval means of proof. <span class="italic">Jani Anglorum facies altera</span> (1610) was a much more substantial Latin treatise on the ancient laws of England, dedicated to Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury. It provided the first relatively systematic and detailed account of the ancient Britons and Anglo-Saxons. It portrayed their constitutions as sharing sovereignty among the monarchs, nobles, clergy (first the druids and later Christian bishops and abbots), and freemen, and stressed the centrality of assemblies as places for the making, remembering, and interpreting of laws. &#145;These Assemblies do now sit in great State, which with a wonderful harmony of the Three Estates, the <i>King</i>, the <i>Lords</i>, and the <i>Commons</i>, or Deputies of the People [&#147;Trium Ordinum, Regis, Magnatum, remque plebis procurantium harmoni&acirc;&#148;], are joyned together to a most firm security of the publick&#146;. While ambiguous about the impact of the Norman conquest, sometimes arguing in favour of a major change in the laws of tenure by the conqueror and sometimes stressing the continuity of Saxon institutions and laws, Selden portrayed the parliaments of the early Norman kings as continuing under a new name the witenagemots or micel synods of the Saxons until, &#145;At length we borrowed of the <i>French</i> the name of <i>Parliaments</i>&#146; (J. Selden, &#145;The reverse or back face of the English Janus&#146; in his <span class="italic">Tracts</span>, trans. R. Westcot [A. Littleton], 1683, 94; <span class="italic">Jani Anglorum</span>, 126). <span class="italic">Jani Anglorum</span> first put forward his interpretation of the English constitution as a mixed monarchy that continued to shape most of Selden's relevant writings for the rest of his life.<h2>
<a name="Historicalandlegalprojects16121617"></a>Historical and legal projects, 1612&#150;1617</h2>Called to the bar on 14 June 1612, Selden worked throughout his life as a barrister in London. His legal career stimulated rather than impeded his other interests. He had a great love of poetry, and his own compositions were sufficiently regarded in his lifetime for John Suckling to include him in his poem &#145;A session of poets&#146; of 1637, but little of his verse survives. In 1610 he and Heyward provided commendatory verses for the collected poems of their friend Michael Drayton. In 1612 Selden's &#145;illustrations&#146; of the historical poems in Drayton's <span class="italic">Poly-Olbion</span> brought the research already carried out for <span class="italic">Jani Anglorum</span> and <span class="italic">Analecton Anglobritannicon</span> to a new, wider, English-language audience. Drawing upon a humanist historical method, these notes first articulated Selden's historical method by stressing the importance of &#145;Synchronisme&#146;, the using as primary sources documents from as close as possible to the historical events under analysis  (M. Drayton, <span class="italic">Poly-Olbion</span>, 1612, sig. A2<i>r</i>). His scholarly potential had begun to flower as he pursued simultaneous projects. Five years in a row substantial volumes in English and Latin came off the presses, starting with <span class="italic">Titles of Honor</span> (1614). In addition Selden wrote three short treatises and the first draft of <span class="italic">Mare clausum</span> for King James VI and I. Several of the works published during this decade displayed an extraordinary breadth and depth of learning, and two of them created a highly sophisticated new style of historical works published in the English language.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Titles of Honor</span> Selden acknowledged the contribution of his friends to his scholarly endeavour and personal life. He paid tribute to his &#145;beloved friend that singular Poet M. Ben: Jonson&#146;, while Jonson reciprocated with praise for &#145;his honord friend&#146; in a commendatory verse:<blockquote>
<div>
<i>Monarch</i>, in <i>Letters!</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>'Mongst thy <i>Titles</i> showne,<br>
</div>
<div>Of others <i>Honors</i>; thus, enioy thine owne<br>
</div> (sig. B1<i>r</i>, 2<i>r</i>, d1<i>r</i>)</blockquote>Selden also gave thanks for &#145;the Bounteous humanity and advise of theat learned Phisician Doctor Robert Floyd&#146; [Fludd] in helping him overcome a &#145;dangerous and tedious sicknesse&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>). The first edition of the work dealt historically with such European honorific titles as king, duke, count, baron, and knight, and also included special chapters entitled &#145;<i>The beginning of</i> feuds&#146; and &#145;Turkish <i>dignities</i>&#146;. Breaking away from the genealogical concerns of most heralds and kings of arms, it derived honour from virtue, portrayed all civil honours as granted by the sovereign, and dismissed any claim to a hereditary nobility independent of the state (including the mystique of blood so favoured by some renaissance nobles). Each chapter opened with a discussion of the derivation of a particular title and then detailed its history and variations within a comparative European context, usually beginning with the Roman empire and coming up to the fringes of his own day. Those on dukes and counts observed that under the Romans: &#145;<i>Dux</i> then properly was at first the <i>Generall of an Armie</i> under the Emperor&#146;  (pp. 182&#150;3). Constantine the Great created the rival office of count by sending out important men from the imperial court to govern in the provinces. Not &#145;long after <i>Constantine</i>&#146;, these two offices became &#145;equall&#146; in status  (p. 184). The successor jurisdictions in France, Italy, and Spain continued to use duke and count as titles for offices until under the Carolingians they became attached to particular territories held by feudal military tenure and inheritable. With the collapse of royal power in France, dukes and counts usurped most of the marks of sovereignty, until strong kings of France claimed back those lost powers in the late middle ages.<br>
<br>In Saxon England, &#145;dux&#146; and &#145;comes&#146; translated the officiary and honorary title of earl, while comes also translated the officiary title of ealdorman. After the Norman conquest, through the introduction of continental laws the new king transformed the nature of an earldom from personal or officiary, &#145;making it feudall, and hereditarie&#146;  (p. 229). Building upon the scholarship of Fran&ccedil;ois Hotman, Selden represented the inheritable military tenure of the feudal law as originating in the Frankish empire and spreading to Germany and Italy by conquest and elsewhere in western Europe by imitation. Although the Saxons had military tenures, as seen in the laws of King Cnut, &#145;Those kind of Militarie Fiefs or Fees as wee now haue, were not till the Normans&#146;  (p. 301). <span class="italic">Titles of Honor</span> displayed a mature and almost unparalleled grasp of continental evidence and scholarship (including works on provincial as well as national history), and an acquaintance with English evidence (including manuscripts); it also reflected on the nature of law itself.<br>
<br>The project of comparative legal history also informed Selden's notes to Sir John Fortescue's <span class="italic">De laudibus legum Angliae</span> in an edition published in 1616. He faced more squarely than most common lawyers the legal consequences of the Roman conquest of Britain, noting that native Britons not only &#145;affected, we see, Roman language, Rhetorique, Roman habit, Roman pleasures, diet, and the like&#146; but &#145;were not backward in affecting those laws, for which the languages and rhetorique was most usefull&#146;  (notes, 11&#150;12). The normal adjustments of time combined with the succeeding conquests of the Saxons, Danes, and Normans to alter both the society and its laws: &#145;As succeeding ages, so new nations (comming in by a Conquest &hellip;) bring alwaies some alteration&#146;  (ibid., 9). This combination of continuity and change deliberately deconstructed Fortescue's seamless web of law, stretching unbroken from the Britons to his own day, into a suitable series of historical events, marked by such collections as the laws of King Cnut, King Edward, and King William. Within this new historical interpretation, the Norman conquest now seemed like just one more conquest that kept old customs and added new ones&#151;not an unobtrusive or a catastrophic event.<br>
<br>Selden's notes to <span class="italic">De laudibus</span> also articulated a new vision of the English &#145;state&#146; as grounded in a particular limitation of the laws of nature made at the foundation of the organized society that succeeded Roman rule. The common law of England began when &#145;naturall laws [were] limited for the conveniencie of civill societie here&#146;. Thereafter those limitations &#145;have been &hellip; increased, altered, interpreted&#146;, and became like &#145;the ship, that by often mending had no piece of the first materialls&#146;, but &#145;yet (by the Civill law) is to be accounted the same still&#146;  (notes, 19). This provided a historical model for interpreting the laws of any independent jurisdiction. From the ancient past to the present, societies changed individual laws within the context of an ongoing distribution of powers made at their foundation, but as new laws helped each society to adjust to ever-changing needs, the shape of the &#145;state&#146; remained the same. In England, this was a mixed monarchy in which the king, nobility, clergy, and freemen had always shared in lawmaking by custom and statute.<br>
<br>Between two famous English works appeared Selden's <span class="italic">De dis Syris</span>, a substantial treatise on the gods of the people surrounding the ancient Jews mentioned in the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> and the prophets, and their relationship to the gods of the ancient Greeks and Romans. In his lengthy prolegomenon he took a remarkably open approach to the belief in multiple gods of the ancients and their instruments of worship. He drew both on the writings of the ancient Jews, Greeks, and Romans (including some inscriptions), and on such medieval Jewish grammarians and commentators as Abraham ibn Ezra, Levi ben Gershon (Gershonides), Benjamin ben Jona, David Kimchi, Moses of Copucy, Solomon Iarchi (Rashi), and Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides). This marked a significant shift in attitude, for in 1610 he had dismissed &#145;<i>Talmudical</i> Traditions&#146; as &#145;Poetick Fictions taken upon trust&#146;  (&#145;English Janus&#146;, 8).<br>
<br>In response to an enquiry from Ben Jonson about scriptural arguments adduced against cross-dressing, Selden wrote on 28 February 1616 a learned letter which disclosed several of the novel interpretations developed at length in <span class="italic">De dis Syris</span>, including the derivation of ancient European gods and goddesses from Asian deities, the report that &#145;Men did honor and invoke Venus in women's attire, and women the like to Mars in men's armour&#146;, the startling theory that &#145;the greatest names in the Eastern theologie of the Gentiles, were expressly noted by both sexes, and according to that mysterie of community of sexes, were worshipt&#146;, the conclusion that &#145;The self same was in Europe, where nothing of that kind was, if not traduced out of Asia&#146;, and the foundation of the origin of Mars and Venus in &#145;the masculin-foeminin or generative power supposed in the Sunne, or the Sunne and Moon, which were the first creatures idolatrously worshipt&#146;  (Rosenblatt and Schleiner, 66&#150;70). No wonder this imaginative and controversial study of comparative religion won accolades from continental scholars.<h2>
<a name="TheHistorieofTithes"></a>The Historie of Tithes</h2>The most celebrated of Selden's treatises from this decade, <span class="italic">The Historie of Tithes</span> (1618), marked a major refinement in his theory and practice of history. Dedicated to Sir Robert Cotton, it praised his &#145;inestimable Library&#146;, which assured &#145;a curious Diligence in search after the inmost, least known and most usefull parts of Historicall Truth&#146;  (sig. A 2<i>r</i>). The preface recommended the scrutinizing of earlier interpretations and of all evidence with a searching, but moderate philosophical scepticism, which helped to clear away unsound interpretations and to promote soundly based truth. Selden also encouraged other scholars to verify his own representations of the past. Also key to his method was his great respect for &#145;true <i>Philologie</i>&#146; and &#145;her two Hand-maids <i>Curious Diligence</i> and <i>Watchfull Industrie</i>&#146; who discover &#145;many hidden Truths&#146; not really accessible to &#145;any one restraind Profession&#146;  (pp. xii, xix). Marginal notes and a full bibliography of manuscript sources provided readers with access to the evidence presented in the text.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Historie of Tithes</span> offered political advice on an issue of burning contemporary relevance. Between 1605 and 1613 George Carleton (who became successively bishop of Llandaff and of Chichester), Thomas Ridley (a prominent civil and canon lawyer), and Foulke Robarts (a Norwich divine) had drawn upon the interpretation of medieval canon lawyers and some historical evidence to make strident attacks upon the lay ownership of tithes. Selden detected no link between ancient Jewish tithes and those of medieval Christian Europe. During its first four centuries, voluntary charity funded the Christian church. During the next four centuries, pious laymen started to offer perpetual endowments, including tithes, to particular monasteries and churches, but retained control of the patronage of the resulting livings. With careful philological readings of contemporary primary sources Selden deconstructed the long-standing assertions that tithes had existed by the law of nature and that parish clergy had collected tithes by divine right during the first 800 years of Christianity.<br>
<br>During the next 400 years, Selden explained, laymen began to dedicate tithes more frequently to particular churches or monasteries. The foundation and endowment of parish churches by laymen and the attachment to them of earlier gifts previously paid into a common diocesan fund created a parochial structure. During this era the clergy began to preach that tithes belonged by divine right to parish churches and to use this theory in an aggressive attempt to extend ecclesiastical power. Secular laws proclaimed by Charlemagne marked the first recorded attempt to create a legal right to tithes in western Europe. The four centuries from 1200 to 1600 witnessed the spread of enforced tithes over the whole of western Europe, the triumph in canon law of an argument for their parochial right, and the suppression of evidence for earlier, voluntary gifts in various repositories of ecclesiastical records. So successful was this clerical campaign for compulsory parochial tithes by divine right that secular laws began to enforce the collection of tithes within their jurisdictions.<br>
<br>In Anglo-Saxon England parishes came into existence largely as foundations by laymen who endowed them, and the argument that tithes had always belonged by divine right to the parish priest was anachronistic nonsense. Listing many references to lay consecrations of property and income to the church found in early manuscripts, Selden concluded that before the reign of King John lay tithing was voluntary, and thus many of the so-called appropriated tithes traced their &#145;chief originall from these arbitrarie Consecrations&#146;  (pp. 290&#150;91). This brilliant reading of manuscript sources creatively reinterpreted the meaning of parishes in the early English church and stressed the positive role of laymen in the endowment of the church.<br>
<br>Selden also discovered that the general enforcement of divine-right tithes had spread across the face of western Europe as the result of a well-planned and executed programme of legal innovation. Starting in earnest about the year 1200, the enterprise reached a climax under Pope Innocent III and accompanied the climb of the papacy to the zenith of its political power in western Europe, including the England of King John. However, English common law, like the secular laws of other states in western Europe, came to enforce customary payments of cash in composition for crops and of fixed quantities other than a tenth; it also adjudicated any disputes over the rights of ownership of appropriated tithes. The aggressive clerical invasion of the property rights was eventually met by the statutes of the sixteenth century that controlled tithes and dissolved monasteries. As always for Selden, the law of God applied only as enforced through the laws of particular states. Underlying the occasionally flaming heat of the <span class="italic">Historie of Tithes</span> stood a profoundly protestant version of Christianity which envisaged a church governed by the prince and parliaments, integrated into society, and enriched by the creative talents of laymen, as well as those of the clergy.<br>
<br>A &#145;Review&#146; at the end of the <span class="italic">Historie of Tithes</span> provided a brief history of the Roman law to show how it could not rightly claim to have ruled even western Europe in an unbroken sequence and pictured William I, his barons, and those &#145;learned in the laws&#146; (identified as &#145;the common Lawiers of that time, as <i>Godric</i> and <i>Alfwin</i>&#146;) gathering together as a parliament in the fourth year of the conquest to hear and confirm the &#145;former Laws of the Kingdome&#146;  (p. 482). This vivid image of the historical triumph of the king-in-parliament appeared just in time for Selden's political career of the following decade. King James and his favourite, the marquess of Buckingham, forced Selden to withdraw <span class="italic">Historie of Tithes</span> from circulation, apologize to the privy council for the mistake of its publication, and endure in silence the attacks on it made by his critics. However, he would neither admit that it presented false evidence or interpretations nor retreat from the central thesis that the law of God found enforcement only in the laws of particular jurisdictions.<h2>
<a name="Legalhistorianandscholar16211628"></a>Legal historian and scholar, 1621&#150;1628</h2>In 1621 Selden received an opportunity to put his historical and constitutional ideas into action when employed as an expert legal historian by the House of Lords. This produced two concrete results, a draft roll of standing orders produced with Henry Elsyng, the clerk of parliament, and a lengthy report on the privileges of the Lords, including a section on the judicature, entitled &#145;The priviledges of the baronage in England&#146; (Parl. Arch.). The latter used historical evidence to establish such &#145;speciall rights&#146; as proxies, freedom from lawsuits during the sitting of parliament, and the power of judicature, and such &#145;private&#146; privileges as trial by peers and giving evidence by a protestation upon honour instead of upon oath  (fols. 2<i>v</i>, 98<i>r</i>). Although the treatise vested judicature in the Lords, Selden was imprisoned, ironically, on suspicion of vesting it in the Commons. The intervention of Lancelot Andrewes, bishop of Winchester, and the newly appointed lord keeper, John Williams, dean of Westminster and bishop of Lincoln, obtained a fairly quick release.<br>
<br>In 1621 Selden also acted as a legal consultant and a researcher for Francis Bacon, Viscount St Albans, gathering sources for the latter's history of Henry VII. His fullest statement on method appeared as a preface to Augustine Vincent's <span class="italic">A Discoverie of Errours</span> (1622). Selden commended Vincent for his diligent reading not only of published work but also of &#145;the more abstruse parts of <i>History</i>, which ly hid either in privat <i>Manuscripts</i>, or else in the publique <i>Records</i> of the Kingdome&#146;  (sig. A1<i>r</i>). Selden privileged those &#145;Acts of the State&#146; preserved in the public records as the most extensive and reliable historical sources available. To sceptical critical analysis of sources he now added a quantitative imperative: the more contemporary and complete the sources, the more truthful the historical account.<br>
<br>During the 1620s Selden became involved in an impressive number of scholarly enterprises. On 24 May 1621 he wrote to James Ussher, then bishop of Meath, that a new edition of <span class="italic">Titles of Honour</span> was in the press. It probably drew upon a large number of studies, manuscripts, and printed public records. Selden's correspondence with Ussher from the 1620s dealt with an incredible range of scholarly topics, including the siting of churches in antiquity, the Samaritan <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> (especially interesting for its chronology in comparison with those contained in the Hebrew and Greek versions), and British historical materials; in addition, they exchanged books and manuscripts, including many from Cotton's library. Selden's knowledge of Anglo-Saxon had improved to the degree that Ussher could suggest, when returning Cotton's &#145;two Saxon Annales&#146; in August or September 1625, that Selden would earn the gratitude of antiquaries if he produced a composite Anglo-Saxon chronicle, but this came to nothing.<br>
<br>In 1623 Selden published a critical edition of the history <span class="italic">Eadmeri monachi Cantuariensis, historia novorum &hellip; sub Guilielmis I et II et Henrico I Angliae regibus</span>. Dedicated to Bishop John Williams, it included an edition of the &#145;laws of William I&#146; (these displayed a striking similarity to the <span class="italic">Leges Edwardi Confessoris</span> printed by William Lambarde and provided evidence for a strong continuity across the potential break of the Norman conquest) and extracts from the Lichfield chronicle and the history of the pseudo-Ingulf, sources cited often in his early works. Selden saw Eadmer's text as an authentic contemporary voice that spoke vividly about the greedy exploitation of the revenues of the church by William II and the powerful political will of such churchmen as archbishops Lanfranc and Anselm. Since he had already singled out this period as one that had witnessed the powerful intrusion of popes and other clerics in secular affairs, he hardly accepted the theory of ecclesiastical independence from secular power supported by Eadmer. Five years later he published <span class="italic">Marmora Arundeliana</span> (1628), an edition of the classical inscriptions in Greek from the marbles collected from Asia Minor by Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, with an introduction and notes. It contained the text of a treaty and a major chronology of considerable importance to European classical scholars, as well as a philological discussion of the word &#145;<i>nomos</i>&#146; that explored the relationship of music, poetry, and law among the ancient Greeks.<h2>
<a name="MPinthe1620s"></a>MP in the 1620s</h2>In 1623 Selden's old friend and patron Henry Grey succeeded to the earldom of Kent and engaged the lawyer as the manager of his estates. The following year Selden was returned as MP for Lancaster, perhaps through the help of the earl of Pembroke, the lord chamberlain and brother-in-law of the countess of Kent. He became an effective new member of the Commons, searching precedents for the actions of the house and serving on committees but speaking only occasionally. In 1626 he sat for Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, most probably as a client of the earl of Hertford. Selden shared a number of goals with members of the Seymour network, including a strong dislike of the duke of Buckingham, support for constitutional monarchy, and a belief in reformed religion. He played a leading role in attacks made upon Buckingham, obtaining admission into the house for Sir Robert Howard, who lived openly with the countess of Purbeck (the wife of Buckingham's brother John), and working with Sir John Eliot, Sir Dudley Digges, and others on what became the attempted impeachment of the duke. Selden spoke forcefully, sat on the subcommittees that assembled the charges, dug up precedents for the procedures adopted, and was one of eight managers who presented the accusations against Buckingham to the Lords on 8 May. Actions against the duke failed with the dissolution of this parliament, but Selden helped to transform the transgressions of royal servants into a perceived threat to the ancient constitution.<br>
<br>Failure to obtain funding in parliament forced the privy council to raise money, troops, and supplies by other means to continue the war against Spain and the empire, and extend it to France. When five knights imprisoned for refusing to lend money to the king sought bail through a writ of habeas corpus, Selden became one of the counsel for the defence. Most of his legal work involved property law; this was the only high-profile case with criminal implications that he ever handled, and one of only two of his cases for which copious evidence has survived. In this hearing with wide-ranging constitutional ramifications he approached his argument as an advocate but also as a historian. When Sir Robert Heath, the attorney-general, defended the royal prerogative to act without normal restraints during a time of crisis, Selden argued that the crown must follow recognized procedures, &#145;without which we have nothing&#146;, or else jeopardize the ancient liberties of freeborn Englishmen: &#145;no man can be justly imprisoned by either of them [the king or the privy council], without a cause of the commitment expressed in the return&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.17). Using an expert contextual reading of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> chapter 29, Selden argued that if &#145;due process of the law&#146; meant &#145;according to the laws&#146; in general, as suggested by attorney-general Heath, then &#145;the freeman shall have no privilege above the villain&#146; an obviously preposterous position for people who lived in early thirteenth-century England  (ibid., col. 18). Selden's humanist interpretation, however, did not obtain bail for his client, as the judges remanded the prisoners back to gaol, with the lord chief justice, Sir Nicholas Hyde, noting that the precedents cited in the case told against them.<br>
<br>Discretionary imprisonment, the billeting of troops, imposition of martial law in England, and extra-parliamentary taxation or loans all became leading grievances when the next parliament assembled in March 1628. Selden sat for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, again as a client of the earl of Hertford. Named to fifty-seven committees and six subcommittees, he ranked among the top five committeemen in this session. In addition, his ninety-eight recorded speeches in the house and committee of the whole and twenty-six in the conference of 16 and 17 April helped to elevate him into a position of leadership. Drawing upon his wide learning Selden led the attack against discretionary imprisonment and martial law. His interpretation of the English constitution as a mixed monarchy from the very beginning helped to shape strongly felt grievances into resolutions and to collect them into a bill to uphold the traditional liberties of free Englishmen. However, Selden could not agree with the move made by Sir Edward Coke, supported by Sir Francis Seymour, to change from a bill to a petition of right on the grounds that it had less force, but he played a prominent, if somewhat diminished role in the debates which led to the passage of the petition.<br>
<br>In the session of 1629 Selden retained his position of leadership, strongly attacking the printing of the petition of right with the king's first answer (the one unacceptable to the Lords and Commons), passionately defending the parliamentary privilege of John Rolle, whose goods were seized for his refusal to pay tonnage and poundage, gratuitously insulting Secretary Sir John Coke (the primary spokesman for the crown in the Commons), and, in general, helping to polarize differences between royal servants and their critics. On the last day of the session Selden not only supported a vote on the resolutions moved by Sir John Eliot, but commanded the speaker (as the servant of the house) to put the question on pain of being replaced. Ironically, these actions subverted Selden's own ideal, which depended upon the co-operative working together of the king, Lords, and Commons. They also helped to make King Charles out of love with parliaments.<h2>
<a name="Imprisonmentandpublicationsofthe1630s"></a>Imprisonment and publications of the 1630s</h2>Shortly after dissolution Selden and eight other members of the Commons came under the careful scrutiny of the privy council. Questioned about his part in the events of the last day of the session, Selden lost his will to resist and provided less than truthful answers. On the night before the justices were to deliver their decision on bail King Charles moved the prisoners to the Tower, where they rested outside the jurisdiction of the king's bench. From 24 June 1629 until the summer of 1630 Selden suffered close imprisonment, although he soon got access to his books and papers and moved in and out of the Tower from 1631 onwards. Only an apology made to the king in 1634 brought a final release without bail. These years of enforced leisure allowed Selden to finish two scholarly projects and start new ones.<br>
<br>A monument to the wide-ranging mastery of medieval continental and English sources and studies, the weighty second edition of <span class="italic">Titles of Honor</span> (1631) drew its evidence widely. As well as providing a model for a true history based upon many primary sources, this edition also sought to establish a solid foundation for a new philosophy of politics that would emulate the revolution in astronomy brought about by &#145;Copernicus, Tycho, Galileus, Kepler&#146;  (sig. &para;2<i>r</i>), although Selden's political advice remained more than a little obscured by the details of his analytical narrative.<br>
<br>Attempting to chart the origin and development of the titles of monarchy, nobility, and gentility in western Europe from the end of the Roman empire to the present, this new edition dissolved the unitary feudal law interpretation espoused in the first edition into various national, provincial, or local feudal laws. Selden portrayed these jurisdictions as a series of ancient constitutions, each having its own &#145;state&#146; or &#145;frame of government&#146; and its own feudal customs. Only the titles of emperor and king received a fully comparative treatment, with those of duke, count, baron, and knight unfolding country by country as rulers carried out their own adaptation of northern European customs to Roman offices. The Gothic king Theodoric, whose chancellor Cassiodor was a Goth &#145;bred up in the learning of the Romans&#146;, marked a key transition in linking Roman titles and northern tenures  (p. 302). Selden's astute awareness of variation over time and space combined with his sophisticated representation of fealty, homage, service, and investiture with land to verify the overall interpretation.<br>
<br>Like their continental counterparts, the Anglo-Saxon kings of England shaped a new &#145;frame of government&#146;, using as their &#145;subordinate Titles of Temporall Honour&#146; those &#145;of <i>Etheling</i>, <i>Ealdorman</i>, and <i>Thane</i> or <i>Thegn</i>&#146;  (p. 603). Selden's deepened understanding of Anglo-Saxon sources allowed him to provide a much more sophisticated analytic and chronological representation of these titles. Anglo-Saxon charters and <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> showed that the Saxons had established the feudal holding of land by military service, and the Normans had taken it over and reshaped it. Since twenty years could not create a custom, Selden argued, historians could trust such manuscripts as <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> as detailed guides to the military and fiscal obligations due from across the realm under the late Anglo-Saxon kings. Considerable evidence also showed how the highest officers in the land, ealdormen and earls, along with high-ranking churchmen and thegns, governed the realm through presiding over shire courts or witnessing royal charters. Occasionally the great men of the realm gathered together as a witenagemot or a micel synod &#145;which afterward was from the <i>Romance</i> Dialect stiled a Parliament&#146;  (p. 613). These assemblies advised in matters of state and made and interpreted laws, exercising both deliberative and judicial power. Here lay the origins for the Norman gatherings of tenants-in-chief of the crown and for later parliaments.<br>
<br>The Norman conquest brought few changes to patterns of landholding and governance, but replaced Saxon feudal thegns by Norman barons. Selden discussed at great length the feudal and military character of the early Norman baronage, the nature of the knight's fee as a grant of land designed to provide the service of a professional warrior, and the transformation of a baronage by tenure into one defined by receiving an individual summons to parliaments. These interpretations represented a major scholarly accomplishment, and they made the conquest of 1066 look like just one of many moments of innovation, one additional adjustment of northern customs to Latin offices, carried out through an assembly of notables. Indeed, the second edition of <span class="italic">Titles of Honor</span> provided sophisticated historical support for Selden's interpretation of the mixed monarchy of England, not least by placing it in a plausible, equally well-supported context of European ancient constitutions. It portrayed the continual calling of parliaments as a necessary part of English governance.<br>
<br>In the 1630s Charles I was looking for more acceptable advice, so Selden, encouraged by courtiers, presented a peace offering, <span class="italic">Mare clausum</span> (1635), which defended British sovereignty over a wide expanse of sea. First written about 1619 and then revised to take account of the minimalist theory of natural law contained in Hugo Grotius's <span class="italic">De jure belli ac pacis</span> (1625), it combined a lengthy, sophisticated theoretical discussion of law with a partisan and reasonably well-documented history of the exercise of maritime dominion. Book 1 argued: &#145;That the Sea, by the Law of Nature or Nations, is &hellip; capable of private Dominion or proprietie as well as Land&#146;, and book 2: &#145;That the King of <i>Great Britain</i> is Lord of the Sea flowing about, as an inseparable and perpetual Appendant of the British Empire&#146;. The structure reflected Selden's view of the link between theory and history, law and fact: the capability of dominion arose to a significant extent from the evidence of dominion exercised over the sea in the past  (J. Selden, <span class="italic">Of the Dominion, or, Ownership of the Sea</span>, trans. M. Nedham, 1652, 2).<br>
<br>In order to challenge the assumptions of those who had supported free trade on open waters, <span class="italic">Mare clausum</span> started with definitions of &#145;sea&#146; (which included the oceans and seas nearly surrounded by land) and &#145;dominion&#146;, and discussion of the nature of &#145;law&#146; (&#145;Jus&#146;). The binding law of nations and the law of God as revealed in scripture, although &#145;reputed by men to bee unchangable&#146;, became enforceable only through &#145;<i>Additions</i> or Inlargements&#146;, which included the interpretations of judges and commentators  (p. 13). Positive laws (customs, statutes, contracts, or treaties) transformed the universal laws of God and nature into enforceable laws with concrete penalties. Most existing legal systems fit into the categories of &#145;<i>Civil</i>&#146; law (the laws of particular societies) or the &#145;<i>Common Law of divers Nations</i>&#146; (laws jointly accepted by more than one state), but some occupied a third category, the &#145;<i>Law of som</i> or <i>divers Nations, Civil</i> or <i>Domestick</i>&#146; (international law accepted as binding by one or more states; p. 14). The last of these opened a place for the exercise of dominion over the sea.<br>
<br>Selden then turned to communal and private dominion. The parcelling of lands and goods derived not from the laws of God or nature, which were neutral on the subject, but from a covenant involving the &#145;consent of the whole bodie or universalitie of mankinde (by the mediation of something like a compact, which might binde their posteritie)&#146;  (p. 21). Even before they formed societies, occupiers could establish a preponderant use over a particular piece of land previously uninhabited. As abundant theory and practice demonstrated, explicit or implicit contracts turned the lands that they occupied into dominion, made it capable of allocation or inheritance, and established distinct local property laws. Dominion over the sea, however, had not remained uncontested. Through a careful examination of the practice of &#145;the more civilized and more eminent Nations of the past and present Age&#146;, whose laws and treaties showed that claims over adjoining seas &#145;hath been received into Custom, as a thing very usual, and agreeable to Law&#146;  (pp. 45, 53), Selden provided copious evidence to support the exercise of maritime dominion in general and of ancient and modern British dominion over the surrounding seas. These detailed discussions of ancient and medieval military and diplomatic affairs paid equal attention to the royal appointment of admirals and to parliamentary statutes and, while revealing fissures beneath the surface of the text, sugared the pill of mixed monarchy for Charles I with the sweetness of royal maritime sovereignty. Written in Latin for an international audience, <span class="italic">Mare clausum</span> constituted a classic defence for the extreme position that states could legitimately claim and exercise extensive sovereignty over the high seas.<br>
<br>Although relatively brief, Selden's two studies of ancient Jewish society demonstrated his new mastery of the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> and provided the first taste of a passion for Jewish studies that dominated his scholarship for the last two decades of his life. On 4 August 1625 Selden wrote to Archbishop James Ussher asking about the differences between the Samaritan and Hebrew versions of the <span class="roman">Torah</span>. On 2 November 1627 Ussher replied with corrections to Scaliger's Samaritan chronology and discussed the related problems that fascinated both scholars. Ussher knew that Selden read Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew and assumed that he also read Aramaic; another correspondent thought in 1634 that Selden was translating the &#145;Alcoran&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Selden MS, supra 108, fol. 52<i>r</i>). Instead, he had honed his skill in Aramaic and Hebrew and plunged deeply into a series of works based strongly upon the <span class="roman">Torah</span>, the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, and Jewish commentaries.<br>
<br>The extent of this shift appeared in Selden's dedication of the joint printing of <span class="italic">De successionibus in bona defuncti</span> and <span class="italic">De successione in pontificatum Ebraeorum</span> (1636) to Archbishop William Laud. In the parliamentary session of 1629 Selden had attacked Laud, then bishop of London, for licensing bad books and refusing to license attacks on Arminianism or popery. With the shift in Selden's research during the 1630s, Laud's library proved very useful and the two men formed a friendship. Laud sent Hebrew books to Selden to settle the question of their authorship and also helped to negotiate his reconciliation with King Charles. In the dedication of 1636, Selden assured &#145;<i>Antistes</i>&#146; Laud that he was not one of those Hebraists who deserted to the other side, like the extreme sabbatarians, but explored Jewish wisdom in order to improve Christianity. He praised Laud for his &#145;incomparable&#146; gift of a voluminous quantity of oriental manuscripts to the library of Oxford  (sig. A1<i>r</i>). However, Selden had not accepted the archbishop's tendency to identify the Christian church with its clergy and to assert clerical independence from any secular power below the monarch. Although admitting that both the Babylonian and Jerusalem <span class="roman">Talmuds</span> contained fables and follies (especially about Jesus and the Virgin Mary), Selden gave them the sceptical, critical reading already practised on the sources used in his earlier histories. Carefully interpreted, the traditional wisdom, judicial decisions, and modes of scriptural exegesis that had accumulated from the days of Moses on Sinai to the diaspora and beyond provided the key for understanding the teachings and practices of the ancient Jews and early Christians.<br>
<br>The potentially more explosive of these two treatises was that on priestly succession, for it dealt with the sensitive issue of the divine origin of priesthood in 1636, when William Prynne published anonymously in Amsterdam his attack upon the biblical origins of episcopacy, <span class="italic">The Unbishoping of Timothy and Titus</span>. Selden noted how the customs and traditions of the Jews (like unwritten English common law) guided both the succession of the priests and their powers. Book 1 surveyed the history of the Jewish priesthood from Aaron to the destruction of the second temple, showing how high priests held sacred office through their lineage from Aaron. Book 2 explored the legal requirements of eligibility for ancient Jewish priesthood, and it also discussed priestly consecration, vestments, and sacrifices, and the differences between the first and second temples. Finally it portrayed priests as having authority in judgment and interpretation of law by virtue of their scholarly understanding of oral traditions, and the Great Sanhedrin as having the power to settle all such issues, including disputes over priestly succession. However, Selden did not fully define the membership of the Sanhedrin. Together these studies also carried into another historical setting his link between the binding laws of God and nature and the laws of particular societies, this time with the &#145;additions and enlargements&#146; of the ancient Jews.<h2>
<a name="RehabilitationandDejurenaturali"></a>Rehabilitation and De jure naturali</h2>During the 1630s Selden received recognition and expanded his social life into new circles, including the court. In November 1632 he was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple; he and Sir Edward Herbert were among representatives from the inns of court who staged the masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span> before the king and queen at the Banqueting House in February 1634 and again at the Merchant Taylors' Hall. As the court connections of the countess of Kent strengthened, Selden entered into a mentoring relationship with George Digby (the scholarly eldest son of the earl of Bristol), lending books, purchasing volumes, and enjoying his company. In February 1638 the courtier, connoisseur, and diplomat Sir Kenelm Digby wrote from Paris thanking Selden &#145;for the kind favour you did me in sending me your Mare Clausum and other workes&#146; and reciprocated with a book in a fine French binding  (Bodl. Oxf., Selden MS, supra 108, fol. 78<i>r</i>). Following the death of the earl of Kent in 1639 Selden took up permanent residence at White Friars, the home of the countess. There was clearly a widely circulating rumour that he married her, and the countess's description of herself in her will as &#145;late wife&#146; rather than as &#145;widow&#146; of Kent gives it some credence. John Aubrey asserted it as a truth, adding that Selden had had sexual relations with her during Kent's lifetime and with his knowledge; Selden inherited the countess's property after her death.<br>
<br>In his weighty treatise <span class="italic">De jure naturali et gentium, juxta disciplinam Ebrorum</span> (1640) Selden built upon both Grotius and rabbinic traditions, reducing the minimal moral duties of humans to seven laws imposed by God first upon Adam and later upon Noah and his descendants. He listed these as &#145;the prohibitions of idolatry and blasphemy, the injunction to establish a legal system, commandments against bloodshed, sexual sins, and theft, and a seventh law &hellip; added after the flood &hellip; forbidding anyone to eat flesh cut from a living animal&#146;  (Rosenblatt, 126). For an early seventeenth-century European they also provided the earliest possible starting point for discussion because these laws were &#145;given to the human race at its very creation&#146; and &#145;revealed and made manifest, like principles or theorems in demonstrative matters, to every man whose mind was not depraved, who was not corrupted, and who intuited rightly and diligently enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">De jure naturali</span>, 109, as translated in Sommerville, 440). By invoking divine sanction, Selden clearly abandoned the move by Grotius to use only basic principles based upon human relationships.<br>
<br>Selden probably found the position of Grotius too vulnerable to sceptical subversion and used a story from Herodotus to argue &#145;that there were clearly no common principles of morality accessible to all men by the light of their natural reason&#146;  (Tuck, <span class="italic">Philosophy and Government</span>, 215). Earlier he had argued that each society limited the law of nature in its own way owing to particular context and to the diversity of opinion which arose from the weakness of human reason, and each had its unique <i>nomos</i>, the different &#145;state&#146; or &#145;frame of government&#146; that reflected and upheld its social arrangements. By 1640, however, unaided human reason and custom no longer fully satisfied Selden. The commands of God, continually upheld by an &#145;active intellect&#146; through which the human mind perceived the truth, now provided a firmer foundation for natural law. Although most of Noah's descendants had to some extent lost sight of the original principles, the descendants of Schem and particularly the Jews remained especially open to the active intellect and best preserved them. This guaranteed that the rabbinic account of natural law stood closer to God's original commands than the fallible human traditions of other societies. The additions and enlargements of the laws of nature spelled out in the &#145;civil laws&#146; of each society also stood rooted in another divine command: &#145;<i>You must abide by contracts and forms of government agreed on by the citizens, and you must keep your word</i> or some such decree&#146;  (<span class="italic">De jure naturali</span>, 107, as translated in Tuck, <span class="italic">Philosophy and Government</span>, 216&#150;17). The honouring of &#145;contracts&#146; and &#145;frames of government&#146; remained fundamental to social and political life, as in the second edition of <span class="italic">Titles of Honor</span> and <span class="italic">Mare clausum</span>. Although the first book of <span class="italic">De jure naturali</span> addressed general issues, the succeeding ones dealt with one (or two) of the Noachide laws, exhausting the meaning and implications of each with a plenitude of detail. Combining theory with historical evidence, Selden provided a divine sanction for the polity and laws of nations from the ancient Jews to early modern Europeans. This search for the expression of God's commands in human customs and jurisprudence characterized most of his future works.<h2>
<a name="The1640spublicofficesocialcircleandthehistoryofthechurch"></a>The 1640s: public office, social circle, and the history of the church</h2>In the 1640s Selden served as a member of the Long Parliament (until excluded by Pride's Purge), acted as a lay member of the Westminster assembly, and continued extensive scholarly research and writing. His election as MP for Oxford University perhaps had the blessing of its chancellor, Laud, who tried to enlist Selden's help to relieve pressure for extensive religious reform by withdrawing the canons of 1640. Selden sat on fewer committees, spoke only infrequently in debates, and swayed the Commons far less often than in 1628&#150;9. On 10 March 1641 he argued that since &#145;ancientlie Bishops in Saxon times had voices in making lawes&#146; before voting for removal of clerical participation &#145;wee would give the clergie some other voices&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Journal of Sir Simonds D'Ewes</span>, ed. W. Notestein, 1923, 468 and n. 10). Against his advice the house initiated a bill to remove the bishops from parliament. For Selden this represented a serious subversion of the English &#145;frame of government&#146;. A few months later he also spoke and voted against the attainder of Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford.<br>
<br>When Charles I began to gather supporters in the summer of 1642 the marquess of Hertford invited Selden to join him in royal service in York. In reply, Selden excused himself on grounds of illness, but also professed that his &#145;loyal and humble affections to his majestie and his service are and shall now be as great and as hearty as any mans&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Selden MS supra 123, fol. 159<i>r</i>). Ironically, his theory of mixed monarchy formed the basis for <span class="italic">His Majesties Answer to the XIX Propositions</span> (1642). Selden collected printed material on the royal commissions of array and drafted a treatise debating whether such commissions were &#145;warrantable&#146; by the common law and statute  (Bodl. Oxf., Selden MS supra 124, fol. 1). An examination of the history of raising troops in England, especially &#145;knights service&#146; concluded that &#145;the obligations that are made by homage and fealty are such as bind only in honor or conscience, but [subject] the party not to any punishment at the common law&#146;  (supra 124, 14&#150;15). The military actions of royal servants had to be &#145;warranted by immemorial Custome or by act of Parlament, and not at all by arguments drawn simply from mischeif or convenience or inconvenience&#146;, or else they would violate the ancient &#145;frame of government&#146; of England  (supra 124, p. 18). Commissions of array had no foundation in custom or statute. Drawing upon many of his arguments from the debates over the militia in the session of 1628, he showed that mixed monarchy could defend the parliamentary as well as the royalist cause.<br>
<br>Some of Selden's scholarship in the 1640s offered advice less hidden than most of his earlier works. His translation from Arabic into Latin of the early section of a history of the Christian church in Alexandria, <span class="italic">Eutychii Aegyptii, patriarchae orthodoxorum Alexandrini</span> (1642), portrayed its author, Eutychius (877&#150;940), as the Egyptian Bede, a reliable historian of his own people, and related how the evangelist Mark chose a shoemaker, Hananias, as the first patriarch of the city and established a council of twelve presbyters to choose and consecrate his successor from among their number. This ancient &#145;frame of government&#146; for one of the earliest Christian churches was not unlike the modified episcopacy advocated by Archbishop Ussher and spoke to the arguments over divine-right episcopacy and presbyterianism that had started to rage openly in London in 1641. Eutychius charted the rise of bishops within the Alexandrine church, intruding themselves between the patriarch and the other clergy, and the loss by presbyters of their exclusive privilege of electing and ordaining the patriarch. In his commentary Selden used his understanding of ancient Jewish practices to shed light on the ecclesiastical offices mentioned in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and other early Christian sources. The consecration of especially studious Jews as &#145;presbyters&#146; and the laying on of hands that initiated the most learned of them into the Great Sanhedrin indicated that the early Christianity portrayed by Eutychius had Jewish roots. Another section of his commentary attempted to find a middle way through the equally contentious issue of extemporaneous versus fixed or liturgical prayer sparked off by attacks upon the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in the early 1640s. Clearly he wanted the reforms of the present to incorporate the good practices of the past, a difficult position during an age of accelerated reformation.<br>
<br>From July 1643 onwards Selden participated in the often heated debates of the Westminster assembly, appointed by parliament to reform the Church of England. The vast majority of members were ordained clergy who strongly desired reforms in ecclesiastical governance, worship, and discipline, and a codification of doctrine. Many found it difficult to deal with a layman who questioned their readings of scripture and displayed greater expertise on a variety of issues than any of the clergy. Selden's best-known and, for the Scots, most vexing contributions came during the debates over excommunication. Robert Baillie, one of the Scottish clerical commissioners, characterized him as &#145;the head of the Erastians; his glory is most in the Jewish learning; he avows everywhere that the Jewish State and Church were all one, and that so in England it must be, that the Parliament is the Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 2.266). This downplayed Selden's deep knowledge and use of British history, including that of the church, but accurately summarized his interpretation. On 4 January 1644, when a committee report suggested that pastors and teachers had &#145;the power to inquire and judge who are fit to be admitted to the sacraments, or be kept from them; and also who are to be excommunicated or absolved from that censure&#146;, Selden responded by suggesting:<blockquote>that, in this kingdom, ever since it was a kingdom, Christian excommunication hath ever been by a temporal power; as in the Pope's rule here, his own excommunication could not be brought in hither, but by permission of the secular power. (<span class="italic">Whole Works of &hellip; Lightfoot</span>, 13.106)</blockquote>In other debates he applied his rabbinic learning against compulsive readings of <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 5: 4 and <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 18: 15&#150;17 favoured by the presbyterians. These clashes led to sharp rejoinders around Selden's table: &#145;presbiters have the greatest power of any Clergie in the World, and gull the Laytie the most&#146;  (Selden, <span class="italic">Table Talk</span>, 113). While unsuccessful in persuading a majority of the divines in the Westminster assembly, Selden and other lay delegates did persuade parliament to adopt more flexible policies on governance and excommunication than those supported by the presbyterians.<br>
<br>Collected mostly in the 1640s by his clerical amanuensis, Richard Milward, and published posthumously in 1689 with a dedication to his executors, Selden's &#145;table talk&#146; reflected his concerns from this decade. Its contents, arranged alphabetically in short sections, were devoted mainly to issues of religion, morality, and politics. That on translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> demonstrated both his feeling of scholarly community and his common sense. In translating from French to English, he observed, one did not translate word for word but phrase by phrase: &#145;I say it is cold, not, it makes cold&#146;; in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, however, &#145;the Hebraisms are kept &hellip; which is well enough so long as scholars have to do with it; but when it comes among the common people, Lord, what gear do they make of it&#146;  (Selden, <span class="italic">Table Talk</span>, 6&#150;7). He was not afraid to make fun of the clergy, but considered that the bishops had the same right to sit in the Lords as did the peerage, namely that of precedent. As in the common law, custom ruled. The section headed &#145;Jewes&#146; summed up succinctly the basic interpretation put forward in his weighty Judaic studies:<blockquote>God att the first gave laws to all Mankind, but afterwards hee gave peculiar laws, to the Jewes which they only were to observe, Just as we have the Comon Law for all England, and yet ye have some Corporations, that besides that, have peculier lawes and priviledges to themselves. (ibid., 54)</blockquote>This made the jurisprudence of the Jews look like the &#145;civil laws&#146; of other societies, without the upholding power of the active intellect posited in <span class="italic">De jure naturali</span>. Glimpses of Selden's sardonic wit appeared occasionally in his published works and between the lines of letters from his correspondents, but characterized much of the conversational tone recorded by Milward, as seen in his account of the &#145;person of quality&#146; who arrived at his chambers &#145;and told me he had two devils in his head (I wondered what he meant)&#146;  (ibid., 46).<br>
<br>During the 1640s Selden also received a number of rewards, made new friendships, and helped old friends. Parliament appointed him keeper of the records in the Tower in 1643 and named him one of the twelve commissioners for the Admiralty in 1644. In 1646 he was voted &pound;5000 in compensation for his prosecution and imprisonment by the crown in 1629&#150;31, but found it difficult to collect. He used his influence to save several libraries from pillage and disbursal, including the royal collection, that at Lambeth Palace, and that of Archbishop Ussher. He received wonderful letters of praise, such as that in 1647 from young Ralph Cudworth, the future Cambridge Platonist, accompanied by a &#145;pamphlet&#146; on religion, a &#145;small expression of my great Respects to you&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Selden MS supra 108, fol. 1<i>r</i>). Other younger scholars, such as the very learned Dr Gerard Langbaine, provost of Queen's College, Oxford, sought Selden's protection from over-zealous visitors in 1648. Working in Westminster, he helped many caught up in the tribulations of the civil wars.<h2>
<a name="Jewishandlegalpublications16441655"></a>Jewish and legal publications, 1644&#150;1655</h2>Selden's Jewish studies flourished in the 1640s and 1650s, spurred on by contemporary debates. Building upon his earlier interest in chronology, he published <span class="italic">De anno civili et calendario veteris ecclesiae seu reipublicae Judaicae, dissertatio</span> (1644). The reconciliation of the lunar and the solar years shaped the rituals and annual festivals of the Jews (and, through them, those of Christians), but Selden called it a &#145;civil&#146; calendar because the application of the law of God in a workable manner was a human responsibility. The preface argued that Jewish traditions of interpretation could help Christians better to understand passages in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. A dialogical approach shaped much of the text, with Selden detailing the &#145;Talmudic and Scripturalist&#146; interpretations of chronology as it related to a wide range of activity. The latter belonged to the Karaites, who traced their heritage back to the Sadducees, but derived from Anan ben David, who lived in the middle of the eighth century; &#145;Selden may be regarded as the first modern western scholar, Jew or gentile, to analyse the practices of this Jewish sect&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Selden on Jewish Marriage law: the Uxor Hebraica</span>, trans. J. R. Ziskind, 1991, 16). Instead of determining the new moon that marked the beginning of the month for the Jewish lunar calendar by mathematical calculation, the Karaites used visual observation. This could make the crucial difference of a day for the start of rituals. Although portraying the Karaites as having the deepest understanding of lunar time, Selden also saw Talmudic scholars as providing the foundations of the ordinary traditions of interpretation upon which even the Karaites had to rely. With their dialogical approach, great variety of voices and schools, and zeal for the word of God, Jewish scholars had become for Selden, perhaps ironically, the best model for Christians to move beyond their factional conflicts.<br>
<br>Selden's <span class="italic">Uxor Ebraica</span> (1646), written by the early 1640s, provided the scholarly basis for many of the interpretations in the controversial tract by John Milton, <span class="italic">The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span> (1643). Selden's 622-page treatise exhaustively examined the nature of marriage and divorce as discussed in the <span class="roman">Torah</span>, the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>, and commentaries of a host of Jewish scholars. Book 1 opened by noting that while the &#145;civil laws&#146; of other societies came from natural law (the Noachide laws), the &#145;civil law&#146; of the Hebrews was &#145;partly Sacred Law&#146; commanded in the <span class="roman">Torah</span> &#145;and partly ancestral custom and sanctions added by those who were in charge of such matters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Uxor Ebraica</span>, 33). It then discussed unions forbidden on the grounds of consanguinity and affinity, the Karaites, the marriages of high priests and kings, and the practice of polygamy (including that of Muslims). Book 2 dealt largely with betrothal, dowry, and marriage ceremonies among the Jews and gentiles, including the ancient Romans. After showing how Jewish and pagan customs of betrothal and marriage &#145;passed into Christianity&#146;, Selden turned to the practices of Greek and Latin Christians, and then to those in England, including the medieval ceremony of the Salisbury rite and the reformed one of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. This led to the conclusion that Christian and Jewish marriage customs, while &#145;not often exactly the same&#146; were &#145;analogous and similar&#146;  (p. 284).<br>
<br>Book 3 dealt with the nature of marriage and divorce. Jewish marriage involved mutual obligations between husband and wife, including the &#145;conjugal obligation&#146; of regular sexual intercourse; these obligations provided a framework for judging its failure. Through careful philological comparison of key texts in <span class="roman">New Testament</span> Greek with the Aramaic of the rabbinic schools' teachings on the Deuteronomic grounds for divorce, Selden finally concluded that while Jesus's teachings initially seemed within the school of Shammai, which permitted divorce only for fornication, they were actually not very far from the permissiveness of the school of Hillel which allowed it for any reasonable cause. Natural law allowed spouses to marry and divorce &#145;by mutual consent&#146;, and this position shaped the interpretations of Jewish rabbis, the early Christians, and Greek and Russian Christians. Only the highly restrictive teachings and canon laws of western Christians were portrayed as unusual and unprecedented. An open-minded reader, Selden concluded, would know what changes to make to the English law of divorce. Although less directly, this political advice advocated reforms not unlike those already proclaimed by Milton.<br>
<br>In the 1640s Selden also revisited his earlier passion for the history of law in Europe, writing an introduction for his edition of <span class="italic">Fleta</span> (1647), an early treatise on English law from the reign of Edward I. Though badly printed, as he himself appreciated, it spelt out with greater subtlety and detail the history of the Roman law after the collapse of the empire in the West and of its interaction with the English common law briefly sketched in the &#145;Review&#146; at the end of the <span class="italic">Historie of Tithes</span>. After providing an account of the usage and study of the Theodosian and Justinian codes in western and southern Europe from the fall of the Roman empire to the revival of learning in the twelfth century, Selden turned to Britain. The &#145;Anglo-Saxon invaders of England&#146; used &#145;only their native Germanic customs&#146; the &#145;laws of the Mercians, of the East Saxons and later of the Danes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Joannis Seldeni ad Fletam dissertatio</span>, trans. D. Ogg, 1925, 105). As in other parts of Europe, the Roman law reappeared in Britain in the twelfth century when &#145;the two Codes were introduced into England together in order that the most complete manuals of the Roman law extant in Latin might be available&#146;  (ibid., 109).<br>
<br>Under the early Normans the study of &#145;old English customs and laws as affecting public administration&#146; by the learned monks of Abingdon helped to preserve them  (<span class="italic">Joannis Seldeni ad Fletam dissertatio</span>, trans. D. Ogg, 1925, 129). This remained the law of the land, although &#145;archbishops and bishops who had studied civil and canon law as well as English law were frequently appointed His Majesty's judges and exercised full jurisdiction&#146;  (ibid., 143). These clerics helped to spread knowledge of the Roman and canon laws, and encouraged lawyers to use &#145;the very words and maxims of the civil law&#146; in their &#145;pleadings before the king's judges&#146;  (ibid., 149), partly explaining the familiarity and use of the Roman law &#145;by Bracton, Thornton and the author of <span class="italic">Fleta</span> and in the Year Books of Edward II&#146;, but this expertise did not continue into the reign of Edward III  (ibid., 159). Although many English lawyers and experts made use of Roman law &#145;in their studies, writings and debates&#146; during the period from Stephen to Edward III, it did not become the law of the land, because of &#145;the unconcealed aversion which our ancestors had to&#146; Roman law and &#145;the remarkable esteem in which the English or common law was held&#146;  (ibid., 161, 165). This history served both to introduce the reader to <span class="italic">Fleta</span> (which Selden discussed at some length at the end of this essay) and, perhaps more importantly, to inoculate England against any universalist claims of Roman or civil lawyers, one of the aims of so many of his earlier histories.<br>
<br>The last and most detailed of Selden's Judaic studies, <span class="italic">De synedriis et praefecturis juridicis veterum Ebraeorum</span> (1650&#150;55), dealt with the ruling assembly, the Great Sanhedrin, and other judicial bodies of the ancient Hebrews. The last volume appeared posthumously and unfinished; all three together extended to 1841 pages in the edition of 1655. Although Selden had begun to research this topic during the 1630s, the pressures and debates of the following decade added relevance to the project. With its portrayal of the integration of the sacred and secular in ancient Jewish society, <span class="italic">De synedriis</span> may well have offered an indirect plea for England to return to a mixed government in which clergy sat in parliament. Jewish practices provided patterns not only for the early Christians, but for more recent reformers, as Selden had argued more than once in the Westminster assembly. The power of excommunication claimed by divine right by Roman Catholics, episcopalians, and presbyterians came under extended scrutiny in <span class="italic">De synedriis</span> and was attributed to human invention. The overarching power that resided in the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem provided Selden with the key for understanding the allusive and tantalizing <span class="roman">New Testament</span> texts upon which the Latin church had erected its claims for spiritual jurisdiction and its elaborate system of church courts. Containing both lawyers or teachers and priests learned in the law, the Great Sanhedrin handled both spiritual and secular questions and helped to maintain stability in ancient Jewish society.<br>
<br>The first volume of <span class="italic">De synedriis</span> dealt largely with the issue and history of excommunication. Among the ancient Jews and early Christians, it was exercised by magistrates, while priests, clergy, and lay teachers (rabbis) who dealt with spiritual matters did not exercise penal jurisdiction <i>ex officio</i> but only in their capacity as men wise in the law invited or elected to the civil task of judgment. Among the Jews, sinners excommunicated for breaking the law continued to participate in the whole range of ritual activities, even teaching, unless they also had some ritual uncleanness. Among the early Christians, the image of the spiritual sword (&#145;gladium spiritalem&#146;) did not represent some independent coercive jurisdiction, but acted as a metaphor for the duties of preaching, praying, teaching, and administering the sacraments  (vol. 1, p. 271). Only under the emperor Constantine did Christian clergy briefly act as judges.<br>
<br>The second volume concentrated upon the institutions of justice, where they derived their power, and who made up their membership, including the qualities of members of the Great Sanhedrin. It included a section on the qualifications of Jewish &#145;presbyters&#146; and how they received their authority and ordination by human law, not divine right. The third volume dealt with the overarching power of the Great Sanhedrin, how it decided such unpriestly issues as war and peace, distinguished between prophets and pseudo-prophets, and supported and oversaw the high priest. With all its complexities and lengthy asides, this great work again showed that for Selden, political advice derived both from laws commanded by God and from the experience of humans in interpreting them. Jewish rabbis remained his most privileged interpreters and offered much wisdom to those Christians prepared to master their writings and style of exegesis.<h2>
<a name="Lastmonthsandlegacy"></a>Last months and legacy</h2>As he neared the end of his seventh decade Selden's precarious health declined. His long-time companion, the countess of Kent, died on 7 December 1651 and left him her property. Two years later he updated his will, appointing his &#145;beloved friends&#146; Edward Heyward, John Vaughan, Matthew Hale, and Rowland Jewks the elder, as the heirs in trust of his lands and estate, and leaving only &pound;100 each to the two sons of his sister, Mary, and her husband, John Bernard of Goring, Sussex, as country folk unused to riches; Aubrey thought he had at least one illegitimate daughter, but had considered such offspring unworthy heirs. Among many minor legatees were William Seymour, marquess of Hertford, &#145;Mr Grey Longueville&#146;, and Sir Thomas Cotton. Continuing to correspond with friends and scholars, Selden answered in October 1653 an enquiry from Archbishop Ussher about the identity of Gallio in the book of <span class="roman">Acts</span>, concluding&#151;after examining works by Caesar Baronius, Grotius, and Justus Lipsius&#151;that he may well have been Seneca's brother. By this time he was ill&#151;&#145;of a dropsey&#146;, according to Aubrey  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 274). In November 1654 he conversed with Ussher and Langbaine, which supports Anthony Wood's repetition of Sir Matthew Hale's comment that he died &#145;a resolved serious Christian&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 1813&#150;20, 3.376), rather than Aubrey's story that Thomas Hobbes persuaded Selden to turn away clergymen who came to pray with him. Following Selden's death at White Friars on 30 November, the aged archbishop of Armagh preached on 14 December at Selden's well-attended public funeral at the Temple Church; he was buried in the Temple Church on the same day.<br>
<br>During a lifetime of scholarship, legal practice, and public service, Selden amassed an extensive collection of books and manuscripts. A story circulated that he had revoked an original intention to bequeath these to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, but this was false. By the terms of his will the library was to receive his collection of Greek and Oriental manuscripts, selected Latin manuscripts, and his remaining Talmudic and rabbinical books. Most of these were forwarded by his executors to the Bodleian in 1659, although in the interim some had been lost. Among the 8000 volumes which arrived safely, some had belonged to Jonson, Donne, and Cotton; they remain there today. Selden's greatest legacy, however, was not the expensive hat band studded with diamonds that he left to Hertford but his extensive European and Jewish studies and his advocacy of a mixed monarchy. His histories on European and British topics displayed a meticulous application of continental humanist methods and a masterful reading of English and continental sources and commentaries in imaginative, detailed narratives of great complexity. The meticulous results of his plunge into the complex realm of Jewish studies showed great respect for the integrity of rabbinic interpretations and an unparalleled understanding of Jewish texts, traditions, and history, all conveyed in subtle, empathetic studies that used the wisdom of the Jews to teach a Christian audience. How fitting for one praised by the earl of Clarendon for &#145;his good nature, charity, and delight in doing good&#146;  (Clarendon, 1.31) and noted by Wood as &#145;the glory of the English nation, as Hugo Grotius worthily stiles him&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 1813&#150;20, 3.366). His contribution to scholarship was commemorated through the giving of his name to the Selden Society, founded to publish the significant documents of English legal history; volumes have appeared regularly since 1888.<br>
