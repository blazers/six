<span class="headword">Anstruther, Sir  Robert</span>  (1578&#150;1644/5?), <span class="occ">diplomat and politician</span>, was the second son of Sir James Anstruther (<i>d</i>. 1606), fiar of Anstruther, and Jean Scott of Abbotshall. His birth in Anstruther Wester, Fife, was recorded by his father on 23 April 1578. A graduate of St Salvator's College, at the University of St Andrews, Anstruther was partly educated at the Danish court, where he served as a page from 1598. In 1603 he carried falcons to Scotland as a gift from Christian IV to James VI. From 1606 Anstruther served in Danish service as an agent of the Stuart court&#151;he is mentioned in 1612 as <i>famulis communis</i> of the two kings. In 1612&#150;13 he mediated the Kn&auml;red peace treaty between the Scandinavian countries with his grandfather's stepson, Sir James Spens of Wormiston. It was for this service that he received his knighthood, although from which king (Stuart or Oldenburg) is not clear. Early in 1614 James VI and I had been asked by Christian IV to arbitrate in his dispute with the city of L&uuml;beck. During his embassy in 1615 Anstruther continued the mediation begun promisingly by Sir Andrew Sinclair, and once more proved influential in resolving Christian's disputes peacefully. On 22 April 1617 he married Mary Swift, daughter of Sir Robert Swift, of Doncaster, Yorkshire, with whom he had three sons, Robert (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>. 1629), Philip (<i>d</i>. 1702), and Christian (who died in infancy), and two daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah (<i>bap</i>. 1644).<br>
<br>When tensions in Bohemia flared in 1618 Anstruther travelled to Denmark and Germany as the main negotiator of James VI and I. Peace proving elusive, he returned to Denmark in April 1620 to raise money for the elector palatine's cause. Christian IV was so pleased with him that on one celebrated evening he resigned to him the Danish crown, with which Anstruther was invested for the duration of the feast. On a business level Anstruther negotiated with Christian for a loan of &pound;100,000, and by 1621 this sum was costing King James &pound;6000 per annum in interest payments alone. That same year Anstruther travelled to the United Provinces to give Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia &pound;20,000 compensation for her lost household goods. He also spoke to the states council seeking arms for a military campaign in Bohemia. James also sent Anstruther to the Segeberg conference to seek a military alliance between Denmark&#150;Norway, Great Britain, and the United Provinces, a mission which resulted in the Hague alliance of November 1621.<br>
<br>The following year Anstruther, now mentioned as a gentleman of the privy chamber of King James, could be found in the English parliament translating the speech of the imperial ambassador, Count Schwarzenberg, for King James. After many more rounds of discussion, in 1624 Anstruther set out to negotiate with Christian IV, Gustavus Adolphus, John George of Saxony, and the Lower Saxon circle. By February 1625 Swedish plans were rejected and James accepted Christian IV's terms. Anstruther continued as ambassador to Denmark&#150;Norway after the coronation of Charles I. He delivered &pound;46,000 to Christian IV in June 1625 and included the first of his embassies to the Holy Roman emperor, Ferdinand II, between September and October 1625. This embassy also included a visit to the palatine court at The Hague. He thereafter undertook continual diplomatic missions in Denmark&#150;Norway, Sweden, and Germany between 1625 and 1629. After the treaty of L&uuml;beck in 1629 he left Christian IV's court and travelled to Hamburg from where he conducted much of his remaining &#145;Danish&#146; residency, writing to Sir Thomas Roe the following spring that unless directed by Charles I or personally summoned by Christian IV he had no intention of visiting the Danish king. Yet Anstruther would not tolerate any slander of Christian IV. Roe sought to discredit Christian owing to the L&uuml;beck agreement with Ferdinand II, but Anstruther steadfastly defended Christian's integrity. None the less, Charles I felt it was time for Anstruther to undertake new missions.<br>
<br>In August 1630 Anstruther set out to the diet of Regensburg. Ferdinand II received Anstruther with &#145;great honour and courtesy&#146; though ultimately, the diet dissolved in November, achieving little. Anstruther related to Roe the futility of the diet, which he described as an exercise in protecting electoral dignity. Despite his reluctance he returned to the imperial diet, now relocated to Vienna, where he gained another audience with Ferdinand II, on 15 June 1631. He found that the negotiating parties approached the diet from such opposing positions that he could see little scope for solutions. Anstruther returned to his Scandinavian duties, arguing that to remain would be detrimental to the house of Stuart.<br>
<br>In December 1631 an agent of the duke of Bavaria arrived in London accusing Anstruther of being a &#145;violent partisan&#146; of the king of Sweden and for that reason not suitable to enjoy any intimacy at the imperial court. Anstruther returned to London where he convinced Charles I of Ferdinand II's false intentions. On hearing Anstruther's account Charles declared that &#145;he would to God he was served thus by all his ministers&#146;. After visiting London, Anstruther returned to Hamburg, <i>en route</i> visiting The Hague to discuss new proposals offered by Charles I. These centred on trying to get the duke of Bavaria elected as Holy Roman emperor, which would have separated him from the Austrian camp. Undaunted by Dutch reservations Anstruther attended the diet of allied princes at Heilbronn, where he revealed his instructions to offer up to &pound;10,000 per month to the new alliance. He also travelled several times to the Danish court. Despite the disastrous recent visit of the earl of Leicester, Anstruther managed to bring the Danes closer to the Stuart position than they had been since L&uuml;beck. He continued pressing for ratification of the disputed Hague treaty of 1625, and Christian IV eventually conceded the need for a new confederacy. Anstruther travelled to the diet of protestant princes in 1633 accompanied by the Scottish cleric John Durie. He continued to negotiate in Germany until April 1635 during which time he joined the intellectual German society Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft, where he was given the name Der Fleissige (the diligent) for his diplomatic endeavours in Europe. But European diplomacy frequently fell behind events. By 1634 most of the Palatinate had been occupied by the French, which placed pressure on Ferdinand II to find solutions to his growing problems in Germany. Any glimmer of hope for Anstruther's negotiations was upset by the peace of Prague in 1635, which undermined Stuart credibility in Germany.<br>
<br>In 1638 it was decided to resolve finally differences between Christian IV and Charles I. These talks were scheduled to take place in Hamburg. Anstruther was again selected to represent Great Britain, though he turned the appointment down. His refusal to accept the appointment perhaps centred on political developments in Scotland; indeed, one of the rare mentions of Anstruther as a Scot in diplomatic dispatches appeared in April 1638 in a letter largely concerned with the background and progress of the Scottish covenanting movement. By May an unfounded rumour circulated that Anstruther had been dismissed rather than having stood down himself. Whatever his motivation, Anstruther declined the mission and Roe was appointed instead. Anstruther correctly predicted that the negotiations would come to naught and, as Roe found to his cost, negotiating for the Stuarts could prove both futile and frustrating. None the less, in 1641 Anstruther returned to Denmark to negotiate for the house of Stuart and in 1644 acted as the Danish envoy both to Charles I and to the English parliament. That he did so is interesting, not least as he was a signatory to the solemn league and covenant in 1643.<br>
<br>In a letter to Henry Vane of 31 May 1634 Anstruther indicated that he was then in his fifty-sixth year. Two years later he purchased the estate of Wheatley, Doncaster, which had previously been in the possession of his brother-in-law, Barnham Swift, Viscount Carlingford. When Anstruther died, probably in 1644 or 1645, after a lifetime as one of the Stuarts' most important diplomats, his eldest son, Robert, succeeded to Wheatley while Philip succeeded his uncle in his Scottish estates in Fife. Philip was knighted by Charles II at Scone and was eventually captured at the battle of Worcester.<br>
