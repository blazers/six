<span class="headword">O'Moran,  James</span>  (1735&#150;1794), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service</span>, was born and baptized on 1 May 1735 in the parish of Ross, near Elphin, co. Roscommon, Ireland, allegedly the son of a shoemaker. He was educated at the Irish College at Tournai, Belgium, of which his uncle was rector. On 15 November 1752 he entered the Dillon infantry regiment of the Franco-Irish brigade as a cadet, and was commissioned <i>lieutenant en second</i> on 14 January 1759. He served with distinction in the campaigns of 1760&#150;61 in Germany. Although without wealth or obvious influence he was steadily promoted and received the cross of St Louis in 1778. In 1779 he crossed the Atlantic with his regiment to serve at the capture of Grenada and in D'Estaing's subsequent naval victory over the English. His regiment joined the Americans at the siege of Savannah, during which he suffered a leg wound which troubled him for the rest of his life. After recuperating in France he returned to America in 1780 and participated in an expedition to Jamaica in 1782. He became a member of the Society of the Cincinnati in 1783 and was awarded a pension on his return to France. In 1785 he married Patience Singleton (<i>d</i>. 1785), who died within months of their marriage. He later married Eleanor King (<i>b</i>. 1760), a native of Scotland; they had two children, Eleanor (<i>b</i>. 1788) and William (<i>b</i>. 1789).<br>
<br>Unlike many compatriots, O'Moran accepted the French Revolution and on 25 August 1791 he was appointed colonel of the regiment of Dillon, by then the 87th regiment. He was made <i>mar&eacute;chal de camp</i> on 6 February 1792. He served under Dumouriez in Champagne and Belgium and was promoted general of division on 3 October. His headquarters, which was at Tournai, he governed with prudence and firmness. While there he was a witness at the wedding of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the Irish radical, to Pamela, the adopted daughter of the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans. After Dumouriez's retreat from Belgium and subsequent treason O'Moran came under suspicion. He was removed from command and arrested in 1793. Arraigned before the revolutionary tribunal in Paris, he strongly maintained his innocence but was guillotined there on 6 March 1794. The night before his trial he wrote of his stainless, unbroken service to France and of his cherished dream of liberating Ireland. The latter ideal was probably rooted in his Irish brigade background, but was refined by his experience of the American and French revolutions. A brave and able soldier, O'Moran was noted for his fine manners, bonhomie, and Catholic faith. His son, William O'Moran, served in Napoleon's Irish legion.<br>
