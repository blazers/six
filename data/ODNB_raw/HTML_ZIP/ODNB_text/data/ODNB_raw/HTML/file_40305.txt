</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dollan, Sir  Patrick Joseph</span>  (1885&#150;1963), <span class="occ">journalist and local politician</span>, was born in Baillieston, Lanarkshire, on 3 April 1885. He was one of thirteen children of James Dollan, a miner, and his wife, Jane Rooney (<i>c</i>.1861&#150;<i>c</i>.1946), who were both of Irish descent. Baillieston was a mining village, incorporated into Glasgow in 1975. Dollan's memories were of &#145;an independent and tough community&#146;, and he stressed his parents' indomitability, despite considerable hardship. His mother at one time ran a grocery store. In later years he made much of his childhood, to demonstrate how far working-class Roman Catholics from an Irish immigrant background could succeed in public life.<br>
<br>The family's fortunes improved when Dollan's father was promoted to a supervisory position at the Clydeside colliery. Nevertheless, Dollan was obliged to leave St Bridget's elementary school at the age of ten, and started part-time work in a rope-making factory. His first full-time employment was as an assistant in a Baillieston grocery store, an experience that he claimed taught him much about financial management. At the age of fifteen he joined his father as a miner in the Clydeside colliery, although with characteristic energy he also enrolled for three sessions of evening classes at Wellshot Academy, Shettleston. Here he developed a talent for writing, winning literature prizes, and finding publishers for his essays. Adopting the pseudonym of Myner Collier he made his first forays into professional journalism for the Glasgow <span class="italic">Evening Times</span>, writing on mining topics.<br>
<br>Dollan became active in the labour movement during the early 1900s, serving as secretary to the newly inaugurated Baillieston branch of the Lanarkshire Miners' Union. Robert Smillie, a union official and Independent Labour Party (ILP) member, was an early and enduring influence. So too was John Wheatley, another prominent ILP figure, who like Dollan came from a Catholic Irish background. In 1910 Wheatley and Dollan set up a local ILP branch and, despite the strictures of the Catholic clergy against socialism, began to win recruits. Wheatley was impressed by Dollan's skills as a propagandist and was determined that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; should become a full-time journalist for <span class="italic">Forward</span>, a left-wing weekly Glasgow newspaper with a lively and trenchant style. Following a brief apprenticeship with Wheatley's own publishing firm, Dollan joined <span class="italic">Forward</span> in 1911 and became assistant editor. Although he long retained the <span class="italic">Forward</span> connection, he was later appointed the Scottish editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>.<br>
<br>On 20 September 1912 Dollan married Agnes Johnston Moir [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54395/', "Dollan, Agnes Johnston (1887&#150;1966)")</script>], a fellow ILP member and activist in the women's suffrage movement. She was not a Catholic, and the relationship was indicative of Dollan's drift from religious orthodoxy, although significantly both were later to become devout church members. In 1913 Dollan entered municipal politics, and remained a Glasgow corporation councillor until he retired in 1946. He represented the Govan Central ward, and claimed that he was initially the last-minute replacement for a candidate who had withdrawn, and that he had to be persuaded to stand by his friend John S. Taylor, Glasgow ILP organizer. Yet his writing for <span class="italic">Forward</span> revealed an enthusiastic interest in civic affairs. Effective government, he believed, originated at the community level, as citizens could relate more readily to their own home base. Dollan devoted himself to this ideal, and (apart from unsuccessfully contesting the Ayr burghs by-election in 1925) refused entreaties to embark on a parliamentary career.<br>
<br>From 1913 Dollan's commitment to community politics was demonstrated by his high profile on the housing issue, especially the Glasgow ILP campaign against excessive rent charges by private landlords. The demand for accommodation in the booming munitions districts after the outbreak of war intensified local protests, which took the form of rent strikes. These were notable for the pugnacious contribution of women and the role played by both Dollans in directing strategy. The events in Glasgow were decisive for the introduction of national legislation during 1915 to peg rent increases. However, Dollan did not confine his militancy to housing. He was an outspoken critic of the war, appearing on peace platforms and agitating against military conscription. In 1917 he served a prison sentence of 112 days' hard labour in London's Wormwood Scrubs for failing to comply with a directive to leave Glasgow and seek &#145;work of national importance&#146;. His resistance was given widespread press coverage, and added to the wartime rebel image of &#145;Red Clydeside&#146;.<br>
<br>The franchise reforms of 1918 opened out opportunities for the Labour Party in Glasgow and in the 1922 general election its candidates sensationally won ten out of the city's fifteen parliamentary seats. At the municipal level, despite a more restricted franchise, the Labour group also made substantial inroads, winning overall control of the corporation in 1933. Dollan was inextricably associated with these successes, his gift for organization making him a pivotal figure in the construction of Labour's expanding power base. The legend of Glasgow's electoral &#145;machine&#146; emerged at this time, a Labour juggernaut supposedly created by him, as he welded his extensive network of community connections together. Yet whatever the reality of Dollan and machine politics, Labour's forces were far from united in Glasgow, and the disaffiliation of the ILP from the party in 1932 created a crisis of allegiance. He was already disenchanted with the flamboyant individualism of ILP colleagues like James Maxton, and chose to remain within the Labour mainstream. However, a vacuum had emerged in organization because of the previous strength of ILP support in Scotland. He sought to redress the balance by forming the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) as a campaigning alternative to the ILP. The SSP could not establish a sufficiently distinctive identity and its status as a Labour affiliate ended in 1940, when it merged fully with the national party.<br>
<br>Dollan held a number of key municipal positions during the inter-war period, including the city treasurership, and deflected criticism of expenditure policies by ardently espousing the common good of Glasgow during the difficult depression years. His ability to cultivate the press was evident in the blaze of publicity surrounding his election as lord provost in 1938. Not only was he the first incumbent from a Catholic Irish background but he declared that he would be a working ambassador for the city, sparing no efforts to raise its international status. For all that he was aged fifty-three, with a shock of silver-grey hair, he consciously projected a youthful, energetic image and ensured that his wife also had a prominent public profile. At the outbreak of war in 1939 he directly appealed to the community spirit of Glaswegians, in a conflict that he claimed was for the defence of &#145;civic and national freedom&#146;. He went on to play a crucial co-ordinating role during the early phase of the war, when food and fuel shortages and the evacuation of children caused considerable social upheaval. For his war services he was knighted in 1941, towards the end of his three-year term as lord provost.<br>
<br>After his departure from civic politics, Dollan did not abandon public life, serving as chairman of East Kilbride New Town Development Corporation between 1947 and 1958. Other positions followed, including a directorship of British European Airways at a time when air transport was being nationalized. For some critics, his career path seemed to negate his early socialist commitment, and they found difficulty in coming to terms with his acceptance of a knighthood. However, as wartime lord provost Dollan was dedicated to destroying fascism and boosting Glaswegian morale, while the knighthood was perhaps the inevitable refinement to the image of the Dollans as a successful, stylish, and cultured couple. That both became associated with the right-wing Moral Re-Armament movement during the 1950s did nevertheless tarnish their reputation for progressivism. Dollan died in the Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow, on 30 January 1963 and was buried in Dalbeth cemetery on 1 February, acknowledged to be one of Glasgow's most astute and influential municipal politicians.<br>
