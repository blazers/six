<span class="headword">Yonge,  Philip</span>  (1709&#150;1783), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, was born at Lisbon, the son of Francis Yonge, who was commissary of the ordnance during the War of the Spanish Succession, and later agent in London for South Carolina. Educated at Westminster School from 1718, Yonge was admitted a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1728, elected a scholar in 1729, and proceeded BA in 1732, MA in 1735, and DD in 1750. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1734 and ordained deacon by the bishop of Lincoln in 1735. In 1746 he became public orator at Cambridge. In 1748 the master of Trinity, Dr Smith, urged the duke of Newcastle, as chancellor of the university, to support Yonge for the regius professorship of divinity, describing Yonge as &#145;a very amiable man, a true friend to the government, an excellent scholar of Westminster, and esteemed by us the greatest ornament of it&#146;  (Winstanley, 182). Newcastle declined to support him, and Yonge withdrew, thereby gaining Newcastle's favour by not being importunate. In 1748 Yonge became vicar of Barrington, Cambridgeshire, in 1750 vicar of Over, Cambridgeshire, and in 1752 rector of Loughton, Buckinghamshire, all on the presentation of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1750 he became a prebendary of Westminster Abbey but resigned in 1754 on receiving a canonry at St Paul's Cathedral, which he held until 1766. In 1757 the dean and chapter of St Paul's presented him to the rectory of Therfield, Hertfordshire, a living he resigned in 1761. On 15 December 1761 he married Anne, daughter of Calverley Bewicke, of Clapham, Surrey.<br>
<br>Yonge was active in Newcastle's interest in Cambridge. Probably owing to Newcastle's cordial relations with Sir Thomas Gooch, bishop of Ely, Gooch appointed Yonge to succeed Dr Ashton, a suspected Jacobite, as master of Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1752. Yonge also served as vice-chancellor of the university in 1752&#150;5. At Newcastle's behest he took an active part in raising &pound;3650 towards building the east front of the university library, going through college buttery books to identify anyone of distinction whom Newcastle might approach for a subscription. In 1757 Newcastle proposed Yonge as bishop of Peterborough, but was thwarted by George II. Nevertheless, in 1758 Yonge was appointed to the poorly endowed diocese of Bristol where he undertook a primary visitation in 1760. He was translated to the better-endowed diocese of Norwich in 1761.<br>
<br>As bishop of Norwich, Yonge continued to play an active part in university politics on Newcastle's behalf, managing the campaign in 1763 to elect Philip Yorke, second earl of Hardwicke, to succeed his father as high steward of the university. As a university politician Yonge combined great powers of detailed application with sound judgement. However, he was not servile in his support for Newcastle. He opposed Newcastle's initiative to nominate candidates for degrees granted by royal mandate, because this would endanger the independence and prestige of the university. He avoided voting in the Lords during the debate on John Wilkes's <span class="italic">An Essay on Woman</span>, which parodied <span class="italic">Veni Creator</span>. In reply to Newcastle's rebuke, Yonge pointed out that, on a matter of conscience, &#145;questions of friendship and attachment, of prudence, and of mere policy are &hellip; easily distinguishable from those which call upon every man to think for himself, and to consult his own heart&#146;  (Sykes, 55&#150;6). Yonge remained on friendly terms with Newcastle after he lost political power, and conducted Newcastle's funeral.<br>
<br>In Yonge's primary visitation charge at Norwich he exhorted his clergy to &#145;dwell among their flocks &hellip; administering God's word and sacrament &hellip; diligently and frequently&#146;, and to preach &#145;instructive and biblical sermons&#146;  (Yonge, <span class="italic">The Charge</span>). He also criticized &#145;field preaching&#146; and Methodism. Preaching in support of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital he strongly advocated medical care for the poor, and criticized the current poor law. He was reckoned to be &#145;one of the best preachers in the Establishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sylas Neville</span>, 175). He regularly spent every summer in his diocese, and undertook improvements to the palace. Parson Woodforde found his behaviour &#145;exceeding handsome and free&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of a Country Parson</span>, 150). However, his reputation later suffered from the opinion of his successor, Lewis Bagot, who complained of &#145;the easiness and inactivity of his predecessor&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.188). Yonge died on 23 April 1783 at Westminster, and was buried in the Grosvenor Chapel, Mayfair, on 1 May. His wife survived him.<br>
