<span class="headword">Hope,  Thomas</span>  (1769&#150;1831), <span class="occ">art collector and connoisseur</span>, was born in Amsterdam on 30 August 1769, the eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53264/', "John Hope (1737&#150;1784)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49405/', "Hope family (per. c.1700&#150;1813)")</script>] and his wife, Philippina Barbara van der Hoeven (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1789), daughter of Rotterdam's burgomaster. John Hope was a member of an immensely wealthy and prestigious family of Amsterdam merchants of Scottish descent, a partner in their highly successful firm, Hope &amp; Co., and a leading figure in Dutch politics and society.<br>
<br>In 1784, aged fifteen, Thomas Hope shared his father's fortune with his brothers Adrian Elias (<i>b</i>. 1772) and Henry Philip (1774&#150;1839), and seemed destined for leadership of Hope &amp; Co. In 1790, following his mother's death, he briefly worked as a partner in its counting-house, but he was never active in its management. Indeed it appears that at some stage his mother and others had turned him against the Hope partners. Instead he took up the study of classical architecture and civilization and from 1787, apart from short periods in Amsterdam, spent eight years travelling and studying architecture in countries bordering the Mediterranean. The austere simplicity of classicism impressed him greatly but he was also infused with the romanticism of Mediterranean culture; in Turkey, for example, he adopted local dress and abandoned his Christianity. His romantic novel, <span class="italic">Anastasius</span> (1819), first published in French but subsequently in thirteen editions and in four languages, was based on the experience of these travels. He published it anonymously and for a while it was thought to be the work of Lord Byron.<br>
<br>In 1795, at the time of the French occupation of Amsterdam, like most of his family, Hope settled in London, living in Duchess Street from 1799 and winning recognition as a scholar, collector, writer, proponent of neo-classicism, and enlightened patron of young and promising artists and craftsmen. He said of himself that he was entirely &#145;devoted to the arts&#146;  (Watkin, 13); above all else he sought to influence taste. To this end he employed, systematically, his immense fortune, intellect, and energy. All was done on a grand scale and with magnificence.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1806 Hope married a woman of modest means, Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1851), the beautiful daughter of William de la Poer Beresford, archbishop of Tuam and later first Baron Decies, and niece of the first marquess of Waterford. They had at least one daughter and four sons, the former and one of the latter predeceasing Thomas. Their youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13713/', "Alexander James Beresford Beresford Hope")</script>, became a notable politician and author. Louisa emerged as a glittering society hostess and their set came to include the prince and princess of Wales (later George IV and Queen Caroline), and the duke and duchess of Clarence (the future William IV and Queen Adelaide); Queen Adelaide appointed Mrs Hope a woman of the bedchamber. Thomas's preference was for the intellectual circles of exalted connoisseurship.<br>
<br>Hope was admitted to the Society of Dilettanti in 1800 and a year later received his first invitation to the annual dinner of the Royal Academy. Membership of the Royal Institution, the Royal Society, the Society of Arts, and the British Institution, and not least of their influential committees, followed as his reputation as an informed scholar grew. They provided him with a platform from which to influence taste and he was only held back by his widely acknowledged conceit, lack of tact, and unprepossessing appearance; he was described as ill-looking and effeminate in manner. He damaged his cause by openly lobbying the duke of Wellington, when prime minister, for a peerage.<br>
<br>Hope's concerns, according to his biographer Watkin, were with &#145;antique and modern art and with the attempt to influence the character of the latter by promoting knowledge of the former&#146;  (Watkin, 35). At the heart of his ambition was the wish to influence modern design through knowledge of the art of the ancients. Hope mastered the vast knowledge of classical art and architecture accumulated in the eighteenth century in order to interpret and publicize it. He did as much as anyone in England to promote neo-classicism but his interests were wider and more complex; he was equally a proponent of the English picturesque and linked both as valid components of a wider Romantic movement.<br>
<br>Hope had started to collect by 1795 when in Rome. Then, and on his many subsequent tours through southern Europe, he purchased sculpture, vases, and other antiquities. Most notably, he acquired in 1801 for &pound;4500 a magnificent collection of classical vases from Sir William Hamilton, and by 1806 he possessed over 1500 of the highest quality. There were also examples of the very best Greek and Egyptian sculpture and, on a much smaller scale, Renaissance and baroque paintings purchased at London sales. The sculpture included magnificent Greek statues of Hygeia and Athene, regarded as the work of Pheidias or his school, discovered at Ostia in 1797.<br>
<br>Hope encouraged and acted as patron of little-known artists of promise. As a young man in Rome, he early recognized the great neo-classical sculptors Bertel Thorvaldsen and John Flaxman, and provided them with important commissions. By his death Hope had no fewer than eleven works by Thorvaldsen including bas reliefs of himself, his wife, and his children. From Flaxman came a marble of the <span class="italic">Apollo Belvedere</span>, a group of <span class="italic">Aurora and Cephalus</span>, and, most notably, a series of 109 drawings as illustrations to Dante's <span class="italic">Divine Comedy</span>, which confirmed Flaxman as the pre-eminent English neo-classical artist. He also commissioned works from Antonio Canova, most notably a <span class="italic">Venus</span> delivered in 1822, and from painters. Here his interests included great neo-classical history canvases commissioned from artists such as Benjamin Robert Haydon, Louis Gauffier, and Richard Westall. But in contrast, his picture purchases also encouraged the picturesque and sentimental; he acquired works from young artists such as Thomas Daniell, John Martin, and Robert Smirke.<br>
<br>Hope sought out and sponsored craftsmen of merit to make furniture and objects according to his own neo-classical designs for installation in his Duchess Street showcase; those who made furniture included Francis Chantrey. He also extended his patronage to innovatory engravers such as Edmund Aikin and Henry Moses and to silversmiths such as Paul Storr. Of greater note was his encouragement of the architect William Wilkins. In 1804 Hope had vigorously and successfully promoted the purity of Wilkins's Greek designs for Downing College, Cambridge. In his outspoken pamphlet <span class="italic">Observations on the Plans &hellip; for Downing College</span> (1804), Hope laid down his opposition to the Roman Doric design put forward by James Wyatt, then president of the Royal Academy; Wyatt's defeat marked Hope out as a force to be reckoned with in architectural judgement.<br>
<br>Hope's collection was exhibited at his town and country houses for the instruction of visitors. His Duchess Street mansion, originally designed by Robert Adam, was greatly altered and extended with the ground and first floors being equipped with large galleries of neo-classical design; one visitor referred to the house as a &#145;temple of art&#146;. It was, in fact, neither home nor museum, more a place where the rich and informed were to be influenced. The rooms and galleries were lined with sculpture and paintings, vases, and other antiquities, all of exquisite quality. In 1807 he acquired a country home at Deepdene, near Dorking in Surrey, which he greatly extended in the style and setting of the picturesque. A mausoleum along with additional wings and a tower were completed in 1818 and a sculpture gallery and conservatory followed in the 1820s. All appear to have been the work of William Atkinson, with significant contributions from Hope himself.<br>
<br>So systematic was Hope's approach to the use of his collection as a didactic tool that entrance, at least to Duchess Street, was by admission ticket. He issued his first tickets in 1804. The recipients were sixty Royal Academicians who would be permitted, along with three friends each, to enter Duchess Street between February and March. This highlighted the seriousness with which Hope aimed to pursue his desire to influence taste, although on this occasion the absence of personal invitations along with the seeming impertinence of their young issuer was to leave the Academicians outraged. He also endeavoured to effect influence through his writings. <span class="italic">Household Furniture and Interior Decoration</span> (1807) was perhaps his most didactic and influential work and it was followed by <span class="italic">Costumes of the Ancients</span> (1809). On his deathbed he completed <span class="italic">Essay on the Origin and Prospects of Man</span> (1831).<br>
<br>In 1831 Hope fell seriously ill and died on 2 February at Duchess Street. On 12 February he was laid to rest in the mausoleum at Deepdene. Throughout his life Hope maintained his fortune; it is estimated to have been about &pound;200,000 on his death. Although Duchess Street was demolished in 1851, most of its contents were retained at Deepdene and in a new London family house in Piccadilly. The major dispersal of Hope's collection occurred in 1917, when his descendants sold Deepdene and disposed of its contents by auction at Christies; Deepdene itself was demolished in 1969.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13721"></a><span class="headword">Henry Philip Hope</span>  (1774&#150;1839), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was the youngest son of John Hope and his wife, Philippina Barbara van der Hoeven. He was born in Amsterdam and educated privately at home; he probably spent some time in Brunswick with his governor before studying at Leiden University. At fifteen he was described as &#145;the angel of the family&#151;an excellent heart and amiable disposition&#146;  (Ingram, 428). He was in Rome between 1795 and 1796 with his two brothers. He visited Pacetti's studio where he purchased some antiquities, a group of <span class="italic">Bacchus and Hope</span>, and a <span class="italic">Hermaphrodite</span>. Henry returned to Italy between 1796 and 1798, when he visited a number of northern cities, Naples and Rome. He was in London for the sales of the Orl&eacute;ans collection of paintings where he purchased approximately seven paintings to the value of &pound;2500. He became a member of the Society of Dilettanti in 1807.<br>
<br>Henry Hope appears to have been close to his brother, Thomas. The latter commissioned a portrait bust of him from Flaxman, for the dining-room at Deepdene, and Henry purchased the neighbouring estate of Chart Park for Thomas. In 1819 Henry lent Thomas the Hope collection of nearly 100 paintings he had inherited. Henry also patronized contemporary artists, purchasing John Martin's <span class="italic">The Fall of Babylon</span> (exh. British Institution, 1819) for 400 guineas. He died, unmarried, in 1839. In his will, proved with two codicils on 5 May 1840, Henry Hope bequeathed most of his art collection to his nephew, Henry Thomas Hope.<br>
