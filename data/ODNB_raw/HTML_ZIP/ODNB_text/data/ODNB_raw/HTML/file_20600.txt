<span class="headword">Ogilvy,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Pourie Ogilvy]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1587&#150;1601), <span class="occ">adventurer</span>, was the son of Gilbert Ogilvy of Pourie (<i>d</i>. 1601). His sister, Anne Ogilvy, married on 30 November 1587 Sir Thomas Erskine, a gentleman of the bedchamber of James VI and later earl of Kellie.<br>
<br>Scattered details about Pourie Ogilvy's life point to a career in espionage from the late 1580s. For example, when Thomas Phelippes, an informant of the earl of Essex in Flanders, encountered Ogilvy in 1595 he advised the earl to question Archibald Douglas, a diplomat of James VI in London, who had &#145;won&#146; Ogilvy &#145;to be a spy for Sr. Fr. Walsingham&#146; in Scotland, so that he had sent letters in cipher, for which &#145;he got a good store of coin from Mr. Secretary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 6.512). After Walsingham's death in 1590 Ogilvy occasionally reported to Douglas; in a letter to Douglas written on 8 January 1593, Ogilvy gave special attention to Angus, Huntly, and Erroll  (ibid., 4.279). In the revelations of the &#145;Spanish blanks&#146; in December 1593&#151;the blank sheets alleged to incriminate the three earls and others in clandestine negotiations with the king of Spain&#151;Ogilvy was identified as the original messenger to bring &#145;the Scotch king's instructions to Spain&#146;  (ibid., 4.216), but he escaped arrest by leaving the paper with George Kerr, who was charged with treason. However, Ogilvy's chances for advancement were ended on 30 September 1594, when he was proclaimed &#145;traitor&#146; and &#145;trafficking papist&#146; by order of the Scottish privy council.<br>
<br>Undaunted by this loss of status Ogilvy went to Flanders in June 1595 as a self-appointed deputy of &#145;the Catholics of Scotland&#146;, who, according to Phelippes, told English Catholic exiles that &#145;the king of Scots is well inclined, and if he may see men in the field he will venture all to be free&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 6.512&#150;13). Later, he claimed to be &#145;speaking on behalf of his king&#146; to Esteban de Ibarra, secretary of state and war, in offering certain Scottish fortresses to Spanish control if troops were sent to support King James  (Stafford, 150&#150;52). He had also elevated himself to the title of baron, although the standard authorities on the peerage have no evidence for a barony of Pourie. He arrived in Rome in December 1595 to see the papal secretary of state, Cardinal Aldobrandini, and the Spanish ambassador, the duke of Sessa, whom he visited privately at night. He revealed that James was hoping for financial aid &#145;to protect himself from rebel vassals&#146; as well as support for his claim to the English throne. He said he carried a sealed document declaring James's intention to become a Catholic, and prepared a list of &#145;Considerations&#146; showing James's benign treatment of Catholics. Aldobrandini gave no commitment and Sessa commented in his long report that Ogilvy seemed &#145;cunning&#146;, while Ibarra had thought him &#145;full of inventions&#146;  (Archivo General de Simancas, estado 967, 30 Jan 1596). Sessa also quoted the critical doubts of John Cecil, an English priest and secret informant for Robert Cecil  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 144&#150;6), but gave Ogilvy and John Cecil funds to go to Spain.<br>
<br>Upon arrival at the court in May, John Cecil informed Juan de Idi&aacute;quez, secretary of the council of state, that Ogilvy &#145;claims to come on behalf of his king&#146;, and as a baron &#145;is anxious to be treated with deference&#146;  (Archivo General de Simancas, estado 967, 15 May 1596). In a review of his papers, dated 15 June, Ogilvy recalled most of what he had told Sessa earlier in Rome, but on Ibarra's motion the council advised that confirmation of Ogilvy's credentials be secured from James VI and that he remain in Barcelona.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, an unexpected revelation outside Spain damaged Ogilvy's remaining hopes of returning to the service of King James. Word spread that copies of the letters of Sessa relating Ogilvy's activities had been seized by a French ship and, after they reached the courts of London and Edinburgh, had created a furore. When Bowes, the English ambassador, protested to James about Ogilvy's &#145;practices in Spain&#146;, the king denied &#145;any participation in them&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot. ser.</span>, 1589&#150;1603, 717&#150;18), so that Ogilvy's claim to &#145;speak in behalf of his king&#146; appeared more dubious. A detailed list of objections, submitted by John Cecil on 1 December 1595, led to Ogilvy's confinement for over two years, because it confirmed the suspicions of the Spanish council. In the summer of 1598 his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Erskine, pleaded for his release, but rather than return to Scotland, Ogilvy went to Madrid to petition the council in December 1598 for a &#145;salary&#146; of 100 escudos (about &pound;25) a month, on his claim of leaving Scotland &#145;because of his faith&#146; and suffering imprisonment and &#145;many trials&#146;. The council refused the salary, but &#145;to get him out of here more quickly&#146; gave him alms  (Archivo General de Simancas, estado 2763, 12 Jan 1599). Even then Henry Neville heard in Paris that Ogilvy stayed in Madrid on his so-called &#145;important business&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 221) before returning to Scotland. Later in 1600, the keeper of Brancepeth Castle related that &#145;by secret direction of the Privy Council, [he] apprehended a Scottish laird called Ogilby that came from the court above, kept him safe for 40 days and sent up [to London] his letters and papers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 10.204).<br>
<br>In the same year, in a deal similar to the one he had made earlier with Walsingham, Ogilvy sent reports from Scotland to Robert Cecil as &#145;John Gibsone&#146; and was paid for them  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot. ser.</span>, 1589&#150;1603, 791). Even then, when he tried to enter England again in January 1601, he was arrested and placed in the custody of Robert Carey, the warden of the Middle March, until Cecil ordered that he be sent back northward, with the comment: &#145;of the man I have heard as evil as I have heard of any&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.22). After this Ogilvy tried to make peace with King James, begging that &#145;your M. will use my poor wife and bairns according to your wonted clemency&#146; and insisting that he &#145;never had or used&#146; any commission from the king overseas and that he sought only &#145;justice and pity&#146;  (ibid., 11.559). On 4 July 1601 Ogilvy lamented to Cecil that peace with James was &#145;upon rigorous conditions which he cannot afford&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot. ser.</span>, 1589&#150;1603, 799), but was told not to enter England again, since the queen did not countenance those subjects of James VI &#145;to whom he declares publicly his offence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.290). On the death of his father, Ogilvy inherited his lands, but, still under the ban of the privy council, he had to leave for the continent, where his subsequent adventures have yet to be traced.<br>
