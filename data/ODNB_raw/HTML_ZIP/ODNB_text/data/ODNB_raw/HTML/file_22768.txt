<span class="headword">Price,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Carnhuanawc]</span>  (1787&#150;1848), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 2 October 1787 at Pencaerelen in the parish of Llanfihangel Brynpabuan, Brecknockshire, second son of Rice Price, vicar of Llanwrthwl, Brecknock (<i>d</i>. 1810), and Mary Bowen, his wife. In 1805 he entered Christ College, Brecon, after having attended local day schools. There he was taught to play the triple harp by a local harpist and attracted the notice of Theophilus Jones (1758&#150;1812), who was then working on the second volume of his history of Brecknockshire. Price's talent for drawing was turned to good account in the illustration of this work, which aroused an enthusiasm for Welsh history. A letter written to Jones in 1811, in which he described some Roman remains near Llandrindod, was printed in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> in 1814.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1811 Price was ordained deacon, and licensed to the curacies of Llanyre and Llanfihangel Helygen in Radnorshire. His ordination as priest on 12 September 1812 was soon followed by a transfer, in April 1813, to Crickhowell, where he served the parishes of Llangenni, Llanbedr Ystrad Yw, and Patrishow as curate-in-charge. To these were added in 1816 the neighbouring parishes of Llangatwg and Llanelli. In 1825 he became vicar of Llanfihangel Cwm Du, to which the curacy of Tretower was added in 1839. He was appointed rural dean in 1832. Crickhowell, however, continued to be his home until 1841, when he built himself a house on the glebe land at Cwm du.<br>
<br>Price first appeared as a Welsh scholar in 1824, when he contributed a series of papers on &#145;The Celtic tongue&#146; to <span class="italic">Seren Gomer</span>, under the name Carnhuanawc, which became his recognized literary title. He was already known as an informed and eloquent speaker on bardism and similar topics at eisteddfodau. Inspired by contemporary interests in minority ethnic cultures and pan-national movements throughout Europe, he became an enthusiastic pan-Celticist and laboured to develop Welsh&#150;Breton links, winning a prize at the Welshpool eisteddfod of 1824 for an essay on the relations between Armorica and Britain. He played a key role in persuading the British and Foreign Bible Society to support a Breton translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and began a long correspondence with the Breton scholars Le Gonidec and Hersart de la Villemarqu&eacute;. The Celtic connections of the Welsh interested him greatly, and during the next few years he travelled a good deal in Celtic countries. His account of his tour of Brittany was published in the <span class="italic">Cambrian Quarterly Magazine</span> in 1830. In 1829 he published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Physiognomy and Physiology of the Present Inhabitants of Britain</span>, in which he maintained against the Scottish antiquary John Pinkerton the doctrine of the single origin of the human race.<br>
<br>In 1836 Price began his <i>magnum opus</i>, the compilation of a history of Wales in Welsh. <span class="italic">Hanes Cymru</span> appeared in fourteen parts, the first of which was issued in 1836, the last in 1842: the work appeared also as a single volume in that year. Price's desire to secure as great a degree of accuracy as possible led to long delays. A cumbrous and pedantic style and the absence of any constructive treatment of his material detracted from the merits of the work, but it remained for many years the most trustworthy history of Wales.<br>
<br>Price, who had an attractive personality, was an indefatigable worker in all movements which appealed to his fervent patriotism. He was an early advocate of Welsh-language schools and was active in establishing the Welsh Minstrelsy Society and the Welsh Manuscript Society. He participated in the foundation of the Cymreigyddion, or Welsh Society, of Brecon (1823), and that of Abergavenny (1833). His involvement with the annual eisteddfodau of the latter society from 1834 drew the support of influential local gentry and antiquarians and they became the means of encouraging the serious study of Welsh literature and history, and an important channel for continuing the work of the previous generation of Welsh cultural leaders through groups such as <i>yr</i> <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95356', "hen bersoniaid llengar")</script> (&#145;the old literary clerics&#146;), of which he was a member. Price combined in himself traditional Welsh culture and scholarship and antiquarianism and he was thus able to attract both groups to share their efforts. He was a regular contributor to Welsh periodicals and corresponded widely on Celtic topics. He took a close interest in the Welsh (triple) harp, and through his exertions a school for players of this instrument was for a time maintained at Brecon. He was a regular, though not always successful, competitor at eisteddfodau; in October 1845 he won the prize of &pound;80 offered at Abergavenny eisteddfod for the best essay on the comparative merits of Welsh, Irish, and Gaelic literature. Other essays on the history of Welsh literature, the influence of Celtic literature on European literatures, and the <span class="roman">Statute of Wales</span> were published in his <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>. In 1847 he published a pamphlet on <span class="italic">The Geographical Progress of Empire and Civilisation</span>, an expansion of Berkeley's theory that &#145;westward the course of empire takes its way&#146;.<br>
<br>Price died, unmarried, on 7 November 1848 at Llanfihangel Cwm Du and was buried there. In 1854&#150;5 his <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span> was published at Llandovery, the second volume containing a biography by Jane Williams (Ysgafell).<br>
