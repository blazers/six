<span class="headword">Peddie,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1840), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, entered the army as an ensign in the 38th foot on 26 September 1805. He became lieutenant on 26 August 1807, and went with the 1st battalion to Portugal in 1808. He took part in the battle of Roli&ccedil;a, the battle of Vimeiro, Sir John Moore's advance into Spain, and the battle of Corunna. After serving in the Walcheren expedition he returned to Spain in 1812, and was present at the battle of Salamanca, losing his right arm. He was promoted captain on half pay on 23 September 1813, but was brought back to full pay in the 97th foot on 25 March 1824, and became a major in the 95th on 16 June 1825. After a further period on half pay, he became lieutenant-colonel of the 31st on 26 October 1830, and of the 72nd highlanders on 20 April 1832. In the same year he was made a KH.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1835 the 72nd, then quartered in Cape Town, were ordered to Grahamstown to participate in the first of the Cape frontier wars. At the end of March the British troops, under Sir Benjamin D'Urban, entered Kaffraria, and on 8 April Peddie, leaving the camp at midnight with four companies of the 72nd and the 1st provisional battalion, ascended the Izolo Berg. Having divided his forces into two columns, he attacked and routed the Kaffirs. By September operations were at an end; the Gaika country was annexed as far as the Kei (though the annexation was not ratified until 1846), and the 72nd returned to Grahamstown. A town in the newly conquered territory was named after Peddie.<br>
<br>On 23 February 1838 Peddie exchanged into the 90th regiment, then stationed in Ceylon. There his health broke down, and he died at Newara Elija in August 1840.<br>
