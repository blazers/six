<span class="headword">Paynel,  Gervase</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1194), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the grandson of Fulk Paynel who married Beatrice, daughter and heir of William fitz Ansculf, a <span class="roman">Domesday</span> tenant with land in eleven counties later known as the barony of Dudley. Fulk founded the Cluniac priory of Tickford in Buckinghamshire. His son, Ralph Paynel, was a supporter of the Empress Matilda. Gervase had succeeded by 1153. Respecting his father's intentions he founded the Cluniac priory of Dudley, for the salvation of himself, his wife, Isabella, and his son, Robert. In addition to the site of the priory itself, he endowed the house with the churches of St Edmund and St Thomas in Dudley, together with four other churches and land at Churchill. The monks received tithes, pasture, pannage, and seignorial rights, and were made subject to the prior of Much Wenlock. His wife was Countess Isabella, widow of Simon (II) de Senlis, earl of Northampton and of Huntingdon, and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1882/', "Robert, earl of Leicester")</script>. They married some time after August 1153. Gervase Paynel was also a benefactor to his father-in-law's foundation of Kintbury in Berkshire, later moved to Nuneaton in Warwickshire, and gave the nuns the mill of Inkpen, Berkshire. The vill of Greenham, in the same county, was given to the hospitallers. In 1166 Paynel reported to the king that he held fifty knights' fees of the old enfeoffment and five and two-thirds of the new. In 1172 he owed the service of one knight in the bailiwick of Le Passeis in Normandy; he had four knights in his own service. He participated in the rising of Henry, the Young King, in 1173&#150;4 and in consequence Dudley Castle was destroyed by Henry II in 1175. Paynel was restored to favour for the sum of 500 marks. However, his liberties at Newport Pagnell were taken from him and were not restored in his lifetime. None the less, he spent time with the king, witnessing charters at Tours and at Chinon. The latter was a grant to the abbey of Marmoutier, of which Tickford Priory had once been a cell. In 1187 Paynel confirmed his father's and grandfather's grants to Tickford and added others of his own. He was present at the coronation of Richard I on 13 September 1189. Paynel died in 1194, and since his son, Robert, had predeceased him, his heir was his sister, Hawise, who married first John de Somery and, second, Roger de Berkeley of Dursley. Hawise died <i>c</i>.1208; the barony of Dudley had passed to her son, Ralph de Somery, who had paid 300 marks for seisin in 1194.<br>
