<span class="headword">Power, Sir  John Cecil</span>, first baronet  (1870&#150;1950), <span class="occ">company director and public benefactor</span>, was born at Eldon, co. Down, on 21 December 1870, the younger son of William Taylor Power and his wife, Cecilia, daughter of Colonel John Burgoyne. At ten Power went to London where, with his brother, he was later to enter the firm of Power, Power &amp; Co., export merchants with considerable business in the East.<br>
<br>As a young man Power was delicate and had to spend three years in Italy, a sojourn which implanted in him a love of other countries and of travel which he was later to indulge whenever possible. In 1902 he married Mabel Katherine Louisa, daughter of John Hartley Perks JP of London and Wolverhampton; they had two sons and three daughters. After his marriage he bought a villa in the south of France to which he would go as often as business and, subsequently, parliamentary duties allowed. He paid a series of visits to the United States and went to Canada, India, and South Africa, afterwards lecturing and writing on his experiences. He served for many years as a member of the executive of the Travel and Industrial Development Association.<br>
<br>Real estate soon tempted Power away from the family business; he had an unerring flair for property, together with considerable financial talent. His name is associated particularly with Kingsway, a London thoroughfare which opened up what had hitherto been slum property between Holborn and Aldwych. A number of its imposing buildings, such as Adastral House, were of Power's provenance.<br>
<br>Power's success in real estate made him a wealthy man and enabled him to become a generous benefactor. His first great gift was in 1920, an anonymous benefaction prompted by the historian A. F. Pollard of &pound;20,000 towards the founding of an institute of historical research in London. Next, in 1923, came a gift of &pound;10,000 to the British (later Royal) Institute of International Affairs, for the erection of a lecture hall at the rear of the mansion (given by Colonel and Mrs R. W. Leonard) in St James's Square, London, which became known as Chatham House. Power was honorary treasurer of the institute from 1921 to 1943 and during his long association made many other gifts to the organization which included, in 1938, the leasehold premises of his own house in Chesham Place. This house he had hitherto made available to the British Council (before it moved to larger premises) of which he was honorary treasurer from 1934 to 1950. On the outbreak of war in 1939 the house in Belgrave Square, in which he was then living, was lent to the government for use as offices.<br>
<br>Power was for many years associated with the League of Nations Union, serving on the executive committee from 1929 to 1936 and, at various times, on its appeals, finance, and parliamentary committees. In addition he was a member of the committee of the Royal Humane Society and, from 1934 to 1949, a director of the Royal Insurance Company.<br>
<br>Politics early claimed Power's attention and in 1924, the year in which he became a baronet, he was elected Conservative member for Wimbledon, a seat which he held until 1945 when, his health beginning to fail, he withdrew to his country home in Hampshire.<br>
<br>Power's friends came from all walks of life; he enjoyed good company and was a generous host. The personal tastes of this tenacious and indomitable Irishman were simple; apart from golf and cricket, he had few hobbies save music. He had fallen under the spell of the opera as a young man and would talk nostalgically of the days when he had frequented the gallery of La Scala. Opera remained his abiding delight, and he was regularly to be seen at Covent Garden in the London season. He never fully recovered from the shock of his wife's death in 1945. He continued, however, to make occasional visits to Villa Fressinet at Grasse, where he died on 5 June 1950. He was succeeded, as second baronet, by his elder son, Ivan McLannahan Cecil (1903&#150;1954).<br>
