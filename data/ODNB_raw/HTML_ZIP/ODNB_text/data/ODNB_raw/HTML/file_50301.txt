<span class="headword">Pullin,  Alfred William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Old Ebor]</span>  (1860&#150;1934), <span class="occ">sporting journalist</span>, was born at Abergwili, Carmarthenshire, on 30 July 1860, the son of Alfred Trask Pullin, schoolmaster, and his wife, Adelaide Evans. His father was ordained in 1875, and held curacies in Yorkshire, where Pullin began his journalistic career in 1880 as Castleford district reporter for the <span class="italic">Wakefield Express</span>, before joining the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> as Bradford reporter. In the early 1880s he played rugby football for Cleckheaton, and he subsequently became a referee for the Yorkshire union. During the early 1890s, when newspapers were developing sports pages, he became cricket and football correspondent for both the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> and the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Evening Post</span>. He covered Yorkshire and England at his two sports, and for forty years wrote a daily column under the pseudonym Old Ebor.<br>
<br>Pullin's greatest achievement was to define the role of the journalist in sport as the critic, popularizer, and interpreter of a particular team to its public. His career coincided with the rise of Yorkshire county cricket. He followed the club round the country, becoming, in the words of the captain, Lord Hawke, &#145;the non-playing member of the county team&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 272). He wrote the <span class="italic">History of Yorkshire County Cricket, 1903&#150;23</span> (1924). The biographer of Alfred Shaw (1902), Pullin was a sound judge of cricketers and his criticisms were valued. His close and sympathetic relationship with the players underlay his best-known book, <span class="italic">Talks with Old English Cricketers</span> (1900). A pioneering work, <span class="italic">Old English Cricketers</span> (as it is often referred to) was based on interviews and helped to establish the idea that life after a career in professional sport could often be unhappy.<br>
<br>Pullin, who retired in 1931, had a wife, Alice, daughter of C. W. Ramsden of Wakefield, and three sons. He died, as he had wished, &#145;with his boots on&#146;: he collapsed on a bus in Upper Street, Islington, on 23 June 1934, while on his way to a test match at Lord's, and was found dead on arrival at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road, London. He was buried five days later at Wakefield cemetery after a service at Holy Trinity Church. In the 1920s recognition was paid to his position by his inclusion as one of the game's immortals in <span class="italic">Wisden Cricketer's Almanack</span>, but the florid prose of Neville Cardus and other later writers on cricket has perhaps put Old Ebor unduly in the shade.<br>
