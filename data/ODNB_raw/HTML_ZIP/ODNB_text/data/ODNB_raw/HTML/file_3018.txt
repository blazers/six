<span class="headword">Bouverie,  William  Pleydell-</span>, third earl of Radnor  (1779&#150;1869), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 11 May 1779 at 4 Grafton Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, the eldest son of Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, second earl of Radnor (1750&#150;1828), and his wife, Anne Duncombe (1759&#150;1829), daughter of Lord Feversham. Viscount Folkestone, as he was styled until his father's death, witnessed the early stages of the French Revolution when sent to Paris as a boy to learn French. He was tutored at home and went for two years to the University of Edinburgh before commencing his studies at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1795. His education culminated in a grand tour of the northern capitals of Europe from 1797 to 1799. On 2 October 1800 he married Catherine (1776&#150;1804), daughter of Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, earl of Lincoln. She died giving birth to a daughter in 1804. Folkestone's father arranged for his return to the House of Commons for the family borough of Downton in March 1801, followed quickly by translation to the more prestigious Bouverie seat at Salisbury, which he held from 1802 to 1828. The young viscount precociously broke with convention by making his maiden speech within a week of entering the chamber and established himself as a gadfly of government.<br>
<br>Although Folkestone aligned himself with the moderate William Windham during his first years in parliament, he quickly moved on to less conventional associations with Sir Francis Burdett and Samuel Whitbread. A pattern early emerged in his Commons career of impetuous and sometimes spiteful attacks on individuals such as lords Melville, Wellesley, Chatham, and members of the royal family. Folkestone rose to national prominence in 1809 as a principal prosecutor of the duke of York during a scandal involving the latter's mistress, Mary Anne Clarke, and the sale of military commissions, which led to the prince's resignation as commander-in-chief and personal disgrace.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Folkestone's own subsequent dalliance with Mrs Clarke became public knowledge and undermined his credibility and stature. He recovered some popularity with a spirited attack on the government's repressive legislation in the post-Waterloo years, when he personified his dictum: &#145;If a nobleman cannot perform his obligation, which is to protect the liberties of all the people, then he has no reason to take part in politics&#146;  (Huch, 80). On 24 May 1814 he married his second wife, Anne Judith (1790&#150;1851), daughter of Sir Henry St John-Mildmay, third baronet. They had four daughters and two sons, including the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3016/', "Edward Pleydell-Bouverie")</script>.<br>
<br>Folkestone succeeded his father as third earl of Radnor in January 1828, and in the House of Lords he supported parliamentary reform, the new poor law, the abolition of slavery, and repeal of the corn laws. He took the lead in the movement to accord full rights to non-Anglicans at Oxford and Cambridge, bringing in bills to abolish subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> (1835) and to revise college statutes (1837). He retired from politics in 1848, occupying himself with agricultural experimentation and philanthropy. Radnor died at his seat, Coleshill House, Berkshire, on 9 April 1869, and was buried at Britford, Wiltshire, on 15 April.<br>
<br>Radnor frittered away his influence through intemperance and unwillingness to accept responsibility. He rejected offers of junior office in 1806 and twice declined inclusion in Grey's cabinet, in 1833 and 1834. Though friendly with many whigs, he distrusted all who sought power. His father's repressive influence and a long friendship with William Cobbett distorted Radnor's perceptions of political reality. His hauteur and humourless sanctimony vitiated his considerable talents as a speaker and popular agitator. Canning lampooned Radnor's oratory, delivered &#145;with all the contortions of a Sybil without her inspiration&#146;  (Huch, 105). Radnor's advocacy of universal manhood suffrage, the secret ballot, annual parliaments, and disestablishment of the Church of England made him genuinely radical. His strong evangelical Anglican faith led Radnor to declare the corn laws unchristian. He sought atonement by making &#145;good use of his riches&#146;  (Brent, 125). His uncritical discipleship of the classical economists was, like his radicalism, unusual among the great landed magnates of his era, but Radnor left little in the way of a lasting legacy, except perhaps for <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, which his generous financial support helped to survive its birth pangs. His mixture of progressive ideas and aristocratic paternalism was more gracefully and effectively espoused by other whig grandees.<br>
