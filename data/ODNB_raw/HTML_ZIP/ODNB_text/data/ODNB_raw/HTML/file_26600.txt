<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Story,  Robert</span>  (1795&#150;1860), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Wark, Northumberland, on 17 October 1795, the son of Robin Story (<i>d</i>. 1809), a Northumbrian peasant, and his wife, Mary Hooliston, a native of Lauder, Scotland. He was educated at Wark School under Mr Kinton, with whom he made rapid progress, and then at Crookham, where he played truant and used to visit a lame fiddler. About 1807 he commenced work as a gardener, but found more congenial service as a shepherd, an occupation commemorated in one of his lyrics, &#145;Pours the spring on Howdsden yet&#146;. In the summer of 1810 he began to teach reading, writing, and arithmetic in a school at Humbleton. He subsequently served in various schools, where his unrefined accent and grammar often excited derision. He still desired to be a ploughman like Burns, but after some intermittent field labour, in the intervals of which he corrected the proofs of his poem &#145;The Harvest&#146; (1816), he returned to teaching.<br>
<br>In 1820 Story eventually started a successful school on his own account at Gargrave in Yorkshire, his home for over twenty years. There, on 17 May 1823, after a few sentimental episodes which he celebrated in his early poems, he married Ellen Ellison, with whom he had a large family. About 1825 he made the acquaintance of John Nicholson, the Airedale poet, in emulation of whom he issued a small volume of verse entitled <span class="italic">Craven Blossoms</span> (1826). He augmented his income by acting as parish clerk and by contributions to the Newcastle papers. But about 1830 his prosperity was rudely interrupted. Story argued forcefully against parliamentary reform and found himself opposed by the parents of most of his pupils who were withdrawn from the school. Story was further persecuted in numerous ways and his imprudent attempts at resistance involved him in debt. He met with some success in selling a volume of verse entitled the <span class="italic">Magic Fountain</span>, written in 1829, and his hopes were excited by the support he received for his poetic rallying cry to the Conservative Party, entitled &#145;The Isles are Awake&#146; (1834). For two years he depended mainly upon the help of his friends and the sale among them of his new volume entitled <span class="italic">The Outlaw</span> (1839), a historical drama taking place in the reign of Henry VIII. In 1842 he issued a literary autobiography called <span class="italic">Love and Literature</span>, which also was rather successful, mainly in the West Riding and in Northumberland, where he had found a warm friend in William Gourley, a self-taught mathematician.<br>
<br>In 1843 the Conservative members of parliament for the West Riding obtained from Sir Robert Peel a small post for Story in the Audit Office, and he consequently moved to London. There he had a struggle to make ends meet, and suffered greatly from the loss of four of his children; but his literary productiveness went on. In 1845 appeared a volume, <span class="italic">Songs and Lyrical Poems</span> (3rd edn, 1849), and in 1852 a versified tale of the heptarchy, <span class="italic">Guthrum the Dane</span>, in the style of Scott's medieval romances. In 1854 he visited Paris and was presented to Napoleon III as a successor of Burns, and in 1857 the duke of Northumberland issued at his own expense a sumptuous edition of his <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>. The beauty of the volume and of its contents seems to have impressed the critics of the time; and even Carlyle, in November 1857, said he detected in it &#145;a certain rustic vigour of life, breezy freshness, as of the Cheviot Hills&#146;  (T. Carlyle to R. Story, quoted in James, lxix). This is notably the case in a few of the lyrics, intimately inspired by the localities and the incidents of the poet's youth, such as &#145;The wild thyme still blossoms in green Homil-heugh&#146;, but the poems' merits are less obvious than Story's doggedness in trying to sell them to ease his burden of debt. He died at his home, 12 Harley Street, Battersea, on 7 July 1860, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
