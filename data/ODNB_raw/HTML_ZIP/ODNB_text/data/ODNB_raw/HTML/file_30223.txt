<span class="headword">Yonge, Sir  George</span>, fifth baronet  (1732&#150;1812), <span class="occ">politician and colonial governor</span>, was the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30232/', "Sir William Yonge, fourth baronet (c.1693&#150;1755)")</script>, of Colyton, Devon, secretary at war from 1735 to 1746, and his second wife, Anne Howard, the daughter and coheir of Thomas Howard, sixth Baron Howard of Effingham. He attended Eton College between 1742 and 1745 and the University of Leipzig from 1750 to 1752. After a brief period as secretary of the embassy at Turin in 1753, he was returned to parliament the following year as member for Honiton, which he represented continuously (except from 1761 to 1763) in successive parliaments until 1796. The Yonge family interest in Honiton was not strong enough to prevent a series of expensive contested elections in which Yonge is said to have spent enormous sums. An attempt to establish a woollen factory at Ottery St Mary reportedly also drained his finances. On 10 July 1765 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1833), the daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5586/', "Bourchier Cleeve (1715&#150;1760)")</script>, of Foot's Cray, Kent, a wealthy London pewterer.<br>
<br>Yonge described himself as a friend of the Grenville ministry, but in 1764 he voted against the government on general warrants and voted and spoke in favour of the repeal of the cider tax, to which he led opposition in Devon. The old corps whigs saw him as a possible friend, and although he attended the Cockpit meeting of government supporters on 9 January 1765 he was regarded favourably by the Rockingham administration. He was given office in September 1766 under the Chatham ministry as a lord of the Admiralty, and resigned from Grafton's administration in January 1770 &#145;for the honour of Lord Chatham&#146;  (Brooke, 674). In opposition he was a prominent speaker against North's American policy, although the content of his speeches was never extraordinary. He returned to office with Rockingham in April 1782 as vice-treasurer for Ireland. Despite his doubts over Yonge's competence, Shelburne made him secretary at war in July 1782; he left office with Shelburne in April 1783 but returned to the same post under William Pitt the younger in December 1783. He remained loyal to Pitt, who nominated him KB in 1788.<br>
<br>In July 1794, to make room for William Windham, who had joined the administration with the Portland whigs, Yonge was moved to the mastership of the Royal Mint, on the ground that its income was equivalent to that which he had enjoyed as secretary at war. He was troubled by the possibility that this office excluded him from the Commons as a government contractor, and did not stand at the 1796 election. Yonge was now facing severe financial problems; he claimed that his income had fallen well below the &pound;3000 he had expected as master of the mint, and he may have been living in a debtors' sanctuary at Holyrood in Edinburgh when he was offered the post of governor of the Cape in succession to George Macartney, Earl Macartney, at a salary of &pound;4000 a year. He was refused a peerage but was returned to parliament for Old Sarum as a client of the prime minister's cousin Thomas Pitt, second Baron Camelford, to avoid prosecution for debt.<br>
<br>Yonge was a man of long official experience when he arrived at Cape Town on 9 December 1799, but it was an experience that had no special bearing on his new task; his motives for taking the post were not of the highest, and he was probably too old to fall readily into new lines of thought and conduct. He has been described as &#145;decidedly the most incompetent man who has ever been at the head of affairs in the colony, though he possessed an amazing amount of self-assurance and pertinacity&#146;  (Theal, 62) and as &#145;corrupt to an extent shocking even to a society well-accustomed to corruption and so gross as to procure his recall within months&#146;  (Welsh, 98). His government was incompetent. He quarrelled with General Francis Dundas, the officer in command of the troops, whose authority he attempted to usurp. He also offended the Dutch community by increased taxes&#151;contrary, it was alleged, to the settlement following Britain's annexation of the colony&#151;and left the administration of affairs almost entirely in the hands of Mr Blake, his private secretary, and Lieutenant-Colonel Cockburn, his principal aide-de-camp, whose influence and support were believed to be marketable commodities. Yonge was criticized for inattention to the Cape's role in protecting British interests in India; Richard, Marquess Wellesley, governor-general of India, wrote to the secretary of state for war, Henry Dundas, objecting that Yonge was more interested in &#145;founding theatres and masquerade rooms&#146;  (Symonds and Fisher, 665). On 12 October 1800 Dundas told George III that Yonge's conduct at the Cape:<blockquote>has in such a variety of particulars been so wild and extravagant as to render it impossible to continue him in that Government without exposing this country to the imputation of being indifferent to the concerns of that most important settlement. (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.428)</blockquote>In January 1801 Dundas ordered Yonge home and appointed Francis Dundas acting governor. Yonge wished that the supersession should take place after a short delay, giving him time to wind up affairs; but whether in consequence of private instructions from his uncle, or from personal ill feeling, Francis Dundas insisted on the immediate transfer of authority. Yonge then applied to the commander-in-chief at the Cape, Vice-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, for a ship of war to take him to St Helena, but this was refused; and Yonge was left, waiting at a hotel, until he could find a passage. He did not arrive in England until towards the end of the year. Meanwhile, in February 1801, he was replaced as MP for Old Sarum.<br>
<br>The new secretary of state for war in the Addington administration, Robert, Lord Hobart, wrote to Francis Dundas requesting a report on various abuses said to have taken place under Yonge's government. Dundas appointed a commission at Cape Town, which, after hearing evidence, charged Blake and Cockburn with many gross malpractices and Yonge with being more or less cognisant of them. Among numerous scandalous abuses were the creation of new and unnecessary civil and military offices from which Blake and Cockburn drew salaries; the imposition of monopolies in the supply of timber and other trades from which a share of the profit was drawn; and private trading in slaves and personal aggrandizement in the awarding of government contracts, agreed without the knowledge of the Colonial Office. Cockburn denied the charge, and neither he nor Blake was tried. If anything was officially done or said to Yonge, it did not abash him. In July 1802 he was received by George III at Weymouth. It was very likely this friendship which protected him from further action, for the whole matter was allowed to drop; the return of the Cape to the Dutch by the peace of Amiens in 1802 was probably also a factor. Yonge failed to get re-elected for Honiton that year; he was spat on and his wig was set on fire when he tried to administer the bribery oath. Again in financial straits, he wrote to Hobart, claiming payment of his expenses for the journey home, and for the passage, diet, and hotel charges at Cape Town and at St Helena, which seem to have amounted to about &pound;1000. It does not appear these were ever paid, but he was given apartments at Hampton Court and the titular governorship of Tortola in the Virgin Islands in 1806.<br>
<br>Yonge died at Hampton Court on 25 September 1812. He had no children, and the baronetcy became extinct. The family estates were long sold; by 1789 the estates at Coplestone and Colyton in Devon had gone, and Yonge entertained George III and Queen Charlotte at the second family seat at Escott, but that too was sold in 1794. Yonge's widow continued to reside at Hampton Court, and died there on 7 January 1833.<br>
