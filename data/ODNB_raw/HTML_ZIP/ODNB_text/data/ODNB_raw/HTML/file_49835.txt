<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jackson,  Kenneth Hurlstone</span>  (1909&#150;1991), <span class="occ">Celtic scholar</span>, was born on 1 November 1909 at Melville, Lavender Vale, Beddington, Surrey, the younger child of Alan Stuart Jackson (1877&#150;1964), stockbroker, and his wife, Lucy Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hurlstone (1879&#150;1970). While his father's family included clerics and civil servants, his mother's contained several artists, notably Frederick Young Hurlstone (1800&#150;1869). His sister Christine trained at the London College of Art. His early education, which was interrupted by ill health, was at Hillcrest School, Wallington (1916&#150;19). He attended Whitgift Grammar School, Croydon, between 1920 and 1928. There his linguistic gifts blossomed, and he won an open scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1928.<br>
<br>Jackson did phenomenally well at Cambridge. After taking the classical tripos he transferred in 1931 to a new course on the cultures and literatures of north-west Europe, which was then being pioneered by Hector Munro Chadwick and Nora Kershaw Chadwick. Here, too, Jackson carried all before him. On being awarded a travelling studentship he opted to go to Ireland and Wales, to study with the most eminent Celtic scholars of the day&#151;Osborn Bergin and Gerard Murphy in Dublin and Ifor Williams in Bangor&#151;and to immerse himself in modern Irish and Welsh. It was through visiting the Blasket Islands that he met the great story-teller Peig Sayers, many of whose tales he published.<br>
<br>Jackson returned to Cambridge in 1934 as a lecturer in Celtic. He built up the Celtic curriculum and established the parameters for his own scholarly career: a multi-disciplinary synthesis of philology, literary criticism, and history; a comparative approach, drawing in other traditions and languages; and recognition of the value of material collected in the field, such as place names, dialects, and folklore. In 1939 he moved to Harvard, where he soon became associate professor (1940). Harvard proved congenial, and it was there that he launched his most important scholarly work. Nevertheless, he missed the modern Celtic speakers, manuscript collections, and fellow Celticists of Britain and Ireland. He was considered for the chair of Celtic at Oxford in 1947 and, although promoted to a full professorship at Harvard in 1948, accepted the Edinburgh chair when it was offered to him in 1949.<br>
<br>While at Edinburgh (1950&#150;79) Jackson emerged as the most respected of a brilliant generation of Celticists. He published on the ancient Celts, on the dark and middle ages, on all six modern Celtic languages, on folklore, place names, and dialects. Thus he spent much of his vacations during the 1950s recording Gaelic dialects for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. Although he disliked academic politics he served his turn in other ways: in the university, as a fellow of the British Academy (elected 1957), and as a commissioner for the ancient and historical monuments of Scotland. When he retired he held honorary degrees from universities in England, Wales, Ireland, and Brittany. In 1985 his unique pre-eminence in Celtic studies was acknowledged with the honour of being made CBE.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1936 Jackson married Janet Dall Galloway (1909&#150;2004), whom he had met at Cambridge. She was a psychiatric social worker, and daughter of Alexander Galloway, farmer. Her family came from Kinross, and she combined a robustly practical outlook with a lifelong devotion to the arts, especially literature. Her support underpinned Jackson's productive but punishing work schedule throughout his life. Their children Alastar and Stephanie were born in the USA, but brought up and educated in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>To Jackson his most important work lay in the history of the Celtic languages, building on the achievements of the nineteenth-century philologists. His monumental <span class="italic">Language and History in Early Britain</span> (1953) traced the emergence of Welsh, Cornish, and Breton from the ancient British tongue. <span class="italic">A Historical Phonology of Breton</span> (1967) scrutinized Breton from the earliest British colonists to the modern Breton dialects. Jackson also planned a matching history of the Gaelic languages. His <span class="italic">Contributions to the Study of Manx Phonology</span> (1956) fed into this grand plan. Many of his shorter works were also philological; but they included in addition influential contributions in folklore (for example, <span class="italic">The International Popular Tale and Early Welsh Tradition</span>, 1961), literature (for example, <span class="italic">The Gododdin: the Oldest Scottish Poem</span>, 1969), and text edition (for example, <span class="italic">The Gaelic Notes in the Book of Deer</span>, 1972). His popular <span class="italic">Celtic Miscellany</span> (1951), containing translations from all the Celtic languages, showed high critical intelligence and the verbal sensitivity of a poet <i>manqu&eacute;</i>.<br>
<br>As a scholar Jackson was outstandingly good at sorting complex things out. In all his best work he was comprehensive in grasp, penetrating in analysis, and lucid in exposition. Celtic studies needed all these qualities to counteract misunderstanding and ignorance&#151;on Arthur or the Picts or &#145;Celtic twilight&#146;. The degree of seriousness with which Celtic studies were treated by the time of his retirement owed much to the authority and force of Jackson's writing. Although subsequent research has altered scholarly understanding in many specialized areas, Jackson's works frequently contain the best statement of the case, and form the starting point for continuing scholarship. Few can claim such durability. His <span class="italic">Guardian</span> obituarist aptly placed him in an intermediate position between the nineteenth-century comparativists and the specialized scholars of today: they were the Gods, we are the mortals, and Jackson was a Hero.<br>
<br>Physically Jackson was slight but wiry; he coxed an eight while at St John's. He was an indefatigable walker, who harnessed his love of exercise and the countryside to his historical, archaeological, and place name interests. He enjoyed good food and wine in moderation, though in latter years moderation became extreme on account of persistent migraines. He had a keen eye for truth and beauty in art and literature. He drove others as hard as himself, but could see &#145;the other side&#146;, and even tell a story against himself, as when, in the early days of the Linguistic Survey, his attempts to interview Sutherland crofters on the sabbath met with a firm rebuff.<br>
<br>Jackson boasted that his job paid him to do what he enjoyed doing. Retirement consequently meant &#145;more of the same&#146;, and he had earmarked place names and Cornish studies as retirement projects. Since his big book on the Gaelic languages had eluded him, however, he decided to concentrate on that area. The result was his edition of <span class="italic">Aislinge Meic Con Glinne</span> (1990). Although he suffered a stroke in 1984, and could not work with the same intensity as before, this edition was sufficiently advanced for others to see it through the press. He died at the City Hospital, Edinburgh, on 20 February 1991 after a short illness. He was survived by his wife and two children. His funeral service, on 26 February, had been prescribed in all its details by himself. With typical modesty, he had instructed that a small chapel be booked, expecting that few would attend; in fact, the chapel was packed to overflowing. His remains were cremated at Mortonhall crematorium, Edinburgh, and his ashes were interred soon afterwards at the Surrey and Sussex crematorium, Worth, near Crawley, Sussex.<br>
