<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Haldane, Sir  (James) Aylmer Lowthorpe</span>  (1862&#150;1950), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, was born on 17 November 1862 at 14 Stafford Street, Edinburgh, the only son and sixth of seven children of Daniel Rutherford Haldane (1824&#150;1887), physician, and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth Lowthorpe (<i>d</i>. 1908). He came from the family of Haldane of Gleneagles, of which he later wrote a history. Educated at Edinburgh Academy, he attended John Brackenbury and Charles Wynne's Wimbledon School to prepare for entrance to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was admitted in 1881.<br>
<br>Commissioned into the 2nd Gordon Highlanders in 1882, Haldane spent the years 1888&#150;92 as adjutant of his battalion, being promoted captain in 1892, while attending the Staff College, which he left at the end of 1893. Haldane first saw active service in the Waziristan expedition of 1894&#150;5, and then with the Chitral relief force (1895) and the Tirah expedition (1897). In the latter campaign he served as deputy assistant adjutant-general on the staff, and in consequence of his valuable services in this capacity was appointed DSO in 1898. During the period 1896&#150;9 he was aide-de-camp to General Sir William Lockhart, who at the start of the period was in command of the Tirah field force and in 1898 became commander-in-chief, India. Haldane returned to his battalion in September 1899, just as it left India for South Africa.<br>
<br>Wounded at the battle of Elandslaagte on 21 October 1899, Haldane was captured by the Boers a month later (15 November) while in command of an armoured train. Also taken prisoner was the young Winston Churchill. The latter escaped by using a plan confided to him by Haldane and another officer, preventing them from using it, much to their chagrin. Haldane later insisted that he never again spoke to Churchill without the latter referring to the incident. However, he was later able to get away and return to his battalion, though he was invalided home late in 1900, and while on sick leave wrote <span class="italic">How we Escaped from Pretoria</span>, his first book.<br>
<br>In June 1901 Haldane took up duties in the intelligence section at the War Office. Rapid promotion followed: he attained his majority in July 1902 and a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy the following day. From 1903 to 1906 Haldane was deputy assistant quartermaster-general in the intelligence section and on the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war in 1904 he became a military observer with the Japanese army (the fighting qualities of which he admired) in Manchuria, returning the next year. In early 1906 he was promoted to a brevet colonelcy and gained the substantive rank at the end of the same year, in which he became assistant director of military operations, a post he held until 1909.<br>
<br>Haldane's staff career continued (as brigadier-general, general staff, eastern command) until 1912, when he took command of the 10th brigade in the 4th division. It was this formation he took to war in 1914. His brigade acted as the 4th division's rearguard for much of the retreat from Mons, placing a considerable strain on all ranks, and by the time it was over he had lost three of his four original battalion commanders (the fourth died in action on the Aisne in September 1914), but nevertheless his brigade had performed well at Le Cateau. It was not involved in the main fighting during the first battle of Ypres, holding the line to the south of that sector after capturing Armenti&egrave;res.<br>
<br>On the death in action of Sir Hubert Hamilton on 14 October 1914 Haldane succeeded to the command of the 3rd division, as a temporary major-general. For the whole of 1915 the 3rd division remained in the Ypres sector, for much of the time in the 5th corps, under Lieutenant-General Sir Edmund Allenby. Haldane developed a detestation of Allenby, partly (he later alleged) because Allenby pressed him to launch attacks without proper preparation. Suffering heavy losses in fighting around Hooge and Bellewaarde, the 3rd division could equally have blamed the inadequacies of the British artillery and its lack of ammunition in this period of the war for its misfortunes. It moved to the Fourth Army, on the Somme, in July 1916 and took part in the dawn attack of 14 July, gaining all its objectives; on finding no opposition to the division's front Haldane wished to use his reserve brigade to exploit the advance, but was overruled. His division was then involved in heavy fighting around Longueval and Delville Wood, before the conclusion of which he had left it.<br>
<br>On 8 August 1916 Haldane took command of the 6th corps, near Arras, becoming a temporary lieutenant-general in the process. To his displeasure he again fell under Allenby's command. On the first day of the battle of Arras (9 April 1917) his corps advanced on average more than two miles&#151;no mean feat by the standards of the time. In addition he presided over the capture of the important feature of Monchy-le-Preux two days later, before the Arras offensive degenerated into a slogging match. The 6th corps was also involved in the Cambrai offensive in November of the same year, and took an important part in repelling the subsequent German counter-attack.<br>
<br>During the German offensive of March 1918 Haldane skilfully handled the retreat of his right flank to conform with that of neighbouring units. His corps took part in the heaviest of the fighting in the German Arras offensive of 28 March 1918 and beat off all attacks, which, had they succeeded, would have changed the course of the war. He regarded this as his most testing period of command on the western front. In the hundred days the 6th corps was in action from 21 August to the armistice, advancing 60 miles in eighty-three days and fighting in eight major battles, including those on the Somme, at Arras, the Hindenburg line, and the rivers Selle (the latter a notable victory) and Sambre. Haldane's diary reveals him as constantly active and always planning not only the next attack but the one after that.<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly the 6th corps was selected as one of those to constitute the army of occupation in the Rhineland. Having been created KCB in January 1918 Haldane was promoted substantive lieutenant-general on 1 January 1919, giving up his corps command in November of the same year. His time on half-pay was brief, however, and on 21 December 1919 he took the appointment of general officer commanding, Mesopotamia (later Iraq), a former territory of the Ottoman empire placed under direct British rule by a League of Nations mandate. Briefed by the secretary for war, Winston Churchill, on the need to reduce the garrison there, which was a drain on British public finances, he arrived in Mesopotamia in March 1920.<br>
<br>Haldane's period in Mesopotamia was dominated by an Arab uprising that united Sunni and Shi&#145;a and led to the breakdown of civil administration during the summer of 1920 as the insurgents cut railway lines and telegraph communications. Early reverses included the rout of a column of the Manchester regiment on the Kifli road near Hillah on 24 July 1920. He regarded the following twelve days, when the rebels threatened to overwhelm the governing forces, as &#145;the most tense cycle of activity&#146; in his military career, even including his four years on the western front  (Haldane, <span class="italic">Insurrection</span>, 139). His principal problem was lack of manpower, and for much of the period he was compelled to husband his resources and undertake only fire-fighting operations, putting down one uprising only for another to break out elsewhere. &#145;We are living on bluff and have been doing so for weeks&#146;, he confided to his diary  (4 Aug 1920, Jeffery, 151). Only when twenty battalions of reinforcements arrived from India could he take more active steps to suppress the revolt, while restoring the damaged infrastructure. Following the relief of Kufa (17 October 1920) he was able to send out columns, supported by the RAF, to disarm the tribes involved. After a display of force at Suq al-Suyukh by a column under Brigadier-General Frank Coningham (1870&#150;1934) on 3 February 1921 he reported to the War Office that operations were at an end. He was present at the enthronement of King Feisal as the head of the new kingdom of Iraq in October 1921, and spent the remaining period of his command winding down the British military presence, which was replaced with a substantial force of local levies, before leaving Baghdad in March 1922.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain Haldane wrote <span class="italic">The Insurrection in Mesopotamia, 1920</span> (1922), a detailed account of how the insurgency was put down. He was regarded as somewhat tardy in his recognition of the role of air power in policing so large an area. His account included some frank criticisms of the British administration, whose methods he considered partly responsible for provoking the uprising, but described the military operations as a successful reconquest of the territory and insisted that &#145;The Arabs of Iraq respect nothing but force, and to force only will they bend&#146;  (p. 312).<br>
<br>Haldane was created GCMG in May 1922 and promoted full general in 1925; he retired in May 1926. Unmarried, he lived in London with his sister, who predeceased him. His autobiography was published in 1948. He died at his home at 107 Westbourne Terrace, London, on 19 April 1950 and was buried at Brookwood cemetery. He was a highly competent soldier; his career as a divisional commander, and even more as a corps commander, showed him as an excellent example of the type of technocratic general through whose efforts the First World War on the western front was won.<br>
