<span class="headword">Ayloffe,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1584), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of William Ayloffe of Hornchurch, Essex, and Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Barnardiston of Ketton, Suffolk. His grandfather William (<i>d</i>. 1517) was a bencher of Lincoln's Inn and perhaps the first armigerous member of the family, having received a grant of arms in 1512; he had in 1507 married Audrey, daughter of alderman Sir John Shaa, the London goldsmith, and widow of John Wrytell. It was the grandfather who established the family seat at Brittons in Hornchurch, where William Ayloffe the judge lived. Ayloffe was himself admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1553 and called to the bar in 1560. He was to be of great service to the inn in furthering the purchase of its freehold from his brother-in-law Edward Sulyard. In 1566 he was elected a bencher and in 1571 reader, serving as treasurer in 1573&#150;4. He was created serjeant-at-law in 1577 with six others, and left an account of the elaborate creation ceremonies which was published in 1984.<br>
<br>On 3 February 1578, less than a year after receiving the coif, Ayloffe was appointed a justice of the queen's bench and continued in that office until his death. He accompanied Chief Justice Dyer three times on the midland circuit, but in 1579 changed to the Oxford, which he rode with Francis Wyndham for the rest of his life. In 1581 he and Wyndham were suspected of being too lenient with recusants on the circuit, but it is likely that the fault lay with the county administration. That he was hardly popular with the Roman Catholics is evident from an absurd legend invented in the same year by some English Catholics in Paris. The story was that, after the trial of Edmund Campion, Ayloffe remained on the bench to await the return of the jury, and on removing his glove found that his ring was covered with blood; however hard he tried to wipe it away, the blood continued to flow as a miraculous sign of the injustice that had polluted the seat of justice.<br>
<br>Ayloffe seems to have died suddenly on 17 November 1584, having made a short will on the day of his death. Although he appointed his wife as his executor, in 1593 the will was pronounced void, apparently on the grounds that &#145;my wief&#146; was too imprecise. In fact he seems to have had only one wife, Jane, daughter of Eustace Sulyard, whom he had married by about 1560; they had three sons and at least one daughter. The eldest son, William (<i>d</i>. 1627), was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1577, knighted in 1603, and created a baronet in 1612; the baronetcy became extinct in 1787. A namesake admitted to the same inn in 1585 became the king's ancient serjeant-at-law, and as such leader of the English bar, in the later years of Charles I; he was also a great-grandson of the bencher who died in 1517 but by a different line.<br>
