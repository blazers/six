<span class="headword">Smith,  George Samuel Fereday</span>  (1812&#150;1891), <span class="occ">industrialist and canal manager</span>, was born on 7 May 1812, at Tipton, Staffordshire, the elder son of the ironmaster Richard Smith (<i>d</i>. 1868), and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Fereday, the most prominent ironmaster of the region. Smith was educated at Charterhouse from 1821 to 1830 and Queen's College, Oxford, from 1830 to 1835, where he graduated in maths and physics. He also attended University College, London, and studied mining and geology in Germany.<br>
<br>After working as a railway engineer, Fereday Smith (as he was often called) was appointed deputy superintendent of the Bridgewater Trust at the age of twenty-four. The superintendent, James Loch, had tried to recruit his father, Richard Smith, then mine agent to the earl of Dudley. The son was available; the father was not. Appointed deputy superintendent, G. S. F. Smith served the trust in a senior managerial capacity for over fifty years. In his late thirties he enrolled as a student at the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar in 1852.<br>
<br>Fereday Smith became extremely prosperous, partly through his salary, which increased from &pound;600 a year in 1837 to &pound;1500 by 1864. On 5 March 1845 Smith married Mary Jane, daughter of Richard Hampson of Manchester, who had a private income of about &pound;1000 a year. The couple had two daughters and a son. Smith and his wife benefited from the will of a maternal uncle, and also from that of his father, Richard Smith.<br>
<br>The Bridgewater Canal, administered by the trustees, faced growing competition from the railways, and Fereday Smith's influence was consistently exerted in favour of a strategy of meeting such competition with great vigour. He was a strong supporter of increased capital investment, particularly in terminal facilities at Liverpool, Runcorn, and Manchester, which he pursued against the reluctance of Loch. The results included the Egerton Dock at Liverpool, opened in 1840, to accommodate the trade in imported timber. Runcorn was developed from the late 1850s as a canal port for both coastal and sea-going ships. The salt trade from the River Weaver was facilitated by a new canal parallel to the Mersey, between Runcorn and Weston Point (1859). The Alfred Dock at Runcorn was completed in 1860 to handle the Irish grain trade, and in 1865&#150;7 major improvements were made to the Mersey above Runcorn. Fereday Smith also decided to install the electric telegraph along the banks of the canal. He made a practice of delegating to subordinates and seeking their advice. The one policy issue on which he held firmly traditional views was that of steam traction, which he opposed.<br>
<br>Fereday Smith's firm stance against the railway companies was significant, in that from the mid-1840s a sale of the Bridgewater undertaking to railway interests was periodically contemplated by his trustees. Between 1855 and 1857 the North Staffordshire Railway made a serious attempt to lease the trust's properties, which Smith was instrumental in defeating. The death in 1855 of James Loch, usually suspicious of his subordinate's expansionist approach, considerably increased the influence of Fereday Smith. From that date he became, in effect, general manager, although nominally subject to Loch's less experienced successor, Algernon Egerton. Under Smith's guidance the profits of the canal and its carrying trade rose from &pound;29,857 in 1855 to about &pound;54,000 in 1871, and those of the Bridgewater collieries from &pound;15,075 to about &pound;34,500. Control of the canal passed to the Cheshire lines committee in 1872 following a further growth of railway competition in the 1860s. Smith stayed on until 1887, when the Manchester Ship Canal Company acquired the Bridgewater.<br>
<br>Fereday Smith had wide interests outside the trust. He was a fellow of the Geological Society and the Royal Geographical Society, and a member of the Chetham Society (historical and literary). In politics he was a Conservative, sitting as a member of the police commission in Manchester from 1839 to 1842, and later as a councillor from 1846 to 1849. His public service also included a spell as a borough magistrate, and an active association with both the Manchester Commercial Association, and then the chamber of commerce (after a merger in 1858). In the early 1870s Fereday Smith bought Grovehurst, a country house in Kent, and became high sheriff of the county in 1884. He died from influenza and exhaustion on 26 May 1891 at 7 Sackville Street, Piccadilly, London. Smith was survived by his wife. His son, Richard Clifford Smith, succeeded him as general manager of the Bridgewater Trust in 1887.<br>
