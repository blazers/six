<span class="headword">Audley,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1439&#150;1524), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was the second son of James Tuchet, fifth Baron Audley, and his second wife, Eleanor Holland. His father was killed on 23 September 1459, leading Margaret of Anjou's forces at Bloreheath, but his elder half-brother, John Tuchet, sixth Baron Audley, deserted to the Yorkist earls at Calais in the following year, to become one of Edward IV's most consistent supporters. This may explain the rapid rise of his younger half-brother (who took the surname Audley) up the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Edmund was probably resident at Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1463, and graduated BA in 1467, subsequently proceeding MA by 1471 and DTh by 1482/3. Collated to the prebend of Colwall in Hereford Cathedral in June 1464, he was subsequently presented to a number of livings, and to prebends in Shaftesbury Abbey and in Lincoln, Salisbury, Lichfield, Wells, St Paul's, and York cathedrals. He became archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1475, and of Essex in 1479. By 1471 he was described as a royal clerk, and on 8 February 1474 received a clear sign of royal favour when he was admitted canon and prebendary of St George's Chapel, Windsor. On 21 February 1476 he received a papal dispensation to hold three incompatible benefices. All these preferments Audley resigned when on 7 July 1480 he was provided to the see of Rochester, being consecrated on 1 October following. He was the only bishop not of gentry or mercantile origins to be promoted under Edward IV; his prospects were not adversely affected by the change of dynasty in 1485. On 22 June 1492 he was translated to Hereford by bull of provision, receiving his temporalities on 26 December, and on 10 January 1502 was translated by the pope to Salisbury, the temporalities being restored on 2 April. Signs of continuing royal favour included his naming among Henry VII's executors.<br>
<br>In May 1519 Cardinal Campeggi, who was waiting to succeed Audley as bishop of Salisbury, wrote from London to his brother, observing, perhaps inaccurately, that the bishop was eighty and in failing health. In the event Audley lived another five years. So experienced a churchman inevitably exercised a conservative influence within his diocese, as he showed in his vigorous persecution of Lollardy, which had persisted in Berkshire since the early fifteenth century. During Audley's episcopate there were seventy prosecutions of people holding a variety of unorthodox opinions, with regular burnings of relapsed heretics, usually in Salisbury, in most years from 1502 to 1520. Audley's inquiries brought to light families and groups of friends who were able to sustain their beliefs without the help of itinerant preachers, and maintained sophisticated networks for the transmission of forbidden English books.<br>
<br>Audley's commitment to the pastoral office is beyond question. He owned a copy of the fourteenth-century preaching manual <span class="italic">Summa predicantium</span> by John Bromyard, was a trustee for the Savoy Hospital, founded by Henry VII in 1505, and even suppressed the nunnery of Brome Hall in his diocese on account of the immorality of the inmates (a prioress and two nuns), for which he received a letter of thanks in December 1521 from Henry VIII. His zealous persecution of heretics, however, points to the way the concept of pastoral duty had evolved since the end of the fourteenth century, from a responsibility for providing moral and doctrinal instruction to an inquisitorial determination to ascertain what people were thinking. This is demonstrated by Audley's willingness to involve even young children in his investigations. Edward Parker, aged eleven, appeared before him in 1508 because he had been discussing Lollard doctrine with his playmates: &#145;He said publicly when there were others present playing with him that the body of Christ was not in the sacrament of the altar&#151;and also that images of saints were not to be adored because they were stones&#146;  (Reg. Audley, fol. 148<i>v</i>). When asked by the bishop where he had learned these things, the child finally revealed that it was from his father.<br>
<br>A vigorous defender of the church's power and prestige, Audley was also in touch with humanist learning. He gave Lincoln College a Greek manuscript of the gospels  (Lincoln College, Oxford, Greek MS 18), <span class="italic">De situ orbis</span> by Strabo, and the <span class="italic">Astronomia</span> of Julius Formicus Siculus  (Lincoln College, Oxford, Latin MS 114), and a number of printed books of historical and theological learning. Oxford University regularly wrote to him as an important benefactor, complimenting him as a patron of learning for having collated Dr Edward Powell to a prebend in Salisbury Cathedral, and soliciting his assistance over the appointment of a bedel in 1481 and for contributions to the rebuilding of the nave of the university church in 1490. Audley defrayed the cost of the reconstruction of the old house of congregation in 1507/8; he gave 200 marks for the endowment of the Chichele chest in 1509; and in June 1518 he gave &pound;400 to Lincoln College as provision for the observance of his obit. Audley drew up his will on 11 June 1523, making provision for a chantry on the south side of the lady chapel of Hereford Cathedral, and for another on the north side of the presbytery of Salisbury Cathedral. It was in the latter that he was buried, four days after his death at Ramsbury on 23 August 1524.<br>
