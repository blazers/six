</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Opie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Alderson]</span>,  Amelia</span>  (1769&#150;1853), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, was born on 12 November 1769 in the parish of St George, Norwich. She was the only child of James Alderson (<i>d</i>. 1825), physician&#151;son of James Alderson, dissenting minister of Lowestoft&#151;and his wife, Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Briggs (<i>d</i>. 1784), daughter of Mary Worrell Briggs, from an established Norwich family, and Joseph Briggs, descended from an old Norfolk family but then on East India Company service at Cossambaza, Bengal.<br>
<br>As a child Amelia Alderson was high spirited and impetuous, traits which her mother, who was &#145;as firm from principle, as she was gentle in disposition&#146;  (Brightwell, 12), tried to restrain. Mrs Alderson was &#145;somewhat of a disciplinarian&#146;  (ibid., 6) and forced her daughter to overcome girlish fears of beetles and frogs by holding them in her hand. She was also taught to replace fear of the socially marginalized with philanthropic sympathy. She was fascinated by extremes of human experience, as exemplified by inmates of the local insane asylum, women who disguised themselves as men to follow lovers, and those tried at the local assizes. By her own account, interest in French, dancing, and other accomplishments considered appropriate for a lady began to displace these fascinations by the time she was in her early teens.<br>
<br>Upon her mother's death (31 December 1784), and in accordance with contemporary social convention, Amelia Alderson became her father's housekeeper and hostess. She was later described by a friend as &#145;universally loved and respected&#146; for uniting &#145;manly wisdom&#146;, &#145;feminine gentleness&#146;, and &#145;attractive manners&#146;  (Brightwell, 32). She had a flair for dramatic performance and a taste for music. She wrote part of a play based on Roman history and at least part of a Gothic drama. She also completed a tragedy, &#145;Adelaide&#146;, which revolved around family conflict caused by a socially unequal marriage  (Macgregor, 12, 14). With her father's sanction, it was staged at Norwich on 4 and 6 January 1791 in Mr Plumptre's private theatre, with herself in the title role and the Plumptre sisters taking other parts  (<span class="italic">Ladies' Monthly Museum</span>, 5, 1817, 62). In 1790 she had published anonymously <span class="italic">The Dangers of Coquetry</span> (2 vols.). She was vivacious, attractive, interested in fine clothes, educated in genteel accomplishments, and had several admirers.<h2>
<a name="Politicalinterests"></a>Political interests</h2>Amelia Alderson also had strong intellectual and political interests, which were soon fully engaged. Norwich was then a town of almost 40,000, with a large number of weavers and an influential community of religious dissenters; the Aldersons attended the Octagon Presbyterian Chapel, which had a cultivated and well-to-do congregation, many of whom were Unitarians. Norwich had a relatively large electorate of over 2400; political opinion was divided between supporters of government and whig reformists, and municipal and parliamentary elections were strongly contested. The outbreak of the French Revolution intensified these contests. Alderson's father and his friends were active in Norwich reform movements, then among the most vocal in England. They supported parliamentary reform and repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, which imposed second-class citizenship on religious dissenters. The Aldersons visited London circles of liberal dissenters and met other reformists at such places as the bookshop of Daniel Isaac Eaton.<br>
<br>In September 1794 some Norwich reformers began a periodical of their own, <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span>, and Amelia Alderson contributed fifteen poems to the first three issues. Increasing revolutionary violence and warfare polarized public opinion, however, and a large show trial of leading &#145;English Jacobins&#146;, including the Aldersons' acquaintances Thomas Holcroft and John Horne Tooke, was scheduled for November 1794. A month earlier Amelia Alderson had told Susannah Taylor that she was pessimistic at the outcome, that <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span> was considered a &#145;dangerous&#146; publication, and that the Aldersons and their friends would emigrate to the United States should the trial have a &#145;fatal&#146; result  (Brightwell, 45&#150;6). Horne Tooke was acquitted, and the government abandoned the other prosecutions; Amelia Opie later denied indignantly William Beloe's story that in her joy she had climbed over benches to kiss Horne Tooke.<br>
<br>Amelia Alderson associated with the controversial literary and political Godwin circle, which included such prominent writers as Thomas Holcroft, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Mary Wollstonecraft, and saw such friends as Sarah Siddons, Anna Letitia Barbauld, and French Girondin refugees. She wrote a tragedy with a view to London production, and submitted it for criticism by William Godwin and others. She attracted the romantic interest of several men, including Holcroft, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20800/', "John Opie (1761&#150;1807)")</script>, and perhaps Godwin. Opie was a carpenter's son from Cornwall and a self-taught artist married to a woman Wollstonecraft found &#145;too much of a flirt to be a proper companion for him&#146;; he divorced her in 1796  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 210). After a courtship of some months, he and Amelia Alderson were married at Marylebone church, London, on 8 May 1798, and then lived at 8 Berners Street. In December 1800 Amelia Opie indicated to Susannah Taylor that she thought herself pregnant, but despite their wish the Opies had no children. Self-conscious about his lower-class origins and culture, John Opie preferred literary and artistic friends to the fashionable circles that his wife enjoyed. Writing to Robert Garnham in 1801 Amelia Opie described herself as &#145;more a wife of the <i>old</i>, than <i>new</i> school&#146;  (Crabb Robinson MSS). To support their household John left the more prestigious historical and mythological painting for the more lucrative portraiture. He encouraged his wife's writing, and she later declared,<blockquote>On no subject did Mr. Opie evince more generosity, and liberality of mind, than in his opinions respecting women of talents, especially those who had dared to cultivate the powers which their Maker had bestowed on them, and to become candidates for the pleasures, the pangs, the rewards, and the penalties of authorship. (memoir in J. Opie, <span class="italic">Lectures on Painting</span>, 1809, 2.25)</blockquote>His professionalism, diligence, and independence inspired her, and her literary career developed rapidly.<h2>
<a name="Poemsandnovels"></a>Poems and novels</h2>Amelia Opie published five poems in the <span class="italic">Annual Anthology</span> (1799 and 1800), edited by Robert Southey and including contributions by many English Jacobins. In 1801 she published more poems with her first acknowledged fiction, <span class="italic">The Father and Daughter</span>, which her preface asserts is not a novel but &#145;a simple, moral tale&#146;. This distinction rejects the novel of manners, the dominant form of prose fiction, with its complex plots and numerous characters set in fashionable society, which was often criticized for encouraging middle-class emulation of decadent upper-class life. By contrast, the tale was to be simply structured, appealing to readers' moral feelings with post-revolutionary emphasis on common humanity and sentimentalized criticism of social differences that produce inequality and suffering.<br>
<br>The tale recounts the seduction and abandonment of a na&iuml;ve young woman by an aristocratic rake, the ensuing grief and madness of her father, the later remorse of the rake, and the reconciliation of father and daughter at death. Such fictionalized social protest was popular with reformists and liberals, and Opie's tale went through numerous editions. Fifteen years later Walter Scott told her &#145;he had cried over it more than he ever cried over such things&#146;  (Brightwell, 175). On it Maria Theresa Kemble based her play <span class="italic">Smiles and Tears</span> (1815) and W. T. Moncrieff his &#145;domestic drama&#146; <span class="italic">The Lear of Private Life</span>; Filippo Casari turned it into a &#145;serio-comic drama&#146; with a happy ending, later adapted by Luigi Buonavoglia, set to music by Ferdinando Pa&euml;r (1817); and there was a Russian version to music by I. Svechinsky (1823). As late as 1837 <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> predicted that <span class="italic">The Father and Daughter</span> &#145;will endure &#147;till pity's self be dead&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, 41, 1837, 409).<br>
<br>In August 1802 the Opies joined other British tourists flocking to Paris during the brief peace of Amiens. There they met the whig hero Charles James Fox, Benjamin West, the Polish patriot Ko&#347;ciuszko, the painter David, the actor Talma, and Helen Maria Williams, and they viewed the Louvre and sites of revolutionary history. After watching Bonaparte at a military review Amelia Opie was left shaking with excitement. In 1802 Amelia Opie also published two books of poetry. <span class="italic">An Elegy to the Memory of the Late Duke of Bedford</span> celebrates in heroic couplets a leading reformist whig of the 1790s, representing him as a virtuous aristocrat uniting different classes around a patriotic ideology of merit. <span class="italic">Poems</span> includes pieces published with <span class="italic">The Father and Daughter</span>. Subjects include &#145;The Dying Daughter to her Mother&#146;, &#145;The Maid of Corinth to her Lover&#146;, &#145;The Negro Boy's Tale&#146;, &#145;Lines respectfully inscribed to the Society for the Relief of Persons imprisoned for Small Debts&#146;, and &#145;The Orphan Boy's Tale&#146; and &#145;Address of a Felon to his Child&#146;, described in 1894 as &#145;the most popular of all her poems&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). There is the same combination of moral sentiment and social criticism that made Opie's fiction popular and respected, and <span class="italic">Poems</span> went through six editions in nine years. She was now a public figure, and accounts of her began to appear in magazines. In 1803 the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> praised her &#145;great sweetness of countenance&#146;, &#145;eyes beaming with intelligence and good humour&#146;, &#145;unaffected, affable, and engaging&#146; manners, fascinating conversation, and a singing style that &#145;reaches the heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 43, 1803, 323).<br>
<br>Despite such adulation Opie maintained her pace of publication with <span class="italic">Adeline Mowbray, or, The Mother and Daughter</span> (3 vols., 1804). It fictionalizes Wollstonecraft's and Godwin's attempt to counter the sexism and female subordination within conventional marriage. The heroine holds similar ideas and refuses to marry, living openly with her lover, until a series of disasters force her to repent of such free-thinking. Though the novel was read as a <i>roman-&agrave;-clef</i>, Opie generalizes her material as did the novelists of Godwin's circle, links the domestic and the public political sphere, and develops the pre-revolutionary literature of sensibility for post-revolutionary liberalism. Such fiction appealed to many in the reading public, and a third edition appeared in 1810. P. B. Shelley who, like Godwin, objected to marriage on philosophical and political grounds, later claimed to have been persuaded otherwise by Opie's novel, though James Mackintosh thought that it could as easily be read as &#145;a satire on our prejudices in favour of marriage, as on the paradoxes of sophists [such as Godwin] against it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Mackintosh</span>, 1.255).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Opie continued her pursuit of music. From the 1790s to the 1820s she published songs to music by composers including E. S. Biggs, Thomas Wright, William Horsley, T. Traetta, James Hook, F. H. Jones, Frances Alsop, Sir Henry Bishop, and Bianchi Lacy. Now she sacrificed attendance at the opera in order to take singing lessons; Susannah Taylor commented, in another magazine portrait of Opie, that she<blockquote>created a style of singing of her own, which though polished and improved by art and cultivation, was founded on that power which she appears so pre-eminently to possess, of awakening the tender sympathies, and pathetic feelings of the mind. (<span class="italic">The Cabinet</span>, 1, 1807, 218)</blockquote>Opie continued to exercise this power in her writing. In 1806 she published <span class="italic">Simple Tales</span> (4 vols.), first of several collections of stories varying in length and narrative methods, themes, characters, plots, and modes, from a few pages to a full volume, from common life to high society, from the comic to the pathetic, from the historical to the contemporary, from the sentimental to the Gothic. There followed <span class="italic">Tales of Real Life</span> (1813), <span class="italic">New Tales</span> (1818), and <span class="italic">Tales of the Heart</span> (1820). These collections were interspersed with triple-decker novels, really tales of greater length, including <span class="italic">Temper, or, Domestic Scenes: a Tale</span> (1812), <span class="italic">Valentine's Eve</span> (1816), and <span class="italic">Madeline: a Tale</span> (1822). An anonymously published novel entitled <span class="italic">Self-Delusion</span> (1823) was attributed to her by the <span class="italic">Ladies' Monthly Museum</span>  (18, 1823, 284), but there is no other evidence it is hers. Her story &#145;The Ruffian Boy&#146; was turned into a chapbook by the indefatigable Sarah Wilkinson, and dramatized by Thomas Dibdin and Edward Fitzball (1820), and her tale &#145;Love and Duty&#146; was turned into a melodrama by Isaac Pocock.<br>
<br>In their time, her tales and novels made Opie the most respected woman fiction writer of the 1800s and 1810s after Maria Edgeworth. Francis Jeffrey, leading liberal critic in Britain, reviewed <span class="italic">Simple Tales</span> emphasizing Opie's ability to represent feelings in &#145;common&#146; life so as &#145;to reach the heart of every reader&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, 8, July 1806, 465). Implicitly, this was a democratic art, uniting readers of different classes in a common sympathy, and this judgement was echoed through the nineteenth century. In her fiction, as in her poetry, Opie repeatedly links the conditions of common life to those in the public and political sphere; this was a central element in nineteenth-century liberal literature, and kept her fiction in print. The tales and novels, singly and in various collections, were reprinted through the nineteenth century, especially in the United States, with translations of individual works in France, Spain, and Sweden.<h2>
<a name="Widowhoodandsociety"></a>Widowhood and society</h2>After John Opie's unexpected death on 9 April 1807 his widow returned to her father's home in Norwich. In a preface to Opie's <span class="italic">Lectures on Painting</span> (1809) she eulogized her late husband in that Romantic genre, the bereaved spouse's memoir connecting intellectual or artistic achievement to private and domestic character. She visited London often, frequenting fashionable and literary society, and meeting such figures as Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Germaine de Sta&euml;l, Lord Byron, and Walter Scott. <span class="italic">The Warrior's Return, and other Poems</span> (1808) comprises pieces written earlier expressing sentimental humanitarianism and opposing war (&#145;The Warrior's Return&#146;; &#145;Lines on the Opening of a Spring Campaign&#146;), slavery (&#145;The Lucayan's Song&#146;), political violence (&#145;Lines on the Place de la Concorde at Paris&#146;), and courtly decadence (&#145;To Lothario&#146; and numerous songs). She had suitors, and Mary Mitford later insisted that Opie had engaged to marry Lord Herbert Stuart. She also corresponded and visited with William Hayley.<br>
<br>Opie renewed friendship with the Gurneys, a prominent Norwich Quaker family, and especially Joseph John Gurney. She addressed him as her &#145;monitor&#146;  (letters of Opie to Gurney, RS Friends, Lond.), and he repeatedly advised her to resist worldly pleasures, in 1817 anxiously inquiring in verse,<blockquote>
<div>Shall fashion's lure, shall flattery's heartless smile,<br>
</div>
<div>Thy higher, better, safer hope beguile?<br>
</div> (Braithwaite, 1.241)</blockquote>She gradually abandoned her family's Unitarianism but continued to enjoy society and admiration. The young dramatist Edward Fitzball saw that &#145;she was worshipped in society, not only for her great talent and her polished manners, but for her peculiar beauty&#146;, which reminded him &#145;of a lovely Bacchante, it was so voluptuous, yet so delicate and feminine, especially when she sang&#146;  (E. Fitzball, <span class="italic">Thirty-Five Years of a Dramatic Author's Life</span>, 2 vols., 1859, 2.61). The young Anna Eliza Bray met her at Norwich in 1819 and later declared she had rarely encountered a woman &#145;of such fascinating powers of conversation&#146;  (J. A. Kempe, ed., <span class="italic">Autobiography of A. E. Bray</span>, 1884, 138).<br>
<br>Opie also continued to write. In 1815 she edited her late friend Margaret (Wade) Roberts's <span class="italic">Duty: a Novel</span> (3 vols.), with a prefatory memoir representing Roberts &#145;as a wife, that character which is best calculated to call forth the virtues of a woman, and in which the heart and the temper are most tried and most displayed to view&#146;  (p. 1.5). In 1818 she told a friend that she was writing eight or ten hours a day. She also tried magazine writing, publishing several pieces in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (1823): a series of verse letters supposedly written by Mary, queen of Scots, at that time regarded as a victim of religious and political conflicts resembling those of Europe in the early 1820s; a memoir of Henry Bathurst, bishop of Norwich, advocate of religious toleration and champion of Catholic emancipation; and two stories, &#145;False or True&#146; and &#145;The Shipwreck&#146;, anticipating Opie's contributions to the newly fashionable literary annuals. She also continued to socialize, to follow events and literature of the day, and to enjoy material things such as fine clothes, though frequently reproaching herself for doing so. She admitted to enjoying Byron's <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>, though she was disappointed to find its reputed wickedness over-rated.<br>
<br>From 1820 Opie's father's health declined. She had attended Quaker services since 1814, and with her father's approval she was admitted to the Society of Friends in August 1825, after close questioning about her willingness to relinquish &#145;the world&#146;  (Opie to Arthur Corder, 4 July 1825, Gurney MSS). Her father died two months later, and at his wish was buried in the Friends' cemetery, Gildencroft, Norwich. Years later, someone's dinner-table reference to a father's affection for an only child caused Opie to burst into tears and flee the room.<h2>
<a name="Philanthropicwork"></a>Philanthropic work</h2>It had taken Opie some years to commit herself fully to the Friends, partly because of the linguistic and sartorial distinctness practised by Quakers, and she told Joseph John Gurney &#145;of the agony of her mind in the view of changing her dress, and of addressing her numerous friends and acquaintances by their plain names, and with the humbling simplicity of &#147;thee&#148; and &#147;thou&#148;&#146;  (Braithwaite, 1.242). At the time Mary Mitford heard that Opie &#145;is all over Quakerized&#146;, though &#145;just as kind and good-humoured as ever&#146; and after &#145;about a quarter of an hour's chat&#146; able to forget &#145;her <i>thee's</i> and <i>thou's</i>&#146; and &#145;altogether as merry as she used to be&#146;  (L'Estrange, 2.198&#150;9). Opie plunged into the kind of philanthropic work promoted by Quakers. She visited workhouses, hospitals, prisons, and the poor; promoted a refuge for reformed prostitutes; supported the Norwich branches of the Bible Society and the Anti-Slavery Society; and in 1840 represented Norwich at the national anti-slavery convention.<br>
<br>Opie claimed that joining the Friends meant abandoning fiction, which Quakers considered a form of lying, and thus sinful. In December 1823 she told Elizabeth Fry that a novel by her entitled &#145;The Painter and his Wife&#146; was advertised and several hundred copies had been ordered, but she now intended to abandon it, declaring, &#145;I have felt the sacrifice, but I do not repent of it&#146;  (Brightwell, 190). It would have comprised letters and narration, and presented two women both in love with the same man. In 1827 Mrs S. C. Hall requested a short story for a literary annual, and Opie replied that<blockquote>since I became a Friend I am not free to what is called &#145;make a story,&#146; but I will write a <i>fact</i> for thy annual, or any little matter of history, or truth, or a poem if thou wishest, but I must not write pure fiction; I must not <i>lye</i>, and say, &#145;so and so occurred,&#146; or &#145;such and such a thing took place,&#146; when it did not. (Hall, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 169n.)</blockquote>Opie did however publish fiction of explicitly didactic and ethical purpose; as she wrote to Gurney years later, defending a new, revised edition of <span class="italic">Adeline Mowbray</span> and some tales, &#145;I believe simple moral tales the very best mode of instructing the young and <i>the poor</i>&#146;  (23 Feb 1844, Gurney MSS). Harvey and Darton, leading publisher of books for children, issued <span class="italic">The Negro Boy's Tale</span> (1824; reprinted from <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1802); the prose <span class="italic">Tales of the Pemberton Family</span> (1825), resembling &#145;tales for youth&#146; by the prolific Barbara Hofland; and another anti-slavery poem, <span class="italic">The Black Man's Lament, or, How to Make Sugar</span> (1826). <span class="italic">Illustrations of Lying in All its Branches</span> (1825) presents moralistic social philosophy with a taxonomy of lies, particularly those kinds used for social competition and self-interest, and each illustrated by a tale, with the declared purpose of national reform designed to avoid social rebellion.<br>
<br>From 1824 to 1834 Opie contributed thirty-nine poems and prose pieces to literary annuals. In 1828 she published <span class="italic">Detraction Displayed</span>, a combination of conduct book and social analysis attacking social emulation and competition and defending such frequent objects of detraction as &#145;authoresses&#146;, bluestockings, and &#145;converts to serious religion&#146;, groups in which she included herself. <span class="italic">Lays for the Dead</span> (1834), her last collection of poems and last book, follows Felicia Hemans's popular treatment of Romantic death, but also resumes central themes of Opie's earlier poems, such as opposition to war, and incorporates expressly religious resignation to divine providence.<h2>
<a name="Travelsandlateryears"></a>Travels and later years</h2>Opie continued to take a great interest in public affairs and to compare them to the heady 1790s. She visited Paris in 1829 and felt ambivalent about the restored monarchy and awe-struck at the sight of a guillotine once more erected in public, though to execute a wife-murderer (the only case in which she thought she might support the death penalty). When she heard of the July Revolution in the following year she rushed to Paris and<blockquote>was in such a state of uncontrollable enthusiasm, all the visions of human perfectibility which the friends of her childhood had associated with the French Revolution rushing on her brain, that while sitting in the boulevards she sang in her clear, brilliant soprano, <span class="roman">Fall, tyrants, fall!</span> (G. T. Mayer, <span class="italic">Women of Letters</span>, 2 vols., 1894, 2.82)</blockquote>In her own account, Opie placed the July Revolution in the light of eternity and divine wisdom  (&#145;A morning at Paris in 1829&#146;, <span class="italic">Aurora Borealis</span>, 1833, 234&#150;40). She also met the French queen, who claimed to have read her works.<br>
<br>In 1832 Opie gave up her Norwich house for freedom to travel. She toured the Scottish highlands in 1834, went from Belgium up the Rhine to Switzerland in 1835, visited Keswick in 1836, and stayed in London often. In 1851 she went around the Great Exhibition in a wheelchair and, meeting Mary Berry in a similar vehicle, challenged her to a race. She indulged her passion for prisms and for flowers: &#145;Light, heat, and fragrance were three indispensables for her&#146;  (Brightwell, 334). She wrote letters constantly, estimating in 1849 that she averaged six a day plus notes, and she maintained the custom of sending anonymous Valentines. She holidayed at Cromer on the Norfolk coast, spring and autumn, as she had done all her life. She continued to attend trials at London and Norwich.<br>
<br>From 1842 to 1846 Opie looked after an ageing aunt. She herself aged well. In 1842 Caroline Fox reported, &#145;She is having her swing of London excitement&#146;  (Fox, 1.263), and in 1843 found her &#145;in great force and really jolly&#146;; she &#145;reads Dickens voraciously, takes to Carlyle, but thinks his appearance against him; talks much and of great spirit of people, but never ill-naturedly&#146;  (ibid., 2.24). In 1851 S. C. Hall found her &#145;a charming picture of what goodness of heart and cheerfulness of disposition can do to make age lovely to the last&#146;  (<span class="italic">Retrospect</span>, 2.185). In later life she was described as of average height for a woman, with fine hair, fair complexion, expressive eyes, and very fine clothes. Enjoying life almost to the end, she died at Norwich at midnight on 2 December 1853, after a few months of declining health and memory. She was buried in her father's grave.<br>
<br>In 1830 the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> placed Opie with Maria Edgeworth and Jane Austen among the major women novelists of the previous three decades, and defined her particular &#145;province&#146; as &#145;the passions&#146; and &#145;the exhibition of their workings&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 51, July 1830, 450). Opie's Quakerism, stressed by her Victorian biographers, obscured the political motive in her fiction, derived from the English dissenting and provincial Enlightenment and contributing to international Romantic liberalism. Well into the nineteenth century critics acknowledged what the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> called her ability &#145;to interest the feelings of her readers in a powerful degree&#146;. As with Felicia Hemans, this sentimentalism was philosophically grounded, politically mobilized, and essential to her feminized social criticism. By century's end, however, the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> could declare that &#145;Her novels, which were among the first to treat exclusively of domestic life, possess pathos and some gracefulness of style, but belong essentially to the lachrymose type of fiction, and are all written to point a moral.&#146; Such traits were rejected by early twentieth-century literary modernism and remained a problem for the later feminist criticism that retrieved other women writers from oblivion. Late twentieth-century historical and contextual research has initiated new understanding of the complexity and originality of her fiction and poetry.<br>
