<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Artaud,  William</span>  (1763&#150;1823), <span class="occ">portrait and history painter</span>, was born in London on 24 March 1763, the son of Stephen Artaud, a Huguenot jeweller, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was awarded silver palettes by the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1775/6, 1777, and 1782, and from 1778 attended the Royal Academy Schools, where he won the silver medal (for an academic figure) in 1783 and the gold medal in 1786. A Royal Academy travelling studentship took him to Rome in 1795, by which time he was already enjoying success as a history painter. There he was patronized by the radically minded William Henry Lambton, for whom he painted <span class="italic">Liberty Tearing Away the Veils of Ignorance and Superstition</span> (1797; drawing in the V&amp;A). The four years that he spent in Italy (1795&#150;8) coincided with the French invasion and are described by Artaud in part of a journal and in letters, chiefly to his father (John Rylands Library, University of Manchester; transcribed in Sewter). A number of informative sketchbooks also exist (distributed between eight institutions, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and Whitworth Art Gallery, University of Manchester).<br>
<br>Joseph Farington described Artaud as a &#145;violent democrat&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.485); he welcomed the French invasion of Rome but none the less twice had to flee to Naples (in 1796 and 1797), and finally left for Florence in March 1798. After five months there he spent a year in Dresden, arriving back in London in October 1799. The next four years were successful, and he exhibited portraits and history paintings at the Royal Academy, but they were followed by a &#145;slow but evident reversal of his fortunes&#146;  (Sloan, 84). This decline dates from the death in 1804 of his patron Bertie Greethead, through whom he had received commissions in Dresden. Artaud also seems to have failed to retain the confidence of the engravers upon whom his income chiefly depended, although he worked variously for or with Robert Bowyer, Thomas Macklin, J. G. Landseer, and F. Bartolozzi, among others. For Macklin's <span class="italic">The British Poets</span> he executed eight history paintings, of which a few survive, including <span class="italic">Jethro Bringeth to Moses his Wife and Two Sons</span> (Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh; engraved, 1792), and <span class="italic">The Woman Taken in Adultery</span> (Art Institute of Chicago; engraved by P. Thompson, 1794). Commissioned designs such as the lost <span class="italic">Conference between Wallace and Bruce</span> were not included in Bowyer's uncompleted illustrated edition of Hume's <span class="italic">History of England</span>. Artaud was an unsuccessful candidate for associateship of the Royal Academy in 1811, and last exhibited there in 1822.<br>
<br>Artaud's great ambition to be a history painter often led him to paint on a huge scale. This in part accounts for the descent of his reputation into obscurity, as so many of these unwieldy works have been lost, while the few that survive were mutilated or wrongly attributed until quite recently. Only half of Artaud's <span class="italic">Triumph of Mercy</span> (engraved by Bartolozzi) survives (1788; Yale U. CBA) but that half itself measures no less than 8&frac12; &times; 6 feet (241.3 &times; 204.5 cm). It plainly shows the influence of Gavin Hamilton's monumental compositions created in Rome (widely known through engravings by Domenico Cunego). It has been claimed that Artaud's paintings show him to have been &#145;as talented as any contemporary history painter and certainly better than many&#146;  (Sloan, 78). He habitually took itinerant working tours in the midlands, and his portraits can be impressive, painted in the manner of Thomas Phillips or, sometimes, Henry Raeburn. His drawing style resembles that of George Romney with a hint of Henry Fuseli, and many of his works are very striking: for example <span class="italic">John Deare's Wife at Rome</span> (<i>c</i>.1796; BM) and <span class="italic">The Temples of Paestum</span> (<i>c</i>.1796; Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester). The faintly preserved sketches that he made in Naples in 1796 of Lady Hamilton's &#145;attitudes&#146; (BM) are especially evocative.<br>
<br>Artaud seems not to have married; a self-portrait pencil sketch of <i>c</i>.1800 (NPG), in which he wears a studio cap, also shows two little children by a side table, but these could well have been the children of his sister Anna Susanna Tayler, through whom his papers and sketches descended. He died in March 1823 in London. The circumstances of his death are unknown.<br>
