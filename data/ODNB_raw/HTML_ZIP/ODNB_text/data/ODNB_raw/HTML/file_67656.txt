<span class="headword">Morris,  Reginald Owen</span>  (1886&#150;1948), <span class="occ">composer and musicologist</span>, was born on 3 March 1886 at 3 Grosvenor Terrace, St Giles, York, the son of Reginald Frank Morris, army officer, and his wife, Georgiana Susan Sherard.<br>
<br>Morris was educated at Harrow School, New College, Oxford, and the Royal College of Music, where he was later appointed to the teaching staff. Before the First World War he began to attract attention as a music journalist, and he contributed a memoir of George Butterworth to <span class="italic">George Butterworth, 1885&#150;1916</span> (1918). In 1920 Oxford University Press invited him to write the introduction and notes for their new edition of <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span>, and his article on Hubert Parry appeared in <span class="italic">Music and Letters</span>. In the following year that journal printed his essay on <span class="roman">Maurice Ravel</span>, and in 1922 his first composition, <span class="italic">Fantasy</span>, a string quartet, was published under the Carnegie scheme. In that year Oxford University Press issued his <span class="italic">Contrapuntal Technique in the Sixteenth Century</span>, which secured his reputation as a musicologist. The book was praised for its use of deductive reasoning, its balanced scholarship, and its literary style. More important, it broke new ground by distinguishing between national schools and by arguing that the study of counterpoint should be based on the techniques of individual composers rather than on arbitrary trends.<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">Contrapuntal Technique in the Sixteenth Century</span>, Oxford University Press published Morris's <span class="italic">Foundations of Practical Harmony and Counterpoint</span> in 1925. With these books he began to attract international attention, and in 1926 he was appointed head of the department of theory at the Curtis Institute, Philadelphia. But his tenure was short, and he rejoined the staff of the Royal College of Music in 1928. Though occupied principally with his duties as professor of harmony, counterpoint, and composition, he returned briefly to composing. Between 1929 and 1933 he arranged two groups of English folksongs; set texts by Sir Walter Scott, Thomas Campion, and Robert Bridges; composed <span class="italic">Corinna's Maying</span> for chorus and orchestra; and wrote a series of instrumental works that included a symphony and a violin concerto. While his arrangements and song settings were only moderately popular, his works for orchestra commanded greater respect: in November 1930 Adrian Boult and Arthur Bliss conducted a concert devoted to his instrumental music, and on 1 January 1934 his symphony in D was performed at the Queen's Hall. But by the early 1930s he had lost interest in composing, and he refused to discuss his music in later life.<br>
<br>Having rejected composition, Morris began to concentrate on writing and teaching, and as an author his body of work expanded rapidly: published in 1931 were <span class="italic">Preparatory Exercises in Score-Reading</span> (with Howard Ferguson), <span class="italic">Figured Harmony at the Keyboard</span>, and &#145;An introduction to music&#146;, in <span class="italic">An Outline of Modern Knowledge</span> (ed. W. Rose); in 1935 <span class="italic">The Structure of Music</span> was released; in 1937 he gained his DMus by examination; in 1944 <span class="italic">Introduction to Counterpoint</span> was issued; and in 1946 <span class="italic">The Oxford Harmony: Volume 1</span> became available. Never given to oversimplification, his books were designed to educate rather than to entertain; they were for the professional or the aspiring professional, and not for the layman. He was concerned that theory and execution should be complementary, and this belief dominated his activities as a teacher. In the classroom he argued that technical ability should be matched by a clear understanding of music history and style; that formalist ideas should be avoided; that students should expand their knowledge through experience; and that strict counterpoint should not be taught, as it was based on a false premise. He had the ability to explain clearly when teaching, often drawing upon parallels when clarifying an obscure point. But he was a hard taskmaster and he expected his students to work diligently; he had little sympathy for those who lacked dedication.<br>
<br>Morris's complex personality often puzzled those in his circle: he was pernickety about food, but was knowledgeable about wines; he could be austere, but often displayed a good sense of humour; he disliked ostentation and ebullience, but was often relaxed about life; and he could be aloof, yet was passionate about cats, cricket, and crossword puzzles. Professionally, he was also a paradox: composers like Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gerald Finzi, and Edmund Rubbra spoke highly of his works but performers generally ignored them. W. H. Mellers, writing in <span class="italic">Musical Opinion</span>, probably assessed Morris best:<blockquote>[He] is a teacher who writes music rather than a composer who teaches, and perhaps because of rather than in spite of our respect for him as a teacher we tend to lose sight of the fact that he is, if a small composer, a real one. (<span class="italic">Musical Opinion</span>, July 1941, 437&#150;8)</blockquote>Morris died at 2 Addison Gardens, Kensington, London, on 15 December 1948.<br>
