<span class="headword">Pigott,  Richard</span>  (1828&#150;1889), <span class="occ">journalist and blackmailer</span>, was born at Ratoath, co. Meath, the youngest son of George Pigott; his mother is believed to have come from Roscommon. His father, initially a clerk to a Dublin coach proprietor, worked for <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> newspaper. Richard Pigott's career began as an errand boy on <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, established in Dublin in 1842. He next worked in Belfast for the Catholic nationalist <span class="italic">Ulsterman</span>, founded by Denis Holland. In 1858, Holland moved the paper to Dublin, renamed it <span class="italic">The Irishman</span>, and employed Pigott as manager. During this period Pigott also ran a photographic business and began a lifelong trade in pornography. <span class="italic">The Irishman</span> failed to prosper, and Pigott was suspected of embezzling the accounts.<br>
<br>The founding of the Fenian <span class="italic">Irish People</span> in 1863 severely affected the circulation of <span class="italic">The Irishman</span>. Holland sold his newspaper to Patrick James Smyth, the former Young Irelander, but Pigott remained in control. In 1865 Smyth sold <span class="italic">The Irishman</span> to Pigott for &pound;700. Three months later the <span class="italic">Irish People</span> was suppressed. Its disappearance meant prosperity for <span class="italic">The Irishman</span>, whose weekly circulation between 1865 and 1869 was said to be 50,000 copies. In 1866 Pigott started two magazines, <span class="italic">The Shamrock</span> and the <span class="italic">Flag of Ireland</span>.<br>
<br>Pigott's <span class="italic">Irishman</span> was hostile to A. M. Sullivan's <span class="italic">Nation</span>, and in 1862 Sullivan successfully sued Pigott for libel. In 1868 both men were prosecuted for seditious libel for their reporting of the trial of the &#145;Manchester martyrs&#146;. Pigott was found guilty and imprisoned. His prosecution made him a nationalist hero, and in 1868 electors from the city of Limerick asked him to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming election to gain Fenian support. Pigott accepted but came bottom of the poll. In 1869 Sullivan again threatened to sue Pigott for an article alleging that in 1858 he had given the names of members of the Phoenix Society to the government, leading to their arrest. Isaac Butt and G. H. Moore arbitrated in the dispute; they acquitted Sullivan, and said that Pigott had given voice to opinions then widely held. Despite this Pigott's reputation was damaged; he was thought to be motivated only by money, and the circulation of his newspapers was damaged. In 1871 he was prosecuted for contempt, found guilty, and imprisoned.<br>
<br>Both the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Clan na Gael were increasingly dubious about Pigott. He was known to have abstracted money from appeals in support of Fenian prisoners and their families, and in 1869 he had taken money sent from New York to the Irish Republican Brotherhood in Dublin. Butt had acted as Pigott's guarantor for successive loans, and the coincidence of Butt's death and the founding of the Land League in 1879 brought matters to a head. It was now hoped that Pigott's desperate situation could be used to gain control of his papers and silence his attacks on the league. In 1881 Patrick Egan, treasurer of the league, negotiated with Pigott for their sale to the Irish Parliamentary Party; they were bought for &pound;3000. Charles Stewart Parnell closed them down and founded <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>.<br>
<br>Deprived of money from nationalist sources, Pigott began to sell articles attacking the league to the Conservative press in London and Dublin. In 1882, in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, he condemned the league, declared that Fenianism was dead, and urged all Irishmen to support the union. It was at this time that he first made links between the Irish party and violence.<br>
<br>In 1885, Pigott was again in difficulties. He approached Lord Richard Grosvenor, the Liberal chief whip, to ask for money to finance a pamphlet, &#145;Parnellism unmasked&#146;. Grosvenor sent him to Edward Caulfield Houston, secretary of the Loyal and Patriotic Union and a former Dublin correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, who paid him to research the links between Parnellism and crime. Pigott's failure to find evidence was the spur to forging letters associating Parnell with crime, which he sold to Houston in 1886. Houston now approached George Buckle, editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Buckle's proprietor John Walter, after taking legal advice, agreed to their purchase, despite warnings given by the attorney-general, Sir Henry James. The letters were published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in March 1887. The paper was sued for defamation by Frank Hugh O'Donnell MP, and evidence was given that connected Pigott with the letters. A special commission was set up to examine the alleged links between Parnellism and crime, and Pigott was interviewed by Henry Labouchere, and by Parnell's solicitor, Sir George Lewis. He told them that <span class="italic">The Times</span> had offered him &pound;5000 to testify against Parnell. Accused of forging the <span class="italic">Times</span> letters Pigott denied it but then agreed to sign a written confession, at the same time attempting to get &pound;1000 out of Labouchere, who demanded to see the original 1881 correspondence with Egan. Pigott now told <span class="italic">The Times</span> that Labouchere had tried to bribe him, but the solicitor to <span class="italic">The Times</span> insisted that Pigott should appear as a witness. Telling Labouchere that he was vulnerable to cross-examination, he was advised to ask for an indemnity against prosecution. Pigott's response was that he was totally dependent on the <span class="italic">Times</span> money. These events occurred over several days running up to 25 February 1889, when Pigott appeared in the witness box where he was cross-examined by Sir Charles Russell, counsel for Parnell. Russell asked Pigott to write words at his dictation; these included the word &#145;hesitancy&#146;, which Pigott spelt with an &#145;e&#146;, as in one of the <span class="italic">Times</span> letters. Pigott then denied that he was aware that <span class="italic">The Times</span> wanted to destroy Parnell, but Russell demonstrated that this was untrue and exposed Pigott's long history of blackmail. The next day, Pigott failed to appear in court, and Russell told the hearing of Pigott's confession of forgery to Labouchere. Pigott later told Shannon, a Dublin solicitor, that he had confessed because he feared prosecution for perjury. His confession could have meant that prosecution would be stayed and his children would receive &pound;2000. He also claimed that he had not forged all the letters.<br>
<br>Pigott had left for Paris on 26 February, and travelled to Madrid the following day. Arriving on 28 February he took room 13 at the Hotel de los Embajadores, in Calle de la Vittoria, as Roland Ponsonby. The following day, 1 March, he sent a telegram to Shannon, which was intercepted by the London police; they asked the Madrid authorities to detain him until their arrival. On his return to the hotel, the Madrid police were expecting him. Asking them to wait, Pigott went into the bedroom and shot himself. He was buried on 9 March 1889 in the civil cemetery of Nuestra Senora de la Almude&ntilde;a, Madrid; his funeral expenses were paid by the British ambassador, Sir Clare Ford.<br>
<br>A large man, bald in later life with a huge white beard, Pigott had always been a devout Roman Catholic, and he died wearing a number of religious medals. His wife, Theresa McDermott of Blackrock, co. Dublin, whom he had married on 17 February 1874, had predeceased him in August 1886; Pigott's suicide left their four children as orphans. It is still debatable whether Pigott was the author of all the letters sold to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1888. Parnell thought that Captain William O'Shea had a hand in them, and it is known that O'Shea, whose family had business connections in Spain, was in Madrid during the week of Pigott's death. His death in disgrace contrasts ironically with his own aspirations: Pigott had always described himself as a gentleman; he lived in the fashionable Sandymount area of Dublin, and probably enjoyed an annual income of &pound;2000 in his prime. W. B. Yeats elegiacally commented at the time of his death: &#145;Poor Pigott. &hellip; There was something pathetic in the hopeless way the squalid, latter-day <i>Erinnyes</i> [furies] ran him down&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, ed. J. Kelly and E. Domville, 1986, 1.151).<br>
