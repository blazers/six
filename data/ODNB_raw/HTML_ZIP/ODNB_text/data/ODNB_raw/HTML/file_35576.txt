<span class="headword">Popham,  Arthur Ewart <span class="st"> [Hugh]</span></span>  (1889&#150;1970), <span class="occ">museum keeper</span>, was born at Plymouth on 22 March 1889, the only son of Arthur Frederick Popham (1859/60&#150;1906) and his wife, Florence Amelia (1858&#150;1905), daughter of George David Radford, of Mannamead, Plymouth. His parents were cousins, the families being connected in a long-established draper's business, Popham and Radford, in Plymouth. His mother's brother, Sir George Heynes Radford, was a Liberal MP for East Islington and a senator of London University, and her sister Ada Radford married the sociologist Graham Wallas. His father studied architecture, and worked for a time for the Doves Press in the bookbinding department. Popham, known to his friends as Hugh, was educated at Dulwich College and University College, London; but Sir George Radford, who had taken charge of his education after his parents' death, sent him from there to King's College, Cambridge, where he took a second-class degree in classics in 1911. In July 1912 he was appointed assistant in the department of prints and drawings at the British Museum, being promoted to deputy keeper in 1933, and he remained in that department until he retired as keeper in 1954. During the First World War he served in the Artists' Rifles, and then in the Royal Naval Air Service, as a pilot. He later became a captain in the newly formed Royal Flying Corps. He was awarded the croix de guerre.<br>
<br>The official museum publications for which Popham was wholly or chiefly responsible between his return to duty after the war and his retirement in 1954 were: <span class="italic">Netherlandish Drawings of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries</span> (1932), completing the catalogue of Dutch and Flemish drawings, of which four volumes by A. M. Hind, whose notice Popham wrote for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, had already appeared; <span class="italic">A Handbook of the Drawings and Watercolours</span> in the department (1939), a very valuable general historical and stylistic guide; <span class="italic">Italian Drawings of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries</span> (1950, with Philip Pouncey); and <span class="italic">Drawings of the School of Parma</span>, which appeared in print only after Popham's retirement, in 1967. Independently of the museum, he was honorary secretary of the Vasari Society (for the reproduction of drawings) from 1925 to 1935, and in 1926 he collaborated with his colleague, K. T. Parker, in launching the periodical <span class="italic">Old Master Drawings</span>, something of a landmark in the history of the study of draughtsmanship, which lasted through fourteen volumes, with Parker as editor, and many contributions by Popham, until the outbreak of the Second World War. His own independent publications during this period were: a small book, <span class="italic">Drawings of the Early Flemish School</span> (1926); a revised and enlarged catalogue of the drawings exhibited at the Italian exhibition of 1930 at the Royal Academy (1931); and the catalogue of the Phillipps Fenwick collection of drawings (1935), much of which afterwards found its way, through the generosity of an anonymous donor, into the British Museum. Between 1921 and 1935 he also published several notable articles in <span class="italic">Print Collector's Quarterly</span>.<br>
<br>During the war Popham was at Aberystwyth, in charge of the collections which had been removed there for safety; this gave him an exceptional opportunity to study at his leisure not only the drawings from his own museum but also the treasures from the Royal Library at Windsor and from Chatsworth; and as a result he was able to produce, after his return to London as keeper of the department, a general book entitled <span class="italic">The Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci</span> (1946, rev. 1994), and in 1949 (with Johannes Wilde) the catalogue <span class="italic">Italian Drawings of the XV and XVI Centuries at Windsor Castle</span> in the series published by the Phaidon Press. During Popham's keepership the most extensive acquisitions were the Phillipps Fenwick collection of some 2000 Italian drawings and a large quantity of prints from the collection of Prince Lichtenstein, as well as single drawings which included fine examples by Leonardo da Vinci, Bosch, Raphael, Correggio, and Rembrandt.<br>
<br>After his retirement Popham acted in succession to A. P. Opp&eacute; as European adviser to the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, for the acquisition of drawings, and his catalogue of all the European drawings (other than British) in that collection, on which Kathleen Fenwick collaborated, appeared in 1965. Two other important independent books must be mentioned: his <span class="italic">Correggio's Drawings</span> (1957) sponsored by the British Academy, and the great three-volume corpus <span class="italic">Drawings of Parmigianino</span> (published in 1971, shortly after his death) for the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York&#151;a subject on which he had already produced a small book for the Faber series in 1953.<br>
<br>In 1949 Popham was elected FBA. He was appointed CB (1954) on his retirement and was elected an honorary fellow of King's College, Cambridge (1955). He would not have called himself an art historian in the modern academic sense; like most museum men of the days before the history of art was taught in British universities, he was self-trained by his daily work, and it was his unrivalled knowledge of the great British Museum collection, as well as of those at Windsor, Chatsworth, Holkham, Christ Church, Oxford, and elsewhere, that gave special authority to his judgements. As an expert cataloguer, he was interested above all things in establishing the authorship of the works he had to consider rather than in making pronouncements on an artist's wider significance. His style of writing was fluent and clear, strictly disciplined, and free of technical or theoretical terminology: only very seldom did he allow the natural humour that was evident in his conversation to appear in his published work, which was almost entirely confined to the study of drawings and prints and the history of collecting. Apart from his contributions to <span class="italic">Old Master Drawings</span> many of his findings on the history of collecting were concisely summarized in the introductory remarks and entries for the section on drawings in <span class="italic">Italian Art and Britain</span> (1960). But he had many other interests: calligraphy and carpentry, for instance, and many sorts of sport. His handwriting was distinctive&#151;exquisitely clear although minute in scale&#151;rendering his notebooks and correspondence works of art in their own right. He was tall and dignified in appearance, with a somewhat melancholy expression enhanced by his slow, drawling voice, which belied his character. On 3 October 1912 he married Brynhild (1887&#150;1935), daughter of Sydney Olivier, governor of Jamaica, later Baron Olivier. There were three children, one of whom, Anne, married the painter and writer Quentin Bell. On 11 January 1926 Popham married Rosalind Baynes (1891&#150;1973), divorced wife of Helton Godwin Baynes and daughter of Sir Hamo Thornycroft the sculptor. There were no children of the second marriage. His wives were first cousins. He died at his home, 4 Canonbury Place, Islington, London, on 8 December 1970.<br>
