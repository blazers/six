<span class="headword">Dongan,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1413), <span class="occ">bishop of Down</span>, was appointed archdeacon of Down in 1368 by Pope Urban V, and worked as papal nuncio and collector in Ireland. On 31 May or 1 June 1374, he was elected bishop of the diocese of Sodor and Man by the clergy of Man in St German's Cathedral, Peel. He received papal provision to the diocese from Pope Gregory XI, and was consecrated at Avignon by Simon Langham, cardinal-bishop of Palestrina, on 25 or 26 November 1374.<br>
<br>Dongan was imprisoned at Boulogne on his return from Avignon and only released on payment of a ransom of 500 marks. This delayed his installation at St German's Cathedral, Peel, until 25 January 1377, when he is said to have held his first pontifical mass and received many great offerings. He held a general chapter in February of the same year, when he inquired into the right of Whithorn Priory to hold land and churches in Man. In 1374 Dongan was also appointed papal nuncio and collector in his city and diocese and he may, therefore, have conducted an inquiry into the pattern of landholding in his diocese at this general chapter in 1377.<br>
<br>In 1380 Urban VI commissioned an inquiry into the allegation that John Dongan and William, bishop of Emly, apostolic nuncios and collectors in Ireland, had not handed over large sums which they had collected, thereby defrauding the apostolic chamber.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Dongan must have regained Urban's trust; in the bull of 15 July 1387, the antipope, Clement VII, gives Dongan's adherence to Urban VI as the reason Dongan was removed from the diocese. In his place, Clement VII appointed Michael, formerly archbishop of Cashel, as bishop of Sodor. This appointment appears to mark the final rift between the Hebrides and the Isle of Man within the diocese of Sodor and Man, the Hebrides following a Scottish antipapal course, and the Isle of Man, a Manx, papal one.<br>
<br>After 1387 Dongan continued to be recognized as bishop of the Manx part of the diocese of Sodor and Man while Michael was recognized in the Scottish part. Dongan appears to have worked for the bishop of Salisbury in 1390, and to have ordained in London in 1391 and 1392. He also appears to have been provided to the bishopric of Derry on 11 July 1391 and, from Derry, translated to the bishopric of Down on 16 September 1394, doing homage to the pope and receiving his temporalities on 26 July 1395.<br>
<br>In his later years, Dongan was active in negotiations between England and the lords of the Isles. In June 1405 he was appointed keeper of the liberty of Ulster, and authorized to deal with Gaelic Irish and Scottish enemies. In September 1407 Dongan and Janico Dartas, admiral of Ireland, were appointed to negotiate a final peace with Donald, lord of the Isles. Negotiations were still continuing in May 1408, but the grant of a royal licence in 1410 for the marriages between the son and daughter of Janico Dartas and the daughter and son of John of the Isles suggests that Dartas and Dongan may have been successful in creating a certain degree of peace.<br>
<br>John Dongan is said to have resigned from the bishopric of Down on 28 July 1413, and is presumed to have died soon afterwards.<br>
