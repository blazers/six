<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pembridge, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1320&#150;1375), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was descended from one of the collateral branches of the Pembridge family, whose main line had been established in Herefordshire from the reign of Stephen. He rose from relative obscurity to become a Garter knight of Edward III. His success illustrates the social mobility associated with a career in arms during Edward III's French wars, while the serious reverse he encountered at the end of his life reflects the degree to which sustained success depended on the favour of the king.<br>
<br>Pembridge's father was Sir Richard Pembridge of Clehonger, who represented Herefordshire in the parliaments of September 1337 and February 1338 and died in 1345/6. His tomb, together with that of his wife, Petronilla, survives in the chantry chapel which he endowed at Clehonger church in April 1342. Like many young men of his class the young Richard found himself on the wrong side of the law, when in August 1345 he was included in a group of men whose arrest was ordered as a result of misdemeanours in the Forest of Dean. This boisterous disposition may have helped to secure him a prominent place in Edward III's French wars, a record of which is provided by frequent references in the chronicles of Froissart. He was present at the battle of Cr&eacute;cy in 1346 and also at Poitiers on 19 September 1356. By then he was high in royal favour. He was granted a pension of &pound;30 a year from the exchequer in 1352, raised to &pound;40 and assigned on the priory of Ware in September of that year. By 1353 he had been knighted and joined the royal household. From 1360 he was a member of Edward III's small group of chamber knights, a distinction which he retained until his fall from favour in 1372.<br>
<br>Pembridge's rising prestige is reflected in appointments to receive Pierre de Lusignan, king of Cyprus, in November 1363 and Jean, king of France, on 4 January 1364. He also accumulated substantial wealth. Some time after 1360 he made a profitable marriage to Elizabeth, formerly the wife of Lord St John and Gerard Lisle, who held the manors of Kingston Lisle in Berkshire and Chilton Foliat in Wiltshire. During the break in hostilities following the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny in 1360 Pembridge was active in the land market, presumably investing the profits from his service in the war. In 1362&#150;3 he bought the Berkshire manors of Wadley and Wicklesham from Stanley Abbey, and in 1362 the reversion to the manor of Orwell, Cambridgeshire, from Thomas Scalers, who had no heirs. To these he added a string of the lucrative royal grants habitually reserved to chamber knights. In 1361 the king made him lifetime grants of the custodianships of Southampton Castle, the park of Lyndhurst and the New Forest, and the hundred of Redbridge. In 1364 he received the manor of Burgate by Southampton, which had passed to the crown by right of escheat. On 15 August 1367 Pembridge was appointed keeper of Bamburgh Castle and entitled to retain all the profits for his own use including a farm of 26 marks provided he bore the costs of maintaining the fortifications. Since a commission of 20 October 1367 was appointed to survey the dilapidations to the castle during the keepership of Ralph Neville, and the crown later attempted to enforce compensation from Neville's executors, Pembridge may have faced costs well in excess of the expected profit. In 1368 his service and his increasing landed wealth were recognized by his election to the Order of the Garter, occupying the fourth stall on the prince's side, an advancement which may have been associated with Edward's plan for renewing the war. In 1370 Pembridge purchased the constableship of Dover Castle and the wardenship of the Cinque Ports from Ralph Spigurnell, paying in return an immediate lump sum of 400 marks and thereafter an annual pension of &pound;100. This office carried an annual fee of &pound;300 and gave him an important role in the organization of ordnance and supply which offered the chance of further profit. On 6 July 1370 he supervised the embarkation of Sir Robert Knolles's expedition and in the same year received &pound;116 9<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. for his expenses towards the war. In addition to his administrative responsibilities he continued active service and was present at the naval battle of Bourgneuf near Brittany in August 1371.<br>
<br>Pembridge's fall from favour was sudden and may have been related to the dismissal from the chancellorship of his associate William Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, in March 1371. Early in 1372 the king instructed Pembridge to take up office as lieutenant of Ireland. This was an awkward appointment and Pembridge refused it. The preceding years had been characterized by a shrinkage of the English crown's legal and territorial control there, and William Windsor's attempt to increase the Irish tax yield during his lieutenancy (1369&#150;71) provoked such protest that Edward was forced to recall him. While Pembridge's recalcitrance is therefore understandable, the personal cost to him was high. He was deprived of his offices and ordered to leave the court. On 12 July 1372 a new commission was appointed to investigate the dilapidations at Bamburgh. But now special attention was paid to the peculation and maladministration of the deputies who had acted for Pembridge during his keepership. He died, still in disgrace, on 26 July 1375. His will is dated at London 31 May 1368, suggesting that it was prepared with the possible resumption of the war in mind. As well as making minor financial bequests to servants and associates Pembridge instructed that his body should be buried either in Hereford Cathedral or <i>in situ</i> if he died overseas. In either case a monument, enclosed with an iron railing and modelled on that of his fellow Garter knight William Beauchamp in St Paul's, was to be erected in Hereford Cathedral &#145;before the image of the blessed Mary on the south side&#146;  (Sharpe, 188&#150;9). The monument, in alabaster and probably of London manufacture, was sited in accordance with his will. Before his wife, Elizabeth, died on 16 September 1362 she gave birth to one son, Henry. He died, still a minor, on 5 October, passing the inheritance to the children of Richard's sisters, Amice and Hawise.<br>
