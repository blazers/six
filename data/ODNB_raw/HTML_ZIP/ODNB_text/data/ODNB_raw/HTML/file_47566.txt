<span class="headword">Thurgood,  Walter Leonard</span>  (1903&#150;1973), <span class="occ">transport entrepreneur</span>, was born in Church Lane, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 24 January 1903, the son of Charles Thurgood, labourer in a gun factory, and his wife, Lily Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Durton. He was educated in Enfield and at the Regent Street Polytechnic, London, and apprenticed to a coach builder in 1918.<br>
<br>Thurgood became a foreman at the Phoenix coach works in Ware, Hertfordshire, and this small home counties town, a centre of the malting industry, was to become the fixed base of most of his varied business activities, and to benefit from them in terms of employment opportunities. In 1925 he founded his own coachworks, W. L. Thurgood (Coachbuilders) Ltd, which built up a widening clientele of smaller stage carriage and private hire operators, spreading through the home counties into East Anglia and further afield. The coach building side of his entrepreneurial activities remained a constant factor (apart from wartime production) throughout the diversification of his business interests, and the works, in its final physical form, was sold to a rival as a going concern at the end of Thurgood's active business life.<br>
<br>In 1928 Thurgood diversified into bus operation, running mainly vehicles bodied at his own works on a network of routes radiating from the nearby county town of Hertford. The People's Motor Services network prefigured part of the subsequent operating pattern of London Transport from its Hertford garage. Nineteen single-deck buses and a van were acquired from People's by the London Passenger Transport Board in November 1933, Thurgood having previously sold two thirds of his interest to Messrs Overington and Randall.<br>
<br>Thurgood then turned to civil aviation, which was growing in both popularity and reliability. With Louis T. H. Greig as fellow director, Thurgood formed Jersey Airways Ltd and acquired its first &#145;airliner&#146;, a twin-engine De Havilland Dragon of 6/8 seats, which flew from St Helier beach to Portsmouth on 18 November 1933, three days after delivery. A fleet of eight such aircraft carried nearly 25,000 passengers in 1934 and six four-engined DH 86s were ordered. In November 1934 Thurgood, with Whitehall Securities, formed Guernsey Airways, but in December a holding company was established, Channel Island Airways, in which Railway Air Services and Whitehall Securities held part interests with Thurgood, who retained his shareholding until 1939. His links with Channel Islands transport lasted longer, with a large order being placed for Thurgood bodies by Guernsey Motors after the war.<br>
<br>Thurgood's pattern of reinvestment repeated itself after his close involvement in aviation came to an end, when he established a factory for the production of decorative, laminated plastic sheet with the punning trade name of Wareite. This was sold to the Bakelite group in 1940, Thurgood obtaining shares in the controlling company.<br>
<br>Wartime production in the coachworks appears to have concentrated on aircraft equipment, including jettison tanks, rather than vehicles. The works was destroyed by enemy action in October 1940, but rebuilt within a few months. At the end of the war coachwork production recommenced in late 1945 and the next few years, marked by a shortage of both private cars and new buses and coaches, were probably the heyday of the firm. New vehicle building was combined with a flourishing secondhand and refurbishing trade. The business moved to new, purpose-built premises on the edge of the town in 1953, which could handle double-deck buses. The BBC acquired the vacant works as a property store and also occupied additional buildings which Thurgood erected on his new coachworks site. In 1967 the coachworks was sold as a going concern to Plaxtons (Scarborough) Ltd, whose southern service centre it became.<br>
<br>Thurgood was active in local civic life, serving on Ware urban district council for nine years and meeting the cost of a coat of arms for the town (with the punning motto &#145;Cave&#146;). Thurgood can be epitomized, in John Hibbs's description of one of Thurgood's contemporaries, Edward Hillman, as a &#145;flying busman&#146;. His coach building led to bus operation, which in turn financed civil flying. Further diversification took in plastics manufacture and eventually property development. Throughout this varied career, the town of Ware and coach building were constant factors. Thurgood died of heart failure at the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, Welwyn Garden City, on 23 May 1973. He was survived by his wife, Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkinson, and six children. He was cremated at Enfield crematorium following a funeral service at St Mary's Church in Ware.<br>
