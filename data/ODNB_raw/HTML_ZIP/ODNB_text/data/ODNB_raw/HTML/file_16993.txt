<span class="headword">Longmate,  Barak</span>  (1737/8&#150;1793), <span class="occ">genealogical editor and heraldic engraver</span>, was the only son of Barak Longmate (<i>d</i>. 1763/4), of the parish of St James's, Piccadilly, who was descended from a Lincolnshire family, and his first wife, Elizabeth Weston. His mother seems to have died soon after his birth, and certainly before 29 October 1741, when his father married Mary Yeomans. In 1752 he was bound apprentice to James Wigley, citizen and clothworker of London, for &pound;10. On 2 July 1764, at Greenwich, he married Elizabeth Thompson (<i>d</i>. 1781).<br>
<br>Longmate seems to have begun heraldic engraving in private practice as early as 1760. By the 1770s he was contributing work to heraldic and genealogical publications, and by the end of the decade was also working on the editorial side. He was responsible for the fifth edition of Collins's <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, which came out in eight volumes in 1779, as well as for a supplementary volume in 1784; in the preface to the latter he announced a plan to publish an &#145;Extinct Peerage of England&#146;, but this was not accomplished. In 1788 he produced a small, two-volume work, <span class="italic">The Pocket Peerage</span>; popularly known as &#145;Longmate's Peerage&#146; this achieved some success, and he produced two further editions before his death. The small compass of these books did not allow much elaborate engraving but he continued to execute more distinguished work in other contexts, and regarded a large, separately produced plate, &#145;A genealogical history of the family of O'Sullivan More from Duach Donn, monarch of Ireland. Anno Mundi 3912&#146;, as his masterpiece. Hugh Clark, later editor of the successful <span class="italic">Introduction to Heraldry</span>, considered himself Longmate's pupil in heraldic engraving; how formal the relationship was is not clear.<br>
<br>To assist his editorial work and his private engraving commissions Longmate collected genealogical and heraldic manuscripts, and also compiled many of his own. Among the latter was a great &#145;alphabet&#146;, or dictionary of arms, such as engravers relied on when selecting arms for clients who did not know, or claim to know, what their arms were. Though of dubious function this dictionary (later owned by Thomas Willement; BL, Add. MS 30373) is important because it cites its sources. Compiled between 1760 and 1793 it illuminates how the published armories of this and later periods&#151;such as those by Joseph Edmondson, William Berry, and John Burke&#151;came into being. Longmate also made detailed extracts from William Segar's &#145;Baronagium&#146; (probably in connection with the projected &#145;Extinct Peerage&#146;), noted church monuments in the counties around London, and copied and updated many of the heralds' visitations, several contemporary manuscripts of which he possessed.<br>
<br>Longmate died at his house at 11 Noel Street, Soho, on 23 July 1793, leaving three sons and two daughters, and was buried four days later in the churchyard of St Marylebone. Part of his library was sold by Leigh and Sotheby, raising &pound;235 9<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_16994"></a><span class="headword">Barak Longmate</span>  (1768&#150;1836)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded him both in his business and as editor of <span class="italic">The Pocket Peerage</span>, of which he produced four further editions. By the time of the seventh, in 1813, the success of John Debrett's rival work was hampering sales, and no further editions followed. The younger Longmate was a friend and assistant of John Nichols and other antiquaries in his circle. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> states that about 1801 he made church notes in many parishes of Gloucestershire with a view to continuing the work of Ralph Bigland on that county, but that the project was abandoned after the disastrous fire at Nichols's printing house in 1808. On 12 August 1793, at St Paul's, Covent Garden, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Jeremiah Locke, of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields; they had no children. Having lived for many years in Margaret Street, off Cavendish Square, Longmate retired in his sixties first to Camden Town and then to Edward Street, Hampstead Road, east of Regent's Park. There he died, after a long paralysis, on 25 February 1836, and was buried on 3 March at St Marylebone. He was survived by his wife.<br>
