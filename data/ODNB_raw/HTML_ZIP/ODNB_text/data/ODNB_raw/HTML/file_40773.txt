<span class="headword">Nunes <span class="st"> [Nu&ntilde;ez]</span>,  Hector</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Dr Hector]</span>  (1520&#150;1591), <span class="occ">physician and merchant</span>, was born in Evora, Portugal. His family were among those Jews who had been forcibly baptized in 1497 by order of King Manuel I. He studied medicine at Coimbra University, taking a BA in 1540 and an MB in 1543. Because at this time the Portuguese Inquisition started to persecute the New Christians, he left Portugal. In 1549 he was living in London, in the parish of St Olave, Hart Street. In 1553 he was fined by the College of Physicians for practising medicine without a licence. In 1554 he was elected a fellow and in 1563 a censor of the college, with the responsibility for examining candidates and deciding which should be admitted and allowed to practise medicine. He had an uncle, Henrique Nunes, who was a merchant and physician living in Bristol from 1546 to 1554, to whom Nunes used to send the correct dates of the Jewish festivals.<br>
<br>Like his uncle, Nunes combined his medical practice with foreign trade. The London port book of 1566 shows him importing nineteen butts of sack from Cadiz. On 29 September in the same year he married Leonor (or Elinore) Freire of Antwerp, who also came from a Portuguese crypto-Jewish family. They lived in Mark Lane in the city of London. He figures frequently in the acts of the privy council as a trader with Portugal, where he is usually called &#145;Dr Hector&#146;.<br>
<br>As well as trading as a merchant, Nunes had a court practice as a physician. He prescribed for Lord and Lady Burleigh. He must have rendered service to the government, possibly in connection with the treaty negotiations with Portugal of 1572, for in 1573 he was granted a fifteen-year monopoly of the importation of Spanish wool for making felts and felt hats, subject to paying double customs. In 1574 he was granted the lands of St Mary's Abbey in Ireland, formerly belonging to the earl of Desmond. This transaction was followed by a series of unsuccessful attempts to win a lawsuit against the earl with the backing of the privy council, but the earl had powerful friends in Ireland and Nunes did not. In 1575 his wool patent was reissued and extended to twenty years. He was endenizened as an English subject in 1579 and after that publicly conformed to the Church of England, while presumably practising Judaism in the privacy of his home. The statute concerning the burning of heretics (<span class="italic">De haeretico comburendo</span>) made it unsafe to do otherwise. Lawsuits in the admiralty and queen's bench courts show that he traded to Spain and Portugal, imported Brazilian sugar, and acted as a marine insurance broker. In 1582 his household included his wife, three clerks, and two black women. Nunes and his wife had no surviving children.<br>
<br>In 1583 Lord Henry Howard, then a state prisoner in the Fleet, wrote to the secretary of state, Sir Francis Walsingham, to ask permission to consult his old physician &#145;Dr Hector&#146;. Walsingham employed Nunes as his intermediary from 1585 to 1586 in opening peace negotiations with Spain. This he did by corresponding with Dr Ant&oacute;nio Castilho, who had been Portuguese ambassador in London in 1580. After these negotiations failed, Nunes kept Walsingham informed about the preparations of the Spanish armada in Lisbon. In 1588 Spaniards in London reported this back to Philip II. Nunes's brother-in-law and partner, Bernardo Luis Freire, was arrested and interrogated in Madrid.<br>
<br>Nunes died in Mark Lane, London, in September 1591 and was buried at his request in the churchyard of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. The provisions of his will imply that he had modest means. In it Nunes describes Lord Burleigh as his &#145;verie good lorde&#146; and mentions his friendship with Sir Thomas Heneage.<br>
<br>Nunes was a well-known figure in Elizabethan London, both as a physician and as a merchant. His trading connections with Spain and Portugal, his vulnerability as a refugee, and his loyalty made him valuable to the English government. Walsingham made good use of him both as a diplomatic intermediary and as a source of intelligence about the Spanish armada.<br>
