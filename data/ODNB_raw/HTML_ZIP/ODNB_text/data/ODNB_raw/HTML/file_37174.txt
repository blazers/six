<span class="headword">Bell,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1647, <em>d.</em> 1711), <span class="occ">architect and merchant</span>, was baptized on 8 July 1647 in King's Lynn, Norfolk, the son of Henry Bell (<i>d</i>. 1686), mercer. He was educated at the local grammar school and then Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took his BA degree in 1665, before embarking on a grand tour. On 28 February 1678 he married Anne Brumble; they had five sons and one daughter. In 1686 he inherited his father's properties and continued his successful business as a producer of linseed and rape oil. His status in the merchant community is attested by his becoming an alderman in 1690 and, following his father, serving as mayor of King's Lynn in 1692 and 1703.<br>
<br>An educated and cultivated gentleman, Bell's travels played an important part in the formation of his taste, both as a connoisseur of paintings and as an architect. His own collection, bequeathed to his youngest son, William, included works said to be by Hans Holbein, Rembrandt, Egbert van Heemskerk and his father, and Hendrick Goltzius. He practised architecture as a pastime rather than as a full-time profession. In the brief memoir of his life, which prefixes his posthumously published <span class="italic">An Historical Essay on the Original of Painting</span> (1728), Bell's travels are said to have &#145;conduced very much to his Improvement&#146; in architecture, the &#145;Mistress of &hellip; (his) Affections&#146;. His style owed a great deal to Dutch architecture, as well as to the work of Sir Christopher Wren. He first came to notice for his role in planning the rebuilding of Northampton after the fire of 1675. He was certainly at least jointly responsible for the rebuilding (1677&#150;80) of the town's All Saints' Church and was perhaps involved also in the designing of the sessions house (1676&#150;88), as well as houses in the market place.<br>
<br>Bell's most important surviving building is the custom house, King's Lynn, built in 1683 as an exchange, at the expense of the wine merchant and member of parliament Sir John Turner, and sold to the customs authorities in 1718. This square building, with an arcaded ground floor, steep roof, and lantern, is articulated by superimposed orders which carry Bell's characteristic garlanded, Ionic capitals. This motif occurs also at his church at North Runcton, Norfolk, rebuilt in 1703&#150;13, which shares with All Saints' in Northampton the plan of a Greek cross within a rectangle, probably derived from Wren's St Mary-at-Hill. Of Bell's other documented works, all in King's Lynn, the domed, octagonal market cross (1707&#150;10; dem. 1831) was the most notable. It is likely that he was responsible also for the surviving Duke's Head inn, in the town's Tuesday Market, built about 1684 for Sir John Turner to accommodate those visiting the exchange. On stylistic grounds we may also attribute to him the church of St Genevieve at Euston, Suffolk (1676), the courtyard of Kimbolton Castle, Huntingdonshire (<i>c</i>.1685), and Stanhoe Hall, Norfolk (1703), built for Thomas Archdale (MP for High Wycombe in 1698&#150;9) and his wife, Jane, the daughter of Charles Turner, Sir John's younger brother.<br>
<br>Bell has a small but significant place in English architectural history, not only for the strength of his designs but also as an occasional architect coming, unusually, from the mercantile community rather than from the court or the gentry. He signed his will in 1706 and died in King's Lynn on 11 April 1711, leaving substantial properties to his wife and family. He was buried in St Margaret's Church, King's Lynn, in which he had been baptized and married.<br>
