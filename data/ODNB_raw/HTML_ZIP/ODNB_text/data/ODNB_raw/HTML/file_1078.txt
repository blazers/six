<span class="headword">Baily,  John Walker</span>  (1809&#150;1873), <span class="occ">collector of antiquities</span>, was born on 9 January 1809 in Kent Road, London, the second son of William Baily, an ironmonger, of 71 Gracechurch Street, London, and his wife, Susanna. He was educated at an academy in Walcot Place Road, Lambeth, and he succeeded his father in running the business. In 1862&#150;3 he was master of the Ironmongers' Company. He married Marianne Marriot (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1809) of Chertsey, Surrey, and had two sons, Walker and William Henry, and four daughters.<br>
<br>Baily shared his interest in collecting with both of his brothers (the younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1075/', "Charles Baily")</script>, became an antiquary). In 1825 he purchased some archaeological finds from workmen excavating in Walworth Road, although from 1830 to 1840 he collected mostly arms and armour. In 1840 he built a Jacobean-style house in Camberwell named Champion Park, where he arranged his collection around the hall, stairs, and breakfast room. In May 1861 he loaned various items for the exhibition at Ironmongers' Hall, London, which he also helped to organize.<br>
<br>From 1863 Baily began collecting the Roman and medieval antiquities that were being unearthed on building sites and railway excavations in the City of London and Southwark. His principal acquisitions came from the Walbrook, from Roman cemeteries around the City perimeter, and from reclaimed land in Thames Street. Like his predecessor Charles Roach Smith, Baily made his purchases from touts who haunted the building sites, who always visited him first because he paid for seeing what they had to sell. Before long Champion Park was overcrowded with exhibits, for which Baily added a northern wing in 1869.<br>
<br>As well as pottery, coins, glass, and leatherwork, Baily's collection was remarkable for the weapons, which included a Roman trident, a Viking battleaxe, and a two-handed medieval sword. Among other notable acquisitions were a &#145;Tudor green&#146; lobed cup decorated with a small clay model of a stag and a twelfth-century Romanesque hanging lamp (which Baily mistook for Roman). The collection's importance is enhanced by the beautiful manuscript catalogue that he prepared, which contains nearly 400 pages of accomplished watercolour drawings, together with the dimensions and find spot of every object.<br>
<br>Unlike Roach Smith's collection, Baily's did not acquire national significance, and at 2100 items was less than half the size. Baily also did not study his finds, although he regularly exhibited them to the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society and the British Archaeological Association. Some were published in records of exhibits and in articles by J. E. Price. Baily was elected to the British Archaeological Association in 1865 and to its council in 1869.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1871 Baily contracted cancer of the rectum, and he died at 9 Champion Park on 4 March 1873. He was survived by his wife. His collections were sold by his executors in 1881. The arms and armour were purchased by Baron de Cosson, of Chertsey, and the collection of London antiquities was purchased by the corporation of London for &pound;650&#151;the same amount that Baily had paid. It became the foundation of the corporation's museum of City antiquities and is now incorporated within the Museum of London.<br>
