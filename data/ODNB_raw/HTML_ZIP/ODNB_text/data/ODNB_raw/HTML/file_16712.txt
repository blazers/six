<span class="headword">Lindsay,  Patrick</span>, sixth Lord Lindsay of the Byres  (1521?&#150;1589), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16704/', "John Lindsay, fifth Lord Lindsay of the Byres (d. 1563)")</script>, and his wife, Helen, daughter of John Stewart, third earl of Atholl. By a dispensation dated May 1545 he married his kinswoman Euphemia (<i>d</i>. 1580), eldest daughter of Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven, Fife, and half-sister of James Stewart, earl of Mar and later earl of Moray. In February 1546 he received a charter of the lands of Drem, and in November following his father resigned to him the lands and barony of Byres, Haddingtonshire. However, despite or perhaps because of his father's prominence, Patrick Lindsay was slow to appear on the political scene.<h2>
<a name="Protestantactivist"></a>Protestant activist</h2>A supporter of the Reformation, Lindsay joined the lords of the congregation. He was among those who fortified Perth in May 1559 following the town's declaration of its commitment to protestantism, and he answered to the regent, Mary of Guise, for this defiant action. In January 1560, along with Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, Lindsay was active in Fife in resisting the French troops called in by the regent. They laid siege to the house of Glamis, which had been fortified by an officer in the French forces named La Bastie, whom Lindsay killed in hand-to-hand combat. It was said that &#145;if we had lost Lyndsay and Grange, it would have been more hurt to us than 1000 to the French&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1547&#150;63</i>, 192&#150;3). One of the commissioners who in February 1560 negotiated the treaty of Berwick, thereby securing English aid against the French in Scotland, on 27 April Lindsay was a signatory of the band of Leith, which committed the signatories to advance the reformation of religion, expel the French from Scotland, and support the English alliance. According to John Knox, Lindsay subscribed the first <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> in December 1560. He was a member of the 1561 general assembly and directed a petition from the assembly to the privy council.<br>
<br>According to Knox, Lindsay was one of the protesters against the first mass celebrated following Queen Mary's return to Scotland in August 1561. Nevertheless, his relations with the queen were initially cordial. He took part in the campaign against George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly, in 1562, and was with the queen's forces when they defeated the earl at Corrichie on 28 October 1562. He is recorded in that year as partnering Mary in an archery match against his brother-in-law Mar and one of the queen's ladies.<h2>
<a name="DealingswithQueenMary"></a>Dealings with Queen Mary</h2>Although not a member of Mary's privy council, Lindsay was present on three occasions as one of the additional members of the augmented council which met in the summer of 1565. Said to be a favourer of the Darnley marriage, Lindsay broke from James Stewart, now earl of Moray, as the latter became increasingly hostile to the queen's matrimonial plans and eventually engaged in the overt rebellion known as the chaseabout raid. When the fifth Lord Lindsay died in 1563 his son inherited from him a long-running dispute with Andrew Leslie, fifth earl of Rothes, over the office of sheriff of Fife. This was resolved in Rothes's favour on 13 January 1565 with the proviso that Lindsay and his family were exempted from Rothes's jurisdiction. By October, however, the disturbances of the times had led to Lindsay's being made lieutenant of Fife, and it was alleged that Mary secured Lindsay's loyalty by playing on his resentment towards Rothes, who was a supporter of Moray. Lindsay was present at the meeting of the privy council on 10 October when the order of battle against Moray was laid down, and it was agreed that he was to accompany Darnley's forces in leading the battle. This did not denote any change in his religious position&#151;he had been one of the nobles who offered to stand surety for the leaders of the Edinburgh protestant activists caught drilling in July 1565 when they were brought before the court of justiciary, and he was a member of that year's general assembly.<br>
<br>Following Moray's exile in England, Lindsay was said to be one of those friendly to the banished lords. He refused Mary's invitation to attend mass on Candlemas day, 2 February 1566, and shortly afterwards he was one of the leading participants in the murder of David Riccio on 9 March. He then fled from Edinburgh, initially perhaps to Fife, then to England. Summoned with others by the Scottish privy council to appear on 19 March to answer for Riccio's murder, Lindsay was denounced rebel on 1 June, but pardoned in December.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1567 Lindsay subscribed the Stirling bond undertaking to defend Prince James, the son of Mary and Darnley, against the latter's murderers. Consequently he was discharged from his lieutenancy of Fife eight days later. He was with the confederate lords who opposed the queen at Carberry on 15 June, and when James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell, offered to settle the issue by single combat, Lindsay volunteered to take up the challenge. James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, lent Lindsay the broadsword which had belonged to his famous ancestor, Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus. However, Mary intervened, refusing to give permission for the encounter and surrendering herself to the confederate lords.<br>
<br>Having been a signatory of the order committing Mary to Lochleven, Lindsay conveyed her there and was one of her guardians during her imprisonment. On 20 July he subscribed the acts of the general assembly. With William, fourth Lord Ruthven, he was charged with securing the queen's abdication, which they achieved on the 24th. According to the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> of Sir James Melville, it was Lindsay who persuaded Mary to resign the crown, and Mary's supporters later claimed that &#145;the Lord Lyndsay, he menassit hir grace, that, gif scho wald not subscryve, he had command to putt hir presently in the towre&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1563&#150;9</i>, 532). Historians have generally accepted the truthfulness of this charge. On 29 July 1567, ostensibly acting on the queen's behalf, Lindsay and Ruthven publicly presented documents declaring that she had abdicated and appointed Moray as regent, and claimed that she had done so voluntarily. Lindsay was present at James's coronation later that day.<br>
<br>A member of the privy council following Mary's deposition, Lindsay was one of the councillors who witnessed Moray's acceptance of the regency on 22 August 1567, having been present at Lochleven a week earlier when Mary was induced to confirm Moray's appointment. Following Mary's escape from captivity, on 13 May 1568 Lindsay was with the regent's forces at Langside, where he was credited with reinforcing the right wing as it was about to give way. Lindsay accompanied Moray to the conferences held at York and Westminster between October and December 1568 to investigate the charges against Mary, and testified to the authenticity of Mary's handwriting in the casket letters. When John Maxwell, fourth Lord Herries, one of Mary's leading supporters, claimed at Westminster on 1 December that the real murderers of Darnley were the regent and his associates, Lindsay challenged him to maintain the accusation in single combat. In reply, Herries specifically excepted Lindsay from this charge. Lindsay voted against Mary's petition to divorce Bothwell on 30 June 1569.<h2>
<a name="Politicalmalcontent"></a>Political malcontent</h2>In April 1569, after Lord Herries had had an audience with Moray to discuss a possible peace between the supporters of James and Mary, Lindsay and Ruthven took him to be imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. Following Moray's assassination on 21 January 1570 Lindsay was one of the bearers of the regent's body at his funeral. During the ensuing civil war Lindsay was active on behalf of the king's party, both politically and militarily. In June 1571 forces led by Lindsay and the earl of Morton killed Gavin Hamilton, commendator of Kilwinning, and captured Alexander, fifth Lord Home, and others. Later that month Lindsay intercepted at Wemyss a quantity of gold sent on Mary's orders to the defenders of Edinburgh Castle. In September Lindsay captured George, fifth Lord Seton after a skirmish in the High Street of Edinburgh. That month the house of Byres, with Lindsay's wife inside, was surrounded by Marian troops from Edinburgh Castle, and cattle were taken from his estates by the queen's supporters. In the following year Lindsay was with the king's men at Leith, and as lieutenant repelled an attack by Marian forces. At this time he was said to be one of those most opposed to a peace, at least one on terms the queen's supporters would accept. In October 1572 he was elected provost of Edinburgh, a position which he held until 1576, and on 24 November he voted for Morton at the convention which chose the latter as regent. Lindsay became sheriff of Fife in February 1574, following Rothes's resignation. In September 1575 he was one of the Scottish signatories to an agreement reached at Foulden, Berwickshire, formally resolving the dispute over a fray which had erupted at an Anglo-Scottish day of truce on 7 July, in which Sir George Heron, the deputy warden of the English middle march, along with several other Englishmen, had been killed.<br>
<br>By 1577 Lindsay's support for Morton was waning&#151;in July that year Robert Bowes reported that John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl, Ruthven, Lindsay, and others had confederated themselves by oath for maintenance of the king&#151;and a year later Lindsay was seen as having &#145;become colonel of the malcontents&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;81</i>, 295). He was an active supporter of Morton's removal from power, and attended the convention in March 1578 which accepted the latter's resignation as regent. A member of the council appointed to manage affairs until parliament could meet, he signed the order of 3 May 1578 that James should remain in Stirling under the care of the second earl of Mar. On 17 June he opposed the sending of an embassy to England to negotiate an amity and league for mutual defence. In July he protested against Morton's holding of a parliament at Stirling, on the grounds that it was not a free parliament; for this he was warded in Stirling. He was invited to attend the meeting in October of the general assembly, which was unhappy with Morton's handling of ecclesiastical policy. On 1 December 1579 he was appointed a commissioner for the reformation of the University of St Andrews, and on the 9th he was appointed heritable bailie of the regality of the archbishopric.<br>
<br>During Morton's temporary return to power, Lindsay initially adhered to the opposing faction surrounding the royal favourite Esm&eacute; Stewart, seigneur d'Aubigny, who was granted the dukedom of Lennox in March 1580. After Morton's arrest that December on charges of complicity in Darnley's murder, and his subsequent execution on 2 June 1581, Lindsay was no happier with the regime which succeeded. In September 1581 he left court, allegedly saying that &#145;but yet this sworde and buckler hath helped to dryve the Frenche men furthe of Scotland, and I fear yt muste be imployed to that use agagne&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1581&#150;3</i>, 52). He signed the bond that resulted in the Ruthven raid, the ultra-protestant coup which culminated in the seizure of the king's person in August 1582, and he was part of the administration which followed. On 26 October he was formally nominated a member of the privy council, in place of the eleventh earl of Crawford. After the king's escape from the Ruthven raiders in June 1583, Lindsay fled to England. Subsequently he returned to Scotland and took part in the plotting whereby William Ruthven, now earl of Gowrie, hoped to recover power. Arrested in April 1584 and warded in Blackness Castle, it was rumoured that he would follow Gowrie to the block, but he was released following a further change of regime in November.<br>
<br>Lindsay died on 11 December 1589 at Struthers Castle, three miles south of Cupar, Fife. His wife had died in June 1580. Their son <a name="cosubject_16701"></a><span class="headword">James Lindsay</span>  (1554&#150;1601), <span class="occ">courtier and royal administrator</span>, succeeded as seventh Lord Lindsay of the Byres, and by a contract dated 9 May 1573 had married Euphemia (<i>d</i>. in or after 1605), daughter of Andrew Leslie, fifth earl of Rothes. No doubt the union was intended to help resolve the dispute between their two families over the sheriffdom of Fife. They had two sons and four daughters. James Lindsay was appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber in September 1580, during his father's period in Lennox's circle. On 18 January 1594 he was made a privy councillor. He died on 5 November 1601, when his heir was his elder son, John.<br>
