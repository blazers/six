<span class="headword">Montagu,  David Charles Samuel</span>, fourth Baron Swaythling  (1928&#150;1998), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 6 August 1928 at 8 Grosvenor Crescent, Westminster, London, the eldest son and heir of Stuart Albert Samuel Montagu, third Baron Swaythling (1898&#150;1990), and his first wife, Mary Violet Levy (<i>d</i>. 1983). His father was briefly a partner in the family firm Samuel Montagu &amp; Co., but his principal interests were his herd of English Guernsey cattle and road safety: a Liberal peer, his foremost legislative achievement was to make rear lights on bicycles compulsory.<br>
<br>David Montagu was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied English literature, having tried law and economics but found them too dull. Upon graduation in 1949 he reported for work at the family firm founded by his great-grandfather in 1853. He was interviewed by Louis Franck, the abrasive Belgian who ran the City merchant bank: &#145;He saw this young pip-squeak who he thought had been born with a silver spoon in his mouth&#146;, Montagu recalled; &#145;his first words to me were: &#147;you have no future in banking&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 20 May 1998). Goaded by Franck's disdain, Montagu applied himself to mastering the business of merchant banking, and in 1954 he was admitted to the partnership. It was while a trainee in Paris in 1951 that he met and married, on 14 December, Christiane Fran&ccedil;oise (Ninette) Dreyfus, with whom he had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>While Franck focused on the firm's traditional foreign exchange and bullion trading, Montagu developed its corporate finance, capital markets, and investment management activities. Among his achievements were the invention of the split-level investment trust and a pioneering presence in the Euromarkets. When Franck retired in 1970, Montagu became chairman and chief executive at the early age of forty-one. Between his arrival at Samuel Montagu &amp; Co. in 1949 and his departure in 1973, the staff grew from sixty to 4000.<br>
<br>The firm's dynamic expansion and its new activities necessitated greater capital, so in 1967 Montagu persuaded Midland Bank to take a minority shareholding, at the time a radical departure for a merchant bank. Six years later Midland purchased full ownership and Samuel Montagu &amp; Co. became its merchant banking subsidiary. In view of the family tie, Montagu was offered the non-executive chairmanship for life, a banking equivalent to allowing the ancestral family to live on as tenants in a wing of a house acquired by the National Trust. Montagu was outraged and resigned: &#145;I wanted nothing to do with it&#146;, he fulminated; &#145;a greater insult has never been offered&#146;  (personal knowledge). He was immediately recruited as chairman and chief executive of Orion, a joint-venture &#145;consortium bank&#146; established in 1970 by six of the major banks, including the National Westminster, Chase Manhattan, and the Royal Bank of Canada, to operate in the burgeoning Eurobond and syndicated loan markets. Montagu took the helm at a particularly turbulent moment in the international financial markets, but under his leadership Orion prospered and became a powerful and profitable player in petro-dollar recycling and the Eurobond market. Orion's success inspired its shareholders to develop their own Euromarket activities, resulting in mounting conflicts of interest, a common fate of the consortium banks. But the shareholders refused to accept Montagu's advice that one of them should buy out the others, leading to an acrimonious parting in 1979. His strategic judgement was vindicated when the Royal Bank of Canada became sole owner eighteen months later.<br>
<br>After Orion, Montagu worked briefly and unhappily for the American brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and then for J. Rothschild Holdings, where he had charge of Ailsa Investment Trust. In 1988 he became chairman of the tobacco giant Rothmans International, a position he retained until a few months before his death in 1998. He succeeded as fourth Baron Swaythling in 1990.<br>
<br>Swaythling was much sought after as a director of banks, investment trusts, and companies, including London Weekend Television (LWT), Bovis, and the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. His friend the broadcaster John Freeman, whom Montagu helped to establish LWT, once described him as &#145;someone I trust entirely, a man with whom I would go tiger shooting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 2 July 1998). He was often consulted by government and was a member of the Bank of England's board of banking supervision and its inquiry into the collapse of Barings.<br>
<br>Swaythling was a man of fastidious, civilized tastes who described himself as &#145;a lobster-eating Jew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 2 July 1998). He was an art collector, a theatre lover, a connoisseur of fine wine and cigars, a keen bridge player, and an excellent shot. He was an active supporter of a variety of causes, among them the National Theatre, and was president of the Association for Jewish Youth. But his passion was racing. He kept a string of racehorses near his Newmarket home, a house called The Kremlin. The high point of his racing career was in 1979, when his horse Zongalero finished second in the Grand National. He was proud to be a founder member of the British Horseracing Board. He had a sharp wit, which was a delight for companions but did not endear him to its targets, first and foremost commercial bankers. On one occasion when asked to justify his first-class airline ticket by an Orion shareholder he replied, &#145;I'm afraid a private jet wasn't available&#146;  (personal knowledge). His tongue made him a few enemies, but they were greatly outnumbered by friends, and he inspired remarkable admiration and affection among colleagues. He possessed a genuine <i>joie de vivre</i> and instilled a sense of fun and excitement in every undertaking in which he was involved. Lord Swaythling died at his home, 14 Craven Hill Mews, Westminster, London, on 1 July 1998, and was succeeded by his son, Charles Edgar Samuel Montagu.<br>
