<span class="headword">Touchet,  James</span>, third earl of Castlehaven  (<em>bap. </em>1612, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66794/', "Mervin Touchet, second earl of Castlehaven (1593&#150;1631)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth (1592&#150;1622x4), daughter and heir of Benedict Barnham, alderman of London. In 1631, after a trial in the House of Lords, his father was executed for &#145;unnatural offences&#146; involving gross sexual misconduct against his second wife, Lady Anne Brydges, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stanley, daughter of the fifth earl of Derby, and her daughter from her first marriage, Elizabeth Brydges (1614/15&#150;1679), who had been thirteen years old when she was married to James, her stepbrother, in 1628. Arrangements in the Touchet household were not conducive to filial piety, and James was instrumental in bringing his father to justice. He succeeded to the Irish earldom of Castlehaven with the swing of the headsman's axe, but most of his father's English patrimony was lost to Lord Cottington. The title Baron Audley of Hely was granted to him in 1633, but in so far as the creation was virtually a restoration to an ancient dignity it lay outside the power of the crown alone to make it, and it was not confirmed until parliament passed an act in 1678.<h2>
<a name="Militarycareer"></a>Military career</h2>Castlehaven began a military career on the continent before returning home in 1638 by royal command and attending the king to Berwick. After another season on the continent the earl was in Ireland at the outbreak of the rising there on 23 October 1641. When he offered his assistance to put down the rising, his treatment at the hands of the protestant lords justices Sir William Parsons and Sir John Borlase contributed to the growing mistrust between the Catholics of the pale and the Dublin administration, helping to propel the former into the rebel camp. Indicted of high treason in May 1642, Castlehaven was placed in the custody of one of the sheriffs of Dublin, whence he fled the following September, having learned of an intention to place him under more strict confinement in the castle. He later professed that he had intended to go to England via France, but in the event he was persuaded to accept a command as general of horse under Sir Thomas Preston in the army of the confederate Catholics when he came to their headquarters at Kilkenny. Suspicious of the confederate organization, the Ulstermen believed that Castlehaven was, in effect, an Ormondist plant, and that his &#145;escape&#146; had been contrived as a means of opening a line of communication between Dublin and Kilkenny whereby Ormond, Castlehaven's kinsman by marriage, might reach an agreement with the confederates.<br>
<br>Castlehaven served with Preston at the capture of Burros Castle on 30 December 1642, and of Birr on 19 January 1643. Entrusted with the execution of the articles of capitulation of the latter, he conveyed the garrison safely to Athy. On 18 March he commanded the horse at the battle of Ross, where the confederates were defeated by Ormond. When Preston, having rallied his forces, sat down before Ballynekill, Castlehaven intercepted and routed a strong detachment sent to raise the siege under Colonel Crawford near Athy on 13 April. Although he was primarily concerned with the defence of Kilkenny, he was sent into Munster later in the spring to counter Murrough O'Brien, earl of Inchiquin, scourge of the rebellious south-west. On 4 June he fought with the forces of Sir Charles Vavasour near Castlelyons, inflicting very heavy losses and capturing Vavasour himself, as well as his cannon and baggage. Having returned to Kilkenny, he was afterwards employed in reducing the outstanding fortresses in co. Kildare between the Barrow and the Liffey, but his further progress was stopped by the conclusion of the cessation, in promoting which he had taken an active part, on 15 September.<br>
<br>Having helped in the shipment of Ormond's Irish forces to assist the king in England, in 1644 Castlehaven commanded a force of 6000 foot and 600 horse sent to Ulster to aid Owen Roe O'Neill against the New Scots commander there, Major-General Robert Monro, who refused to recognize the cessation. After suppressing a rising in co. Mayo <i>en route</i>, Castlehaven joined up with O'Neill at Portlester, and towards the end of July both armies marched towards Tanderagee. Failing to engage Monro, the campaign fizzled out in the trenches before Charlemont, ending in mutual recrimination when Castlehaven withdrew his forces, their supplies exhausted, into co. Cavan. Having seen his army into winter quarters, and having arrived at Kilkenny, he found the supreme council in a state of consternation owing to the defection of Lord Inchiquin and the surrender of Duncannon fort by Sir Laurence Esmonde. Castlehaven served as a volunteer under Preston at the siege of Duncannon, and was present at its rendition on 18 March 1645. The truce with Inchiquin drawing near its expiration, Castlehaven was sent with 5000 foot and 1000 horse into Munster, speedily reduced all the castles in the baronies of Imokilly and Barrimore, and, having wasted the country up to the walls of Cork, sat down before Youghall, &#145;thinking to distress the place&#146; into a surrender  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). But the town was relieved, leaving Castlehaven little to do beyond destroying the harvest until placing his army in winter quarters. He returned to Kilkenny in late November. He was one of the signatories to the contract made with Rinuccini on 19 February 1646, agreeing not to conclude a peace until provision had been made for the full exercise of the Catholic religion. Predictably, however, he supported the subsequent first Ormond peace, and was even employed by the lord lieutenant in a futile attempt to persuade the nuncio to accept it. Castlehaven then accompanied Ormond on his withdrawal to Dublin, bearing the sword of state before him at his entrance on 13 September.<br>
<br>Castlehaven lent his support to Ormond's negotiation with the Westminster parliament, and had already left Ireland by the time the English commissioners arrived. He went to France, and was present at the battle of Landrecies, fighting in Prince Rupert's troop. Afterwards he retired to St Germain, and remained in attendance on the queen and prince of Wales until returning with Ormond into Ireland. When the lord lieutenant secured his second treaty with the confederates in January 1649, Castlehaven took command of the horse, and with an army of 5000 foot and 1000 cavalry he was sent to reduce O'Neill's outposts in the Irish midlands. After seeing off a challenge for his command from Lord Taaffe, whom some members of the general assembly plainly preferred to Castlehaven, the earl was on hand to share in the ignominy of Ormond's defeat at Rathmines in August 1649. He signed the order for the defence of Drogheda, and, having been entrusted with a special command over forces destined for the relief of the southern towns, he succeeded on 6 October in throwing 1500 men into Wexford, a dubious achievement which enabled the commander of that place, Synnot, to break off his correspondence with Cromwell. A few days later Castlehaven forced Ireton to raise the siege of Duncannon. He was then appointed governor of Waterford, with 1000 men under his command to reinforce the garrison, and was refused admittance by the citizenry.<br>
<br>In the following year Castlehaven was appointed commander-in-chief of the Leinster forces, taking the field in March with some 4000 men. But he was too weak to confront Hewson, contenting himself with watching his movements, and when Kilkenny fell to Cromwell at the end of the month, he withdrew to the borders of King's county, and in June made an unsuccessful attempt to relieve Tecroghan, which &#145;was by the confession of all parties, even of the enemy, allowed to be the gallantest action that had been performed since the beginning of the war&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Afterwards finding it impossible to keep an army together, he granted commissions for horse and foot to all who applied for them, whereby, although managing to keep up an appearance of war, he gave to it the character of a freebooting campaign, which caused as much harm to his own party as to the enemy. When the citizens of Limerick refused to co-operate with the lord lieutenant, Castlehaven did what he could to deflect Ormond's growing determination to quit the kingdom, but to no avail. Having appointed Clanricarde his lord deputy, and Castlehaven commander-in-chief in Munster and Clare, Ormond sailed for France in December. The approach of Ireton persuaded the townsmen of Limerick of the need to co-operate with the confederate command, enabling Castlehaven to undertake a successful offensive into co. Kerry. Early in the following year he crossed the Shannon into co. Tipperary, but the object of the expedition was frustrated by the plundering propensities of his officers, and, being compelled to retreat before Ireton and Broghill, he recrossed the Shannon at Athlone. He failed to prevent Ireton from besieging Limerick, and the capitulation of that city on 27 October, followed by the loss of Clare, forced him and Clanricarde into Iar Connaught. But with the situation growing daily more desperate, he was on 10 April dispatched by the lord deputy into France for the purpose of soliciting aid to enable the latter to maintain &#145;a mountain war&#146;  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="Continentalcampaigns"></a>Continental campaigns</h2>Castlehaven reached Brest after a sharp encounter with an English vessel in the channel, and was posted to St Germain. Having failed to obtain the supplies required, he was granted permission to enter the service of the prince of Cond&eacute; in the war of the Fronde. He was appointed to the command of a regiment of horse and was present at the fight in Faubourg St Antoine on 2 July 1651; after quitting Paris with Cond&eacute;, he was taken prisoner at Comercy by Turenne. Thanks to the intervention of the duke of York he was shortly afterwards exchanged and was placed at the head of the Irish regiments fighting for the French crown in the war with Spain, holding the rank of <i>mar&eacute;chal-de-camp</i>, or major-general. He was present at the sieges of Rocroi in 1653 and of Arras in 1654, the relief of Valenciennes and the capture of Cond&eacute; in 1656, the siege of St Guislain and the relief of Cambrai in 1657, and the battle of the Dunes in 1658. He returned to England with Charles II. On the outbreak of the war with the Netherlands, Castlehaven served as a volunteer in several naval actions, and in June 1667 landed at Ostend with 2400 recruits for the Old English regiment, of which he was appointed colonel. His men were used to strengthen the garrisons at Nieuport, Lille, Courtrai, Oudenarde, and other places. He returned to England with the conclusion of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle on 2 May 1668. He took a commission in the Spanish army in 1676, serving in the trenches before Maastricht&#151;&#145;by much the bloodiest siege that I ever saw&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)&#151;and was at the siege of Charleroi in 1677 and the battle of Mons in 1678. After the treaty of Nijmegen, he returned to England. On 19 or 20 June 1679 Castlehaven obtained a settlement for his second marriage&#151;to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1720), apparently daughter of one Graves&#151;within just over three months of burying his first wife.<br>
<br>In 1680 Castlehaven published his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, in which he described the Irish wars, discussing at length the various cessations and treaties between Charles I and Charles II, their lord lieutenant, and the Catholic rebels in Ireland during the 1640s. The publication at the time of the crisis over the Popish Plot was somewhat inopportune, although not without calculation. The earl's dedication of the book to the king was described as presumptuous. The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> sparked a violent controversy when the lord privy seal, Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey, stung by the imputations of treason and disloyalty which Castlehaven laid at the door of New English protestants in Ireland, replied to Castlehaven's recollection of the events of the 1640s in <span class="italic">A Letter from a Person of Honour in the Country</span>. Anglesey's own recollections were felt to have calumnied the late king, and at the request of Charles II the duke of Ormond replied to Anglesey in turn. When Anglesey retorted in another <span class="italic">Letter</span>, the duke appealed to the privy council to appoint a committee to examine the matter, which eventually ended with Anglesey's dismissal and the transfer of the privy seal to Lord Halifax. Coincidentally, about the same time there was a move to have Castlehaven struck off the Irish establishment. His one reliable source of post-Restoration income in jeopardy, in the spring of 1683 it was rumoured that the earl intended to join several other noblemen in volunteering to take up arms in the &#145;holy war&#146; with the Turks in Hungary. However, he appears never to have set out, and died at Kilcash, co. Tipperary, his sister's house, on 11 October 1684, and was succeeded by his youngest brother, Mervyn&#151;the second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27575/', "George Touchet (d. before 1689?)")</script>, a Benedictine monk, having been expressly passed over in the act formally restoring the barony of Audley in 1678.<br>
