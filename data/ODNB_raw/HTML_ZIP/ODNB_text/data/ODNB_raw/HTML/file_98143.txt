<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fletcher,  Yvonne Joyce</span>  (1958&#150;1984), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born on 15 June 1958 at 4 Kingsettle Estate, Semley, Wiltshire, the eldest of four daughters of Michael Henry James Fletcher, timber feller, and his wife, Queenie May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Troke. Brought up in Semley, where she sang in the church choir, she was educated nearby at Gillingham School, in Dorset. Her parents said that from the age of three she had dreamt of becoming a police officer, but she was very short&#151;five foot two and half inches&#151;and the requirement in the Metropolitan Police for women recruits was five foot four inches. She was turned down several times, but continued to reapply. Eventually Scotland Yard's recruiters, impressed by her determination and drive, relented and gave her a dispensation to join. Enrolled on 14 March 1977 as the 4257th female officer in the Metropolitan Police, she was stationed, after training, at Bow Street, London, on 7 July 1977. She had the shoulder number 341CB. Having secured some distinction as Britain's then smallest police officer, she was regarded by her colleagues and superiors at Bow Street, where she was a home beat officer, as experienced, professional, and mature. Nicknamed Super Fletch, she lived in Grove Avenue, South Harrow, Middlesex, and was unofficially engaged to Police Constable Michael Liddle, a doctor's son from Norfolk.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1984 Fletcher was part of a unit deployed outside the Libyan People's Bureau, Tripoli's diplomatic mission in St James's Square, London, to police a demonstration against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The protest was mounted against a background of deteriorating relations between the UK and Libya. In March MI5 warned police that bureau staff had discussed &#145;revolutionary action&#146; against Gaddafi's opponents and within weeks there were bomb attacks in London and Manchester. Gaddafi supporters were arrested, questioned, and deported as police began guarding prominent opponents and the Foreign Office asked for assurances from Libya that the violence would stop.<br>
<br>As the date of the demonstration approached the bureau tried unsuccessfully to get it banned and then warned the police there would be counter-measures. On the day of the demonstration about seventy demonstrators were kept back behind barriers. Fletcher was standing some 50 yards from the bureau, facing the protesters, when shots were fired about 10.18 a.m. and she collapsed, hit in the right side of the back by a single round. Rushed to Westminster Hospital, she died from extensive internal injuries to the abdomen two hours later. Eleven demonstrators were also wounded.<br>
<br>Police reinforcements sealed off the square and evacuated thousands of office workers at the start of an eleven-day siege. Britain severed diplomatic relations with Libya, but after international negotiations thirty Libyans from the bureau were allowed to fly out of Britain. None was questioned because all had been given diplomatic cover.<br>
<br>Fletcher's police hat lay in the road at St James's Square throughout the siege. It was retrieved in time for it to be placed on her coffin at her funeral, which took place at Salisbury Cathedral on 27 April 1984, attended by 600 Metropolitan Police officers. The service was followed by a private cremation. On 10 May 1984 an inquest jury at Westminster coroner's court returned a verdict of unlawful killing.<br>
<br>One of the legacies of Fletcher's death was a national recognition that the death of police officers who sacrificed their lives on duty deserved to be publicly and permanently marked. The film director Michael Winner wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (21 April 1984) calling for a memorial to Fletcher. There was an immediate public and media response and donations flowed in. A Portland stone memorial, four feet high, with a granite face, was erected on the pavement in St James's Square on the spot where she fell. It was unveiled on 1 February 1985 by the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Winner enlarged his campaign to include other officers who had been killed in the line of duty and this led to the creation of the Police Memorial Trust. Ten years later, in 2005, a national memorial to 1600 officers killed on duty was unveiled by the queen at the junction between The Mall and St James's Park.<br>
<br>No one has been convicted for Yvonne Fletcher's shooting. Claims were later made that the murder was the work of CIA or Israeli agents firing from another building with the intention of discrediting the Libyans but the police were satisfied the shots came from the bureau. Scientists said two Sterling sub-machine guns had been used and five witnesses reported seeing a gun barrel pointing from the bureau. A police search of the empty building uncovered 4300 rounds, seven handguns, including one used to kill a Libyan journalist, and magazines for a Sterling. MI5 archives show that the day before Fletcher's death the bureau asked Tripoli whether staff should shoot the protesters if the demonstration could not be stopped; on the night before the demonstration Tripoli authorized the bureau to open fire on the demonstration. Attempts to solve the murder were stymied as Libya became an international pariah, linked increasingly to terrorism in Europe and the Middle East. In July 1999 Libya publicly accepted &#145;general responsibility&#146; for the murder and in November 1999 paid compensation to Fletcher's family, as diplomatic relations between Britain and Libya were resumed. British police teams visited Tripoli to investigate the murder, but came back empty-handed, and in 2006 the UK and Libya secretly signed an agreement, during trade talks, that no one would be extradited for Fletcher's murder. In October 2009 Colonel Gaddafi personally apologized for the murder during a television interview, but offered no fresh help to bring convictions.<br>
