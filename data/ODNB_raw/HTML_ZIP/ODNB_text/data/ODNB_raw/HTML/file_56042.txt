<span class="headword">Craig,  Edward Thomas</span>  (1804&#150;1894), <span class="occ">communitarian and journalist</span>, the son of Joseph Craig and his wife, Elizabeth, was born in Manchester on 4 August 1804 and was baptized at the Gravel Lane Wesleyan Methodist chapel, Salford, on 7 October that year. Following the death of his father, Craig, then aged four, was sent to live with his paternal grandparents at Lancaster. One of his earliest memories was of Luddite prisoners being delivered to Lancaster Castle. The death of his grandmother meant that in 1815 he returned to Manchester, to live at Hanover Square with his mother's family, who were strict Calvinists. He was present at the Peterloo massacre in 1819. Craig recalled that:<blockquote>My maternal grandparents were rigid Puritans, and looked upon scientific books as the instruments of Satan for the ruin of souls, so that I had to read them in secret and during the night &hellip; The result of reading this class of books was a spirit of scepticism and inquiry into everything pertaining to human nature, and the relations of capital and labour, and made me dissatisfied with both. (Craig, <span class="italic">The First Example</span>, 18&#150;19)</blockquote>Craig joined the Manchester Mechanics' Institution in 1825 and was &#145;an eager reader of works bearing on the human mind and on political economy&#146;  (Craig, <span class="italic">The First Example</span>, 18). By now he was working in the fustian trade, and in 1828 founded a Fustian Manufacturing Society based upon profit-sharing principles. He then organized a co-operative society (the Utility Society) in Salford and began to promote co-operation throughout the industrial towns of Lancashire. The Utility Society met in rooms belonging to his future father-in-law (who has not been identified), whose daughter he married in July 1833; they had at least one son, Francis. As a result of the Utility Society's discussions the Salford Sunday School and Social Institute was formed. Influenced by William King's <span class="italic">Co-Operator</span> (1828&#150;30) and William Thompson's <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth most Conducive to Human Happiness</span> (1824), Craig became secretary of a co-operative society in Manchester and helped to organize the first Co-operative Congress in Manchester on 26 and 27 May 1831. He later became editor of one of the early northern co-operative journals, the <span class="italic">Lancashire Co-Operator</span> (later the <span class="italic">Lancashire and Yorkshire Co-Operator</span>).<br>
<br>Craig's most important involvement with co-operation came when he was invited by John Scott Vandaleur to run his estate at Ralahine near Limerick on co-operative principles, Vandaleur seeing this as the way of ending the outbreaks of peasant violence that had troubled the estate. By November 1831 Craig had formulated his plans for Ralahine, which he set out in <span class="italic">The First Example of Profit Sharing and Home Rule</span> (n.d.). There was no single governor, master, or steward, and the estate was to be managed by a committee elected by members of the community. Education was to be available to all (in a school run by Mrs Craig); all profits were to belong to the members, and labour notes were to be introduced. The aims of Ralahine were:<blockquote>the acquisition of common capital &hellip; the mutual assurance of members against the evils of poverty &hellip; the attainment of the greater share of the comforts of life than the working classes now possess &hellip; the mental and moral improvement of its adult members, and the education of their children. (p. 23)</blockquote>Craig's early time in Ireland was uncomfortable: &#145;A stranger myself, and moreover a <i>sassenach</i>, I was on one occasion struck with a stone, and had an ominous letter, with a coffin crudely drawn on it, laid in my way&#146;  (ibid., 11). Nevertheless, the community had two successful years before its sudden collapse, after Vandaleur had gambled away the estate and disappeared. Craig published his account of his experience in <span class="italic">The Irish Land &amp; Labour Question, Illustrated in the History of Ralahine and Co-operative Farming</span> (1882).<br>
<br>On leaving Ralahine, Craig was invited by Lady Noel Byron to organize an industrial school at Ealing Grove, Middlesex, &#145;where labour in the garden or workshop should alternate with intellectual culture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Phrenological Magazine</span>, 58). He remained there until the end of 1835. Craig next became assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Star in the East</span>, and at the same time ran, together with his wife, a successful infants' school. From 1840 until 1856 Craig lectured on co-operation, psychology, and phrenology, in which he had become interested after hearing J. G. Spurzheim lecture in 1827. Craig was also interested in animal magnetism and thought-reading. He occasionally conducted his own experiments and described them in his journal the <span class="italic">Annals of Mesmerism</span>. According to his own account, in 1843 he was earning &pound;25&#150;&pound;30 a week from lecturing. But ill health forced him to give this up, and after a spell working in the Post Office in 1853 he became principal of the Rotherham and Mexborough Mechanics' Institute.<br>
<br>Craig spent most of his later life as a journalist and by 1878 had been editor of six newspapers including the <span class="italic">Brighton Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Leamington Advertiser</span>, and the <span class="italic">Oxford University Herald</span>. He was also something of an inventor and in 1873 won a silver medal at the Cambridge Exhibition of Arts, Industry, and Manufactures for the greatest number of inventions in the catalogue (twenty-seven). An advocate of fresh air, abstinence, and vegetarianism, he also published <span class="italic">The Science of Life</span> (n.d.) in which he extolled the benefits of massage. Craig's health began to fail in his later years, though this did not stop him from contributing papers to the <span class="italic">American Socialist</span>, or from being one of the nine members who in June 1884 inaugurated the Hammersmith branch of the Democratic Federation (afterwards the Social Democratic Federation). In February 1885 he published a reminiscence of Peterloo in <span class="italic">The Commonweal</span>. It appears that he suffered a stroke early that year, but, though frail, he was able to attend the 1893 Co-operative Congress in Bristol. Craig died at his home, Ralahine, 10 Andover Road, Hammersmith, London, on 15 December 1894. His son, Francis, was in attendance, and he was also survived by his wife.<br>
