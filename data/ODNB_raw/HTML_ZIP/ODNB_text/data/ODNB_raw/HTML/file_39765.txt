<span class="headword">Chapman,  Thomas</span>  (1683?&#150;1747), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, is of unknown place of birth and parentage. The only information available about his pre-theatrical life is provided by a star-struck descendant, George D. Ford, whose <span class="italic">These were Actors</span> is a fictionalized and unsubstantiated account of the Chapman family. Chapman may, as Ford claims, have been invalided out of the army, having been wounded in the eye at Blenheim. The earliest theatrical playbill featuring his name is dated 14 May 1723 and records his sharing a benefit performance of <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields with two other actors. That same year he also played at Drury Lane and at William Pinkethman's Southwark fair booth. This sets the pattern for the first few playing years of his life; from 1724 to 1727 he performed as stock actor (and perhaps also some kind of administrator) for John Rich at Lincoln's Inn during the theatrical season and, over the summer, played in booths at fairs.<br>
<br>Noted for his skill in playing low comics&#151;&#145;a most excellent actor &hellip; in all Shakespeare's clowns, in petulant would-be-wits, fops and fantastics, and many other absurd humorous characters&#146;  (Davies, 1.165)&#151;Chapman nevertheless always aspired to serious, tragic roles. Rich indulged him in his yearning for tragedy&#151;to no good effect, according to Thomas Davies. For the season of 1727&#150;8 he was promoted to playing major roles. He created a number of new performances, including the Beggar in John Gay's <span class="italic">Beggar's Opera</span>, and continued to shine in comic parts: Osric in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Shamwell in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">Squire of Alsatia</span>, Brisk in William Congreve's <span class="italic">Double Dealer</span>. Ford claims that Chapman married a woman named Nora Lynch and had two children with her, whom he does not name. Theatrical documentation, however, refers only to his alliance with Hannah Chapman (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1756), who may have been his first or second wife; she is first mentioned in 1729, when playbills record that she played Faunia to Chapman's Polixene in the anonymous, droll <span class="italic">Dorastus and Faunia</span> at William Bullock's booth in Bartholomew fair. From 1729 onwards Chapman was cast in major roles at Lincoln's Inn Fields; from 1732 he also performed in Covent Garden. Sometimes Rich made him act in both places on the same evening: on one night he performed the Beggar in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at Covent Garden, and Southampton in John Banks's <span class="italic">The Unhappy Favourite</span> in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He continued to act in summer fairs when the theatrical season ended, stopping for good when booths were forbidden in 1744 (though they were reallowed from 1746).<br>
<br>Besides being an actor Chapman was also manager in charge of a number of booths at Bartholomew fair&#151;first with Lacy Ryan, John Laguerre, and Jacob Hall in 1734, then with William Hallam in 1736, and finally with John Hippisley and Laguerre in 1739. In 1730 he completed a theatre in Richmond on the site where Pinkethman's playhouse had stood. There he was manager and principal performer until his death, taking such noted parts as that of Harry Wildair in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span> but also indulging his yearning to play serious roles &#145;to the destruction of his own property, as well as of all propriety&#146;; among other ill-chosen parts &#145;he strutted in the robes of King Richard III to empty benches&#146;  (Davies, 1.167). The theatre was successful however and in the 1740s performances were extended out to Twickenham. In addition Chapman kept billiard tables near where he lived in Bow Street; his apprentice marker and general errand boy was Edward (Ned) Shuter (1728?&#150;1776), whom he taught to act and brought to the stage. In 1735 Chapman was still close enough to Rich to be made one of the first members of the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks but in 1739 their association came to an end; in that same year he also recorded that he was having health problems and found himself &#145;in danger of losing one of my eyes&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). From 1739 to 1741 he played at Drury Lane, taking on several roles that he had not performed before, including Touchstone in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> and Marplot in Susanna Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span>, &#145;in which he excited as much good laughter as ever shook a merry audience&#146;  (Davies, 1.167). Having returned to Covent Garden in 1741 he was once more cast in major roles, such as Bayes in <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span> by George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, though he was increasingly plagued with ill health. On 14 July 1747, having completed the 1746&#150;7 season at Covent Garden, he died of a fever at Richmond, where he was buried on 17 July. After his death his widow, Hannah Chapman, took over the management of the Richmond theatre.<br>
