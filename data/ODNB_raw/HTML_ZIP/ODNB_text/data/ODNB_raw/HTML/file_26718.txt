<span class="headword">Stuart,  John</span>  (1743&#150;1821), <span class="occ">Gaelic scholar and botanist</span>, was born at the manse, Killin, Perthshire, on 31 July 1743, the son of James Stuart (1700&#150;1789), a minister in the Church of Scotland, and Elizabeth Drummond. Educated at Edinburgh University, he was licensed by the city's presbytery on 27 February 1771, presented to the parish of Arrochar, Dunbartonshire, by Sir James Colquhoun in October 1773, and ordained on 12 May 1774. He was translated to Weem, Perthshire, on 26 May 1776, and to Luss, Dunbartonshire, on 1 July 1777.<br>
<br>Stuart was one of the leading Gaelic scholars of his time. His father had published a Gaelic translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> for the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in 1767 and was engaged with a translation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> at the time of his death. Stuart supervised the completion of the first two volumes of his father's work and himself made the translation of the remaining <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> books, which were published as volume 3 of the whole in 1801. On 24 July 1792 he married Susan Macintyre (1768&#150;1846), the daughter of Joseph Macintyre, minister of Glenorchy. They had four children, including Joseph, who later became minister at Kingarth, Isle of Bute. In 1795 Stuart was awarded the degree of DD by Glasgow University and in 1796 he published a second, revised, edition of his father's translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>.<br>
<br>Stuart's valuable services earned him the thanks of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland on 28 May 1819, and a gift of &pound;1000 from the lords of the Treasury in the following year. Aside from his interest in the Gaelic language, Stuart was also a devoted student of botany and lichenology, and identified many of Perthshire's rare alpine plants. He died on 24 May 1821 at Luss, where he was also buried. He was survived by his wife, who died on 7 July 1846.<br>
