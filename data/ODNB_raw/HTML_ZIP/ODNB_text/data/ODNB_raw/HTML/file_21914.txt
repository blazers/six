<span class="headword">Perceval,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1558&#150;1620), <span class="occ">administrator and lexicographer</span>, was the eldest son of George Perceval (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1600), a gentleman of Nailsea and Sydenham, Somerset, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Bampfylde of Poltimore, Devon. His life was the focus of a family history commissioned by his descendant the first earl of Egmont, which confused many of the details of his career. Perceval was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1571, and at Lincoln's Inn in 1576. He married as his first wife Joan (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1585), daughter of Henry Yonge of Buckhorn Weston, Dorset, who was probably the widow of John Royall and brought him no dowry. His father, upset by the match, disinherited him, and he spent four years in Spain. He presumably returned to England at the outbreak of war in 1585, after which he taught for several years at his old school. He also drafted a Spanish-Latin-English dictionary and grammar with the assistance of some of the Armada prisoners, whose ransom he helped to negotiate. His book <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Hispanica</span> (1591) was dedicated to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, presumably in hope of preferment; but about 1594 he joined the secretariat of the earl's rival Sir Robert Cecil upon a recommendation from his relative Roger Cave.<br>
<br>Despite his linguistic abilities, Perceval had little to do with Cecil's diplomatic activities, although he later boasted of his speedy translation of a captured Spanish dispatch in 1598 which proved that Henri IV of France was about to abandon his alliance with England. His chief role was the handling of petitions for leases of the estates of minors whose wardship fell to the crown, many of which crossed Cecil's desk both before and after he became master of the court of wards in 1599. Perceval's family claimed his post had been worth &pound;2000 a year, probably an exaggeration, but he is known to have been offered generous gratuities by suitors, and he procured leases of several wardships for himself and his relatives. In addition to his main role, he occasionally supervised Cecil's building works.<br>
<br>Perceval was returned to parliament in 1604 as MP for Richmond, Yorkshire, probably through the intervention of the borough's recorder and former MP Cuthbert Pepper, surveyor of the wards. Cecil (newly elevated to the Lords) may have intended to use him as one of his unofficial spokesmen in the Commons: in April 1604 Perceval suggested a compromise over the king's proposal to retitle his realms &#145;Great Britain&#146;. However, in the same speech he declared his opposition to &#145;an inundation, or deluge&#146; of Scottish courtiers, a remark unlikely to endear him to the king. This may explain why Perceval was not subsequently used as a &#145;man of business&#146;, although he and Sir Walter Cope were sent to reassure the house when rumours of James's assassination circulated on 22 March 1606. Surprisingly, he played little part in the 1610 debate on the great contract, which proposed to abolish the court of wards.<br>
<br>Perceval lost his main income on his master's death in 1612, which may explain why he sold his Somerset estate in the following year. However, he continued as clerk registrar of the wards until 1614, when he was dismissed by the new master, William, Lord Knollys. Called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1615, he may have intended to practise as a lawyer, but in 1616 he was sent to Dublin as clerk to the fledgeling Irish court of wards, a post he held until his death at Dublin on 4 September 1620. He was buried in St Audoen's Church, Dublin, where his monument stated he had died in his sixty-ninth year; he was probably somewhat younger, as he only entered Merchant Taylors' as a schoolboy in 1571. He had three sons (all of whom died young) and two daughters by his first marriage; his second, to Alice, daughter of John Sherman of Ottery St Mary, Devon, produced two sons and two daughters. His youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21913/', "Sir Philip Perceval")</script>, inherited the estate at Liscarroll, co. Cork, which he had bought in the last years of his life, and founded an Anglo-Irish dynasty.<br>
