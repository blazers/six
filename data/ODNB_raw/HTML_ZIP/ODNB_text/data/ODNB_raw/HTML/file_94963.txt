<span class="headword">Ferguson,  George Ekem</span>  (1864&#150;1897), <span class="occ">surveyor and colonial agent</span>, was born on 14 July 1864 at Anomabu, in the British west African colony of the Gold Coast, the surviving twin son of Robert Archibald Ferguson, a commercial agent for A. and F. Swanzy, and his wife, Amelia. His parents were Fante, and devout Methodists: his father was a Methodist lay preacher in retirement. Ferguson attended the local Wesleyan school and then from the age of eleven the Wesleyan boys' high school in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He returned to the Gold Coast in 1879, worked for two years as a schoolteacher, and then joined the civil service, where his shorthand writing skills were usefully employed. He served as a junior clerk in the governor's office, and was among several African officials who accompanied the new governor, Sir Samuel Rowe, to Prasu in 1881 at a time when the still powerful inland state of Asante threatened to invade the colony.<br>
<br>Ferguson's interest in cartography attracted official attention when he produced in 1884 a map showing the ethnic divisions of the Gold Coast protectorate. That same year he was entrusted with a mission to arbitrate between the peoples of Krobo and Akwamu, which resulted in the latter state coming under British protection. Ferguson's surveying skills were further developed by his work with the British&#150;German boundary commission of 1886, which defined the eastern frontier of the Gold Coast with the German colony of Togoland. In 1889 he was sent at government expense to London where he studied mining, metallurgy, assaying, and surveying at the Royal School of Mines, from which he graduated with a first-class certificate.<br>
<br>On his return to the Gold Coast in 1890 Ferguson became increasingly trusted with political work at a time when the British were intent on safeguarding the trade of the northern interior. Ferguson's knowledge of languages (he spoke Fante and Ga, to which he added both Hausa and Mossi; he could also read French) meant that he could travel without an interpreter, while as a skilled surveyor and geologist he was one of the best scientifically qualified people in the colony. Employing him was more effective and considerably cheaper than using a European officer. As an African he could travel and collect information without exciting the same degree of suspicion that might attach to a European. The trust placed in Ferguson and several other well-qualified west Africans at this time indicates that in an age when race was becoming increasingly significant in British colonial affairs there were still senior officers who continued to recognize merit and ability in Africans.<br>
<br>In October 1890 Sir Frederic Hodgson, the colonial secretary and acting governor, sent Ferguson to negotiate a treaty with the state of Atebubu, which was anxious to secure British protection. The following year he was sent on an expedition to Akyem Abuakwa, which also sought to be free of Asante control. During 1893&#150;4 his activities were focused on the neutral zone, a rectangular block of territory astride the confluence of the rivers Volta and Daka over which, in 1888, the British and Germans had agreed not to exercise exclusive influence. However, by the early 1890s both powers, the Germans more than the British, had been trying to assert greater commercial control over the area, while the French had imperial ambitions to penetrate from the east. Ferguson again visited Atebubu in late 1893 in order to help establish a garrison and to sign treaties of friendship and free trade. At the same time he collected intelligence on the deployment of Asante military forces. Ferguson's view was that, if necessary, Asante should be prevented from interfering with British trade in the interior. This helped influence a change in official thinking and resulted in the British invasion of Asante in 1896. Ferguson's minor role in these operations involved helping to construct the fort and to survey the conquered Asante capital of Kumase. Ferguson's reports and precise maps of the north provided detailed information on topography, flora and fauna, peoples, languages, and cultures. This achievement was recognized by the Royal Geographical Society's award in 1894 of the Gill memorial grant, and a gold watch, for his services to exploration.<br>
<br>In 1897 Ferguson was a member of a British military expedition sent to the north-west region in order to show the flag and to make treaties of protection with states threatened by the freebooting armies of Samori Tour&eacute;. The expedition was attacked at Wa by Samori's army and during the retreat, on 7 April 1897, Ferguson was wounded and then killed. He was buried at Wa. His British companion, Lieutenant F. B. Henderson, wrote of the &#145;irreparable loss the Colony has sustained by the death of Mr. George Ferguson &hellip; I have lost a valued friend and the Colony an invaluable servant&#146;  (Arhin, x). Sir William Maxwell, governor of the Gold Coast, praised Ferguson's &#145;scrupulous fidelity&#146; and wrote that his &#145;work both as an explorer and as a political agent proved to be of the highest value&#146;  (ibid., xi).<br>
<br>Ferguson was one of a growing number of well-educated Africans who, in the late nineteenth century, served as British colonial agents. At the same time he was an African patriot who supported the extension of the British empire in Africa. Among officials in the Gold Coast, white and black, Ferguson was exceptional. He worked for most of the last six years of his life without any leave. His qualities persuaded the governor, Sir William Brandford Griffith, in 1893 to recommend, against the hesitations of the Colonial Office in London, that an annual four-year scholarship be provided for a gifted African. Ferguson was a devoted and loyal servant of the colonial state with whose interests he closely identified, and this was recognized by an official pension to his widow, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sey, and their three children.<br>
