<span class="headword">Cairnes,  William Elliot</span>  (1862&#150;1902), <span class="occ">army officer and military writer</span>, was born at Galway on 18 September 1862, to an old family of Scottish descent, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4345/', "John Elliot Cairnes (1823&#150;1875)")</script>, economist and professor at University College, London, and his wife, Eliza Charlotte, daughter of George Henry Minto Alexander. In 1872 Cairnes's father moved to Blackheath, having lived nearby since 1870; Cairnes attended Blackheath proprietary school, University College School (1877&#150;9), and the International College, Spring Grove, Isleworth, a boarding-school emphasizing modern languages and science, which started with Cobdenite idealism but declined into indiscipline and violence.<br>
<br>Cairnes entered the army through the militia &#145;back door&#146;, presumably attending a crammer. He was commissioned lieutenant in the militia (Royal Irish Rifles) on 16 September 1882, became lieutenant 3rd dragoon guards on 14 May 1884, and was transferred to the South Staffordshire regiment on 21 May; he was moved to the Royal Irish Fusiliers on 16 July, and served with the 2nd battalion at several home stations. He married in June 1884 Mary (Mamie) Elizabeth, daughter of M. McClelland of Glendarragh, co. Londonderry; she was to survive her husband, with one daughter, Dorothy Elliot. Having been promoted captain on 21 May 1890, Cairnes was adjutant of the 1st volunteer battalion, Yorkshire light infantry, at Wakefield, from 31 March 1897 to 30 March 1902. This prevented his going to South Africa with his regiment, whose regular battalions both served in the South African War.<br>
<br>Cairnes's army career was undistinguished, with neither active service nor time at a staff college. In 1899 he was approaching middle age, and was stuck training part-time soldiers in a northern industrial town, while his fellow officers took their chances of distinction and dysentery. However, the South African War offered him new opportunity, as a part-time military journalist and writer. From November 1899 to April 1901 he was &#145;military correspondent&#146; of George Newnes's prestigious, influential, but unprofitable Liberal evening paper, the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, contributing daily articles on the war, considered among the best of their kind. The war aroused immense public and media interest, which, after the British blunders and defeats of 1899, turned to angry criticism and recrimination.<br>
<br>Cairnes responded with <span class="italic">An Absent-Minded War</span> (1900), published pseudonymously as a shilling cardback, its cover printed as if tied with red tape. The book was a polemical indictment of the &#145;system&#146;, the War Office&#151;&#145;that shrine of mediocrity and incompetence&#146;  (Cairnes, <span class="italic">Absent-Minded War</span>, 70)&#151;, jobbery, the Staff College and its graduates, conspicuous uniforms and pipeclaying, and the failure to train and prepare for war. It alleged that there had been &#145;an army of lions led by ignoramuses&#146;  (ibid., 146), and criticized Buller, Warren, and other generals, but praised Roberts and Kitchener. It demanded army reforms for an &#145;up-to-date fighting machine&#146;  (ibid.). Much in it had been and was being asserted by others, and arguably it was the work of a resentful outsider. Yet it was vivid, sarcastic, quotable, and fitted the public mood, and because of it Cairnes became &#145;a well-known writer of books on military subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 123). Controversial, it provoked a pseudonymous reply by a retired colonel, James Edward Goodwyn, <span class="italic">Unfounded Attacks on British Officers Made in &#145;An Absent-Minded War&#146; &hellip; A Refutation</span> (1901), which, however, agreed with some of the criticisms in Cairnes's book. A German translation of the latter was published in 1903.<br>
<br>Cairnes's pseudonymous <span class="italic">Social Life in the British Army</span> (1900) was less polemical and more descriptive, and warned against admitting as officers men of lower social rank. His pseudonymous <span class="italic">The Army from within</span> (1901) repeated some of his earlier criticisms, his warning against socially inferior officers, and his call for reforms. It also warned against &#145;hedgerow&#146; defence by civilian riflemen against invasion. With Roberts's reputation at its zenith, Cairnes published a eulogistic and derivative biography, <span class="italic">Lord Roberts as a Soldier in Peace and War</span> (1901), praising him as &#145;the greatest living soldier&#146;  (Cairnes, <span class="italic">Lord Roberts</span>, 331). Cairnes's <span class="italic">The Coming Waterloo</span> (1901) was in the genre of purposive future-war fiction which had flourished since George Tomkyns Chesney's <span class="italic">The Battle of Dorking</span> (1871). It described a war in 1903 in which Britain&#151;her army decisively improved after the South African War&#151;allied with Germany and Austria and defeated France and Russia. Its message was the need for army reform, the inconclusiveness of seapower, the dominance of infantry firepower, and the limited role of <i>arme blanche</i> cavalry. Cairnes's books earned &#145;widespread acclaim&#146;  (Spiers, <span class="italic">Late Victorian Army</span>, 308). He also contributed to the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, <span class="italic">Harper's Magazine</span>, and occasionally <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He was a clever draftsman, able to illustrate his articles, and he patented several inventions.<br>
<br>In April 1901 a committee on officer education and training was appointed, with Aretas Akers-Douglas (later Viscount Chilston) chairman and Cairnes secretary. In their report in March 1902 the committee stated that Cairnes's knowledge, tact, and ability had greatly facilitated their inquiry. Cairnes was also secretary to the military court of inquiry into the remount department. These duties and his writing taxed his strength. He died of pneumonia at 15 Bury Street, London, on 19 April 1902. His army career was undistinguished: his notable achievement was as a military writer at the time of the South African War. Through his writings he was among those who contributed to the army reforms during and after that war, and so to the quality of the British expeditionary force in 1914.<br>
