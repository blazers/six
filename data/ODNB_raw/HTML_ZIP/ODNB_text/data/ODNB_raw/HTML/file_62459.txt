<span class="headword">Christian,  Ewan</span>  (1814&#150;1895), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 20 September 1814 in London, the seventh of the nine children of Joseph Christian (<i>d</i>. 1821) and his wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1822), daughter of John Scales of Thwaitehead, Lancashire. His father's family was of Manx and Cumbrian origin; it included a number of clergymen and Christian was himself intended for ordination. Orphaned at an early age, he was educated in the junior department of Christ's Hospital, Hertford. He married on 6 July 1848 Annie (<i>d</i>. 1895), daughter of William Walker Bentham of Rochester, a kinsman of Jeremy Bentham. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>Christian was articled to Matthew Habershon in 1829 and studied at the architectural school of the Royal Academy. He provided illustrations for Habershon's <span class="italic">The Ancient Half-Timbered Houses of England</span> (1836), a book that was highly critical of Pugin. In 1836 he joined the office of William Railton (from 1838 the architect to the ecclesiastical commissioners) with whom he worked on drawings for the Houses of Parliament competition. After a period with the Norwich architect John Brown, and a visit to Rome and Naples in 1841, he set up independently in London in 1842.<br>
<br>Although Christian was never exclusively an ecclesiastical architect, churches became his speciality. His first, Hildenborough, Kent (1843&#150;4), won in competition, as were most of his early works, showed considerable design flair in providing uncluttered preaching space. Christian considered his restorations of Austrey, Warwickshire, Scarborough, Yorkshire (from 1844), and Wolverhampton (from 1850) to have established his career and, along with his appointment as consulting architect to the Lichfield Diocesan Church Building Society (and probably the good offices of Railton), these led in 1851 to his appointment as architect to the ecclesiastical commissioners, an influential post that he occupied until his death.<br>
<br>Christian was a prolific architect with over 2000 completed works to his name; many of these were church restorations carried out in his capacity as architect for the ecclesiastical commissioners, but included ninety new churches, many parsonages, schools, and private houses. Much of his work, often completed within very tight budgets, appears off-the-shelf, spare, and uninspiring, but he was capable of fine and original designs. Among his finest churches (in addition to Hildenborough) were Wickham Bishops, Essex (1849&#150;50), Kenilworth, Warwickshire (1851&#150;2), Leyland, Lancashire (1854&#150;5), St Peter's, Rochester (1859&#150;60; dem.), St Mark's, Leicester (1870&#150;72, and perhaps his best), Sunk Island, East Riding, Yorkshire (1875&#150;7), and St Matthew's, Cheltenham (1878&#150;9). Notable restorations include those of Carlisle Cathedral (1853&#150;7) and Southwell Minster (1848&#150;8); of his secular buildings, the National Portrait Gallery, London (1890&#150;95), may be singled out.<br>
<br>Christian attained great prominence within his profession. He was elected vice-president (1880) and then president (1884) of the Royal Institute of British Architects; he received the institute's gold medal in 1887. He acted as consulting architect to a number of bodies, notably the Incorporated Church Building Society and (in 1887) the charity commissioners (for whom he provided the most comprehensive survey of Wren's London churches ever carried out). He was a member of the board of judges for Admiralty and War Office competitions and assessor to many others including Edinburgh (1872) and Liverpool (1884) cathedrals. His partners were James K. Colling, Henry Purday, and his cousin J. H. Christian; well-known architects who passed through his office included Axel Haig and W. D. Caroe. He was J. L. Pearson's brother-in-law and a close friend and executor of S. S. Teulon.<br>
<br>Christian was highly regarded for his competence, integrity, and technical skills, but his reputation began to wane even during his lifetime, and his obituaries convey the impression of a man widely admired but not considered outstanding&#151;a &#145;safe man&#146; but &#145;in no sense a heaven-born genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">Building News</span>, 1 March 1895). He was a devout and energetic evangelical Anglican who favoured auditory rather than highly ritualistic designs and who demanded strict economy on work carried out for the ecclesiastical commissioners, a body much distrusted by the high church. It was his low-church credentials more than his abilities as an architect that helped fuel adverse criticism, a situation already clear at the time of the Liverpool Cathedral competition (1884), when highly placed critics openly queried his decision. A century was to pass before Christian's reputation began to recover from this critical legacy.<br>
<br>Christian died at his home, which he designed himself, called Thwaitehead, 50 Well Walk, Hampstead, London, on 21 February 1895 and was buried at Hampstead cemetery on 25 February.<br>
