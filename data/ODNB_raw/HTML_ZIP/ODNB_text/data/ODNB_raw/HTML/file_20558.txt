<span class="headword">O'Donnell <span class="st"> [&Oacute; Domhnaill]</span>, Sir  Niall Garbh</span>  (1568/9&#150;1626?), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the eldest son of Conn O'Donnell (<i>d</i>. 1583) and his wife, Rose, daughter of Shane (Se&aacute;n) O'Neill, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20550/', "Calvagh O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell")</script>. Conn, who appears to have been married previously, had eight sons and at least two daughters. In 1567 the then lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, had delivered Lifford and Finn fortresses to Conn, and Niall was probably born in Finn Castle. By his marriage to Nuala (Fionnghuala), sister of Red Hugh O'Donnell, Niall had at least two children, Neachtan and Manus (killed at Benburb in 1646), but his wife deserted him in 1600. In 1602 he was reported to be contemplating marriage with the dead Hugh Maguire's sister, the widow of Sir Arthur O'Neill. Whether or not they married, he seems to have had more than the two children. Niall was three years older than Red Hugh, his father's first cousin and his own foster-brother and brother-in-law. But rivalry between their two houses went back to the 1540s, when the English government had in effect partitioned Tyrconnell. The English favoured Calvagh's branch, represented now by Niall.<br>
<br>Red Hugh having in 1592 established himself as lord of Tyrconnell and taken over Lifford, from which to challenge O'Neill (Turlough Luineach) at Strabane, made both Niall and Hugh mac Hugh Dubh of Ramelton, &#145;sinnsear sleachta D&aacute;laig&#146; (&#145;the senior O'Donnell&#146;), submit. Niall, although his ambitions were thwarted and he had lost Lifford, served Red Hugh faithfully in the war, up to 1600. O'Donnell sent him to Hugh Maguire's aid in 1592; thereafter he saw much service in Connaught and presumably shared in the victory of the Curlews (the poet who after 1632 wrote his elegy extols his valour shown in Connaught and in Ulster). But on 3 October 1600 he with his three brothers, Hugh Boy, Donal, and Conn Og, went over to the English at Lough Foyle. Sir Henry Docwra, the English commander in north-west Ulster, had offered him and his heirs the lordship of Tyrconnell, and his grant was enrolled on 18 March 1601. The lord deputy, Mountjoy, knighted him. Fearing Red Hugh's wrath, he joined Docwra before his further demands for the traditional O'Donnell overlordship of Inishowen and of Sligo were met.<br>
<br>The timing of Niall's defection, in wartime and with the English enemy established on the Foyle, leaves him open to the charge of treason. The disgusted Nuala promptly left him; she went into exile in 1607, died in or after 1617, and was buried in Louvain. Niall kept Docwra victualled and gained for him Lifford (8 October 1600), which, it is thought, Red Hugh had put under his charge. The nastier side of his nature was revealed when he and his men in a drunken fury upon an old grudge murdered Neachtan O'Donnell, Niall's own uncle and a man of great authority with O'Donnell. On 24 October Red Hugh's brothers, Rury and Manus, engaged him and his men. Manus was fatally wounded and Niall narrowly escaped death at Rury's hand. He took Donegal Franciscan friary (31 July 1601) as a base for attacking Ballyshannon Castle, which for Mountjoy was the key to bridling O'Donnell as the Blackwater fort bridled Tyrone. However, O'Donnell attacked Niall, who lost his brother Conn Og and 300 men. He retreated to Magherabeg friary but at the end of October Red Hugh, informed of the Spanish landing at Kinsale, broke the siege to go south. Niall won over MacSweeney Banagh, whose keep commanded Killybegs harbour, and while Ballyshannon fell to the English (25 March 1602), he also secured Castlederg. The historian John Lynch blamed Niall for allowing Docwra's soldiers to kill the aged bishop of Derry, Redmond O'Gallagher. In August, Niall provisioned Mountjoy at Augher, with cattle seized in co. Tyrone and in Breifne O'Rourke. He also destroyed Enniskillen and garrisoned the monasteries of Devenish and Lisgoole.<br>
<br>Docwra, while acknowledging Niall's ambitious and refractory nature, pleaded with Mountjoy to honour his promises to one who had proved indispensable to the success of the Foyle operation. But Mountjoy thought Rury O'Donnell the man to keep Tyrconnell at peace. The outraged Niall seized Rury's cattle and had himself inaugurated O'Donnell (1603). (The four masters, knowing Rury to be tanist, do not acknowledge the inauguration's validity.) He then came to Derry, where he was arrested, but he broke free with the cattle, 7000 head, which Docwra by prompt action recovered. Still Niall accompanied Mountjoy to London, where Tyrconnell was divided. Rury was made earl, with grant of the major part of the county, but with reservation of Ballyshannon (which, Docwra complained, had been won by himself) and 1000 acres adjoining to Sir Henry Folliott. Niall was apportioned the lands along the Finn that he had held in the time of Sir Hugh O'Donnell. English army officers received grants, which included ecclesiastical lands, while the crown reserved to itself the right to build forts. All this left three people much dissatisfied: the earl of Tyrconnell, Niall Garbh, and Docwra.<br>
<br>By 1604 Niall had so strengthened his hand that the earl was forced to retreat to the pale. At Strabane in 1605 Lord Deputy Chichester gave judgment in the disputes between Tyrconnell and Niall and between the latter and Tyrone (over the lands to the south of Lifford, Cin&eacute;al Moain or Moentacht): he awarded 43 quarters of land in Glenfin and the Moentacht to Niall, made Tyrconnell recognize his sub-chiefs as freeholders, and reserved Lifford (although it had not been excepted from Tyrconnell's patent) to the crown. Niall continued in dispute with Tyrconnell and in August 1606 deposed that the earl and Cuconnacht Maguire were planning to seize the northern garrisons. Chichester in December bound Tyrconnell and Niall in recognizances to accept his own decisions in their disputes. Sufficient amity prevailed for Niall to serve under Tyrconnell at the siege of Doe Castle in March 1607, Niall being severely wounded.<br>
<br>By 1608 Chichester was ready to double Niall's grant in Glenfin and Moentacht but now Niall was accused, even by his two brothers, of instigating Sir Cahir O'Doherty's rebellion. Tyrconnell's mother, In&iacute;on Dubh, included the brothers with Niall's son Neachtan among the plotters. Niall's complicity was, however, probably limited. Neachtan, a student first of St John's College, Oxford, and then of Trinity College, Dublin, had been taken hostage by Chichester for his father's good behaviour. Then, straight after the revolt, Niall sought a patent for both Tyrconnell and Inishowen, promising to bring in O'Doherty's head. The rebellion over, on 14 June Niall and his brothers were arrested, as was Sir Donal Ballagh O'Kane, all charged with complicity in the insurrection. They were brought to Dublin in the <i>Tramontana</i>, the pinnace that had brought Niall to Holyhead with Mountjoy. Marshal Wingfield had given Niall protection and a jury failed to convict him. Despite that, Niall, Neachtan, and O'Kane were sent to the Tower of London. Niall died there, aged fifty-seven, probably in 1626; Neachtan is said to have died in the Tower, although there is no trace of him after 1623. In the plantation his lands were sequestrated, but it appears that a request made by him in 1613 that the rents he claimed be devoted to the support of his surviving sister and the maintenance of his children at school, and a similar request from O'Kane, were honoured by Chichester. Brave if overbearing, Niall had striven by every means to secure Tyrconnell with all its chieftains' ancestral rights and lived to regret joining the English camp. Through his son Manus he was ancestor of the O'Donnells of Newport, co. Mayo, the Leitrim line stemming from his brother Hugh Boy and the Austrian and Spanish lines from his other brother Conn Og.<br>
