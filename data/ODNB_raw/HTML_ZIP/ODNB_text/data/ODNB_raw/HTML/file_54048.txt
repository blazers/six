<span class="headword">Stokes,  Jonathan</span>  (1755?&#150;1831), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of Jonathan Stokes (<i>d</i>. 1807?), was probably born at Chesterfield, Derbyshire. His family had originated in Worcester, where his father was a nurseryman; Stokes was living in the city in 1775, perhaps as an apprentice, and he went from Worcester as a medical student to Edinburgh University in 1778. In 1780 he acted as clerk to Francis Home, the clinical professor at Edinburgh Infirmary, and in 1781 was a corresponding member of the Society of Antiquaries (Scotland). He was also president of the Royal Medical Society, to which he presented several papers, including one on foxglove therapy; he also presented a paper to the Natural History Society on the nomenclature of fossils. Stokes gained his MD in 1782 with a thesis on dephlogisticated air; a fellow student was James Edward Smith, later founder of the Linnean Society. Stokes became friendly with the younger Linnaeus in London during May&#150;August 1781, when Stokes was cataloguing the late John Fothergill's Upton garden for auction. He began practice in 1782 in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, his name being a late addition to the 1783 <span class="italic">Medical Register</span>. At this time he was also gathering plants in France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Austria, returning to London by 15 May 1783, when he was Joseph Priestley's guest at a Royal Society meeting.<br>
<br>On 10 June 1784 at Dronfield, Derbyshire, Stokes married Ann Rogers (<i>bap</i>. 1 April 1755, <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1840), a minor poet and friend of Anna Seward, &#145;the Swan of Lichfield&#146;. Stokes was already acquainted with William Withering, to whom his MD thesis was dedicated, and by 1783, he had joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59220', "Lunar Society of Birmingham")</script>. The relationship of Stokes and Withering, which developed into friendship, was long-standing, and both personal and professional. Their collaboration began when Stokes wrote the historical preface on digitalis to Withering's <span class="italic">Account of the Foxglove</span> (1785), as well as contributing the details of six patients he had treated using Withering's method. The two men remained on good terms when Stokes went to live in Shrewsbury (1785&#150;6), and until his move to Kidderminster, Worcestershire (by August 1787). Withering then planned an enlarged second edition of his <span class="italic">Botanical Arrangement</span> (1776), but owing to &#145;the multiplicity of his own professional engagements&#146; it was Stokes who prepared both the plates and the reference bibliography&#151;as well as adding six new plants&#151;to this second edition, the first two volumes of which appeared in 1787. However, Withering quarrelled with Stokes about the younger man's claim to a share in the new edition; he accused Stokes of retaining and mutilating over 120 of Withering's volumes, as well as not returning botanical specimens and letters. Stokes refused a lump sum in payment and demanded both royalties and a share in the copyright. The quarrel continued after Withering's death, although the books were returned in 1790. By 1788 Stokes had ended his links with the Lunar Society, whose members, except for Erasmus Darwin, appear to have sided with Withering in the dispute. On 16 February 1790 Stokes was elected as one of the first sixteen associates of the newly founded Linnean Society.<br>
<br>In 1795 Stokes moved back to Derbyshire and spent the rest of his life at New Square, Chesterfield, where he had an extensive practice. Stokes had a son, Jonathan Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1818), who also trained in medicine at Edinburgh; while one of his daughters, Honora (1791&#150;1792), was the goddaughter of Anna Seward, with whom both Jonathan Stokes and Ann Stokes were on friendly terms. Anna Seward considered that Stokes was &#145;an extremely skilful physician&#146;, soft-voiced, &#145;a man of education and the gentleman&#146;, but no public speaker. She also thought his political sentiments, as &#145;a dissenter and consequently a democrat&#146;, had harmed him, although a &#145;worthy and ingenious man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Anna Seward</span>, 3.329).<br>
<br>Stokes was an instinctive classifier; his scientific interests were many, apart from medicine. He was concerned with pneumatic chemistry, zoology, ornithology, and geology, as well as horticulture, and botany. His many European and American contacts helped him to expand both his knowledge and his collections of the flora of different areas. In 1812 he published <span class="italic">A Botanical Materia medica</span> in four volumes. His most eccentric interest was in a reformed orthography, which he used in <span class="italic">Botanical Commentaries</span> (1830), rejecting double letters and silent terminals in words, as well as apostrophes and many capital letters. <span class="italic">Botanical Commentaries</span> was his major work: however, only the first volume was published. It is clear from this book that he had travelled very widely in Britain observing and collecting plants, especially in the midlands and the north. He wrote to learned journals on topics as varied as erysipelas, sugar beet, and inoculation, as well as on his geological research. His extensive network of friends and professional acquaintances included Sir Joseph Banks, C. L. L'Heritier, D. Solander, and P. M. A. Broussonet. Stokes had his own herbarium, but his large collection of plants was sold and dispersed after his death. He died in Chesterfield on 30 April 1831 and was buried at St Mary's, Chesterfield, on 9 May; he left no will. He is commemorated by the plant <i>Stokesia</i>. His wife died about 1840.<br>
