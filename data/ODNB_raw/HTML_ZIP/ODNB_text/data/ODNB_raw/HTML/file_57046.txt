<span class="headword">Chitty,  Lily Frances</span>  (1893&#150;1979), <span class="occ">archaeologist and antiquary</span>, was born on 20 March 1893 at Lewdown, Devon, the first of three children of the Revd James Charles Martin Chitty (1865&#150;1938) and his wife, Gwen Ethlin Georgiana (1861&#150;1933), daughter of Henry Jones of Binnum Binnum, South Australia. The family moved to Shropshire in 1899 when James Chitty became rector of Hanwood, near Shrewsbury. She was educated at home with the children of local gentry families but she also learned eagerly from her two younger Wykehamist brothers. She attended Shrewsbury School of Art from 1910 to 1915 but was disappointed when she was denied instruction in technical drawing as the school valued her artistic work more highly. Though she had intended to continue her art training, she chose to take a secretarial course in London in order to make a contribution to the war effort. She was employed briefly by the General Post Office in London, but became ill and returned to Shropshire where she worked for the Women's Land Army.<br>
<br>In 1920 Lily Chitty's father became rector of Yockleton in Shropshire, where she was free to develop her interest in archaeology; she was particularly interested in prehistoric artefacts. In 1927, through Harold Peake, she was given the work of drawing bronze implements for the British Association. She became the Ordnance Survey's honorary correspondent for archaeology in Shropshire in 1924. From 1926 she was the local contact for the Ancient Monuments Board when monuments and sites were scheduled. At this time she began work on analytical card indexes to national and local archaeological periodicals and other literature. This unique database was soon consulted by many leading professional archaeologists but she generously shared it with students; it continued to be valued until the end of her life. She also prepared artefact distribution maps, some of which form an important part of Sir Cyril Fox's seminal <span class="italic">The Personality of Britain</span>, first published in 1932, though they were not acknowledged as her work until the third edition of 1938.<br>
<br>In 1938 her father died and Lily Chitty moved to Upton, Berkshire, where her brother, Derwas Chitty, was rector. After his marriage at the end of the war, she returned to a family property in Pontesbury, Shropshire, where she lived until her death. Here she resumed her position as the county's archaeological expert. It was to her that new discoveries were reported. She drew artefacts, researched and mapped find sites, published reports, and helped to improve local museum collections. Most of the 146 articles she published are reports on specific objects, but some result from investigations of Bronze Age hoards where previous records were lacking or misleading. She was commissioned by the Cambrian Archaeological Association to index <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, 1846&#150;1900, but she regretted that her scholarly, exhaustive index was edited for publication; the University of Wales awarded her an honorary MA for this work in 1957. In 1956 she was made an OBE. These honours formally recognized her life's work, but she took particular pleasure and pride in the Festschrift presented to her by colleagues in 1972 in grateful recognition of her unique role in British archaeology.<br>
<br>Lal Chitty, as she was known, retained her enthusiastic curiosity about her numerous interests until the end of her life. She was a keen botanist, read widely, and was a popular figure at the excursions and lectures provided by the learned societies to which she belonged. Her hardy constitution finally succumbed to hypothermia in January 1979 and she died at the Hillside Rest Home, near Church Stretton, Shropshire, on 8 February 1979. She was buried at Pontesbury cemetery on 15 February.<br>
