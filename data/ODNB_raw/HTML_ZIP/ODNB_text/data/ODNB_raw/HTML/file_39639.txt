<span class="headword">Mairet <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Partridge; <em>other married name </em>Coomaraswamy]</span>,  Ethel Mary</span>  (1872&#150;1952), <span class="occ">hand-weaving revivalist and author</span>, was born on 17 February 1872 at High Street, Barnstaple, north Devon, the first of three children of James Partridge (<i>d</i>. 1914), dispensing chemist of Barnstaple, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunt (<i>d</i>. 1927). She was brought up in Barnstaple and educated in north London, then briefly at the Municipal Science and Arts Schools, Barnstaple. In 1899 she was awarded the teachers' diploma in pianoforte (LRAM) from the Royal Academy of Music, London; she then found employment as a governess in London and Bonn. Returning to Devon in 1902 she met the young <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55201/', "Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy (1877&#150;1947)")</script>, a brilliant, rich, Anglo-Ceylonese geologist, who later became an art historian. They married on 19 June the same year and from 1903 to 1906 travelled in Ceylon, where Coomaraswamy carried out an official mineralogical survey, and Ethel attempted to revive native embroidery; the pair simultaneously studied and collected the indigenous arts and crafts. Their resulting definitive book, containing reports, drawings, and numerous photographs (mostly taken by Ethel Coomaraswamy), was published on their return to England in 1907.<br>
<br>In 1907 and 1910 the Coomaraswamys visited India together, adding to their art and textile collections. Their home and workplace in these years was, however, Norman Chapel near Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, where C. R. Ashbee, architect and designer, had established his Guild of Handicraft. (Fred Partridge, Ethel Mary's brother, was a jeweller at the guild.) Ashbee restored and converted the imposing chapel, which rapidly became the centre for an artistic circle, leading Janet Ashbee to recall the striking, dark-haired Ethel Coomaraswamy &#145;by night coming out like a brilliant moth in eastern plum, cherry and orange colours&#146;. At this time Ethel made her first experiments in hand-weaving.<br>
<br>By 1912 the marriage had broken down and, aged forty, Ethel Coomaraswamy built an isolated bungalow, Broadlys, on the coast near Barnstaple. It contained rooms for weaving and dyeing, where she worked alone; a Samoyed dog and occasional visitors her only company. She secured a divorce and on 28 May 1913 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62992/', "Philippe (later Philip) Auguste Mairet (1886&#150;1975)")</script>, a former draughtsman of Ashbee's and secretary of Coomaraswamy's, and fifteen years her junior. They set up workshop and home at the Thatched House, Shottery, near Stratford upon Avon; here Mairet wrote her influential treatise <span class="italic">A Book on Vegetable Dyes</span> (1916), published by Hilary Pepler, and participated in London craft exhibitions such as the &#145;Englishwoman&#146;.<br>
<br>A visit to Hilary Pepler and Eric Gill in 1916, who were at the centre of the community of artists forming the Guild of Sts Joseph and Dominic on Ditchling Common, precipitated Mairet's move to the Sussex village. Here she built Gospels, in Beacon Road, the home with weaving workshop and dye house she occupied for thirty-two years, and in which she trained over 130 people: work girls, apprentices, and, in the 1940s, student teachers.<br>
<br>In the 1920s, cloth produced at Gospels was at its simplest: plain weaves in strong, vegetable-dyed colours contrasted with undyed, natural colours using hand-spun British wools and imported cotton and silk yarns. Yardage was made into garments or furnishings, rugs and blankets were woven, and accessories such as stoles, scarves, and ties were sold. Mairet exhibited throughout the country, and orders were regular.<br>
<br>In 1931 Ethel and Philip Mairet separated, following the collapse of their venture running the New Handworkers' Gallery, in London. This changed Ethel Mairet's previously sociable and gentle character, making her austere.<br>
<br>During the mid-1930s an influx of European assistants brought more textured weave patterns to the cloth, through greater technical ability and an interest in combining high quality, hand-spun fibres with industrially produced yarns. These themes persisted until wartime shortages confined Mairet to undyed cotton or chemically dyed Welsh woollen yarns. The war curtailed her travelling which, in the 1930s, had embraced many European countries, especially Denmark, while researching her book <span class="italic">Handweaving Today, Traditions and Changes</span> (1939). That year she was created an RDI (royal designer for industry), the first woman so honoured by the Royal Society of Arts.<br>
<br>In the 1940s, reduced staff, advancing age, and an interest in craft education caused Mairet to create and hire out &#145;textile portfolios&#146;, with informative booklets, to schools and colleges. They drew on her own weavings as well as her extensive collection of world textiles which, hanging in the barn-like weaving-room, had so impressed visitors to Gospels. Ethel Mairet died in her sleep at Gospels on 18 November 1952 and was buried at Dyke Road cemetery, Brighton; she was an inspiration to the crafts movement; one who was called, by the Japanese master potter Shoji Hamada, &#145;the mother of English hand-weaving&#146;.<br>
