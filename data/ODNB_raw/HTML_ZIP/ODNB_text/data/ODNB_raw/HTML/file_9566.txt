<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  James</span>  (1742&#150;1835), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born in Inchicronan, co. Clare, Ireland, was the eldest son of William Fitzgerald (<i>b</i>. 1714), attorney, and Eliza Lynch of Rathfilad, co. Galway. He was educated at the Revd Thomas Benson's school, Dublin, and at Trinity College, Dublin (1759&#150;64), where he was made a scholar. On graduating he read law at the Middle Temple and was called to the Irish bar in 1769. He soon built up a large practice, and became a KC in 1776. Encouraged by Marcus Patterson and Colonel William Conyngham, to whom he became &#145;attached&#146;  (Sayles, 269), he purchased a parliamentary seat for the borough of Fore in 1776. Anxious &#145;not to be frequently troublesome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Parliamentary Diary</span>, 2.63), he chose carefully those occasions on which he spoke. His early interventions appertained to procedural and jurisdictional issues, but his carefully researched and legalistic observations gave his predominantly short contributions an authority which was welcomed by the castle interest with whom he sat. His defence of the embargo on Irish exports on 9 December 1777 was particularly impressive, because as well as exposing inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the arguments of its critics he defended the &#145;wisdom&#146; of recourse to such a tactic in &#145;a season of monstrous rebellion&#146;  (ibid., 3.401).<br>
<br>It is a fair measure of Fitzgerald's impact, as well as of his dislike of the penal laws, that he was entrusted on 12 March 1778 with the task of introducing legislation permitting Catholics to take long leases and to build in towns and villages. In the following year he was appointed third serjeant, following which he consolidated his reputation as a loyal castle supporter and one of the House of Commons' most skilful debaters. In 1782 he married Catherine Vesey (1759&#150;1832), second daughter of the Revd Henry Vesey, warden of Galway, and Mary Gerry, and the granddaughter of John Vesey, archbishop of Tuam. They had seven children. Fitzgerald's prospects of further political advancement seemed to have ended in 1782 when he was dismissed by the duke of Portland, but his purchase of a Commons seat for the borough of Tulsk in 1783 (an action he repeated in 1790) suggests that he deemed the set-back to be temporary, and his judgement was vindicated when he was appointed second serjeant in April 1784.<br>
<br>As second serjeant Fitzgerald reverted to the active pro-government stance he had taken in the early 1780s, and his honed, forensic rebuffs of opposition attacks on government policy earned him the appellative &#145;the silver-tongued sergeant&#146;  (Burtchaell &amp; Sadleir, <span class="italic">Alum. Dubl.</span>, 499). Understandably, the administration supported his request for promotion in the law. His target was the attorney-generalship, and he accepted the prime serjeancy as a stepping-stone in 1787. The fact that he was described in castle circles in the late 1780s as a &#145;steady, useful fr[ien]d in parliament&#146;  (Hobart list) indicates that high legal office was not an unrealistic ambition, but it was not his destiny. For reasons that are not entirely clear, Fitzgerald's relationship with Dublin Castle deteriorated dramatically in the 1790s. This led him to accept the nomination of the duke of Leinster for the borough of Kildare in 1797 and ensured that he was passed over when the solicitor-generalship fell vacant in 1798. More significantly, he was dismissed as prime serjeant in January 1799 when he refused to support the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. He intimated initially that his opposition derived from &#145;the reluctancy the bar had to the question&#146;  (Stanhope MSS). His stand won him the applause of the Irish bar, which continued to give him the precedence in court over the attorney-general and solicitor-general he had enjoyed as prime serjeant, but his call &#145;for a sacred adherence to the constitution of 1782&#146;  (McDowell, 694) and his attempt in February 1799 to derail the union by advancing a bill to regulate any future regencies indicate that his grounds for opposition were wider.<br>
<br>Following the ratification of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> Fitzgerald represented Ennis in the imperial parliament from 1802 to 1808 and from 1812 to 1813. At Westminster his primary focus initially was legal issues until his hostility to Pitt prompted him to become one of the four &#145;great manufacturers of Irish legislature [<i>sic</i>]&#146;  (Malcomson, 409). This also attests to his disillusionment arising out of the failure of the imperial parliament to accord Ireland greater attention. His decision to resign his seat in 1808 in favour of his eldest surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9591/', "William Vesey-Fitzgerald, Baron Fitzgerald and Vesey (1783?&#150;1843)")</script>, politician, was partly determined by this. Indeed, he would have left politics at this point if he could have secured the attorney-generalship or mastership of the rolls. Neither came his way, and following his decision in 1813 to vacate Ennis for his son he retired. Two years later his son's request for a peerage for him was denied, but when he felt unable to accept the offer of ennoblement in 1826 his wife was created Baroness Fitzgerald and Vesey of Clare and of Inchicronan. Fitzgerald died at his home, Herbert House, Booterstown, co. Dublin, on 20 January 1835, three years after his wife, who had died on 3 January 1832 in Dublin. Their youngest son, <a name="cosubject_9559"></a><span class="headword">Henry Vesey Fitzgerald</span>, Baron Fitzgerald and Vesey  (1786&#150;1860), <span class="occ">dean of Kilmore</span>, was born in Dublin on 19 December 1786. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, from October 1802, and was appointed dean of Emly in 1818. He married, on 7 September 1825, Elizabeth O'Grady (<i>d</i>. 1834), daughter of Standish O'Grady and Mabella Ryver of co. Limerick. He was appointed dean of Kilmore in 1826 and succeeded to the barony on his brother's death in 1843. He died on 30 March 1860 at Danesfort, co. Cavan; the title became extinct.<br>
