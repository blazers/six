<span class="headword">Chalmers family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1736&#150;1876), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietors and printers</span>, established in Aberdeen what became the largest printing and publishing business in the north of Scotland in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The family's prominence was founded on the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal</span>, among other newspapers and magazines, and on their succeeding as printers to the town and university of Aberdeen, in which capacity they were responsible for at least 40 per cent of works printed in Aberdeen from the 1730s to the end of the eighteenth century. The company remained the major regional printer and newspaper publisher during much of the nineteenth century, during which it faced markedly increased competition.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64304"></a><span class="headword">James [ii] Chalmers</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1713, <em>d.</em> 1764), <span class="occ">printer and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born in Aberdeen and baptized on 8 January 1713 at Dyke, Moray, the eldest surviving son of James [i] Chalmers (<i>bap</i>. 1686, <i>d</i>. 1744), professor of divinity at Marischal College, Aberdeen (1728&#150;44), and his cousin Jean Chalmers. He was apprenticed to James Nicol, printer to the town and university of Aberdeen, and thereafter, it is frequently stated, he continued his training in the office of John Watts, the respected London printer  (Keith, 73). On Nicol's retirement in May 1736 Chalmers immediately made successful application to the town council to become its official printer, and shortly afterwards he was confirmed as printer to Marischal College. He also became official printer to the commissioners of supply for the county of Aberdeen; until 1752 his was the only printing house in the city. On 13 March 1739 he married Susan or Susanna Trail (1720&#150;1791), daughter of James Trail, Church of Scotland minister at Montrose; they had seven children, including <a href="#cosubject_64305">James [iii] [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5026/', "Alexander Chalmers (1759&#150;1834)")</script>, literary critic and biographer. In November 1740 Chalmers's petition to the town council to become precenter of the East Church of St Nicholas was accepted. Contemporary sources state that in autumn 1745 Chalmers, a committed Hanoverian, produced some news sheets and that his printing shop and equipment were damaged by Jacobite sympathizers. In July 1746 he was appointed commissioner for the forfeited estates of Hallhead and Esslemont.<br>
<br>In January 1748, from his Castlegate premises, Chalmers launched the (then) weekly <span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal</span>, the first newspaper published north of Edinburgh and still extant in the late twentieth century as the <span class="italic">Press and Journal</span>. In 1797 the extension of the title to the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal and General Advertiser for the North of Scotland</span> reflected its success and commercial utility. Its avowed aim was respectability, and impartiality in reporting events. It had no enduring eighteenth-century rival, though Douglas and Murray's <span class="italic">Aberdeen Intelligencer</span> (1752&#150;7) offered some competition. Pressure from the <span class="italic">Journal</span>, however, and protests upheld by the commissioners of supply over costs incurred in having to place advertisements in two newspapers, forced the cessation of the <span class="italic">Intelligencer</span>. In addition to his role as a newspaper publisher Chalmers produced works such as the 1762 edition of George Buchanan's <span class="italic">Rerum Scoticarum historia</span> (ed. James Man) for local booksellers; in his official capacity as university printer he also printed Alexander Gerard's influential <span class="italic">Plan of Education in Marischal College</span> (1755). Otherwise, his presses were given over to pamphlets on religious or civic subjects. He died in Aberdeen on 25 August 1764 and was buried at St Nicholas's Church.<br>
<br>Shortly after James [ii] Chalmers's death his widow announced that the business would be continued by her son <a name="cosubject_64305"></a><span class="headword">James [iii] Chalmers</span>  (1742&#150;1810), <span class="occ">printer and publisher</span>. He was born in Aberdeen on 31 March 1742 and was educated (but did not graduate) at Marischal College between 1755 and 1757, with the aid of a Liddel bursary. He then entered the family business, for which he had been trained in London and Aberdeen. On 22 March 1769 he married Margaret Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1818); they had seven daughters and five sons, including James [iv] (1775&#150;1831), later printer of the <span class="italic">Dundee Advertiser</span> (1801) and <a href="#cosubject_64306">David [<i>see below</i>]</a>. James [iii] faced greater business competition than his father and witnessed a marked increase in printing and publishing activity in a city that more than doubled in size from the 1750s to a population of 35,000 in 1811. Like his father he was not overly given to risky speculation; while more ambitious local printers attempted editions of the poets and Enlightenment texts James Chalmers &amp; Co. (imprint adopted 1770) largely continued in its preferred, secure role as printers for the town council. Occasionally it adopted the conservative approach of publishing by subscription, and it remained the dominant local and regional printing business. As the owner of what was regarded as the most lucrative newspaper in Scotland James [iii] was a member of the Narrow Wynd and other respectable friendly societies. In 1787 he met Robert Burns, who described him as &#145;a facetious fellow&#146;  (Burns).<br>
<br>In the same year Chalmers began one of several unsuccessful new publishing ventures when he launched the <span class="italic">Northern Gazette</span>, which soon failed because of the burden of the stamp duty, and later reappeared as the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Magazine</span> (1788&#150;91). Even the political preoccupations of the 1790s failed to provide sufficient stimulus to carry into print the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Courier</span>, due to have been published by Chalmers in partnership with two local booksellers. More successful was the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Almanack</span>, which first appeared in 1771 and sold throughout the north of Scotland. This annual finally ceased, with the 1955&#150;6 edition, as the <span class="italic">Northern Year Book</span>. Chalmers's printing shop also provided stock for the chapbook trade, and several such works were produced by the company itself. Chalmers also acted as a local agent for newspapers published elsewhere. In 1803 he began a papermaking business with Alexander Brown, Aberdeen's principal bookseller, owner of the stamp office, and future tory provost, who in 1795 had married Chalmers's daughter Catherine. Contacts between Brown and Chalmers were undoubtedly of mutual benefit: the Chalmers family undertook most of the printing for Brown's many local publishing ventures. Notwithstanding the investment in steam-driven machinery the paper mill failed and in 1807 it closed. The first sustained challenge to the newspaper dynasty appeared in 1806 in the form of the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Chronicle</span>, though even its radical politics failed to draw any reaction at the time from the then stolidly neutral <span class="italic">Journal</span>.<br>
<br>James [iii] died in Aberdeen on 17 June 1810 and was buried at St Nicholas's Church; he was survived by his wife, who died on 14 August 1818, &#145;in her seventieth year&#146;. The business was continued by their second son, <a name="cosubject_64306"></a><span class="headword">David Chalmers</span>  (1778&#150;1859), <span class="occ">printer and publisher</span>, who was born in Aberdeen on 19 October 1778. He was educated at Marischal College, and then began to work with his father on the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal</span>. On 27 February 1812 he married Ann Lamb Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1870), with whom he had seven sons and seven daughters. Under David Chalmers's control the business underwent significant changes, including a move to new premises at Adelphi Court, Aberdeen, in 1813 and the introduction of steam-powered presses for newspaper work about 1830. In other respects little changed and a considerable amount of civic printing was still undertaken. The political persuasion of the <span class="italic">Journal</span> became clearer with its support for tory interests in the 1832 election. That same year the <span class="italic">Journal</span> claimed the highest circulation of any newspaper in Scotland, a fact unhesitatingly drawn to the attention of advertisers. The appearance of a number of rival local newspapers (particularly the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Herald</span>, 1832, and the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Free Press</span>, 1853) helped consolidate the <span class="italic">Journal</span>'s own political stance. On Chalmers's retirement in 1854 the management passed to his two eldest sons, James [v] (<i>d</i>. 1896) and John Gray (<i>d</i>. 1890).<br>
<br>David Chalmers died on 24 April 1859 at his estate at Westburn, near Aberdeen (purchased in 1823), and was buried at St Nicholas's Church; his wife died, aged seventy-seven, on 20 March 1870. Six years later the family business was sold to form the North of Scotland Newspaper and Printing Co. Ltd, by which date the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal</span> had become a daily with conservative political principles. Late nineteenth-century competition for readers was intense, though the position of the <span class="italic">Journal</span> was made secure by John Gray Chalmers's bequest of &pound;10,000, to be invested for the benefit of the paper. He also left a similar amount to endow the Chalmers chair of English literature at Aberdeen University.<br>
