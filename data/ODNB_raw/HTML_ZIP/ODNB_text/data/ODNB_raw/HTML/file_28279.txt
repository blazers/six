<span class="headword">Viger,  Jacques</span>  (1787&#150;1858), <span class="occ">author and surveyor</span>, only surviving child of Jacques Viger (<i>d</i>. 1798) and Amaranthe Pr&eacute;vost, was born in Montreal, Canada, on 7 May 1787 into an influential family circle. Denis-Benjamin Viger and Louis-Joseph Papineau were among his cousins. He studied at the Coll&egrave;ge St Rapha&euml;l (1799&#150;1808) before leaving to undertake editorial work on <span class="italic">Le Canadien</span> (1808&#150;9). On 17 November 1808 he married Marie-Marguerite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> La Corne, widow of Major John Lennox, and daughter of the Chevalier de St Luc. They had three children, all of whom died in infancy. The marriage brought Viger money from the Lennox estate and stepdaughters from his wife's first marriage. In 1810 he began his scholarly writing with a book on Canadian neologisms which, however, was not published until 1909&#150;10. He served in the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14, as a lieutenant and then captain, and by 1829 was lieutenant-colonel of the Montreal 3rd militia battalion, having kept his interest in military matters.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1813 Viger had become surveyor of roads and bridges in Montreal. This post involved him in some early town planning, and in 1817 and 1837 he had town directories of Montreal compiled to help in his work. In 1825 he became census commissioner and by requiring information over and above that demanded by census legislation he compiled a set of returns which form a valuable historical source and of which he compiled a summary. It has been suggested that he collaborated with Joseph Bouchette in drawing the first map of the city or by contributing to his topographical works, but the evidence seems slight. Although he failed in his attempts to achieve a range of public offices, he was mayor of Montreal from 1833 to 1836, helped by his influential political connections. During his time as mayor he had drained a marshy suburb of the city which had been badly hit by the cholera epidemic of 1832, but his term was marred by controversy; in 1836 he lost his post as mayor and in 1840 that of surveyor of roads.<br>
<br>Viger is best known as a local historian and antiquary, although most of his writing remained unpublished. His chief work is his unpublished 43-volume &#145;Ma saberdache&#146;, begun in 1808, of which the first thirty volumes included material which could be used for the history of the Canadas; the latter volumes were a miscellany of notes and documents relating to events in which he himself had taken part. He was also a keen collector of books and materials related to Canadian history. In 1858 he was a founder and first president of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Historique de Montr&eacute;al. He was well connected in influential Roman Catholic church circles and used with pride his title of commander of the papal order of St Gregory the Great, awarded in 1855. Viger died in Montreal on 12 December 1858. Although he and his notes and compilations were much consulted in his lifetime, he had rather little lasting influence because his works were mainly unpublished and, although now accessible in the archives of the S&eacute;minaire de Qu&eacute;bec, long remained in the private possession of his family. His most important work is now judged to be his 1825 census material.<br>
