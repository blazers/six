<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  Roland</span>  (1928&#150;2003), <span class="occ">marketing scholar and businessman</span>, was born on 1 October 1928 at 226 Palmerston Street, Beswick, Manchester, the son of Joshua Smith, police sergeant, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hamblet. His father, originally from Bolton, had been a miner before joining the police. Smith was educated at Burnage grammar school, Manchester, and the University of Birmingham, where he studied economics. He then went to the University of Manchester, where he took his doctorate with a thesis on the Lancashire cotton industry. For his national service he became a flying officer in the RAF, and it was while serving that on 26 July 1954 he married a fellow Mancunian, Joan Shaw, secretary, and daughter of Allen Shaw, cycle dealer. They had no children, but theirs was a very strong, close, and lasting relationship, which provided him with the support and stability that made possible his many achievements. On numerous occasions he would say that it is only possible to be successful in any walk of life if you have a happy personal life&#151;which he did.<br>
<br>On completing his national service in 1955 Smith joined the Footwear Manufacturers' Federation, ultimately becoming assistant director. But in 1960 he returned to the academic world, becoming a lecturer in economics at the University of Liverpool, and only three years later being made director of Liverpool Business School. He pioneered almost single-handed the academic discipline of marketing in Britain. In 1966 he returned to Manchester as the professor of marketing at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. He remained there (latterly part-time) until 1988, returning in 1996 as chancellor, a position he held until 2002. He taught in a very individualistic way. A former student of his later recalled how he came to a lecture where Smith sat behind a great pile of &#145;do it yourself&#146; textbooks on marketing. He rose to begin, and then deliberately sent the books flying to the floor. &#145;That&#146;, he said, &#145;is how much use these will be in the real world of industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>). There were many students of his, such as Terry Leahy (later chief executive of Tesco), Keith Edelman (later chief executive of the Storehouse Group), and Geoffrey Mulcahy (later chief executive of Kingfisher) who took what wisdom Smith had to offer in place of the textbooks, and made successful careers for themselves.<br>
<br>In parallel with his academic career Smith developed his own business career. He attributed his apprenticeship in large-scale entrepreneurship to his contacts with Val Duncan and Mark Turner, leading lights in the mining conglomerate Rio Tinto Zinc; he later described what he had learned from them as &#145;an almost priceless experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). At first he acted as a consultant, but in the 1970s he began to take on directorships, for example at Barrow Hepburn, Midland Aluminium, and Senior Engineering. By the mid-1980s such was the demand for his expertise that he was a director of no less than sixteen companies, including half a dozen of which he was chairman. One colleague mischievously suggested: &#145;A chairmanship is like a pretty girl to him. He sees it and runs after it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>).<br>
<br>Smith burst into national prominence in the early 1980s as chairman of the House of Fraser (1981&#150;6), during its takeover battle with Roland (Tiny) Rowland. At one point he famously told Rowland (echoing Harold Wilson's advice to Hugh Scanlon) to &#145;Get your tanks off my lawn&#146;. Of Rowland himself, formerly a fellow director, he said: &#145;Whatever I told you, you wouldn't be able to print. If he has a redeeming feature, I never saw one&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). He subsequently recommended to shareholders that they accept the rival bid from the Fayed brothers, and left after the takeover went through. He returned to the limelight as chairman of British Aerospace (1987&#150;91), masterminding the company's diversification into property and construction, and its &pound;150 million takeover of Rover, the cost of which was largely recouped by the sale of Rover's interest in the Leyland&#150;DAF trucks group. In 1991 he was knighted, and in the same year he took on two further high-profile responsibilities, as a director of the Bank of England (1991&#150;6) and chairman of Manchester United plc (1991&#150;2002). The former epitomized how far he had come: indeed, this working-class man from Manchester found the room where the bank's board meets, and where William Pitt and other great names had made national policy, rather daunting, and so big that after his first meeting he claimed that he could not hear what anybody was saying. The governor of the bank, Sir Edward George, later said of him: &#145;his advice was always forthright but perceptive, and he made an enormous input to the Bank, both on management and on policy issues&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Smith's chairmanship of Manchester United was perhaps the role which gave him the most personal satisfaction. A lifelong supporter of the club, he presided over it during one of its most successful periods, both on and off the pitch. He steered the club through its flotation, and contributed significantly to its marketing success, so that by the time of his retirement it was valued at over &pound;1 billion. Martin Edwards, a former chief executive of Manchester United, said of him: &#145;Roland's contribution is not just about enhancing the club's financial position, it is also about his personal involvement and enthusiasm&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Though well rewarded in some posts, Smith took on others for little remuneration, and his primary motivation was always intellectual interest. Garry Weston, chairman of Associated British Foods, described his particular skill as always &#145;asking the right questions&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Another colleague&#151;a director of Hepworth's, of which Smith was chairman from 1986 to 1997&#151;said that &#145;his grasp of financial data and statistics is mind-blowing. He brought a depth of vision to this company which was previously lacking&#146;  (ibid.). His business experience significantly enhanced his teaching, and both combined to take him into more rarefied didactic environments. He was, for instance, only the fourth person and the first Briton to deliver the annual stock exchange lecture (his predecessors being Sheikh Yamani, David Rockefeller, and Harry Oppenheim). He also chaired, for the duke of Edinburgh, the Commonwealth Study Conference in 1992. His numerous teaching and business commitments left little time for other activities, though he enjoyed walking in the Pennines, and was active in support of a number of local charities&#151;such as the Christie Hospital's appeal for state of the art equipment for the treatment of cancer patients. Subsequently he developed cancer himself, and after a short illness he died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on 20 November 2003. He was survived by his wife, Joan.<br>
