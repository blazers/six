<span class="headword">Jones,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Thomas Jones yr Almanaciwr]</span>  (1648&#150;1713), <span class="occ">publisher and almanac maker</span>, was born on 1 May 1648 at Tre'r-dd&ocirc;l, near Corwen, Merioneth. His parents' names are unknown, but his father was a tailor, a trade which his son inherited. At some time in 1666 he joined the stream of masterless men who journeyed to London in search of fame and fortune. Having gained little success as a tailor, he turned to bookselling and began to describe himself as &#145;a lover of Learning, and Student in Astrology, and Autodidactus&#146;  (Jenkins, &#145;Sweating Astrologer&#146;, 163). In January 1679 he was granted sole rights for the compilation, printing, and publishing of an annual Welsh almanac, and from then until his death in 1713 he was known throughout Wales as Thomas Jones yr Almanaciwr (Thomas Jones the Almanac Maker).<br>
<br>Jones lived in Lower Moorfields and sold his wares in a variety of shops in Paul's Alley, Cobbs Court in Blackfriars, and Tower Hill. He rubbed shoulders with celebrities of Grub Street fame, including Tom Brown, Francis Moore (compiler of <span class="italic">Old Moore's Almanack</span>), and Tom D'Urfey, but came to despise the cut-throat world of printers and publishers and the crime and debauchery prevalent in the capital. Although he was a sharp and resourceful businessman, he was seldom able to steal a march over his rivals, and in faraway Wales shameless pedlars and booksellers made off with his profits. He yearned for the opportunity to return to his native land, and when the <span class="roman">Printing Act</span> was allowed to lapse in 1695, thereby enabling printers and publishers to set up presses in the provinces, he and his wife, Mary, packed their bags and established a printing office in the fashionable residential area of Hill's Lane in Shrewsbury, a thriving provincial town which served as the natural capital of mid-Wales. From that time onwards until his death in 1713 Jones established a reputation as the most inventive and successful publisher of Welsh books. Indeed, he was chiefly responsible for Shrewsbury's pre-eminence as the printing capital of Wales in the first half of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Between 1680 and 1713 Jones published an annual Welsh almanac, and became widely known in Shrewsbury as the Stargazer and in his native land as the Sweating Astrologer. An irremediable hypochondriac, he contracted a variety of ailments and maladies, including a bizarre version of the sweating sickness which, he claimed, drew from his body twenty-eight barrels of sweat over a period of six years in the 1690s. His eagerly awaited almanacs sold much better than other ephemera not only because of their intriguing astrological guides (which were invariably couched in obscure and delphic language) but also because they included fascinating details of his medical condition. The Welsh almanac was also sprinkled with passages of wry humour and biting satire. Jones's forthright views about Welsh quislings and popish traitors, together with his running battles with rival almanac makers, kept sales buoyant and enlivened the printing scene in Wales and the borders.<br>
<br>Jones's thriving press, however, was not exclusively concerned with the production of entertaining, hastily prepared, and shoddily bound almanacs and ballads. An ardent patriot and champion of his ailing native tongue, Jones was determined to infuse new life into &#145;the old and most excellent British language&#146;. His most valuable contribution in this direction was the publication of <span class="italic">Y Gymraeg yn ei disgleirdeb / The British Language in its Lustre</span> (1688), a substantial Welsh&#150;English dictionary, and an enlarged version of Foulke Owen's <span class="italic">Cerdd-lyfr</span> (1696), an anthology of Welsh poems. He feared that the Welsh had been &#145;blotted out of the Books of Records&#146; and that they were in serious danger of losing their language, literature, and history. As the patronage of the gentry dwindled alarmingly, he believed that it was necessary for the Welsh press to print the works of leading poets such as Huw Morys, Dafydd Manuel, and Owen Gruffydd, and also to publicize the newly revived eisteddfodau, which were held annually in convivial taverns in Welsh market towns from around 1700 onwards. His prefaces to his books and almanacs invariably extolled the merits of the Welsh language and disparaged the Anglicizing gentry who were swiftly abandoning their native tongue.<br>
<br>A devout churchman and a fierce enemy of Catholicism and dissent, Jones ensured that his publications not only stiffened the cause of Anglicanism but also nourished anti-popish sentiments and Francophobia among readers. He published a Welsh version of the Popish Plot in 1684, a Welsh edition of the book of matins in 1683, a Welsh prayer book in 1687&#150;8, and large numbers of devotional books, the most successful of which was a Welsh translation of Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> in 1699. Even his best-selling ballads, which included tales of monstrous births, grisly murders, and ill-fated courtships, had a moral sting in the tail.<br>
<br>Apart from the pecuniary motive, Jones's principal aim as a publisher was to provide humble readers with cheap, popular, and accessible reading material. With the aid of agents, booksellers, clergymen, and shopkeepers he established a remarkably successful system of book distribution which enabled his publications to reach the growing numbers of farmers, craftsmen, and artisans who were acquiring the reading habit in late Stuart Wales. During the 1680s the only literate parishioner in Llanfihangel Tre'r-beirdd, Anglesey, was a cooper, who taught the father of the celebrated Morris brothers to read by using Thomas Jones's publications. &#145;Who knows&#146;, wrote William Morris, &#145;but that you and I would be illiterate were it not for that old fellow &hellip; who taught our father &hellip; and so started the blessed gift&#146;  (Jenkins, &#145;Sweating Astrologer&#146;, 175). Welsh poets, understandably pleased to see their work in print, sang his praises loudly, though highbrow Welsh scholars were fiercely critical of him. Moses Williams was so infuriated by Jones's plagiarism and arrogance that he annotated his personal copy of <span class="italic">Y Gymraeg yn ei disgleirdeb</span> with the epithets &#145;Tom the Tailor&#146; and &#145;Tom-ass&#146;.<br>
<br>Thomas Jones died in Shrewsbury, aged sixty-five, on 6 August 1713, and was buried two days later in St Mary's parish church, Shrewsbury. A man of considerable, if sometimes misplaced, energy, Jones was rather more than a plausible rogue. His books, almanacs, and ballads reached a wider cross-section of Welsh society than ever before, and his contribution to the cultural and religious life of Wales was not inconsiderable. There is much truth in William Morris's grudging posthumous tribute: &#145;[he was] an old fellow who, in spite of his ignorance, did a lot of good&#146;  (Jenkins, &#145;Sweating astrologer&#146;, 175).<br>
