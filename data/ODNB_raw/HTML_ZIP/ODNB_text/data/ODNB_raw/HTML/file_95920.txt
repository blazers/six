</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Doll, Sir  (William) Richard Shaboe</span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">physician and epidemiologist</span>, was born at 15 Park Road, Hampton Hill, Middlesex, on 28 October 1912, the elder son of Henry William Doll, physician and surgeon, and his wife, Amy Kathleen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shaboe, concert pianist. He was educated at Westminster School, where he showed a flair for mathematics and considered studying it at university. Instead he studied medicine and by chance became an epidemiologist&#151;an ideal vocation for a numerate doctor with a social conscience, since it permitted him to apply his talents to major public health problems around the world.<h2>
<a name="Earlyinfluences"></a>Early influences</h2>Much of Doll's upbringing at home was by his Victorian grandmother. When he left school in 1931 he was turning away from religion and towards pacifism and socialism, influenced by the First World War and by the growing numbers of demoralized unemployed. As a medical student at St Thomas's Hospital, London (1931&#150;7), he delivered babies in the slums of Lambeth and was appalled by the living conditions, malnutrition, and poverty. He became increasingly aware that much disease and premature death could be prevented by social change. He helped organize the St Thomas's Socialist Society, joined the Communist Party, and visited Soviet Russia (and, for different reasons, Nazi Germany). He participated in the Jarrow march in 1936, a mass protest against unemployment, providing first aid to the marchers, and energetically helped raise funds for medical aid to the republicans in the Spanish Civil War.<br>
<br>Soon after Doll qualified, the Second World War began. By then he had already predicted and accepted the necessity of war with Nazi Germany and had volunteered for the Royal Army Medical Corps, with which he served throughout the war. Three days after the outbreak of hostilities he went to France as medical officer to a regular battalion, the First Loyals. He treated and helped evacuate many wounded through the chaotic retreat to Dunkirk, despite sustained shelling and air attack, taking charge when other officers were lost, and leading men to safety. In 1941 he was sent to Egypt, travelling via the Cape (with Archie Cochrane), and served as medical officer in a Cairo infectious disease ward and then on a hospital ship in the Mediterranean that was closely involved with the Salerno landings. He developed renal tuberculosis and was repatriated in 1944; the kidney was removed, and he recovered.<br>
<br>He met his future wife, Joan Mary Faulkner (1913&#150;2001), who was at the time married to Hugh Charles Faulkner, at a meeting of communist doctors. She was the formidably intelligent daughter of Charles Duncan Blatchford (a son in Blatchford and Sons, artificial limb manufacturers) and Susan Margherita, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rota (a forceful Italian who had grown up in the Lambeth area, and eventually lived with Richard and Joan for many years). Like Doll Joan was committed to political change, only partly to improve health, and both campaigned for the establishment of a national health service in Britain, in 1948 jointly writing a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Humanise our Hospitals</span>. They remained communists (although increasingly uneasily so, after the 1948 Lysenko affair) for some twenty years, but a year after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and Khrushchov's secret speech describing the realities of the Stalin era they resigned, and came to accept the impracticality and undesirability of centrally planned command economies.<br>
<br>Doll proposed marriage to Joan on 8 May 1945 (VE-day, when war ended in Europe). She divorced, and they eventually married on 4 October 1949, at Kensington register office, Doll thereby becoming stepfather to her son, Tim. As Joan could not have further children they wanted to adopt, but the Dolls were atheists and at that time adoption agencies required evidence of the Christian commitment of prospective adoptive parents. With advice from the British Humanist Association they set up the Agnostics' Adoption Society. It was initially based in their home, and the Dolls used their own funds to help hire its first social worker. The society grew considerably, changing its name in 1964 to the Independent Adoption Society and expanding its remit. The Dolls themselves adopted two children, Nicholas in 1954 and Catherine in 1956. Initially to help with child and grandmother care, Isabelle (Steve) Sutherland kept house for the Dolls for four decades.<br>
<br>At the suggestion of Joan, by then a rising administrative star at the Medical Research Council (MRC), Doll began his research at the Central Middlesex Hospital with the eminent gastroenterologist Francis Avery Jones, studying peptic ulcer, and conducting perhaps the first factorial randomized clinical trial. Although Doll soon moved elsewhere he was considerably influenced by Avery Jones's scientific temperament, and continued to do some research and clinical work in gastroenterology at the Central Middlesex until moving to Oxford in 1969.<br>
<br>Concurrently Doll (along with several other post-war doctors who wanted to help make a better world) began to study medical statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine under an extraordinarily influential epidemiologist and teacher, Austin (Tony) Bradford Hill, just as Hill was introducing the medical profession to randomization. In 1947 Hill was asked by the MRC to investigate the reasons for the rising mortality from lung cancer in the UK. Hill had observed the quality of Doll's research with Avery Jones and offered him a research post, seeking new causes of lung cancer. Doll and Hill's long collaboration discovered the main hazards of smoking, helped change the ways in which causes of disease would be investigated and understood, and greatly strengthened the discipline of epidemiology.<h2>
<a name="Smokinglungcancerandotherdiseases"></a>Smoking, lung cancer, and other diseases</h2>The mortality attributed to lung cancer in the UK (among people of a given age) had been increasing rapidly for decades. It was known by 1947 that part of this increase was an artefact, caused by the increasing ability of doctors to recognize the disease. Such artefacts should, however, have affected men and women similarly, yet the increase was far steeper in men. These lung cancer trends did not attract much attention until after the Second World War. Many then blamed increasing atmospheric pollution, perhaps from coal smoke, and Doll himself originally thought the increase might well be due chiefly to occupational factors, or to the tarring of roads, as there were known animal carcinogens in tar.<br>
<br>The results of Doll and Hill's first study were, however, clear: the one consistent difference between lung cancer patients (cases) and other patients (controls) was that almost all of the lung cancer patients had smoked. Doll and Hill published their conclusion in 1950 that smoking was &#145;a factor, and an important factor, in the production of carcinoma of the lung&#146;  (R. Doll and A. B. Hill, &#145;Smoking and carcinoma of the lung: preliminary report&#146;, <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 1950, 2.746). Four American studies also published in 1950 (including one of comparable size, by Ernst L. Wynder and Evarts A. Graham) independently found the same association, as had two smaller German studies published in 1939 and 1943 that had been largely or wholly overlooked in England and America. Doll and Hill's second report, published in 1952, cited all these American, German, and British studies as being mutually supportive (and Doll consistently cited all of them in his historical perspectives written in the 1980s and 1990s). Extraordinarily, even with such strong evidence so clearly presented from case-control studies, most of the medical and scientific community in the early 1950s, many of whom themselves smoked, still did not accept that smoking could cause lung cancer, and argued that there must be other explanations for the association.<br>
<br>Although Doll and Hill understood that there was already proof beyond reasonable doubt that smoking was an important cause of lung cancer, they also understood that further research was needed, partly to help convince sceptics and partly to see whether smoking also caused other diseases. In 1951 they enrolled 40,000 British doctors into a new type of study, asking them about their smoking habits and then following them prospectively over many years to see what the doctors died of. On 26 June 1954 the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> published the first prospective results, confirming that lung cancer rates were much higher in smokers, and increased with the amount smoked. In 1956 Doll and Hill reported that smokers also had higher death rates from heart disease, chronic lung disease, and many other conditions. In 1957 the British (because of Doll and Hill) and Dutch were the first governments to accept officially that smoking caused lung cancer; now, all governments do so. Doll succeeded Hill as director of the MRC statistics unit in 1962, and their ten-year findings appeared in 1964. By then competent scientific doubt about smoking as a cause of lung cancer was past, and a consensus was emerging that smoking also killed even more people by other diseases.<br>
<br>Doll continued for fifty years to follow meticulously every British doctor he had originally recruited in 1951 who still lived in Britain. Richard Peto, statistician and (eventually) epidemiologist, joined Doll in 1967 and collaborated closely on the prospective study of doctors, and much else, until Doll's death in 2005. Over these decades the epidemic of smoking-related deaths in Britain (and elsewhere) was evolving in complex ways. On 26 June 2004 the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> published the fifty-year follow-up, showing that persistent cigarette smokers born in the first few decades of the twentieth century died, on average, ten years earlier than otherwise similar non-smokers. Importantly, they also showed that stopping smoking was remarkably effective at reducing the risk of dying prematurely. By then the situation in Britain had been transformed. Doll lived long enough to see widespread cessation of smoking in Britain, and to see the proportion of the male population killed by tobacco before the age of seventy fall from 20 per cent at 1970 death rates (half of all male deaths in middle age) to just 5 per cent at 2005 rates. In 1970 British men had the worst rates in the world of premature death from tobacco, but over the next few decades they had the world's greatest decrease in such deaths.<h2>
<a name="Strengtheningepidemiologyandimprovingpublichealth"></a>Strengthening epidemiology and improving public health</h2>Although best known for his work on smoking, Doll made an extraordinary range of other contributions to epidemiology and public health. Before the 1950s most epidemiological studies had been of infectious diseases, often with a relatively fast-acting organism as a necessary cause. Different concepts were needed to study non-infectious causes of disease, some of which, such as smoking, took decades to have their full effect on risk. Moreover, the fact that many people could smoke yet not develop lung cancer and that a few with lung cancer were non-smokers troubled many with traditional views on how to attribute and understand causation. Hill and Doll helped introduce new guidelines for assessing causality&#151;based, among other things, on the presence of a dose-response relationship and the time sequence of events. By 1950 the leading causes of death in developed countries (heart disease, stroke, and cancer) were no longer the infectious diseases, and subsequent investigations into their causes relied heavily on the criteria clearly articulated by Hill and Doll. Furthermore, much of the proper understanding of the relative merits of different types of epidemiological study design can be traced to Hill and Doll's careful discussion of the implications of their various studies. Doll's influential Rock Carling lecture, published as a monograph in 1967 entitled <span class="italic">Prevention of Cancer: Pointers from Epidemiology</span>, summarized the understanding that had by then developed of the avoidability of each major type of cancer.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s Doll embarked on a series of studies with Michael Court Brown of the long-term effects of medical exposures to moderate doses of X-rays (by following up people who had been treated with X-rays to alleviate spinal disease). Although heavy exposure was known to cause cancer they demonstrated that moderate doses could also cause cancer, particularly leukaemia, establishing for the first time within one study a dose-response relationship between radiation and cancer. For the rest of his life Doll collaborated extensively in several quantitative epidemiological studies of low-dose radiation of various types.<br>
<br>Doll also instigated successful studies of cancer in the coal gasification, nickel refining, and asbestos industries. In 1955 he completed a study (in collaboration with the company) of the mortality of men who had worked at Turner Brothers Asbestos in Yorkshire. The striking results, with a tenfold increase of lung cancer in heavily exposed workers, led the company's lawyers to attempt to suppress the research, claiming the military importance of asbestos, the irrelevance of long-past occupational exposures, and private ownership of the employment records. Despite legal threats Doll and Hill promptly published their findings, after which the company agreed to continue indefinitely to provide Doll with current and past employment records for independent analysis, which were eventually used to demonstrate a significant continuing hazard.<br>
<br>Soon after the contraceptive pill became available in 1960 reports of adverse effects, particularly venous thrombosis, began to appear. Doll immediately realized that systematic epidemiological investigations were needed to obtain reliable evidence about the effects of the pill on health and helped others initiate and interpret them. He continued until 2005 to be closely involved in studies of the effects of the pill on cancer, participating actively in worldwide meta-analyses of all relevant epidemiological studies. These eventually showed that there was only a small and transient increase in the incidence of breast cancer, which was outweighed by a lifelong decrease in that of ovarian cancer.<br>
<br>Doll also showed, more clearly than anyone, that cancer arose, sometimes over a period of many decades, from a combination of nature, nurture, and luck. During the 1960s he was a key figure in bringing together evidence from cancer registries in five continents that showed that each type of cancer that was common in one population was rare in another. He argued that these differences were not chiefly genetic, so wherever one type of cancer was common, it did not have to be. In 1981 Doll and Peto set about quantifying the avoidable causes of cancer in countries such as the UK and USA, presenting their findings in a report to the American Congressional Office of Technology Assessment that was published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the National Cancer Institute</span> (vol. 66, 1981, 1191&#150;308). They found that the hazards of smoking were more than twice the sum of every other reliably known cancer hazard, and that man-made environmental pollutants played a relatively minor role.<br>
<br>Doll made major contributions to epidemiological methodology and disease prevention for more than fifty years, and played a central role in strengthening public health institutions and supporting the careers and inspiring the work of later generations of epidemiologists and medical statisticians. He tried to help whoever sought his advice, and made a point of finding time to provide concise and constructive comments on their research plans and scientific reports.<h2>
<a name="ExpandingmedicaleducationandresearchinOxford"></a>Expanding medical education and research in Oxford</h2>Doll moved to Oxford in 1969 as regius professor of medicine, the most senior medical post in the university. He quickly set about expanding the medical school and enhancing the quality of research. He made a series of new professorial appointments, broadened the scope of the medical curriculum, and helped his successors transform the faculty into one of the top medical institutions in the world.<br>
<br>While regius professor Doll also managed to found Green College (since 2008 Green Templeton College). This was a difficult task, requiring considerable diplomatic skills not only to raise money but also to get Oxford medical students and the university to agree to a new graduate college that would initially specialize in one main subject, medicine. Doll took early retirement to become the first warden of Green College. He and Joan (who had by then retired, but had been the first woman with a senior MRC position) treated the students, staff, and fellows as their extended family, from which they got much interest and pleasure.<br>
<br>The twenty-five years after Doll's retirement in 1979 as regius professor were extraordinarily productive. He wrote, travelled, and lectured, and collaborated with many others in new research on tobacco, alcohol, radiation, breast cancer, and vascular disease. Half a century earlier he had helped Bradford Hill to establish randomized trials, and was delighted to see the clarity with which large-scale randomized evidence could answer important questions.<br>
<br>Until weeks before his death Doll continued working every day in the Cancer Epidemiology Unit (directed since 1989 by Valerie Beral) or the Clinical Trial Service Unit (co-directed since 1985 by Rory Collins and Richard Peto). In June 2005 both units moved into the newly built Richard Doll Building, devoted to large-scale population studies of the causes, prevention, and treatment of cancers, heart attacks, strokes, and other major diseases. Doll worked in the building only briefly before his death, admiring its spaciousness, but still more the large research projects that it was already facilitating.<h2>
<a name="Internationalrecognitionandinfluence"></a>International recognition and influence</h2>The importance of Doll's work was soon recognized throughout the world. He won many awards, including the United Nations award for cancer research in 1962, and was the first recipient of the General Motors cancer research prize in 1979. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1966, was its vice-president in 1970, and received the society's royal medal in 1986. He was knighted in 1971 and made a Companion of Honour in 1996. He received numerous honorary doctorates and fellowships, both in the UK and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Doll's integrity, courtesy, sharp mind, and precise use of language made him an effective chairman of many committees and an impartial adviser to various government departments and industries. His strategic aims in such work were to ensure that the epidemiological evidence would be described accurately, distinguishing between established and unproven claims, and to ensure that employment records would be kept and analysed in ways that would ensure that any real hazards were discovered sooner rather than later, and that mistaken claims of hazard or safety would be minimized. He was open about his dealings with industry, received no retainers, and always gave away whatever consultancy fees or honoraria he received, usually to Green College. He also gave away some of the prizes he was awarded. He was regularly invited to deliver major lectures, and in the last year of his life he lectured in seven different countries on five different continents.<h2>
<a name="Personalqualities"></a>Personal qualities</h2>Elegant and well-mannered, Doll thought, wrote, and spoke clearly, choosing his words carefully; his publications, although concerned with factual matters, were often a pleasure to read. Having lived through the 1930s he understood how greatly medical science in general, and epidemiology in particular, could improve people's lives. Thus motivated, he worked efficiently, and for long hours. He found good epidemiology beautiful and intellectually satisfying, considering himself to have been extraordinarily lucky professionally.<br>
<br>Many found Doll's apparent severity daunting, but behind the sometimes austere exterior was a mischievous interior that enjoyed nonconformity, and his wit was delightful. He dressed immaculately, and wore vivid ties in later life that he enjoyed people noticing. He and Joan loved and depended on each other, and had similar professional values. For two years after she died in 2001 grief predominated in private, but in his last two years he had more internal peace, and retained his intellect and humour. He liked to say that old people should take risks, and in his ninety-third year he rode on a camel in the Arabian desert, flew in a glider, and climbed a jungle tree in Australia.<br>
<br>Doll had a remarkable ability to interpret, assimilate, and remember population-based evidence and to put into perspective the major and minor avoidable causes of disease. This was not a theoretical exercise; he was conscious that his conclusions must not be wrong, as people's lives and livelihoods were at stake. The more closely people worked with Doll, the more they respected him. His wide experience, careful judgement, integrity, and rigour&#151;all obvious to those who worked with him&#151;meant that he was rarely wrong, and never stubbornly wrong. He was one of the most important medical scientists of the twentieth century. He died with dignity at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 24 July 2005, of heart failure, and was survived by his adopted children.<br>
<br>As a result of the twentieth-century epidemiological studies of smoking, of which Doll's were among the most influential, many millions of premature deaths had already been prevented by the time he died; according to the World Health Organization, hundreds of millions of deaths from tobacco would be prevented during the twenty-first century. Doll's own words (of 1994) are engraved on his memorial stone in the Richard Doll Building:<blockquote>Death in old age is inevitable but death before old age is not. In previous centuries 70 years used to be regarded as humanity's allotted span of life and only about one in five lived to such an age. Nowadays, however, for non-smokers in Western countries, the situation is reversed; only about one in five will die before 70 and the non-smoker death rates are still decreasing, offering the promise, at least in developed countries, of a world where death before 70 is uncommon. But, for this promise to be properly realised, ways must be found to limit the vast damage now being done by tobacco and to bring home, to not only the many millions of people in developed countries but also the far larger populations elsewhere, the extent to which those who continue to smoke are shortening their expectation of life by so doing.</blockquote>
