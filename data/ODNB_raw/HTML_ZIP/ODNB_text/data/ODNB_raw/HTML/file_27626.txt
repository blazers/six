<span class="headword">Townshend,  George Ferrars</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>George Compton]</span>, third Marquess Townshend  (1778&#150;1855), <span class="occ">disinherited aristocrat</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27625/', "George Townshend, second Marquess Townshend (1753&#150;1811)")</script>, and his wife, Charlotte Ellerker (<i>d</i>. 1802), of Risby Park, Yorkshire. He was born on 13 December 1778 in Wimpole Street, London, and was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1798. He was known as Lord Chartley and Lord Leicester before succeeding as marquess in 1811. He had a serious dispute with his father over the use of the title of earl of Leicester, and was subsequently disinherited by him in favour of his younger brother, Charles. Reasons for the rupture are not made explicit. Farington described him as &#145;a very effeminate young man&#151;sometimes he wore pink ribbons on his shoes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Farington Diary</span>, ed. Greig, 4.223), and his marriage, to Sarah (<i>c</i>.1786&#150;1858), daughter of John Dunn-Gardner of Chatteris, was an unmitigated disaster. They married on 12 May 1807, and by November of the same year were reported to be on the point of separation. They separated in the following year, Lady Chartley accusing him of impotence and &#145;not being formed as a man should be&#146;  (<span class="italic">Farington Diary</span>, ed. Greig, 5.75). Townshend lived chiefly at Genoa, where he was known as Mr Compton. He died under that name on 31 December 1855 at his home, the Villa Rostan, Pegli, near Genoa, and was buried in the protestant cemetery of San Benigno. His wife went through a ceremony of marriage at Gretna Green on 24 October 1809 with John Margetts (<i>d</i>. 1842) and was known as Mrs Margetts until 1823; they had at least three sons and two daughters. From 1823 she styled herself Marchioness Townshend, a form of address to which she was perfectly entitled, no divorce having taken place. It was under that name that she died, on 11 September 1858, at Brighton, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. She had married, on 10 January 1856, James Laidler of Fenton, Northumberland. Her eldest surviving son from her liaison with Margetts, John, called himself Lord John Townshend from 1823 until 1828, when he adopted the title of earl of Leicester. An act of parliament of 1842&#150;3 ruled that these were not legitimate children of the Townshend marriage, overturning the legal doctrine that where a marriage existed, the husband was presumed to be the father of all the children. Thereafter, the son, who was Conservative MP for Bodmin in 1841&#150;6, took his grandmother's name, Dunn-Gardner, by royal licence.<br>
