<span class="headword">Sedgwick,  Obadiah</span>  (1599/1600&#150;1658), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of St Peter, Marlborough, Wiltshire, son of Joseph Sedgwick, the vicar there. With two younger brothers, <a href="#cosubject_25015">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Joseph, he was said to share the characteristic of only &#145;four fingers on a hand&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.66). He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 18 June 1619, aged nineteen, but migrated to Magdalen Hall and graduated BA on 5 May 1620, proceeding MA on 23 January 1623. In 1626 he was tutor to Matthew Hale. After ordination he served as chaplain to Horace, Lord Vere of Tilbury, in the Low Countries, in 1628&#150;9. While there he corresponded with John Davenport and was part of a network of reform-minded clergy. He proceeded BD at Oxford on 16 January 1630, and in the same year became curate and lecturer at St Mildred, Bread Street, London, where he attracted a large following. Censured and suspended by Bishop Juxon in 1637, Sedgwick took refuge at Leez, the earl of Warwick's house in Essex. In 1638 he preached a sermon subsequently published as <span class="italic">Military Discipline for the Christian Souldier</span> (1639) to the London artillery company. In 1639 Warwick presented him to the vicarage of Coggeshall, Essex, worth &pound;110 per annum; Sedgwick was to remain Warwick's friend and an habitu&eacute; of Leez.<br>
<br>After the opening of the Long Parliament, Sedgwick returned to St Mildred's where, in royalist eyes, he confirmed his reputation as a &#145;scandalous and seditious minister&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.441). In 1642 he was one of the six &#145;loving friends&#146; to whom Warwick transferred control of his many Essex advowsons; his fellow trustees included John Pym, Edmund Calamy, and Stephen Marshall. Sedgwick's place in opposition councils was already established. On 25 May 1642 he preached his first fast sermon before the House of Commons, and later that year he was briefly chaplain to the regiment of Colonel Denzil Holles and was present at Edgehill. Nehemiah Wharton approved his &#145;heavenly sermons&#146; to the army  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1641&#150;2</i>, 391).<br>
<br>In 1643 Sedgwick was appointed one of the licensers of divinity books, and he was an original and assiduous member of the Westminster assembly. His sympathies lay with the presbyterians but his views were not rigid. He favoured a Scottish alliance, belonged to a London classis, urged ministerial authority in an orderly church, and deplored the rise of sects: &#145;every Sectary&#146;, he said in 1644, &#145;makes an Arke of his owne fancie&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Arke Against a Deluge</span>, 1644, 19). In 1645 he resigned Coggeshall to become rector of St Andrew's, Holborn, London, and in 1646 he moved to St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Between 1642 and 1648 Sedgwick preached some fourteen or fifteen sermons to one or other of the houses of parliament. From 1642 to 1644 these sermons served the interests of his old political and religious allies, for example, <span class="italic">Haman's Vanity</span> (1643) on the discovery of Waller's plot, <span class="italic">An Arke Against a Deluge</span> (1644) making the best of defeat at Lostwithiel, and an unpublished sermon of 18 December 1644 supporting the self-denying ordinance. Thereafter new preachers and new issues took centre stage, and only one of his later parliamentary sermons was published (<span class="italic">The Nature and Danger of Heresies</span>, 1647). In the same year his <span class="italic">A Short Catechisme</span> appeared.<br>
<br>Sedgwick was a successful preacher who reputedly in hot weather &#145;unbutton[ed] his doublet in the pulpit, that his breath might be longer, and his voice more audible to rail against the king's party&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.442). The style of his printed sermons is clear and easy, less bloodthirsty than that of many of his contemporaries, but marked by vivid images: God's special providence, he said, &#145;clasps the Church, as the fethers of the hen doth the chicken&#146;  (<span class="italic">Haman's Vanity</span>, 1643, 15&#150;16). In person he appears to have possessed the sociability that Warwick valued in his clerical friends. He was uxorious&#151;though very little is known of his wife, Priscilla&#151;and, in the judgement of his enemies, &#145;a sensuall and voluptuous man&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 6.561&#150;2). He opposed episcopacy and believed that the causes of the church and of parliament were interdependent. Despite later disappointment at &#145;the Crossenesse of events&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Shepherd of Israel</span>, 1658, 377), Sedgwick's commitment to the cause he espoused in the early 1640s seems never to have wavered.<br>
<br>In 1651 Sedgwick urged leniency for Christopher Love, in 1653 he was appointed a trier, and in 1654 an assistant to the ejectors of unsatisfactory ministers, but the sermons published posthumously by literary executors who included his old allies Stephen Marshall and Edmund Calamy suggest that in these years he turned increasingly to the pastoral care of his flock. In 1656, as his health failed, he retired to Marlborough, where &#145;he died very wealthy&#146; in January 1658  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.444). He was buried at Ogbourne St Andrew, Wiltshire, beside his father. By his will, dated 17 March 1654, his eldest son inherited land, money, books and plate &#145;which the King and Queene of Bohemia gave unto mee&#146;. His younger children, Frances, Joseph, Susan, and Priscilla, received a total of &pound;2800, and the &#145;godly poor&#146; of Covent Garden &pound;20.<br>

<a name="cosubject_25015"></a><span class="headword">John Sedgwick</span>  (1600/01&#150;1643)<span class="occ"></span> matriculated (aged eighteen) at Queen's College, Oxford, on the same day as his elder brother, Obadiah, and graduated BA from Magdalen Hall on 6 December 1622, proceeding MA on 7 July 1625 and BD on 9 November 1633. He was vicar of Bisley, Gloucestershire, between 1625 and 1638 but was deprived after accusations of simony. He married Anne Buttery, his second wife (nothing is known of the first), in 1632. He became vicar of Clavering, Essex, and in 1641 rector of St Alfege, London Wall. His earlier success as lecturer at St Giles Cripplegate had angered the incumbent, William Fuller, and divided the parish.<br>
<br>Between 1624 and 1643 John Sedgwick published four sermons and <span class="italic">Antinomianisme Anatomized, or, A Glasse for the Lawlesse</span> (1643), a work criticizing those who denied Christians were under &#145;morall law&#146;. As chaplain in Essex's army his &#145;famous sermons&#146; impressed soldiers and civilians alike  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1641&#150;2</i>, 388, 400). In 1643, turning combatant, he lead a regimental assault on Launceston. He died in October 1643 and was buried at St Alfege on 15 October.<br>
