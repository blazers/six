<span class="headword">Martin,  John</span>  (1741&#150;1820), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister</span>, was born at Spalding, Lincolnshire, on 15 March 1741, the son of John Martin (<i>d</i>. 1767), publican and grazier, and Mary King (<i>d</i>. 1756). Partly self-taught, he was also educated at school in Gosberton, and afterwards at Stamford, under Dr Newark. Soon after his mother's death in 1756 he went as office boy to an attorney at Holbeach, but developed religious melancholy, and in 1760 moved to London to attend Dr John Gill's meeting-house. On 11 July 1761 he married Elizabeth Jessup (<i>d</i>. 1765), daughter of a farmer near Sleaford.<br>
<br>In 1763 Martin became convinced of &#145;the duty of believers' baptism&#146; and published a pamphlet, suggested partly by his work in London as a watch-finisher, entitled <span class="italic">Mechanicus and Flavens, or, The Watch Spiritualised</span>. Soon afterwards he was baptized by the Revd Mr Clark in a garden at Blunham, afterwards joining the church at Gamlingay, Bedfordshire. His first charge as a minister was with the Independent congregation in Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire (1764&#150;5), but in 1766 he was ordained to the pastorate of the Particular Baptist congregation in Shepshed, Leicestershire. Within the forward-looking Northamptonshire Association, to which Shepshed was affiliated, Martin promoted itinerancy and village preaching.<br>
<br>In 1773 Martin surprisingly was called to the pastorate of the deeply split church in Grafton Street, Piccadilly, London; three years earlier he had refused to preach to them because of what he took to be their shameful treatment of their ageing minister, William Anderson. He was ordained to the pastorate in March 1774 with Benjamin Wallin, Abraham Booth, and John Macgowan all sharing in the service. One of the occasional hearers during this Grafton Street pastorate was Lord George Gordon of riot fame, who failed to persuade Martin to take office in the Protestant Association. Notwithstanding a serious secession in 1776, Martin built up the remaining congregation, for whom a new chapel in Keppel Street, Bloomsbury, was built in 1795, mainly at the expense of William Ashlin, one of Martin's wealthy deacons, who had earlier seceded from the Eagle Street congregation because of dissatisfaction with the ministry of Thomas Hopkins.<br>
<br>Martin's approach to predestination and the freedom of the human will changed over time. In the 1770s, during his Shepshed pastorate, Andrew Fuller found him commending Jonathan Edwards and castigating the likes of John Gill and John Brine, notwithstanding the fact that he had worshipped with Gill's congregation in London in 1760. Indeed, Martin's Association letter of 1770 has been noted as a key document in concluding the period of the dominance of hyper-Calvinism, with its encouragement of all to approach Christ, among English Baptists. This evangelical stance Martin confirmed in his 1775 sermon on <span class="roman">Romans</span> 10: 3, published under the title <span class="italic">The Rock of Offence</span>, which argued that human failure to submit to the righteousness of God was occasioned by &#145;want of will and want of love&#146;  (Fuller, title-page). His arguments in this sermon were an influence prompting Andrew Fuller to move beyond traditional Calvinist categories in his thinking, while Martin appears to have moved in the opposite direction. This was especially seen in his London years, when Martin showed himself very much more conservative, in theology as in politics, and became a foremost opponent of &#145;Fullerism&#146;, that system of evangelical Calvinism that Fuller developed in the light of what Jonathan Edwards had achieved in the USA and which lay behind the launching of the modern missionary movement. This Martin did in a printed debate with Fuller in the years 1789&#150;91: his <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Duty of Man Relative to Faith in Jesus Christ</span> provoked Fuller to reply in <span class="italic">Remarks on Mr Martin's Publication</span>, which took the form of five letters to a friend.<br>
<br>Apart from theological issues Martin easily became isolated because of his conservative political positions. First, at a meeting of the General Body of Dissenting Ministers in December 1789 he both spoke in favour of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> and insulted a young Presbyterian minister who adopted the opposite stance. Samuel Stennett, from the chair, called upon Martin to apologize, but he refused and left the meeting. Although Martin's action caused him to lose support among his fellow dissenters, he found favour with the government. After Stennett's death in 1795, Martin in 1797 received a warrant from the government to succeed him in distributing the <i>regium donum</i>, though it was not long before he was in conflict with his fellow trustees about both process and product, a dispute that rumbled on from 1798 until 1806, when Martin's warrant was finally withdrawn. The third area of dispute was Martin's sermon, preached on a Sunday evening of January 1798 in Broad Street Chapel. There he alleged, with little sensitivity, that were the French to land in Britain many dissenters would &#145;unite to encourage the French and distress this country&#146;  (Ivimey, 4.77). Writing on behalf of the Baptist Board, Abraham Booth and other Baptist ministers begged Martin in vain not to publish the address, which ran to several editions. Martin not only confirmed his allegation but sought to justify his view, arguing &#145;That Dissenters are not less contaminated with French principles than other people appeared to be incontrovertible &hellip; can you doubt whether some of them &hellip; have wished to plant what they call the Tree of Liberty in Great Britain?&#146;  (ibid., 4.79). The managers of the evening sermon had little option but to exclude him as unfit to give further instruction under their patronage. The Baptist Board also judged Martin's castigation of his fellow dissenters untrue and &#145;highly calumnious&#146;  (ibid., 4.81), and expelled him from their counsels. Martin's &#145;exaggerated and unjust representation&#146;  (ibid., 4.81) was deemed not only unwise but unkind, and against the studied determination of the leaders of the Three Denominations to demonstrate dissenting loyalty by suggesting that many of their number were &#145;desirous of assisting the French Revolutionists to overthrow the monarchy and constitution of their country&#146;  (ibid., 4.81). The Baptist historian Joseph Ivimey seems to suggest that Martin's lack of judgement in part lay in failing to distinguish between dissenters' welcome to the outbreak of the revolution and what was appropriate once the revolution had developed its particular characteristics, especially when the revolutionary regime moved into conflict with neighbouring countries.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1798 Martin was expelled from the London Baptist Board; attempts to effect a reconciliation between Martin and his brethren as late as 1805 proved ineffectual. His sermon of 1798 led to a large secession from his chapel, but he continued to preach with unabated vigour to those remaining until April 1814, when &#145;a stroke of palsy&#146; destroyed his intelligence, causing his withdrawal from the ministry. He survived a further six years until his death in London on 23 April 1820; he was buried in Bunhill Fields.<br>
