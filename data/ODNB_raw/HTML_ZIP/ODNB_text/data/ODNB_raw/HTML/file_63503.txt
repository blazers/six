<span class="headword">Cowan, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1737), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was the son of Alderman John Cowan (<i>d</i>. 1733) of Londonderry and his first wife, Elizabeth. John Cowan's family originated in Stirling, settling in Northern Ireland in the early seventeenth century. Robert Cowan's early activities are little known, but it is clear that he was involved in matters commercial. Some time around 1707 he set up as a merchant in Lisbon, becoming a partner in the firm Cowan and Lort, which went bankrupt because, according to Cowan, Lort made some poor decisions at a time when Cowan was visiting England. For the rest of his life Cowan tried to find a reasonable composition whereby he could repay at least some of his portion of the firm's debts. He left &pound;10,000 in his will to be divided equally among the &#145;lawful creditors&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1719 Cowan secured the East India Company's permission to go to Bombay as a freemerchant. The ship, <i>Cassandra</i>, carrying him to India was taken by George Taylor's pirates off Madagascar (7 August 1720). Cowan assisted Captain James Macrae to negotiate the freedom of the survivors and to get them to Bombay in the ex-pirate vessel <i>Fancy</i>. Macrae used his influence to gain Cowan the patronage of Charles Boone, the governor of Bombay, which saw Cowan immediately established in the Bombay community in a far more advantageous condition than he would have enjoyed as a freemerchant.<br>
<br>Cowan's knowledge of the Portuguese language and culture were of immediate value to the Bombay establishment, which sent him to Goa (25 December 1720). He was charged with negotiating a new and more co-operative relationship between the Portuguese and the British settlements along the west coast of India, both in matters of trade and communications, and in combined operations against the pirate Khanoji Angria. In August 1721 Cowan and the Portuguese viceroy reached agreement on the various points at issue. As a result, Cowan was appointed to the Bombay council.<br>
<br>In 1722 Cowan was sent to Surat to investigate affairs at the British factory. His role in sorting out a number of problems was commended by the company's management. However, it also laid the basis for the dislike of Cowan by the personnel who were disciplined, an antagonism which continued throughout his stay in Bombay.<br>
<br>Between 7 January 1724 and 16 August 1726 Cowan was the chief of the British settlement at Mocha, on the Red Sea, where he tried to reorganize the company's coffee trade. At the same time he managed a significant expansion of trade between Mocha and the west coast of India. His efforts resulted in his promotion to second in council at Bombay (January 1726). On 14 January 1728 he was nominated as president and governor of Bombay, a position he assumed when William Phipps departed (10 January 1729).<br>
<br>Cowan's government was characterized by a significant expansion and maintenance of British political influence and trade in western India and the Red Sea&#150;Persian Gulf area. He concentrated much effort on improving the security of British activities, removing the threat of European and Indian piracy, and he consolidated the British position against other Europeans.<br>
<br>In September 1734 Cowan's term as president and governor ended, and although he was willing to stay on, at least until he could realize all his current investments in the country trade, the company appointed John Horne to take over immediately. Along with the usual envy of Cowan's evident success as a merchant, and the customary factional conflicts between resident Britons and between their patrons in London, Cowan's situation was exacerbated by clear evidence that he had, on occasion, gone beyond what was acceptable practice in the distinction between employees acting on the company's behalf and trading privately. These occasions, while defensible in terms of special circumstances in any given year throughout the trading networks, gave his detractors enough substance to be credible, and he was recalled.<br>
<br>In 1735 Cowan returned to England with hopes of enjoying a &#145;competency&#146; thought to have been around &pound;100,000. On 31 January 1736 he was created a knight bachelor and received his accolade at Whitehall. The following year he was elected to parliament, as a whig, for Tregony borough (9 February 1737). His success was short-lived; he died, unmarried, a few days later (21 February 1737), in London, of complications caused by quinsy.<br>
<br>Robert Cowan's will, probated in Bombay (7 December 1737), left most of his estate to his younger brother William (who died in India around the end of 1736), and after him to his younger half-sister Mary (1713&#150;1788), who also inherited her father's and her brother William's small estates. Mary Cowan married (Dublin, 30 June 1737) her cousin Alexander Stewart (1700&#150;1781). Their son Robert Stewart (1739&#150;1821) became the first marquess of Londonderry.<br>
