<span class="headword">Webster <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Davies]</span>,  (Julia) Augusta</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Cecil Home]</span>  (1837&#150;1894), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 30 January 1837 at Poole, Dorset, one of the six children of Vice-Admiral George Davies RN (1800&#150;1876) and his wife, Julia Hume (1803&#150;1897), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14147/', "Joseph Hume (1767&#150;1844)")</script>, clerk at Somerset House, London, who was of mixed English, Scottish, and French extraction and claimed descent from the Humes of Polwarth, Berwickshire. Augusta's literary interests may well have stemmed from her mother's family; Lamb, Hazlitt, and Godwin were intimate friends of her grandfather Joseph and regular guests at his London home in Bayswater. He was the author of two publications, one a blank-verse translation (1812) of Dante's <span class="italic">Inferno</span> and the other <span class="italic">A Search into the Old Testament</span> (1841).<br>
<br>Augusta's father was born in the parish of Cuthbert, Wells, Somerset, and joined the Royal Navy at the age of thirteen. He was distinguished for his bravery at sea, having performed many dramatic rescues involving feats such as jumping overboard to save drowning comrades. Described as &#145;a perfect and noble specimen of the British sailor&#146; and &#145;in his unpretending way, a hero&#146;  (Watts-Dunton, 355), his honest and generous character may have shaped the strong humanitarian side in Augusta's work. From her father she also inherited a passionate love of the sea, apparent in her poetry, having spent her childhood years living by the water.<br>
<br>Until 1851 the family moved up and down the coast of England, for some time living on the brigantine HMS <i>Griper</i> in Chichester harbour, Sussex. They resided from 1844 to 1848 in Banff Castle in Scotland, Augusta attending school in the town, and then moved to Penzance on the Cornish coast. In 1851 they finally moved inland to Cambridge when George Davies accepted the post of chief constable for Cambridgeshire, to which Huntingdonshire was added in 1857.<br>
<br>In Cambridge, Augusta became known as &#145;one of the brilliant daughters of Admiral Davies&#146;  (Watts-Dunton, 355). She read widely, learned Italian and Spanish, and travelled to Paris and Geneva where she became proficient in French. She liked painting and was a pupil at the new Cambridge School of Art, which opened its doors in 1858 to an inaugural speech given by Ruskin. She enrolled at the South Kensington Art School in London, but here ran into terrible trouble for a spirited attempt at whistling. This resulted in her being expelled from the school, which &#145;almost dashed the prospects of women art students for ever&#146;  (Strachey, 96), so controversial was institutionalized education for women at the time.<br>
<br>Augusta learned Latin and Greek, apparently to help a younger brother with his schoolwork. She later published two skilled literal translations from the Greek, Aeschylus' <span class="italic">Prometheus Bound</span> (1866) and Euripides' <span class="italic">Medea</span> (1868), which achieved critical recognition when women were still largely excluded from the classics. At least two of her siblings shared her academic disposition. In 1864 her elder sister Louisa married the Cambridge mathematician Isaac Todhunter. Her younger brother Gerald Stanley Davies (1845&#150;1927), was for many years a master at Charterhouse School, his own school since the age of ten. He later became master of the Charterhouse in London, of which he produced a learned and authoritative history (1921). He also wrote and published widely on art and sports.<br>
<br>Augusta's early publications, which include two volumes of verse (<span class="italic">Blanche Lisle</span>, 1860; <span class="italic">Lilian Gray</span>, 1864), the novel <span class="italic">Lesley's Guardians</span> (1864), and the prose article &#145;The Brissons&#146; (<span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, 1860), were published under the male pseudonym Cecil Home. It was only after her marriage to Thomas Webster (1832&#150;1913), fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, on 10 December 1863 that she gained the confidence to use her own name. During the next seven years she enjoyed the greatest popularity she would ever achieve as a poet with <span class="italic">Dramatic Studies</span> (1866), <span class="italic">A Woman Sold</span> (1867), and <span class="italic">Portraits</span> (1870), of which the last volume ran into three editions that same year. These works contain a series of dramatic monologues, in part inspired by Robert Browning. Several of the characters who speak out are women, and their concerns reflect the feminist interests which Augusta was developing by now.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1864 Augusta gave birth to her only child, Margaret (1864&#150;1936). She lived in Cambridge with her husband and daughter until 1870, when she persuaded her husband to give up his law practice and move to London. Here she was introduced to literary circles by the critic Theodore Watts-Dunton, who constantly supported and reviewed her work. She worked as reviewer for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and during the 1870s wrote articles on a wide variety of subjects for <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, later collected in the self-deprecatingly entitled <span class="italic">A Housewife's Opinions</span> (1878). Her poetry at this period includes a Chinese tale in verse, <span class="italic">Yu-Pe-Ya's Lute</span> (1872), and <span class="italic">A Book of Rhyme</span> (1884), which contains an innovative attempt to adapt Italian <i>rispetti</i> to English verse. She began a sonnet sequence, <span class="italic">Mother and Daughter</span> (1895), left uncompleted, and wrote a novel for children, <span class="italic">Daffodil and the Croaxaxicans</span> (1884). She also wrote four plays, notably <span class="italic">In a Day</span> (1882) and <span class="italic">The Sentence</span> (1887). The former was performed as a matinee at Terry's Theatre in London in May 1890, with her daughter&#151;as &#145;Davies&#146; Webster &#151;playing the female lead.<br>
<br>During the 1870s and 1880s Augusta participated in a number of conferences on feminist causes and proved herself a talented public speaker. She was twice elected head of the Chelsea division of the London school board and worked hard for the improvement of women's education. She suffered from ill health for most of her adult life, struck by frequent attacks of pleurisy and on occasion obliged to winter in Italy. She died on 5 September 1894 at her home, Springfield, Kew Gardens Road, Kew, London, and was buried on 8 September in the west cemetery of Highgate cemetery, Middlesex. She was survived by her husband.<br>
<br>Webster's poetry, with its strong social concerns, was largely put aside by the aesthetes of the <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> and entirely forgotten by the modernists. Late twentieth-century criticism led to a revival of interest in her verse, and her place in the history of poetry now seems secured. She deserves recognition as one of the foremost Victorian women poets.<br>
