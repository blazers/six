<span class="headword">Harkness,  Margaret Elise</span>  (1854&#150;1923), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, was born on 28 February 1854 at Great Malvern, Worcestershire, the second of five children of Robert Harkness (1826&#150;1886), a Church of England clergyman, and Elizabeth Bolton Toswill (1821&#150;1916). At the time of her marriage to Robert Harkness, Elizabeth, whose maiden name was Seddon, was a widow with a daughter. Margaret's mother was related to the family of Beatrice Potter, later Webb; Margaret and Beatrice were second cousins. Her father's family was related through marriage to George Henry Law, bishop of Bath and Wells, and this connection may be in part responsible for Margaret Harkness's decision to adopt the pen name of John Law for most of her published work.<br>
<br>Harkness was educated at home, although at the age of twenty-one she was sent to Stirling House, a finishing school in Bournemouth. From there she went to London in 1877 to be trained as a nurse at Westminster Hospital. On completion of her training she took up a post at Guy's Hospital, although letters of the time suggest she had little aptitude for the nursing profession. Some time early in the 1880s, therefore, she decided to try to earn her living by her pen, perhaps prompted by Beatrice Potter, who, with her sister Kate, helped Harkness financially and introduced her to a circle of intellectuals whose chief meeting-place was the reading-room of the British Museum.<br>
<br>Harkness now began to take an increased interest in radical politics, and her direct experience of poverty in London's East End, together with her friendship with such women as Eleanor Marx and Annie Besant, helped shape her growing conviction that socialism offered a solution to the problems of social inequality, poverty, and hardship which she saw about her. She was for a short time a member of the Social Democratic Federation, and through her membership met Henry Champion (1859&#150;1928), John Burns, and Tom Mann, with all of whom she would work during the London dock strike of 1889. Her major contribution to the strike was her visit to Cardinal Manning on 5 September 1889, which may have been instrumental in persuading him to intervene. When she came to write of her experiences of working in the labour movement, in <span class="italic">George Eastmont: Wanderer</span> (1905), she dedicated the book to &#145;the memory of His Eminence Cardinal Manning with whom the author was associated during the Great Dock Strike of 1889&#146;.<br>
<br>By the time of the strike Harkness was the author of two novels. The first, <span class="italic">A City Girl</span> (1887), had drawn favourable comments from Engels, to whom she had sent a copy. Her second and finest novel, <span class="italic">Out of Work</span> (1888), is concerned with key events in London during jubilee year, especially the famous occasion of &#145;bloody Sunday&#146;, the march of the unemployed on 13 November 1887 which ended with police charging the crowd that had assembled in Trafalgar Square. One man was killed, many injured, and Burns was arrested and then sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment. Harkness puts the occasion to good use in her novel.<br>
<br>In 1888 Harkness also published in book form a series of articles she had edited for the <span class="italic">British Weekly: a Journal of Social and Christian Progress</span> on the temptations awaiting young men and women in London. From this came her best-known work, originally called <span class="italic">Captain Lobe: a Story of the Salvation Army</span> and republished two years later under the title by which it is still known, <span class="italic">In Darkest London</span>. In 1890 she published <span class="italic">A Manchester Shirtmaker</span>, based on a short stay in that city. She also worked in Scotland in 1887 and 1888 as a contact for Champion with the Scottish miners' leader Keir Hardie. Other trips took her out of England, to Germany, and then in 1891 to New Zealand and Australia, where, after a brief return, she seems to have stayed for some years.<br>
<br>After that Harkness's movements become increasingly difficult to trace. From 1906 until the outbreak of the First World War she appears to have spent most of her time in the Indian subcontinent. Annie Besant seems to have introduced her to Theosophy, which led her to attend the annual convention in Madras in 1907. However, she soon became more interested in Indian nationalism and set out to explore Indian life: <span class="italic">Glimpses of Hidden India</span> (1909), revised and reissued under a new title, <span class="italic">Indian Snapshots</span> (1912), tells something of her wanderings. By now she had abandoned socialism&#151;conjecturally as a result of the failure of her relationship with Henry Champion&#151;in favour of the ideals of the Salvation Army. Her last known work, <span class="italic">A Curate's Promise: a Story of Three Weeks, September 14&#150;October 5 1917</span> (1921), recounts a curate's decision to join the Salvation Army rather than become an army chaplain. During her last years she lived in France and then Italy. She died at the Pensione Castagnoli in Florence on 10 December 1923.<br>
