<span class="headword">Pettitt,  Henry Alfred</span>  (1848&#150;1893), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 7 April 1848 at Cape Hill, Smethwick, near Birmingham, the son of Edwin Pettitt, a civil engineer, and his wife, Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hart. Pettitt was educated at a school kept by the Revd William Smerdon, but was thrown on his own resources at the age of thirteen, as a result of the failure of his father's investment in cotton patent machinery, which forced him to leave England and live abroad. Henry Pettitt tried various professions, including an attempt on the stage at Sadler's Wells, and he was for two years clerk in the head offices in London of Messrs Pickford &amp; Co., the carriers. He wrote without remuneration for various periodicals, and tried his hand at writing novels, producing <span class="italic">The Cotton Lord</span> (1862) and <span class="italic">Uncle Crotty's Relations</span> (1864) under the pseudonym Herbert Glyn. About 1869 he obtained a post as junior English master in the North London Collegiate School, High Street, Camden Town.<br>
<br>Still writing for periodicals and for the stage, Pettitt reached a turning point when he was paid &pound;5 for <span class="italic">Golden Fruit</span>, a drama produced at the East London Theatre (14 July 1873). Before this time he had written, in collaboration with Paul Merritt, <span class="italic">British Born</span>, in a prologue and three acts, produced on 17 October 1872 at the Grecian Theatre, of which Merritt had been a principal support. Between 1875 and 1893 Pettitt went on to produce (singly and with collaborators) an extraordinary number of plays for the London stage and touring companies. At one time, twenty-two companies were on tour in England and six in America, performing his pieces. According to one authority, &#145;Six dramas in which he had collaborated were on in London the same evening&#146;, although no specifics are given as to the date involved  (Boase, <span class="italic">Mod. Eng. biog.</span>, 2.1486).<br>
<br>Pettit was to collaborate with writers such as Merritt, George Conquest, Augustus Harris, Charles Reade, George R. Sims, and Sydney Grundy. His partnership with Conquest was the most productive in the early stages of his career: in 1875, for instance, they worked together on <span class="italic">Dead to the World</span> and <span class="italic">Sentenced to Death</span> at the Grecian Theatre, and they continued their partnership in the following year with <span class="italic">Snatched from the Grave</span> and <span class="italic">The Sole Survivor</span>. They continued to produce plays together until 1879. As the titles indicate, Pettitt favoured melodrama, and his work in the genre was inventive. He also wrote comedies, however, and in 1880 he supplied the Grecian with a pantomime, <span class="italic">Harlequin King Frolic</span>, which was said to have had the longest run of any pantomime of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Pettit's star was rising. On 31 July 1880 <span class="italic">The World</span>, by Paul Merritt, Henry Pettitt, and Augustus Harris, was staged at Drury Lane, and marked the beginning of a very prosperous era both for Pettitt and the playhouse. In 1880 and 1881 Pettitt visited the United States to look after his royalties, and to superintend the production of a version of <span class="italic">Le voyage en Suisse</span>, which he wrote for the Hanlon-Lee troupe. While in America, he became involved in a legal case in Boston concerning the copyright of his play <span class="italic">The World</span>. Pettitt's return to England was followed by increased writing activity, which continued until his death. He began to collaborate to a greater extent with Harris, producing plays such as <span class="italic">A Run of Luck</span> (Drury Lane, 28 August 1886), which was aptly named, as it brought in &pound;25,000 in only twelve weeks. He also worked more extensively with Reade, Sims, and Grundy in this later part of his career. His penultimate play, <span class="italic">A Woman's Revenge</span>, was described by William Archer as a &#145;beautifully symmetrical fable&#146; marred by a &#145;ridiculously wound up&#146; ending  (Archer, 188). <span class="italic">The Life of Pleasure</span>, a drama written with Harris, was his last work and was performed on 21 September 1893.<br>
<br>Pettit's many plays were thought by his contemporaries to show considerable knowledge of dramatic effect, a sense of situation, and general deftness of execution, although the critics also found his characters to be conventional, and largely forgettable. He enjoyed great popular success, however, and managed to accumulate considerable wealth in a few years, while remaining a generous and open-handed man. He died of typhoid fever at Chestnuts, 352 Goldhawk Road, London, on 24 December 1893 and was buried in Brompton cemetery on 29 December.<br>
