<span class="headword">Highton,  Henry</span>  (1816&#150;1874), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and experimenter in telegraphy</span>, was born at Leicester on 19 January 1816, the eldest son of Henry Highton of that town. He was educated at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold, with whom he remained friendly for a number of years afterwards. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 13 March 1834 and graduated BA, with a first class in classics, in 1837. He proceeded MA in 1840 and was Michel fellow of his college in 1840&#150;41. In the same year he began tutoring the mathematician Henry Smith (1826&#150;1883).<br>
<br>On 16 June 1841 Highton married Elizabeth, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21632/', "James Paxton (1786&#150;1860)")</script>. In the same year he was appointed assistant master at Rugby School. While at Rugby, in 1842, Highton had printed a letter addressed to Sir Moses Montefiore which offered some advice as to the recovery of the Israeli &#145;nationality lost for 1800 years&#146;. In 1849 he published some sermons and, in 1851, a <span class="italic">Catechism of the Second Advent</span>. In 1859 he moved to Cheltenham College as principal. He served in that office until 1862, in which year he published a revised translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. In 1863 he published a letter to the lord bishop of London criticizing the Athanasian creed. His last theological work was <span class="italic">Dean Stanley and Saint Socrates, the ethics of the philosopher and the philosophy of the divine</span> (1873), an attack on Arthur Stanley (1815&#150;1881) for his &#145;consistent opposition to evangelical truth&#146;. In the same year Highton published a translation of some of Victor Hugo's poems.<br>
<br>In addition to his interests in education and theology Highton conducted a number of practical experiments in the application of electricity to telegraphy. In the mid-1840s he purchased the rights to exclusive use of a gold leaf instrument which he adapted for telegraphic purposes (it was used for a number of years in Baden). By the early 1870s he believed the sensitivity of the instrument would enable it to allow transatlantic communication along uninsulated underwater wires, a development which would greatly cut the cost of cable laying then being undertaken, allowing &#145;the poor emigrant to communicate with his family &hellip; and put an end to the necessarily almost prohibitory rates which at present prevail&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span>, 20, 1872, 509). His 1872 paper on the subject was well received, and the Society of Arts presented him with their silver medal for it. However, Highton's experiments had been largely conducted in fresh water and by 1873 he had to concede that such a system would not work in a saline medium. He instead began campaigning for the adoption of a cheap method of insulation he had developed using vegetable tar and lead oxides.<br>
<br>In improving his gold leaf instrument for telegraphic purposes Highton had also done research into galvanism and the improvement of batteries. He produced several new types of battery, one of which (a type of zinc carbon battery) found much favour among electroplaters. His patents in the field were purchased about 1873 and the Highton Battery Company set up to work them. He also patented an artificial stone which for some years was popular for paving and building purposes.<br>
<br>Highton spent his last years in Putney, London. He died at his home there, The Cedars, on 21 December 1874; he was survived by his wife.<br>
