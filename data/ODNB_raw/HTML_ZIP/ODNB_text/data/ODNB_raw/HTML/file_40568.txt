<span class="headword">Walsh,  John</span>  (1665/6&#150;1736), <span class="occ">music publisher and musical instrument maker</span>, was probably of Irish ancestry. He appears to have been established in London in the early 1690s, and on 24 June 1692 was made musical instrument-maker-in-ordinary to William III, succeeding John Shaw in that post. He married Mary Allen on 28 January 1692 at St James Duke's Place, London; they had fifteen children, of which three survived infancy. His first child was baptized at St Mary-le-Strand on 26 January 1693. His son <a name="cosubject_40569"></a><span class="headword">John Walsh</span>  (1709&#150;1766)<span class="occ"></span>, born in London on 23 December 1709, eventually assumed control of the family businesses. Although the elder John Walsh's address in 1692 seems to be unknown, from 1695 to 1736 his residence is noted as being the Golden Harp and Hautboy, Catherine Street, Strand. Works published at this address from 1730 onwards generally carry the imprint &#145;Printed for and sold by John Walsh Musick Printer and Instrument maker to his Majesty at the Harp and Hoboy in Catherine-street in the Strand&#146;. Later this was shortened slightly, and by the time his son took over the business the usual form was &#145;Printed for J. Walsh in Catherine Street in the Strand&#146;.<br>
<br>John Walsh senior began publishing in 1695, and his business soon flourished owing to the vacuum created in the market by the demise of John Playford's business. Walsh's earliest publications often come with highly ornamental engraved titles and frontispieces, some of which were reused for different works. From the 1710s, after apparently establishing a link with &Eacute;tienne Roger of Amsterdam, Walsh's publications occasionally utilize Roger's original plates along with his own imprints. His own publications eventually saw the replacement of copper plates by cheaper pewter plates, and the replacement of engraving by the use of punches. Up to 1730 most of Walsh's publications include the name of John Hare of Cornhill, who provided city premises for his business. In addition to this association, Walsh appears, in October 1708, to have become a partner of Peter Randall, who presumably married Walsh's sister. Randall evidently gave up his own shop in 1709 and apparently remained with him until 1710. The Randalls' involvement in the Walsh family business continued through William Randall (<i>c</i>.1728&#150;1776), who was either Peter Randall's son or his grandson. Upon the death of his cousin John Walsh junior in 1766, William, along with John Abell, eventually took over Walsh's business, in which they had presumably already been employed.<br>
<br>As a businessman Walsh was unquestionably progressive. He advertised extensively and often used subscription issues and free copies to entice prospective purchasers. His innovations as an advertiser included sponsoring the first publication of music by a periodical, in the <span class="italic">British Apollo</span>'s quarterly supplements in August and November 1709. His generally uncontested pre-eminence in Italian and English opera, as well as in songs and instrumental music, was obviously noticed by Handel, who on his first visit to England in 1710 sought to engage Walsh as the publisher of <span class="italic">Rinaldo</span>. In the event Walsh published the work in 1711 and is said (erroneously) to have made &pound;1500 from the deal. When Handel received a fourteen-year monopoly for the publication of his own works in 1720, Walsh was one of the publishers allowed to issue Handel's music on his behalf, and by the early 1730s was handling the greater proportion of the composer's printed music. Despite apparent discrepancies in his estate's true value, Walsh's finances were obviously in good order at the end of his life. He is reported in the <span class="italic">London Daily Post and General Advertiser</span> as having left &pound;20,000 and in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as having left &pound;30,000. His finances did not extend, it would seem, to paying what he believed to be inappropriate taxes. In 1726 he was gaoled for non-payment of the government stamp duty, and he was released the following year. This same recalcitrance was observed by Sir John Hawkins, who claims that Walsh and his partner John Hare were illiterate men, &#145;unable to compose a title-page according to the rules of grammar and too penurious to employ others for the purpose&#146;  (Kidson, 443). Hawkins also writes of their publications as &#145;being, in numberless instances, a disgrace to the science [of music] and its professors&#146;  (ibid.), a statement which is surely unfair, but perhaps reflects the resentment some composers felt towards unscrupulous publishers in the early eighteenth century. Walsh died in London on 12 or 13 March 1736. According to an obituary notice for John Walsh the younger in the <span class="italic">Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser</span> for 23 January 1766, Walsh was buried originally in St Mary-le-Strand in March 1736, only to be moved along with his wife (who had evidently predeceased him) to a new vault prepared in the churchyard.<br>
<br>John Walsh the younger took over the business about 1730, upon the demise of the Walshes' relationship with the Hare family. On 8 May 1731 he became instrument maker to George II, and around this time also began to number his firm's publications. In May 1736 he began publishing Handel's operas by subscription. Walsh excelled in promoting the works of Handel to such an extent that in 1739 he was given a monopoly of his music for fourteen years. Handel's op. 4 concertos are supposedly dedicated to Walsh. Walsh's commercial acumen extended to his role as Handel's editor: he sometimes added extra movements to Handel's work before publication in order to meet the expectations of a fashionable mid-century audience. In 1748 he was elected a governor of the Foundling Hospital, a connection which may have brought about Handel's first benefit concert for the hospital the next year. Walsh consolidated the business by selling the works of other publishers as well as snapping up smaller businesses that had ceased publishing. The excellence of Walsh's engravings of this period is evidenced in the fact that many of the company's apprentice engravers continued in business on their own, including John Caulfield, Thomas Straight, and Thomas Skillern. Walsh died in London on 15 January 1766, and was buried in St Mary-le-Strand. According to Kidson there is no evidence of a memorial there. The business was valued upon his death at &pound;40,000.<br>
