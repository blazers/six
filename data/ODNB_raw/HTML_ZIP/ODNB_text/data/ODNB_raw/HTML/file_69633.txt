<span class="headword">Giordani,  Tommaso</span>  (<em>c.</em>1733&#150;1806), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born probably in or near Naples, Italy, the son of <a name="cosubject_69629"></a><span class="headword">Giuseppe Giordani</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1745&#150;1767), <span class="occ">librettist</span>, and his wife, Antonia (<i>d</i>. 1764), a singer, who formed a travelling opera company in Naples in the 1740s. The company included Tommaso, his brother Francesco, a dancer, and his sisters Nicolina and Marina, both singers. The company played in Ancona and Pesaro in 1745 before moving north to Graz in 1747, Frankfurt and Salzburg in 1750, Amsterdam in 1752, and Paris in 1753, and reached London by the end of 1753. There they performed the comic opera <span class="italic">Gli amanti gelosi</span>, with Giuseppe's libretto, on 17 December 1753 at Covent Garden Theatre. A great success, it was followed by three other comic operas during the winter season. The company performed at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket in 1755 in Giuseppe's new comic opera <span class="italic">L'albergatrice</span>, for which Francesco created the dances, and on 12 January 1754 put on <span class="italic">La comediante fatta cantatrice</span>, with music by Tommaso, at Covent Garden. Nothing more is heard of the family until 1764, when they were invited to Dublin to perform at the Smock Alley theatre. Despite the death of Antonia in Capel Street, Dublin, in October, they opened the season on 24 November 1764 with a new version of <span class="italic">Gli amanti gelosi</span>, with new dances created by Francesco and an overture and three airs composed by Tommaso (the rest of the music was by Galuppi). The cast included Nicolina and Marina. Francesco also contributed the dances for Thomas Arne's <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span>, first performed in Dublin at Smock Alley in February 1765. The family remained in Dublin, performing at the Crow Street theatre until 1767.<br>
<br>Tommaso composed the music for several comic operas at the Smock Alley theatre between 1765 and 1767, including <span class="italic">Don Fulminone</span> (1765), <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mill</span> to Isaac Bickerstaff's libretto (1765), and <span class="italic">Love in Disguise</span> (1766). <span class="italic">Phyllis at Court</span>, his first <i>opera seria</i>, had its first performance on 25 February 1767 at the Crow Street theatre. Giordani remained in Dublin until 1768, when he moved to London following charges of plagiarism, although he returned to Dublin to conduct the 1769 season at the Rotunda.<br>
<br>Giordani settled in London and became closely involved with the King's Theatre, Haymarket, where he directed operas and musical entertainments and composed three new operas: the comic operas <span class="italic">Il padre e il figlio rivali</span> (1770) and <span class="italic">Il bacio</span> (1782), and <span class="italic">Il re pastore</span> (1778), an <i>opera seria</i>. He also composed songs for Richard Brinsley Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Critic</span>, first performed at Drury Lane on 29 October 1779, and wrote popular songs for the concerts at the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, many of which he published. He was also a prolific composer of instrumental music, especially for the keyboard; his works included a set of quintets for harpsichord and string quartet (1771), six keyboard concertos, op. 14 (1776), and his very popular overture to <span class="italic">The Elopement</span>, a pantomime performed at Drury Lane in 1767, which was published in parts about 1770.<br>
<br>Tommaso Giordani returned to Dublin in the summer of 1783 for the season at the Rotunda. With the countertenor Michael Leoni he then created the English Opera House at the Little Theatre in Capel Street in December 1783, opening on 18 December with <span class="italic">Gibraltar</span> and <span class="italic">The Haunted Castle</span>. They intended to put on operas with librettos by Irish writers and music by Giordani, but although the season included seven new works, including his burlesque opera <span class="italic">Orfeo et Euridice</span> and the musical entertainments <span class="italic">The Enchantress</span> and <span class="italic">The Dying Indian</span>, the venture was a financial disaster, and they were declared bankrupt in July 1784.<br>
<br>In 1784 Giordani married one of the daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29430/', "Tate Wilkinson (1739&#150;1803)")</script>, the actor and theatre manager, and he remained in Dublin as composer at Smock Alley for the 1784&#150;5 season and as music director at the Crow Street theatre in 1788. He continued to write for the stage, his compositions including music for the pantomime <span class="italic">The Island of Saints</span>, put on at Smock Alley in 1785. His last opera, <span class="italic">The Cottage Festival</span>, was performed at Crow Street in 1796. Giordani was also a teacher, and his pupils included John Field (1782&#150;1837) and Thomas Cooke (1782&#150;1848). Field's d&eacute;but as a pianist was in one of the &#145;spiritual concerts&#146; organized by Giordani at the Rotunda in March 1792. Giordani was president of the Irish Music Fund from 1794.<br>
<br>Tommaso Giordani died in February 1806 at his home, 201 Great Britain Street, Dublin. The exact date of his death is unknown, but it is recorded that on 24 February the Irish Music Fund made a payment of 5 guineas for his funeral.<br>
<br>Giordani's sister <a name="cosubject_69632"></a><span class="headword">Nicolina Giordani</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1753&#150;1774)<span class="occ"></span> won fame in her role as La Spiletta in <span class="italic">Gli amanti gelosi</span>, first performed at Covent Garden on 17 December 1753, and from then on she took the name Signora Spiletta. In 1764 she accompanied her family to Dublin, where she was very popular, repeating her success in <span class="italic">Gli amanti gelosi</span> at the Smock Alley theatre. She was in London in the 1770s, singing at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, in 1774, and had a reputation as an excellent comic actress. Horace Walpole wrote that &#145;besides being pretty&#146; she &#145;has more vivacity and variety of humour than ever existed in any creature&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.160).<br>
