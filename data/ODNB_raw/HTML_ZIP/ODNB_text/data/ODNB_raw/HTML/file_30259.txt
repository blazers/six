<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young,  Charles Mayne</span>  (1777&#150;1856), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the son of Thomas Young, a surgeon, and his wife, Anna, was born in Fenchurch Street, London, on 10 January 1777. He spent 1786 in Copenhagen with his father's sister Mary, who was married to Professor M&uuml;ller, a court physician of Denmark, and acquired the friendly patronage subsequently maintained of the royal family of Denmark. On his return he was sent to Eton College, where he remained for three years, and afterwards, in 1791&#150;2, to Merchant Taylors' School. Young's father was apparently a brutal and debauched tyrant who treated his family with great cruelty, and finally abandoned his wife for another woman. The entire family took refuge with an unmarried sister of Anna Young, by whom they were brought up with some difficulty.<br>
<br>Young became a clerk in a well-known city house, Loughnan &amp; Co. After playing at one or two small theatres as an amateur he appeared under the name Green at Liverpool in 1798 as young Norval in John Home's tragedy <span class="italic">Douglas</span>. Emboldened by success, he took his own name, and accepted an engagement in Manchester to play leading business. After acting in Liverpool and Glasgow he made his first appearance in Edinburgh in January 1802 as Doricourt in Hannah Cowley's <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>. He played during the entire season, and was taken up by Scott, whose friendship he retained, and with whom he stayed more than once. After returning to Liverpool, Young found as his leading lady Julia Ann Grimani, a descendant of the Venetian family of that name, whom he married at St Anne's Church, Liverpool, on 9 March 1805. Grimani had made her stage d&eacute;but at Bath on 16 April 1800, as Euphrasia in <span class="italic">The Grecian Daughter</span>. Following a season or two in Bath, she was at the Haymarket in 1803 and 1804, where she was Mrs Haller in Benjamin Thompson's <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>, Virginia in James Cobb's <span class="italic">Paul and Virginia</span>, Miss Richland in Goldsmith's <span class="italic">The Good-Natured Man</span>, and Miranda in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busybody</span>. She died at the reputed age of twenty-one, on 17 July 1806, shortly after giving birth to their only son, and was buried in Prestwich churchyard.<br>
<br>Young, who had had some share in management in Manchester and elsewhere, after some negotiations with George Colman, went to London in June 1807, and made his first appearance there at the Haymarket, playing Hamlet. He was also seen as Hotspur, Frederick in <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>, Petruchio in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, Harry Dornton in <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, and Rolla in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>. In the two following seasons he was, among other characters, Zanga in <span class="italic">The Revenge</span>, Leon in <span class="italic">Rule a Wife and have a Wife</span>, and Falkland in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>. Between 1807 and 1809 he was at Bath, appearing as Hamlet, and other leading characters.<br>
<br>In November 1808, as the original Daran in Frederick Reynolds's <span class="italic">The Exile</span>, Young appeared for the first time as a member of the Covent Garden company, then, when the theatre was burnt down, acted at the Haymarket Opera House. With the company he migrated to the other Haymarket house, where he played Othello, Macbeth, and Frederick in Elizabeth Inchbald's <span class="italic">Lover's Vows</span>. His engagement was to support John Philip Kemble, and on occasion to replace him. After the opening of the new theatre in Covent Garden and the suppression of the O. P. (Old Prices) riots (caused by an increase in the price of seats), when eventually <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> was produced, Young's Cassius was as good as Kemble's Brutus, and gradually, as Kemble's performances lessened in number, Young became accepted as the leading English tragedian&#151;until his supremacy was challenged, first by Edmund Kean and then by W. C. Macready. Kean, however, did not appear at Drury Lane until 1814, and by then Young had established himself at Covent Garden in such roles as Antony in <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, Coriolanus, Iago, Richard III, and Macheath in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, as well as comic parts, notably Jacques in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> and Prospero in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. Around this time Young appeared again at Bath, King Lear being his principal role this time.<br>
<br>In October 1822, as Hamlet, Young made his first appearance at Drury Lane, where he divided the lead with Kean, and supported him as Iago and Clytus. The following season he was back at Covent Garden, where he played Sir Pertinax Macsycophant in Charles Macklin's <span class="italic">The Man of the World</span>, one of his most successful roles. In the spring of 1826, supported by John M. Vandenhoff, he played an engagement in Edinburgh. He returned to Edinburgh in 1830 and 1831, and made his last appearance there in April 1831. In spite of tempting offers from America, he decided to retire from the stage while still young. His farewell took place on 31 January 1832 as Hamlet. Macready played the Ghost, and Charles Mathews, for that occasion only, Polonius. Young made a speech declaring that his reasons for quitting the stage were that he felt his strength declining and wished to be remembered at his best. After his retirement he lived principally in Brighton, where he died on 29 June 1856. He was buried in the churchyard at Southwick Green, near Brighton. He had one son, the Revd Julian Charles Young, who wrote his biography.<br>
<br>Young was fond of hunting, and had more than one accident in connection with it. He led a blameless life and was much respected. He was about 5 feet 7 inches in height, had dark eyes and a dark complexion, and was slightly plump. He had an admirable voice and a good presence and favoured the Kemble school of acting. Macready wrote with some emotion on hearing of his death, and said that he and Young disliked but respected each other. Although Young showed some promise as a comic actor, his best parts were said to have been Hamlet, Octavian, Macbeth, Prospero, Cassius, and Daran in <span class="italic">The Exile</span>. The memorialist Hester Piozzi speaks of his Lear affecting her almost to hysterics. In several of these parts Young was openly charged with imitating Kemble, but he was a good deal less self-conscious than Kemble, and he did not have the self-content which characterized the Kemble family. William Hazlitt spoke disparagingly of Young as in general a respectable actor, who seldom gratified and seldom offended. Leigh Hunt, who in many respects admired him, condemned him for being habitually incorrect in his words, except in Hamlet, which he is said to have played with &#145;decent&#146; accuracy. Kean greatly admired him. He had a sort of melodious chanting in delivery, and it was said by some that he was a fine declaimer rather than a fine actor. He had many admirers and friends on the French stage.<br>
