<span class="headword">Kitchiner,  William</span>  (1778&#150;1827), <span class="occ">epicure and writer</span>, was baptized at St Clement Danes, Westminster, in May 1778, the son of William Kitchiner (<i>d</i>. 1794), and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grave. Both parents were originally from Hertfordshire; Kitchiner senior had built up a prosperous business as a coal merchant, operating from a Thames-side wharf below Fountain Court, the Strand, and achieved local eminence as &#145;Justice Kitchner&#146;  (Diprose, 2.28). At his death he left his wife adequately provided for, and his estate (which included property along the Strand at Beaufort Buildings and Fountain Court) in trust for his son.<br>
<br>In later life Kitchiner let it be understood that he had been schooled at Eton and held a medical degree from Glasgow; in fact he had not attended either establishment but by claiming a Scottish medical degree, which barred him from practice in England, he could style himself Dr Kitchiner MD, and as he possessed an extensive library of medical books, this title was not challenged. Being financially independent he was able to marry early. On 3 August 1799 he married Elizabeth Oram, also of St Clement Danes parish, but the couple soon parted, and a subsequent liaison with Elizabeth Gifford led to the birth of a son, William Brown Kitchiner, on 23 June 1804. He was acknowledged by his father, educated at Charterhouse (1818&#150;22), then at St John's College, Cambridge (1824&#150;6), which he left without a degree. In later years Kitchiner lived with Elizabeth Friend, to whom he left his house and a comfortable bequest.<br>
<br>Kitchiner's inheritance permitted him to enjoy, and to write extensively on, those three arts which most pleased him: music, gastronomy, and optics, and these interests were also represented in his library. He composed an operetta entitled <span class="italic">Love among the Roses, or, The Master Key</span>, was author of <span class="italic">Observations on Vocal Music</span> (1821), and a prolific writer of patriotic and sea songs. His interest in culinary matters was wide-ranging. His friend William Jerdan commented: &#145;His medical and gastronomical practices were wonderfully combined, insomuch that his guests could not tell whether what was set before them was a meal or a prescription&#146;  (Jerdan, 282&#150;7). Around 1812 Kitchiner was living near the observatory at Camden Town, but he later settled at 43 Warren Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, where the weekly meetings of his &#145;committee of taste&#146; were attended by the most eminent members of society. They arrived to be greeted by Kitchiner at the piano; their meal might have been prepared with the assistance of Henry Osborne, chef to Sir Joseph Banks; after a stimulating discussion, they were expected to depart promptly at eleven. The most famous of Kitchiner's numerous cookery books, <span class="italic">The Cook's Oracle</span>, first appeared in 1817 and went through many editions, even after his death. It was written in a down-to-earth style, and demonstrated Kitchiner's familiarity with the entire process, from shopping, through preparing and serving the dishes, to cleaning up. It was an acknowledged source of inspiration for Mrs Beeton, and was mined by the writers of other household guides. The related subject of digestion and medical treatment of a more or less purgative nature were subsumed in his <span class="italic">Peptic Precepts</span> (1821), a subject itself included in his exhaustive <span class="italic">The Traveller's Oracle</span> (1827), which covered all conceivable aspects of travel, although Kitchiner himself had never been abroad.<br>
<br>In 1819 Kitchiner was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. A considerable portion of his income was spent on his optical interests. At his death he possessed eighty-nine telescopes&#151;of which several, by the best makers, had been bought at auction from the estates of deceased astronomers&#151;besides numerous opera glasses and several microscopes. Kitchiner frequented opticians' shops, discussing improvements to instruments. He devised about 1820 the &#145;pancratic eye-tube&#146;, which allowed continuous adjustment of focus on the common refracting telescope. His <span class="italic">Practical Observations on Telescopes</span> (1815) went through several editions, and was later expanded into <span class="italic">The Economy of the Eyes</span>, in two volumes (1824). Kitchiner was often accused of plagiarism in his books, and it is true that not all his &#145;borrowings&#146; were acknowledged.<br>
<br>Kitchiner's end was unexpected and in some degree suspect. On 26 February 1827 he dined with his friend John Braham at 69 Baker Street, overstayed his own preferred hour of departure, and on reaching his house suffered a heart attack, from which he shortly died. He was buried at St Clement Danes on 6 March; his son erected a memorial to him in St Pancras New Church. Sothebys auctioned his library and scientific instruments in July 1827. It transpired that Kitchiner had intended to alter his will on the day following his death, because he had come to the conclusion that his son did not deserve to inherit. His timely demise meant that William Brown Kitchiner did inherit; he married in 1828 Georgiana Macdonell, daughter of Major Edgworth of London, and died impoverished at Ostend, Belgium, in 1861.<br>
