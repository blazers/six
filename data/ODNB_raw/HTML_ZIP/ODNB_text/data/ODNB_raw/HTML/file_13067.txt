<span class="headword">Herd,  John</span>  (1511&#150;1584), <span class="occ">doctor and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in February 1511 in Southwark, Surrey. He was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted a scholar in 1529 and elected a fellow in 1532; he graduated BA in 1534. He left Cambridge in 1536, and in 1540 moved to Rochester. But he retained links with Cambridge, proceeding MA probably in 1546, and contributing verses to the volume marking the death of Martin Bucer in 1551. By that time he had trained as a doctor and become physician to Archbishop Thomas Cranmer&#151;in July 1551 he nearly died of sweating sickness at Croydon Palace. He attended the archbishop in Oxford until August 1555, and also took possession of some of Cranmer's books. This did not prevent his conforming in religion under Mary, for though not in orders he was installed as prebendary of Lafford in Lincoln Cathedral on 19 October 1557, and in 1558 was presented to two Welsh benefices. He proceeded MD at Cambridge in the latter year.<br>
<br>Herd conformed under Elizabeth as well, and in April 1559 was installed in the prebend of South Newbald in York Minster. He then demonstrated both his versatility and his ambitions by writing a verse history of England between 1461 and 1509, with a fulsome dedication to Sir William Cecil dated 1 October 1562. Heavily dependent on the histories of Edward Hall and Polydore Virgil, and probably also using at least one London chronicle, Herd's work survives in two full texts (one of them published by the Roxburghe Club in 1868) and a heavily revised account of the reign of Henry VII. Historically its value is slight, and Herd himself suggested that its principal value lay in its being written in verse, and therefore more pleasing to the ear than a work in prose. A passing allusion to storm damage to St Paul's Cathedral late in Henry VII's reign prompted a reference to the disastrous fire of 1561, leading to a eulogy of Queen Elizabeth as the defender of true religion and liberty against Roman tyranny. But the trumpet Herd was most anxious to hear blown was probably his own, for his text is prefaced by a number of verses in praise of himself by former Cambridge colleagues.<br>
<br>No preferment resulted from his approach to Cecil, though it may have served to remind the queen's secretary of Herd's existence, for on 14 April 1563 he wrote requiring him to deliver up &#145;certain collections and common place notes made by the late Archbishop Cranmer&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1547&#150;80</i>, 222); five or six volumes were accordingly surrendered. Thereafter Herd pursued an ecclesiastical career. Ordained priest by the bishop of Lincoln on 1 June 1564, on 13 September 1565 he was instituted rector of Waddington, where he was recorded in 1576 as a conscientious resident clergyman. He also continued to act as a medical practitioner. No doubt it was for his parishioners that he prepared treatments to draw out thorns, heal people bitten by mad dogs, and cure murrain in &#145;beastes&#146;. He also moved in more exalted circles, presumably in Lincoln Cathedral close, where he retained his prebend. He attended a number of cathedral dignitaries&#151;in May 1582 the precentor and the chancellor both received purges&#151;together with lay eminences such as Lord Sheffield, Sir Edmund Peckham, and Lady Wingfield. He also borrowed recipes for medicines, including an eye-water provided by Mrs Aylmer, wife of the future bishop of London.<br>
<br>Herd died in December 1584, probably at Waddington and most likely on the 21st. He was buried at Waddington and was commemorated in his church by a brass inscribed with verses showing every sign of having been written by their dedicatee. They acclaimed him as doctor, minister, historian, and author of a verse catechism to teach Christian doctrine to the young, and declared that Herd's achievements would bring him an enduring fame. The catechism has not survived, while both church and brass were destroyed in the Second World War.<br>
