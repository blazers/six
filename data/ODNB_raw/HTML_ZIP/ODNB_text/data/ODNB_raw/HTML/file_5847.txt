<span class="headword">Cole, Sir  Christopher</span>  (1770&#150;1836), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, born at Marazion in Cornwall on 10 June 1770, was the sixth and youngest son of Humphrey Cole of Marazion and his wife, Phillis, daughter of Francis Maugham. He entered the navy in 1780 as midshipman on the <i>Royal Oak</i> (Sir Digby Dent), where his second brother, John Cole (afterwards rector of Exeter College, Oxford), was chaplain. In the same year he was moved to the <i>Raisonnable</i> and he later served in the <i>Russell</i> and the <i>Princessa</i>, flagship of Sir Francis Samuel Drake. The <i>Princessa</i> formed part of Sir Samuel Hood's fleet in the actions off Martinique and the Chesapeake on 29 April and 5 September 1781. She was also present at Hood's manoeuvres off St Kitts in January and February 1782, and in Admiral Sir George Rodney's battles of 9 and 12 April.<br>
<br>At the peace of 1783 Cole joined the <i>Trepassey</i> (12 guns), commanded by his brother Captain Francis Cole, and accompanied him from the West Indies to Halifax, where he moved into the sloop <i>Atalante</i>, under Captain Thomas Foley, where he remained until 1785. In the following year he proceeded to Newfoundland in the <i>Winchelsea</i> (32 guns), under his idol and fellow Cornishman Edward Pellew. In this vessel he remained until 1789, when, in consequence of the recommendation of Sir Francis Samuel Drake, he was placed on the <i>Crown</i> (64 guns), under Commodore William Cornwallis, with whom he proceeded to the East Indies.<br>
<br>On 18 September 1793 Cole was promoted lieutenant, and in October 1794 he was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Cerberus</i>, a new 32-gun frigate, at the particular request of the captain, John Drew. In the following year he joined the <i>Sanspareil</i> (80 guns), bearing the flag of Lord Hugh Seymour. In 1799 he accompanied Seymour to the West Indies as his flag-lieutenant. Having been promoted to commander on 30 January 1800, Cole was, on the surrender of Surinam in August 1800, appointed commander of one of the prizes, the <i>Hussar</i>, a corvette of 20 guns, which was renamed the <i>Surinam</i>. In this command he distinguished himself by his activity in pursuing privateers and by his care for his men's health, which Seymour made the subject of an official recommendation to the Admiralty. He gained the good opinion of Seymour's successor, Sir John Thomas Duckworth, who promoted him into his flagship, the <i>Leviathan</i> (74 guns), and afterwards to command the frigate <i>Southampton</i>. His post commission was confirmed by the Admiralty on 20 April 1802.<br>
<br>After the peace of Amiens in 1802, the <i>Southampton</i> was ordered home and paid off in September. In June 1804 Cole was appointed to the <i>Culloden</i> (74 guns), the flagship of his old friend and commander Sir Edward Pellew, who had been appointed commander-in-chief in the East Indies. On 25 September 1806 he captured the French corvette the <i>&Eacute;milien</i>, and on 27 November assisted the destruction of thirty Dutch vessels in the Batavia Roads. However, during this period, relations with Pellew suffered a complete breakdown. In March 1807 Cole was transferred from the flagship to the temporary command of the frigate HMS <i>Salsette</i>, subsequently renamed the <i>Doris</i>. There followed a long and tortuous correspondence in which Cole pressed his claims both with Pellew and directly with the Admiralty for a permanent appointment in a vessel of equal or superior rate. In April 1808, in command of the <i>Doris</i> and two other frigates, he escorted Colonel John Malcolm to Bushehr on his mission to the Persian court, and remained at Bushehr to protect the embassy. On his return he received the thanks of the governor-general in council and a present of &pound;500. Yet such was the state of relations with Pellew that Cole found himself facing a letter of censure for quitting his post in the Persian Gulf without orders. During 1808 and 1809 he cruised in the straits of Malacca and the China seas. On the arrival of the news of the political changes in Spain, he was dispatched by Pellew's successor, Rear-Admiral Drury, to conciliate the governor of the Philippines, in which he was successful.<br>
<br>In 1810 Cole was moved at his own request into the <i>Caroline</i> (36 guns), and was soon after dispatched to relieve the garrison at Amboyna in command of a small squadron: the <i>Caroline</i>, the <i>Pi&eacute;montaise</i> (38 guns), the 18-gun brig sloop <i>Barracouta</i>, and the transport brig <i>Mandarin</i>. He left Madras on 10 May and arrived on 30 May at Prince of Wales Island, where he decided to make a daring raid to capture Neira, the chief of the Banda Islands. With less than 200 men he captured the island and its garrison of nearly 700 Dutch troops on 10 August. On his return to India, Cole received the thanks of the governor-general in council, the commander-in-chief, and the lords of the Admiralty. He was awarded a medal by the Admiralty, and his action was the subject of a public order from the governor-general to the three presidencies. In the House of Commons Spencer Perceval described the enterprise as &#145;an exploit to be classed with the boldest darings in the days of chivalry&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1811 Cole joined Drury on the Malabar coast, where an expedition against Java was being prepared. On the death of Drury, Cole was left in command for some months until the arrival of Captain William Robert Broughton. The expedition sailed in June and, on its arrival at Java, Cole again distinguished himself by promptly landing troops on his own responsibility before the enemy was prepared, thus avoiding considerable loss. In 1812 the <i>Caroline</i> was paid off, and on 29 May Cole was knighted and presented with a sword by his crew. On 10 June he received an honorary DCL from Oxford University, and subsequently was presented with a piece of plate of the value of 300 guineas by the East India Company.<br>
<br>Early in 1813 Cole was appointed to the <i>Rippon</i>, a new vessel of 74 guns. He continued cruising in the channel until the end of 1814, when he was put out of commission. On 2 January 1815 he was nominated KCB. He also received Austrian and Russian orders. On 28 April 1815 he married Lady Mary Lucy Talbot (<i>d</i>. 3 Feb 1855), to whom he had long been attached; she was the daughter of Henry Thomas Fox-Strangways, second earl of Ilchester, and widow of Thomas Mansel Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1813) of Margam Park, Glamorgan; they had no children. Talbot had had a considerable interest in Glamorgan (the estate was held in trust for his young heir, Christopher Talbot) and this was the cause of Cole's entry into parliament. Invited by leading county interests, on 6 December 1817 &#145;the conqueror of Banda&#146; was elected, unopposed, MP for Glamorgan. He did not sit in the parliament that met in 1818, but he was again elected on 16 March 1820, and retained the seat until 1830. An independent, he made no mark in the Commons. In 1830 he made way for his stepson Christopher Talbot. In July 1821 he was elected deputy grand master of the freemasons of south Wales. In 1828 he was appointed to command the yacht <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, and in 1830 he was nominated colonel of marines. Cole lived at Killay, and died there on 24 August 1836.<br>
