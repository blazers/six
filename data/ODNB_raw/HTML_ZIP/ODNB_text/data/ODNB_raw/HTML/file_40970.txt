<span class="headword">Wormell,  Richard</span>  (1838&#150;1914), <span class="occ">mathematics writer and teacher</span>, was born on 17 September 1838 at Humberstone Gate, in Leicester, the eldest son of Robert Wormell, a slater, and his wife, Mary <i>n&eacute;e</i> Joyce. Nothing is known of his social circumstances and early education except that the journals of the mathematician Thomas Archer Hirst refer to him as a former mason and bricklayer. In his early twenties Wormell moved to London to become a pupil teacher at the Borough Road Normal College, Southwark, where his interest in geometry was consolidated. In 1865, while teaching at an elementary school in Westminster, he gained the external BA degree of the University of London. At this time he lodged with the mother of William Barrett, who was then assisting John Tyndall at the Royal Institution. Barrett's conversations fired Wormell's scientific interests and inspired him to develop a mathematical theorem concerning Foucault's pendulum. Barrett took the proof to Tyndall, who showed it to his friend, Hirst. Impressed, Hirst became Wormell's patron, encouraging him to take the London MA degree in mathematics, for which he obtained top marks and a gold medal in 1866. In the same year Wormell was appointed mathematics instructor and deputy headmaster of the new Central Foundation School in Finsbury, whose establishment was being funded by city banks, merchants, and guilds to prepare &#145;scholars for the practical way of life&#146;. No Latin was taught, and because the curriculum emphasized science, technology, commerce, and languages, the teaching of mathematics was particularly central. Undeterred by heavy teaching responsibilities, Wormell gained an external BSc degree in 1868. In the same year, when the foundation stone for the school's permanent building in Cowper Street was laid, Wormell's teaching was publicly commended. In 1868 he also published textbooks on plane geometry and arithmetic, the first of his twenty-five textbooks. These books were all characterized by their child-centred, Pestalozzian approach. In teaching geometry, for example, its applications had to be studied alongside logical demonstrations which, controversially, avoided the Euclidean order of proof.<br>
<br>In 1870 Wormell married Dora Gildon Guy, only daughter of J. Guy of Twickenham; they had five sons and three daughters. Wormell spent 1873 with Hirst teaching mathematics at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, only to return to the Cowper Street School as the unanimous choice for the vacant headmastership in 1874. During his tenure, which lasted until his retirement in 1900, he was very active as an educationist. He was a founding member of the reforming Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching in 1871; he was a council member of the College of Preceptors from 1875, its president in 1905&#150;8, and the editor of its <span class="italic">Educational Times</span> from 1883 to 1893. He was one of only two headteachers to serve on the Bryce royal commission on secondary education in 1894&#150;5, and was president of the Headmasters' Association in 1895&#150;6.<br>
<br>In 1875 Wormell persuaded J. P. Gassiot to endow his school with workshops and laboratories for teaching mechanical and electrical engineering. Evening classes conducted at the Cowper Street School helped inspire T. H. Huxley's report on technical education for the City and Guilds Institute in 1877. In November 1879, what was to become the City and Guilds' Finsbury Technical College was launched in the school's workshops by H. E. Armstrong and W. E. Ayrton. To Wormell's intense disappointment, however, it was the electrician S. P. Thompson who was made principal of Finsbury College in 1885.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1900, Wormell lived at Roydon in Essex, where he died at his home, The Grange, on 6 January 1914. His wife survived him.<br>
