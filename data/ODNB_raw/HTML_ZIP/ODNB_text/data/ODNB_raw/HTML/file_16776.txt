<span class="headword">Lister <span class="st"> [Litster]</span>,  Geoffrey</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1381), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, has been the subject of much confusion over his identity. Walsingham wrongly states that he was called John and that he was a Norwich dyer, while Froissart says that his name was William and that he came from Stafford. He was in fact a dyer from Felmingham, near North Walsham, Norfolk. He paid 6<i>d</i>. in the poll tax of 1379, and is described in the tax records as a &#145;lestere&#146; or dyer. He had a wife called Agnes. He possessed at the time of his death goods and chattels worth 33<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., and held half an acre of land from the duchy of Lancaster. He was the most prominent rebel leader in Norfolk during the rising of 1381, when his actions displayed a political and tactical acumen comparable to that of the better-known rebel leader in Kent, Wat Tyler.<br>
<br>The first outbreaks of insurgency in Norfolk in 1381 occurred in west Norfolk, beginning with the appearance of Suffolk rebels at Thetford on 14 June 1381 and culminating in the sack of houses belonging to John Reed, a poll tax collector, at Rougham on 18 June. During this time proclamations were made in Lister's name urging people to rise in east Norfolk, but there is no record of any major incident there before 17 June, when a great force of rebels assembled on Mousehold Heath outside Norwich. Lister was already established as the leader of this band. His lieutenants included two disaffected members of the local gentry, Sir Roger Bacon and Thomas, son of Sir Thomas Gissing. While they were at Mousehold, the rebels killed three men they had captured: Reginald Eccles, a local justice of the peace, Sir Robert Salle, a notable military leader, and John Newlyn, a serf of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1399). The insurgents burst into Norwich and sacked houses there. On 18 June Lister led his force to Yarmouth, where they forced the burgesses to hand over a charter that gave the town a monopoly over the local herring trade and control of the port of Kirkley Road. Lister and his followers cut the charter in two, sending one part to their fellow rebels in Suffolk. Houses belonging to William Ellis and Hugh Fastolf, the most powerful of the Yarmouth burgesses and the customs collectors there, were attacked and records destroyed. A proclamation was made in the name of Lister and Bacon at Kirkley Road against the collection of customs in the port. On 19 June, perhaps after Lister had left the town, the gaol was attacked, and three Flemings held there were killed. Lister returned towards North Walsham, attacking the manor of John of Gaunt at Gimingham. Lister appears to have assumed some kind of judicial authority. Thomas Soppe was arrested for attacking property of the abbot of Dereham at Holkham, but was released because Lister said he approved the act. Then on 21 June, at Thorpe Market, Lister received a bill naming the parson of Thursford and others as traitors, and also heard an appeal for help in destroying the records of the prior of Binham.<br>
<br>These actions support stories told by Walsingham and repeated, many years later, by John Capgrave. Walsingham claims that Lister tried to capture William Ufford, earl of Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1382), to give authority to his actions. Ufford escaped, disguised as a groom, but five other members of the local gentry&#151;Roger Scales, William Morley, John Brewes, Stephen Hales, and Robert Salle&#151;were forced to ride with the rebels. Walsingham states that Lister called himself &#145;the king of the commons&#146;, and compelled the captive knights to taste his food and drink and to kneel to him in deference. Salle was supposedly killed because he was disobedient. Eventually Lister decided to send Morley and Brewes to try and purchase a charter of manumission from the king with money looted in Norwich. The two knights were accompanied by three of Lister's most trusted men. But when they reached Icklingham near Newmarket they met the bishop of Norwich, Henry Despenser (<i>d</i>. 1406), &#145;a man ideally suited for fighting and armed to the teeth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 2.6). He urged the knights to give up any traitors among them. Emboldened by the bishop's forceful manner, they told him the story of their mission. The bishop seized the three rebels and killed them, and then headed for North Walsham, where Lister was awaiting the return of his envoys. Despenser probably arrived at North Walsham on 26 June. The rebels had fortified their camp outside the town by surrounding it with a ditch filled with stakes. The bishop and his retinue nevertheless overwhelmed the rebels. Despenser&#151;who seems to have been acting without due legal authority&#151;sentenced Lister to be hanged, drawn, and beheaded. He accompanied Lister to the gallows, &#145;thereby performing despite his victory a work of mercy and piety. He held up the rebel's head to prevent it knocking on the ground while he was being dragged to the place of his hanging&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 2.8). Two medieval stone crosses outside North Walsham are said to be associated with Despenser's victory over the rebels.<br>
