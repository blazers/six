<span class="headword">Cumberland,  George</span>  (1754&#150;1848), <span class="occ">writer on art and watercolour painter</span>, was born in London on 27 November 1754, the younger son of the four children of George Cumberland (<i>d</i>. 1771) and his wife, Elizabeth Balchen. In 1769 he became a clerk in the Royal Exchange Assurance Company in London, a post he grudgingly endured until the beginning of 1785. He attended the Royal Academy Schools as an honorary student in 1772 and he was an honorary exhibitor at the Royal Academy in 1782 and 1783. In exhibition reviews for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> from 1780 to 1784 he became a passionate advocate of radical neo-classicism, the art of ancient Greece, and especially of the sculptor Thomas Banks (1735&#150;1805). In 1784 he applied for associate membership of the Royal Academy and was unsuccessful&#151;perhaps because he had been highly critical of the institution. In the same year he received a modest inheritance of &pound;300 per year and by March 1785 he was in Paris. In 1785 and 1786 Cumberland visited Italy, staying in Florence and Rome. He was in Switzerland with Charles Long in August 1786. In 1787 Cumberland eloped with Mrs Elizabeth Cooper, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Price (1758/9&#150;1837), the wife of his London landlord, and until 1790 they lived in Italy, chiefly in Rome. Elizabeth was known as Mrs Cumberland until her death in Bristol on 2 February 1837 at the age of seventy-nine; it is possible that she and Cumberland never married.<br>
<br>Between 1793 and 1798 while living at Bishopsgate, Egham, Cumberland published seven works, including earlier works of poetry, <span class="italic">A Plan for the Improvement of the Arts in England</span> (1793), which included proposals for a national gallery of sculpture in Green Park; <span class="italic">An Attempt to Describe Hafod &hellip; an Ancient Seat Belonging to Thomas Johnes Esq.</span> (1796), of which the map was engraved by the artist and poet William Blake; a fable of utopia, <span class="italic">The Captive of the Castle of Senaar</span> (1798); and the neo-classical treatise <span class="italic">Thoughts on Outline</span> (1796), eight of whose twenty-four plates were engraved by Blake. Cumberland had been a friend of Blake's since 1784. Blake's last engraved work was to be Cumberland's book-plate. Cumberland bought many of Blake's publications, pressed booksellers to take them, and found work for the artist. They shared an interest in experimental painting techniques, and Cumberland may well have influenced Blake's illuminated printing processes.<br>
<br>In 1803 Cumberland moved to Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, before settling at 1 Culver Street, Bristol, in 1807, where he lived until his death. He was elected an honorary member of the Geological Society in 1810, formed a substantial collection of fossils, contributed to the society's journal, and in 1826 published <span class="italic">Reliquiae conservatae &hellip; Descriptions &hellip; of some Remarkable Fossil Encrinites</span>. In Bristol he soon became close friends with the Revd John Eagles (1783&#150;1855), Dr John King (1766&#150;1846), and Francis Gold (1779&#150;1832), all amateur artists with a wide range of sophisticated interests, knowledge, and contacts which were vital to the emergence of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95531', "Bristol school of artists")</script> and, in particular, to the success of Francis Danby. Patronage by purchase was largely beyond Cumberland's means, but he took much trouble helping Bristol artists with introductions to friends in London, particularly Sir Thomas Lawrence, president of the Royal Academy, the artist Thomas Stothard, and Sir Charles Long, later Lord Farnborough.<br>
<br>Cumberland's own watercolours are almost all small landscape studies which, in their direct and determinedly unpicturesque observations of nature, come impressively close to John Linnell's small sketchbook studies of <i>c</i>.1814. It is significant that it was to be Cumberland who, from Bristol, engineered the crucial introduction of John Linnell to William Blake in 1818, through his son George Cumberland junior. Much of the correspondence in the sixteen volumes of Cumberland's letters, now in the British Library, was with his elder brother&#151;Richard Dennison Cumberland (1752&#150;1825), vicar of Driffield, Gloucestershire&#151;and with his own two sons, George and Sydney. The letters have already been a vital source of information for students of William Blake. They remain a rich source for the study of neo-classicism in the 1780s and 1790s and for the understanding of the evolution of the Bristol school of artists in the second and third decades of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Cumberland died at his home, 1 Culver Street, Bristol, on 8 August 1848 and was buried at St Augustine-the-Less, Bristol, on 14 August. His tombstone is now in the churchyard of St George's Chapel, Brandon Hill, Bristol. Some of Cumberland's watercolours are in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
