<span class="headword">Pace,  Richard</span>  (1483?&#150;1536), <span class="occ">diplomat, humanist, and administrator</span>, was probably born in Winchester, Hampshire, in 1483, of parents whose identity is unknown. The Pace family were probably members of the minor gentry. Few details of Pace's early life are known, apart from those revealed in his <span class="italic">De fructu qui ex doctrina percipitur</span> (written in 1517). He had a brother, John Pace, who became customer of King's Lynn, Norfolk.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducationc14831509"></a>Early years and education, c.1483&#150;1509</h2>Pace joined the household of Thomas Langton, bishop of Winchester from 1493 to 1501, and became his amanuensis. He was educated in Langton's <i>domestica schola</i> at his Winchester palace of Wolvesey. Langton sent the musically gifted and academically promising Pace to study <i>bonae literae</i> at the University of Padua about 1498. Pace was not, as traditionally believed, a student at Queen's College, Oxford, before leaving for Italy. Langton provided for his expenses in Italy from about 1498, and his will of 1501 bequeathed &pound;10 a year for seven years further. Abbot de Bere, much interested in the study of Greek, also assisted Pace financially.<br>
<br>Pace was educated by Niccol&ograve; Leonico Tomeo of Padua, Paolo Bombace of Bologna, and Leoniceno of Ferrara in rhetoric, Greek, medicine, Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy, and the natural sciences. He may not have studied in Padua for more than a few years, because by 1501 he was studying at Bologna. He was definitely in Ferrara some time before the end of 1508, when Desiderius Erasmus was his guest. Pace there introduced Erasmus to his good friend Celio Calcagnini, a scholar of Hebrew and of Roman law. Calcagnini would later offer his services to Henry VIII on the divorce issue on Pace's encouragement. Pace, William Latimer, and Cuthbert Tunstall belonged to the second generation of English scholars gathered around the Anglophile Tomeo in Padua. Thomas Lupset, Thomas Starkey, and Reginald Pole constituted the younger generation, and Tomeo's correspondence reveals that Pace acted as their patron in the years 1522 to 1525 when he was in Rome and the Veneto on diplomatic business. Lupset for a time was Pace's secretary.<br>
<br>Pace struck up an enduring friendship with Erasmus, and the latter wrote to him more than to any other correspondent during the period until 1536. Pace said that they spent much time together in study at various places, including Bologna. In 1508 Erasmus praised his expertise in Greek and Latin literature. Pace collected notable classical metaphors and allegories into a companion volume to Erasmus's adages, although it was never published. While in Ferrara, Pace translated the preface to Simplicius's commentary on the Aristotelian <span class="italic">Categories</span>, and at some point was preparing a treatise on arithmetic along Pythagorean and Neoplatonic lines.<br>
<br>Pace's other humanist and, later, diplomatic friendships which were forged in Italy during this time included those with Gasparo Contarini, Pietro Bembo, Marco Musurus, Gianmatteo Giberti, Alberto Pio, Francesco Maria Molza, Niccol&ograve; Guideco, Polydore Vergil, Alexander Alexandrini, Cornelius Agrippa, and Ulrich von Hutten. Through a network of associations he very probably had contact with the Roman Academy of John Goritz and the Aldine circle.<h2>
<a name="Royalservice15091525"></a>Royal service, 1509&#150;1525</h2>Erasmus's efforts to find Pace patronage in the English court in return for kindnesses rendered in Italy bore fruit. Pace entered the service of Christopher Bainbridge, archbishop of York and Henry's newly appointed agent at Rome from the end of 1509. Bainbridge was Langton's nephew. Firmly pro-Venetian and vehemently anti-French in his policies, the bellicose Bainbridge was given the brief to assist in forming a league around Julius II which would drive the French out of Italy (the Holy League). Pace shared his views. For its part the Venetian republic regarded Pace as a learned and virtuous advocate for its interests, who was to be received as a native Venetian rather than a foreign diplomat.<br>
<br>Bainbridge was made a cardinal in March 1511, by which time Pace was his Latin and Italian secretary. Pace's long series of lively and colourful diplomatic dispatches to Henry and Thomas Wolsey dates from September 1513. From 1512 Bainbridge was patron of the important humanist satiric and poetic <i>festa</i> of Pasquino celebrated on 25 April each year. (The statue in the Piazza Navona was dressed as a pagan deity and scurrilous&#151;and frequently obscene&#151;pasquinades attacking the prominent were attached to carpets at its feet.) Pace was among Bainbridge's senior servants who probably assisted the various printers in selecting and editing the Latin and Italian epigrams for the printed collections, and contributed pasquinades of their own. Bainbridge called him his Master Pasquyll. In the spring of 1514 Pace visited England, where he was made archdeacon of Dorset, having taken holy orders before 1 May 1510, when he was made prebendary of North Muskham in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. His friendship with Thomas More probably dates from this time.<br>
<br>Pace attended Bainbridge at the 1513 conclave which elected Leo X, and his experience of this was subsequently used by Henry and Wolsey. The Holy League began to disintegrate as early as October 1513 with Leo's reconciliation with France, and in March 1514 Ferdinand II of Aragon and Sicily and Louis XII signed a truce. Bainbridge's ascendancy in Rome had in fact began to decline from 1512 as a result of double-dealing in the Tudor court, but Pace served him loyally until his death from suspected poisoning in July 1514. Pace, then in Z&uuml;rich, hurried back to Rome to act as Bainbridge's executor; he suspected that Wolsey's agent, Silvestro Gigli, bishop of Worcester, had instigated the crime and strenuously pursued the cause but without result. When Gigli was absolved by a papal consistory Pace acted prudently, and upon the recommendations of the pope and the cardinals accepted the patronage of Wolsey and entered his service. Pace returned to England in April 1515.<br>
<br>Pace had begun researching a history of music in the Vatican library on the urgings of Latimer, but as Bainbridge's sudden death ended his life in Italy it was left unfinished. He did complete and publish a collection of Latin translations of Plutarch and Lucian, <span class="italic">Plutarchi Cheronaei opuscula &hellip; Ex Luciano</span>, with the press of Jacopo Mazzochi in 1514 or 1515, dedicating it to Bainbridge and addressing it to students. It was only the third book by an Englishman ever to be printed at Rome, and the second translation of Lucian by an Englishman (after More). It was both a tribute to Tomeo's interests in teaching Greek, ethics, and rhetoric through the vehicle of Plutarch and Lucian, and a testament of loyalty to Bainbridge. Pace pointedly drew attention to the appropriateness of the essay &#145;How to derive benefit from enemies&#146; for the diplomatist cardinal and described a careworn and anxious Bainbridge denied rest by the demands of serving curia and country. If Pace's diplomatic career had begun auspiciously under Bainbridge it was to become an arduous, frustrating, and health-denying one also. Vergil and Shakespeare (and Fletcher) attributed his final insanity and impoverishment to a jealous Wolsey's desire to keep him away from England and the king's favour on continuous and gruelling ambassadorial duties from 1515 to 1525. He was often adequately provided neither with the necessary salary for conducting negotiations (especially with Maximilian I) nor with full and unambiguous instructions, and so it is not surprising that his missions usually achieved little success. This was especially true of his mission to Switzerland from October 1515 to late 1517. In the wake of Fran&ccedil;ois I's victory at the battle of Marignano against the Swiss, Henry hoped to work with Maximilian and to buy Swiss soldiers in order to counteract the intrigues of the papal and French emissaries. The <span class="italic">De fructu</span> was composed, in an inn in Constance, as a Stoic consolation amid the dangers of diplomatic life, and published hurriedly about January 1518 because, as Pace explained, &#145;I am free by nature but not by choice. For I have bound myself to serve my invincible King as the servant of the wise Cardinal of York. To serve one's country exceeds all freedom&#146;  (Pace, <span class="italic">De fructu</span>, 13). His fears for his life and health were not exaggerated. The French apparently tried to poison him, the Swiss imprisoned him twice as security for the emperor's debts to their soldiers, and he suffered many attacks of fever before his return to London.<br>
<br>Pace had also alternated between periods of elation and depression in 1516, the year in which he became Henry's &#145;primarius secretarius&#146; or principal secretary  (J. S. Brewer, <span class="italic">The Reign of Henry VIII from his Accession to the Death of Wolsey</span>, 2 vols., 1884, 2.64). He was the king's personal secretary and owed his appointment to his energy, connections, ability, fluency in several languages, and experience of foreign travel. As secretary he was in close proximity to the king and wrote almost all his personal correspondence. This relationship gave him great influence over royal patronage and he built a strong rapport with Henry. His appointment did not please all, and several prominent people thought him an odd choice. For his part Maximilian expressed his wonder to Sir Robert Wingfield that the king should use &#145;such a proterve and dyssymulyng persone; for whatsoever he saith now, within an hour he turneth it of another, or rather into twenty divers fashions&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 2/1, 2104).<br>
<br>Pace's writing came under criticism too. Erasmus criticized the <span class="italic">De fructu</span> for its stylistic transgressions and lack of judgement while praising Pace and his scholarship. However, he wrote to Pace in October 1518 saying that the book was read avidly by the Germans, although some in Constance had been offended by being characterized as bereft of learning and fond of drinking. Guillaume Bud&eacute;, Beatus Rhenanus (a likely editor), and Martin Bucer were also initially appreciative. By 1520 at least an <span class="italic">Apologia ad Pacaeum</span> was circulating in Germany and Switzerland. Accepting Erasmus's judgement, twentieth-century commentators were critical of the apparent incoherence and disconcerting shifts in tone and diction of the <span class="italic">De fructu</span>, even attributing this to Pace's mental illness. More recently, however, the work has been re-evaluated. It is a pedagogical miscellany and Menippean satire commissioned for use in the study of Greek and Latin at St Paul's School by Erasmus on behalf of John Colet, to whom it is dedicated. Its literary form accounts for its hybrid and anecdotal presentation, and it has much in common with More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span>, published only months earlier. The <span class="italic">De fructu</span> is one of the earliest statements by an Englishman of humanist methods and theories of education and is the earliest English rhetorical textbook.<br>
<br>For Pace the vital fruit of a humanist education was the provision of counsel to the secular and spiritual realms of Christendom. The <span class="italic">De fructu</span> is highly critical of attempts made to stifle counsel offered in the appropriate courtly, ecclesiastical, or conciliar context. The declamation of each of the liberal arts introduces satire of the papacy, clergy, and courts of Europe of a type even more pointed and specific than that of Erasmus's <span class="italic">Praise of Folly</span> (1511), and this alarmed the ever cautious Erasmus. Pace insinuated a theory of conciliarism against the background of European war and peace, and the failures of the Pisa&#150;Milan and the Fifth Lateran councils to effect reform in the years 1511&#150;17.<br>
<br>Erasmus suppressed Pace's unpublished letter to Martin Dorp, composed while staying with More in Bruges in December 1517. This was not the only occasion on which More and Pace collaborated to defend humanist and Greek studies, and the scriptural methods of Erasmus. Letters of More and Pace to Edward Lee in support of Erasmus were published in the <span class="italic">Epistolae aliquot eruditorum virorum</span> of 1520. In March 1521 More and Pace both attended the court at Abingdon. With the apparent approval of Henry and Wolsey they attacked the Trojans at Oxford. In April 1520 the king offered Pace &pound;10 per annum for a certain lecture in Greek to be read and taught at the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Early in 1518 Pace was reported as occupying the third seat in the secret council and in February was made a gentleman by a grant of arms. He remained in England until May 1519, attending the king at court and travelling from one royal palace to another. On the occasion of the proclamation of the treaty of universal peace of 1518 at St Paul's Cathedral on 3 October, which he had helped to negotiate, Pace delivered a much admired Latin oration before Henry, the two papal legates Wolsey and Lorenzo Campeggi (who was also bishop of Salisbury), and foreign ambassadors, praising peace as the highest good. On 25 October 1518 Pace succeeded Colet as dean of St Paul's. After the death of Maximilian on 12 January 1519 he was sent to Germany on the delicate task of discovering the intentions of the electors while appearing neutral&#151;there were several likely imperial candidates including Henry, Fran&ccedil;ois I, Charles, king of Spain, and Frederick Weftra III, duke of Saxony. If support for election of Henry proved impossible to garner Pace was to press for Charles rather than Fran&ccedil;ois. He arrived on the continent in May 1519 and travelled to the meeting of the Frankfurt diet, where the imperial election was to be held. Pace and Erasmus travelled on together to Brussels, for the former's interview with Margaret of Austria. Charles was elected on 28 June; Pace returned to England at the end of July and was rewarded with many benefices. In 1519 he was made archdeacon of Colchester, Essex, rector of Barwick in Elmet, West Riding of Yorkshire, prebendary of Exeter, vicar of St Dunstan's, Stepney, Middlesex, and prebendary of Finsbury, Middlesex. He was made dean of Exeter in 1522 and later of Salisbury (<i>c</i>.1529&#150;31).<br>
<br>Henry apparently did not perceive, or was not averse to, the strong undercurrents of warning and correction in Pace's 1518 peace oration. He again chose him to deliver a &#145;goodly speech&#146; in Latin to the royal congregation on the manifest benefits of peace at the Field of Cloth of Gold in June 1520, although the text does not survive. In the following year Wolsey had Pace make a copy of Martin Luther's <span class="italic">De captivitate Babylonica</span> for the king. John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, preached in support of the papal bull against Luther, promulgated in London on 12 May amid much ceremony, and Pace produced a Latin translation to be sent to the pope. Nicolas Wilson's preface describes Pace as possessing superlative eloquence and facility in languages, as of much and varied learning, and as a man of candour and integrity  (J. Fisher, <span class="italic">Joannis Fischerii Opera omnia</span>, 1967, 1374). As dean Pace attended the burning of Luther's books at Paul's Cross.<br>
<br>Leo X died on 2 December 1521 and Pace was dispatched to Italy for the first time since 1515 to promote Wolsey's candidature for the papacy. Adrian VI was elected, however, before Pace reached Rome. Pace's <span class="italic">Plutarchi</span> was reprinted in January 1522 in Venice by Bernard dei Vitali, and Plutarch's <span class="italic">De garrulitate</span> and <span class="italic">De avaritia</span> added, the first dedicated to Tunstall and the second to his friend Campeggi. The <span class="italic">De avaritia</span> was issued in a second and corrected edition later the same year. In his preface to Campeggi, Pace explained that it was translated when the pestilence at Rome and his own illness impeded <i>negotium</i>. In 1523 Pace obtained permission from the Venetian senate for the publication of Tomeo's famous translation of and commentaries on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Parva naturalia</span>; its dedication to Pace praises his learning fulsomely. After spending some months in Venice and Switzerland, Pace and his colleague John Clerk were again sent to Rome to support Wolsey's bid for papal election upon the death of Adrian on 14 September 1523. But Clement VII, well known to Pace, was elected. Pace was welcomed back to England with an encomium from John Leland, but was soon ordered to Lombardy to take part in negotiations with Charles Bourbon III, duke of Bourbon, Fran&ccedil;ois's rebellious subject. He remained with Bourbon's army when it invaded France, retreating to Italy after the failure of the siege of Marseilles in September. Once more attempting to persuade the Venetians to fight against the French, Pace shuttled between Brescia, Mantua, and Venice. His dispatches reveal his suspicions that Wolsey had come to a secret understanding with Fran&ccedil;ois and was hence to blame for Henry's failure to send sufficient troops and funds to support Bourbon, and describe the cardinal as having a base nature. Pace himself seems to have supplied credit so that the soldiers were paid and could therefore fight for Bourbon.<br>
<br>The defeat of the French at Pavia on 24 February 1525 may have given Pace much satisfaction, but from 1522 onwards he was frequently seriously ill, attended by the finest Italian physicians, and nursed in Venice and Padua by Tomeo and Pole. In reply to Lupset's description of Pace's unrelieved fever and insomnia Erasmus wrote that he feared that it was his love affairs that were the source of his illness rather than his burdensome diplomatic duties. Pace made few references to women, apart from those to Katherine of Aragon, Margaret of Austria, Lady Darcy, and his sister-in-law, suggesting that he may have been socially awkward in their company. The doge himself urged Pace's recall in October 1525, after Wolsey failed to heed Pace's similar request in March. Pace may have taken some comfort from the birth of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21064/', "John Pace")</script> about 1523.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears15251536"></a>Final years, 1525&#150;1536</h2>Pace arrived in London in November 1525. After some months William Knight became secretary and coadjutors were appointed to administer his deaneries of St Paul's, Exeter, and Salisbury. Pace retired to the Brigettine cloister of Syon at Isleworth, Middlesex, and recovered sufficiently to move back to the deanery of St Paul's only in the autumn. He found solace in a continuation of the scriptural and language studies which had recently occupied him in Italy, such as the translation of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. In 1527 he became involved in a dispute with his friend Fisher over the doctrine of the inspiration of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, and Richard Rex argued that Pace's neglected <span class="italic">Praefatio in Ecclesiasten recognitum ad Hebraicam veritatem</span> was the first sally. It is extant in only two copies, one of which belonged to Pace's friend Thomas Elyot. Pace claimed to have learned Hebrew in one month, and Richard Wakefield said that he taught him Hebrew, Chaldean, and Aramaic in three months while at Syon. Pace's revised <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> is not extant. This intensity of work, study, and debate was central to his character but affected his physical and mental health.<br>
<br>In August Pace presented the <span class="italic">Praefatio</span> to Henry, and during an interview was apparently called upon to give his opinion on the legality of the king's marriage to Katherine. The following day he sent Henry a letter and book written by Robert Wakefield, reader in Hebrew at Oxford, which answered some of the king's counsel, who maintained that <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span> 25: 5&#150;10 annulled <span class="roman">Leviticus</span> 22: 21. Thus was Wakefield drawn into the controversy. Enclosed in the letter Pace sent a Hebrew alphabet to be delivered to Edward Foxe, believing that within the space of one month he would have sufficient knowledge to compare the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to assist Henry to his great advantage. However, for his part Pace appears to have become convinced of the validity of the marriage after discussions with Fisher.<br>
<br>By 1527 Wolsey was actively hostile to one who now seemed a rival for the king's confidences and who was poised for a return to courtly service if his health allowed. A dispatch of 26 October sent by the imperial ambassador, Inigo de Mendoza, bishop of Burgos, reported rumours that Pace had made prejudicial disclosures regarding Wolsey's government to Henry in his absence, and had spoken out in support of Katherine. These reports must be handled with care because Henry's councillors were putting misinformation out at this time. Pace need not have been overtly critical of the divorce to Henry's face. Wolsey may have been behind his fall. He knew that Pace's extensive library of humanist works gathered over many years in Italy was dangerous. Pace had been offended by Julius's behaviour as pope and collected an extraordinary library on conciliarism and anti-papal critique. He made his library readily available to others who supported the divorce, giving them the necessary material to attack Wolsey's careful diplomacy and putting the cardinal in a difficult position. Therefore Wolsey was keener than ever at this critical time, when the momentum for divorce was growing, to remove Pace from power. On Wolsey's return in September he ordered a legal inquiry into Pace's conduct, with the outcome that Pace and some of his servants were committed to the Tower of London. His papers and books were seized although nothing incriminating was found except one which Pace had written on the irregularities of the pope and cardinals. An inventory of Pace's plate was carried out by his own brother at the end of the month. Wealthy from 1519, Pace had a substantial household, with plate and furniture, and was described as taking many servants and goods with him on his embassies.<br>
<br>Anthony Wood claimed that Pace made charges against Wolsey which the king asked him to refute. Instead Pace was tried by Wolsey and Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk. Pace was reported to have been deeply critical of the divorce. People felt the charges against him were dubious, and it is difficult to reconstruct what really happened from the available sources. Fisher himself later seems to have pleaded when he defended himself against Thomas Cromwell for not having revealed the supposed prophecies of Elizabeth Barton, the nun of Kent, that the treasonable sayings of Pace had not been reported by others but were hearsay. Erasmus wrote in August 1528 that Pace had written indiscreetly to Wolsey. This delighted many of Pace's critics at court when it became known, and he was subsequently imprisoned. Anybody too forthright might have been both unwelcome and dangerous in the atmosphere at court in the late 1520s.<br>
<br>On 25 October 1529 Eustace Chapuys, Mendoza's successor as imperial ambassador, wrote to Charles V that Pace was at liberty after two years' imprisonment. Pace probably spent only a short time in the Tower before being entrusted to the care of Thomas Skevington, bishop of Bangor and abbot of Beaulieu, who presumed him incurably insane. Part of the reason for keeping him in custody may have been to monitor his condition during his bouts of illness. He probably spent much of his time at Syon Abbey. He was not always cared for well. Wakefield complained at some point after 1532 to Thomas Boleyn, earl of Wiltshire, about Pace's ill treatment at the hands of &#145;an enemy of his and mine, or rather a common enemy of all&#146;  (H. H. Milman, <span class="italic">Annals of St. Paul's Cathedral</span>, ed. A. Milman, 1869, 185). It has been suggested that this was Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester. Wolsey's treatment of Pace was one of the charges brought against him in 1529. It is poignant to recall that in 1517 Pace had referred to Wolsey as <i>quasi alter deus</i>, almost another God to him, who had preserved his life two or three times and modelled him as a tool to be turned to whatever uses he desired. This ambiguously poised encomium had even then implied that Wolsey was usurping the king's temporal jurisdiction&#151;it was Pace who first described the cardinal as <i>alter rex</i>. Erasmus wrote to Pace to tell him he was delighted by the news that he was safe and restored to his former dignity. He observed that the deity who rescued the innocent and cast down the proud was not asleep.<br>
<br>Pace was recalled to court but retired ill to St Dunstan's, Stepney, in 1530 and remained there until his death in 1536. In Pace's last years John Foxe reported that his condition was &#145;no perpetual frenzy, but came by fits; and the fit was past, he could look on his book, and reason and talk handsomely&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Acts and Monuments of John Foxe</span>, ed. G. Townsend and S. R. Cattley, 8 vols., 1837&#150;41, 4.599). There was a false rumour of Pace's death in 1532. He died on 28 June 1536 and was buried in the church of St Dunstan, near the great altar. Originally a monument and epitaph (preserved by John Weever and incorrectly stating that he died in 1532) marked his burial place.<br>
<br>There is no authenticated image of Pace. However, it is known that he presented himself to the doge of Venice wearing a long gown of satin trimmed with sable and this was said to be his usual attire. Accomplished, witty, and musical, with a great capacity for arousing affection from princes and scholars alike, Pace could also provoke enmity and mistrust. His forthrightness and impulsiveness sometimes impaired his abilities as a diplomat, but the imperial ambassadors considered him the most able and best-informed of Henry's envoys and a possible successor to Wolsey as chief counsellor, if the cardinal became pope. Erasmus and Tomeo regarded him as an outstanding scholar whose time and strength were wasted in public service. In his role as dean of St Paul's School, Pace's <span class="italic">De fructu</span>, oratory, and scriptural studies reveal a principled and reforming spirit, much concerned with education. His periodic and increasingly severe bouts of mental illness (possibly bipolar disorder, despite Erasmus's suspicion that it was syphilis), combined with recurrent attacks of &#145;fever&#146; and gastritis, were eventually to cut short his active political and literary life. His importance as a Tudor diplomat, humanist, and cleric have all been contested by twentieth-century scholars, but he is now re-emerging as a substantial figure worthy of the attention bestowed on him by his contemporaries.<br>
