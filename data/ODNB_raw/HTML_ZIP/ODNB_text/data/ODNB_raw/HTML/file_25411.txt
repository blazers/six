</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shipley,  Jonathan</span>  (1713&#150;1788), <span class="occ">bishop of St Asaph</span>, was baptized in the united parishes of St Stephen Walbrook and St Benet Sherehog, London, on 2 October 1713. It is likely that his birth (in London) preceded this date by only a few days. He was the second, and eldest surviving, son of Jonathan Shipley (1676&#150;1719), stationer, of London, and of Martha Davies (<i>d</i>. 1757) of Twyford House, Hampshire. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25412/', "William Shipley")</script> was subsequently the founder of the Royal Society of Arts. Shipley was briefly apprenticed as a stationer  (Allen, 137, n. 16) and after attending a school at Reading he won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, in 1731. Having migrated to Christ Church he graduated BA in 1735; three years later he graduated MA and took holy orders. In a career move of decisive importance he became tutor to the family of Charles Mordaunt, third earl of Peterborough, and on 1 September 1743 he married the latter's niece, Anna Maria Mordaunt (1716/17&#150;1803). She was celebrated in youth for her beauty and had served as a maid of honour to Queen Caroline (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 13, 1743, 498; Hare, 1.89). They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25413/', "William Davies Shipley")</script>, who was later appointed dean of St Asaph, and five daughters.<br>
<br>Shipley proceeded to acquire substantial ecclesiastical preferment. In 1743 Bishop Benjamin Hoadly appointed him a prebend of Winchester and used his influence to secure him the rectorships of Silchester and of Sherborne St John, Hampshire. In 1745 he served as chaplain-general to the army of William, duke of Cumberland, in the continental campaign that included the defeat at Fontenoy. In 1748 he was made DD at Oxford and a canon of Christ Church. In June 1760 he was appointed dean of Winchester and rector of Chilbolton, Hampshire. In retaining his other livings he was not the only Anglican clergyman who found pluralism to be entirely consistent with latitudinarian principles. During the ministry of Augustus Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton (1768&#150;70), Shipley advanced to the bench. He was consecrated bishop of Llandaff in February 1769 and was translated to St Asaph the following September. At this point he relinquished his other livings with the exception of Chilbolton.<br>
<br>In the House of Lords, Shipley gradually associated with the followers of William Pitt, earl of Chatham, in their criticisms of the administration of Lord North. An &#145;address to the reader&#146; in Shipley's <span class="italic">Works</span> claims that the parliamentary opposition was &#145;a set of men to whom he was a perfect stranger, but who appeared to him to understand, and pursue the true interests of their country&#146;  (2.61). During the 1770s he became very friendly with Benjamin Franklin, whose opinions on the American question he shared, and with the radical dissenters Joseph Priestley and Richard Price  (<span class="italic">Papers</span>, 29.147&#150;9, 407&#150;9, 635&#150;7). In 1773 he preached before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel a sermon in which he described North America as &#145;the only great nursery of freemen left on the face of the earth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.191&#150;2). The sermon was praised by Franklin, and Chatham declared himself &#145;charmed and edified&#146; by it  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 4.302). In 1774, in a speech prepared for the Lords but not delivered, Shipley was strongly critical of the bill for altering the Massachusetts charter, declaring &#145;arbitrary taxation is plunder authorized by law&#146; and &#145;There are methods of making reasonable concessions, and yet without injuring our dignity.&#146; Without condoning the Boston Tea Party he praised the colonists as &#145;coheirs of liberty with ourselves&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.161, 179, 181, 187). At the same time he displayed his latitudinarianism by sympathy with the dissenters. Although in 1772 he voted against the dissenters' bill for relief for their ministers and schoolmasters from the rigours of subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and did not support a similar bill the following year, he spoke in favour of a third relief bill, which was passed in 1779  (Ditchfield, 64, 68&#150;9). In a speech that was widely reported he claimed that the bill did not go far enough and that all legislation against the dissenters should be repealed  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.233&#150;5). He was present in the Lords on 7 April 1778 and witnessed the collapse of Chatham. However, the opposition was consistently outvoted in the Lords as well as in the Commons until the disaster of Yorktown led to the fall of North's ministry in March 1782.<br>
<br>Shipley appeared to be in high favour with the new administration of Rockingham and Shelburne. He urged Shelburne to adhere to his &#145;good principles and your generous views for the public service&#146;, adding: &#145;If you find yourself entangled and embarrassed, like Lord Chatham, in Court artifices, break through the mercenary chains at once, and assert your liberty and honour&#146;  (Hare, 1.87). He urged Shelburne to retain his alliance with Rockingham. In July 1782 Charles James Fox told the duke of Grafton that Rockingham had been &#145;quite decided that Bishops Shipley and Hinchcliffe should have the offer of any opening that presented itself&#146;  (A. H. Fitzroy, duke of Grafton, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. W. R. Anson, 1898, 329). Horace Walpole expected Shipley to be offered the see of Salisbury  (Brown, 324) but Rockingham died on 1 July 1782 and Shipley seems to have quarrelled with Shelburne. None the less when the death of Frederick Cornwallis created a vacancy at Canterbury early in 1783 it was widely believed that Shipley was a serious candidate and there is evidence that Shelburne solicited George III in his favour  (Sykes, 400). The king, however, disapproved of Shipley's political opinions, and the archbishopric was ultimately conferred upon John Moore. Shipley, like Richard Watson of Llandaff, received no further translation.<br>
<br>Thereafter Shipley's attendance in the Lords became more intermittent. He did not vote in the crucial divisions over the <span class="roman">India Bill</span> in December 1783 that brought down the Fox&#150;North coalition. In 1787 he was one of only two bishops who, at a private meeting summoned by Pitt to consider an application from the dissenters, favoured the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>  (Sykes, 341). He shared many of the liberal opinions of Sir William Jones, who married Shipley's daughter Anna Maria and on whose behalf Shipley gave a warm recommendation to Pitt. He maintained a general commitment to mild parliamentary and economic reform, published a relatively small number of sermons, was admired in dissenting circles, and enjoyed a convivial social life at his London residence and at the bishop's palace at St Asaph. Despite their differences over America he also enjoyed the friendship of Samuel Johnson, who had visited him at St Asaph in 1774 and described him as &#145;knowing and conversible&#146;. He belonged to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/49211', "Literary Club")</script> and was on easy social terms with Edmund Burke and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Hannah More recalled a lively evening in his company and that of Horace Walpole  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 31.211). He and his daughter Georgiana kept up an affectionate correspondence with Franklin.<br>
<br>Shipley died at Chilbolton on 6 December 1788 after an &#145;apoplectic seizure&#146; and was buried at Twyford. There is a monument in Twyford church. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, which reported that he died at his London house in Bolton Row, Piccadilly, described him as possessing &#145;learning without pedantry, patriotism without faction and politeness without affectation&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1179). He was survived by his wife, who died on 9 March 1803. Shipley was a man of considerable intellectual gifts, although his published works (despite the two-volume edition published in 1792) were not extensive. Within the Church of England he was a conscientious pastor, according to his own lights and those of his age. He conducted his diocesan visitations regularly and dutifully. Although adhering to orthodox Anglican doctrines he was unperturbed by the development of trinitarian heterodoxy and shared the optimistic assumption that truth would prevail in a free intellectual climate. In political terms he represented an Erastian form of whiggery that had passed from fashion during his later years. In declaring (1779) that religious toleration was a matter for the state rather than the church he showed himself to be an apt pupil of Hoadly. Even before the French Revolution his opinions were becoming marginalized among the Anglican hierarchy.<br>
