<span class="headword">Carey,  Rosa Nouchette</span>  (1840&#150;1909), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Stratford-le-Bow, London, on 24 September 1840, the sixth of the seven children (five girls and two boys) of William Henry Carey (<i>d</i>. 1867), shipbroker, and his wife, Maria Jane (<i>d</i>. 1870), daughter of Edward J. Wooddill. She was brought up in London at Tryons Road, Hackney, and in South Hampstead, and educated at home and at the Ladies' Institute, St John's Wood, where she was a contemporary and friend of Mathilde Blind (1841&#150;1896). As a child she told stories to her younger sister, and in this way created the plot of her first novel, <span class="italic">Nellie's Memories</span> (1868). The publisher's advertisements suggest that it sold over 52,000 copies. It was followed by many other novels, marked by pious tone, domestic subject matter, and a large number of rather unmemorable characters, which were staples of the market in safe fiction for girls during the last third of the nineteenth century. Even Elizabeth Lee, whose many articles on women writers in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> do not display marked feminist sympathies, commented (by implication unfavourably) on how old-fashioned and limited seemed the lives of the women who inhabit Carey's fiction. Yet, gushing and unpretending as her work is, she does depict the frustrations of such women with some sympathy, exploring the pains of living up to high ideals and the psychic cost of self-abnegation. Although she is sometimes described as a follower of Charlotte M. Yonge, in whose magazine, the <span class="italic">Monthly Packet</span>, Carey's novel <span class="italic">Heriot's Choice</span> (1879) was serialized, she is a far less intellectual writer (there is a tincture of high Anglicanism but no theological content), and a less humorous one, and where Yonge's characters belong to the landed gentry, her subject is the lives of women of the urban professional middle class. A saccharine and laudatory biographical collection, <span class="italic">Twelve Notable Good Women of the XIXth Century</span> (1899), includes among its subjects Queen Victoria, Grace Darling, and Elizabeth Fry. The bibliography by Jane Crisp (1989) argues that the British Library catalogue is wrong in attributing to Carey four thrillers which appeared late in her life under the pseudonym Le Voleur.<br>
<br>Carey's literary career got going after the death of her father, when she was in her late twenties. After the death of her mother in 1870 Carey and her remaining unmarried sister went to keep house for a widowed brother and look after his children; after the sister married and went to live in Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland (which provided a setting for some of Carey's fiction), the brother died and Carey was left in charge of the children. As well as writing thirty-three three-volume novels, she was on the staff of the <span class="italic">Girls' Own Paper</span>, for which she wrote eight serials. She does not seem to have moved in literary circles, although she was a close friend of the novelist Ellen Wood (Mrs Henry Wood). The poet Helen Marion Burnside, who also worked for the <span class="italic">Girls' Own Paper</span>, lived with her from about 1875, and edited <span class="italic">The Rosa Nouchette Carey Birthday Book</span> (1901). When Carey's sister was widowed she returned to keep house for the two authors. Rosa Carey died of lung cancer at her home, Sandilands, Keswick Road, Putney, London, on 19 July 1909.<br>
