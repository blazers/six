<span class="headword">Pendlebury,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1731), <span class="occ">army officer and master gunner</span>, first appears in the employment of the Ordnance office in 1695. It is probable that he served during the remainder of King William's war in Flanders until the treaty of Ryswick in 1697, for he was appointed comptroller (at a salary of &pound;45 per annum) of the first train of artillery in time of peace, established in May 1698. This regimental train was composed mainly of those who had served William faithfully in the Nine Years' War. The &#145;peace train&#146; was disbanded in January 1699, to be replaced by a streamlined train (royal warrant, 14 February 1699), in which Pendlebury appears as a captain of fireworkers and petardiers (at a salary of &pound;40) in January 1700.<br>
<br>In 1702 Pendlebury was made comptroller and lieutenant-colonel of the artillery train sent to the Netherlands, and he served continuously throughout Marlborough's campaigns, including Blenheim in 1704, for which he received a bounty of &pound;60. He was appointed chief fire master (at a salary of &pound;150) by the Board of Ordnance in May 1706 and was promoted 2nd colonel of artillery in the Netherlands in March 1708. He retained this rank and that of comptroller during the campaigns of 1709&#150;11. His appointments as deputy governor of the Tower of London in June 1709 and master gunner of Great Britain in November 1710 (at a salary of &pound;190) were assisted by the personal recommendation of the duke of Marlborough, in recognition of his long service with the train. He was placed on half pay in 1715.<br>
<br>Pendlebury's office as master gunner of Great Britain was made redundant by the creation of a new regimental establishment of four companies of gunners in 1716 (the origins of the Royal Regiment of Artillery). He continued to receive quarterly pay of &pound;47 10<i>s</i>. until March 1731. Two final payments were made to his wife, Penelope Pendlebury; after 31 December 1731 all payments ceased. The presumption is that he was ill towards the end of his life and died in the second half of 1731: probate of his will was granted to his widow and executrix on 27 September 1731. Pendlebury was the last officer to bear the title master gunner of Great Britain and England, a line unbroken from 1485.<br>
