<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Denne,  Henry</span>  (1605/6?&#150;1666), <span class="occ">General Baptist minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Well, Ickham, in Kent, the son of David Denne, gentleman. He matriculated at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1621, graduated BA in 1625, and proceeded MA in 1628. At an unknown date he married Roberta, whose surname is unknown; they had four sons and a daughter. After ordination in 1630 at St David's Denne was curate at Pirton, Hertfordshire, for about ten years. Latterly Denne's disputatious printed works led to controversy with other ministers. His <span class="italic">Grace, Mercy, and Peace</span> (<i>c</i>.1640) and <span class="italic">Seven Arguments to Prove &hellip; God Doth Justifie his Elect</span> (1643), evoked a charge of antinomianism from &#145;D. H.&#146; in <span class="italic">An Antidote Against Antinomianism</span> (1644). His visitation sermon at Baldock, Hertfordshire, on 9 December 1641, critical of fellow clergy (<span class="italic">The Doctrine and Conversation of John Baptist</span>, 1642, to which was added <span class="italic">A Conference between a Sick Man and a Minister</span>), brought similar charges from Thomas Rotherham in <span class="italic">A Den of Theeves Discovered</span> (1643) and Samuel Rutherford in <span class="italic">A Modest Survey</span> (1648). The heresiographer Thomas Edwards also considered Denne &#145;a great Antinomian, a desperate Arminian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gangraena</span>, 1645, 1.76).<br>
<br>By 1643 Denne had adopted Baptist views and joined the Bell Alley General Baptist Church in London under the ministry of Thomas Lamb the soap boiler and future Leveller. The church sent Denne as an evangelist into Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdonshire, where he established congregations at Fenstanton and Warboys. He was presented to the living at Eltisley, Cambridgeshire, probably in 1643, by the family of Major-General John Desborough, the brother-in-law and associate of Cromwell. In the following year, however, the Cambridge committee for providing preaching ministers had him imprisoned for preaching against infant baptism, but he was removed to London, detained at the Peter-house (Lord Petre's house in Aldersgate Street), and released. In spite of his experience, Denne's <span class="italic">Antichrist Unmasked in Two Treatises</span> (1645), included not only <span class="italic">The Man of Sin Discovered</span>, who was said to fill English pulpits, but also <span class="italic">The Foundation of Christian Baptism Discovered and Rased</span>, which attacked paedobaptist works by Stephen Marshall and Daniel Featly, a fellow detainee at Peter-house.<br>
<br>In 1645 Denne preached in London and at Rochester, Chatham, and Canterbury in Kent, and the next year he was arrested in Spalding, Lincolnshire, for baptizing four persons in the river. On this occasion he identified his home as at Caxton near Eltisley and admitted to preaching four times, but not baptizing, at Spalding. In 1646 he added <span class="italic">The Drag-Net of the Kingdome of Heaven</span> to his earlier work to produce <span class="italic">Antichrist Unmasked in Three Treatises</span>. Denne's argument in <span class="italic">Drag-Net</span> that Christ died for all, and his use of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> concept of &#145;light&#146; have been seen as advancing the Quaker doctrine of the inner light two years before George Fox did, but this now appears doubtful.<br>
<br>In 1647 Denne joined the parliamentary army as cornet in Colonel Adrian Scrope's regiment of horse. He participated with Levellers in the mutiny of May 1649, marching from Salisbury to Burford, where Cromwell crushed the uprising. Denne and three others were to be executed, but upon his recantation he was spared. As with his earlier release from Peter-house, Denne's association with the Desboroughs perhaps contributed to his pardon. In <span class="italic">The Levellers Designe Discovered</span> (1649) he criticized impetuous actions of mutinous Levellers who then responded by denouncing &#145;the most Trayterous assertions&#146; of &#145;that wretched <i>Judas</i> <i>Den</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Levellers &hellip; Vindicated</span>, 1649, 8). By 1653 Denne was again active at Fenstanton but the next year was sent by the congregation to live and minister in Canterbury at the request of Baptists there. In London in 1658 he publicly debated with Peter Gunning on infant baptism, but also displayed wider concerns. In <span class="italic">The Quaker No Papist</span> (1659) he came to the defence of Friends, arguing against Cambridge University librarian Thomas Smith (who later rebutted him in <span class="italic">A Gagg for the Quakers</span>, 1659) that they were papists because they refused oaths. Denne also defended John Bunyan's right to preach and urged greater toleration for Roman Catholics. Finally, in <span class="italic">An Epistle Recommended to All the Prisons</span> (1660) he argued that Christians could lawfully take oaths and thus many needlessly languished in prisons, provoking counter-arguments from the Baptist Henry Adis in <span class="italic">A Fanaticks Testimony Against Swearing</span> (1661) and the Quaker Samuel Fisher in <span class="italic">One Antidote More</span> (1660).<br>
<br>Denne was among thirty Baptist signatories to <span class="italic">The Humble Apology</span> (1661) denouncing Venner's Fifth Monarchist rebellion. He eventually settled in Rochester where in 1666 he died. His will of 1 June 1666, which gives his age as sixty-one, requested burial in his parish church of St Margaret, Rochester, but he was in fact interred at Rochester Cathedral on 4 August. The will also provided 1<i>s</i>. for each of twenty poor widows, 10<i>s</i>. to his oldest son John (church elder at Fenstanton), 5<i>s</i>. to each of John's four children, 10<i>s</i>. to each child of Denne's deceased son, David, &pound;100 and half his goods to his wife, and his books to his youngest son, Thomas, who was named executor. As a Church of England priest turned Baptist, Denne had, with unusually broad sympathies, supported some of the principles or practices of Levellers, Quakers, and Roman Catholics, and in such a manner as to justify his own conclusion of 1645 that &#145;<i>The Lord hath sent me as</i> a man of contention&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Man of Sin Discovered</span>, A2<i>v</i>). His epitaph, however, read only:<blockquote>
<div>To tell his wisdom, learning, goodness, unto men,<br>
</div>
<div>I need to say no more; but, Here lies Henry Denne.<br>
</div> (Taylor, 1.222)</blockquote>
