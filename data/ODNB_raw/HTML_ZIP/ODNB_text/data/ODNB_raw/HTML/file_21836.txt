<span class="headword">Pendleton,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1557), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, came from a Lancashire family. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, about 1538, graduating BA on 16 November 1542, MA on 18 October 1544, BTh in 1552, and DTh on 18 July 1552. He was fellow of Brasenose from 1542 to 1554, vice-principal 1551&#150;2, and senior bursar 1553&#150;4. During Henry VIII's reign he preached against Lutheranism, but during Edward VI's reign he held protestant views, being one of the first itinerant preachers appointed by the earl of Derby to preach in the provinces. In 1552 he was appointed rector of Blymhill, Staffordshire, though the title was successfully disputed. Foxe records how, after the accession of Mary, Pendleton encouraged Laurence Saunders to stand firm in his protestant opinions, and boasted of his own steadfastness, declaring &#145;I will see the uttermost drop of this grease of mine molten away, and the last gobbet of this pampered flesh consumed to ashes, before I will forsake God and his truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 6.629). Yet he soon converted, being rewarded with several preferments in 1554: he was made prebendary of Reculverland, canon of St Paul's (11 April), vicar of Todenham in Gloucestershire, and canon of Lichfield (15 June). He was also made prebendary of Ufton <i>ex parte decani</i>.<br>
<br>In 1555&#150;6 Pendleton was made vicar of St Martin Outwich, London, which he resigned on 1 April 1556, being admitted to the living of St Stephen Walbrook. About this time he became chaplain to Bishop Bonner, and some of his disputations with those imprisoned for heresy were recorded by Foxe, including an encounter with John Bradford, in which Foxe portrayed him as somewhat confounded by Bradford's appeal to his former reformed convictions. Pendleton was famous as a preacher. A Spital sermon he preached on Easter Monday 1557, attended by mayor, alderman, and judges, had an audience allegedly 20,000 strong. During a Paul's Cross sermon on 10 June 1554 someone fired a gun at him, although Strype remarks that it was not clear &#145;whether it were done by some out of detestation of Pendleton's doctrine, or his person&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Memorials</span>, 3.1.213). The shot missed.<br>
<br>Pendleton was one of the &#145;chapleynes, and frendes&#146; with whom Bishop Bonner compiled the <span class="roman">Book of Homilies</span> in 1555. Pendleton's contributions were &#145;An homelye of the churche, what it is, and of the commoditie therof&#146; and &#145;An homely of the authoritie of the Church declarynge what commoditie and profyt we have thereby&#146;. The first of these emphasized how the true church was universal, visible, and united, &#145;not lurkynge in any corner, or anye one countrye&#146;  (Bonner, sig. H. iv<i>v</i>). The second explained that the two chief elements of the church's authority were the ability to identify and understand scripture, and the power to forgive the repentant and correct the obstinate sinner. This homily stressed the comfort which was to be found within the church and dwelt on the disasters that had befallen England since the schism, including the dissolution of abbeys and chantries and an increase in poverty. Pendleton died in September 1557. Foxe claimed he repented his conversion to Catholicism at the last, but references to a work now lost, entitled <span class="italic">A declaration of Hen. Pendleton DD in his sickness, of his faith in all points, as the Catholic church teachest, against sclanderous reports against him</span> (London, 1557), suggest that this was a matter of some debate. He was buried in St Stephen Walbrook, London, on 21 September 1557.<br>
