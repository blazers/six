</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Higinbotham,  George</span>  (1826&#150;1892), <span class="occ">politician and judge in Australia</span>, was the sixth son of Henry T. Higinbotham, a merchant of Dublin, whose family had left Holland with William III, and Sarah, the daughter of Joseph Wilson, a United States citizen of Scottish descent, formerly American consul in Dublin. He was born in Dublin on 19 April 1826, and educated at the Royal School, Dungannon, whence he went to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1844; he graduated BA in 1848 and MA in 1853. Early in 1847 he went to London, and, while reading for the bar, became a reporter on the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>; he entered Lincoln's Inn in 1848, was called to the bar in 1853, and within a few months sailed for Victoria, where the discovery of gold in 1851 had initiated rapid growth.<br>
<br>In Victoria, Higinbotham again combined the law and journalism; he was admitted to the local bar in March 1854, and on 30 September that year married Margaret Foreman (1835/6&#150;1910), who was born in Kent. In August 1856 he became editor of <span class="italic">The Argus</span>, at that time the most influential newspaper in Australia. As Victorians debated the forms of the limited self-government conferred in 1855, Higinbotham pressed for enlargement of the franchise. In a debate with the proprietor, conducted in the columns of his newspaper, he championed the rapid democratization of colonial politics. In 1859 he resigned the editorship and returned to the bar.<br>
<br>In May 1861 Higinbotham entered political life as member for Brighton in the legislative assembly, describing himself as an independent liberal. In 1862 he lost his seat, but the following year was again elected for the same place. In June 1863 he became attorney-general in Sir James McCulloch's reform ministry, and a leading figure in its contest with the legislative council, the unrepresentative upper house of the Victorian legislature. The contest began when the ministry tacked tariff measures onto an appropriation bill and the legislative council refused to pass the legislation. Higinbotham's stratagem for obtaining supply embroiled Governor Darling, who was recalled by the Colonial Office in 1866. The assembly's vote of a pension to Darling's wife in the same year, and the council's rejection of the appropriation bill containing it, extended the parliamentary deadlock until 1868, when the ministry resigned in protest against the failure of the new governor to recommend the grant to parliament.<br>
<br>Higinbotham's resentment of imperial interference hardened into a conviction that the colony possessed full rights of responsible government over its internal affairs, expressed in resolutions he introduced into the assembly in 1869. While critical of party organization and all other forms of collective politics that diminished the autonomy of the individual, his denunciation of what he called &#145;the wealthy lower orders&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Argus</span>, 24 Oct 1864) who blocked popular aspirations elevated him to heroic status in the liberal pantheon. Meanwhile in 1865 he had consolidated the statutes of Victoria, as he was to do again in 1890, and received the thanks of both houses of parliament.<br>
<br>Higinbotham's other principal concern at this time was educational reform. The colony had maintained a dual system of subsidies for denominational schools and limited provision of state schools. As chairman of a royal commission established in 1866, Higinbotham became convinced that the state must take full responsibility for education and withdraw aid to denominational schools, but Anglican and Roman Catholic opposition temporarily frustrated his efforts to establish a comprehensive system of state schools teaching &#145;common Christianity&#146; but not sectarian doctrine. Believing that it had compromised the principles he had championed, Higinbotham resigned from the ministry in 1869 and lost his seat in parliament in 1871, though the following year it passed the act for secular education that he had advocated. He was re-elected in 1874, but in January 1876, finding himself unable to support Sir Graham Berry's ministry, which was engaged in a struggle with the legislative council on the questions of land tax and payment of members, he resigned his seat; he sympathized with the spirit which animated Berry, but disapproved his methods as subversive of parliamentary government.<br>
<br>Higinbotham now remained aloof from active politics, and in July 1880 was appointed a puisne judge of the supreme court of Victoria. In September 1886, on the retirement of Sir William Stawell, he became chief justice of the colony. His independence and his peculiar view of the position of a colonial government are shown by his refusal to accept a knighthood and by his intimation to the imperial government that if he were appointed to administer the government during the absence of the governor he would cease to refer any matters of local concern to the secretary of state. His minority judgment in the case <i>Toy v. Musgrove</i> in 1888, that the Victorian government had the right to restrict a Chinese immigrant from the British colony of Hong Kong, pressed claims for colonial sovereignty to new limits, and came to be regarded as a landmark of Australian constitutional history.<br>
<br>Higinbotham refused to accept the notion that a person who entered &#145;the kingdom of judicial heaven is bound to become a political eunuch&#146;  (<span class="roman">Victorian parliamentary debates</span>, 19 May 1869). His address on <span class="italic">Science and Religion</span> (1883), at a time of keen religious controversy, struck an anti-clerical note while it insisted on the need to &#145;think with fearless freedom and yet believe&#146;. He was an early advocate of women's franchise. During 1890 he created much indignation by subscribing to the funds of the strikers in that year's great strike. He died of heart failure at his residence in Murphy Street, South Yarra, Melbourne, on 31 December 1892, and was buried privately in the Brighton cemetery on 1 January 1893.<br>
<br>The violence of Higinbotham's political utterances contrasted strangely with the charm and amiability of his private life; those who condemned his political views were strongly attached to him personally. His oratorical power was of a high order, and his intellectual attainments placed him in the forefront of his contemporaries in Victoria. He was independent and radical in his political views, a substantial charitable benefactor, broad-minded, and unconventional in private life. He was small in stature but strong and athletic. He left two sons and three daughters, including Edith, the wife of Professor Edward Ellis Morris, his first biographer.<br>
