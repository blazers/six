<span class="headword">Meidel,  Christopher</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1659, <em>d.</em> in or before 1715), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and translator</span>, was born probably in Skien, Norway, one of three or more children of Gert Meidel (<i>c</i>.1606&#150;1696), a shipowner of Langesund, and his wife, Elen, whose surname was probably Winge. He was educated at the University of Roskilde and may have come to England about 1683 as chaplain to Prince George of Denmark. In 1687 he was appointed minister of the Danish congregation in Wellclose Square, Ratcliffe, London, but he was soon troubled in his conscience by the fact that he &#145;administered the sacrament to persons who were no way bettered thereby&#146;, and consequently, about 1690, he relinquished the charge. About 1696 he began preaching to an Independent congregation in Nightingale Lane, East Smithfield, but after holding the post for a few years his doubts were confirmed and eventually he joined the Quakers. At the time he was living at Stratford in Essex, and supported his family by manual labour.<br>
<br>With the approval of Friends Meidel travelled to Norway in 1700 to visit his brother and other relatives. He ran into difficulties and was arrested in Skien. English Friends intervened and Prince George of Denmark persuaded the Danish ambassador to write to the king of Denmark, thus securing his release. On 24 February 1701 Meidel took part in a notable dispute at Green's Coffee House, Finch Lane, in the City, between Benjamin Keach, a Baptist, and the Quaker minister Richard Claridge. In November of the same year he accompanied Claridge on a series of visits to meetings in Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. In September 1705 he and Claridge attended the burial of a Quaker, by direction of her son at Barking churchyard, and protested that she, being unbaptized, or excommunicate, had no need of ceremonies. Meidel addressed a large crowd over her grave but the vicar's son thrust him out of the churchyard. In the same year, 1705, Meidel issued <span class="italic">An address to my neighbours and others in and about Stratford, near Bow, Essex, assembled to dance on the 1st of the 3rd month, called Mayday</span>.<br>
<br>Meidel was soon afterwards imprisoned. On 4 July 1706 he wrote, from Chelmsford gaol, <span class="italic">An Address to the Danish and Norwegian Lutheran Church in London</span>, which was printed in a Danish translation by himself in his Danish edition of William Dell's <span class="italic">Treatise on Baptism</span> (1706); an English version later appeared in <span class="italic">The Irish Friend</span>  (2/5 1837, 36). Meidel's address gives his reasons for joining the society and takes affectionate leave of his former congregation. He was imprisoned again, in 1707, in Truro and in Launceston, after disturbing the Anglican incumbent of Liskeard's services and for preaching in the streets. He was responsible for the Danish version of William Penn's <span class="italic">Key Opening the Way &hellip; to Discern the Difference</span> (1705) as well as the Danish translations of Robert Barclay's <span class="italic">Apology for the True Christian Divinity</span>, a major undertaking published posthumously in 1738, and Barclay's <span class="italic">Catechism and Confession of Faith</span> (1717).<br>
<br>Meidel also travelled on the continent. In 1704 he attended the yearly meeting of Friends in Amsterdam, and in 1705 made another journey to visit Friends in the Netherlands. As a Quaker minister, in 1708 he visited Friedrickstadt and other towns in Holstein, where the Friends were suffering persecution. Travelling through France he was arrested, detained at Pont and at St Lys, and finally taken to Paris. There he was brought through the streets, chained to other prisoners, and preached repentance to the people standing by, who freely offered him money which he refused. On 22 August 1708 he wrote to William Sewel from the Grand Ch&acirc;telet, asking for money to be sent. Meidel appears to have died, presumably in Europe, by 1715, when his brother Gerhard acted on behalf of his son, who was in London, in the matter of a family inheritance. Nothing further is known of his wife and family.<br>
