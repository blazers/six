<span class="headword">Leslie, Sir  Harald Robert</span>, Lord Birsay  (1905&#150;1982), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 8 May 1905 at South Shields, co. Durham, the only son of Robert Leslie, master mariner, and his wife, Margaret Mowat Cochrane. His parents were both natives of Stromness, Orkney, and although he spent most of his life in southern Scotland, Leslie considered himself an Orcadian. His father died of a heart condition while serving in the merchant navy during the First World War, and Leslie professed that his only ambition had been to go to sea, but he was dissuaded from doing so by his widowed mother. His early childhood was spent in the borders, where he attended Berwickshire high school, Duns. He later moved to Glasgow and was educated at Glasgow high school and at Glasgow University, where he took MA (1927) and LLB (1930) degrees. He became a solicitor in 1930 and practised in Glasgow, but he found the life uncongenial and studied briefly for the ministry of the Church of Scotland. In 1937 he was called to the Scottish bar. He had been active in the Officers' Training Corps, and in 1939 he volunteered for active service. When his posting was delayed he briefly served as a stoker on a small steamer running military supplies around Scapa Flow. He was later commissioned into the Royal Scots and served throughout the war. He was mentioned in dispatches and appointed a military MBE; in 1945 he transferred to the reserve with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In the same year he returned to practice at the bar, and on 27 December married Robina Margaret Marwick, the daughter of James George Marwick, a provost of Stromness. She had served as a doctor with the British forces in Germany and was among the first allied medical personnel to enter Belsen concentration camp. They set up home in Edinburgh and adopted a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Between 1947 and 1951 Leslie served as an advocate depute under the Labour administration, acting as a prosecutor in the High Court of Justiciary. Despite having few connections in the law, his promotion was rapid and he took silk in 1949. At the bar his outstanding talent was as a jury pleader at a time when civil jury trials in actions for damages for personal injuries took up much of the business of the Court of Session. He was at his best when representing the pursuer, and was frequently successful. Later he defended the mass murderer Peter Manuel until his client, who was subsequently found guilty and hanged, dismissed him and took over his own defence. Although Leslie was not considered to be in the front rank as a lawyer, his powerful presence, coupled with his oratorical gifts and a stalwart independence, placed him among the most prominent advocates of the day. He was able to deploy to great advantage a rich bass voice which he enhanced with a pleasingly modified Orkney intonation.<br>
<br>While Leslie was admired by many of his brother advocates, in the narrow world of Parliament House the admiration was not universal. His determinedly homely delivery, his readiness to appeal to the emotions of juries (and even of judges), and his lack of enthusiasm for minute legal analysis did not endear him to elements of the legal establishment, and in particular to Lord Clyde, the lord president, whom he warmly disliked, and with whom he had several bitter courtroom confrontations. Nevertheless, in 1956 he was made sheriff of Roxburgh, Berwick, and Selkirk, when such appointments were seen as the route to elevation to the Supreme Court bench.<br>
<br>In 1959 Leslie stood for election as dean of the Faculty of Advocates (the leader of the Scottish bar), and in the first ballot his popularity enabled him to defeat the powerful establishment candidate I. H. Shearer QC. He was ultimately defeated by the compromise candidate, W. I. R. Fraser QC (later Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, lord of appeal). In 1961 he was translated to the (part-time) sheriffdom of Caithness, Sutherland, Orkney, and Zetland, an appointment which gave him considerable personal satisfaction. In 1965 he was appointed chairman of the Scottish land court, with the rank and tenure of a judge of the Court of Session, and took the title Lord Birsay from a village in Orkney. The land court had been set up in 1912 to adjudicate on disputes between crofting tenants and their landlords following upon the granting of security of tenure in the wake of the suffering caused by the highland clearances. Later it assumed a wider jurisdiction under the <span class="roman">Agricultural Holdings Acts</span>. While the court's headquarters were in Edinburgh, its jurisdiction was peripatetic and Leslie regularly sat in remote parts of Scotland, often in village halls and other even less formal surroundings. His genuine interest in the people and their culture, his approachability and his pragmatism fitted him well for this work and his public popularity and reputation increased.<br>
<br>It was in the wider field of public affairs that Leslie made his greatest mark on Scottish life. In the general election of 1950 he stood as Labour candidate in the Orkney and Shetland constituency, but was defeated by Jo Grimond, who subsequently held the seat for many years for the Liberals. Leslie appeared incapable of refusing any request for help or service in the charitable or public sphere, and accepted a vast range of appointments. Among them were the chairmanships of the Scottish Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders, the Committee on General Medical Services in the Highlands and Islands, the National Savings Committee for Scotland, and the Scottish Advisory Committee on the Travelling People. He was also a vice-president of the Boys' Brigade, trustee of the Scottish Architectural Heritage Trust, and president of the Scottish national dictionary. In that capacity he led an appeal for a concise Scots dictionary which, when it was ultimately published after his death, was dedicated to his memory. He was an elder of the Church of Scotland for nearly fifty years and sat on many committees of the general assembly. The culmination of his life of public service was his appointment as lord high commissioner to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1965 and 1966.<br>
<br>Leslie was in constant demand as a speaker and rarely declined an invitation. He would travel considerable distances at his own expense to address modest local gatherings as readily as he would undertake important after-dinner speeches. His reputation preceded him and his audiences were readily captivated by his homely eloquence, although even his admirers conceded that the content sometimes took second place to the charm of his delivery. Throughout his public life his natural warmth and generosity won him much affection across a wide range of Scottish society. He was appointed CBE in 1963. In 1966 he received LLD degrees from Glasgow and Strathclyde universities and in the same year was made an honorary fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland in recognition of his services to education. In 1973 he was made a knight of the Order of the Thistle. He died of a coronary thrombosis on 27 November 1982 at his home, 27 Queensferry Road, Edinburgh. His wife survived him.<br>
