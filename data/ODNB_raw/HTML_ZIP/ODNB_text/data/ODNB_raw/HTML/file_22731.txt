<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Preston,  Thomas</span>, first Viscount Tara  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1585, <em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the second son of Christopher Preston, fourth Viscount Gormanstown (1536/7&#150;1600), and his second wife, Catherine Fitzwilliam (<i>d</i>. 1602?), daughter of Sir Thomas Fitzwilliam of Baggotsrath, co. Dublin. Preston may have been the brother of the fifth viscount who was reported in December 1600 as receiving his education at the Irish house at Douai (Douai College) alongside other sons of Old English families.<h2>
<a name="Spanishservice"></a>Spanish service</h2>As a younger son of a Catholic family, albeit the leading family of the pale, Preston chose military service abroad because it was one of the relatively few careers open to him. In 1605 he recruited a company in Ireland and proceeded to the Spanish Netherlands (later the Southern Netherlands) where he was commissioned in Henry O'Neill's regiment. In 1608 he was pitched into a controversy between Old English captains and their colonel, the son of Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone. The rift over questions of allegiance and to the crown arose &#145;from a speech of Preston's upon Henry's discourse tending to make war and raise troubles within this kingdom [Ireland]; to which he answered, it was not lawful, neither would he ever bear arms against his sovereign&#146;  (Henry, <span class="italic">The Irish Military Community</span>, 142). Also in 1608 Preston served at the siege of Rheinberg on the German frontier. The regiment was scattered in garrison duties throughout most of the period of the truce with the Dutch (1609&#150;21) apart from Spinola's Palatinate campaign of 1620.<br>
<br>Preston married a daughter of Charles vander Eycken, from one of the most powerful and wealthy families in Brabant, shortly after 1612. They had two sons and a daughter; the sons&#151;Anthony and James, or Diego&#151;were to play an active part in the confederate armies and both fought at the battle of Rathconnell, co. Westmeath, in 1643. Their mother died on 28 October 1621, and Preston married Marguerite de Namur, a widow, about 1623. Though certainly alive two years before Preston's death, she was to predecease him. They had five daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Preston fought with O'Neill's regiment in the initial stages of the siege of Breda (1624&#150;5). By March 1625, three months before the end of the siege, he had left the regiment and recruited a company of Irish cuirassiers. Preston's departure from the Irish regiment probably resulted from tensions with Owen Roe O'Neill, the acting regimental commander. These tensions arose from the outbreak of hostilities between Spain and England in 1625 when English officials tried to persuade Preston and other Old English officers of the Irish regiment to leave the Spanish service. However, the company was disbanded in September 1625, just six months after its inception. Preston was subsequently maintained as an <i>entretenido</i>. This status commonly referred to an officer without a command receiving an additional allowance while serving, in effect, as a rank and file soldier. In May 1629 Stadholder Frederick Henry besieged 's-Hertogenbosch, one of the four principal cities of Brabant. Preston served with the Spanish relief force which initially approached the besiegers but then swung eastwards to link up with imperial forces. The joint force then crossed the Ysel to launch a diversionary raid on the more vulnerable eastern flank of the United Provinces. The expedition overran the Veluwe in Gelderland and captured Amersfoort in Utrecht, thereby penetrating to the heart of the United Provinces. However, Frederick Henry was not to be distracted and 's-Hertogenbosch fell in September.<br>
<br>The Anglo-Spanish <i>rapprochement</i> of 1629&#150;30 reopened the possibility of large scale recruiting in Ireland and, in January 1632, Preston was promoted major in a new regiment, Tyrconnel's, with instructions to recruit in Ireland. His encouragement to would-be captains to raise companies from the new regiment was the subject of complaints by the lords justices in Ireland who were, apparently, not supportive of the new pro-Spanish foreign policy. However, the arrival of Lord Deputy Wentworth smoothed Preston's path. Wentworth's partiality is evident from his praise of Preston as &#145;a faithful friend&#146; and &#145;one of the civilest gentlemen of his nation&#146;  (Jennings, 574). In August 1634 Preston was commissioned to form another regiment on his own behalf comprising fifteen companies, each of 200 men. In the event he recruited 2400 men and was back in the Southern Netherlands by April 1635 in time for the long-threatened hostilities with France. The French invaded with an enormous field army of some 26,000 soldiers, their advance being in tandem with Dutch attacks in the north. Preston's regiment played a crucial part in repulsing the French incursion as one of four regiments which held Louvain for eleven days against vastly superior enemy forces. Preston was in charge of two of the city gates against which the French directed their attack and his regiment lost seventy men in counter-attacks. This was the start of a period of heavy attrition for the 7000 or more soldiers in the four Irish <i>tercios</i>. The following year, 1636, saw the Cardinal Infante invade northern France and capture Corbie before being forced to withdraw. Preston's regiment probably took part in the invasion; at any rate in November 1636 it was disbanded because it was significantly under-strength and the individual soldiers were transferred to top up Tyrconnel's regiment. Once again Preston was an officer without a field command. In 1641 he was governor of Gennepp, a small city on the eastern borders of the United Provinces. He beat off a storming party after the walls were breached before surrendering in July &#145;upon honourable terms with no little glory to himself&#146;  (Carte, 1.367).<h2>
<a name="TheIrishrising"></a>The Irish rising</h2>Following the Irish rising of 1641 Preston and Owen Roe O'Neill were chosen to reinforce the insurgents with professional leadership and munitions. In December 1642 Preston was formally commissioned as general of the Leinster provincial army of the Catholic confederates. Preston doubtless owed his appointment partly to the fact that his nephew Nicholas, sixth Viscount Gormanstown, was then the political leader of the Leinster confederates. At any rate he was not picked entirely for his military qualities to judge from the character sketch penned by Hugh de Burgo, the Franciscan mainly responsible for organizing the expedition from the Southern Netherlands. Writing to Luke Wadding at Rome he described Preston as &#145;very brave, but not a man of much prudence; true it is that he is more popular than the other [O'Neill], but there is absolutely no comparison between the two talents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Franciscan MSS</span>, 145). Traditionally Preston has suffered in comparisons between the two contemporaries and rivals. However, he has not been sufficiently credited for his skill in siege warfare. Admittedly he started inauspiciously after his landing in mid-September when he failed to prevent a relief force from resupplying Ballinakill, a strong protestant garrison a mere 8 miles from the confederate Catholic capital of Kilkenny. After building up his forces he captured Borris, Birr, and Fort Falkland near Banagher, between 30 December 1642 and 27 January 1643, thereby opening a direct route from Kilkenny towards Connaught.<br>
<br>In March 1643 Ormond, the king's representative, marched from Dublin to capture New Ross in order to cut off Kilkenny, and confederate Ireland, from its major ports of Wexford and Waterford. Ormond failed to take New Ross and Preston tried to block his retreat northwards at Ballinvegga. Preston's handling of the battle of Ballinvegga, or Ross, could be faulted in that he deployed his cavalry to attack along a narrow <i>boreen</i> lined with hedgerows and covered by enemy artillery. The results were predictably demoralizing. Critics who blamed Preston for not choosing a better blocking position further to the north-west ignored the fact that, had he done so Ormond would have been able to veer north-eastwards and retrace his original line of march. Preston's fault was not in his choice of terrain but his handling of the cavalry. Nor can he be especially blamed for the poor performance of the infantry, who were overwhelmingly poorly trained local militia. Preston redeemed himself by finally capturing Ballinakill in May with the aid of a newly acquired 24-pounder siege gun. He next mobilized a core of 2000 regulars and, supplemented by local militia, spent the early summer trying to eliminate the dense pocket of protestant garrisons&#151;Edenderry, Castlejordan, Portlester, and Athboy&#151;blocking the route from the west, through the midland bogs, towards Dublin. In mid-August, however, he was obliged to disband his army &#145;for want of means&#146;  (Gilbert, 1.48).<br>
<br>The cessation of September 1643 with Ormond left, for the moment, no enemy forces in Leinster. Not until the garrison of Duncannon rejected the cessation and allied themselves with the parliamentarians in Munster did Preston see action again. His siege (20 January &#150; 19 March 1645) of this promontory fort, dominating the approaches to Waterford and New Ross, showed Preston at his best. Duncannon was exceptionally well-fortified yet, despite the rigours of a mid-winter siege, Preston lost remarkably few men through sickness and sustained only 67 killed in action from an army of some 1300 soldiers. The capture involved the innovative use of parallel trenches connecting the saps (the first known parallels were dug by the French at the siege of Gravelines in 1644), plunging mortar fire, direct fire to deter enemy shipping, undermining, and a final assault by the infantry. Later in the campaigning season he was sent by the supreme council to Youghal to assist the earl of Castlehaven in capturing the town. Castlehaven saw Preston's arrival as an implied slight on his conduct of the siege and, moving camp away from the town, he declined to co-operate. Preston eventually abandoned the siege after an assault on the town was beaten back.<br>
<br>The following summer Preston again campaigned outside Leinster. While half his army (by now expanded to 6000 regular infantry and 600 cavalry) was sent to besiege Bunratty in co. Clare he himself led the remainder into Connaught. The object of this campaign was to eliminate the protestant-held garrisons in co. Roscommon which had rejected the cessation. He was then to recapture Sligo, lost the previous year. Preston carried out his initial objectives and beat off a force which tried to relieve Roscommon Castle. However, he declined to move north from Boyle and cross the Curlew Mountains, pleading that the countryside towards Sligo was stripped bare of provisions.<h2>
<a name="BetweenRinucciniandOrmond"></a>Between Rinuccini and Ormond</h2>Meanwhile, the &#145;Ormond peace&#146; was proclaimed at Kilkenny and Dublin (30 July &#150; 3 August 1646). This treaty referred the repeal of the penal laws against Catholics &#145;to his Majestie's gracious favour&#146;, while the confederates agreed to dissolve their government before the actual granting of such concessions. It was, in short, &#145;a poor return on almost four years of war&#146;  (M. &Oacute; Siochru, <span class="italic">Confederate Ireland, 1642&#150;1649: a Constitutional and Political Analysis</span>, 1999, 111). Rinuccini, the papal nuncio, rejected the terms on the grounds that they were unfavourable to Catholic interests and threatened to excommunicate all who accepted them. The Leinster army occupied a pivotal role between a clericalist Ulster army and an Ormondist Munster army and Preston was persuaded by the nuncio to join with Owen Roe O'Neill and capture Dublin from Ormond. The importance of their mutual distrust has been exaggerated; at any rate it was not the sole reason why the operation failed. The Dublin hinterland had been stripped of foodstuffs by Ormond, bridges and mills destroyed, while heavy rains had reduced supplies from further afield to a trickle. In the circumstances, campaigning with the largest force ever mustered by the confederation (at least 20,000 soldiers and camp followers) posed insurmountable logistical difficulties. Preston's unauthorized agreement with the earl of Clanricarde, Ormond's intermediary, convinced O'Neill that Preston was plotting against him and a false report that parliamentarian troops had reinforced Dublin precipitated O'Neill's retreat from his camp at Leixlip. In late November Preston withdrew from his camp at Lucan to Naas, complaining that O'Neill's retreat had left him dangerously exposed. He continued to intrigue with Ormond, with the intention, perhaps, of launching a joint attack on the clericalists or sailing with most of his army for France. On the face of it, it seems improbable that he would have sided with France against Spain given his previous service. However, Sir Kenelm Digby later claimed that Preston had secured the agreement of most of the Leinster army while Ormond obtained permission from the parliament to embark the soldiers for France. Moreover Preston's son James, having recently recruited a regiment for the Spanish service, apparently connived at the interception of the troopships and the transfer of the regiment to the French service.<br>
<br>To forestall more intrigues Rinuccini formally threatened Preston and his army with excommunication if the army did not disperse to its assigned winter quarters. Preston complied on 10 December, though even then he allegedly wrote to Ormond urging him to attack the Ulster army. Ormond evidently did not trust Preston because he was &#145;too much of a bigot in the point of religion and so wavering in his mind, so changeable in his resolutions&#146;  (Carte, 1.589). At any rate Clanricarde's agreement had served its main purpose: &#145;&hellip; it had saved Dublin and divided the confederates&#146;  (ibid., 593). Ormond's army subsequently foraged in the confederate quarters of Westmeath and Cavan, thereby provoking a definitive breakdown in negotiations. Ormond himself handed over Dublin to the parliamentarians and left Ireland shortly afterwards, his army passing to the command of the new commander, Michael Jones. Preston's orders for the campaigning season of 1647 were to constrict Jones to Dublin, and to starve him out by burning the corn and driving off cattle. By late July Preston was encamped near Naas when Jones, with a much smaller army, attacked the camp. After some cannon shot the attackers retreated in some disorder. Preston hesitated about unleashing the cavalry to follow up this success, thereby giving Jones time to escape, conduct which Bellings criticized as &#145;supine remissness&#146;. By the end of the month Preston had captured Maynooth, co. Kildare, and other outlying garrisons and was besieging Trim, co. Meath. Jones again marched from Dublin but this time hugged the coast until he joined with British forces from Ulster and the Drogheda garrison. With an army almost equal in size to Preston's he then marched to relieve Trim.<h2>
<a name="DungansHill"></a>Dungan's Hill</h2>&#145;General Preston was much blamed for his conduct in losing that army, for had he stayed within Portlester-pass, as Mac Art [O'Neill] sent him advice &hellip; but he did not but thought to do the work himself but his fate was otherwise&#146;  (Hogan, 62). The &#145;British Officer's&#146; criticisms go to the heart of the matter; Preston could have avoided battle. He was faced with an army which now enjoyed numerical parity, if only for the ten days Jones could afford to pay his auxiliaries. Moreover, Jones had the edge in the decisive cavalry arm, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Preston knew all this and could have remained within the impregnable bog-girt confines of Portlester. Instead he tried to steal a march on Jones by making a forced march on Dublin which was thinly garrisoned by a former royalist regiment of apparently doubtful loyalty. He stole away, leaving his tents and colours standing to deceive the enemy and marched some 12 miles to the south-east that day. This was not sufficient to outpace Jones and the following morning, 8 August 1647, he was overtaken. He deployed his forces on Dungan's Hill (about half-way between Trim and Maynooth) to receive the enemy.<br>
<br>The commentator who exulted that Dungan's Hill was &#145;the greatest victory and most signal victory the English ever had in Ireland&#146;  (Borlase, 242) was hardly exaggerating. At least 3000 of the Leinster infantry were slain (out of about 5000 on the battlefield), mainly after the battle, as against the loss of a mere forty, or so, of their enemies. The scale of the slaughter together with the loss of transport, munitions, and arms destroyed what was, arguably, the best organized and equipped of the confederate armies. Defeat, if not annihilation, was predictable given Preston's relative weakness in cavalry. He compounded this by, as at Ross, deploying his best cavalry troops in a narrow lane where their mobility was fatally constricted.<br>
<br>The long-term effects of the battle may be grasped from the fact that, a year later, Preston's own regiment consisted of a mere 200 soldiers and the Leinster army contained only four under-strength infantry regiments. In 1648, following a truce with Inchiquin, the internal power struggle erupted into open warfare between the clericalists and Ormondists. Preston played a role commensurate with the depleted size of his army, capturing minor garrisons of O'Neill in co. Kildare. When Ormond returned to Ireland to assume command of the new pan-royalist alliance Preston wrote (12 October) pointing out his services in keeping the Leinster army together for the king. In return Ormond, on 28 December 1648, promised him a peerage and a commensurate estate from lands to be forfeited from those opposing the king.<h2>
<a name="Royalistcommander"></a>Royalist commander</h2>Preston was not given command of a field army, however, and did not play a prominent part in the fighting after Cromwell landed in August 1649. In the spring of 1650 he was appointed governor of Waterford, which had held out against Cromwell the previous December. Increasingly the city was isolated as the royalists were pushed back towards the north and west. The isolation was complete after Hugh <i>dubh</i> O'Neill abandoned Clonmel for want of ammunition in May 1650. Apart from his failure to resupply O'Neill, Preston's conduct of the defence cannot be faulted. When Ireton approached the city in June and offered terms Preston replied spiritedly that he had never been asked to surrender a city without a siege, nor had conditions ever been offered to him before he asked for them. He surrendered on good terms in August only on the advice of Ormond and at the insistence of the citizenry, by now suffering from famine and bubonic plague.<br>
<br>During the siege Preston was created Viscount Tara and his next important appointment was as governor of Galway, the last city in Irish hands. Ireton, writing from Clare Castle in November 1651, demanded the surrender of the city and, if this were not forthcoming, threatened &#145;you may guess whose head shall pay for the trouble and mischief that shall follow&#146;  (Hardiman, 134). Preston dismissed Ireton's threats and added that &#145;such as hazard men's lives without a just cause will one day answer for their blood before God, the just judge, in which (when you reflect on your own actions) you will find yourself as guilty as others&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>This acrimonious correspondence was cut short by Ireton's death from the plague. The following month Charles Coote set about shutting off the landward approaches to Galway but made no attempt to storm the city defences, which had recently been strengthened with the addition of an outer curtain and bastions. Preston conducted an active defence, most notably in surprising and wiping out the parliamentarian detachment on Mutton Island. However, his attempts to run the naval blockade failed and civilian morale crumbled with the prospect of famine. The town surrendered on 5 April 1652 on terms as good as those originally offered by Ireton.<br>
<br>Subsequently Preston was allowed by parliament to embark 4000 or 5000 soldiers for the Spanish service. However, by the autumn of 1653 he had moved to Paris where his offer to serve the exiled Charles II was declined. He then offered his services to the French, apparently to encourage Irish deserters from the Spanish. He died in Paris in October 1655, and was buried there on 21 October.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Preston's skill in siege warfare was especially useful to the confederates in the early years of their war effort. He was, however, an incompetent battlefield commander. Preston's shortcomings may be attributed to inexperience of cavalry warfare and, more especially, of large-scale command. For most of his career, other than an eighteen-month period (1635&#150;6) as regimental commander, he commanded nothing larger than an infantry company. Nor was he deft at political intrigue. He was &#145;very cholerick &hellip; and broke out, even in Councils of War, into rash expressions, of which he had frequently cause to repent&#146;  (Carte, 1.589). Moreover his vacillations between Rinuccini and Ormond were the result of genuine doubts about the religious concessions. Had he thrown his weight unreservedly behind either faction the power struggle might have had a decisive outcome. A definitive victory by either party would have been preferable to the perpetuation of debilitating factionalism. In particular a quick assault on Dublin in 1646 by the combined forces of the Ulster and Leinster armies might very well have taken Dublin from Ormond before he handed the city over to the parliamentarians. In large measure because of Preston's dithering the siege was protracted to the point that the armies used up available supplies and had to retreat. Had the confederates taken Dublin they would have denied Cromwell a convenient beachhead for his landing in 1649. Preston's ill-advised attempt to surprise Dublin the following year led to the destruction of his army at Dungan's Hill. This disaster, and the confederate defeat at Knocknanuss in Munster later in 1647, ultimately brought about the collapse of the Catholic confederates. For all his undoubted skill and courage in siege warfare, both in the Southern Netherlands and Ireland, Preston's record in Ireland is mainly characterized by political and military ineptitude.<br>
