<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Stephen</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1502, <em>d.</em> 1549), <span class="occ">merchant and administrator</span>, was born into the London branch of the Vaughan family, which was of Welsh descent and had joined the ranks of the London mercantile community in the fifteenth century. His father is thought to have been an undistinguished London mercer, who was still alive in 1535 and probably educated his son at St Paul's School. Stephen Vaughan spoke in later life as though he knew John Colet.<br>
<br>Vaughan followed in his father's footsteps, embarking on a commercial career. He was an active member of the Merchant Adventurers. Each year his business caused him to pursue a hectic peripatetic course between the Low Country marts, about which he recorded:<blockquote>after the exigencies of the same, so that I am never at rest. I am now at Barrugh [Bergen op Zoom], now at Bruce [Bruges], now at Gamut [Ghent], now here now there, so that not without exceeding trouble can I satisfy to all those to whom I minister &hellip; as to please all if it were possible. (BL, Cotton MS Galba B.x, fol. 9<i>r</i>)</blockquote>Unfortunately, such sources relating to his commercial activities only describe his later years as a merchant. He was held in high regard by the mercantile community and received a pension from the Merchant Adventurers from 1529. On the death of Sir John Hackett in October 1534 he acted as chief factor for the English merchants operating at Antwerp, residing at the English House. Finally, on the death of John Hutton on 5 September 1538, Vaughan was chosen to succeed him both as governor of the company and as Henry VIII's ambassador in the Low Countries. The years 1538 to 1539 marked a high point, not only in his career as a mercer and merchant adventurer but also in his developing role as a diplomat in the service of Sir Thomas Cromwell, principal secretary, and the crown.<h2>
<a name="ServanttoCromwellandtothecrownc15201539"></a>Servant to Cromwell and to the crown, c.1520&#150;1539</h2>As early as March 1524 Vaughan was in Cromwell's service and rose with his master. During the 1520s the two men developed a strong, enduring, and mutually supportive relationship. Vaughan enjoyed the hospitality of his master and the wide acquaintanceship that it afforded. It was through Cromwell's influence, for instance, that he was employed by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, archbishop of York, to &#145;write the evidence&#146; for his college at Oxford  (Richardson, 18). In return Vaughan assisted Cromwell in business negotiations and, as a personal spy during his frequent trips to the Low Countries, he kept him informed of rumours and significant political trends there. Nor was this a fair-weather friendship.<br>
<br>With Cromwell's initial disgrace, following the fall of Wolsey in 1529, he found in Vaughan a true and loyal friend. His letters to his master at this fateful time are worth quoting in full. Writing on 30 October he declared:<blockquote>I commend me unto you and am greatly in doubt how you are entreated in this sudden overthrow of my lord your master [Wolsey]. I never longed for to hear from you as now, and like as a true heart is never overthrown with no tempest, like so cannot the same in your trouble, but be now much more thrifty to know your state, and more greedy to show you, if it were possible, by works how much it counteth to serve you. Wherefore, if there be any service in the world which I may do for you, let me have knowledge and be assured of me as of yourself &hellip; Though I hear many things of you which please me no, yet do I doubt but your truth and wisdom shall deliver you from danger. You are more hated for your master's sake than for anything which I think you have wrongfully done any man. (TNA: PRO, SP 1/55, fol. 246<i>r</i>)</blockquote>Vaughan wrote on 3 February 1530 from Bergen op Zoom, immediately following Cromwell's restoration to favour, telling him how relieved he was to learn that his master had weathered the storm successfully. &#145;You now sail in a sure haven&#146;, he observed, but hastened to warn him against further complications, &#145;a merry semblance of weather often trusteth men into dangerous seas, not thinking to be suddenly oppressed with tempest, when unawares they be prevented and brought in great jeopardy&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/56, fol. 252<i>r</i>). Such steadfast and unstinting support was given, moreover, at a time when he was beset with his own problems. No longer able to depend on Cromwell's protection he fell prey to internecine struggles of a religious nature, which in 1529 wrought havoc within the ranks of the Merchant Adventurers. He was cited to appear before Cuthbert Tunstall, bishop of London, on charges of heresy at the instigation of Hutton, the then governor of the company, charges from which he only finally freed himself in 1531.<br>
<br>With Cromwell's return to Henry's favour in 1530, the heat went out of this affair and Vaughan was once again able to pursue his career based as it was on his intimate association with his master and friend. Throughout the years 1530 to 1539 life was hectic for Vaughan as he combined the roles of diplomat and merchant. November 1530 again saw him in the Low Countries. Cromwell dispatched him to find William Tyndale, in order to urge him to return to England, a task that not only absorbed much of Vaughan's time during the years 1530 and 1531 but also ultimately proved completely fruitless. Neither his lack of success nor the king's resultant displeasure seems to have set back his career as a diplomat. Another four major missions followed between 1532 and 1539, during which time he never gave up his mercantile activities. In December 1532 he was sent to France to report on the political situation, returning to Calais by the end of July 1533. Almost immediately thereafter, on 28 July, he left that city to join Christopher Mont at Antwerp, from where the two men set out to undertake negotiations with the German princes, a mission that finished only in December. Then after a year's respite, during which he became chief factor for the English merchants operating at Antwerp, he was again employed in 1535, in the role of confidential messenger, on a secret mission to Denmark. Returning to England in January 1536 he was sent by the king to observe an interview between Eustache Chapuys and Katherine of Aragon, which took place just before &#145;the Dowager's&#146; death. His role on this occasion, as the imperial ambassador made clear to Charles V, was to &#145;spy on my movements and report what I might say or do during my visit&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1536&#150;8</i>, no. 3). Vaughan married Margery (<i>d</i>. 1544), whose brother John Gwyneth was his executor. They had a son, Stephen (<i>b</i>. 1536/7), and two daughters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69054/', "Anne Locke (c.1530&#150;1590x1607)")</script> and Jane. Finally, in the autumn of 1538 he accompanied Thomas Wriothesley, clerk of the signet, on an embassy to the Low Countries to establish closer amity and to confer with the regent, Mary of Hungary, regarding Henry's proposed marriage with Christina, dowager duchess of Milan. When these negotiations broke down Wriothesley returned home in March 1539. Vaughan remained in Brussels as resident ambassador and governor of the Merchant Adventurers. It was in this capacity that he entertained Anne of Cleves on her passage to England in December 1539, accompanying her to London, where they arrived at Christmas. He returned to Brussels in January 1540.<br>
<br>The 1530s saw Vaughan rise rapidly in the service of the crown, yet the rewards for his devoted service were limited in comparison with leading courtiers. In July 1531 he was appointed writer of the king's books, which carried an annual salary of &pound;20. In 1533, as a reward for his work in Germany, he was granted an annuity of &pound;20 and in 1534 he was appointed as clerk of dispensations and faculties in chancery, a post that he held <i>in absentia</i>. Nor did he fare as well as he might have expected from Cromwell, who obtained for him the priory of St Mary Spital, in Shoreditch, London, and secured for his wife her appointment as silk-woman to Anne Boleyn. At least until 1544 he still relied on his earnings as a merchant.<h2>
<a name="Royalagent15391546"></a>Royal agent, 1539&#150;1546</h2>From 1539 to 1544 Vaughan's work for the crown in the Low Countries was mainly of a commercial character. Following his return to Brussels in January 1540 he became embroiled in the economic turmoil of the summer and autumn before returning to Flanders in 1541 to assist Sir Edward Carne in securing the repeal of imperial legislation impeding English commerce. With the long-awaited outbreak of war between Valois and Habsburg in July 1542, Vaughan's service to the crown centred on the recruitment of mercenaries and raising loans on the Antwerp bourse. In March 1544 he was appointed commissary in the Low Countries and Germany and was dispatched with Thomas Chamberlain to recruit mercenaries to operate with the English army. This task was vitally important because Henry needed more professional soldiers. For three months Vaughan and Chamberlain pursued a hazardous course. Vaughan's life was on more than one occasion threatened, before he was able to bring this motley array of recruits (or at least some of them) to join the king's army at Calais.<br>
<br>Only with this work completed was Vaughan permitted to arrange his oft-requested passage to London to be at the bedside of his ailing wife&#151;and even then he arrived too late. She had died on 16 September, ten days before his arrival. Nor did an uncaring privy council leave him long to grieve. In October he was back in Antwerp and only after the strongest representations was he allowed in early November to make a hurried trip home to put his affairs in order&#151;on the condition that he returned to the continent by 21 October. Most pressing was the task of providing for the care of his children. Vaughan's thoughts thus turned to marrying again but, confined as he was to the Low Countries, this was no easy task. Pleas to find him a wife addressed to the king's secretary, Sir William Paget, and then to Baron Wriothesley, lord chancellor, produced no result. Indeed it was to be another year before in February 1546 he found himself another partner&#151;Margery Brinklow (<i>d</i>. 1557), the impoverished widow of the London mercer Henry Brinklow, who died in 1545/6. Even then, so little could he be spared from his official duties that his new bride had to pass over to Calais, where the couple were married in the private chapel of Sir George Brooke, ninth Lord Cobham, deputy of Calais, on or shortly after 27 April. They had no children.<br>
<br>From the time of his appointment as the crown's chief financial agent in the Low Countries in May 1544 until his resignation from the post on 8 September 1546, whatever his personal problems, Vaughan was rarely absent from Antwerp. Ever since the fateful instruction in May 1544 when, amid a myriad of fund-raising schemes, the king ordered Vaughan to raise a loan on the Antwerp bourse, his stay in that city was virtually uninterrupted. Under his guidance, during the years from 1544 to 1546 Henry's mounting debts were managed with exemplary care. Secure in the support of the privy council, initially Vaughan's primary concern was with gaining some knowledge of the labyrinthine tactics of the denizens of the bourse&#151;the southern German merchant bankers, brokers like Jaspar Ducci, and underwriters. Exploiting Vaughan's ignorance of market operations during his first year as royal factor, these men managed to milk the English crown by creating a major difference between the nominal and real interest rates on loans raised for it. Vaughan, however, was an apt pupil. Before leaving his post he was able to cut through the tangle of financial ploys. He simplified the process for negotiations and established direct links with the Antwerp agents of the southern German merchant bankers, which allowed him to reduce transactions costs and the real interest rate paid by the English crown. By the accession of Edward VI in 1547, Vaughan had managed to establish a place for the crown on the Antwerp market, which was commensurate with its true credit standing.<br>
<br>Yet once again, in spite of giving up his mercantile activity and devoting himself wholeheartedly to the exigencies of royal service, he was not as well rewarded as he might have expected to be. In November 1542 he was the recipient of seven small pieces of property in London. He acquired a better position as under-treasurer at the Tower of London mint on 25 March 1544, which brought with it an annual salary of &pound;133 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. It was to this post and the clerkship of faculties in chancery that he returned after his resignation in September 1546. He lived in London with his new wife until his death there on 25 December 1549. He was buried at St Mary-le-Bow, London. It would be difficult to disagree with W. C. Richardson's view that Vaughan rose from obscurity and despite years of devoted royal service, during which he firmly established English crown finance at Antwerp, died inconspicuously, and was soon forgotten.<br>
