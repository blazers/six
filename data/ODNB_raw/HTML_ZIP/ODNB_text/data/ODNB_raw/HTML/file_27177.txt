<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boydell,  John, engravers</span>  (<em>act. </em>1760&#150;1804), <span class="occ">printmakers</span>, came to prominence in the rapid expansion of the Boydell publishing business in the later 1760s. With his career as a printmaker coming to a close around 1760, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3120/', "John Boydell (1720&#150;1804)")</script> emerged as the most important employer of engravers in late eighteenth-century London. Still listing himself as an importer of prints in the early 1760s, by 1770 he was exporting to the European market, marking the maturation of the British school. The network of engravers whose talents he employed reflects both the patriotic concerns of the publisher, in being dominated by indigenous artists, and the commercial nature of his ventures. Boydell did not raise a school as such, but rather cultivated a variety of talents, calling on these according to the nature of the project in hand. All of Boydell's engravers worked in a variety of genres and for different publishers.<br>
<br>Aside from the high-profile engravers Francesco Bartolozzi (1728&#150;1813) and Lewis Schiavonetti (1765&#150;1810), Boydell employed a number of foreigners, notably the brothers Haid and the brothers Facius, and the French printmaker <a href="#cosubject_65507">Jean Baptiste Michel [<i>see below</i>]</a>. The brothers <a name="cosubject_65503"></a><span class="headword">Johann Gottfried Haid</span>  (1710&#150;1776)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_65502"></a><span class="headword">Johann Elias Haid</span>  (1739&#150;1809)<span class="occ"></span> were members of a distinguished artistic family from Augsburg, the place of their birth. Johann Gottfried was trained by his father, Johann Lorenz Haid, and Johann Elias by his elder brother. They worked almost exclusively for Boydell during a period in London from 1764 to 1767, producing prints after Zoffany, Reynolds, and the old masters. After that date Johann Elias returned to Augsburg, where he died in 1809, while Johann Gottfried went to Vienna to teach at the new Kupferstecher-Academie; he died in that city in 1776. The brothers <a name="cosubject_65506"></a><span class="headword">Johann Gottlieb Facius</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1750, <em>d.</em> in or before 1813)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_65505"></a><span class="headword">Georg Siegmund Facius</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1750, <em>d.</em> in or before 1813)<span class="occ"></span> were both born in Regensburg about 1750. Specialists in stipple-engraving, they studied in Brussels, where their father was Russian consul. They were working exclusively for Boydell in London from 1776, and collaboratively they engraved and stippled for him several plates after William Hamilton and Angelica Kauffmann, James Barry's <span class="italic">Birth of Venus</span> (1778), and reproductions of Sir Joshua Reynolds's stained-glass windows for New College, Oxford (1785). Georg Facius also showed miniatures at the Royal Academy between 1785 and 1788, giving addresses in Leicester Fields and Soho. The brothers contributed four large-format plates to the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>, being paid the higher rate of &pound;367. In 1798 Farington reported that one or other Facius was among the many foreigners imprisoned, but he was bailed out by Boydell. One of their last jobs for Boydell was a plate after West's <span class="italic">Ascension</span>, published on 2 January 1797, though they were still active in 1813. <a name="cosubject_65507"></a><span class="headword">Jean Baptiste Michel</span>  (1738/1748&#150;1804)<span class="occ"></span>, born in Paris in 1738 or 1748, studied in that city under Pierre Chenu (1718&#150;1780), who had also worked for Boydell. Michel moved to London about 1780 and specialized in engravings combining line and stipple techniques. His first print for Boydell was <span class="italic">William de Albanac presents his three daughters to Alfred III, king of Mercia</span>, after West (published 9 November 1782), and plates for the <span class="italic">Houghton Gallery</span>. He also worked on two of the large-format plates for the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>, and was paid the higher rate of &pound;367. He is said to have produced more than thirty plates for Boydell over the years. Michel died in 1804.<br>
<br>Boydell's claim to have reinvigorated a native school of printmaking is borne out by the careers of a number of British-born engravers whose talents he actively cultivated. Prominent among these is the printmaker and draughtsman <a name="cosubject_8404"></a><span class="headword">Richard Earlom</span>  (1743&#150;1822)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of William Earlom and his wife, Margaret, baptized on 14 May 1743 at St Sepulchre, Holborn, where his father was the vestry clerk. He is said to have been introduced to the painter G. B. Cipriani through a neighbour in Cow Lane, Smithfield, a coach-maker who mended the lord mayor's coach (decorated by the Italian artist). He studied with Cipriani, and at the St Martin's Lane Academy and the duke of Richmond's gallery of casts. From 1757 to 1766 he frequently won premiums and prizes for drawing and for engraving at the Society of Arts, including in 1765 a premium for an original drawing of <span class="italic">Numa Pompilius Refusing the Roman Sovereignty</span>. He exhibited his prize-winning drawing of <span class="italic">The Dancing Faun</span> with the Free Society of Artists in 1762, and in 1767 exhibited the drawing after West of his <span class="italic">Story of Pyrrhus</span> (engraved by John Hall and published by Boydell in 1769). In 1773 he went to Houghton Hall, Norfolk, with George and Joseph Farington and Josiah Boydell to copy works in the collection, published by Boydell as <span class="italic">The Houghton Gallery</span> (1774&#150;88). His outstanding achievements for Boydell were the fifty-one plates after Cipriani intended for use by art students and the 300 plates after Claude, published as the <span class="italic">Liber veritatis</span> (1777&#150;1819). He was paid the unusually high rate of &pound;420 for the single large engraving he created for the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>, Fuseli's <span class="italic">Lear</span>. Although he worked predominantly for Boydell throughout his career, he also produced prints for the publishers Robert Sayer (notably the mezzotint after Zoffany's <span class="italic">Royal Academicians</span>, 1773), Laurie and Whittle, and B. B. Evans. He continued to work for Boydell &amp; Co. after John Boydell's death. A son, Thomas, is said to have died in 1789 aged only seventeen. Earlom is estimated to have produced more than 500 engravings, seventy portraits, sixty mezzotints, and many illustrations, including mezzotints to Thornton's <span class="italic">The Temple of Flora</span> (1799/1807) and Woodburn's <span class="italic">Portraits of Characters Illustrated in British History</span> (1810). He is noted as a considerable technical innovator, combining mezzotint with other techniques with particular delicacy. By 1817 his eyesight was failing, and he had retired from art. He died on 9 October 1822, at Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell, leaving an estate valued at nearly &pound;14,000, largely benefiting his widow and the children of his deceased daughter.<br>
<br>The printmakers employed by Boydell generally worked over a range of genres. <a name="cosubject_6151"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Cook</span>  (1744/5?&#150;1818)<span class="occ"></span>, a pupil of Simon Francis Ravenet, was a relatively minor figure who none the less undertook a range of projects for the publisher. In 1770 he won a silver pallet for drawing outlines of the human figure at the Society of Arts. Cook worked as a printmaker in a number of contexts, producing portraits for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and frontispieces for book publishers, as well as a number of single plates in different genres for Boydell. He was most famous for his reproductions of the works of Hogarth, published as <span class="italic">Hogarth Restored</span> in 1806. These were much scorned for their inferior technique. He also engraved the reduced reproductions of Hogarth for Nichols and Stevens's <span class="italic">Genuine Works of William Hogarth</span> (1808&#150;17). Cook died in 1818, probably in April, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, at the age of seventy-four, which may identify him as the Thomas Cook, son of William Cook and his wife, Judith, baptized at St Luke's, Old Street, on 18 January 1745.<br>
<br>Working primarily on reproductions of works by modern artists was <a name="cosubject_5970"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Collyer the younger</span>  (1748&#150;1827)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 14 September 1748, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5969/', "Joseph Collyer the elder (1714/15&#150;1776)")</script>, a translator and writer, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5971/', "Mary Collyer, n&#233;e Mitchell (1716/17&#150;1762)")</script>, also a writer. He was a pupil of Anthony Walker (<i>c</i>.1726&#150;1765), an engraver who worked for Boydell in the early 1760s (notably on Woollett's <span class="italic">Niobe</span> plate). On Walker's death, Collyer continued to study with the engraver's brother, William Walker. In 1761 he won a prize for drawing at the Society of Arts. Collyer enrolled as an engraver at the Royal Academy Schools on 14 March 1771, giving his age as &#145;22 last Sept&#146;. Having come to the notice of Boydell, he engraved for him a plate after Teniers, and subsequently reproduced works by contemporary artists, including Wheatley and Reynolds. He produced one large plate and two smaller prints for the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span> and also worked as a book illustrator. He exhibited engravings at the Society of Artists exhibitions of 1770, 1778, and 1780, and at the Free Society of Artists in 1779. Collyer was made an associate of the Royal Academy in 1786, and, with Earlom and <a href="#cosubject_9519">James Fittler [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was proposed as a director of the charitable Society of Engravers vaunted, unsuccessfully, in 1788. He exhibited engravings at the Royal Academy in 1789 and 1791&#150;2, and intermittently from 1797 to 1822, giving his address as 8 Constitution Row, Gray's Inn Road. He was appointed portrait engraver to Queen Charlotte, and was a member of the Stationers' Company, becoming master in 1815. He died at his home on Constitution Row on 24 December 1827.<br>
<br>A number of Boydell's engravers specialized in landscape imagery. Said to have been of French extraction, <a name="cosubject_16478"></a><span class="headword">Daniel Lerpini&egrave;re</span>  (1745&#150;1785)<span class="occ"></span> was born in London. With Fittler, he was Boydell's prime engraver of marines. He was a pupil of Francis Vivares, whose manner he followed in his own line-engravings. He exhibited with the Free Society of Artists between 1773 and 1779 and in 1783, giving addresses in Vauxhall Road and Lambeth. Lerpini&egrave;re seems to have worked exclusively for Boydell from the mid-1770s. He collaborated with Fittler on the large plates of the naval engagements of George Farmer and Captain Pearson, after Paton, issued by Boydell in 1780. In a list of plates issued in 1784 Boydell says he paid the engraver as much as 150 guineas for his print of <span class="italic">The Relief of Gibraltar</span>, after Paton, and 40 guineas each for <span class="italic">Morning</span> and <span class="italic">Evening</span>, after Cuyp and Pynaker respectively. Lerpini&egrave;re died at Walcot Place, Lambeth, in 1785. <a name="cosubject_9519"></a><span class="headword">James Fittler</span>  (1758&#150;1835)<span class="occ"></span> was born in London in October 1758. In 1776 he exhibited two sketches, including a portrait of General James Wolfe, with the Free Society of Artists, giving his address as &#145;At Mr Fittler's, Wells Street, near Germain Street, St James's&#146;. He enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools as a student of engraving in April 1778, giving his age as &#145;22 next Oct.&#146;, and in 1781 married Elizabeth Johnson. He exhibited at the academy from 1788 to 1824 and was elected an associate in 1800. Fittler was appointed marine engraver to George III. He also contributed one large plate and four small illustrations to the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>. In 1790&#150;91 he co-published with John Love <span class="italic">Views of Weymouth</span>, and he was copublisher with Robert Bowyer in 1795 of an illustrated <span class="roman">Bible</span>, losing, according to Farington, &pound;1500 in the venture. None the less, he later appears as publisher of engravings after John Claude Nattes's views of Scotland (1804) and a folio set of reproductions of Raphael's <span class="italic">Cartoons</span> (1810). According to Farington, his daughter married a hatter who went bankrupt, further aggravating Fittler's financial difficulties. His last published works were illustrations to Dibdin's <span class="italic">Aedes Althorpinae</span> (1822), after which he appears to have retired from art; his drawings and prints were sold off at Sothebys on 14&#150;16 July 1825. He died at Turnham Green on 2 December 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Chiswick.<br>
<br>Among the many engravers in the employ of Boydell specializing in landscape was <a name="cosubject_21683"></a><span class="headword">James Peak <span class="st"> [Peake]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;<em>c.</em>1782)<span class="occ"></span>, who may have been the son of James and Elizabeth Peak baptized at St Sepulchre, Holborn, on 2 May 1731. Intermittently between 1761 and 1771 he showed engravings with the Society of Artists, giving an address in Fleet Street and then &#145;At Mr Perrin's, Watchmaker, facing St Clement's Church&#146;. He produced etched views and prints in a great variety of genres, although predominantly landscape. For Boydell he worked on plates after Claude, George Smith of Chichester, Richard Wilson, and Pillement. His name appears as both Peak and Peake in the original exhibition catalogues and even on published prints. He is believed to have died around 1782. <a name="cosubject_5227"></a><span class="headword">Francis Chesham</span>  (1749&#150;1806)<span class="occ"></span> exhibited engravings at the Society of Artists in 1777&#150;8 and 1780. He worked for a number of publishers, specializing particularly in landscape views, although he also engraved, for instance, the designs of Charles Catton for the third volume of <span class="italic">The English Peerage</span> (1790). For Boydell, he engraved the plate of <span class="italic">Admiral Parker's Victory</span> (1782), after Robert Dodd, and two of George Robertson's views of Coalbrookdale, the others being by Lowry and Fittler. <a name="cosubject_22919"></a><span class="headword">John Pye</span>  (<em>b. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> after 1789)<span class="occ"></span> was a pupil of Thomas Major and won first prize in the competition for drawing the human figure at the Society of Arts in 1760. Between 1769 and 1773 he exhibited engravings with the Society of Artists, giving addresses at Lincoln's Inn Fields, Fenchurch Street, and finally 19 Cornhill. He enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy Schools in March 1777, giving his age as thirty-one. Pye specialized in landscape etchings, and for Boydell in the mid-1770s he produced plates after Cuyp, Claude, and Rembrandt and prints after Vernet and Kauffmann. Pye is said to have used the talents of <a name="cosubject_18663"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Middiman</span>  (1750&#150;1831)<span class="occ"></span> on plates published under his name only. Middiman was apprenticed in 1767 to William Byrne (1743&#150;1805), an engraver who had studied with Aliamet and Wille in Paris, and who worked for Boydell in the later 1760s. Middiman is also said to have worked with Woollett and Bartolozzi. He exhibited at the Free Society of Artists in 1771 and showed drawings and prints with the Society of Artists from 1772 to 1777, giving addresses in St James's Square and then Wells Street, Oxford Road. In 1780&#150;82 and 1795&#150;7 he exhibited drawings and stained drawings at the academy, giving addresses in Margaret Street, Winchester Row, and Warren Place. On 5 April 1788 he married Martha Woodyer at St Pancras. Middiman produced three large plates and one smaller illustration for the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>. As a specialist landscape etcher his skills were much in demand, and he is said to have worked on many plates issued under the sole name of other engravers, for instance John Pye. He produced the fifty-three plates for <span class="italic">Select Views in Great Britain</span> (1814) and sixteen plates for <span class="italic">Picturesque Castles and Abbeys in England and Wales</span> (1807&#150;11). About 1812 he gave up engraving and appears to have turned to landscape painting, exhibiting pictures at the British Institution in 1810&#150;11 and again in 1824. He died on 20 December 1831 at Cirencester Place, Westbourne Park.<br>
<br>Although Boydell's print production was dominated by landscapes and reproductions of old masters, his most significant contribution to British art can be considered the patriotic <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span> project conceived in 1786. Boydell employed more than forty different engravers for the large-format and quarto versions of the gallery's prints. A number of high-profile engravers, including William Sharp, Bartolozzi, Schiavonetti, and Earlom, were employed on a handful of the plates, being paid exceptionally high rates. <a name="cosubject_16345"></a><span class="headword">Francis Legat</span>  (1755&#150;1809)<span class="occ"></span> can be considered in this company. Born in Edinburgh, he studied at the Trustees' Academy in that city under Alexander Runciman and was a pupil of the engraver Andrew Bell (1726&#150;1810). In 1780 he moved to London, lodging at 22 Charles Street. His first prints for Boydell were <span class="italic">The Continence of Scipio</span>, after Poussin (published 1784), and <span class="italic">Mary, Queen of Scots</span>, after Gavin Hamilton (published 1786). Although he produced only four large prints for the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>, he was among the best paid of the engravers to work on the project. He was rewarded &pound;500 by Boydell for engraving Barry's <span class="italic">Lear and Cordelia</span> and &pound;450 for West's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>; only Bartolozzi and Sharp were paid more. By 1790 he had moved to Sloane Square, and in 1797 was living in Pleasant Row, where his mother died in 1799. In 1796 he exhibited at the academy <span class="italic">A Girl and Pigeons</span> and in 1800 <span class="italic">Maternal Solicitude</span>, indicating forays into original sentimental imagery. He later lodged with a Mr Proctor at Charles Street, Middlesex Hospital, the address given in the 1800 academy exhibition catalogue; this supports reports of financial difficulties later in life, despite his being appointed historical engraver to the prince of Wales. He died on 7 April 1809, apparently in a state of depression, and was buried at St Pancras Church.<br>
<br>More prolific in their contributions to the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span> were Anker Smith, <a href="#cosubject_65509">John Peter Simon [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_27177">Robert Thew [<i>see below</i>]</a>. <a name="cosubject_25773"></a><span class="headword">Anker Smith</span>  (1759&#150;1819), <span class="occ">printmaker and miniature painter</span>, was born in London, the son of William Smith, a silk merchant in Cheapside, and his wife, Mary, and was baptized at All Hallows, Honey Lane, on 5 March 1759. After a period at the Merchant Taylors' School, in 1777 he was articled to his maternal uncle, the attorney John Hoole, but encouraged by James Heath he turned instead to art. From 1779 to 1782 he studied with the engraver Taylor, and then worked as an assistant to Heath. In 1787 he was commissioned to engrave for Bell's <span class="italic">British Poets</span>, and from the same date he was employed as a line-engraver for Boydell and contributed ten small plates to the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>. In 1794 and from 1796 to 1800 he exhibited engravings and miniatures at the Royal Academy, and in 1797 he was made an associate of the academy. The catalogues record addresses in Chelsea, Old Bond Street, and finally Upper Ranelagh Street. Smith married Charlotte Susannah Snape, at St Andrew by the Wardrobe, on 1 November 1791. They had a daughter, Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 5 Nov 1792), and three sons who went on to be artists: <a name="cosubject_25799"></a><span class="headword">Frederick William Smith</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1797, <em>d.</em> 1835)<span class="occ"></span>, a sculptor and pupil of Chantrey, who died young on 18 January 1835; Edwin Dalton Smith (<i>bap</i>. November 1800), a miniature painter; and <a name="cosubject_25814"></a><span class="headword">Herbert Luther Smith</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1809, <em>d.</em> 1870)<span class="occ"></span>, a painter. He also adopted and trained his nephew the miniature painter William Charles Ross. Anker Smith was one of the original governors of the Society of Engravers, formed in London in 1803, and he produced illustrations after Singleton for editions of <span class="italic">The Arabian Nights</span> (1802), <span class="italic">Gil Blas</span> (1809), and <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1818). He died of apoplexy in London on 23 June 1819, his death being announced at the academy on 5 July that year.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_65509"></a><span class="headword">John Peter Simon</span>  (1764?&#150;<em>c.</em>1810)<span class="occ"></span> enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools on 31 December 1778, giving his age as &#145;14 1st August last&#146;, though most authorities give his date of birth as about 1750. Specializing in stipple, Simon contributed to Worlidge's <span class="italic">Collection of Drawings from Curious Antique Gems</span> (1768) and produced many prints after contemporary British artists, notably William Hamilton and Reynolds. He contributed to Boydell's <span class="italic">Houghton Gallery</span>, engraved individual plates, notably after Thomas Gainsborough's <span class="italic">The Woodman</span> (published 1791), and produced fifteen large plates and four small plates for the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>. This output included the small version of Opie's <span class="italic">Capulet Finds Juliet Dead</span> (1792), which was rejected by Boydell, who later commissioned William Blake to produce an alternative version. Simon's plates for the gallery are marred by the poor reproduction of the etched underdrawing. He is said to have died around 1810. <a name="cosubject_27177"></a><span class="headword">Robert Thew</span>  (1758&#150;1802)<span class="occ"></span> was born at Patrington, Yorkshire, the son of an innkeeper. He was reportedly brought up as a cooper, although it is also said that he served in his youth as a professional soldier. In 1783 he settled in Hull and either taught himself engraving or, more probably, received some training from a local practitioner. Despite these lowly beginnings, Thew came to the notice of Boydell, and from 1790 he worked very extensively on the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>. He produced twenty-one of the large-format reproductive prints. Thew, who was appointed engraver to the prince of Wales, died at Roxley, Stevenage, in July 1802.<br>
