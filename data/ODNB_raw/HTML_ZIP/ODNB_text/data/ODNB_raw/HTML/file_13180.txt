<span class="headword">Heywood,  Ellis</span>  (1529&#150;1578), <span class="occ">author and Jesuit</span>, was born in London, third of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13183/', "John Heywood (b. 1496/7, d. in or after 1578)")</script> and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. before 1574), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23149/', "John Rastell")</script> and Elizabeth More, Sir Thomas More's sister. Educated early at court, where his father (a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of More) was a playwright and music tutor, Heywood later attended Oxford. In 1548 he was elected fellow of All Souls College and graduated BCL on 18 July 1552. Thereafter he departed England to become secretary to Reginald, Cardinal Pole, in Italian exile. In 1556 at Florence, Heywood published <span class="italic">Il Moro</span>, a dialogue dedicated to Pole. In the humanist tradition of treatises on the <i>summum bonum</i>, the book represents Thomas More after he resigned as lord chancellor, jesting and conversing philosophically at his house in Chelsea, his imprisonment impending.<br>
<br>Before publishing <span class="italic">Il Moro</span>, Heywood had returned to England on the succession of Queen Mary; from 1554 he was prebendary of Eccleshall in Lichfield Cathedral. After the advent of Elizabethan protestantism, with his father and mother he departed England again, joining other members of his family in 1564 at Louvain. His uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23151/', "William Rastell")</script>, dying on 27 August 1565, bequeathed to Heywood the bulk of the family's estate. Near the end of 1566 he visited his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13182/', "Jasper Heywood")</script>, a Jesuit stationed at Dillingen in Bavaria, proposing himself to join the Jesuits and in turn to will them his inheritance. Despite concerns about his health Heywood was received into the Society of Jesus at Dillingen in December 1566. After several Bavarian postings he was transferred to Antwerp, where he served until his final days.<br>
<br>Before this last phase of Heywood's life he is said to have visited England, possibly to protect property against government confiscation. He returned without success to Antwerp in 1573; by 1574 his estate was forfeit to the crown. Heywood's ageing father was admitted into the Antwerp Jesuit community, but with other Jesuits both father and son were deported from Antwerp in May 1578, narrowly escaping death at the hands of Dutch troops and fleeing again to Louvain, where Ellis died on 2 October 1578.<br>
