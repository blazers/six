<span class="headword">Scoones, Sir  Reginald Lawrence</span>  (1900&#150;1991), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 18 December 1900 at Hermitage, Sutton Heston, Brentford, Middlesex, the son of Major Fitzmaurice Thomas Le Fevre Scoones, of the Royal Fusiliers, and his wife, Florence (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Osborne). General Sir Geoffry Allen Percival Scoones (1893&#150;1975), commander of the 4th army corps which defeated the Japanese at Imphal, Burma, in 1944, and subsequently commander-in-chief, central command, India (1945&#150;6), and British high commissioner in New Zealand (1953&#150;7) was an elder brother. He was educated at Wellington College, where he was captain of the rugby football fifteen, and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers in 1920. He transferred to the Royal Tank Corps in 1923, and was posted to Sudan, where he was a machine-gun officer with the Sudan defence force from 1926 to 1934. While there he married, on 7 November 1933 in Khartoum, Isabella Bowie (Ella) Nisbet, daughter of John Nisbet, of the Isles of Cumbrae, Scotland. They had one daughter. After returning to England Scoones became adjutant of 1st Royal Tank regiment (RTR) in 1936 and was appointed to the staff of the experimental mobile division, as a GSO3, in 1938.<br>
<br>In 1939 Scoones was posted, as brigade major, to the cavalry brigade in Cairo and became a GSO2 in General Richard O'Connor's western desert force. At this time the art of desert exploration was in its early stages and the expertise of the long range desert group and Special Air Service lay in the future, but Scoones, who was not unfamiliar with the desert, was able to organize desert reconnaissance which proved invaluable when the Italians, with massive numerical and armour superiority, invaded Egypt in September 1940. Fortunately the quality of the British forces and the generalship of O'Connor proved much superior to the Italians when O'Connor counter-attacked in December 1940. Two British divisions destroyed ten Italian divisions, took 130,000 prisoners, 380 tanks, and 845 guns, while themselves sustaining 500 killed, 1373 wounded, and 55 missing. The final battle was at Beda Fomm, 50 miles south of Benghazi in February 1941. Scoones was immediately appointed OBE for his part in this success. His next posting was as second-in-command of the 42nd RTR, and on 18 November 1942, when the &#145;crusader&#146; offensive was launched by General Sir Claude Auchinleck, there was a series of hard-fought battles around Sidi Rezegh, and 4th Indian division, which 42nd RTR was supporting, captured Sidi &#145;Umar. During these battles Scoones was promoted to command 42nd RTR. By the end of this campaign he had accumulated enough experience of tank warfare to make him an expert on instructional needs and he was posted back to the War Office as deputy director of military training.<br>
<br>In 1943 Scoones was appointed to take over command of 254 tank brigade in Burma, where the British and Indian troops were planning to advance across the Chindwin River. There he joined his oldest brother, Geoffry, who was commanding 4th Indian corps. However, while the British were planning to drive the Japanese out of Burma, the Japanese were preparing to launch an invasion of India; they had some success in the initial stages of their attack when they threatened Imphal by occupying a hill at Nungshigum on the northern edge of the Imphal plain. This move put them within range of the Imphal petrol and ammunition dumps and the Kangla airfield. The Japanese did not believe that tanks could climb hills but learned their mistake when the British tanks supporting the Dogras crawled upwards, though sustaining heavy casualties among their tank commanders who were obliged to control the battle by standing up in open turrets and directing their drivers through thick vegetation which obscured their view. Nungshigum was captured but with heavy casualties on both sides. Scoones was appointed DSO for his skill and courage in commanding the brigade, which he continued to do until he was wounded near Mandalay.<br>
<br>After recovery Scoones returned to the War Office, once again as deputy director, military training. In 1947 he was offered the appointment of assistant kaid (commandant) of the Sudan defence force. Three years later he was appointed kaid, in the rank of major-general. Although he was extremely popular with all ranks and enjoyed his appointment very much, the post was not without its difficulties. With the approach of independence (Sudan became a sovereign independent state in 1955 and a republic in 1956) he had the task of preparing for the handover of military authority to Sudanese officers. His advice was not invariably heeded. He intimated that officers from the north should not be posted to units in the south. When this happened it contributed to triggering off the civil war, which led to several coups and a particularly bloody conflict that continued for many years, with external influences also contributing to instability.<br>
<br>Scoones retired from the army in 1954 and was then appointed chairman of the brewing industry's National Trade Development Association. He was director of the Brewers' Society from 1957 to 1969. He was made OBE in 1941 and DSO in 1945, and was appointed CB in 1951 and KBE in 1955. Cully Scoones commanded widespread respect for his integrity and reliability, complemented by a splendid sense of humour which enabled him to defuse an impending awkward situation with an appropriate witty remark. A modest man, he always made light of his own achievements which ranged over command tactics, forward planning, and diplomatic skills. He died of heart failure and prostate cancer at the Westminster Hospital, London, on 6 October 1991.<br>
