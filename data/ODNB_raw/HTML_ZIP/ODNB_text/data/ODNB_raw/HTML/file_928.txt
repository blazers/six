<span class="headword">Axtell,  Daniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and regicide</span>, was baptized on 26 May 1622 at Great Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, probably the son of William Axtell (<i>d</i>. 1638), chief burgess of the town, and his wife, Dorothy Symons (<i>d</i>. 1629). He was apprenticed to a grocer in Watling Street, London, about 1638, and attended William Kiffin's Baptist congregation. He joined the parliamentarian forces during the first civil war, was captain in John Pickering's regiment of foot in April 1644, and major of the regiment, now commanded by John Hewson, in 1646, when he preached in Wallington church. He signed the regimental statement of soldiers' grievances in May 1647. In 1648 he suppressed disturbances in Kent and stormed Maidstone, and was given &pound;100 for being &#145;extraordinary active and diligent&#146;  (Firth and Davies, 2.407) in his capture of Deal Castle. He was the lieutenant-colonel of Hewson's troops at Pride's Purge but in the army council voted for radical motions and against Hewson and Ireton. He commanded the soldiers at the trial of Charles I in January 1649, at which he was later accused of threatening to shoot Lady Fairfax (wife of the lord general) for her interruptions of proceedings, of beating soldiers to make them cry &#145;justice&#146; and &#145;execution&#146;, and of insulting the king [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. In March 1649, on the command of the council of state, he arrested the Leveller leaders Richard Overton and Thomas Prince.<br>
<br>Cromwell's expedition for the reconquest of Ireland was launched in 1649 and Axtell accompanied Hewson's regiment, which suffered severe losses at the capture of Drogheda. He then helped Cromwell seize the headquarters of the confederate Catholics at Kilkenny, where he was appointed governor. Given command of a regiment, he marched from Kilkenny towards Athlone with 800 men, but was opposed by the marquess of Clanricarde, the royalist lord deputy. With reinforcements he then advanced to the peninsula of Meelick near Banagher, defended by 3000 Irish troops, and seized it in a hand-to-hand fight. Five hundred Irish were drowned in the Shannon, with only 300 escaping by swimming, and Clanricarde lost the castles he had recently captured. Axtell was suspended by Ireton, then in command in Ireland, and court-martialled for killing prisoners taken at Meelick after promise of quarter; he later justified the action on the grounds that God used him to suppress the Irish. Leaving Ireland, he was captured at sea and carried to the Isles of Scilly, then full of Irish soldiers who wished to kill him. Sir Richard Grenville's advisers, fearing retaliation, spared him, and he returned to Kilkenny as governor after Ireton's death.<br>
<br>With the rank of colonel Axtell sponsored the spread of the Baptist faith in Ireland by Christopher Blackwood and Thomas Patient. He was one of the representatives sent from Ireland to the first protectorate parliament in 1654. Following the rise to power of Henry Cromwell in Ireland, Axtell was among those who opposed his policies of accommodation and he resigned in November 1656 because &#145;the Godly were discouraged and wicked men countenanced&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 5.671). He retired to Berkhamsted Place, putting all his Irish lands on long leases, but returned to Ireland in 1658 on a mission to Henry Cromwell, who described him as &#145;well satisfied with the government&#146;  (ibid., 7.306&#150;7). Axtell, whose wife's name was Elizabeth, sent his son William to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1658, and his son Daniel to Lincoln's Inn in 1659.<br>
<br>With the fall of the protectorate Axtell was reappointed a colonel in Ireland under Edmund Ludlow, but was soon sent back to England to suppress Booth's rising. As divisions emerged within the army leadership he deserted General Lambert and declared for Fleetwood, then retired again, but decided to support Lambert's stand against Monck in April 1660. Although he escaped after the fight at Daventry he was captured, exempted from the bill of indemnity, and arraigned for treason for his actions in the king's trial. He unsuccessfully pleaded that what he had done was by the authority of parliament and that he had played no part in the king's death. Before his execution he prayed for the conversion of Charles II to a godly way of life and said, &#145;If I had a thousand lives I could lay them all down for the cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.1289). He suffered the full penalties for treason at Tyburn on 19 October 1660 and his head was set up on Westminster Hall; he was survived by his wife.<br>
