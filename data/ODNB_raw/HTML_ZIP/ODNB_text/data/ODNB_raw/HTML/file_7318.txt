<span class="headword">Davy,  Martin</span>  (1763&#150;1839), <span class="occ">physician and college head</span>, was the son of William Davy, a country gentleman of moderate estate at Ingoldisthorpe, Norfolk. He was educated first at Lynn School, and was afterwards a pupil of a Yarmouth surgeon. Later he studied medicine at Edinburgh, and adopted the Brunonian system of medicine promoted by John Brown (1735&#150;1788). His taste for classical scholarship had earlier gained him an introduction to Samuel Parr, and through Parr's influence he entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, at the age of twenty-three. There he held a scholarship, 1787&#150;91, and Dr Caius's medical fellowship, 1791&#150;1803; he returned to Edinburgh to complete his medical studies, graduating MB in 1792 and MD in 1797. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the mastership of Caius in 1795, and then spent two years in Europe, travelling for a period as tutor to Lord Ossulston (later the sixth earl of Tankerville), and visiting the antiquities of Rome and Naples. In Cambridge he practised medicine with considerable success, and continued to do so after his election as master of Caius in 1803. During 1803&#150;4 he was vice-chancellor of the university and became involved in a controversy touching his professional interests when he confirmed a restrictive interpretation placed upon the statute relating to medical study, in order to exclude a capable local practitioner, Frederick Thackeray (1774&#150;1852), from taking a medical degree. He was a strong whig, and on the occasion of Pitt's death he vetoed in the <i>caput</i> (21 March 1806) a scheme to erect a statue of him in the Senate House.<br>
<br>Davy's marriage at St George's, Hanover Square, on 16 May 1811, to an heiress, Anne, daughter of William Stevenson of Eccleshall, Staffordshire, coincided with a change in his profession. Having, it was said, been a religious sceptic, he took holy orders in 1810 and was admitted DD in 1811. After his wife's early death, on 9 October 1811, aged thirty-three, he devoted himself to private study in his library, which was well stocked with editions of classical authors. Their sale after his death realized &pound;1130. Elected to the Royal Society in 1801, he was a member of the Linnean Society, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1812). His only published work was a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Observations upon Mr Fox's Letter to Mr Grey</span> (1809), which exhaustively discussed C. J. Fox's usage of the word &#145;merry&#146; in the preface to his <span class="italic">History of the Early Part of the Reign of James the Second</span>.<br>
<br>Davy served for a second period as vice-chancellor in 1827&#150;8. In 1827 the tory ministry gave him the rectory of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, and in 1832 he received a non-residentiary canonry at Chichester, but he retained a reputation for religious liberalism, vetoing in the <i>caput</i> a petition opposing the bill to admit dissenters to the university (15 May 1834).<br>
<br>Davy was credited with having made his college more open by abolishing restrictions and making academic merit the avenue to college preferment; and the college certainly increased in repute during his time. His own subsequent reputation suffered, however, as a result of the unfavourable accounts of him given in the reminiscences of Henry Gunning, and in the diaries of Joseph Romilly. He died at Cambridge on 18 May 1839, and was buried on 25 May in the antechapel of his college. By his own request his papers were destroyed, which was done by boiling them in the large copper vessel of the college kitchen. He bequeathed his country retreat, an estate of 200 acres at Heacham, Norfolk, to his successors as master of Caius. In 1934 the trust was made over to the college.<br>
