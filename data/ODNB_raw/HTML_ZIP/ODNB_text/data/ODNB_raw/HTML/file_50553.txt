<span class="headword">Greening,  Edward Owen</span>  (1836&#150;1923), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist and social reformer</span>, was born on 17 August 1836 at Warrington, Lancashire. His father owned a small wire-drawing factory, and the family moved to Manchester in Edward's early years. There he attended the Quaker school in Mount Street and remained influenced by Quaker teachings all his life, although for most of his adult years he seems to have belonged to the Unitarian church.<br>
<br>Greening left school at thirteen and was apprenticed to the wire-working trade. In his middle teens he moved into office work, began to attend evening classes to remedy the deficiencies in his formal education, and at seventeen became involved in the Anti-Slavery Society, a Manchester organization which collected funds for the abolitionist movement in America. He also joined the temperance movement and later served on the executive committee of the United Kingdom Alliance.<br>
<br>Manchester was a major centre of support for the Northern cause in the American Civil War and it marked an important stage in Greening's intellectual and political development. He was a founder member of the Union and Emancipation Society, and served as one of its two honorary secretaries. He lectured in many parts of the country in support of the north and was a prolific correspondent and writer in the local and regional press, and, to a lesser extent, in national papers such as the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. His own political views moved steadily to the radical wing of the Liberal Party, and he helped to establish the Manchester and Salford Manhood League, a regional section of the Reform League, remaining closely involved in the suffrage agitation until the passing of the 1867 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>. He was also becoming involved in the growing co-operative movement, and was working with the leading personalities at the national level, including G. J. Holyoake, E. T. Craig, Lloyd Jones, and Thomas Hughes.<br>
<br>Greening's only direct intervention in politics was in 1868, when he was invited to stand for Halifax by a group of local radicals in the general election. Halifax was a two-member constituency, and one of the sitting MPs was a local industrialist, a conservative whig much disliked by the radicals. Greening joined forces with the other candidate, James Stansfeld, a friend of Mazzini and Garibaldi, and although unsuccessful he gained 2802 votes.<br>
<br>For the rest of his long life Greening worked within the various organizations of the co-operative movement. In 1868 he founded the Agricultural and Horticultural Association, popularly known as the One and All. He became its managing director and, as it was established in London, Greening left Manchester to live in the south. The object of the new association was to supply agricultural requirements&#151;tools, seeds, manure&#151;on co-operative principles, and in its early years it prospered. Greening also edited its main publications, including a widely circulated <span class="italic">One and All Gardening Annual</span>. His energy was remarkable and his involvement wide-ranging: in May 1869 he had taken a central part in the organization of the first national Co-operative Congress; he was a prime mover in the annual National Co-operative Festival held at the Crystal Palace between 1886 and 1910; and he was closely involved, with G. J. Holyoake and E. V. Neale, in the formation of the International Co-operative Alliance in 1895. He was a prolific writer on co-operative affairs, a lively and much sought-after speaker, and he travelled widely at home and abroad, as he recorded in <span class="italic">The Co-Operative Traveller Abroad</span> (1888).<br>
<br>The co-operative movement, as it grew steadily during the third quarter of the nineteenth century, developed a range of ideas about its role and future development. In the 1870s there arose a vigorous debate on the &#145;bonus to labour&#146; schemes whereby co-operative enterprises, especially those in manufacturing, should pay supplementary bonuses parallel to the dividend on purchases of the retail societies. Greening belonged to the group which favoured radical ideas for co-operative production, but they were in a minority, and with falling prices and economic depression after 1872 they were easily defeated by their more conservative opponents.<br>
<br>While Greening remained quite radical towards the co-operative movement, he was becoming steadily more conservative in his political ideas as the end of the century approached. The emergence of socialist ideas in the 1880s and the increasing demand for independent labour representation at Westminster met with his vigorous opposition and his continued adherence to the Liberal Party. Until the beginning of the First World War Co-operative Congresses rejected the calls for independent representation, although the minority views were growing steadily. The war years radically altered the position. At the 1917 Swansea congress a motion to seek &#145;direct representation in Parliament and on all local bodies&#146; was agreed by an overwhelming majority. Greening and Fred Madison had moved a dismissive amendment which received only 201 votes against 1979 for the substantive resolution.<br>
<br>Greening's own business collapsed in 1870 and thenceforth his income came from work in and about the co-operative movement. In his last years he was in some financial difficulties and these were in part met by at least two testimonial appeals. He had first married in 1860 Emily Hepworth, and they had several children, of whom at least one, E. W. Greening, shared his father's interest in the co-operative movement. His second wife survived him. Greening died at his home at Oak Lawn, Belmont Grove, Lee, Lewisham, on 5 March 1923, and he was buried in Hither Green cemetery.<br>
