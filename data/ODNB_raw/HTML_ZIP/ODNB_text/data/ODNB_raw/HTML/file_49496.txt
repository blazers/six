<span class="headword">Sword,  John Cuthill</span>  (1892&#150;1960), <span class="occ">road and air transport manager</span>, was born on 17 April 1892 at Groveside Cottage, Alexander Street, Airdrie, Lanarkshire, the son of William Sword, baker, and his wife, Jeanie Russell Cuthill. He attended elementary school at Airdrie and then started work with his father at the age of fourteen, before setting up in a bakery business on his own account. However, the First World War provided him, like many others, with an opportunity to broaden his horizons and change his career. Service in the Royal Flying Corps developed in Sword a passionate interest in motor vehicles and aviation.<br>
<br>Returning to Airdrie after demobilization, Sword married Christina Gillespie Taylor in 1918, daughter of another master baker. He then went into road haulage using war-surplus vehicles, and subsequently expanded into running bus services around Glasgow. His Midland Bus Services Ltd, established in Airdrie during 1924, rapidly extended its operations throughout south-west Scotland, and pioneered express coach services from Glasgow to Blackpool and London.<br>
<br>Sword was involved in a complex series of mergers and take-overs from 1929 to 1932 with four other Scottish bus operators and the London Midland and Scottish (LMS) and London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) companies, out of which he emerged as managing director of Western SMT Ltd, a division of Scottish Motor Traction of Edinburgh, on the main board of which he also sat. From its base in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Western SMT operated chiefly in south-west Scotland, though it continued to develop long-distance coach services, in spite of the fact that these competed with the railway companies, which controlled both Western SMT and its Edinburgh parent.<br>
<br>While managing Western SMT during the 1930s, Sword also diversified into several other businesses on his own account. These included farming, perhaps inspired by his passion for horses, and also the manufacture of potato crisps in Airdrie, Manchester, and Reading. Sword became an active director of the Scottish Amicable Building Society of Edinburgh, and had other business interests in London and Liverpool. But his greatest efforts were directed towards the development of civil aviation in the early 1930s. His instrument was Midland and Scottish Air Ferries Ltd, a private company incorporated in March 1933 with a nominal capital of &pound;20,000, held entirely by Sword and his wife. Based at Renfrew aerodrome near Glasgow, Sword's airline developed its first scheduled services in England, between Hooton in Cheshire, and Birmingham. This was followed by services linking Glasgow with Islay and Belfast, and Liverpool with Dublin. A London to Liverpool service was then set up, with onward connections to the Isle of Man and Belfast. Such was Sword's enthusiasm for the development of air travel that when a newly established rival lost the use of its sole aircraft as a result of an accident, Sword lent one of his to maintain its services. Sword also pioneered the air ambulance service between Renfrew and the Western Isles, and was a founder of the Scottish Flying Club.<br>
<br>The development of air services competing with their trunk routes was not popular with the railways, whose influence over Sword's core activity, Western SMT, was very powerful. They made determined efforts to stifle this competition. Travel agents who sold railway tickets were dissuaded from handling airline bookings; then the railways set up their own air services as a spoiling tactic. Eventually, the railway aviation interests and those of the pioneering private airlines were reconciled through a series of amalgamations, of which Sword's airline was an early casualty. His masters in LMS accused him of neglecting his responsibilities at Western SMT to run it, and they insisted he should sell it off. The airline was not profitable (nor were his farming or crisp manufacturing activities), whereas Western SMT provided Sword's main income, so he had no choice but to agree. Sword was compensated financially by SMT for sacrificing his airline, but seems to have resented the treatment he had received at the hands of the LMS, against which he appears to have borne a lasting grudge.<br>
<br>With the ending of his commercial aviation commitments in October 1934, Sword concentrated on running Western SMT, which was a very successful undertaking. His stewardship provided him with a handsome income, with which to subsidize his continuing unprofitable interests in farming and food-processing. With the nationalization of the railways by the Labour government in 1947, their subsidiary SMT metamorphosed into the state-owned Scottish Omnibuses group, of which Western SMT became a part. Sword ceased to be its general manager and became instead a director of Scottish Omnibuses.<br>
<br>As a business leader, Sword enjoyed the great gift of being able to delegate, while also following the course of the business. His early success was due in part to developing influential contacts with the air minister, Lord Londonderry. Both the air minister and the prime minister were guests at the launching of Sword's scheduled services between London and Belfast in April 1934.<br>
<br>After nationalization, Sword was able to devote more time to his family (he had four sons and a daughter) and to his private pursuits. As well as overseeing the work of his five Ayrshire dairy farms, he was also a noted horse breeder (at one time president of the British Hackney Horse Society) and collected paintings, clocks, railway models, and, above all, veteran and vintage cars. Some 250 such vehicles were housed at his farm, Balgray, near Irvine, Ayrshire, by the time of his death, and these were subsequently put on display in the Scottish Transport Museum in Glasgow. Sword died at Craigweil, Ayrshire, on 27 March 1960. His wife had predeceased him.<br>
