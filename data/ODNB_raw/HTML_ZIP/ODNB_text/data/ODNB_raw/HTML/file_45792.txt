<span class="headword">Cusack,  Margaret Anne</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Mary Francis Clare; <em>called </em> the Nun of Kenmare]</span>  (1829&#150;1899), <span class="occ">founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of Peace and writer</span>, was born on 6 May 1829 in York Street, Dublin, the elder of two children of Dr Samuel Cusack, a dispensary doctor, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stoney. Both parents came from a long tradition of Irish protestantism, the Cusacks claiming descent from Sir Thomas Cusack, one of Henry VIII's reformers influential in establishing the Church of Ireland. Sarah Stoney was of zealous evangelical settler stock, from Oakley Park, near Birr, King's county. Baptized into the Church of Ireland, Margaret Anne's early years were spent in borrowed splendour in a mansion near Coolock, even as the family fortunes dwindled. She developed a rebellious, imperious temperament in her efforts to compete with her younger brother, Samuel, for her mother's affection, and the isolation of her childhood led her to religious enthusiasm. From the age of nine she began to attend revivalist meetings at the home of her cousin, the Hon. Catherine Massy. When her parents separated, Cusack, aged fourteen, went with her brother to live with her Great-Aunt Baker in Exeter, Devon, and joined the Plymouth Brethren.<br>
<br>On the death of her fianc&eacute;, Charles Holmes, Cusack enrolled in the Anglican Sellonite sisterhood of Dr Pusey. Uncomfortable with the volatile Oxford Movement and sceptical of the motives of her religious superior, Priscilla Sellon, Cusack converted to Roman Catholicism and was received into the Catholic church on 2 July 1858 with the minimum of instruction. Aged thirty, she entered a Staffordshire convent of the Sisters of Penance but, dissatisfied, withdrew and returned to Ireland, where she immediately entered the Poor Clare Convent in Newry, co. Down, on 2 July 1859. For some years she enjoyed peace and fame, writing and publishing on a variety of subjects. She published in quick succession lives of St Francis, St Clare, and St Patrick, two volumes of Irish history, local histories of the counties of Cork and Kerry, a study of Daniel O'Connell, and a series of publications on the plight of poor girls. In all, she wrote about fifty books and pamphlets during her life.<br>
<br>Cusack was among those chosen to make a new foundation of Poor Clare nuns in Kenmare, co. Kerry, in October 1871. In 1879 famine devastated the west of Ireland and Cusack used her pen to raise funds and to expose the landlord system that created the famine, for which she also held the government responsible. Her particular target was the administration of the Lansdowne estate. Cusack's writings on the land question created many enemies, including Archdeacon Higgins, the Roman Catholic parish priest of Kenmare, who succeeded in isolating her from her religious sisters and having her transferred back to Newry in 1881.<br>
<br>An even stormier phase of Cusack's life now began. Impelled by her concern for the better training of female domestic servants, she launched her campaign to found a convent at Knock, co. Mayo, where she claimed that Archdeacon Cavanagh, the parish priest of Knock, had invited her to make a foundation. The difficulties she encountered in this project included not only canonical obstacles and misunderstanding about her mission, but also her own imperious temperament. She claimed visions and revelations, which seemed to exploit the local Knock apparition, so much so that the Catholic archbishop of Tuam, Dr McEvilly, considered her visions &#145;all bosh&#146; [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52701/', "Knock, visionaries of (act. 1879)")</script>]. He gave grudging permission for a foundation, but on 19 October 1883 withdrew that consent and ordered her to found a Poor Clare convent instead. Cusack insisted that she was making a new foundation, the Sisters of Peace. Deadlock ensued, and on the advice of her friend Cardinal Manning, after further humiliations she moved to England, where she made her foundation in Nottingham in the diocese of Bishop Bagshawe in 1884. She left behind her in Knock an impressive group of buildings, a convent, and two schools.<br>
<br>In February 1884 Cusack went to Rome to apply for a dispensation from her vows as a Poor Clare. The investigation of her case carried out by Roman authorities reflected the varied perceptions of those who met her. To some she was an excellent religious; to others her actions were incomprehensible and her fitness to found an order suspect. Two years later she went to the United States, instructed by Bishop Bagshawe to raise funds and open houses of the order of the Sisters of St Joseph of Peace. Only one bishop, Dr Wigger of Newark, New Jersey, welcomed her to his diocese. There she opened a holiday house for working girls, trained them, and placed them in service. In 1889 her first autobiography, <span class="italic">The Nun of Kenmare</span>, appeared. Convinced that her order would not prosper while she was the object of ecclesiastical disapproval, she left her religious community, resigning as leader in 1888. She also seceded from the Roman Catholic church. She strove to make her living by lecturing on her experiences to mainly protestant audiences. Her final conversion, in 1895, was to Methodism, and her last writings, for instance <span class="italic">Revolution and War: the Secret Conspiracy of the Jesuits in Britain</span> (1910), reflected her anti-clerical hostility towards the Church of Rome. She returned to England and died at 21 Lansdowne Crescent, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the home of protestant evangelical friends, on 5 June 1899. Eccentric and wilful, she never abandoned her pursuit of justice for the poor. In 1974 she was officially recognized by Rome as the founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of Peace but remains a controversial figure.<br>
