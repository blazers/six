<span class="headword">Holbeach <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Rands]</span>,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1551), <span class="occ">bishop of Lincoln</span>, is of obscure birth but certainly took his name in religion from his Lincolnshire place of origin. His family name was Rands. He became a Benedictine monk of Crowland and subsequently proceeded to Cambridge, where he became BTh in 1527 and DTh in 1534. He was made prior of Buckingham College, the Benedictine house for students in Cambridge which for a time provided hospitality for Thomas Cranmer. It also offered Holbeach the opportunity to undertake reformed biblical and patristic studies. It is uncertain whether he stayed on in Cambridge following his doctorate, but the deep impression he made on Cranmer, by then archbishop of Canterbury, as one of only two &#145;of that habit, that be of better learning, judgement, conversation and all qualities meet for an head and master of an house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings and Disputations</span>, 2.310) resulted in his election as prior of Worcester on 13 March 1536, the king's assent being granted on the 22nd. He took the customary oaths of succession and supremacy, and was probably delighted that one of his first acts as prior was to receive the visitation of Hugh Latimer, the newly appointed bishop of Worcester. Among the new bishop's injunctions was a requirement of the prior to provide a whole <span class="roman">Bible</span> in English for the convent, and to have a chapter of it read each day at dinner. The friendship between prior and bishop, which may have begun at Cambridge, resulted in the consecration of the former as suffragan bishop of Bristol in 1538. Two years later, however, the priory was surrendered to the king, and on 24 January 1542 Holbeach was appointed dean of the new foundation of Worcester, with prebendaries, minor canons, lay clerks, organists, choristers, and schoolmasters, to say nothing of forty king's scholars under his charge&#151;a rather more numerous required foundation than the monastery had boasted at its dissolution. He did not preserve the collegiate character of Worcester, and it was not long before dean and canons dined apart, while in the year of his appointment the dean supervised the demolition of the images of St Oswald and St Wulfstan. He also acquired the reputation with contemporaries for so exploiting the lands of the cathedral church that by 1559 neither he nor his successors left &#145;a patch of land sufficient for a horse to graze upon&#146;  (Wilson, 371).<br>
<br>Holbeach's reputation at Worcester did not prevent his translation to the see of Rochester in 1544, his election on 3 May receiving royal assent on the 26th, and he was made king's almoner in the same year. His growing reputation was recognized in his selection to preside at the funeral of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, in 1545, and in his attendance at Henry VIII's funeral. He was appointed preacher at the commemoration of the death of Fran&ccedil;ois I of France in June 1547. Holbeach commended Fran&ccedil;ois &#145;for setting forth of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in the French tongue to be read of all his subjects&#146;  (Wriothesley, 1.184). He also preached to celebrate the victory at Pinkie, fought on 10 September against the Scots, which suggests that he had the favour of the duke of Somerset. This resulted in his confirmation as bishop of Lincoln on 20 August 1547, but not without the gift of thirty manors and the episcopal palace at Holborn in London to the protector. On the latter's fall Holbeach received thirty-six rectories, formerly appropriated to monastic houses, which had already been leased out by the court of augmentations, together with the return of the manor of Buckden and such buildings as remained of Thornton Abbey. So inequitable was the exchange that the see of Lincoln from being one of the richest in England became one of the poorest.<br>
<br>Holbeach was in demand, however, to advance a protestant order in England and especially to support Thomas Cranmer in forwarding the preparation and defence of a vernacular liturgy. He assisted in the framing of the offices and in the very famous discussions on the drafts of the 1549 prayer book that came before the bishops in 1548 and were debated in the House of Lords in November. His was a reformist position in recognizing the elements as &#145;mystically&#146; the body and blood of Christ  (Tomlinson, 44). His cathedral received him late; he was not installed at Lincoln until 20 March 1548, more than six months after his election and confirmation as bishop. It saw some of the first experiments with the liturgy in English. Virtually nothing survives of Holbeach's activities as a diocesan, but at a national level he fought critics of the prayer book, such as Stephen Gardiner, as well as the Anabaptists who saw no point in it at all. He was a reliable supporter of Cranmer, whether on a commission to dissolve an unfortunate royal marriage of William Parr (brother of the dowager queen) in 1547, or to make sure that the University of Oxford was brought in line with the new order in 1549. Like the archbishop, Holbeach probably married in 1544 if not earlier; his wife was Joan Manett. His was a radicalism based on scripture and it is possible that his extravagance in parting with the temporalities of the see was prompted by a monastic experience of thrift as much as by his desire to promote the cause of reform on the bench of bishops. He seems to have spent his last years at Nettleham and died there on either 5 or 6 August 1551.<br>
