<span class="headword">Schindler, Sir  Albert Ashershund  Houtum-</span>  (1846&#150;1916), <span class="occ">Persian scholar and employee of the Persian government</span>, was born in Germany on 24 September 1846. No details are known of his family background, early life, or education. Some sources suggest that he was in fact Dutch, though educated at Leipzig University, but during his own lifetime he divulged no information to biographical dictionaries, and in a brief obituary note his son was unable, or reluctant, to add any details. His extraordinary career in Persia began in 1868 as an employee in the Indo-European telegraph company, which recruited several of its engineers and superintendents from Germany. In 1876 he joined the Persian telegraph service as inspector-general of Persian telegraphs and was given the rank of general in the Persian army, though he was never in any sense a soldier. He established a close relationship with the minister of telegraphs, &#145;Ali Quli Khan, Mukhbir al-Dauleh. He was responsible for extending the telegraph system to some of the regional centres. He was also employed by the shah in mining for gold in Azarbaijan, and by Mukhbir al-Dauleh in managing the turquoise mines in Khorasan. In 1870 he married Louise, who was the eldest daughter of a Swedish physician, Conrad Fagergen (1818&#150;1879), resident for many years in Tehran and Shiraz, and the granddaughter of an Italian general in the Persian army, Barthelemy Semino. She died about 1879, and a few years later, in 1884, he married an English woman, Florence.<br>
<br>From the late 1880s Houtum-Schindler played an important part in the more systematic attempts of Persian and European capitalists and entrepreneurs to explore and develop the country's natural resources. His advice was important in establishing the Imperial Bank of Persia in 1889, and he was subsequently appointed as its inspector of branches, as well as inspector-general of the Persian Bank mining rights corporation. He was also nominally in charge of the road concessions held by the bank. Neither of these subsidiaries flourished, and he was dismissed in May 1894. Thereafter he was nominally director of Persia's foreign office control department but, as he put it himself, &#145;used as advisor to the Government in nearly all matters&#146;  (RGS, correspondence, block 1881&#150;1910. Houtum-Schindler to John Scott Keltie, secretary of the RGS, 4 Sept 1896), or, in Curzon's description, &#145;a sort of <i>deus ex machina</i> required to assist in the solution of most Persian problems&#146;  (Curzon, 1.477). He stayed on in Tehran through the years of the &#145;constitutional revolution&#146;, living in his house situated between the Austrian legation and Mukhbir al-Mulk's property just north of Lalehzar. For a time he was in charge of the passport office in the ministry of foreign affairs, and was the honorary Swedish consul-general. He eventually left Persia in the spring of 1911, disappointed at what he felt was the lack of appreciation of his years of long service to the Persian government. The government of India made him a CIE in 1900, and a KCIE in 1911.<br>
<br>In the course of the forty-two years that he had spent in Persia, Houtum-Schindler acquired more precise information about the state of the country than any other European had ever done, either before or most probably since. While supervising the telegraph and mining operations he travelled extensively throughout the Persian empire, across the central plateau, into the tribal areas and the most remote border regions, often leaving Tehran for months at a time. Everywhere he went he collected precise details of distances, routes, archaeological and historical sites, dialects, ethnography, flora and fauna, and population and revenue statistics. He frequently surveyed the territory, and his accurate readings helped to produce maps of the regions through which he travelled. As a result of his friendship with leading Persian notables and ministers he had access to official government records and used them in the many published descriptions of his itineraries. His unique access to these sources of information made him invaluable to the European commercial organizations for whom he worked, foreign legations, and the governments of India and Persia. Unusually self-effacing himself, he allowed others to make use of his remarkable knowledge, notably Lord Curzon who obtained from Houtum-Schindler most of the detailed statistical information on the army, population, distances, revenue, and much else in his great work, <span class="italic">Persia and the Persian Question</span> (1892), and generously acknowledged that &#145;few men so excellently qualified to write a first-rate book themselves would have lent such unselfish exertion to improve the quality of another man's work&#146;  (Curzon, 1.xiii).<br>
<br>To his study of Persia, Houtum-Schindler brought the exactitude and industry of a genuine scholar <i>manqu&eacute;</i>. His understanding of literary and colloquial Persian was impressive; he built up a valuable library, and published over fifty articles in the leading English, German, and Austrian orientalist and geographical journals of the day, as well as encyclopaedias and reference works. His most important study was the one book which he compiled himself, <span class="italic">Eastern Persian Irak</span> (1896), a meticulous account of the region between Tehran and Esfahan. His work on the Zoroastrian community in Yazd and Kerman, &#145;Die Parsen in Persien, ihre Sprache und einige ihrer Gebr&auml;uche&#146;  (<span class="italic">Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;ndischen Gesellschaft</span>, 36, 1882), and his pioneering studies on dialect, are still of value, as is the accurate information provided in the many succinct, exact accounts of his travels. Some of the rare manuscripts he collected came from the libraries of great nineteenth-century Persian bibliophiles and scholars such as Bahman Mirza, Farhad Mirza, and I&#145;timad al-Saltaneh. The best of those manuscripts and lithographs, with some of his translations and annotations, were bought after his death by E. G. Browne, and subsequently went to the Cambridge University Library.<br>
<br>After his return from Persia in 1911, Houtum-Schindler, who had become a naturalized British subject (probably in 1884, but certainly by 1888), settled at first in Wimbledon and then at Fenstanton, a few miles outside Cambridge. Although crippled by gout and increasingly house-bound, he re-established his acquaintance with the two Cambridge orientalists, E. G. Browne and Guy Le Strange, both of whom he had met many years earlier in Persia. He died at his home, Petersfield, Fenstanton, Huntingdonshire, on 15 June 1916, leaving his wife, Florence, and two sons, Alexander, who had joined the Imperial Bank of Persia, and Leonard.<br>
