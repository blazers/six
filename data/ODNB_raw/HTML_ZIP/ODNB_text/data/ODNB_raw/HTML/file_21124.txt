<span class="headword">Paget,  William</span>, seventh Baron Paget  (1637&#150;1713), <span class="occ">politician and diplomat</span>, was born at Beaudesert, Staffordshire, on 10 February 1637, the oldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21123/', "William Paget, sixth Baron Paget (1609&#150;1678)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Frances Rich (<i>d</i>. 1672), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23484/', "Henry Rich, first earl of Holland")</script>, and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir Walter Cope of Kensington. Nothing is known of his education and early life, except that in January 1656 he was given a pass to travel abroad. By licence dated 20 July 1661 he married Frances (<i>c</i>.1644&#150;1681), daughter of Francis Pierrepoint, younger son of Robert Pierrepoint, first earl of Kingston. Following the death of his father on 19 October 1678 Paget took his seat in the House of Lords (25 November 1678). There was a strong puritan element in the Pagets: his father had adhered first and last to the parliamentarians in the civil war, despite a short-lived attachment to the king in 1642&#150;4; his father's sister Anna had two notable puritan husbands, and his mother belonged to one of the most famous puritan magnate families in England. Paget himself, by temperament and conviction, clearly remained throughout his life in the puritan/radical whig interest. In 1681 he was a signatory to the petition against the convening of parliament at Oxford, where he opposed the Lords' rejection of the impeachment of Edward Fitzharris as a conspirator in the Popish Plot. In the same year, after the death of his first wife, Paget married his cousin Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1685), daughter of Sir Thomas Irby of Boston, and of his father's sister Katherine.<br>
<br>Paget's own whig sympathies prevented his political advancement under the later Stuarts. In 1688 he was present at the trial in the Lords of the seven bishops, and on the landing of the prince of Orange Paget was one of the peers who unsuccessfully petitioned James II to call a free parliament and to negotiate with William; subsequently he voted for the vacancy of the throne and for settling the crown on the prince and princess of Orange. On 24 December 1688 he moved in the Lords that the princess of Orange should be declared queen. Following the accession of William and Mary, Paget was appointed lord lieutenant of Staffordshire (patent 24 March 1689; sworn 15 May). A few months later, on 4 September 1689, he was appointed English envoy to Vienna. At fifty-two Paget embarked on what was to be a lengthy diplomatic career in the king's service. At this point in his life he was twice a widower, and had lost both his elder son by his first marriage, William (<i>d</i>. 1684), and his only son by his second wife, also William (<i>d</i>. 1687). He never remarried; it is not clear how far the tragedies of his private life precipitated or magnified in diplomatic exile his known austerity of manner and almost Roman stoicism, as well as his conspicuous patience and on occasion notoriously short temper. With only one short break in London, in summer 1692, Paget remained abroad from September 1689 until April 1703, living first at the court of the Habsburg emperor, Leopold I, in Vienna and then, from 1693 to 1703, at the Ottoman court, living either at the English embassy at Constantinople or in uncomfortable circumstances at Adrianople, now Edirne, the principal residence of successive Ottoman sultans in the latter part of the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>William III's aim, in appointing Paget to Vienna in 1689, was not only to cement his alliance with the emperor, but to add weight to his existing policies, carried on by Dutch diplomats in the field, of extracting the emperor by mediation from the conflict in Hungary with the Ottomans, which had been going on since 1683 and which was becoming increasingly successful, in order to free the best imperial generals and the emperor's most seasoned troops for the conflict against the armies of Louis XIV on the Rhine and in the Low Countries. In the event William's attempts at mediation were less than successful. Early in autumn 1692, following the successive deaths of two English ambassadors to the Porte (Sir William Hussey, who had died at Adrianople in summer 1691, and William Harbord, who had died at Belgrade a year later), the king transferred both Paget and his Dutch colleague Coenraad van Heemskerck from Vienna to the Porte in an effort to force the pace of the mediation diplomacy. At Vienna Paget was succeeded by George Stepney; at the Porte, Paget's strenuous but cautious advocacy of William's policies met with little immediate success, partly as a result of deep-seated personal animosities between Paget and van Heemskerck, partly because of the continuing primacy of pro-French grand viziers in the counsels of successive sultans, and the insurmountable difficulties of long-distance diplomatic communication between the Porte, Vienna, The Hague, and London. It was not until late in 1697, after the conclusion at Rijswijk (Ryswick) of peace in the west between William III and Louis XIV on 11 September and of the destruction at the battle of Zenta on 12 September of the Ottoman army and the main military leaders of the pro-French war party, that Paget was able to induce a new Ottoman regime to agree to a mediated peace with Austria and its Sacra Liga allies. Paget's subsequent roles, as chief intermediary in the year-long preliminary negotiations, as co-mediator with his Dutch colleague Jacobus Colyer, and as joint chairman at the congress of Carlowitz (Karlof&ccedil;a; Karlofci) from 2 November 1698 to the conclusion of peace on 26 January 1699, mark the culmination of his diplomatic career. Paget remained at the Porte for almost four more years, returning home loaded with honours from both the Ottoman and Habsburg rulers, some months after the death of William III.<br>
<br>Paget arrived in London in April 1703. On 24 June, after an interval of nearly fourteen years, he was reappointed lord lieutenant of Staffordshire. His later years were uneventful. Having professed his personal faith in his will of 14 April 1711, he died at his London house in Bloomsbury Square on 26 February 1713 and was buried in the church of St Giles-in-the-Fields on 20 March. His sole surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21110/', "Henry Paget (c.1663&#150;1743)")</script>, later created earl of Uxbridge, the younger son of his first marriage, succeeded to the title.<br>
