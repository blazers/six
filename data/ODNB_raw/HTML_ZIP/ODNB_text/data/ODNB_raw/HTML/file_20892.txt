</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Shanassy, Sir  John</span>  (1818&#150;1883), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, was born at Ballinahow, near Thurles, co. Tipperary, Ireland, the son of John O'Shanassy, a surveyor, and his wife, Margaret Dwyer. After his father died in 1831 he left school and was apprenticed to a Tipperary draper and wine and spirits merchant. In 1839 he married Margaret McDonnell (<i>d</i>. 1887) of Thurles, and in July of that year the couple sailed for New South Wales, encouraged by a relative who had previously gone to Sydney. Their vessel called at Melbourne in the new settlement at Port Phillip. O'Shanassy was persuaded not to travel further and bought a small property, Windriet, near Western Port. The venture failed and in 1845 he commenced a more successful career as a draper in Melbourne. In 1849 he was able to buy cheaply some crown land in inner North Melbourne, which soon became very valuable.<br>
<br>An intelligent, outspoken man, with a deceptive fa&ccedil;ade of popular radicalism in these early years which belied his true conservatism, O'Shanassy quickly gained public prominence. From 1845 to 1851 he was president of the St Patrick's Society, founded in 1842 to &#145;preserve in this colony&#146; the memory of Ireland. In 1846 he briefly held a seat on the Melbourne council, and in the late years of the decade he was involved in opposition to the transportation of convicts to Port Phillip and in the campaign for separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales.<br>
<br>Upon separation in 1851 O'Shanassy was elected to the first Victoria legislative council and became effective leader of the opposition to the conservative official, nominee, and squatting members who dominated the council. In 1852 he was a member of the select committee on the goldfields, in 1853&#150;4 of the committee which drew up the new Victoria constitution, and in November 1854 of another commission on goldfields. This last commission became more important following the Eureka rebellion of December 1854, and its major recommendations included the miners' right and provision for immediate miner representation on the legislative council.<br>
<br>O'Shanassy's business activities widened and prospered. He promoted building societies and was chairman of the Colonial Bank of Australasia from its formation in 1855 until 1870. He built a mansion, Tara, on a 16 acre property in the then outer suburb of Camberwell. He was the leading lay Roman Catholic in the colony, and one of the first trustees of the public library.<br>
<br>At the first elections under the new constitution in September 1856, O'Shanassy was elected to represent Kilmore, which he held until December 1865. He was a major figure in the unstable, faction-ridden early years of the Victoria parliament. He briefly held power from 11 March 1857 to 24 April 1857 and from 10 March 1858 to 27 October 1859, and more extensively and successfully in the second parliament, from 14 November 1861 to 27 June 1863. In these years he drifted towards more conservative positions on many issues, including free trade. He was greatly concerned to promote Catholic interests in matters such as state aid for religion and denominational education. His third government was notable for two pieces of legislation, the 1862 <span class="roman">Common Schools Act</span> and the 1862 <span class="roman">Crown Lands Act</span>, which was promoted by his lands minister and fellow Catholic, Charles Gavan Duffy.<br>
<br>Upon losing office for the third time O'Shanassy became part of the minority opposition to the McCulloch government, defending free trade and the powers of the legislative council during the early stage of the constitutional crises of the mid-1860s. He retired from parliament in December 1865 and left in May 1866 to travel to Europe, visiting Ireland and England, and Rome, where he was appointed a knight of the order of St Gregory for his services to Catholic education. He arrived back in Melbourne in July 1867.<br>
<br>By now O'Shanassy had begun acquiring significant pastoral interests in New South Wales and Queensland and was largely allied with those who had previously been his political enemies. Significantly, he became a member of the legislative council, having been elected in May 1868 for Central Province, a seat he held until April 1874. He was now at odds with Duffy, whose government of 1871&#150;2 he strongly opposed and whose defeat ironically paved the way for the 1872 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, which abolished state aid to church schools and introduced secular education to government schools, both anathema to O'Shanassy.<br>
<br>After another visit to Europe in 1874, in 1875 O'Shanassy chaired a royal commission on the volunteer forces. He twice tried unsuccessfully to re-enter the assembly before being elected for Belfast in May 1877. In parliament he focused on the fight to reintroduce state aid, and with a small group of followers with whom he held the balance of power contributed to a new period of political instability from 1878 to 1882. He lost his seat at the elections of March 1883.<br>
<br>O'Shanassy was created CMG in 1870 and KCMG in 1878. He died on 5 May 1883 at Camberwell, Victoria, survived by his wife, two of his three sons, and his three daughters. He was buried on 6 May at Hawthorn, Victoria. Ambitious and egocentric, he was none the less vigorous in promoting economic development and the interests of his church.<br>
