<span class="headword">Haward, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1617&#150;1704), <span class="occ">courtier and antiquary</span>, was the third son of John Haward (<i>c</i>.1571&#150;1631) of Tandridge Hall, Surrey, and his first with his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Angell, gentleman pensioner to James I. In November 1635 Haward&#151;his own preferred spelling of the name&#151;was granted special admission to the Inner Temple as the son of a bencher. Soon afterwards he purchased Tandridge Hall and two Surrey manors worth &pound;600 per annum from his older half-brother John. From 1641 to 1646 he served as gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I, who knighted him on 9 September 1643 at Sudeley Castle. Five days earlier, in the garrison at Oxford, he had married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1689), youngest daughter of John Acton, a London goldsmith. She brought with her a dowry of &pound;1250, and in due course they had six daughters and four sons. In the autumn of 1645 Haward retired to Tandridge, claiming in his petition to compound of the following April that he had never borne arms. His fine, fixed in January 1647 at the rate of one sixth of his estate, totalled &pound;437.<br>
<br>Although Evelyn dismissed Haward as &#145;a greate pretender to English antiquities &amp;c&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 6 Dec 1671), Aubrey pronounced him &#145;a learned Gentleman and great <i>Antiquary</i>&#146;  (Aubrey, 3.36). Dugdale too thought him &#145;well accomplisht with learning especially in points of Honour and Armes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life &hellip; of Sir William Dugdale</span>, 32). By 1663, when he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, he had already begun to collect or make copies of monastic and genealogical records. His transcripts are executed in a bold and regular script well suited to the large folio format in which he preferred to work. Examples range from a volume of genealogical, heraldic, and historical material that includes a copy of a Glastonbury chartulary (BL, Add. MS 58216), by way of Becher's account of the amours of Henri IV of France (BL, Sloane MS 841), to an important 700-page miscellany that mingles Restoration verse, scandal, and politics with history, commerce, and much else (Bodl. Oxf., MS Don. b. 8). Peter Le Neve, who in 1695 bought an even larger antiquarian compilation (BL, Harleian MS 3875), along with two original chartularies (BL, Harleian MSS 391, 4809), drew up a list of twenty-seven Haward manuscripts purchased by Lord Chancellor Somers in 1697 (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 888, fol. 41<i>v</i>). Several of these later found their way to the earls of Oxford and are now BL, Harleian MSS 4785, 4786, 6016, 6025, 6166, 6193, 6266, and 6829. A catalogue of Haward's library belonged to Richard Rawlinson  (sale catalogue, Barnard, 4 March 1733/4, lot 387).<br>
<br>At the Restoration Haward resumed his post in the household, retaining it under each successive sovereign until 1702. From 1661 to 1678 he sat in the Cavalier Parliament for his father's old seat of Bletchingley and was moderately active for the court party, serving on some seventy committees. In 1672 he gave money towards rebuilding the College of Heralds, though he failed five years later in his bid to become Garter. Three years after the dissolution of parliament he sold his Surrey estate and bought an interest in the Broken Wharf waterworks, while continuing to occupy his official lodging in old Scotland Yard. In the following decade he was constrained to sell his collection of manuscripts. His wife was buried in Westminster Abbey cloisters on 24 March 1689. In May 1704, when aged almost ninety, he petitioned Queen Anne for relief but did not long enjoy it, being buried on 28 July in St James's, Piccadilly.<br>
