</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simpson,  Christopher</span>  (<em>c.</em>1602&#150;1669), <span class="occ">composer and musician</span>, was the eldest son of Dorothy Pearson (<i>d</i>. 1628) and Christopher Sympson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1580, <i>d</i>. in or after 1616). Originally from Nottinghamshire, the family had settled in Yorkshire by the mid-sixteenth century. Simpson was probably born at Egton in the North Riding, where his parents moved after their marriage. In official documents his father is described as a &#145;cordwainer&#146; (shoemaker), but he was also actor&#150;manager of a theatre company patronized by wealthy Catholic families in the area. This duality may be explained by the need for Catholic recusants, such as the Simpsons were, to maintain a discreet profile during a period of religious and political turbulence.<br>
<br>That nothing is known of Simpson's education, formidable as it was, or his early career, probably reflects such considerations. Indeed, a tantalizing theory has been propounded  (Urquart, &#145;Was Christopher Simpson a Jesuit?&#146;) that Simpson may have led a double life and is to be identified with a contemporary named Simpson (or Sampson) who received a Jesuit education on the continent, leading to ordination in 1629. Many features of the career of this Yorkshire-born priest, who finally returned to the Jesuit college of St John at Durham in 1649, are not entirely incompatible with the composer's known activities. The evidence for the musician's death in 1669, however, is at odds, at least on the face of it, with the notification from London to the Jesuit authorities in Rome of the priest's death on 3 March 1674.<br>
<br>Simpson first emerges from obscurity about 1642 during the civil war, when he enlisted in the royalist army under William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle, at York, where Charles I had established a base in response to the threat from Scotland. In the summer of 1643 Newcastle's forces were in Lincolnshire, and it was probably there that Simpson came into contact with Sir Robert Bolles, a noted patron of music, of Scampton manor, just north of Lincoln. Some time between 1645 and 1649 Simpson became resident musician and tutor to Sir Robert's son John. Simpson had earlier inherited from his father Hunt House, a smallholding at Pickering, but he settled this property on his nephew Christopher, and continued to reside with the Bolles family, either at Scampton or in London, until the end of his life.<br>
<br>As a theorist, Simpson first contributed to Playford's <span class="italic">A Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick</span> (2nd edn, 1655), providing annotations to a chapter based on a short treatise by Thomas Campion (1613). He established a national reputation with <span class="italic">The Division-Violist</span> (1659), a viol tutor culminating in a comprehensive elucidation of the art of spontaneous extemporization over a repeated bass theme, then a widely practised and highly esteemed art. He dedicated the first edition to Sir Robert Bolles, under whose roof &#145;the work had both its conception and production&#146;  (dedication), and the second (1665) to his highly talented son, for whose use the treatise was written. With a view to exploiting the continental market, the latter edition incorporated a translation into Latin. Roger L'Estrange, himself an accomplished amateur violist, wrote in his foreword: &#145;Whoever has this book by him, has one of the best tutors in the world&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1665 Simpson published a modest primer on the rudiments of music, <span class="italic">The Principles of Practical Musick</span>, dedicated to another young pupil, Sir John St Barbe, whom he had begun to teach in 1663. A much enlarged treatise, <span class="italic">A Compendium of Practical Musick</span>, followed in 1667, dedicated to the duke of Newcastle. The first part is based on <span class="italic">The Principles</span> and is followed by four additional sections devoted to composition, discords, figurate descant, and canon respectively. By 1775 the <span class="italic">Compendium</span> had reached its ninth edition and even Burney, who was sceptical of the efficacy of such publications, acknowledged &#145;the considerable merit of its clearness and simplicity&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 3.473).<br>
<br>Simpson's compositions were written almost exclusively for consorts of viols, or mixed consorts, in various combinations with continuo, or for solo viol. They were widely disseminated in manuscript copies, but none was printed in his lifetime, apart from those included in his treatises for illustrative purposes. Reflecting the growing ascendancy of the violin family during the seventeenth century, it is evident that the treble parts in consort pieces, including those ostensibly for viols, were increasingly played by, and sometimes even conceived for, the violin. Furthermore, two divisions on a ground specifically for violin were attributed to Simpson and published posthumously by John Playford in <span class="italic">The Division-Violin</span> (1684).<br>
<br>In his treatise on the making of divisions Simpson affirmed that it was essentially an improvisatory art; at the same time, in the sets of divisions he wrote down, a remarkable inventiveness, melodic gift, structural grasp, and delight in instrumental display are evident. His <span class="italic">Twenty 4-Part Ayres</span> are grouped by key into suite-like sets, each one containing one or two airs interspersed within a succession of dances&#151;pavans, galliards, courantes, and sarabands&#151;and written for the relatively uncommon combination of two trebles and two basses. These pieces, with their subtle varieties of texture, may well have been inspired by the similarly scored works of Simpson's distinguished colleague and friend John Jenkins.<br>
<br>Many important sources for Simpson's music are now preserved at the British Library, the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and the Henry Watson Library, Manchester. Modern editions of his works include four fantasia-suites in <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>, twelve virtuoso fantasias in <span class="italic">The Months</span>, <span class="italic">A Little Consort</span> for lyra viol, treble viol, and bass viol, <span class="italic">Six Sets of Divisions</span> for treble and bass viol, and <span class="italic">Twenty-Two 3-Part Airs</span>, in which a tendency towards a polarity between the two upper parts and the bass suggests the pervasive influence of the Italian trio sonata.<br>
<br>Simpson made his will at Lincoln on 5 May 1669, and it was proved in London on 29 July. He died at a house of Sir John Bolles, probably that in Holborn, but possibly Scampton Hall in Lincolnshire; exactly when is not known. Simpson was widely recognized as one of the most accomplished musicians of his generation. Thomas Mace placed him alongside Jenkins and William Lawes at the pinnacle of their profession:<blockquote>These three famous men &hellip; by their most singular and rare works <i>they live</i>; and may so easily be distinguished, the one from the other, and as exactly known, which is which, as if they were present in person, and should speak words. (Mace, 151)</blockquote>Matthew Locke, the most prominent English composer immediately after the Restoration, praised Simpson as &#145;a person whose memory is precious among good, and knowing men, for his exemplary life and excellent skill&#146;  (Locke, 32).<br>
