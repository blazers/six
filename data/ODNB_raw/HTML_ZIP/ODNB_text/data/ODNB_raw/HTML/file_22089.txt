<span class="headword">Phelips, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1614), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the fourth and youngest son of Thomas Phelips (<i>c</i>.1500&#150;1590) of Montacute, Somerset, and Corfe Mullen, Dorset, and his wife, Elizabeth Smyth (<i>d</i>. 1598), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73530/', "Matthew Smyth")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71874/', "Smyth family (per. c.1500&#150;1680)")</script>], a merchant, of Bristol. His father, former servant to Thomas Cromwell and Protector Somerset, was a successful grazier in Somerset and Dorset, whose own parliamentary service provided the political base for three of his sons. Phelips's education at New Inn and Middle Temple was sponsored by his cousin, the treasurer, Matthew Smyth. Called to the bar in 1579, he established a lucrative career in chancery and in the court of Star Chamber, where his political connections proved crucial. He was appointed autumn reader in the Middle Temple in 1596.<br>
<br>Phelips's legal career was synonymous with his political life. His first seat, Bere Alston, in the 1584 parliament, was under the patronage of his legal client the marchioness of Winchester. His 1586 seat for Weymouth had been previously held by his father, grandfather, and a cousin. He sat for Penryn in 1593, and Robert, second earl of Essex, married to a Somerset connection, was his likely patron for the 1597 seat for Andover. In 1601 he was selected junior knight of the shire for Somerset, just as his impressive mansion at Montacute was being completed alongside the public highway which connected the county seat at Ilchester and the muster grounds on Ham Hill. The intersection of his legal and political careers was evident in his selection as queen's serjeant-at-law in February 1603. When the group of fourteen serjeants were invested in May 1603, Phelips was chosen as James I's serjeant-meane, with &#145;precedence before all others&#146;. His patrons were Thomas Sackville, earl of Dorset, and Thomas Egerton, then lord chancellor, both supporters of the accession of James I; he was knighted in July that year. In February 1604 he was returned again for Somerset and he was elected speaker on 19 March. Both honours recognized his service to the new sovereign and his chief ministers.<br>
<br>Phelips's political and legal career was devoted to the preservation of governmental order: as justice of common pleas in the county palatine of Lancaster from 1604, he was noted for his prosecution of recusancy; as king's serjeant he opened the indictment against the gunpowder plotters in 1606; as speaker he effectively represented the crown interests. He was rewarded with the reversion of the mastership of the rolls in 1608, succeeding in January 1611, the chancellorship of Prince Henry's re-established duchy of Cornwall in 1610, and the rangership of all royal forests, parks, and chases in 1613. He was also a minor literary patron. He sponsored his father's godson, George Coryate, in Prince Henry's household, and paid Thomas Chapman and Inigo Jones for their Middle Temple masque written for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth. However, the cost of such a public career was high. His expenses, such as the lavish house at Montacute and the entertainment of James I at his leased house at Wanstead, required more funds than the rewards from his political career. The untimely death of Prince Henry in 1612 may have deprived him of future grants.<br>
<br>By the time of his sudden death at Rolls House in London on 11 September 1614, Phelips was &pound;12,000 in debt. His political credit had been eroded, with James I due to his objections to the <i>post nati</i> issue and among his peers in Somerset over the contested election in March 1614 when his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22090/', "Sir Robert Phelips")</script>, failed to secure a seat. With his first wife, Margaret Newdigate (<i>d</i>. 1590), daughter of Robert Newdigate of Hawnes, Bedfordshire, he had two sons, Sir Robert and Francis. By his second marriage, to Elizabeth Pigott (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of Thomas Pigott of Dodershall, Buckinghamshire, he had one son, Edward. He was buried at St Catherine's Church, Montacute, on 25 September 1614. The family held the mansion at Montacute until 1931, when it was donated to the National Trust.<br>
