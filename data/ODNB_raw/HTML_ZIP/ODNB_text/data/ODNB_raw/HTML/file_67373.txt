<span class="headword">Webbe,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1624<span class="mult">x</span>6?), <span class="occ">Ranter</span>, first achieved notoriety in 1644 when he was arrested by order of the House of Lords for blasphemous preaching in London. At this point, he was a feltmaker and hatmaker living in Southwark. He was charged with the more advanced heresies of his day, asserting the primacy of immediate, divine inspiration by rejecting the historical Christ, the literal truth of scripture, and the immortality of the soul. Some of his alleged opinions were couched in the crude and provocative terms later attributed to the libertine antinomians known as Ranters, such as that a drunkard did the will of God and that God knew no difference between the flesh of the best saint and the flesh of a toad. Under examination by divines from the Westminster assembly he denied the more extreme heresies and grosser statements attributed to him but stood by his commitment to the primacy of personal spiritual inspiration. Thomas Edwards, the London Presbyterian minister who publicized Webbe's errors in his heresiography <span class="italic">Gangraena</span> (1646), alleged that he had recanted to secure his liberty; Webbe answered in print that he had been cleared of all charges. According to Edwards, Webbe was twenty or twenty-one years old.<br>
<br>Webbe embarked on a career of itinerant preaching during the last years of the civil war and by 1647 had acquired the living of Langley Burrell, in Wiltshire, allegedly by promising not to collect his tithe. A colourful account of Webbe's pastoral care was published in 1652 by Edward Stokes, a Wiltshire magistrate, based on the extensive documentation he had collected for the parliamentary committee for plundered ministers, which ejected Webbe in 1651. In the winter of 1649&#150;50 Webbe lost his wife, married a woman called Mary (who, according to Stokes, was Webbe's third wife), but also took as his mistress the patron's wife, Mary White. He attempted to resolve the resulting friction between wife and mistress by setting up a commune in the manor house which became the centre of a libertine sect. He procured the seduction of his wife by a young rustic and took for himself a &#145;man-wife&#146; named John Organ of Castle Combe. Thoroughly debauched, Organ abandoned his wife and children, acquired a mistress, and took to the life of itinerant preaching with Webbe's blessing. Stokes sought to discredit Webbe as a libertine antinomian and published evidence of his connections with the notorious group of Ranters led by Abiezer Coppe. Webbe was accused of Ranter-like opinions, including that Moses was a conjuror and Christ a deceiver. Preaching and lying were alike to him; he could sleep with any woman except his mother. In Ranter style, Webbe's sect were said to &#145;curse and swear, sing lewd songs, and drink prophane and blasphemous healths&#146;  (Stokes, 31). However, Webbe was never charged under the <span class="roman">Blasphemy Act</span> of August 1650 which proscribed his sect's doctrines. Rather the move against him came from his own followers. In September 1650 his mistress accused him of various sexual offences; Webbe publicly repented and the case went no further. The next month two disciples accused parson and mistress of adultery, a capital offence under an act of May 1650, both with each other and various members of their group. However they were acquitted by the assize jury.<br>
<br>By August 1651 Webbe was under investigation by the committee for plundered ministers. His enthusiastic opinions were duly catalogued, along with the immoral behaviour they were assumed to promote. He was also accused of rejecting all political authority and supporting the radical Levellers. Other charges were more specifically designed to secure his ejection, notably that he had excluded the lawful incumbent and wasted the glebe. Webbe lost his living in September 1651 and, after a brief pamphlet skirmish with Stokes in 1652, returned to the obscurity whence he came. Webbe's last known appearance may have been in 1654, when a Thomas Webbe was tried at the Old Bailey for an adultery committed in London the year before: the prosecution referred to his dangerous principles and opinions of four or five years earlier. During his brief period of notoriety Webbe furnished the opponents of religious radicalism with damning evidence of the moral anarchy produced by the collapse of civil and ecclesiastical authority during the English revolution.<br>
