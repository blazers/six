<span class="headword">Perrin,  Louis</span>  (1782&#150;1864), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Waterford on 15 February 1782, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21978/', "Jean Baptiste Perrin (fl. 1767&#150;1798)")</script>, a teacher and author of school textbooks, and his Irish wife, whose maiden name was Daly. Perrin's father was born in France, but settled in Ireland, where he taught French to the Irish gentry. Perrin was educated at home and at the diocesan school at Armagh. On 7 November 1796 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he gained a scholarship in 1799 and graduated BA in 1801. During the court trial in which his fellow student and friend Robert Emmet was sentenced to death, he rushed forward to embrace the prisoner when the verdict was announced. Perrin studied mercantile law and was called to the Irish bar in Hilary term, 1806. In April 1815 he married Hester Connor Stewart; they had seven sons.<br>
<br>Perrin's father had been a supporter of nationalist ideals and Perrin soon distinguished himself as an uncompromising reformer, as well as an able barrister. When Watty Cox, the proprietor and publisher of <span class="italic">Cox's Magazine</span>, was prosecuted by the government for libel in 1811, three defence lawyers&#151;Daniel O'Connell, Isaac Burke Bethel, and Perrin&#151;were hired, but the case was in effect conducted by Perrin who, though the most junior of the four, was clearly able. He was also junior counsel, in 1811, in the prosecution of Edward Sheridan, Thomas Kirwan, and the Catholic delegates, for violating the <span class="roman">Convention Act</span>. In 1832, he became a bencher of King's Inns, Dublin.<br>
<br>Perrin was a whig in politics, supported Catholic emancipation, and acquired the sobriquet of &#145;Honest Louis Perrin&#146;. On 6 May 1831 he was elected MP for Dublin. He was unseated in August and returned for Monaghan on 24 December 1832, displacing Henry Robert Westenra, the previous tory member. At the next general election he was elected for the city of Cashel, on 14 January 1835, but he resigned in the following August in order to take his seat on the bench. At the bar Perrin was one of the recognized heads of the protestant liberal party, which advised and co-operated with Roman Catholics. While a third serjeant and MP Perrin wrote a report on the inquiry into municipal corporations, which was used as the foundation for the <span class="roman">Irish Municipal Reform Act</span>.<br>
<br>Perrin was made third serjeant on 7 February 1832. He later became first serjeant (from February to April 1835) and then attorney-general (29 April 1835). He was appointed a puisne justice of the king's bench, on 31 August 1835; and in the same year he became a privy councillor. He was remembered as an able and upright judge.<br>
<br>Perrin resigned on a pension in February 1860, and moved to Knockdromin, Lusk, near Rush, co. Dublin, where he frequently attended the petty sessions. He died at Knockdromin on 7 December 1864, and was buried at Rush on 10 December.<br>
