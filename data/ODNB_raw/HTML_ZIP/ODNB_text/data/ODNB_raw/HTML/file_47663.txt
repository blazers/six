<span class="headword">Biddulph,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1734, <em>d.</em> 1800), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was baptized at Ledbury, Herefordshire, on 3 March 1734, the last of eight children of Robert Biddulph (1682&#150;1772) and his wife, Anne, daughter of Benjamin Joliffe of Cofton Hall, Worcester. He had five brothers and two sisters, though two brothers and both sisters had died before Biddulph was born. Biddulph never married and had no children. His eldest brother, Michael Biddulph (1724&#150;1800), became his next of kin following the death of his father in 1772; his mother died in 1760.<br>
<br>Biddulph's involvement in metropolitan financial circles dates from the early 1750s when he was active in the City of London, probably as a goldsmith. Like many others of this trade before him, Biddulph soon made the transition to bona fide banker and by about 1755 was in business in St Paul's Churchyard. In 1757 he decided to establish a new and independent banking house and asked an old Herefordshire neighbour, Sir Charles Cocks of Eastnor, near Ledbury, to send someone to London to assist the new enterprise. Thus it was that James and Thomas Sommers Cocks, sons of Sir Charles, joined Biddulph to form the house of Cocks, Biddulph &amp; Co., in St Paul's Churchyard. In 1759 the firm moved to 43 Charing Cross, in the City of Westminster.<br>
<br>The nature and conduct of the banking business at Charing Cross were shaped in part by Biddulph's character and provincial origins. Cocks, Biddulph &amp; Co. were considered exceptionally discreet, even among the somewhat closed world of the aristocratic West End banks. Such discretion attracted some notable customers, including the dukes of Gloucester and Northumberland, the bishop of London, the Oxford colleges of Exeter and Brasenose, and the dean and chapter of Lincoln Cathedral. The bank also acted as agent in the capital for a number of country banks in Wales and the west, and for Hereford and St David's cathedrals. Thus Biddulph combined the provision of personal banking services to the aristocracy and gentry with interests in the church and provincial trade and industry. He moved not only between London and the provinces, but also among the many distinct social worlds of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Biddulph lived for much of his life in the banking house in Charing Cross, within the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He died, intestate, in Brighton on 25 October 1800. On the death of his brother Michael in December 1800, a large part of his considerable fortune went to Michael's son Robert Biddulph, MP for Hereford.<br>
