<span class="headword">Clowes,  William</span>  (1582&#150;1648), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was the son of the distinguished surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5716/', "William Clowes (1543/4&#150;1604)")</script>. He was apprenticed to his father and admitted to the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company of London on 22 January 1605. When called to the livery of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company on 13 December 1615 he was already surgeon to the prince of Wales and because of his royal duties was allowed to attend lectures and company functions only when convenient to him. He became sergeant-surgeon to the king on the prince's accession as Charles I in 1625 and subsequently declined to serve as renter warden (in seniority, the fourth warden of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company), considering the office to be too lowly for a king's surgeon.<br>
<br>The records that survive of Clowes's career mainly concern matters of controversy. In 1626 he was chosen to be master of the Barber&#150;Surgeons but his election was called into question because by convention it was the turn of a barber that year. The election was allowed to stand, but the wardens of the company's yeomanry were fined for not carrying the standing cups before him, suggesting that some opposition remained.<br>
<br>One of the duties of the king's surgeon was to examine all persons brought to be cured by the royal touch and in this capacity Clowes complained of a man called Leverett, a gardener, who claimed to be able to cure the king's evil (scrofula). Clowes was directed by the court of Star Chamber to refer the matter to the College of Physicians of London, and Leverett appeared at the college on 3 November 1637, claiming to be able to cure just by touch a range of diseases. When Leverett failed to cure cases given to him Clowes presented a memorial stating that Leverett slighted the king's sacred gift of healing, enticed lords and ladies to buy the sheets he had slept in, and deluded the sick with false hopes. Clowes also produced further evidence that Leverett was an impostor, including the proof that he was a fourth, not a seventh son. The college duly reported its findings to the Star Chamber.<br>
<br>Clowes's second term as master, in 1638, also began controversially. The election was unable to proceed because the first set of barber electors could not agree and were therefore discharged. Six more electors were chosen but two refused to serve. After fresh electors were chosen Clowes and the new wardens were sworn in. Just prior to Clowes's mastership the famous anatomy theatre designed by Inigo Jones had been added to the company's building in Monkwell Street. Clowes was a substantial contributor to the building fund. The new theatre was required because of the increased demand for lectures and dissections, stimulated by William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood, as well as advances in surgery.<br>
<br>In April 1641 it was reported in the court minutes of the Barber&#150;Surgeons that Clowes, following a complaint by one of the wardens, had been ordered to acknowledge that in his anger and passion he had spoken &#145;some words to the wrong&#146; of the court. Later in the same year, on 30 September, Clowes was one of the seven examiners in surgery who made various orders concerning the reading of lectures, perhaps aimed at raising or maintaining standards; these included the requirement that surgery lectures were to be read by approved surgeons only, and that the lecturers were to have a month's notice to prepare. Clowes's last appearance in the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company was on 14 September 1648 and he died later that year. By his will of 28 March 1630 he left his property to Sara, his wife, and to his three children, James, Ann, and Sara.<br>
