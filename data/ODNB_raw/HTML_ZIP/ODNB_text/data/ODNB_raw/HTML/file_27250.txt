<span class="headword">Thomason,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1602&#150;1666), <span class="occ">bookseller and collector of civil-war tracts</span>, was the son of George Thomason, husbandman of Sudlow, Cheshire, where Thomason may have been born (some sources suggest he was born at Westham in Sussex). He was apprenticed to Henry Fetherstone, bookseller at The Rose in St Paul's Churchyard, London, on 29 September 1617, and became free of the Stationers' Company on 5 June 1626. Soon afterwards Fetherstone ceased publishing and Thomason took over the management of his business.<br>
<br>Thomason's name appears in the Stationers' register from November 1627, initially in partnership with Octavian Pulleyn, with whom he published six titles. The partnership was dissolved in 1643 and Thomason moved to new premises at the Rose and Crown, St Paul's Churchyard. He was notable as an importer of continental books and as a supplier of the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge universities, regularly attending the Frankfurt book fair; he also visited the Low Countries, Germany, and Switzerland for business purposes. He advertised 2000 works that had been collected during a trip to Italy following his wife's death in 1646, describing them in Latin as &#145;more Rabbinical and Oriental books and manuscripts than have ever before been collected together&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue of Pamphlets</span>, vi). Parliament authorized purchase on behalf of Cambridge University, where they formed the basis of the oriental collection, but there is no evidence that he received payment.<br>
<br>In 1645 Thomason was implicated in the anonymous publication of David Buchanan's <span class="italic">Truth its Manifest</span>, which attacked parliament and was burnt by the hangman. After publishing in 1646 Philip Freher's <span class="italic">Treatise Touching the Peace of the Church</span>, he published nothing until 1659, when Rushworth's <span class="italic">Historical Collections</span> appeared under Thomason's imprint. He played an active role in the financial administration of the Stationers' Company from 1641. After 1645 he began to press for democratic reforms within the company's elections. In 1651 he was assistant warden, junior warden in 1657, and senior warden in 1661, when he was involved in re-establishing the company's business following the Restoration.<br>
<br>About 1631 Thomason married Catharine Hutton (<i>d</i>. 1646), Henry Fetherstone's niece and ward. The couple had many friends among the presbyterian party, including William Prynne, Henry Parker, John Rushworth, and Edmund Calamy. Other family friends included Edward Reynolds (later bishop of Norwich), Thomas Lockey, (keeper of the Bodleian Library), and the poet John Milton, who wrote his sonnet 14 to the memory of Catharine. Following Catharine's death in 1646, Thomason never remarried; his will spoke of his &#145;late dear and only wife&#146;. The couple had at least nine children, six of whom were living in 1664. The eldest child, also named George, became a prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral in 1683; the remaining survivors were named Katharine, Edward, Grace, Henry, and Thomas.<br>
<br>In 1642 and 1643 Thomason was a parish collector of subscriptions for the parliamentary army, and in 1646 he was involved in a petition to the lord mayor and common council supporting the presbyterian petition. The following year he became a common councillor for the ward of Farringdon Within. After King Charles's surrender in 1647 Thomason and other members of the council called for a personal treaty with the king; they were thereafter deprived of office following Pride's Purge in December 1648. After the execution of Charles I in 1649 he became involved in the overtures between the presbyterians and Charles II, known as the Love conspiracy. He was implicated in the plot and arrested in April 1651, and he spent several weeks in prison at Whitehall before being bailed for &pound;1000 at the end of May. His estate was seized but later restored to him, and he was not prosecuted. Milton may have interceded on his behalf at this time. Thereafter he suffered bouts of illness, due to his imprisonment, and he ceased political activities. Thomason died at Mickleham, Surrey, and was buried in the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West on 13 February 1666 (although Richard Smyth says he was &#145;buried out of Stationers' Hall (a poore man) 10 Apr 1666&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue of Pamphlets</span>, xiii). His will, dated 1664, included legacies to his children, grandchildren, servants, the Stationers' and the Haberdashers' companies, St Paul's Cathedral, and St Dunstan-in-the-West. However, by his death he was in reduced circumstances, indicated by later codicils.<br>
<br>Thomason's name is remembered for his remarkable collection of political and religious tracts between 1640 and 1661. In 1641 he &#145;systematically began his collection, acquiring, either by purchase or occasionally by presentation, every book, pamphlet and newspaper issued in London, and as many as he could obtain from the provinces or abroad&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue of Pamphlets</span>, v). According to Falconer Madan, &#145;Thomason's achievement is unparalleled in its kind&#146;  (Madan, 292), encompassing more than 22,000 items in over 2000 volumes, subsequently catalogued in twelve volumes, either by him or by his friend Marmaduke Foster, book auctioneer. His practice of adding the dates of publication or acquisition on the works' title-pages has proved invaluable in establishing the chronology of events during this turbulent period, and his marginal notes identify anonymous authors and the clandestine manner in which some works were distributed. The comprehensiveness of this collection, and the historical value of the two surviving manuscript catalogues, were the subject of detailed analysis and debate in the journal <span class="italic">Albion</span> in 1988 and 1990.<br>
<br>After Thomason's death his collection was subject to many vicissitudes, but remained intact. The works were acquired from his descendants by the bookbinder Samuel Mearne for Charles II, about 1678. Mearne rebound them, but was never paid and the collection remained in his family. For eighty years members of the Mearne and Sisson families repeatedly tried to sell the collection to the Bodleian Library, Cambridge University, Prince Frederick, and others, without success. Eventually, in 1761, it was sold to George III for &pound;300, and was presented to the British Museum in 1762.<br>
