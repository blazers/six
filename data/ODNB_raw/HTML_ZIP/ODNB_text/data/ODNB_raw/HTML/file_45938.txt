<span class="headword">Villiers, Sir  Charles English Hyde</span>  (1912&#150;1992), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 14 August 1912 at 21 Ampthill Square, St Pancras, London, the only son and the older of the two children of Algernon Hyde Villiers (1886&#150;1917), a stockbroker, grandson of the fourth earl of Clarendon, and his wife, Beatrice Eleanor (<i>c</i>.1891&#150;1978), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35417/', "Herbert Woodfield Paul MP")</script>. His father was killed in action in November 1917, and his mother later married Walter Durant Gibbs, fourth Baron Aldenham, and had two more sons.<br>
<br>Charles Villiers was educated at Eton College, and after working for a few months as assistant to the Revd &#145;Tubby&#146; Clayton, founder of Toc H, he spent two years working for the merchant bank Glyn Mills before going to New College, Oxford, in 1933 to read philosophy, politics, and economics, graduating with a second in 1936. He returned to Glyn Mills, and on 9 June 1938 he married Pamela Constance Flower (1913/14&#150;1943), daughter of Major John Flower: she died, with the child, at the birth of their second son on 17 October 1943.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the Second World War Villiers fought at Dunkirk with the Grenadier Guards, and was later transferred to the Special Operations Executive. In 1944 he was parachuted into Austria and Yugoslavia, where he helped to organize the Yugoslav resistance: in 1970 the Yugoslav government awarded him the Order of the People in recognition of this. By the end of the war he had reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel. On 1 October 1946 Villiers remarried: his second wife was Countess Marie Jos&eacute; de la Barre d'Erquelinnes (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of Count Henri de la Barre d'Erquelinnes of Jurbise, Belgium: they had two daughters. After the war he returned to banking, joining Helbert Wagg &amp; Co., and specialized in corporate finance. He was made a partner in 1948, and when the bank merged with J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co. in 1960 to become Schroder Wagg, Villiers became a managing director.<br>
<br>In 1968 Villiers was appointed managing director of the Industrial Reorganization Corporation (IRC), set up by the Labour government in 1966 under the chairmanship of Sir Frank Kearton to rationalize industries and promote mergers, in order to improve the international competitiveness of British industry. Villiers was very successful in handling these delicate negotiations, and the IRC usually achieved the result it wanted, including the merger of GEC and English Electric and the creation of British Nuclear Design and Construction in 1968, and British United Trawlers in 1969. When the IRC was wound up in 1971 he returned to merchant banking as chairman of Guinness Mahon &amp; Co. Ltd. He also served as chairman of the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation from 1972 to 1973. He was knighted in 1975 for services to industry.<br>
<br>Villiers succeeded Sir Monty Finniston as chairman of the British Steel Corporation (BSC) in 1976, and spent four difficult years trying to rationalize the steel industry and ensure its survival at a time when BSC's markets were crumbling, and the crisis in the steel industry was deepening. He embarked on a programme of closures, and clashed with the select committee on nationalized industries in November 1977 when he refused to disclose details of his plans to steer BSC through the crisis. In March 1978 his strategy for the future, &#145;The road to viability&#146;, which abandoned the ten-year development strategy adopted in 1973, was presented to parliament; by then he was about to announce losses of &pound;443 million for 1977&#150;8. He agreed to delay financial reconstruction until BSC broke even, which in June 1979 he predicted would be in March 1980, and continued closing loss-making plants&#151;eleven steelworks altogether. But Sir Keith Joseph, the new secretary of state for industry, announced that the government would not finance BSC losses after March 1980. BSC was still losing &pound;1 million a day, and after Villiers closed the Consett steelworks in November 1979, with the loss of 4000 jobs, and announced a further 52,000 redundancies, and a pay rise of only 2 per cent, at a time when the rate of inflation was 17 per cent, union opposition to the reduction in the size of the steel industry culminated in a three-month national steel strike, starting in January 1980. The strike cost BSC over &pound;200 million, and led steel-using industries to switch permanently to imported steel.<br>
<br>Villiers's strategy began to work under his successor, Ian MacGregor, appointed in 1980 after the strike ended, but only when the government, realizing that BSC might be forced into liquidation, reversed its stand and pumped billions of pounds of public money into the company to ensure its survival with a view to future privatization. Until 1989 Villiers remained chairman of BSC (Industry) Ltd, the subsidiary set up to encourage new industries to move into former steelmaking areas, to provide jobs for former steelworkers. Villiers published <span class="italic">Start Again Britain</span> (1984), an analysis of the problems facing British industry. His interests included Anglo-American relations, and in 1985 he set up the British American project for the successor generation. He was a trustee of the Royal Opera House, and chairman of the Theatre Royal, Windsor. He died from cancer on 22 January 1992 at his home, Blacknest House, Sunninghill, Ascot, Berkshire.<br>
