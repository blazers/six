<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Crosby,  (Thomas) Frederick Gordon</span>  (1885&#150;1943), <span class="occ">motoring artist</span>, was born at 7 Park Place East, Sunderland, co. Durham, on 25 July 1885, the second child and only son of Thomas Crosby (1837&#150;1911), shipbroker, and his wife, Annie Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jeboult (1855&#150;1927). His parents married in Exeter in 1882, and had a daughter who was born there in 1884 before they moved to Sunderland. In 1886 his mother obtained a judicial separation and returned with the children to Exeter where her family ran a glass, china, and art pottery business. His father remained in Sunderland where his financial position deteriorated, and he died in a workhouse. His mother ran boarding houses in Babbacombe and in Torwood, Torquay, and later lived with her unmarried sister, Mabel, an art teacher, who had advertised herself as giving sketching classes and preparing pupils for the South Kensington examinations.<br>
<br>Crosby attended Christ's Hospital preparatory school, Hertford, from 1896 to 1898, when he entered Christ's Hospital senior school in London. He left school in 1900 and was for a while an apprentice marine engineer, before working as a draughtsman in the drawing offices at the Vauxhall and Daimler companies in Coventry while living with Arthur Ludlow Clayden, the son of the principal of the Albert Memorial College in Exeter. In 1907 he joined the periodical <span class="italic">Autocar</span>, which was then based in Coventry, and with which he began an association as a salaried staff member which lasted over thirty years. He married in Coventry, on 23 July 1910, Gertrude Marjorie Dickinson (<i>b</i>. 1890), whose actual name was Florence Gertrude Dickinson, the daughter of John Dickinson, watch finisher, of Coventry. They had two sons, Peter and Michael, born in 1914 and 1921.<br>
<br>Although Crosby had no formal art training he contributed line drawings of mechanical parts of cars on show at Olympia to <span class="italic">Autocar</span> in November 1907 and illustrated a short story for its Christmas issue. Through 1908 he produced a steady stream of sketches of races and drivers that from the outset showed his capacity to capture movement and expressions. His full-page illustration (4 July 1908) of a hill climb on the Kirkstone Pass was the first of many that demonstrated his love and use of the landscape, either illustrating the dangers of the mountain road or the pleasures of driving along the open road.<br>
<br>Although Crosby's work was used in advertising campaigns he was not a commercial artist. His illustrations of races and cars on the open road proved popular, the first being his 1911 impression of the Coupe des Voiturettes L&eacute;g&egrave;res, which was used in the 1912 Rudge-Whitworth detachable wire wheels campaign. Illustrating topical subjects on design and safety, he made humour a common feature. His intention was to make the technology accessible to the layman, for example through his drawings of workshops in a series on &#145;How Cars are Produced&#146; and most significantly, in 1912, a full-page three-dimensional perspective drawing of a Lanchester chassis. His annotated technical perspective sketch of a Fergus chassis, in 1915, applied an aesthetic interpretation to motor engineering.<br>
<br>During the First World War Crosby provided patriotic illustrations of aircraft, convoys, and battle incidents for <span class="italic">Autocar</span> and for government departments. These produced one of only three exhibits by him at the Royal Academy, and his only critical success, <span class="italic">The Glorious Achievement of Lieut. Warneford VC, 7 July 1915</span> (exh. RA 1916), depicting the first destruction of a Zeppelin airship in air-to-air combat.<br>
<br>Crosby's drawings and paintings of the 3 litre Bentley for its 1919 catalogue illustrate the high quality of his design work not just as a graphic artist but as a concept artist. The car was not yet in production and it was left to Crosby's visual interpretation to authenticate the speed and power of the new machine. In July 1921 he wrote three illustrated articles for <span class="italic">Autocar</span>, &#145;The harmony of outline&#146;, followed in 1922 with &#145;All-weather cars&#146; and &#145;The design of sporting cars&#146;, and in 1925 &#145;Comfort and convenience in bodywork&#146;.<br>
<br>In April 1926 <span class="italic">Autocar</span> announced a series of graphic impressions of famous racing cars, prepared from paintings by Gordon Crosby. These colour prints secured his reputation as a motoring artist. They began with <span class="italic">Speed</span> (7 May 1926), depicting an &#145;ultra-modern&#146; racing car in British colours in the Le Mans. The series &#145;Meteors of the Road and Track&#146; began (25 June 1926) with a representation of Henri Fournier in a 60 hp Mors winning the 1901 Paris&#150;Berlin race. History paintings that made use of his knowledge of locations, informed by photographs and sketches, were published monthly through to September 1927, and then spasmodically between February 1928 and April 1929 when a colour print was included as part of an account of the 1922 grand prix along with his sketch of the original race. A new series of &#145;Meteors of the Road&#146; was launched in May 1938.<br>
<br>The only discussion of Crosby's work from an art criticism point of view was an evaluation in the context of advertising published in 1926 in the journal <span class="italic">Commercial Art</span>. He was applauded for capturing cars as living things, which was seen as an outcome of his intimate knowledge of motor engineering combined with a rare artistic skill, though it was his commercial value as an automobile artist, rather than his qualities as an illustrator, that was flagged up.<br>
<br>Crosby's annual excursions with the <span class="italic">Autocar</span> technical editor Montague Tombs to the London motor show from 1928 provided an invaluable discourse on the car aesthetic in the <span class="italic">Autocar</span> articles &#145;Keeping up appearances&#146;. His work was much used in advertising MG sports cars. Crosby's works were exhibited at the Rootes Showrooms, Devonshire House, London, in January 1929; the Olympia motor show, in 1930; the <i>Autocar</i> Picture Gallery, Olympia, in 1931; Ackermann's Gallery, New Bond Street, in 1934; and as part of the Selfridge's Safety Week Exhibition that toured between Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham in 1935. He worked at speed, to press deadlines, working in pen, pencil, charcoal, pastel, watercolour, and oil. He failed, however, to achieve the artistic recognition for which he yearned. His small scale bronzes fall into the decorative art category as trophies and mascots, as does his 1934 bronze plaque commissioned by the British Racing Drivers' Club to the memory of Sir Henry Birkin for the Brooklands Paddock.<br>
<br>A reproduction of a coloured painting by Crosby of a Hurricane fighter plane in aerial combat, produced for <span class="italic">Flight</span> magazine and titled <span class="italic">In a World of Space</span>, was chosen by King George VI for his Christmas cards to the RAF in December 1939, and was sold in aid of RAF charities. Generally known as F. Gordon Crosby, he latterly hyphenated his name. Having suffered for some time from pernicious anaemia, he committed suicide at his home, Heatherlands, South Drive, Wentworth, Virginia Water, Surrey, on 21 August 1943, dying from a gunshot wound to the head. A revival of interest in his work was triggered by an exhibition in 1978 and sales in 1990 and 1991.<br>
