<span class="headword">Lucas,  Charles Thomas</span>  (1820&#150;1895), <span class="occ">public works contractor</span>, was born on 26 October 1820 in Greenland Place, Cromer Street, St Pancras, London, the second son and fourth child of James Jonathan Hughes Lucas, a plasterer, said to be of Norfolk and Quaker descent, but born and baptized in the City of London, and his wife, Elizabeth Pearman. After serving articles with Stokes, a London builder, Lucas joined his father; he was soon employed by Samuel Morton Peto (1809&#150;1889) to superintend construction of the Norwich and Brandon Railway. In 1842 he set up his own contracting business in Norwich, where he was joined by his younger brother <a href="#cosubject_49440">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a> in founding Lucas Brothers at Lowestoft; they were extensively involved in the development of the town, the construction of waterworks, and the rebuilding of nearby country houses, including Somerleyton for Peto from 1844, Henham, and Rendlesham. The brothers moved in 1850 to London, where they secured riverside premises at Belvedere Road in Lambeth, aiming from the outset &#145;to become one of the first firms in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 17 Nov 1860, 757). In 1849 they had leased Peto's Somerleyton brickworks; the railway made off-site production profitable, and these became the focus of works that produced the vast quantities of building materials required for their undertakings. In the later 1850s they appeared frequently in <span class="italic">The Builder</span>'s lists of competitive tenders, but as unsuccessful, suggesting both that they had become one of the &#145;inevitable&#146; major contractors, and that their amount of work in hand made it generally unnecessary to quote very low prices.<br>
<br>This picture is confirmed by Lucas's statement, at a dinner to his workmen in the volunteer corps (of which he was a lieutenant-colonel) given in 1860, that they had had the same number of men in their employ &#145;upwards of ten years, and who had never yet had to work an hour's short time&#146;. They had &#145;felt it their duty at times to take works at a loss in order to keep their old hands on&#146;, but none the less their overall profit had been beyond anything they could have anticipated  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 17 Nov 1860, 757). Indeed, the firm obtained a commanding position in the construction of railway termini and vast hotels. Major works included Covent Garden Opera House and Floral Hall (1858, 1860), stations and hotels at Charing Cross, Cannon Street, Liverpool Street (1863&#150;4, 1867, and 1874), and York (1877&#150;8), and other leading hotels in London including the Palace (1860&#150;61), London Bridge (1861, at a cost of &pound;110,000), the Langham (1864, at a cost of &pound;300,000), and De Keyser's (1874). They also built King's College Hospital (1862), the Junior Carlton Club, Pall Mall (1866), the Royal Albert Hall (1867), and Charterhouse School (1872). The country houses they built included Cliveden for Lord Westminster and Normanhurst for Lord Brassey. They undertook in partnership with Kelk the huge building (largely intended to be temporary) at South Kensington to house the 1862 International Exhibition, a &pound;300,000 job. The South Kensington exhibitions of 1867 and 1871 were also their construction. Works for the war department included the reconstruction of Woolwich arsenal and Colchester camp, and contracts at Aldershot and Shorncliffe. In 1861, when they were building the new Blackfriars Bridge, Lucas Brothers were employing about 3000 men.<br>
<br>In the 1860s the brothers turned to railway contracting on their own account, though often in collaboration with other firms. Kelk and Lucas were contractors for the Metropolitan District Railway, and Lucas joined Brassey and Wythes in the East London Railway, tunnelled under the Thames. Their main railway work for the Great Eastern Railway was in 1865&#150;75. They also worked on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, and the West Highland. In 1870 they took John Aird into partnership, forming two new companies, Lucas and Aird, &#145;one of the largest employers of labour in the country&#146;, and John Aird &amp; Sons, to specialize in railway and commercial contracting. &#145;Heavily engaged in all directions on railways, dock and harbour construction, and gas- and water-works, &hellip; besides work for most of the principal railway companies&#146;  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 149, 1902) they built the Royal Albert and the rival Tilbury docks (1880, 1882&#150;6), and undertook the Suakin&#150;Berber Railway in the Sudan in 1885.<br>
<br>Lucas married Charlotte Emma, daughter of Charles Tiffin, on 27 April 1842; they had five sons and two daughters. In London he lived at 9 Belgrave Square. Of kindly manner and homely appearance, he nevertheless had a reputation for strength of will and the exercise of great authority, and for utter integrity in his business life. He acquired a country seat at Warnham Court near Horsham, Sussex, and became the complete squire, making large additions to the estate, restoring the church, laying out gardens, and rearing horses, sheep, and cattle, &#145;his various herds being well known in the agricultural world&#146;  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 144, 1896, 438). &#145;A generous landlord and a popular county man&#146;  (ibid.), he was a JP, and high sheriff, and also a deputy lieutenant for Sussex. He was a Conservative and was consulted by ministers on labour questions, but declined offers of an unopposed return to parliament because of his business commitments. His wife predeceased him; he provided for three of his younger sons in brewery businesses and left his Sussex estates to his eldest son, with the bulk of his personal property, for the upkeep of Warnham Court, expressing the wish that the estate should descend in the male line. He retired from business about 1891 and died of old age at Warnham Court on 4 December 1895.<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_49440"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Lucas</span>, first baronet  (1822&#150;1902), <span class="occ">public works contractor</span>, was born on 18 July 1822, also in Greenland Place, Cromer Street, St Pancras, London, the third son and fifth child of James and Elizabeth Lucas. About 1844 he joined Charles in establishing Lucas Brothers. Active like his brother in the volunteers, Thomas gave evidence to a War Office committee on the question of reserves and terms of service. In a trifling railway accident he received a blow on the knee that affected him for forty years and ultimately made him a confirmed invalid, leading a retired life. He was keenly interested in politics and a member of the Carlton Club, and was closely concerned with Viscount Cross's schemes for artisans' dwellings. He received a baronetcy from Salisbury's government in 1887, possibly inspired by his building Princess Alexandra's house for female students, South Kensington, at cost.<br>
<br>Thomas Lucas was twice married, first, in 1845, to Jane Rolfe (<i>d</i>. 1849), daughter of Charles Golder, with whom he had one daughter; and second, on 2 June 1852, to Mary Amelia, daughter of Robert Chamberlain of Catton House, Norfolk, with whom he had six sons and four daughters. His principal recreation was the opera. He collected paintings and <i>objets d'art</i> in his mansion at 12A Kensington Palace Gardens, where in 1871 his family was supported by a large resident staff of governess, eight female, and five male servants. He was socially aspirant and was described in the 1871 census as a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for Middlesex. He purchased Ashtead House, Surrey, in 1880 but sold it in 1888, although retaining the advowson; instead, Heatherwood, Ascot, Berkshire, became his summer residence. He commonly wintered at Cannes, and was closely involved in establishing St George's Anglican Church there.<br>
<br>Much richer (and better-looking) than his brother, Sir Thomas Lucas at his death left an estate valued at &pound;775,984; he possessed, in addition to shares in Lloyds Bank, mines and mining companies and the Hull, Barnsley, and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company, real estate in Norfolk, Suffolk, Middlesex, Surrey, Berkshire, and elsewhere, which he instructed in his will should be sold. He died on 6 March 1902 at 12A Kensington Palace Gardens, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
