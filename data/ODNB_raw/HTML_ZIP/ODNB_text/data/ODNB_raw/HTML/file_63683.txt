<span class="headword">Steel,  Dorothy Dyne</span>  (1884&#150;1965), <span class="occ">croquet player</span>, was born on 21 April 1884 at Woodsetts, Yorkshire, the daughter of Henry Allen Steel, vicar of Woodsetts, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roughton. She learned to play croquet on the vicarage lawn and developed an unexciting but highly effective style. Always known by her initials, D. D., she gave an indication of her potential by coming runner-up in the British women's championship in 1914. She won the title in 1919 and again in 1922, and in a remarkable sequence of victories triumphed thirteen times in fifteen years, 1925&#150;39, missing only 1928 and 1931, when the championship was won by Mrs R. C. J. Beaton and Mrs A. C. Ionides, respectively.<br>
<br>Between the wars Steel also won four open championships (1925, 1933, 1935, 1936), five open doubles titles (1924, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931), six mixed doubles titles (1923, 1932, 1934&#150;6, 1939), and the variously named President's cup six times (1922, 1923, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1937). The victories in the President's cup and in the open championship established Steel as the equal of any of the male players of the day, and the &#145;supreme woman croquet player of all time&#146;  (Arlott, 993).<br>
<br>Steel represented England three times in MacRobertson shield matches against Australia. She helped the home side to a comfortable win over the visitors at the Roehampton club in June 1925 and was considered a vital member of the side chosen for the return match in Australia in 1927. She nevertheless refused to travel unless her expenses were paid, compelling the council of the Croquet Association to relax its strict rules on professionalism. The official fund could not, however, meet the costs and the impasse was broken only by the intervention of a generous benefactor, Sir Francis Colchester-Wemyss, a passionate supporter of the game and a future president of the Croquet Association. Steel aroused great interest in Australia but did not enjoy the best of tours: she suffered from the heat and lost two games that, had she won them, would have retained the shield for England. She played better in the 1937 test series in England and was picked for the team nominated to tour New Zealand in 1939&#150;40, but this was cancelled because of the war. After 1945 Steel was increasingly afflicted by arthritis in her hands, and her victory in the mixed doubles in 1947 was her last major title. As her playing career came to an end she took to tournament management and proved no less dominant off the court than on.<br>
<br>Steel played with an upright style and a sideways stance, holding the mallet with an extremely tight grip. But she appeared to take no effort in the execution of her strokes and her intense concentration lent a perfectly even rhythm to her play: &#145;She trod the lawn with a springy step on the balls of her feet as the queen of the game which she knew herself to be; resolute, even a little grim, but the mistress of her art&#146;  (Prichard, 91). Some thought Steel a dull player, but she enjoyed her dominance and was famously competitive; her self-belief communicated itself to her opponents, who were never permitted to believe that they could win. Maurice B. Reckitt, a contemporary player, thought her &#145;probably the most infallible &#147;machine for victory&#148; in the history of the game&#146;  (Smith, 48). Steel presented a strait-laced image, with a mackintosh &#145;tightly belted around her plump waist&#146;, a &#145;squashed trilby hat&#146;, and steel-rimmed spectacles  (ibid.). The overall effect was one of determination&#151;her nickname was Stainless Steel&#151;and Edward Ward Petley, who twice partnered her in mixed doubles victories, recalled of their games together: &#145;She told me exactly what to do and I did it&#146;  (ibid., 33).<br>
<br>Steel spent much of her life at Biddenham, Bedfordshire, where she played for the Bedford club. She was a good horsewoman and a keen hunter in the winter months. She died on 22 January 1965 at her home, Kings Close, Main Road, Biddenham, Cardington, Bedfordshire. The following year the Steel memorial bowl was instituted in British croquet, to be awarded annually to the most improved woman player of the year. Steel lived with her unmarried sister Evelyn, herself an able croquet player. It was generally supposed that the two women were not well off; it came as a surprise, therefore, when Evelyn left &pound;120,000 on her death in 1974.<br>
