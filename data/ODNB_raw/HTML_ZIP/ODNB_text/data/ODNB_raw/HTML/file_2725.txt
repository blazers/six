<span class="headword">Blyth,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Zoophilus, Z]</span>  (1810&#150;1873), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 23 December 1810 at 9 Ironmongers Lane, City of London, the son of Clare Blyth (1749&#150;1821) from Norfolk, clothier, and his second wife, Catharine Saunders. After his father's death he was educated at Robert Fennel's gentlemen's boarding-school in Wimbledon, Surrey. His industry and prodigious memory were remarkable, as was his inclination to truancy to pursue natural history. He was originally intended for the church but Fennel suggested that he study chemistry, so he was apprenticed to Mr Thomas Keating, druggist, of Keating &amp; Co., 79 St Paul's Churchyard, City of London. He bought a druggist's business in Lower Tooting, London, around 1832 but neglected it, which led to its failure in 1837.<br>
<br>From a young age Blyth devoted himself to zoology, and became a leading ornithologist. He published several hundred natural history contributions and conducted a voluminous correspondence with fellow naturalists throughout his adult life. His early, mainly ornithological, work appeared in Rennie's <span class="italic">Field Naturalist</span>, Loudon's <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span> (later <span class="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</span>), Wood's <span class="italic">The Naturalist</span> and <span class="italic">The Analyst</span>, and the proceedings of the Ornithological and Zoological societies of London. He published an edition of White's <span class="italic">Natural History of Selborne</span> (1836). He moved to Brixton, Surrey, by May 1837, and, though unsuccessful in seeking employment in the British Museum, in 1838 he was appointed curator (possibly honorary) of the Ornithological Society of London's new museum.<br>
<br>In 1840 Blyth edited and enlarged the mammals, birds, and reptiles sections for a single-volume English edition of Cuvier's <span class="italic">Regne animal</span>, further establishing his scientific credentials, and marking his interest in larger mammals, including sheep, hyenas, and horses, on which he wrote lengthy papers. In 1841 he was recruited by Horace Hayman Wilson, librarian of the India House Museum, as the curator of the Asiatic Society of Bengal's museum. He arrived in Calcutta in September 1841, and remained curator effectively until 1862. During his curatorship he greatly increased the range and volume of the museum's natural history collections by establishing an extensive network of correspondents and donors, including hunters, travellers, foreign curators, and local animal enthusiasts. The society's collection was purchased by the crown in 1865, and formed the national Indian Museum.<br>
<br>Blyth's contribution to Asiatic zoology was substantial. Around 140 items, including monographs (on ungulates, birds, felines, primates, and others), notes, and curatorial reports, appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society</span>. He also encouraged and advised the work of field collectors such as Brian Houghton Hodgson, Allan Octavian Hume, Thomas Caverhill Jerdon, and Arthur Purves Phayre. His failures as a curator stemmed partly from his difficult personality, which caused conflict with society members and senior officials. Although generous and unfailingly helpful to all who sought assistance, he tended to underrate field naturalists (treating their claims to priority carelessly), resented authority, and relied overmuch on the patronage of the nobility. In 1847 he was severely censured by the Asiatic Society and denied a long-sought pay rise. Despite this stringent criticism (partly resulting from past conflicts and prejudice against his lack of formal qualifications), he retained his position. Some of the museum's problems were caused less by incompetence than by a severely limited establishment. He supplemented an inadequate salary with live-animal dealing and writing pseudonymously for the <span class="italic">Indian Sporting Review</span> (later the <span class="italic">Indian Field</span>) and the <span class="italic">Calcutta Review</span>.<br>
<br>Blyth married Elizabeth Mary Turner Hodges (1825&#150;1857), widow, and daughter of James Sutton, on 20 February 1854. The shock of her sudden death from hepatitis in December 1857 caused Blyth's near-fatal physical collapse. Despite restorative field trips to Burma, this led eventually to his departure from Calcutta in November 1862 and retirement finally in 1863, on a belatedly awarded pension of &pound;150. From at least 1865 until the end of his life he suffered recurring ill health, of possibly psychological origin, sometimes with mania and paranoid tendencies, and exacerbated by alcohol abuse. In 1866 he was briefly placed in an asylum. Nevertheless, he continued to write prolifically, usually as Zoophilus or Z. Lengthy pieces on domesticated animals (mostly based on previously published work), correspondence, and an anonymous column on new arrivals at London Zoo appeared in <span class="italic">Land &amp; Water</span> (1866&#150;9). Numerous notes, letters, and articles, including a series of papers on the animals of Burma and a monograph on cranes, appeared in <span class="italic">The Field</span> (1869&#150;73). He also published in <span class="italic">The Ibis</span>.<br>
<br>From 1855 Blyth was one of Charles Darwin's most indefatigable correspondents and a major source of information on domestication and sexual differences in birds and animals. Mistakenly identified by Eiseley as the inspiration for Darwin's theory of natural selection, he was actually a conservative zoologist, unusually interested in locality and ecology. His attention to detail and encyclopaedic knowledge gave his work continuing value but often delayed his papers, to the frustration of his employers and the regret of his obituarists. He became an enthusiastic Darwinist after the publication of <span class="italic">On the Origin of Species</span> (1859).<br>
<br>In 1872 Blyth again became ill, probably with the heart disease from which he died on 27 December 1873, at his sister's residence, 11 Regent's Park Terrace, London. He was buried at St James's cemetery, Highgate, on 2 January 1874. His <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Mammals and Birds of Burma</span> was published posthumously in 1875.<br>
