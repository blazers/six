<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Mary</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1617/18), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was one of the four daughters and two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70802/', "Sir Humphrey Radcliffe")</script> of Elstow, Bedfordshire (1508/9&#150;1566), and his wife, Isabella, daughter of Edmund Harvey and his wife, Margaret Wentworth. She may have been only semi-literate, for she signed her will with a mark. By 1564, when she was probably in her mid-teens, she was a maid of honour&#151;the story goes that her father, attending the court at the end of 1560, offered his daughter to Queen Elizabeth as his new year's present. Mary's subsequent career in the privy chamber has a number of unusual aspects, best explained by the queen's fondness for her. Maids of honour were normally funded by their families, but Elizabeth paid her the comparatively generous stipend of &pound;40 a year; in 1569 two and a half years' arrears were paid out of the privy purse. She was still a maid in 1574, but had become an unwaged gentlewoman by July 1587, when &#145;A book of such jewels and other parcels delivered to the charge and custody of Mrs Ratcliffe one of the gentlewomen of the queen's majesties privy chamber as were parcel of the jewels as were in the charge of Mrs Blanche Parry&#146; was drawn up  (BL, Royal MSS, appx 68). She only entered into wages on 31 December 1589. Despite hints of a romance in the early 1570s she never married; she and Blanche Parry were the only waged women of the privy chamber to share the queen's virginity. Unlike many other gentlewomen, Mary Radcliffe has left no evidence of involvement in patronage; all that survives is a few friendly references in the Manners family correspondence. In 1599 it was rumoured she would retire and be replaced by Elizabeth Southwell, but she was still in post on the queen's death and attended her funeral. The jewels in her custody had been surrendered to the keeper of the wardrobe during the survey of the wardrobe of the robes in July 1600, but they were returned to her on 28 May 1603, possibly as the result of a verbal bequest by Elizabeth (who did not leave a will).<br>
<br>Mary Radcliffe drew up her own will on 5 November 1617. It shows that by then she was living in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, and that she had at least two servants, to whom she made bequests. It also records her pride in her court employment. Describing herself as &#145;sometimes one of the gentlewomen of her late Maiesties honourable privie Chaumber&#146;, she requested burial in the parish church of whatever place she died in, along with the distribution of &pound;20 among the local poor, and the erection there of &#145;a comelie and convenient Monument in Stone shewing bothe the race and birthe whereof I am discended and allso the Roome and place wherein I lyved and served her saied late Maiestie&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/132, fols. 75<i>v</i>&#150;76<i>r</i>). Several of her bequests took the form of silver plate, for instance those to her nieces Mary Spencer and Elizabeth Molle, but she left an annuity of &pound;5 to her nephew Radcliffe Gostwick, the son of her sister Martha, while her brother Sir Edward Radcliffe (<i>d</i>. 1643), later sixth earl of Sussex, received an annuity of &pound;50. Her nephew Sir Thomas Cheke, the son of her sister Frances, was named as her residuary legatee, and also as her executor. Mary Radcliffe had died by 18 July 1618, when her will was proved. She is not recorded as having been buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields; if she was commemorated there, her monument would have disappeared when the existing church was built in the eighteenth century.<br>
