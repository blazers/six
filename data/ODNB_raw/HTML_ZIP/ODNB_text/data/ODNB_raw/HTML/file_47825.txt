<span class="headword">Robinson,  David</span>  (1787&#150;1849), <span class="occ">journalist and economist</span>, was born at Garton on the Wolds in the East Riding of Yorkshire on 22 July 1787, the son of George Robinson and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor. He spent his adult life in London. He was educated for a career in business, but began to write occasionally in local newspapers. From 1821, by what he later described as an &#145;accident&#146;, writing became his sole employment for the next fifteen years. All his work was published anonymously or pseudonymously, and half of it at most can be identified.<br>
<br>From 1821 to 1823 Robinson wrote for John Stoddart's <span class="italic">New Times</span>, a government-supported high-tory London daily. Already in his mid-thirties, he hoped to write for the prestigious <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, but his first article there was also the last. It appeared in the fifty-fifth issue (dated October 1822 but published in February 1823), heavily revised by the editor, William Gifford, who declined further articles. Lowering his sights slightly, in January 1824 Robinson moved to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, a monthly, where he stayed for eight years. His first article, &#145;Letter from Sampson Standfast, Esq. to Christopher North [the putative editor]&#146;, showed that he had already mastered the slashing style of <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, which he even employed in verse. A four-page, double-columned poem, &#145;New Lights&#146; (<span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, 17, June 1825, 732&#150;5), was an eighteenth-century political satire put into an intricate stanzaic form, probably Robinson's invention, at odds with the poem's content. Usually he chose prose, which John Stuart Mill (writing in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> on another &#145;Letter to Christopher North&#146; by Robinson) described as &#145;the raving of a party politician&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newspaper Writings by John Stuart Mill</span>, ed. A. Robson and J. M. Robson, <span class="italic">Collected Works of John Stuart Mill</span>, vol. 22, 1986, 229).<br>
<br>Robinson had ninety-two articles published in <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> up to 1831. He left them unsigned or used changing signatures: &#145;Y. Y. Y.&#146;, &#145;One of the Old School&#146;, &#145;One of the Democracy&#146;, &#145;An English Freeholder&#146;, &#145;A Bystander&#146;. Concerned that &#145;the Liberals are cut-throats when they can lay hold of a name&#146;  (Rashid, 269), he went to great lengths to preserve his anonymity. He thus obscured the fact that he was not a freelancer offering work to any editor who would accept it but a staff member, in fact <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> political authority. His most significant contributions were his pungent criticisms of Ricardian economists and of the economic policies of the liberal tory governments. He defended the corn laws and the poor law, while advocating cheap paper money as a solution to under-consumption. His attacks on free trade and bullionism were part of a larger critique, which challenged both the intellectual underpinnings and the practical effects of market reforms on the social order. He has been described as &#145;the most brilliant&#146; of the school of <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> protectionist and paternalist defenders of the old social order  (Perkin, 248).<br>
<br>Robinson's connection with <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> ended in 1831, after some sort of rupture with William Blackwood. He moved to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, a London monthly then similar to <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> in politics and spirit. He claimed to have contributed to <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> for four years; his articles, he estimated, totalled 600 pages (though he often underestimated the extent of his work). Attributions of articles in <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> are uncertain, but in subject and style contributions by Robinson are identifiable from 1833 to 1837 on the established church in Ireland, and church establishments in general, which were seen to be under threat from the whig government and which became his principal theme.<br>
<br>From 1837 Robinson suffered from illness and no further published writings by him are known. After trying unsuccessfully to return to the commercial world he became financially reliant on the kindness of friends. He was married, and his elderly mother was also dependent on him. He moved lodgings frequently, and was forced to sell many of his books. In 1846 or 1847 he moved from Kensington to Pimlico, near the Charlotte Chapel, whose incumbent, James Kelly, an evangelical, anti-Tractarian Anglican, sought help on Robinson's behalf. An application to the Royal Literary Fund, in October 1847, was supported by Kelly, Martin Tupper, and Edwin Lankester, physician to the Royal Pimlico Dispensary. Despite the evidence of Robinson's literary productivity, his claim was rejected on the ground that he had not published a separate work. He probably suffered from being an outsider, detached from the literary community. In late 1848 Lankester and Kelly raised a subscription for him, asserting in a newspaper advertisement that his plight was &#145;not the result of indolence or intemperance&#146;  (Royal Literary Fund, case no. 1180).<br>
<br>Robinson moved, for the sake of his health, to Wickham, Hampshire, where he died of consumption on 19 February 1849. He was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Wickham, on 26 February. No stone identifies his resting place. An obituary, which bears the mark of Lankester and which was originally published in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, obliquely criticized the Royal Literary Fund for declining Robinson's application for support: he had been<blockquote>for many years a contributor to the leading magazines, his writings in which often displayed great power, and excited much attention. Mr. Robinson was, however, one of those victims with which the bye-places of literature abound, for want of some institution within the republic of letters itself on which the sick and the destitute might have a citizen's claim. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 31, 1849, 442)</blockquote>His wife and mother survived him; there had been no children. Robinson has received renewed attention since the identification in the mid-twentieth century of his articles in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>.<br>
