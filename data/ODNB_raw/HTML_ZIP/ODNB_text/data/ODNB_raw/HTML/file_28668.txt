<span class="headword">Wansey,  Henry</span>  (1751&#150;1827), <span class="occ">woollen manufacturer and traveller</span>, was born on 10 August 1751 at Warminster, Wiltshire, the sixth son among at least ten children of George Wansey (1713&#150;1762), clothier, and his wife, Esther Greene (1713&#150;1795). For two years he attended the Lord Weymouth Grammar School in Church Street, Warminster, simultaneously learning writing from an independent Warminster schoolmaster. Then from the age of eight until the age of fifteen he, like his three surviving elder brothers, was sent to the boarding-school at Frenchay, near Bristol, kept by the Revd Joshua Griffith, minister of the Presbyterian chapel there. He was prevented by his father's death in 1762 from attending one of the dissenting academies whose rationalist theology attracted both his father and later himself.<br>
<br>Wansey served a traditional clothier's apprenticeship, possibly in Salisbury, where he was an established clothier by 1773. He remained in Salisbury for over thirty years, becoming a prosperous and influential, if at times contentious, gentleman capitalist. Controversially, he was associated with the introduction of the spinning jenny into the city, apparently in 1791. He shared the woollen lobby's protectionist views and vigorously defended the old prohibition on the export of wool in his <span class="italic">Wool Encouraged without Exportation</span> (1791). Towards the end of his career and in retirement he joined the Bath and West of England Society and advocated various means of improving the quality of British wools: urging free- and wide-range shepherding techniques and campaigning for the improved Ryeland breed of sheep. As a Salisbury householder he joined the chorus of complaints against the rising costs of poor relief, publishing <span class="italic">Thoughts on Poor Houses</span> (1801).<br>
<br>On 14 June 1779 Wansey married Alice Abigail Gwynn (<i>d</i>. 1793), third child and second daughter of Captain Richard Gwynn RN (<i>d</i>. 1766), and his first wife, Elizabeth, of Upham, Hampshire. They had one daughter, Jane (1781&#150;1805). Beyond work and family, Wansey vented his convictions and passions in three directions: travel, the defence of religious liberty, and antiquarianism.<br>
<br>Wansey began indulging his taste for long-distance travel in 1794, the year after his wife died. He travelled to America in order to survey the American market for textiles and to discover the state of woollen manufacturing in the newly independent nation, possibly with a view to setting up a business himself. A prudent investment in American land likewise motivated him. He therefore bought two shares in the English settlement established on the Loyalsoc in western Pennsylvania by his co-religionist the Unitarian and scientist Dr Joseph Priestley. At the same time he purchased 1200 acres at Chest Creek on the west branch of the Susquehanna. In the new fashion of the day, he published an account of his American experiences, <span class="italic">The Journal of an Excursion to the United States of North America in the Summer of 1794</span> (1796), which was published in a German translation in 1797.<br>
<br>As an English Presbyterian, Wansey followed the denomination's dominant theological shifts, from Arianism to Socinianism. Privately he believed that a new translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> would resolve denominational differences. Although a Unitarian, he sprang to the defence of orthodox, and therefore Trinitarian, dissenters during the 1790s. His <span class="italic">Letter to the Bishop of Salisbury</span> (1798) stoutly upheld the right of dissenters to preach in the villages and, more widely, defended a universal right to freedom of private religious belief. In the 1820s he was embroiled in a controversy among Unitarians about missionary preaching.<br>
<br>After retiring to Warminster about 1805, Wansey's summers were spent either on his travels or riding over the Wiltshire downs on antiquarian pursuits, and his winters were passed in the pleasant society of Bath. In 1806 he made a tour of the eastern counties, indulging his passion for family and local history. In 1814 he travelled to Paris with his nephew George Wansey to see and record the condition of France after Napoleon's confinement to Elba, of which he published an account, <span class="italic">A Visit to Paris in June 1814</span> (1814).<br>
<br>From early adulthood Wansey was interested in medieval and Roman remains, particularly Farleigh Hungerford Castle. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1789, having made drawings of monuments in Salisbury Cathedral which were either rearranged or demolished during the restoration scheme of Bishop Shute Barrington and the architect James Wyatt. He also publicly speculated on the origins of Stonehenge. In retirement he joined the circle of antiquaries who helped Sir Richard Colt Hoare at Stourhead in compiling a history of Wiltshire. His contribution was posthumously published, jointly with Hoare, as <span class="italic">The Hundred of Warminister</span> in volume 3 (1831) of <span class="italic">The History of Modern Wiltshire</span> (1822&#150;44), edited by Sir Colt Hoare.<br>
<br>Wansey died of a paralytic seizure at his home, Byne House, Church Street, Warminster, on 19 July 1827 and was buried in the town's Boreham Road nonconformist cemetery, a burial-ground which he had largely financed. He left an estate which included liquid assets of over &pound;10,000.<br>
