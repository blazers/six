<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kemp,  George Meikle</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>John Morvo]</span>  (1795&#150;1844), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 26 May 1795, at Hillriggs Farm, near Biggar, Lanarkshire, the son of James Kemp, a shepherd, and his wife, Jean Mulberry or Mowbray (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1827), a family frequently on poor relief. Showing an early fondness for drawing, carving, and woodwork (he made furniture throughout his life), he was apprenticed as a carpenter to Andrew Noble of Redscaurhead (where his 1932 memorial was erected) before joining a millwright's shop in Galashiels in 1813 (part of his journey being a lift on Sir Walter Scott's coach). In 1815 he joined John Cousin, builder and joiner of Leith, as a journeyman carpenter, and he may periodically have returned to Cousin's firm whenever work was short elsewhere. In 1817 he moved to Lancashire, where he worked as a carpenter while studying Gothic architecture; he also practised as a carpenter in 1820 in Glasgow while attending evening classes. He moved to London in 1824, failed to find a permanent position, and travelled into France. Kemp considered emigrating to Canada, but returned to Scotland upon his mother's death. In 1827 he became a freemason of St Andrew's Lodge, Edinburgh. Probably through his brother Thomas, clerk of works to the duke of Buccleuch 1821&#150;40, he was employed by William Burn on drawings for Bowhill, Selkirk, perhaps as clerk of works; he also worked extensively with John Smith of Darnick. In 1831 he constructed a large wooden model of proposals for Dalkeith by William Burn. In 1832 he married Elizabeth (Betsy) Bonnar, daughter of an Edinburgh house painter and decorator.<br>
<br>After his views of Melrose were exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1830, Kemp was invited by a Mr Johnstone to prepare drawings for a proposed publication on &#145;Scottish cathedrals and antiquities&#146;. He was still working on this in 1838, but the project foundered thereafter. By 1836 there was confusion about Kemp's profession. The antiquarian Revd John Sime called him an &#145;architectural artist&#146;, whereas, when completing the West Church in Maybole that year, Kemp referred to himself as an architect. Wholly absorbed in the rediscovery and recreation of the glories of medieval Scotland, Kemp may be compared to an architectural Thomas Chatterton. He drew a proposed restoration of Melrose Abbey, and (unless this was the work of his son Thomas) of Roslin Chapel, Midlothian, and a relocation of Trinity College Church, Edinburgh. His largest project at the time was the restoration of Glasgow Cathedral for Archibald MacLellan; but his drawings were published and forwarded to the Treasury in 1836 without any credit. Kemp presented a set to James Skene of Rubislaw, each drawing annotated &#145;John Morvo Archt&#146; to underline his authorship. (Morvo was his pseudonym for his greatest work, the Scott monument commission.) Perhaps thinking that Kemp, however good an illustrator, had inadequate credibility as architect, MacLellan commissioned Gillespie Graham for new proposals. Mortified, Kemp exhibited drawings for the cathedral, with sketches for three original windows, and a model, with costs obtained from John Cousin in Edinburgh in 1838. In vain.<br>
<br>In 1836 Kemp was persuaded to enter the competition for a memorial in Edinburgh to Sir Walter Scott. For one of three premiated designs, he was awarded 50 guineas. The competition was rerun in 1838, and Kemp's design won for its &#145;strict conformity with the purity and style of Melrose Abbey&#146;  (Bonnar, 85). There was probably nobody in Scotland as familiar with Melrose Abbey as Kemp, and he won with a vertical and slender design which John Britton praised as a &#145;florid cenotaph&#146;  (Bonnar, 93). &#145;The whole building being composed of a substantial collection of buttresses and piers &hellip; a feature in which it is well known that the principal beauties as well as strength of gothic architecture resides&#146;, wrote Kemp, there were no walls at all  (Bonnar, 97). The monument&#151;perhaps the most striking commemoration of an individual in any British city&#151;dominates Princes Street and contrasts with the classicism of the nearby art galleries. There was fierce controversy. William Burn admired &#145;the purity of Gothic composition and more particularly the constructive style&#146;, but then attempted to persuade Kemp to accept &pound;100 and give the commission to him  (Bonnar, 98).<br>
<br>Kemp's family moved in 1837 from Stockbridge to &#145;the land of Canaan&#146;, Bloomberry Cottage, Canaan Lane, Morningside. Contemplating entering partnership with John Cousin's son David, he demurred once he had decided to undertake the additional role of supervisor of the building works of the monument at 2 guineas a week. He passed on to David Cousin the proposed &#145;cheap church&#146; that a Mr Blackie had offered him, and eventually sent his son Thomas to train with him. The foundation-stone of the Scott monument was laid on 15 August 1840. On 5 April 1843 Kemp was elected affiliate member, operative lodge journeyman, Edinburgh; but on 6 March 1844 he tumbled into the Union Canal at Fountainbridge, on his way home, and drowned. He was buried in St Cuthbert's churchyard, Edinburgh. At his death, it was thought he had achieved &#145;a prosperous position in business&#146;, but he died intestate, leaving assets of &pound;202 and the model of Glasgow Cathedral &#145;which has proved unsaleable&#146;. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Kemp was excellent company, a prolific poet, devoted to his family, and had good rapport with his workmen, who regarded him as a role model. He never appears to have made the full transition from joiner to architect that, say, had been achieved only recently by Archibald Elliot. He is reputed to have had a hand in the design of the spiky churches of Millburn Free, Renton (1843), and St John's Free, George Street, Glasgow, designed by J. T. Rochead. But, besides the Scott monument and West Church, Maybole, the only buildings reliably attributed to him are the south wing at Woodhouselee, Midlothian, for James Tytler, and perhaps Gothic Bank, Morningside, fees for both of which were still owing at his death.<br>
