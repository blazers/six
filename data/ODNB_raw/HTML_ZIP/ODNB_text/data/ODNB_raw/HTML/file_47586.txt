<span class="headword">Wyatt, Sir  Myles Dermot Norris</span>  (1903&#150;1968), <span class="occ">air transport entrepreneur</span>, was born on 2 July 1903, at West House, Hartford, near Northwich, Cheshire, the younger son of Arthur Norris Wyatt, master brewer, and his wife, May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reynolds.<br>
<br>Wyatt was educated at Radley College and New College, Oxford. In 1926 he joined the Port of Calcutta commissioners, working for the next eight years as assistant and deputy secretary. In 1934 he returned to Britain, and became general manager for Airwork Ltd. This company had been formed in 1928 by Nigel Norman and Alan Muntz to develop the airfield at Heston, in west London, as a centre for private flying. However, the number of private owners using the site grew only slowly, and Airwork diversified into aviation support services as well as opening a flying school. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Wyatt was a director of the firm.<br>
<br>During the war Airwork concentrated on training pilots for the Royal Air Force, and repairing combat aircraft. In 1945 Wyatt was the key figure in the company's management, and with the sale of Heston airport to the government, he and Muntz established Airwork as an independent airline. Initially this meant supplying charter services, since the Labour government had reserved scheduled flying to the new air corporations created by the 1946 <span class="roman">Civil Aviation Act</span>. In the following years, however, Airwork extended its range of operations, providing air trooping capacity for the government, flying colonial coach services to Commonwealth countries in Africa, and establishing a share of the new &#145;inclusive tour&#146; market.<br>
<br>In the course of its expansion Airwork acquired other smaller airlines, including Morton Air and Freddie Laker's Air Charter Ltd in 1958. It also received substantial investment from shipping interests like Furness Withy and the Blue Star Line. In 1960, encouraged by new legislation which relaxed the air corporations' monopoly of scheduled services, Wyatt's company merged with another shipping-backed independent airline, Hunting Clan Air Transport Ltd, to form British United Airways (BUA). In 1961 BUA became a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Holdings Ltd, with Wyatt as executive chairman, and Freddie Laker as his managing director. Laker later left BUA to follow his own career as an entrepreneur.<br>
<br>With further acquisitions, including Silver City Airways, which had pioneered car-ferry services between England and the continent, BUA became Britain's largest independent airline. In 1966 it took over scheduled services to Brazil, Argentina, and Chile from the state-owned British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), flying the new Vickers VC10 jet aircraft on the route. By the end of the decade BUA's network of services from Gatwick airport covered east and west Africa, the Canary Islands, and western Europe, as well as South America. Wyatt himself, who had been created CBE in 1954, was knighted in 1963.<br>
<br>Mindful of BUA's profitability, and of the large capital expenditure needed to fund the airline's investment in new aircraft, Wyatt entered into secret negotiations in 1966 to sell the company to BOAC. The proposal was vetoed by the government pending the report of the Edwards committee inquiry into British air transport. When this was released in 1969 it recommended the creation of a &#145;second force&#146; in competition with the air corporations, and BUA was eventually merged with Caledonian Airways to form British Caledonian Airways.<br>
<br>Besides being chairman of the Air Holdings Group, Wyatt was a director of several other companies, and a long-time officer of the British Independent Air Transport Association until BUA left the organization in 1964. He was outspoken in defending the interests of Britain's independent airlines, arguing that the government should allow them a greater share of the market for scheduled passenger traffic. He was also a keen yachtsman, becoming admiral of the Royal Ocean Yacht Club, and the owner of several famous cruising yachts.<br>
<br>Myles Wyatt married Dorothy O'Malley in 1929, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Sir Myles died at his home, Alresford Hall, Alresford, near Colchester, on 15 April 1968.<br>
