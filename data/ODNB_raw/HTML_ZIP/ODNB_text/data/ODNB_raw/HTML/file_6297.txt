<span class="headword">Corby <span class="st"> [Corbie]</span>,  Ambrose</span>  (1604&#150;1649), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was by his own account born in Yorkshire on 25 December 1604, the youngest of the four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6298/', "Gerard Corby or Corbie (1558&#150;1637)")</script> and his wife, Isabella Richardson (<i>d</i>. 1652). Both his parents were Catholic converts and future religious, while his two surviving brothers, Robert Corby and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6299/', "Ralph Corby,")</script> became Jesuits and his two surviving sisters Benedictine nuns. Educated first in Yorkshire, at the age of twelve he entered the English College at St Omer, where he studied humanities and was reported &#145;among the first rather than the last in class&#146;  (Kenny, 2.348). On 11 October 1622 he entered the English College, Rome, and received minor orders on 16 September 1625 before ill health caused him to return to join his father in the Low Countries. He was admitted into the Society of Jesus at Watten on 7 September 1627, and successively taught syntax, rhetoric, and grammar at St Omer from 1628. Ordained priest on 22 September 1633 he undertook his Jesuit theological studies at Li&egrave;ge and his tertianship at Ghent. He again taught humanities at St Omer before his profession of the four vows on 15 August 1641. Appointed minister at Ghent in 1644 he was sent to Rome the following year, where he served as confessor in the English College. He was the author of <span class="italic">Narratio gloriosa mortis &hellip; P. Henricus Mors</span> (1645), an account of the recently executed English Jesuit Henry Morse, and of <span class="italic">Certamen triplex</span> (1645), comprising accounts of Morse and his fellow Jesuits and fellow sufferers Thomas Holland and Corby's own brother Ralph. An English translation of the latter work was published in 1858. He also wrote a brief account of his father, subsequently published by Foley in 1877. He died in Rome on 11 April 1649.<br>
