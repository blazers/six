<span class="headword">Preyer,  Thierry William</span>  (1841&#150;1897), <span class="occ">physiologist and advocate of Darwinism</span>, was born on 4 July 1841 at Moss Side, Manchester, the son of Thierry Preyer, merchant, and his wife, Ad&egrave;le, formerly Kutter (or Kutten). Both parents were originally from Germany and had presumably come to Manchester in connection with the father's business.<br>
<br>Little direct information exists on Preyer's life; what family papers did exist were lost during the Second World War. The problem is compounded by the fact that Preyer's own autobiographical sketches contain false and contradictory information, reversing the order of his names to William Thierry, for example, and so leading a number of writers to believe that Thierry William was his father.<br>
<br>Preyer's education began at home under visiting teachers, native speakers of English and German. After a brief attendance at Clapham grammar school, Clapham, London, he and his family moved to Germany in 1855, settling in Wiesbaden, Prussia. He spent two and a half years at the <i>Gymnasium</i> in Duisburg, moved to Bonn where he passed his examinations in the autumn of 1859, and went on to study medicine and natural science at the university there. In the summer of 1860 he made a trip to Iceland, after which he moved to Berlin to prepare for a career in physiology. In the autumn of 1861 he moved to Heidelberg where, among other subjects, he studied chemistry with Bunsen, physiology with Helmholz, and zoology with Bronn. On 13 August 1862 he successfully completed his doctoral examination, submitting the first Darwinian thesis written in Germany. Shortly afterwards he went to Vienna to study physiology with Ludwig for a year, before returning to Berlin to work with Virchow and others. By 1864 he was in Paris studying with Bernard, and in the summer of 1865 he became a <i>Privatdozent</i> in zoochemistry and zoophysics at Bonn, where he was given a doctoral degree (and apparently his <i>Habilitation</i>) in medicine and surgery. Preyer's educational achievements permitted him in 1869 to accept a position as <i>ordinarius</i> professor of physiology in the faculty of medicine at Jena and director of the Physiological Institute.<br>
<br>Preyer is probably best known for his book, <span class="italic">Die Seele des Kindes</span> (1882), which was published in English as <span class="italic">The Mind of the Child</span> (1888). It is considered a seminal work in developmental psychology, although Preyer was not associated with the group of psychologists who established the modern discipline. In 1868 he initiated a correspondence with Darwin that continued until shortly before the latter's death. He was an avid Darwinist and protagonist for natural selection. He produced a popularized translation of <span class="italic">On the Origin of Species</span> and a biography of his idol, <span class="italic">Darwin, sein Leben und Wirken</span> (1896); in 1891 he published copies of much of his correspondence with Darwin. At Jena he numbered among his friends William Roux, one of the founders of experimental embryology, and E. Ray Lankester, later one of the giants of late nineteenth-century British biology; the older Ernst Haekel apparently was not as close a friend as the younger men.<br>
<br>From a British standpoint, Preyer's greatest significance is his role in popularizing Darwinism in Germany, particularly as one of the few who accepted the ideas in a relatively unqualified form. Most other German proponents of Darwin and British biology used the theses in the furtherance of their own arguments; Haekel, for example, adapted Darwin to the service of his own monistic metaphysics. For Preyer, all his efforts were designed to gather diverse data to support the theory as proposed and demonstrated by the British interpretations. In this particular he stands out from his better-known contemporaries.<br>
<br>In 1888 Preyer resigned the professorship, apparently as a result of personal problems, and moved to Berlin where he lectured as a <i>Privatdozent</i> until 1893 when he moved to Wiesbaden where he died after a lengthy illness on 15 July 1897. He was survived by his wife, Erika, and at least one son, Axel Thierry Preyer, who obtained his doctorate at the University of Leipzig on 20 November 1899 with a dissertation in zoology.<br>
