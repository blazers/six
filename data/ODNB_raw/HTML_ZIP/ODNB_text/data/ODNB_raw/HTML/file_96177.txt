<span class="headword">Storey,  Graham</span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 8 November 1920 at North Ferriby in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the elder son of Stanley Runton Storey, dental surgeon, and his wife, Winifred Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graham. His parents had considerable means from both Winifred and the family firm of wine merchants, Asher-Storey. The family early moved to Manting House, Meldreth, Cambridgeshire, and the expectations of his parents focused on Storey &#145;in a way that he sometimes found oppressive&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). He was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, and then entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge. His undergraduate career was foreshortened by the Second World War, but he took firsts in law and English. He served in the Royal Artillery from 1941 to 1945, was mentioned in dispatches, and formed a close friendship with Robert Runcie, the future archbishop of Canterbury; he was Runcie's best man and later his colleague, when Runcie was dean at Trinity Hall. Storey was demobilized with the rank of lieutenant.<br>
<br>Called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1950, though he never practised, Storey was for some time undecided between law and English. Offered fellowships in Cambridge in law (at Gonville and Caius College) and English (at Trinity Hall), he determined on English. He was a fellow of Trinity Hall from 1949 to 1988, and very much a college man, serving as senior tutor (1958&#150;68) and vice-master (1970&#150;74). He was also a university lecturer (1965&#150;81) and reader (1981&#150;8) in English. His wider commitment to English and the university was demonstrated in his two years as chairman of the faculty board of English (1972&#150;4), at that time, more even than usual, a poisoned chalice, with Cambridge English &#145;riven with personal animosities and fierce ideological disputes&#146;; but Storey, &#145;whom no one considered a threat, thanks to his modest and polite demeanour&#146;, steered through reforms acceptable to all parties  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>).<br>
<br>Storey's first publication came about through a lifetime friendship with John Chancellor, writer and antiquarian book dealer: he was invited by Chancellor's father, Sir Christopher Chancellor, chairman of Reuters, to write the firm's history to mark its centenary  (<span class="italic">Reuters' Century</span>, 1951). Subsequent publications were founded in taking up other men's work and pursuing them successfully to publication. He completed Humphry House's edition of the <span class="italic">Journals and Papers of Gerard Manley Hopkins</span> (1959), following House's premature death in 1955, and edited A. P. Rossiter's Shakespeare essays, <span class="italic">Angel with Horns</span> (1961). His lasting affection for Hopkins and Renaissance drama was demonstrated in his <span class="italic">Preface to Hopkins</span> (1981) and in his general editorship of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Renaissance and Restoration Dramatists</span> (1975&#150;89). It was also through Humphry House that Storey came to his sterling academic achievement. He had had &#145;digs&#146; with Humphry and Madeline House in Cambridge after war service and Madeline's confidence in him led to the Hopkins <span class="italic">Journals</span> and to an invitation to complete House's work on Dickens. In 1949 House had begun work on a complete and thoroughly annotated edition of Dickens's letters and drew many enthusiasts and academics into the enterprise: much had been done before his death to collect and annotate letters. After his death Madeline House felt that Storey &#145;was the man&#146; and in 1957 invited him to join her as general editor. Kathleen Tillotson joined as a general editor a little later and others were brought in as co-editors for individual volumes. Yet overall, more especially in the later volumes, Storey produced the bulk of the annotation and, while he could be hasty, feeling towards the end no doubt the need to see the work through, the completed twelve volumes (1965&#150;2002) stand as tribute to his accuracy, determination, and assiduity.<br>
<br>After his mother's death Storey acquired Crown House, Ermine Street, Caxton, Cambridgeshire, an old coaching inn, a rambling and dark building, far from warm in winter. Here was the archive room of the Dickens edition, its walls lined with works of reference (notably the <span class="italic">DNB</span>) and box upon box of photocopies, notes, and correspondence; here also, being a good cook, Storey gave a celebratory dinner on the publication of each volume of the letters for the immediate collaborators. The garden was long, with a pond (into which were blown, on at least one occasion, notes of a co-editor), and the venue for Storey's annual summer party, with a string quartet, for students and colleagues.<br>
<br>Both colleagues and students appreciated Storey's care, tact, and generosity. If for him literature was something that disturbed, touching the &#145;primal&#146; or &#145;archetypal terror&#146;, students found him ready to help and support them personally as well as academically, and he would delight in driving a group to Stratford to see a play, give them dinner, and return them that night. In committees he was well prepared and alert, so that business went without hitch. He was in many ways a shy man, who did not find it easy to relax in company, despite his delight in people and occasions, and was often self-effacing, even at events he had organized. His manner, particularly on the phone, could be abrupt, until callers learned how to fit their own rhythms to his. A homosexual, he kept his personal life largely separate and apparently believed that his sexuality was concealed from others, whereas in fact it was generally known and simply accepted. In his last years, he became increasingly physically and mentally frail and died of multiple causes on 6 November 2005 at the Hope Residential and Nursing Care Home, Brooklands Avenue, Cambridge. He was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Meldreth, Cambridgeshire, on 14 November. He had already munificently funded the conversion of the old college library into a public reception room, named in his honour and opened by the queen in 2000. (In his lifetime he gave more than &pound;1 million to his college.) A legacy, supported by Trinity Hall, established a biannual lecture on &#145;The English novel&#146; in the English faculty in his name, the first being given in 2008.<br>
