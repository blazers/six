<span class="headword">Paulton,  Abraham Walter</span>  (1812&#150;1876), <span class="occ">politician and journalist</span>, was the son of Walter Paulton of Bolton, Lancashire, where he was born. His family were Roman Catholics, and he was sent to Stonyhurst College to be educated for the priesthood as a Jesuit. There his views underwent a change, and on leaving college at the age of sixteen or seventeen he was apprenticed to a surgeon named Rainforth at Bolton. His thirst for general knowledge was strong, and he began to take a deep interest in current political questions, especially that of the controversial corn laws. He began to address public meetings, and soon became a good speaker.<br>
<br>Deeper involvement in the anti-cornlaw movement, in particular a brilliantly successful speech at the Bolton theatre in July 1838, induced Paulton to abandon the medical profession and take up politics. The Bolton speech was a milestone for him. Taking over from the ineffective Dr Birnie, he spoke fluently and convincingly for fifteen minutes to revive interest in the meeting and was asked to return to deliver a fuller lecture. He was soon afterwards introduced to Cobden, and at the behest of Archibald Prentice became the first lecturer for the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>. He spoke at the Manchester corn exchange and Birmingham town hall in October and November 1838 and, between December 1838 and January 1839, spoke before a total of 80,000 people on a missionary tour in Lancashire. However, his suspected Chartist sympathies and frequent desire to address a wider radical agenda meant this and subsequent lecture tours (in London and Scotland) were frequently counter-productive to the league. He was removed from his lecturing post in April 1839 to edit the fortnightly <span class="italic">Anti-Corn-Law Circular</span> (<span class="italic">Anti-Bread-Tax Circular</span> from April 1841), the earliest organ of the league and published in Manchester. This was succeeded in September 1843 by <span class="italic">The League</span>, which had its headquarters in London.<br>
<br>When the repeal of the corn laws made the league redundant, Paulton returned to Manchester. In conjunction with Henry Rawson he purchased the <span class="italic">Manchester Times</span>, a newspaper representing the views of the more &#145;advanced section&#146; of the Liberal Party. This paper (later amalgamated with the <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner</span>) was managed by Paulton from 1848 to 1854.<br>
<br>In 1854 Paulton married Martha, daughter of James Mellor of Liverpool, and from that time he lived in London or at his country house, Boughton Hall, Surrey. In his retirement he remained interested in politics and current affairs and remained friendly with Cobden, John Bright, and other old associates. He was a man of great ability, deeply versed in political questions and the philosophy of politics, and in later years was keenly interested in physical science. His reputation was as a conversationalist of the first order. His writings, consisting mainly of newspaper articles, were not collected.<br>
<br>Paulton died at Boughton Hall on 6 June 1876, leaving his widow, a son, and a daughter. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
