<span class="headword">Wilkins, Sir  (George) Hubert</span>  (1888&#150;1958), <span class="occ">polar explorer and climatologist</span>, was born at Mount Bryan East, South Australia, on 31 October 1888, the thirteenth and youngest child of Harry Wilkins, grazier, and his wife, Louisa Smith. Until 1903 he lived and worked on his parents' sheep station where outdoor activities, coupled with his early experience of the devastation caused by drought, laid the foundations for his lifelong interest and work in the natural sciences, climatology, and meteorology.<br>
<br>From 1903 to 1908, at the Adelaide School of Mines, Wilkins studied electrical and general engineering, extending his studies also to photography and cinematography. In 1908 he left Australia as a ship stowaway and commenced his career of adventure in Algiers. Later he worked in London as a newspaper reporter and cameraman with assignments in many countries, the most interesting being some months in 1912 spent filming the fighting between the Turks and the Bulgarians. Over this general period he found time also to take flying lessons and to experiment in aerial photography.<br>
<br>The year 1913 saw the beginning of Wilkins's career as a polar explorer with his appointment as photographer to Vilhjalmur Stefansson's Canadian Arctic expedition. Thereafter, until early 1916 when he returned to Australia to enlist, he acquired much experience in the techniques of living, travelling, and working in the Arctic region, adding greatly to his knowledge of the natural sciences. He became convinced that the aeroplane could be used to explore and map the polar regions, and developed a plan to set up a series of permanent weather stations in those regions as part of a worldwide scheme for systematic and co-ordinated weather forecasting.<br>
<br>With a commission in the Australian Flying Corps, in May 1917 Wilkins was sent to Europe, where he was appointed assistant to the official photographer to the Australian forces, Captain Frank Hurley, of Antarctic fame. His subsequent work as a war photographer in France was of such quality that he rose to the rank of captain, received the MC and bar, and was twice mentioned in dispatches. He was several times wounded and acquired a reputation for daring, courage, and leadership.<br>
<br>The war over, Wilkins gained further flying experience, first as navigator on an unsuccessful attempt to fly from England to Australia in late 1919, then in British airships. Later he was appointed photographer to a mission sent to the Dardanelles to reconstruct the Gallipoli campaign. On his discharge from the services he immediately took steps to further his own plans for polar exploration. But his scheme for polar weather stations was rejected by the Royal Meteorological Society, while a proposal to fly an airship in the Arctic received no support in either England or Germany. Finally, in 1920&#150;21 he had his first taste of work in the Antarctic as second-in-command of J. L. Cope's ill-fated expedition working in the Graham Land area. This was followed by service as naturalist with Sir Ernest Shackleton in his <i>Quest</i> expedition, and later by a period in Soviet Russia spent surveying and filming the effects of drought and famine&#151;subjects close to his mind since they reiterated the need for an international weather forecasting service. Next came an expedition (1923&#150;5) for the British Museum through northern Australia, to carry out a biological survey and to collect specimens of the rarer mammals. His book <span class="italic">Undiscovered Australia</span> (1928) shows clearly the extent and high quality of his work, the collections made including plants, birds, insects, fish, minerals, fossils, and Aboriginal artefacts, as well as mammals. The expedition also proved Wilkins's skill as a project organizer and leader of men.<br>
<br>After plans for an Antarctic expedition failed through shortage of funds, Wilkins turned his attention to the Arctic, where he successfully carried out a remarkable programme of pioneering air exploration with the American army pilot Carl Ben Eielson. On one expedition they experienced engine failure during a blizzard and were forced to make a landing on pack ice 550 miles from their point of departure, Point Barrow in Alaska. They endured a fourteen-day walk to safety, during which they drew heavily on the survival experience that Wilkins had gained with Stefansson's Arctic expedition. With stretched finances Wilkins managed somehow to acquire a new plane and in April 1928 the pair set out in a Lockheed Vega on their historic flight from Barrow eastward over the Arctic Ocean, to Spitsbergen. The purposes behind this remarkable exploit (as indicated in his book <span class="italic">Flying the Arctic</span>, 1928) were to prove the value of the aeroplane for polar exploration; to demonstrate the viability of air passenger routes over polar lands; and to further Wilkins's cherished plan for polar meteorological stations. In June of that year Wilkins was knighted by the king in London.<br>
<br>Wilkins next revived his plans for aerial exploration in the Antarctic where between 1928 and 1930 he led two expeditions, making, with Eielson, the first flight in that area on 16 November 1928, as well as numerous significant geographical observations and discoveries from the air. Wilkins's reputation as a pioneer of the air age in polar regions was by now firmly established.<br>
<br>In 1929 Wilkins married a fellow Australian then working in New York as an actress, Suzanne Bennett (Bennett was a stage name), daughter of John Evans, a mining engineer of Victoria, Australia. They had no children. It was a happy marriage in which both parties by mutual agreement pursued their chosen careers.<br>
<br>In 1931 came Wilkins's famous venture by submarine in Arctic waters, made, as he explained in <span class="italic">Under the North Pole: the Wilkins&#150;Ellsworth Submarine Expedition</span> (1931), with the twofold purpose of exploring the region from Spitsbergen westwards via the north pole to the Siberian coast, and experimenting with the craft as a weather station, both above and below the ice and in radio contact with the outside world. For this expedition Wilkins was lent a submarine by the United States navy, which he renamed <i>Nautilus</i>. The submarine suffered engine failure during the Atlantic crossing and eventually left Bergen for the Arctic circle on 5 August. When an attempt was made to dive under the ice, on 22 August, it was discovered that <i>Nautilus</i> had been sabotaged by crew members, who had detached the diving rudders. Wilkins refused to be put off by the unwillingness of his crew to follow and kept the submarine on the edge of the ice pack, conducting useful scientific experiments over previously unexplored seabed. Then, early in September, he achieved his objective by filling the ballast tanks and diving slowly at the ice edge, forcing <i>Nautilus</i> under, where she remained for more than an hour in spite of the terrifying noise of the ice rending on the hull. On 8 September the radio masts were re-erected and Wilkins ended five days of radio silence to communicate to the outside world that the voyage was over. The transmission ended speculation that a disaster had overtaken the expedition. Having failed to reach the North Pole, Wilkins found himself branded a failure and &#145;pilloried as an irresponsible adventurer&#146;: nothing, though, &#145;could shake his belief in the principles of submarine exploration&#146;  (Grierson, 148). It was entirely due to his resolve that <i>Nautilus</i> had become the first vessel ever to operate beneath the Arctic ice pack, and he had led a scientific programme that revealed the potential for future research, achievements that fully justified the endeavour.<br>
<br>The thirties also saw Wilkins working with the American Lincoln Ellsworth on four expeditions to the Antarctic continent, using the ship <i>Wyatt Earp</i> and aeroplanes. He also played a major role in the search operations for the Soviet aviator Sigismund Levanevsky and his crew, who were lost over the Arctic Ocean in August 1937. Wilkins offered his services to the Soviet government, and was accepted, and spent until March 1938 engaged in the search. At the same time he carried out pioneering work in moonlight flying under winter conditions; a large programme of meteorological work; and constant studies of ice movements from the air. In June 1938 he was received by Stalin in Moscow, as a gesture of Soviet gratitude, and addressed a meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences.<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1939 Wilkins, who was in the United States, was rejected by the British and Australian governments for war work, on account of his age. But he was subsequently employed by the American government, first in missions concerned with aircraft manufacture on behalf of the allied powers; and later in missions through the office of strategic services, work which took him to the Middle and Far East. With the entry of America into the war he served from 1942 onwards as a geographer, climatologist, and Arctic adviser with the US quartermaster-general's corps, being particularly concerned with the development of efficient operational and survival techniques and equipment for the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. After the war he served first with the US Navy office of scientific research (1946&#150;7), then in an advisory capacity with the US weather bureau, later with the Arctic Institute of North America. Finally in 1953 he was appointed geographer to the research and development command, specializing in studies and research connected with human activities in the polar regions.<br>
<br>Wilkins had the restless mind and outlook of the true pioneer. He possessed tremendous mental and physical drive&#151;assets which, joined to a vivid imagination and a supreme faith in his purpose, enabled him to overcome all obstacles. He was continually on the move, being irresistibly drawn to new ideas and practical projects. He rarely concerned himself with the more obvious results, implications, and significance of an achievement and consequently the published records of his many projects and expeditions were unfortunately scanty. Some of his findings were later proved to be erroneous, most notably his &#145;discovery&#146; during the 1928&#150;9 aerial Antarctic expedition that Graham Land was an archipelago and not a peninsula as previously thought. Evidence put before the Royal Geographical Society in London in 1940 proved conclusively that Wilkins was wrong, but he appeared not to be unduly concerned. The error, and Wilkins's lack of interest in its cause, led to him being regarded with some suspicion in scientific circles, but he was primarily a field explorer and trail-blazer, working to a clear if long-range plan, based upon his conviction of the necessity for a worldwide meteorological organization. He was convinced that a direct relationship existed between the meteorology of the polar regions and weather conditions elsewhere and that a full knowledge of polar geography would be required before his plan for polar weather stations could be realized. In these fields he was a pioneer, as he was in polar exploration by air and submarine.<br>
<br>Wilkins was reticent, self-sufficient, and infinitely adaptable. Interested in everything, he enjoyed the company of his fellows, yet found it easy to live and work among primitive peoples, if only because he shared their intense awareness of nature in all her moods. He had a strong religious background and was actively interested in such matters as telepathy and life after death. Solitary by nature and by no means the ordinary gregarious man, he was yet a good mixer and companion both on and off the job.<br>
<br>Wilkins was a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society and of the Royal Geographical Society, which awarded him its patron's medal. Among the many other medals which he received were the Samuel Finley Breese Morse medal from the American Geographical Society, the gold medal of the International League of Aviators, and the Norwegian Air Club's gold medal of honour. He was a companion of the order of St Maurice and St Lazarus of Italy and in 1955 received the honorary degree of DSc from the University of Alaska.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1958 Wilkins died suddenly in his hotel at Framingham, Massachusetts. He had lived to see the under-ice transits of the Arctic Sea by the American nuclear submarines <i>Nautilus</i> and <i>Skate</i>, in August 1958, and it was particularly fitting that the latter vessel should facilitate Wilkins's often expressed wish that his ashes might be scattered near the north pole. In March 1959 <i>Skate</i> effected this rite, breaking through the polar ice after a long and hazardous voyage, of the kind Wilkins himself had pioneered.<br>
