<span class="headword">Magnus,  Thomas</span>  (1463/4&#150;1550), <span class="occ">administrator and diplomat</span>, was born in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, the son of John Magnus and his wife, Alice. His early education is obscure, but he rose in consequence of the patronage of Thomas Savage, archbishop of York, beginning royal service as chaplain to Henry VII and establishing himself as an important figure in northern diplomacy and administration. He had achieved sufficient favour to receive the archdeaconry of the East Riding of Yorkshire from 1504, and he worked as a treasurer with the northern armies, sending diplomatic reports back to the council from Scotland and the north of England. He established a close personal relationship with Henry VIII's sister, Margaret Tudor, queen of Scotland, who describes him as counsellor and chaplain in letters to her brother, and he served on a number of diplomatic missions to Scotland, including commissions to negotiate Anglo-Scottish truces. He was incorporated at Oxford in 1520, having already obtained a doctorate abroad, and was with the king that year at the Field of Cloth of Gold, serving also as a member of the council. Magnus was a notable example of the civil service pluralist who was instrumental, through assiduous royal service, in consolidating the Henrician Reformation.<br>
<br>Rewards heaped on Magnus for loyal service included a canonry at Windsor from 1520 to 1547, and the prebend of North Kelsey in the diocese of Lincoln from 1521 to 1522 and of Corringham from 1522 to 1549. In 1524 Wolsey, fearing the influence of the pro-French lobby in Scotland, entrusted Magnus with the task of reconciling Margaret with her second husband, Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus. The mission proved unsuccessful owing to Margaret's unrelenting antipathy towards Angus. Four years later Magnus was instructed to attempt a reconciliation between James V, following his assumption of royal authority in 1528, and his former chancellor the pro-English Angus. When, early in 1529, James gave Magnus his version of the events of 1528, the latter took the opportunity to deliver a warning to the young king about the dangers of using &#145;yong consaill&#146;, citing as an example the fate of James III in a lecture impertinently threatening to a crowned monarch and inaccurate in its content. Impetus was lent to Magnus's efforts by the fear that James would contract a foreign marriage alliance. In the face of this threat Wolsey was adamant that Angus should be reinstated in order to act as Henry's agent in Scotland. To strengthen the earl's position Magnus was instructed to deny rumours that Angus had ever intended to kidnap James at the instruction of the English king. However, the complexities of Scottish border and national politics rendered it virtually impossible for the earl to regain his influence with James.<br>
<br>In 1525 Henry sent his illegitimate son Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond, to head the council of the north. Magnus served as the council's surveyor and receiver-general, devoting great effort to the reorganization of its poorly ordered accounts and records. As a royal agent, he also pressured the northern clergy to pay a large fine to the king to avoid charges under the <span class="roman">Statute of Praemunire</span>, and in 1533 he assisted Rowland Lee, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, to induce the northern convocation to accept the unpopular royal divorce. Henry's gratitude meant that by the mid-1530s Magnus held the masterships of St Leonard's Hospital at York, the college of St Sepulchre, near York Minster, and Sibthorpe College, Nottinghamshire, in addition to being vicar of Kendal, Westmorland, and rector of Bedale, Kirkby in Cleveland and Sessay, all in the North Riding of Yorkshire. It is a measure of his importance that his eight benefices in the diocese of York alone yielded &pound;814 per annum.<br>
<br>On 21 April 1533 Magnus wrote to Thomas Cromwell, the king's secretary, stating that he had sent to Nottinghamshire for his horses to go north to the convocation at York although he had been sick, his &#145;old body now so oft clogged with infirmity and unwieldiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 6.361). Nevertheless, he lived for another seventeen years, serving on royal commissions, as JP for all three ridings of Yorkshire from 1538 to 1550, and on the council of the north. He was present in 1535 when Lee preached a sermon supporting Henry's break with Rome and, in a report dated 1 July 1535 concerning the conformity found in the charter house and parish church of Hull, Magnus states that there &#145;is not a more quiet jurisdiction than my archdeaconry&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 8.968).<br>
<br>In 1536 Thomas Darcy, Baron Darcy, wrote to the king mentioning the assistance given to him by Magnus concerning the insurrection in Lincolnshire and the East Riding, and the archdeacon was also involved in the suppression of the monasteries. In a plea to the king from Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, on 16 June 1537 to strengthen the council of the north, he referred to Magnus as a good old man, although less able every day. Indeed, infirmity in the form of a bad leg prevented Magnus from going to see the king in December 1537. He continued to take part in the council, his signature appearing in its records over the next few years, but on 1 December 1539 he surrendered the mastership of St Leonard's Hospital and all his possessions in York in exchange for a pension, a dwelling house, the grange of Beningborough in Yorkshire, and other grants. He was cultivated by the new regime of Edward VI. Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector, paid him an annuity of &pound;15 11<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. in 1547&#150;8 out of his own purse.<br>
<br>In 1529 Magnus founded a grammar school and chantry to pray for the souls of his father, mother, and sisters, but his intention was rendered void by the dissolution of chantries in the late 1540s. He died aged eighty-six at Sessay on 28 August 1550 and was buried beneath a portrait brass in the chancel of the parish church there, notwithstanding his wish, expressed in his will, to be buried in York Minster beside his erstwhile patron, Savage.<br>
