<span class="headword">Hawkyns,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1630), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and diplomatic agent</span>, was the son of John Hawkyns and his wife, Ann Yelverton. He was connected to the leading East Anglian protestant families through his mother, and was probably born at Wisbech on property which she had acquired through her first marriage to Thomas Rede. Hawkyns matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1568, and graduated BA in 1571 or 1572 and MA in 1575. He became a fellow of Peterhouse in 1575 and served as a university proctor in 1583&#150;4. In March 1584 he entered Gray's Inn, where many of his relatives were members, being admitted on the same day as fellow puritans Sir Richard Knightley and Humphrey Davenport. In November 1585 Hawkyns was given leave from Peterhouse to join the staff of Sir Thomas Cecil, newly appointed as governor of Brill. It is unclear how long he served as legal adviser in the Low Countries, but he was nominated to accompany Edward, eleventh Lord Zouche, &#145;for conference in learning&#146; during his European tour in July 1586  (Walker, 1.267). Hawkyns's name may have been suggested to Zouche by mutual contacts at Gray's Inn.<br>
<br>Zouche's party left England in March 1587 and spent the next few years travelling through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Hawkyns apparently left Zouche and returned to England by March 1591, when Archbishop Whitgift wrote to the University of Cambridge and requested that he be made doctor of laws on the basis of his study in European universities, especially Padua, where he had been unable to take his degree for religious reasons. Hawkyns received the degree, but had to perform the requisite exercises in Cambridge. He now began to be &#145;employed in publick matters of state&#146;  (Hammer, 362) and was resident in London, relying upon Whitgift to prevent the forfeiture of his fellowship at Peterhouse on grounds of absenteeism. In 1594 Hawkyns visited Scotland, probably as an aide to Lord Zouche, who served as Elizabeth's special ambassador to James VI during the early months of the year.<br>
<br>In mid-1595 Hawkyns was chosen for a quasi-diplomatic role as gatherer of intelligence and formal representative of the earl of Essex in Venice. Approved by the queen, this venture was intended to co-ordinate intelligence gathering by Italian contacts of Antonio Perez, the exiled former secretary of Philip II of Spain, to recruit new spies in Italy, and to establish an open, but deniable, diplomatic presence for England. More covertly, the agent at Venice was also expected to burnish the earl's international reputation. Hawkyns was chosen for this position in some haste, after the sudden death of the original choice, Peter Wroth. Essex and Elizabeth clearly approved Hawkyns's nomination at the urging of Anthony Bacon, who oversaw the Venice operation on the earl's behalf. Bacon was a distant relative of Hawkyns, a fellow member of Gray's Inn, and regular correspondent and former student of Whitgift. Bacon presumably judged that Hawkyns's expertise and travel, together with his continuing correspondence with foreign contacts such as Richard Willoughby of Padua, made him an ideal choice for Essex's work.<br>
<br>Hawkyns was based at Venice from December 1595 until about March 1598. After an uncomfortable start (which helped to spark a feud between Bacon and Henry Wotton, one of the earl's secretaries), he proved an adequate co-ordinator of intelligence from Venice  (Ungerer, vol. 2), but his resolute puritanism made him a less than ideal diplomat in a Catholic country. A complaint by the tutor of Francis Davison, who travelled through Venice in 1596, criticized Hawkyns, perhaps unfairly, for being both petty and excessively proud of his quasi-ambassadorial status  (BL, Harley MS 296, fol. 114<i>v</i>). Hawkyns visited Vienna and Paris on his journey home to England. He finally resigned from Peterhouse in January 1599. Unfortunately his hopes of further advancement, as promised by Essex and Bacon, were dashed by the earl's declining influence and subsequent collapse into political oblivion. As a well-known partisan of Essex, Hawkyns was arrested after the earl's London insurrection in February 1601 and briefly placed in the custody of Alderman Lee. Although Hawkyns was a commissioner for the admiralty court in Middlesex in 1603, his career apparently never recovered from the fall of Essex and the death soon afterwards of Anthony Bacon.<br>
<br>Hawkyns's will indicates that he spent his old age in the company of influential London puritans such as William Gouge, Richard Sibbs, and John Davenport. His legacies included money for the poor of the French church in London, distressed protestant ministers in England and Germany, and towards the purchase of impropriated livings. He also provided &pound;300 to build almshouses for the godly poor of Wisbech, &pound;100 &#145;for the erecting of twoe new <span class="roman">Bible</span> clarks&#146; at Peterhouse, and various bequests (including his books) to members of the Hatcher family of Careby, Lincolnshire, to whom he was related by the marriage of his half-sister, Katherine Rede, the child of his mother's first marriage. Hawkyns apparently never married; he died in London in early December 1630 and was buried on 15 December at St Andrew's, Holborn.<br>
