<span class="headword">Liggins,  Joseph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1806&#150;1872), <span class="occ">literary impostor</span>, was born at Attleborough, a village near Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the only son of a baker, William Liggins, and his wife, Sarah. He matriculated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in 1824, but was rusticated and left without taking his degree. He travelled in Europe, and in 1830&#150;33 was a tutor on the Isle of Man, subsequently returning to Warwickshire to a life of quiet poverty, until he was catapulted to fame by the assumption in and around Nuneaton that he was the new, unknown, author &#145;George Eliot&#146;.<br>
<br>The real author of <span class="italic">Scenes of Clerical Life</span>, three stories of midland life published first in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> between January and November 1857, then in two volumes in January 1858, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6794/', "Marian Evans")</script>, a free-thinking &#145;strong-minded woman&#146; (Thomas Carlyle's phrase). She and the writer and journalist G. H. Lewes lived together as man and wife from 1854 until Lewes's death in 1878, as he was unable to divorce his wife.<br>
<br>Marian Evans&#151;or Mary Anne, as she was baptized in 1819 in Chilvers Coton church, near Attleborough&#151;was brought up in and around Nuneaton, the setting of the three stories of <span class="italic">Scenes of Clerical Life</span>&#151;&#145;The Sad Fortunes of the Revd Amos Barton&#146;, &#145;Mr Gilfil's Love Story&#146;, and &#145;Janet's Repentance&#146;. In them the author drew on personal memories and on hearsay about local clergymen and their families which she had picked up during her childhood and youth. So detailed and credible is her representation of the town and village life of the area that local people&#151;including her own family, from whom she was estranged and who knew nothing of her literary life in London&#151;began to speculate about the authorship. Liggins was first declared to be the author by the reviewer of &#145;Janet's Repentance&#146; in the <span class="italic">Manx Sun</span> of 4 July 1857, who remembered this &#145;gentleman of our own acquaintance, an old Cantab, and well known in this island some five-and-twenty years or more ago&#146;. The <span class="italic">Manx Sun</span> of 21 May 1859 added, in an article on <span class="italic">Adam Bede</span>, that Liggins had lived on the Isle of Man between 1830 and 1833. In the 1841 census he is recorded as being aged thirty-five and living in Church Street, Attleborough, with his parents. No profession or trade is entered against his name.<br>
<br>Marian Evans was at first amused at the rumour, welcoming it as a smokescreen behind which she could hide, but when her first full-length novel, <span class="italic">Adam Bede</span>, was published to immediate acclaim in February 1859, the universal curiosity about the identity of the author became burdensome, especially as Liggins neglected to disclaim authorship. It became known that he was living in straitened circumstances, and various midlands clergymen and magistrates accused George Eliot's publisher, Blackwood &amp; Sons, of cheating Liggins of his due financial reward. Letters appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span> claiming Liggins's authorship. Elizabeth Gaskell, Harriet Martineau, and other well-known authors took up the claim, until in June 1859 Marian Evans and G. H. Lewes were obliged to reveal the true identity of George Eliot in order to put a stop to the wild Liggins stories. Dickens, who had been convinced on reading <span class="italic">Scenes of Clerical Life</span> and <span class="italic">Adam Bede</span> that the author was a woman, exulted to Lewes in August 1859, when the secret was at last out: &#145;I have a horrible and unnatural desire upon me to see Liggins, whom, I am proud to remember I contemptuously rejected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 9.104).<br>
<br>After the Liggins myth had thus finally been scotched, the enigmatic supposed author settled back into obscurity in Nuneaton, dying destitute in the workhouse at Chilvers Coton in late May 1872. He was buried on 1 June at Attleborough. Joseph Liggins is perhaps the only person commemorated in the <span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</span> for having achieved nothing of importance or influence, except to have been a thorn in the side of a sensitive author.<br>
