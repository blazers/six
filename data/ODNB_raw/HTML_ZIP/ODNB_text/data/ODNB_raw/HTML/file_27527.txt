<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tompion,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1713), <span class="occ">horologist and maker of scientific instruments</span>, was baptized on 25 July 1639 at Northill, Bedfordshire, the eldest of three surviving offspring of Thomas Tompion (<i>d</i>. 1665), a blacksmith, and his wife, Margaret, of Ickwell, a hamlet in the parish of Northill. Nothing is known of his childhood but it is likely that he watched his father at work with the hammer and anvil and that he eventually practised forging metal under his tuition. Apart from this experience it is not known if he was ever formally apprenticed or how he learned the skills which brought him fame. He is believed to have left Ickwell before his father's death in 1665 because the blacksmithing business was continued by the younger son James.<h2>
<a name="Earlyworkandinnovation"></a>Early work and innovation</h2>The nature of even Tompion's earliest recorded commissions bespeaks a pioneering craftsman of unparalleled versatility. In 1671 he cast a church bell of 4 cwt, in 1674 he made a turret clock for the Tower of London and a quadrant for the Royal Society, and, in 1675, he made a longcase clock with a dead-beat escapement for Sir Jonas Moore and a balance-spring watch for Charles II. By about 1680 he had produced the first of a group of two-train grande-sonnerie clocks whose workmanship is finer and more complex than that of any earlier English timepiece recorded.<br>
<br>Tompion is first recorded in London early in 1671 when he occupied one of the first post-fire houses to be rebuilt in Water Lane, a narrow byway running south towards the Thames from Fleet Street. After a search of his premises by Clockmakers' Company officials in July 1671 he was admitted to the company as a brother at the next quarter court on 4 September and he bought his freedom on 20 April 1674. Soon after, he enrolled the first of at least twenty-four apprentices bound during his career.<br>
<br>In the same year he became acquainted with two most influential men, both enthusiastic supporters of the advancement of scientific knowledge, Robert Hooke (1635&#150;1703), curator of experiments for the Royal Society, and the mathematician Sir Jonas Moore (1627&#150;1679), who took up residence at the Tower upon his appointment as surveyor-general of the ordnance in 1669. Hooke kept a diary which contains many references to Tompion and the projects they worked on, to social meetings, and topics they discussed. He first employed Tompion on behalf of the society to make a quadrant (with telescopic sights supplied by Cock) to demonstrate his criticism of the method of naked-eye astronomical observation. Tompion made other fine mathematical instruments and barometers. His &#145;quicksilver weatherglass&#146; was advertised in the <span class="italic">Royal Almanac</span> of 1677, which suggests that his was one of the first shops to offer mercury barometers for sale. Three fine barometers survive in the Royal Collection, two having been made for William III.<br>
<br>It was presumably Moore who commissioned Tompion to make the &#145;extraord<sup>y</sup> Clock for the new Tower over the powder rooms&#146; installed in the latter half of 1674, and early in 1675 he made for Moore a longcase clock which had a dead-beat escapement&#151;one of the earliest recorded instances of its use&#151;which stood in his dining-room. This was the first of at least three escapements, the others being another dead-beat design for clocks, and a &#145;virgule&#146; for watches, which Tompion inexplicably chose to abandon, and their great potential lay dormant until the 1720s when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11190/', "George Graham (c.1673&#150;1751)")</script> modified the designs.<br>
<br>In 1675 when Huygens wrote from Paris of his invention of a watch with a balance-spring, Hooke indignantly reminded the Royal Society of his lectures on the subject delivered some years earlier, and a rough draft of his patent application of about 1660 survives to prove his previous involvement. There is no evidence, however, that he had achieved the use of a spiral spring and Huygens clearly deserves credit for that crucial advance. With a view to obstructing the patent application being sought for Huygens's invention, Hooke, accompanied by Moore and Tompion, was received in audience by the king to plead his case. In the event neither party was granted exclusive rights but Charles evidently ordered Hooke to produce a watch of his design and, with Moore's encouragement, Hooke commissioned Tompion to work on it. It is said to have been signed &#145;Robert Hooke inven. 1658. T. Tompion fecit 1675&#146; but neither this, nor any of the small number believed to have been made and similarly signed, is known to have survived; James, duke of York, and Prince Rupert are both believed to have owned examples and two were made for the dauphin. Tompion soon abandoned its unnecessarily complicated escapement&#151;it had two balances geared together&#151;in favour of a single balance.<br>
<br>This important new advance still required some regulating device, and the standard method adopted by the majority of British makers of verge and cylinder movements from the late 1670s until the nineteenth century incorporated a pinion and a toothed rack with curb-pins. This device is known as &#145;Tompion regulation&#146; but although he was among the first to use it, it cannot be shown that he was the inventor. The introduction of a successful balance-spring, with its controlling influence improving accuracy, served to encourage and enable further experimentation in movement design and in manufacturing methods.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1676 Tompion moved his business and household into more extensive premises on the west side of Water Lane at the corner of the junction with Fleet Street (the site, no. 67 Fleet Street, is now identified by a blue plaque). His cotenant for the ensuing eight years, Jasper Braem, was a cabinet maker and inlayer of marquetry and there can be little doubt that he was responsible for many of the fine longcases of this period containing Tompion movements and dials; it is not inconceivable that he also made cases for other clockmakers and he may even have offered other items of furniture for sale in Tompion's shop. Braem was the first of several cotenants to share the property with Tompion but none of later date has yet been shown to have had horological leanings. Tompion traded from these premises for the rest of his life and his successor, Graham, remained until 1720 when he moved the business to the north side of Fleet Street.<br>
<br>Also in 1676, Tompion was commissioned by Moore to make a pair of year-going timepieces for the newly built Royal Observatory at Greenwich, which served John Flamsteed (1646&#150;1719), the first astronomer royal, during his 35-year incumbency. Using these in harness with other instruments, including a quadrant that Tompion helped to make, Flamsteed was able to determine that the periods of the sun's successive crossings of the meridian are not regular but follow the table of equation which he had calculated. He also established that the earth revolves at a constant rate (a finding which was not challenged until the twentieth century), and he compiled a catalogue of 3000 stars, and tables of planetary motions and timings of Jupiter's moons. Both clocks have survived though their dead-beat escapements have been converted to recoil for domestic use. One has been in the British Museum since 1927, the other was returned to the observatory in 1994. Each dial bears the inscription: &#145;S<sup>r</sup> Jonas Moore Caused this Movement With great Care to be thus Made A<sup>o</sup> 1676 by Tho Tompion&#146;.<br>
<br>Tompion's outstanding group of two-train grande-sonnerie clocks, the first of which was probably made in the late 1670s, incorporated a new type of striking mechanism termed rack and snail, which allowed the time to be determined, by bells, at any time upon pulling a cord; it was of particular use in bedrooms during hours of darkness. Perhaps inspired by an early Tompion quarter-repeating mechanism which utilized a six-step snail (but no rack), it was devised by the Revd Edward Barlow alias Booth (1639&#150;1719). These were also the first table-clocks to have a pendulum suspension spring of flat steel strip whose use enabled another new device, rise-and-fall regulation, which allowed the owner to adjust the clock's rate simply by moving a hand on the dial.<br>
<br>Tompion went to some lengths, especially during the period 1675&#150;90, to keep new designs secret by preventing easy access to the movements of the first retail models. Several early examples had secret locking bolts securing their movements within the cases, while other cases had no back door so that not even the back plate could be seen. Similarly, the earliest repeating watch movements were locked into their cases by secret latches.<h2>
<a name="Retailingandwealth"></a>Retailing and wealth</h2>The prestigious commissions of the 1670s enhanced Tompion's reputation and the fact that during this period he was occasionally obliged to buy in movements from other makers to be finished for retail in his own shop is evidence of his failure to satisfy all demands for his wares. It was probably this inability which encouraged the adoption of a rudimentary form of mass production of clocks and watches to ensure a steady supply of standard models for retail. Their cases, dials, and movements were almost certainly made in batches to await selection for assembly and sale and by the early 1680s as many as 100 to 150 watches and fifteen to twenty clocks were being retailed each year, figures which remained surprisingly consistent throughout his career. Increased production was not accompanied by a reduction in the quality of workmanship but rather the opposite. Improvements in manufacturing methods, the continual modernization of machinery, and the honing of individual skills all enabled greater precision in both production and performance and Tompion's business continued to offer the largest selection of items of the best quality. Most of Tompion's apprentices can be identified in the records of the Clockmakers' Company and while some are known to have remained in his employment after they were made free they could never have constituted a large enough body to account for the prolific output. Other employees and workshops were undoubtedly involved but very little is known of the network of selected artisans which would have developed as his business grew, persons he employed on his own premises as journeymen and work-masters, and elsewhere as outworkers. Between 1676 and 1691, for instance, Nathaniel Delander's workshop in Old Bailey supplied Tompion with well over a thousand watch-cases.<br>
<br>From about 1680 by far the greater number of items sold were standard stock items, timepiece watches, eight-day table clocks and timepieces, and thirty-hour, eight-day, or month-going longcase clocks. With most of this work delegated to others Tompion would have acted as overseer and probably spent time on unusual commissions, experimenting with and improving designs, and personally serving prestigious customers. He also employed a clerk, probably from the early 1680s, who would have dealt with accounts as well as serving in the shop. By the 1690s Tompion was a wealthy man. In June 1694 he bought &pound;1000 worth of Bank of England stock (he was one of the first subscribers), and the 1695 assessment on marriages, etc., classed him as an individual with personal estate worth not less than &pound;600 or real estate worth not less than &pound;50 per year. He also invested money in the Million Bank, to the tune of &pound;1500 by 1704. For small business transactions he employed, at least from 1702, the services of Sir Richard Hoare, banker, at the nearby sign of the Golden Bottle, Temple Bar. In 1684 he was excused from serving as steward to the Clockmakers' Company when he claimed he was sick and busy altering his house, but he kept his word and served the following year instead. In 1691 he was elected to the court of assistants and later served as junior warden (1700), renter warden (1701), senior warden (1702), and finally master in 1703.<br>
<br>Apart from his earlier role in the introduction of the balance-spring Tompion was at the forefront in improving other aspects of watch design. When Edward Barlow applied for a patent for repeating watches, Tompion made the watch produced in court in March 1687, but James II ruled in favour of one made by Daniel Quare who countered Barlow's claim, Tompion's watch having two separate push-pieces while Quare's had just one. By about 1689 Tompion had developed a standard retail model which was of sturdier and more reliable construction than those of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>A deficiency of early watches with cases pierced to allow the sound of a bell to escape was their tendency to clog with dust and fluff. Tompion was probably the first maker to introduce a protective ring to encircle the movement, and about 1704 he began covering the balance-cock with a cap. It was not until ten years later, however, that these components were combined, probably by Graham or Quare, to form a dust-cap which effectively enclosed the movement; this became a standard component of the English watch.<br>
<br>In 1695, in conjunction with Booth and William Houghton, Tompion patented (no. 344) the first watch escapement to incorporate a horizontal escape wheel acting directly on a single balance arbor (the type later named virgule), whereby both the contrate and crown wheels were eliminated. The venture was not successful and production was soon abandoned (one incomplete movement was noted as part of his sixth recorded series) but George Graham returned to the idea thirty years later to achieve a substantial result&#151;the cylinder escapement. In common with other leading London watchmakers Tompion began about 1710 to use diamond endstones for the balance-pivots of most repeating watches and of a few timepieces, to reduce friction and wear.<h2>
<a name="Tompionsrecordsystem"></a>Tompion's record system</h2>It is possible that during Tompion's career well over a hundred employees contributed to the production and retail of those items bearing his name, working to the high standards which he himself set. This resulted in a uniformity in workshop procedures&#151;a house style&#151;which prevents any positive identification of an individual's work, and even Tompion's hand is unrecognizable in all but the earlier pre-standardization items. It was inevitable that such an output would soon necessitate a record system to ensure easy identification of items, and serial numbers, undoubtedly linked to ledger records, were placed on most of the standard watches and clocks.<br>
<br>At least six individual numbered series were begun, some of which were later merged together. The first was for all types of watch being produced at the time the series started about 1681. In 1683&#150;94 the numbers were often coded. After Tompion's death in 1713 the series was continued by Graham and after his death in 1751 Colley used it until the 1760s. The second series, for spring-driven clocks, begun about 1682, and that for weight-driven clocks, probably begun at the same time, were merged together by about 1686. The series included all types of clock except a small number of special commissions, chiefly those for royal residences, and turret clocks. Graham continued the series, apparently until his death, although several late unnumbered examples are recorded. A series for repeating watches, begun about 1688 soon after their introduction, was continued by Graham and then Colley until about 1760. A fifth series, for clockwatches and alarm-watches, began about 1692, and from that time series 1 was used exclusively for timepieces. Graham continued series 5 but abandoned it about 1720, perhaps when he moved the business, whereupon these watches were included in the timepiece or the repeater series. The sixth series was for watches with the Tompion&#150;Houghton&#150;Booth virgule escapement, begun about 1695 but abandoned almost immediately.<br>
<br>The cases of several longcase clocks dating from about 1700 have been found to bear a secondary number, quite separate from Tompion's serial number, which may relate to a new case-maker's own records. No business records (other than a small number of sales receipts) are known to have survived and not a single manuscript in Tompion's hand is recorded. His signature appears on many documents, however, chiefly relating to Clockmakers' Company matters.<h2>
<a name="Royalpatronage"></a>Royal patronage</h2>Tompion's goods were more costly than those of his contemporaries and his customers were chiefly from the highest and wealthiest ranks of society, from the royal household to the nobility and gentry. Though he was never appointed royal clockmaker Tompion enjoyed royal patronage. Apart from the early balance-spring watch Hooke also refers to a striking clock made for Charles II, but it was during the 1690s that Tompion produced his finest royal commissions. William III's extravagance allowed the clockmaker free rein and several clocks were supplied with movements displaying the very best of his mechanical genius. Their cases, of matching quality, were almost certainly designed in collaboration with Daniel Marot, William's versatile designer of interior and exterior decorative features from wallpaper to gardens. The finest examples include the spring-driven year-going Mostyn Tompion, an ebony, silver, and gilt bracket-clock (now in the British Museum), a silver-cased travelling-clock whose movement (stolen from a private collection during the 1980s) has a dial-operated mechanism which allows for the choice of pendulum or balance control, a walnut year-going equation longcase timepiece at Kensington Palace, and the so-called &#145;record Tompion&#146;, named after an early twentieth-century sale price, a walnut three-month longcase clock now owned by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Virginia, USA. In addition he supplied three finely cased barometers, two of which now hang at Hampton Court, the other at Kensington Palace.<br>
<br>When Tompion petitioned Queen Anne for payment of William's unsettled debts she replied that she had &#145;no occasion for his clocks and watches&#146;  (State Papers, privy purse, 1703, TNA: PRO T 29/14, fol. 92). And yet Treasury accounts show that Tompion was employed upon work both for Anne and her husband, George, prince of Denmark. At Buckingham Palace is another year-going equation timepiece which is believed to have been made in 1703 for George, and he may also have owned the exceptional small silver and gilt travelling-clock with grande-sonnerie striking, quarter-repeat, and alarm, and choice of balance or pendulum control, now in the British Museum.<br>
<br>Tompion's reputation spread beyond Britain and among those who owned one of his clocks or watches were Carl XI of Sweden, Philip V of Spain, Cosimo III, Tsar Peter the Great, Karl, landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, and the dauphin. Some of the pieces were diplomatic gifts but others were probably ordered by ambassadors in London on behalf of their sovereigns. Peter the Great obtained his clock, a &#145;pendulum clock contrived to bear the motions of the sea&#146;, from the cabin of Admiral Sir John Norris during a dinner party held on board the <i>Ranelagh</i> in 1715. When the tsarina presented him with a diamond-studded snuff-box Norris felt obliged to part with the clock, along with some chairs, when they were admired by the tsar. Other adventurous works include an extraordinary month-going miniature boxwood longcase day and night clock with ting-tang quarter-strike, Roman notation hour-strike, and, to illuminate pierced dial numerals, oil lamps which are snuffed out automatically at a pre-set time. Also worthy of note is the group of complex three-train grande-sonnerie clocks like that given to Cosimo III, grand duke of Tuscany, by William III, and probably one of the items which the king failed to pay for. Tompion's reputation was such that watches fraudulently inscribed with his name were being made in the Netherlands and Switzerland at the end of the seventeenth century, and they could also be bought in Rome. Tompion published several editions of tables of equation as well as instructions, in English and French, for regulating watches.<h2>
<a name="TheTompionfamily"></a>The Tompion family</h2>Other members of the Tompion family were associated with him in London. Margaret, his sister, may have accompanied him when he moved to St Bride's about 1671; that was her address when she married one Stephen Kent in 1674. She was widowed after just three years, before the birth of a third daughter, and later lived in Thomas's house, possibly as his housekeeper, with two surviving daughters, Eleanor and Margaret. She predeceased Thomas but her burial has not been traced.<br>
<br>Tompion's nephew, Thomas junior, was apprenticed in the Clockmakers' Company to Charles Kemp, probably one of Tompion's workmen, in April 1694. He was freed in 1702 but none of his work has been positively identified and it is clear that he did not have the character to emulate his uncle, under whose will he was excused debts, inherited the Ickwell property, and had a moderate sum invested on his behalf. It was all to no avail; he went on trial at the Old Bailey with his wife, Anne, in November 1720 for stealing 11 guineas, and was described as of bad character and was alleged to have run a brothel for a number of years.<br>
<br>In December 1694 Tompion's niece Margaret Kent married Edward Banger, a Tompion apprentice of west country extraction bound in 1687 and freed in July 1695. About 1701 Tompion took Banger into a partnership which failed about 1708. Banger left and was scathingly denied any bequest in Tompion's will made five years later. He continued in the trade and several clocks and watches bearing his name alone are recorded; he died intestate and was buried at St Botolph without Bishopsgate on 12 December 1719. The burial of Margaret Banger, generously provided for under Tompion's will, has not been traced.<br>
<br>Thomas's niece Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1687) was just seventeen when she married George Graham, aged about thirty-one, in London in 1704. Graham had been apprenticed in July 1688 to a London clockmaker, Henry Aske, was made free in September 1695, and probably joined Tompion as a journeyman soon after. The marriage and Graham's character, highly commendable by all accounts, led Tompion to take Graham into partnership about 1711 and this arrangement lasted until Tompion's death.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandinfluence"></a>Final years and influence</h2>It is not known when Tompion ceased practical work. He resorted to Bath, presumably finding the waters beneficial to an ailment, and the Pump Room's fine equation timepiece presented by him about 1709 is believed to have been in gratitude. He died on 20 November 1713 and was accorded the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey on 25 November, in the centre of the nave. In 1751 Graham was interred in the same grave and his name added to Tompion's stone. In his will dated 21 October 1713 Tompion named Graham and former cotenant Michael Tesmond as executors. He made bequests to relatives and friends but the business and the residue of his personal estate passed to George and Elizabeth Graham.<br>
<br>No description of Tompion's physical stature or of his personality is known but Kneller's half-length portrait of him wearing buttoned jacket and neck-scarf, probably painted in the late 1680s, shows him with an open, honest, genial face with full lips and clear skin, with shoulder-length hair, or perhaps a wig, with locks and curls.<br>
<br>Several factors account for Tompion's extraordinary rise to the forefront of London's horological community within only a decade of setting up business in 1671. Primarily, it must have been his metalworking skills together with his innovative reappraisal of all aspects of his trade which appealed to the likes of Hooke and Moore, but his success also owes something to the favourable circumstances existing at the time of his appearance in the City, ten years after the Restoration and the formation of the Royal Society, and five years after the great fire. London's rebuilding and repopulation were advancing fast and science and commerce were demanding better timekeepers from a trade which, like the City, was in the throes of drastic change. The pendulum had been introduced only twelve years earlier, the recoil escapement had just been conceived, and the balance-spring for watches was about to divert every watchmaker's thoughts. The time was ripe for experimentation and the stage was set for a surge in pioneering work.<br>
<br>Tompion's association with Hooke and Moore afforded him the opportunity to express his skills, ideas, and potential, and as a consequence, and more importantly to one with high aspirations, the opportunity to come to the notice of &eacute;lite and influential members of society, and so to establish a reputation. One key to his great success lay in his business acumen, that is, in his ability to capitalize on that reputation by organizing batch production to meet demand. The serial numbers on surviving items are the only evidence of the ledger accounting system, whatever its nature, used to keep a check on production. Tompion's primary aims, even in cheaper items, were durability and accuracy, with the work being executed in as substantial or delicate a manner as was required. His appreciation of metals and their qualities, of the uses of springs, of efficiently profiled gearing, and of neat and precise finishing all resulted in the production of mechanisms of better and more reliable quality than any which preceded them. From his contributions grew a tradition of highest quality workmanship which was passed on by Graham to a third generation which included the likes of Thomas Mudge (1715&#150;1794).<br>
<br>The business ran under Tompion's name (including the partnership periods) for forty-two years during which time about 800 clocks and 5000 watches of various description and function were sold, as well as dozens of scientific instruments&#151;quadrants, barometers, pocket dials, and horizontal garden sundials. His business set the highest standards and doubtless he took great pride in the fact that none of his contemporaries achieved such consistently fine quality in such a wide range of products. His sobriquet &#145;the father of English watchmaking&#146; was well-merited.<br>
