</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Poel <span class="st"> [Pole]</span>,  William</span>  (1852&#150;1934), <span class="occ">actor, director, and author</span>, was born at 3 Storey's Gate, Westminster, London, on 22 July 1852, the third son and fourth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22463/', "William Pole (1814&#150;1900)")</script>, an accomplished engineer and musician, and his wife, Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1900), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10461/', "Henry Gauntlett (1762&#150;1833)")</script>, vicar of Olney, and the sister of the famous organist H. J. Gauntlett (1805&#150;1876).<br>
<br>The young William was influenced by his father's admiration for the Pre-Raphaelites and by other family members' artistic sensibilities. His youthful, graceful features induced Holman Hunt to paint him as Christ in <span class="italic">The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple</span> (Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery) and Sir F. W. Burton to paint him as <span class="italic">L'&eacute;cuyer</span> (Victoria and Albert Museum). Poor health denied him a formal education: he was tutored privately and never attended university. At the age of seventeen he was apprenticed to the building contractors Lucas Brothers, where he enjoyed the craftsmanship but loathed the office work. At the late age of twenty, he saw <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>&#151;his further attendance was inhibited by his posting to Lucas Brothers' Sussex office.<h2>
<a name="Becominganactor"></a>Becoming an actor</h2>Pole returned to London in 1873 and resumed theatregoing. He rejected Henry Irving's famed production of <span class="italic">The Bells</span> as blatantly sensational; more appealing to him was Charles Mathews's natural, graceful work in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Critic</span>. He was further impressed by visiting French companies, whose actors obeyed the rhythm of words, the reverse of Irving's practice with Shakespeare. Equally inspiring was Tommaso Salvini's performance as Othello at Drury Lane (1875), because Salvini studied the text scrupulously. Pole was possibly a supernumerary for Salvini, although when is unclear.<br>
<br>After an abortive attempt to go on the stage in 1875, Pole joined Charles Mathews's company at Bristol in February 1876. When his original name was mis-spelt on a programme as Poel, he adopted the error permanently, possibly to spare his father, who had objected emphatically to his son's theatrical ambitions. Poel deliberately sought the regimen of provincial touring in order to study the stage closely; he was a general utility actor in Dublin and Liverpool, and then toured with Osmond Tearle for the remainder of 1876. For nine months in 1877 he was with James Scott's fit-up company, which led a precarious existence and frequently did not have sufficient funds even to rent a hall for performances: indeed, Poel's adventures with Scott around Yorkshire make for Dickensian reading. He rounded out his theatrical education with lessons from Edward Stirling and Edward Terry in London. By winter 1878 he was again touring the provinces, giving solo recitals.<h2>
<a name="InterestinperformingShakespeare"></a>Interest in performing Shakespeare</h2>By now, perhaps influenced by the bare-bones experience with Scott's company, Poel believed that Shakespeare's plays were harmed by the proscenium arch, realistic sets, and extended intervals. He thought Shakespeare should be performed under Elizabethan conditions which encouraged the audience's own imaginative powers. This vision dominated Poel's life; he was oblivious of differing opinions, and was frequently dubbed an eccentric. In June 1879 he formed his own company, the Elizabethans, which gave costume recitals around England during the summer months. Its repertory comprised scenes from Shakespeare and the English classics. Performances were simple, convincing Poel that the text was pre-eminent and that Shakespeare had become obscured by self-serving theatrical practices. This led him, in 1880, to correspond with F. J. Furnivall, the president of the New Shakspere Society, about the text of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. Poel conjectured that the first quarto edition was an intentional acting version, a theory which could be sustained through performance. The latter was given on 16 April 1881 at St George's Hall, London, where Poel employed a draped but otherwise bare platform stage. The cast, with Poel as Hamlet, comprised amateurs, including Maud Holt (later Lady Tree) as Ophelia. The audience was not particularly sympathetic, while the critics, cruelly derogatory, stressed the enterprise's experimental and educational aspects. Poel's understanding of Elizabethan staging was immature, but he had studied the text carefully to elicit what performance requirements the play manifested, and he eschewed innovation and startling effects. However, this obscure <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> production failed to impress.<h2>
<a name="Furthertheatricalexperience"></a>Further theatrical experience</h2>Poel widened his experience from October 1881 until Christmas 1883 as manager of the Royal Victoria Hall and Coffee Tavern (later the Old Vic Theatre), Emma Cons's experiment to provide a respectable, teetotal place of amusement at reasonable prices. Poel was effective in reducing expenses, maintaining the tone of the amusements, and attracting larger audiences. In 1884 he gained valuable experience as stage manager of F. R. Benson's touring company. Benson also bought his adaptation of W. D. Howells's novel <span class="italic">A Foregone Conclusion</span>, which, as <span class="italic">Priest or Painter</span>, was first performed at the Olympic, London (1884). Like Poel's other plays, it was never particularly successful, although Benson included it in his 1886 and 1887 seasons at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon.<br>
<br>After leaving Benson, Poel formed the Little Comedies company in 1885 to give recitals and one-act plays at various private events. The company, which variously included Kate Rorke, Rosina Filippi, and Elizabeth Robins, was enlarged in April 1888 to include Frederick Berlyn as Poel's partner. The repertory included six playlets and eleven adaptations by Poel, none of which, perhaps surprisingly, was at all highbrow.<h2>
<a name="ReadingandspeakingShakespeare"></a>Reading and speaking Shakespeare</h2>Poel was also affiliated with the Shakespeare Reading Society, founded in 1875 by students at University College, London, with Henry Irving as its first president. He was appointed instructor in 1887 and remained with the society until 1897. Intense preparation preceded each of the society's staged readings of minimally edited plays without act and scene divisions. The readings, occasionally costumed, were given at various halls and institutes in London, which emphasized their adult educational purpose.<br>
<br>By now, Poel believed that Shakespeare's speeches should be spoken rapidly, with proper inflection but exaggerated emphasis. For this theory he was indebted to Samuel Brandram (1824&#150;1892), who could recite entire Shakespeare plays from memory. Poel also theorized that the original sound of Elizabethan plays could be captured through &#145;tuned tones&#146; and key words in each speech. He was vague in defining these tones or tunes, although they were a form of inflection. He preferred working with amateurs, particularly women, because he believed their voices were more flexible than, and without the ingrained habits of, professionals. He quickly dismissed any actor who could not &#145;take the tones&#146; he drilled into every cast. Lewis Casson, in several Poel productions, was adept at demonstrating Poel's principles, while Elsie Fogerty (1865&#150;1945), another Poel performer, developed her elocution theories from him at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art (where Laurence Olivier was an early pupil).<br>
<br>The apogee of the Reading Society's achievement was a performance of <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> (1893), for which the stage of the Royalty was converted to resemble the Fortune Theatre of Shakespeare's day. However, the ultimate effect created was still of one stage picture within another. Nor, despite his commitment to textual integrity, could Poel overcome his puritanical Victorianism, as he excised all the play's bawdry: for example, he changed &#145;he has got a wench with child&#146; to &#145;he will shortly be a father&#146;.<h2>
<a name="MarriageandtheElizabethanStageSociety"></a>Marriage and the Elizabethan Stage Society</h2>On 28 April 1894 Poel married Ella Constance Locock (<i>c</i>.1862&#150;1950), the eldest daughter of Revd Alfred Locock (<i>d</i>. 1923) of Putney Heath. She had considerable intellectual powers and was an accomplished musician. Although an invalid for many years, she assisted and encouraged Poel in his work; their only daughter died before Poel. In 1894 Poel also founded the Elizabethan Stage Society, a development of the Shakespeare Reading Society. Before its dissolution in 1905, the society gave thirty productions of plays by Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and some modern playwrights.<br>
<br>For the society's first production of <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, at Burlington Hall (21 June 1895), Poel purchased a valuable wardrobe of Elizabethan costumes and asked Arnold Dolmetsch, the researcher of early music and instruments, to provide authentic music. (Interestingly, for a 1897 revival, Poel conceived each role in the singing range: for example, Malvolio as a baritone, Sir Andrew a falsetto.) The 1895 production, however, provoked the first of several attacks from William Archer, who found the society's acting amateurish, but who did recognize that Poel had rescued Shakespeare from inappropriately elaborate scenery and spectacle. Archer was dubious about using Elizabethan costumes, which would be decidedly anachronistic in, say, <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>. In fact, Poel often ignored anachronisms, as when he incorporated Schubert's music into <span class="italic">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</span> later that year. This play was to attain distinction in 1910 when Herbert Beerbohm Tree, usually antagonistic to Poel, surprisingly invited him to contribute to the annual Shakespeare festival at His Majesty's. The revival featured a stage extended over the orchestra pit, and included in its production staff were two subsequent adherents, William Bridges-Adams and Nugent Monck. On this occasion A. B. Walkley thought some of the Elizabethan conventions quaint, but that Poel had captured the play's atmosphere. Poel also received support from Bernard Shaw, who found <span class="italic">The Comedy of Errors</span> (1895) delightful and the amateurs quite good.<br>
<br>When Poel tackled other dramatists the results were equally mixed. He liked Marlowe's <span class="italic">Dr Faustus</span>, but, again contrary to his avowed principles, did not hesitate to cut and rearrange the middle section, which he considered weak structurally. The play was performed on a reproduction of the Fortune stage within St George's Hall in July 1896. Again Shaw praised the result, declaring Poel's the only way to stage Elizabethan drama. A production of Poel's adaptation of <span class="italic">Arden of Feversham</span> in 1897 was unsuccessful. Poel pared down the text of John Ford's <span class="italic">The Broken Heart</span> (1898) and employed semi-classical costumes. With well-acted leading roles, the production avoided the often-made charges of pedantry. More success followed in 1899 with Jonson's <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>, the tight text of which required little alteration.<br>
<br>Poel turned to contemporary drama in 1899 with his production of Swinburne's <span class="italic">Locrine</span>, which failed because of Swinburne's verse and the cast's rendition of it. In comparison, and despite a philistine audience, Milton's <span class="italic">Samson Agonistes</span> was a success in 1900; the piece was recited rather than acted, but a strong pictorialism was still conveyed. Poel had produced it because he believed drama should educate rather than merely entertain, and he took it subsequently to Manchester, Bedford, and Cambridge. His range also embraced Calderon's <span class="italic">La vida es sue&ntilde;o</span> and K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa's Hindu classic <span class="italic">Sakuntal&aacute;</span> (both 1899).<br>
<br>The death of his mother in 1900 preyed on Poel's mind, for he had been a devoted son. The outcome was his most successful and money-making venture, the morality play <span class="italic">Everyman</span>. Although it was finally produced in the Master's Court of the Charterhouse on 13 July 1901, he had tried first to use Westminster Abbey and then Canterbury Cathedral, but was denied permission. After the initial two performances Poel revived it in Oxford and Brighton, and in July 1902 presented it for a month at the Imperial Theatre, London. Afterwards he frequently toured it in numerous provincial cities with Philip Ben Greet as his partner. The play brought Poel (who played Adonai) instant recognition, and his seriousness and simplicity of method, together with his ingenuity and discretion, were received enthusiastically.<br>
<br>Despite the financial and artistic success of <span class="italic">Everyman</span>, the Elizabethan Stage Society continued to lose money. Its last production was <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (1905), which was notable for the casting of teenagers as Romeo and Juliet (Esm&eacute; Percy and Dorothy Minto). Thereafter, the society's assets were auctioned.<h2>
<a name="Laterproductions"></a>Later productions</h2>Poel remained undefeated. In 1906 he visited America to promote tours of <span class="italic">Everyman</span> given by Ben Greet. Later that year he undertook the role of Father Keegan in Shaw's <span class="italic">John Bull's other Island</span>, and impressed Shaw deeply. Shakespeare was never far away. Ben Iden Payne (1881&#150;1976), the director of Annie Horniman's new Gaiety Theatre in Manchester, invited him to stage the little-performed and controversial <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> as the inaugural production on 11 April 1908. C. E. Montague of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> praised both Poel's performance of Angelo and the overall production, which was taken to Stratford ten days later. The following year Poel produced a <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> notable for a feminine, humanized Lady Macbeth and the innovation of Duncan replacing Banquo as the second apparition, which Bridges-Adams adopted. Much less successful was the 1912 <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>. Poel cut the text insensitively, ignoring the play's poetry, and cast females as Aeneas, Paris, and Thersites, the last played as a clown with a Scottish accent. However, he discovered Edith Evans (then a milliner), who made her first London stage appearance as Cressida. In 1914 he revisited <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> for the third time, rearranging the text to mirror the English political conditions of 1600. More successful was his 1924 staging of <span class="italic">Fratricide Punished</span>, an Elizabethan burlesque version of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>.<br>
<br>The Elizabethan Stage Society was resurrected in 1927 as the Elizabethan Stage Circle, founded specifically to produce a play on a full-sized platform stage. This was built inside the Holborn Empire, where the stage extended out over the stalls. Characteristically, Poel chose a play of dubious dramatic merit, Samuel Rowley's <span class="italic">When you See me, you Know me</span>, because of its relevance to the contemporary controversy over the revision of the prayer book. Later, in 1931, the circle produced <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>, which was notable for the eccentricities in costuming Poel employed: Coriolanus wore a leopard skin, Volumnia a Gainsborough dress, and Virgilia a Pre-Raphaelite dress, while the citizens were clothed as French railway porters.<h2>
<a name="Otheractivitieshonoursanddeath"></a>Other activities, honours, and death</h2>When not producing plays, Poel was a fervent polemicist, and wrote countless articles, letters to the press, and books, including <span class="italic">Shakespeare in the Theatre</span> (1913), <span class="italic">What's Wrong with the Stage?</span> (1920), and <span class="italic">Monthly Letters of William Poel</span> (1929). Always on the theatrical fringe himself, he frequently attacked the commercial theatre for suppressing good productions. He fought against the censor, believing public opinion provided sufficient control. He complained about speculation in theatre rents, and inveighed against long runs, which tied up theatres and were bad for actors. He thought provincial repertory theatres provided good training, particularly for a national theatre, which he supported ardently. One cherished goal was to build a replica of the Globe Theatre as a memorial to Shakespeare, which only became a reality more than sixty years after his death.<br>
<br>There were, too, honours and recognition. Harley Granville-Barker (who had played Richard II for Poel in 1899 and who embodied Poel's theories in his <span class="italic">Prefaces to Shakespeare</span>), along with numerous distinguished guests, assembled on 1 December 1912 for a dinner at the Trocadero to honour Poel. In spring 1916 he was an invited lecturer in the drama department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, and he returned there the same autumn to direct Jonson's <span class="italic">The Poetaster</span>. In 1924 he received a &pound;300 grant (the largest possible) from the Royal Society of Literature and a &pound;100 civil-list pension. In 1929 he petulantly declined a knighthood because he would not share an honour conferred on other actors with whose staging practices his own disagreed. His eightieth birthday was celebrated with a portrait commissioned from Henry Tonks as Keegan in <span class="italic">John Bull's other Island</span>, which captures him well. He saw Gielgud's Hamlet in November 1934. Shortly afterwards he contracted bronchitis, and he died at his home, 85 Howard's Lane, Putney, on 13 December 1934. He was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
<br>Poel's greatest contribution was to the modern tradition of staging Shakespeare, which was founded on his ideas. Harley Granville-Barker, W. Bridges-Adams, Robert Atkins, Tyrone Guthrie, Nugent Monck, John Gielgud, and countless directors have been influenced, knowingly or unconsciously, by him. Ironically, Poel is remembered more for what people think he achieved than what he actually accomplished. He was right in his vision of how the principles of Elizabethan staging could be applied in the modern theatre, but his cranky perfectionism made him the wrong person to implement it.<br>
