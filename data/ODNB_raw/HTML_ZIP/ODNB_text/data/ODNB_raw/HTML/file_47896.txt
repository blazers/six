<span class="headword">Marcroft,  William</span>  (1822&#150;1894), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist and company promoter</span>, was born on 15 July 1822 at Box Cottage, Fog Lane, Middleton, Lancashire, the illegitimate son of Sally Marcroft (1801&#150;1841), a farm servant, and Richard Howarth, a weaver. Shortly after his birth he and his mother moved to Heywood, where she eventually married Jacob Aspinal, a weaver. William Marcroft was put to work at the age of six gathering dung on the local turnpike road. Eighteen months later he became a piecer at a Heywood cotton mill, where he remained until he was twelve. He was then apprenticed to a fustian cutter, but left after three years to work as a piecer again before joining Charles Mills's machine-making works in Heywood, where he became a grinder. Shortly after his marriage on 3 March 1844 to Jane Smith, daughter of David Smith, a local brewer, he moved to Oldham, where he worked in Hibbert and Platt's great machine-making works, eventually being promoted to foreman.<br>
<br>Marcroft appears to have had no formal education and his early attempts to educate himself (he attended John Plant's night school in Heywood about 1837) were frustrated by the need to nurse his mother, whose health had collapsed as a result of constant childbearing and poverty. After her death in 1841 he attended night school at the Heywood Mechanics' Institute, where for a time he was an assistant teacher. On arriving in Oldham, he joined the Oddfellows, Rechabites, and the Machine Grinders' Society (of which he was local secretary), attended Chartist meetings, and became an active supporter of W. J. Fox, the radical MP for Oldham between 1847 and 1863. He later wrote of this period that &#145;my doings in life were become loose&#146;  (Marcroft, <span class="italic">Inner Circle</span>, 15), but after hearing a temperance lecturer he became an ardent teetotaller for the remainder of his life. His earnings at Hibbert and Platt were about &pound;2 a week, and he was determined to save half of this until he had &pound;1000; he would then retire from an arduous and unhealthy occupation. He refused to lend money to neighbours and discouraged the visits of former friends to his house, which behaviour made him so unpopular that he was forced to move home several times.<br>
<br>The collapse of Chartism in 1848 and the defeat of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in the 1852 lock-out convinced him that the co-operative movement offered the best hope for the working classes. He was accordingly a promoter of the Oldham Industrial Co-operative Society in 1850, and sat on the board of the Co-operative Wholesale Society in 1865, and 1867&#150;71. Above all, however, he was a vigorous advocate of co-operative production, whereby the workers in an establishment held the share capital and received a bonus on profits. In 1857 he helped to promote the Oldham Building and Manufacturing Company Ltd, and when it appeared on the point of failure suggested that it should build the Sun Mill, which eventually would have 90,000 self-acting mule spindles, an extremely large number for that period. While the mill was being built he served as clerk of works and treasurer, having left Hibbert and Platt in 1861 with his &pound;1000 saved, though for a time he may also have practised as a dentist, a profession he had taught himself to supplement his wages. He served as a director of the company in 1859&#150;61, 1862&#150;4, 1865&#150;71, and 1875&#150;7, and as chairman in 1866&#150;7. More than anybody he was responsible for what, as the Sun Mill Company Ltd, was a brilliant success and a model for the Oldham cotton industry. His years with the company, however, were marked by frequent clashes with the other directors, principal servants, and shareholders. In part this was because they increasingly regarded the company as an ordinary commercial concern (in 1867 only four out of over 1000 shareholders worked there). But it was also a consequence of Marcroft's difficult personality. Blunt of speech and contemptuous of anyone who did not share his ideals, he became obsessed with plots against him. Nevertheless his contribution to the co-operative movement was remarkable for he also helped to promote the Oldham Co-operative Insurance Society (1867), the Oldham House and Mill Company Ltd (1867), the Star Corn Mill (1868), the Central Mill Company Ltd (1871), the Federative Insurance Company Ltd (1875), the Oldham Limited Liability Association (1875), and the Cotton Buying Company Ltd (1881). He also became a prolific author, producing several autobiographical works, a history of the Sun Mill Company, and large numbers of pamphlets and articles on co-operative production.<br>
<br>Marcroft had four sons and two daughters (one of whom died aged four in 1862). His considerable business acumen and thrift allowed him and his family to live in some comfort, despite simple food and home-made clothing, and to travel widely throughout the British Isles, the continent, and the USA. The death of his wife on 18 April 1882, shortly after that of his surviving daughter, Emma, in childbirth, clearly unnerved him. He abandoned plans to establish a co-operative village with a cotton mill, sold off his property and shares, and retired for a time to Southport. He died at his home, 85 Roman Road, Failsworth, Lancashire, on 8 September 1894, and was buried in Oldham on 14 September. By then he was very much an anachronism, not only in his old-fashioned forms of speech, but also in his belief in the principles of co-operative production.<br>
