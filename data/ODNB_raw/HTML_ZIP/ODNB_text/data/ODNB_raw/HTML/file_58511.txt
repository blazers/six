<span class="headword">Maxwell, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1875&#150;1935), <span class="occ">banker and army officer</span>, was born in Belfast, the son of William Maxwell. He was educated in Dublin and entered the civil service in 1893, and then transferred to the Post Office. In 1901 he married Eva, younger daughter of R. W. Jones of Belfast. In 1905 he took the unusual step of becoming joint secretary of the private bankers Glyn Mills &amp; Co., who rarely recruited to senior positions from outside. This move may well have been prompted by the bank's use of numerical calculating machinery for cheque clearing (and in its expanding corporate registrar's business), equipment with which Maxwell would have been familiar at the Post Office.<br>
<br>Like many of his colleagues in the bank, Maxwell was a territorial soldier, and when war was declared in 1914 he went to France with the 8th London regiment. He was soon promoted lieutenant-colonel commanding the 8th and 23rd regiments. He was awarded the DSO in 1916 for his part in an action in which he was severely wounded. On his return to the front he was later promoted to be general officer commanding the 174th infantry brigade with the rank of brigadier-general. He served throughout the war in the trenches on the western front, being mentioned in dispatches five times, and winning a bar to his DSO in 1918; he was created CMG in 1919. He commanded the 2nd London infantry brigade, TA, from 1920 to 1924 and was honorary colonel of the 7th London regiment, the Post Office Rifles, from 1923 until his death.<br>
<br>When Maxwell returned to Glyn Mills, the most able of the new generation of partners had been killed, notably Charles Mills MP in 1915. General Sir Herbert Lawrence became a managing partner in 1919 and looked to Maxwell, who was appointed general manager, to help him pilot the bank through the turbulent financial world of the early 1920s. Lawrence, who was related by marriage to the bank's owning families, provided the reassurance that was vital to the success of mergers with other long-established private banks. In 1923 Glyn Mills amalgamated with Holts, a West End bank, which acted principally as army agent. Maxwell became a managing partner in the enlarged business. Within a year he was negotiating with the executors of the earl of Jersey for the acquisition of Child's, one of the oldest private banks in the City. The two banks amalgamated in March 1924 and for the rest of his career Maxwell had to manage a large unwieldy partnership.<br>
<br>As well as private clients Glyn Mills also had commercial customers, including the armaments manufacturer Vickers and the Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., owners of the White Star Line. When Vickers's capital was reduced in 1926 and the management reorganized, Lawrence was appointed chairman of the company. He immediately became deeply involved in all the problems of the armaments industry of the inter-war years, leaving Glyn Mills very much in Maxwell's hands. During 1926 Maxwell was himself plunged into the complex negotiations that eventually resulted in the sale of Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. to Lord Kylsant's Royal Mail group. When it became clear in the early summer of 1930 that the group was in serious financial difficulties, Maxwell was a natural choice to join Frederick Hyde and Sir William McLintock as a member of the committee of inquiry and a voting trustee with complete authority over the enormous enterprise. Maxwell's formidable task was to maintain close communications with leading figures in the City, including Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, informing them at every stage of the delicate negotiations to resolve the country's largest single corporate exposure. As Maxwell well knew, success was vital, as failure would have placed in jeopardy not just thousands of jobs but several financial institutions. For the next five years most of his time was taken up with Royal Mail and he was knighted in 1931 for his services.<br>
<br>After the first phase of the rescue was completed in 1933, Maxwell and McLintock joined the boards of nearly all the leading companies in the group&#151;Royal Mail itself, Elder Dempster, Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., Coast Lines, Shaw Savill, and many others. Helped and encouraged by Norman they were charged with realizing the group's assets on behalf of the creditors. This was a hugely complicated undertaking, which at any moment could have been jeopardized by the hasty action of any one of the very large number of small creditors, many of whom were unsecured. Between 1933 and 1935 a succession of schemes were drafted and tested on City opinion by Maxwell, McLintock, and Norman; this involved hundreds of meetings and the skilful handling of the press and the courts. There is no doubt that this frantic activity, coupled with the day-to-day management of what was still the largest shipping combine in the world, contributed to Maxwell's sudden death on 20 January 1935 at 16 Cumberland Terrace, Regent's Park, London. He was survived by his wife. He was buried at St Mary's, Finchley.<br>
<br>As someone who had come to the City from an unusual background, Maxwell was convinced of the importance of evening classes and of professional training. He was appointed a governor of the City of London College in 1911, and he chaired the general purposes committee from 1922 and became chairman of the governors in 1934. He also served as a member of the advisory committee on commercial education of the Regent Street Polytechnic and as a member of the Board of Education's committee on examinations for part-time students, and on the London county council's advisory committee on banking education. He was president of the Institute of Bankers from 1931 to 1932. Maxwell and his wife had a daughter and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50546/', "Arthur Terence Maxwell (1905&#150;1991)")</script>, who became a partner in Glyn Mills and helped with the Royal Mail reconstruction; he himself had a distinguished career as a banker and industrialist.<br>
<br>Along with many of his contemporaries in the City, Maxwell of necessity worked discreetly behind the scenes, shunning the limelight; yet without such commitment the experience of the inter-war years would have been even more catastrophic. The financial problems they sought to resolve were so great that the simple panacea of devaluing sterling advocated by Keynes would have made little impact.<br>
