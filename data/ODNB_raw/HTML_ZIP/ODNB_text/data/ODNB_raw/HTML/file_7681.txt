<span class="headword">Dircks,  Henry</span>  (1806&#150;1873), <span class="occ">historian of technology</span>, was born at Liverpool on 26 August 1806, the eldest son of Egbert Dircks, a bookkeeper, of 14 Burnswick Road, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nightingale. As a boy Henry was apprenticed to a mercantile company in Liverpool. He educated himself in practical mechanics, chemical science, and general literature. Before the age of twenty-one he was lecturing on chemistry and electricity, and publishing articles in the <span class="italic">Mechanics Magazine</span> and other journals. During the 1830s he was involved in the Liverpool Mechanics' Institute (established 1825), and urged such institutes to co-operate with literary institutions. Dircks was a friend of the instrument maker John Benjamin Dancer. In 1837 he became a life member of the British Association, and regularly contributed to its proceedings. He and his wife, Mary, who were married in the early 1830s, had at least one child. Their son William Egbert was baptized on 24 July 1835 at St Nicholas, Liverpool.<br>
<br>Dircks left the mercantile company to become a practical engineer supervising railway, canal, and mining works, but by the early 1840s was settled in London, describing himself as a consulting engineer. Between 1840 and 1857 he took out patents for several inventions, but no engineering works of any significance are credited to him.<br>
<br>Dircks is best-known for publications in the history of technology. In Liverpool he had disputed the claims of Thomas Spencer, a carver and gilder, to have invented electrotyping, which Dircks claimed had been plagiarized from a London printer, C. J. Jordan. Dircks used increasingly abusive letters in the <span class="italic">Mechanics Magazine</span> to pursue his attack. He summarized his crusade in two books, <span class="italic">Jordantype, Otherwise Called Electrotype</span> (1852) and <span class="italic">Contributions towards a History of Electro-Metallurgy</span> (1863). Dircks's two-volume history of attempts to construct perpetual motion machines (1861 and 1870) is still useful. This interest in investigating the reality of invention was continued in three works on the inventions of the marquess of Worcester 
    (Edward Somerset, 1601&#150;1667)
  , which were well received. Dircks invented his own optical delusion, intended as an illustration of Dickens's &#145;haunted man&#146;, which was exhibited at the London Polytechnic under the name of &#145;Pepper's ghost&#146;; he described this in a notice to the British Association in 1858. Dircks sought to develop what he called nature study as a literary technique for improving poetry and sacred songs (1869, 1871, 1872).<br>
<br>Dircks joined the Royal Society of Literature, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1867). In 1868 he procured the title of LLD from the so-called college of Tusculum in Tennessee, USA. Styled a gentleman on his death certificate, and leaving several thousand pounds, Dircks died in the New Ship Hotel, Ship Street, Brighton, on 17 September 1873.<br>
