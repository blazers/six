<span class="headword">Williams,  William Mattieu</span>  (1820&#150;1892), <span class="occ">science teacher and industrial chemist</span>, son of Abraham Williams, a Welsh fishmonger working in London, and his wife, Louise, daughter of Gabriel Mattieu, a Swiss refugee, was born in London on 6 February 1820. His father died when he was an infant and his mother married again when he was four. After an elementary education in three schools he was apprenticed, in 1834, to Thomas Street, mathematical and optical instrument maker in Lambeth. Although Williams worked from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. he found time to attend evening classes in the sciences (including phrenology of which he became a lifelong devotee) at the London Mechanics' Institution in Southampton buildings, Chancery Lane.<br>
<br>In 1841, on his coming of age, Williams inherited a sum of money from his father, and, his apprenticeship being over, he passed two years at Edinburgh University (though there is no evidence that he took a degree), followed by a similar period walking through Europe, paying his way by working as an artisan. He spent much time in Switzerland, Italy (where he formed a dislike of the Austrian autocratic government), Greece, and Turkey (where he formed a high opinion of the Turks). Back in Britain he returned to Edinburgh to study medicine at the Royal Infirmary, but proved too sensitive to become a surgeon. Reverting to his trade, he established himself as an electrical instrument maker and electrotyper in Hatton Garden, London. He developed a small consultancy dealing with patents and giving advice to railway companies. He also delivered lectures about his continental tour to audiences in different parts of the country, as well as lecturing on other subjects (including phrenology) at the Mechanics' Institution, where he was a member of the management committee. He played a major role in persuading that body to accept William Ellis's offer of money to found a school, which, as the Birkbeck School, opened on 17 July 1848. The immediate success of this school led George Combe (whom Williams had met while in Edinburgh), with the financial aid of Ellis, to found a similar institution in Edinburgh. Williams volunteered to undertake the headmastership, and it was opened on 4 December 1848 under the title of Williams Secular School in the Trades' Hall, Infirmary Street. Experimental science formed an important part of the school's curriculum. Owing to the rapid increase in its numbers the school was relocated in the former anatomical school of Robert Knox at 1 Surgeons' Square. However, the school, and especially its secular nature, attracted considerable criticism to which Williams responded robustly with his pamphlet <span class="italic">Who should Teach Christianity to Children&#151;the School Masters or the Clergy?</span> (1853).<br>
<br>The school closed in 1854 when Williams became, on the recommendation of Lyon Playfair, master of the science classes in the recently opened Birmingham and Midland Institute. Williams delivered his opening lecture on 17 August 1854 and in 1856 he introduced the institute penny lectures, which were a marked success; he also contributed popular articles on science to <span class="italic">The Birmingham Journal</span>. In 1857 he became acquainted with the Italian patriot Felice Orsini whom he instructed in the manufacturing of explosives, some of which Orsini and Pieri used in their attempt to assassinate Napoleon III. Though placed under surveillance by the French secret service, Williams was able to convince the authorities of his innocence in any complicity regarding the attempt.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1859 Williams married Alice (<i>b</i>. 1835/6), eldest daughter of Joseph Baker, surveyor, of Birmingham. They had at least two sons. One, named after George Combe, became a professor of music; the other, Arnold Winhelried, became a doctor. While in Birmingham Williams turned his attention to chemistry, being elected a fellow of the Chemical Society in 1857. In particular he worked on the manufacture of paraffin. This work led to a career change by his becoming, in 1863, an industrial chemist when he was appointed manager of the Leeswood Oil Company, Caergwrle, Flintshire. After the decline of the Welsh oil distilling industry following the discovery of oil wells in America, Williams went to Sheffield in 1868 as chemist to the Atlas Iron Works. In Sheffield he wrote <span class="italic">The Fuel of the Sun</span> (1870) in which he advanced a heterodox view of the source of the sun's energy largely unaware of the principles of thermodynamics as they had been worked out since the 1840s, although he did cite Joule's mechanical equivalent of heat.<br>
<br>In 1870 Williams returned to London to devote his time to scientific writing, teaching (in various schools) and lecturing. Elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1872 he does not seem to have played an active part in its proceedings. He delivered a Friday evening discourse on Count Rumford at the Royal Institution in 1871 and the Cantor lectures of the Society of Arts in 1876 and 1878. His subjects there were &#145;Iron and steel manufacture&#146; and &#145;mathematical instruments&#146; respectively. He was manager of the Polytechnic Institution during its last six months of existence at the end of 1881. His writing included scientific articles to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> during the 1880s and books such as <span class="italic">The Science of Cookery</span> (1884) and <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Clothing</span> (1890). On the death of his step-uncle, Zachariah Watkins, early in 1889, Williams was freed from financial worries, and began what he described as his life work, the <span class="italic">Vindication of Phrenology</span>. While revising the proofs he died suddenly of a stroke at his home, The Grange, Neasden, on 28 November 1892; the book was published in 1894. He was survived by his wife.<br>
