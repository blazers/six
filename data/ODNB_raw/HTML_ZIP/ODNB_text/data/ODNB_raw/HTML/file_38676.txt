<span class="headword">Du Val,  Charles Henry</span>  (1846&#150;1889), <span class="occ">entertainer</span>, was born at Platt Terrace, Rusholme, Manchester, on 27 October 1846, the youngest child and only son of Irish parents, John Du Val, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Eliza Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murray. He was educated in Manchester and articled to a solicitor, but abandoned the law in 1864 to join Oldham repertory theatre. In 1865 he went to Dublin, where he devised and presented the first version of his one-man show <span class="italic">Odds and Ends</span>. A handsome man of middle height with brown wavy hair, he had a pleasant tenor voice, danced nimbly, and could mimic any accent: his impersonation of female characters was widely admired. He was adept at political satire and could hold the stage alone for two hours, provoking almost continual laughter. He wrote his own material, words, and music, and toured Ireland and Britain for more than ten years.<br>
<br>On 9 May 1877 Du Val married Mary (Minnie) Dorcas Burke (1848&#150;1914), the daughter of George Courtney Burke, a merchant, of Cork, at Christ Church, Dublin. They had one daughter and a son who died in infancy. Following a serious illness, possibly tuberculosis, Du Val decided to take his show to South Africa, and set sail in November 1879. He was also acting as a special correspondent for the <span class="italic">Weekly Irish Times</span>. After a season in Cape Town, the Du Vals travelled throughout the country; Minnie, who was pregnant, returned to Ireland from Port Elizabeth. Du Val and his manager continued the tour, reaching Pretoria on 18 November 1880, where they were trapped by the Anglo-Transvaal War in the siege of the city until April 1881. Du Val joined the Pretoria Carabiniers and saw service in several engagements; he also edited the <span class="italic">News of the Camp</span>. After the siege was lifted he completed his tour, and arrived back in Dublin in October 1881. He resumed his performances and also lectured on his experiences in the war. His book <span class="italic">With a Show through Southern Africa</span> (1882) sold 25,000 copies in the first few weeks.<br>
<br>In April 1883 Du Val made his London d&eacute;but with his one-man show and was engaged for a short season at the Lesser St James's Hall, Piccadilly. It was so successful that he was brought back on 24 September in the Grand Hall, where he gave 431 consecutive performances, seen by more than half a million people. On 7 July 1884 he gave a command performance for the prince and princess of Wales.<br>
<br>Du Val returned to South Africa in July 1885, but finding it deep in depression moved on to Mauritius, Ceylon, and India. In India he was commanded to appear before the nizam of Hyderabad and gave a gala performance for the viceroy on 12 January 1886. On his return home he moved from Dublin to London, where his second season opened on 30 July 1886, at the Prince's Theatre (later the Prince of Wales Theatre) in Coventry Street, Piccadilly. The show closed at the end of January 1887 because Du Val was suffering from laryngitis.<br>
<br>The Du Vals made a third, successful, tour of South Africa in 1888 and went on to Mauritius and Ceylon. Du Val was exhausted and ill on reaching Ceylon and the tour was abandoned. They sailed for home on 13 February 1889. Du Val seemed better, but on the evening of 22 February 1889, during the passage through the Red Sea, he became agitated and ran up on deck, saying he wanted a walk. He was never seen again. His death made headlines in London and South Africa; reports suggesting suicide were denied, but stigma attached itself to his memory. He left a personal estate amounting to over &pound;3000 and was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
