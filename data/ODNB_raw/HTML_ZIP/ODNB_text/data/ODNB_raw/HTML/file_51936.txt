<span class="headword">Clifton,  Robert Bellamy</span>  (1836&#150;1921), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born at Gedney in Lincolnshire on 13 March 1836, the only son of Robert Clifton, a landowner, and his wife, Frances Gibbons. After schooling in Peterborough and Brighton he studied at University College, London, and in 1855 entered St John's College, Cambridge. His position as sixth wrangler in the tripos in 1859 was seen as disappointing, but he was second Smith's prizeman and became a fellow of his college. In 1860 he was appointed the first professor of natural philosophy at Owens College, Manchester. There he lectured successfully and in 1862 married Catharine Elizabeth Butler (<i>d</i>. 1917) of Brighton. They had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Clifton's application for the new chair of experimental philosophy at Oxford in 1865 was supported by testimonials from Henry Roscoe, William Thomson, James Prescott Joule, William Whewell, George Gabriel Stokes, and J. C. Adams, as well as from Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff of Heidelberg, who had met Clifton during a visit to Manchester in 1862. This support and his record at Cambridge and Manchester set him comfortably ahead of the only other applicant, George Griffith, an Oxford graduate and part-time schoolmaster at Winchester College, who had deputized as professor of experimental philosophy during the protracted incapacity of the Revd Professor Robert Walker. After arriving in Oxford in 1866 Clifton began his tenure of the chair promisingly. More than a decade after its foundation, the school of natural science had achieved respectability, and the opening of the university museum in 1860 had further advanced the interests of science in the university. The flow of students seeking laboratory instruction immediately rendered the space for experimental philosophy in the museum inadequate, and Clifton began a campaign for the new laboratory that was to constitute his greatest single contribution to the discipline and to Oxford.<br>
<br>Although Clifton's case rested on a belief in the importance of training in experimental technique that most progressive physicists would have shared, it appeared initially to have little chance of success. But it carried the day when the trustees of the funds arising from the bequest of the great-grandson of the earl of Clarendon offered &pound;10,700 for the erection of what was to be the first purpose-built physics laboratory in the world. The Clarendon Laboratory, as it soon came to be called, was completed in 1872 at a total cost of &pound;12,000.<br>
<br>The internal design and fitting out of the Clarendon reflected Clifton's concern for detail and his vision of the laboratory as a leading centre for teaching and research in the physics of precise measurement. Conscious of the delicacy of much of the equipment, he devoted each room to a specific range of experiments, so that the students, rather than the equipment, moved about the building. Fear of the harm that could befall apparatus in inexperienced hands also made him cautious about releasing it from the locked cupboards in which it was kept when not in immediate use. These attitudes discouraged all but the most committed students, and few chose to specialize in physics for the honour school. In 1887 Clifton's failure to develop the subject at the honours level had its inevitable consequences when convocation rejected his request for &pound;4800 for the construction of an electrical laboratory. This defeat, allied to the persistent neglect of his case for the appointment of other professors (in particular, of someone who would teach electricity, in which he had little competence), appears to have undermined Clifton's will to fight for his subject, and in 1895 he reallocated his personal laboratory for the purposes of teaching. In fact, the decision to relinquish his laboratory had few consequences, for Clifton had published only one substantial scientific article since arriving in Oxford.<br>
<br>The last two decades of Clifton's career, until he retired in 1915, were marked by the undiminished fastidiousness of his teaching but also by tensions. The long-awaited appointment of a second professor, J. S. E. Townsend, in 1900 brought him more unhappiness than relief. He and Townsend never worked well together, and Townsend consistently attracted the larger share of serious students and of material support, notably for a new and quite separate electrical laboratory, opened in 1910.<br>
<br>For much of his career Clifton was active in the wider world of science. As a fellow of the Royal Society, to which he was elected in 1868, he served three times on the council and was vice-president from 1896 to 1898. He was also president of the Physical Society from 1882 to 1884 and maintained friendships in the discipline, notably with Stokes. But he was a reserved and at times difficult colleague. Although a fellow of Merton College (from 1869) and an honorary fellow of Wadham, he took little active part in college life and never secured the allies that his discipline needed within the university. He was best known, in fact, for quiet domestic hospitality, offered at his home in Oxford until his wife's death in 1917.<br>
<br>Clifton's involvement in public life beyond science tended to be concentrated in his earlier years in Oxford. In the late 1860s and 1870s he was an informative witness before the Devonshire commission on scientific instruction and other inquiries, and from 1879 to 1886 served on the royal commission on accidents in mines, for which he performed experiments and even designed a new safety lamp. A more enduring and, in the years of agricultural depression, burdensome commitment was his supervision of the property in Gedney that he inherited on his father's death in 1873. It was typical of Clifton that his activities were so dispersed and that he invested so much energy in each of them. Despite his thin record in research his life was full and, not least because of his curious habit of working from midnight until the early morning before sleeping for a couple of hours and appearing in the laboratory at 11 a.m., quietly productive. He died at his home, 3 Bardwell Road, Oxford, on 22 February 1921. The obituaries that followed convey the impression of someone whose personal dignity and achievements as a teacher were valued more highly than the subsequent, generally critical assessments of him would suggest.<br>
