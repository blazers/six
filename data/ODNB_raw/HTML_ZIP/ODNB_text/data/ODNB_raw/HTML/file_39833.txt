</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Isherwood,  Christopher William Bradshaw</span>  (1904&#150;1986), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 26 August 1904 at Wyberslegh Hall, High Lane, Cheshire, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Edward Bradshaw-Isherwood (1869&#150;1915), professional soldier in the York and Lancaster regiment, of Marple, Cheshire, and his wife, Kathleen (1868&#150;1960), the only child of Frederick Machell Smith, wine merchant, of Bury St Edmunds. His family followed the regiment to assorted garrison towns in England and Ireland, and this peripatetic childhood inaugurated a lifetime of travelling. Isherwood's sense of rootlessness was increased when his father was killed at the battle of Ypres in May 1915: his mother had no settled home until 1921, when she rented a house in Kensington, London.<br>
<br>Isherwood was educated at Repton School, where he met Edward Upward, who was to be a lifelong friend and, as he later put it, &#145;the judge before whom all my work must stand trial&#146;  (C. Isherwood, &#145;Introduction&#146; to <span class="italic">All the Conspirators</span>, 1976, 9). He followed Upward to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, ostensibly to read history. He spent most of his time, however, inventing a surrealist-Gothic world with Upward, which gradually crystallized around the imaginary village of Mortmere. The few surviving episodes of this constantly evolving saga were eventually published as <span class="italic">The Mortmere Stories</span> (1994).<br>
<br>The First World War, in which the certainties of the Edwardian world were destroyed, affected both Isherwood and his mother deeply, but in very different ways. Kathleen's romantic attachment to the past, a <i>paradis perdu</i> of ordered conservatism embodied by the Isherwood family seat, Marple Hall, increased in intensity. Isherwood reacted strongly against this, and much of his life may be seen as a search for some creed to replace the traditional, public-school, Christian values of his childhood. Determined to become a writer, he left university prematurely, having deliberately failed his tripos by submitting facetious answers to the examination questions. He began earning his living as secretary to the International String Quartet, and found the distinctly bohemian home of its leader, Andr&eacute; Mangeot, far preferable to what he saw as the stultifyingly bourgeois ambience of his mother's residence.<br>
<br>In 1925 Isherwood was reintroduced to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30775/', "W. H. Auden (1907&#150;1973)")</script>, whom he had known at preparatory school, and through him met Stephen Spender: the three men were to form a conspicuous literary, left-wing triumvirate of the 1930s. Auden sought Isherwood's approval for almost all his early work, and dedicated his first two volumes of poetry to him. The two men had a casual affair lasting over a decade, and Auden subsequently listed Isherwood among the &#145;great emotional milestones of his life&#146;  (E. Mendelson, <span class="italic">Later Auden</span>, 1999, 266). Auden's place in Isherwood's emotional life was less significant, but the two men remained close friends and occasional literary collaborators. Most of Isherwood's juvenilia reflected his obsession with public schools and the opportunities they provided for homosexual romance. His first published novel, <span class="italic">All the Conspirators</span> (1928), was an oblique story of family discord, influenced by the work of E. M. Forster and Virginia Woolf. The conflict between mother and son was to be as frequent a motif in his work as it was in his life, and resurfaced in <span class="italic">The Memorial</span> (1932), a remarkably acute and assured novel about the pre- and post-war generations, seen from both sides of the divide.<br>
<br>After a brief and unenthusiastic period studying medicine at King's College, London (October 1928&#150;March 1929), Isherwood followed Auden to Berlin, partly in order to pursue a homosexual life in the unfettered atmosphere of the Weimar republic. He witnessed the rise of Nazism, and wrote two classic novels of the era, <span class="italic">Mr Norris Changes Trains</span> (1935) and <span class="italic">Goodbye to Berlin</span> (1939). Both were sardonic tragi-comedies, and the latter contains the famous sentence &#145;I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording not thinking&#146;, which (to Isherwood's increasing irritation) was often quoted as a summation of his fictional method. To this period also belonged the collaborations with Auden: three plays written for the experimental Group Theatre&#151;<span class="italic">The Dog Beneath the Skin</span> (1935), <span class="italic">The Ascent of F6</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">On the Frontier</span> (1938)&#151;and <span class="italic">Journey to a War</span> (1939), an account of their travels in China during the Sino-Japanese War. <span class="italic">Lions and Shadows</span> (1938), subtitled &#145;An Education in the Twenties&#146;, was a sly, self-deprecating, and very funny autobiography in which Isherwood reviewed his youth from the lofty eminence of thirty-four.<br>
<br>Isherwood spent much of the 1930s travelling in Europe with his young German lover, Heinz Neddermeyer, looking for somewhere they could settle without being harried by immigration officials and the German military authorities. The task of getting Neddermeyer a new passport was unwisely assigned to Gerald Hamilton, a colourful conman who had provided Isherwood with a model for the eponymous Mr Norris. Despite receiving large amounts of money, Hamilton failed to produce any papers and Neddermeyer was finally arrested in 1937. He was tried and imprisoned for draft evasion and sexual offences, after which Isherwood returned alone to London.<br>
<br>In January 1939 Isherwood and Auden emigrated to the United States of America, a controversial decision seen in some quarters as little short of &#145;desertion&#146;. Uncertain of his future, Isherwood travelled to California to consult the exiled Irish mystic and pacifist Gerald Heard, who was to be one of several guru figures in his life. He settled in Los Angeles (he became an American citizen in 1946), but wracked by feelings of guilt, &#145;war-neurosis&#146;, and literary impotence, needed something to give order and a spiritual dimension to his life. He found this in Vedantism and became a disciple of Swami Prabhavananda, who had set up a temple in Hollywood. Through the Austrian director Berthold Viertel, with whom he had collaborated in England on the film <span class="italic">Little Friend</span> (1934), Isherwood found work as a screenwriter for MGM. His Hollywood career, though remunerative, was undistinguished, and included scripts for <span class="italic">The Great Sinner</span> (1949), loosely based on Dostoyevsky, and <span class="italic">Diane</span> (1956), a lavish and catastrophically miscast costume drama.<br>
<br>In 1941 Isherwood went to work in a Quaker-run hostel in Pennsylvania, where he helped refugees fleeing Europe acclimatize themselves to America and find work. When America entered the war, he registered as a conscientious objector and entered a Vedanta monastery, where he collaborated with Prabhavananda on a new translation of the <span class="italic">Bhagavad-gita</span> (1944), became co-editor of the movement's magazine, <span class="italic">Vedanta and the West</span>, and wrote <span class="italic">Prater Violet</span> (1945), a cinematic novella about his experiences with Viertel at Gaumont-British. Recognizing that he was unsuited to the monastic life (he found sexual abstinence particularly challenging), he left the monastery in 1945 and set up house with Bill Caskey, an ebullient, argumentative, and hard-drinking Irish-American. Their relationship was extremely volatile, which made it difficult for Isherwood to concentrate on his writing, but it resulted in <span class="italic">The Condor and the Cows</span> (1949), a book about their travels in South America, for which Caskey, a gifted photographer, provided the illustrations.<br>
<br>In April 1953 Isherwood met Don Jess Bachardy (<i>b</i>. 1934), a student almost thirty years his junior, who later became a renowned portraitist: they lived together until Isherwood's death. His attempt to write an &#145;American&#146; novel, <span class="italic">The World in the Evening</span> (1954), took Isherwood a great deal of time and effort and pleased the author as little as it did the critics. <span class="italic">Down there on a Visit</span> (1962), which consisted of four lightly fictionalized interlinking episodes from Isherwood's past, was far more successful. Isherwood continued to work on film and television projects, sometimes in collaboration with Bachardy, but in 1960 also began teaching English literature at the University of California. An Isherwood-like professor was the protagonist of <span class="italic">A Single Man</span> (1964), a profound, witty, and touching book about being an outsider in American society. Its unapologetic, indeed combative, portrait of a homosexual man refusing the customary role of victim displeased many conservative critics, but the novel came to be widely regarded as Isherwood's masterpiece. During the 1960s he wrote further books on Vedanta, including a biography of Ramakrishna (1965), and a novel on related themes, <span class="italic">A Meeting by the River</span> (1967), which he subsequently adapted for the stage.<br>
<br>In 1966 Isherwood published <span class="italic">Exhumations</span> (1966), a collection of stories, articles, and verses intended as &#145;fragments of an autobiography which tells itself indirectly, by means of exhibits&#146;  (prefatory note). Other fragments of autobiography included <span class="italic">Kathleen and Frank</span> (1971), a detailed portrait of his parents which he felt &#145;on closer examination&#146; could be seen to be &#145;chiefly about&#146; its author  (<span class="italic">Kathleen and Frank</span>, 363), <span class="italic">Christopher and his Kind</span> (1976), which described his life&#151;in particular his homosexual life&#151;during the 1930s, and <span class="italic">My Guru and his Disciple</span> (1980), a somewhat proselytizing account of his relationship with Prabhavananda. He was an assiduous diarist, and although he destroyed or lost most of the journals covering his pre-war life, those he kept from 1939 onwards survive and run to over 1 million words. They were published posthumously in three volumes.<br>
<br>Isherwood's principal characteristic, both in his life and his work, was an apparent candour; he was also a professional charmer, and these two qualities offset his considerable vanity. He was of short stature, with a disproportionately large head, a prominent nose, and deep-set, penetrating eyes overhung by bristling eyebrows. Although he maintained a strikingly boyish appearance well into old age, he was a lifelong hypochondriac. He died of prostate cancer on 4 January 1986 at his home, 145 Adelaide Drive, Santa Monica, California. He had no funeral or grave and his body was left to science. He was survived by Don Bachardy.<br>
