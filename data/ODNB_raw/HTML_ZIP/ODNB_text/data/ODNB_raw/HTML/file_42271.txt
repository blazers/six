<span class="headword">Winchcombe,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1439?), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, is first recorded in payments to him by New College, Oxford for &#145;forming stones&#146; at Swalcliffe, Oxfordshire, in 1404/5 and 1405/6. These references probably concern the extant tithe barn built there in 1403&#150;6. His most important work for New College was the chancel of Adderbury church, Oxfordshire, built 1408&#150;18. An absence from Adderbury in 1410/11 points to employment elsewhere. He may be identical with the Richard Winchcombe whom Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1439), employed in 1408/9 as master mason of the undercroft of a new and expensively finished tenement at the corner of the High Street and Castle Street in Warwick.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1430 the University of Oxford formally appointed Winchcombe master mason of its Divinity School and made a house in the city available to him and his dependants. Work on the Divinity School had started in the early 1420s, but it seems certain that Winchcombe had been in charge from the outset, as the design shows the closest affinity with his documented work at Adderbury. The most prominent traits common to both buildings are the exaggeratedly flattened four-centred arches and the attenuated proportions of all members, especially bases. Presumably Winchcombe was dead by 1439, for in January 1440 the university contracted with Thomas Elkin for the completion of the Divinity School, on which Elkin was already at work. Elkin was ordered to eschew the over-elaboration of the parts already completed, whose complexities were said to have been criticized as inappropriate by many magnates and other knowledgeable persons. This critique has often been interpreted as evidence of a general shift in mid-fifteenth-century architectural taste, a further instance of which is said to be Henry VI's instruction of 1448 that the chapel of King's College, Cambridge, be kept plain. However, both references are not so much statements of aesthetic preference as assertions of the importance of matching architectural means to function. That the exceptionally elaborate character of the earliest work on the Divinity School was discovered by the university authorities to have breached their notion of decorum only after its execution was well under way, suggests they had failed to follow the normal procedure of agreeing a design with the architect before work began. No doubt the deteriorating economic climate in the mid-fifteenth century made it expedient to simplify the original ambitious scheme. Among the still-visible effects of this retrenchment are the abrupt and unconcealed change to a simpler form of window reveal. Although it was executed late in the fifteenth century, the existing pendant lierne vault of the Divinity School appears to conform in its general disposition to that intended at the outset.<br>
<br>Winchcombe's authorship of the most ambitious non-ecclesiastical structure built in fifteenth-century England is likely to have brought his work to the notice of other patrons. Attributable to him on stylistic grounds are the Milcombe Chapel at Bloxham and the delicately fan-vaulted Wilcote Chapel at North Leigh, both in Oxfordshire. Winchcombe's work, arguably the most individual of its period, is prime evidence that in the early fifteenth century the city and county of Oxford supported a tradition of perpendicular architecture equalling in creative vitality that of any English region.<br>
