<span class="headword">Aid&eacute;,  (Charles) Hamilton</span>  (1826&#150;1906), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, born in the rue St Honor&eacute;, Paris, on 4 November 1826, was the younger son of George A&iuml;d&aacute; (<i>d</i>. 1830), a diplomatist and the son of an Armenian merchant settled in Constantinople, and his wife, Georgina Collier (<i>d</i>. 1875), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5915/', "Admiral Sir George Collier")</script>. Aid&eacute;'s youth was marked by the deaths of his cosmopolitan father in a duel in Paris, when Aid&eacute; was only four years old, and of his brother Frederick (1823&#150;31), killed in an accident in Boulogne the following year.<br>
<br>Taken by his mother to England, Aid&eacute; was educated privately at East Sheen and Greenwich until the age of sixteen, when he was sent to the University of Bonn. In 1846 he obtained a commission in the British army, serving with the 85th light infantry until 1853, when he retired with the rank of captain. After a period of foreign travel he settled in England, living chiefly at Lyndhurst in the New Forest with his mother until her death at Southsea, Hampshire, on 12 October 1875. He then took rooms in Queen Anne's Gate, London, where he entertained prominent figures in the British and French social and artistic worlds.<br>
<br>Aid&eacute;, who spoke and wrote French as easily as English, devoted himself to society, music, art, and literature. In 1856 he published his first volume of poems, <span class="italic">Eleanore, and other Poems</span>. His first novel, <span class="italic">Rita</span>, also appeared in 1856 and enjoyed greater popularity than his poetry, running to four editions within nine years and being translated into French in 1862. Aid&eacute; capitalized on his success, producing <span class="italic">Confidences: by the Author of &#145;Rita&#146;</span> in 1859, which also sold well. His novels were light romances set in fashionable society and were simply written, under an obvious French influence. His frequent use of first-person female narrators led some early reviewers to believe that he was a woman. In 1868 he serialized a novel, <span class="italic">The Marstons</span>, in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and he was to write a further fifteen novels over the next forty years, including <span class="italic">Penruddock</span> (1873), an autobiographical novel containing revealing sections on the protagonist's &#145;vexed relation with his mother&#146;  (Sutherland, 13) and his experiences in the army. Also of interest is <span class="italic">A Voyage of Discovery</span> (1892), which contains a depiction of American society that angered many transatlantic readers.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Biograph and Review</span> observed that &#145;Certainly the combination of poet, novelist, dramatist and musical composer is an unusual one, and exhibits Mr Aid&eacute; as a man of exceptional powers and accomplishments&#146;. In the 1870s Aid&eacute; had turned his attention to the stage, and <span class="italic">Philip</span>, a romantic drama in four acts, was produced by Henry Irving at the Lyceum in London in February 1874, Irving taking the title role. A year later, <span class="italic">A Nine Days' Wonder</span>, adapted from Aid&eacute;'s simultaneously published novel for copyright reasons, was staged at the Court Theatre by John Hare. It was compared to French drama and praised for its &#145;neatness of construction rare in English art&#146;  (Knight, 46).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Aid&eacute; continued to write novels and poetry. <span class="italic">Poet and Peer</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">Introduced to Society</span> (1884) confirmed his reputation as a writer of light popular fiction. In 1882 he produced a collection of poetry, <span class="italic">Songs without Music: Rhymes and Recitations</span>, which was enlarged in 1889. Many poems appeared in popular Victorian anthologies, and he set many to music. &#145;The Danube River&#146;, &#145;The Spanish Boat Song&#146;, and &#145;Brown Eyes and Blue Eyes&#146; were among his best-known songs. A collection of seven one-act plays entitled <span class="italic">We are Seven: Half Hours on the Stage, Grave and Gay</span> appeared in 1902, and his final collection of poems, <span class="italic">Past and Present</span>, in 1903.<br>
<br>Aid&eacute; died, unmarried, at 28 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, London, on 13 December 1906 and was buried in the churchyard of All Souls, South Ascot, Berkshire. A novel, <span class="italic">The Chivalry of Harold</span>, was published posthumously in 1907.<br>
