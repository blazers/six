<span class="headword">Ramkins,  Alexander</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>b. </em>1671/2, <em>d.</em> in or after 1719), <span class="occ">supposed Jacobite author</span>, was once thought to have written <span class="italic">The Memoirs of Majr. Alexander Ramkins, a Highland-Officer, now in Prison at Avignon</span> (1719; reissued, 1720), an anti-Jacobite polemic attributed to Daniel Defoe, from which the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> article was solely derived. In the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> Ramkins, a world-weary soldier, remembers when he, then an ardent young Scots-Catholic Jacobite, followed James II into exile in France; how he painfully became convinced that his host country was merely playing politics with the Stuarts; and how, despairing of the Stuarts ever regaining the monarchy, he has become so disillusioned with the Jacobite movement that, reconciled to the protestant succession, he is ready to return to his native land and accept Hanoverian rule.<br>
<br>Ramkins describes his participation in most of the contemporary Jacobite campaigns following the highlanders' victory at the battle of Killiecrankie, in July 1689, that inspired his abrupt departure from Aberdeen University and pointed him toward a military career in the Jacobite forces. He observed the French [<i>sic</i>] siege of Mainz, in September 1689, and after military college in Strasbourg and a brief Rhineland tour of duty with the grand musqueteers, fought in Ireland at the battle of the Boyne and in the first siege of Limerick in July and August 1690. Having been wounded at the battle of Aughrim he returned to France with the Irish troops under the articles of Limerick, late in 1691.<br>
<br>Ramkins chose not to join the projected Jacobite descent in the spring of 1692, but fought in the Piedmont campaign that summer. He participated in the battle of Landen, where he was severely wounded, in September 1693. He spent the winter of 1695&#150;6 in St Germain, where he heard rumours of another proposed descent, and he agonized over his decision not to join it. He speaks critically of the treaty of Ryswick (September 1697), but warmly of the prolonged visit to England it sanctioned. When Ramkins returned, he married. But having made what seemed an extraordinarily prudent choice, ironically he was ruined by her extravagance, and thus writes his putative memoirs from prison.<br>
<br>Apart from these <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, no solid evidence exists attesting to Ramkins having actually lived. Except for those biographical dictionaries for which the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> is the source (his article was by Norman Moore), his name does not appear in any of the contemporary or later lists of eighteenth-century Scots, Roman Catholics, Jacobites, distinguished citizens, or even general obituaries. No Alexander Ramkins (or Rankine, unlike Ramkins an authentic Scottish, though lowland, name) appears among the admittedly scant list of 1688&#150;9 students of King's or Marischal colleges, Aberdeen; nor is it likely that Roman Catholic Ramkins could have been enrolled there at that time because Principal John Row's regulations prohibiting the matriculation of Roman Catholics were still strictly enforced.<br>
<br>More significantly, neither Ramkins nor his brother can be traced through their military records, though Ramkins was purportedly on active or inactive duty with an Irish regiment of the French army for almost twenty-eight years, and his brother &#145;belong[ed] to the Guards of King James II. &hellip; and was kill'd in <i>Ireland</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 10). Neither is listed in the Public Record Office, in Charles Dalton's <span class="italic">English Army Lists and Commission Registers, 1661&#150;1714</span>, in the regimental Stuart papers at Windsor Castle, in the comprehensive regimental catalogue &#145;Jacobite army in Ireland, 1689&#146;, or in the National Military History Society of Largs (Ayrshire); nor is Ramkins's brother listed among the 1688 muster rolls for James's Scottish foot or life guards.<br>
<br>Ramkins's fictionality is confirmed by a number of mistakes in the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> chronology that an actual participant simply could not have made; among them, the treaty of Ryswick is described as preceding the battle of Landen, the emperor's besiegers are confused with the French besieged at Mainz in 1689, and, especially, there is the chronological impossibility, given the details of the text, of Ramkins arriving in time to witness the Mainz siege.<br>
