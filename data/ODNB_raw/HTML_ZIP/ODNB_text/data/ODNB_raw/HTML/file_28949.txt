<span class="headword">Weckherlin,  Georg Rudolph</span>  (1584&#150;1653), <span class="occ">government official and poet</span>, was born in Stuttgart on 15 September 1584, the fifth of eleven children, and one of ten sons of Johannes Weckherlin the younger (<i>d</i>. 1610), a bureaucrat in the service of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, and his wife, Ursula Sadeler. The family were deeply pious Lutherans. Weckherlin was counted as a gentleman in a Westminster census of 1635 and in April 1639 was granted English arms on the basis of his family's armigerous status in Stuttgart. Educated at the P&auml;dagogium zu Stuttgart, in 1599 he matriculated in the faculty of law at the University of T&uuml;bingen. He studied languages at both school and university, where his studies were inclined more toward politics than the finer points of the law.<br>
<br>By 1606 Weckherlin was employed in a W&uuml;rttemberg embassy to France, and between 1607 and 1615 spent about three years in diplomatic missions to England. During these trips he met Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1645), daughter of Francis Raworth, town clerk of Dover. They were married in England on 13 September 1616 and then travelled to W&uuml;rttemberg, where Elizabeth soon gave birth to their two children, Ralph and Elizabeth. Weckherlin and both children were naturalized English citizens in 1630 by letters patent.<br>
<br>In 1616 Weckherlin was appointed secretary interpreter and court historiographer to the duke of W&uuml;rttemberg. In the same year he participated in arranging the festivities associated with the baptism of the duke's eldest son, and published a description of the events, in German, blending verse with prose. He followed this with an English version, <span class="italic">Triumphall Shews Set Forth Lately in Stutgart</span> (1616). A similar work followed in 1618 associated with the ducal baptism and wedding. Then in 1618&#150;19 he published two volumes of &#145;Oden und Ges&auml;nge&#146; (&#145;Odes and Songs&#146;) embracing a considerable range of verse forms. In 1619 he was back in England apparently on a mission from the princes of the union, and the following year joined the Bohemian court-in-exile at Heidelberg. He seems to have worked in England on behalf of the Palatines in the early 1620s, although by his own account he was employed by Sir Edward Conway, secretary of state, from November 1625. On Conway's personal staff as opposed to holding an official crown appointment, he continued in the employ of each of Conway's successors until 1640. He was appointed secretary interpreter for the German tongue in 1631 and deputy secretary interpreter for the French tongue not long afterwards. His duties involved acting as a cryptographer as well as dealing with diplomatic correspondence and translation work. The secretary of state, Sir John Coke, old and infirm toward the end of his tenure, allowed Weckherlin to perform a large part of his duties, including application of the signet and privy seals, to the envy of fellow bureaucrats, who complained of Weckherlin's &#145;dexterity&#146; at cutting them out, with the loss of their fees. Many of these duties brought Weckherlin into close, informal contact with Charles I, and he became attached to the king's entourage, travelling with him at almost all times and assisting the king with personal tasks, such as writing poetry.<br>
<br>In 1627 Weckherlin was given oversight of the pre-publication licensing of news for the press, soon expanded to include history and &#145;matters of state&#146;. The only item he is known to have prohibited was Sir Robert Filmer's <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, presented for a licence in 1632. Weckherlin had personal ties to the publishing business through his brother-in-law, Robert Raworth, a London printer, and his patent to print Latin school books, obtained in 1631 to reward him in part for his service, for which he had been badly paid. His role as licenser, and his support of his brother-in-law in the face of official censure, brought him into conflict with Archbishop Laud, who vigorously exercised the church's authority in oversight of the press and apparently tried to have Weckherlin removed from his post in the 1630s. Weckherlin, who had a long memory of all slights dealt to him, later testified at Laud's trial as a witness for the prosecution.<br>
<br>Though Weckherlin had performed the duties of secretary for the Latin tongue since 1625 he was never formally appointed to the position, nor paid its wages. When Sir Henry Vane became secretary in 1640, Weckherlin hoped he would receive &#145;some small fruit of the great toil &amp; labours I have undergone in all foreign affairs, which afford no benefit nor comfort at all&#146;, but the king asked only that Weckherlin continue in the same capacity in Vane's service  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/444/53). Weckherlin continued to write government letters after Vane's dismissal late in 1641. Despite his personal relationship with the king, which apparently endured to some degree, and with Sir Edward Nicholas, Weckherlin did not join the royalist cause. His creation as MA of Cambridge University in 1642 may have been intended to serve as reward or as an enticement. He later wrote that he had served the Long Parliament since 1642, and in February 1644 was employed by its committee of both kingdoms. Designated secretary for foreign affairs he performed the same sorts of duties he had in service to successive secretaries of state. He continued to work with codes and ciphers and helped decipher and prepare for publication Charles I's sensitive private correspondence and papers of the king's secretary of state, George, Lord Digby, captured at the battle of Naseby. In 1647 he was appointed secretary for foreign languages to the committee.<br>
<br>In these years Weckherlin rejoiced in his eleven grandchildren, the children of his daughter Elizabeth and her husband, William Trumbull, of Easthampstead Park, Berkshire, where Weckherlin taught French and Latin to one of his grandsons, William, a future secretary of state. But his beloved wife died in 1645, while his son, Ralph, went to fight in the king's army and subsequently into exile with the royal court, not to return to England until after the Restoration. Weckherlin continued to complain of small reward for a large amount of work and made repeated attempts to collect wages and arrears over the course of the 1640s. All of these blows, added to his own ill health due to gout and circulatory problems, the execution of the king, and the reorganization of the government, caused him to leave his post by March 1649 when he was replaced by another poet and Latin scholar, John Milton. But by March 1652 Milton had substantially lost his sight and the council of state recalled Weckherlin to assist with foreign affairs. This reappointment was short-lived, however, as Weckherlin died in office, some time between 27 January and 21 February 1653.<br>
<br>Weckherlin worked long and hard in the service of his adopted country, sacrificing his health and his greatest source of happiness&#151;spending time with his family&#151;in the process. At the same time he attained the standing of a considerable poet, well recognized by his contemporaries, especially the German-speaking &eacute;migr&eacute; community in London, as well as by modern scholars. He is credited with pioneering the vernacular form of German verse in the seventeenth century and has been considered one of the most notable German poets of the period, prior to Martin Opitz. He wrote sonnets in Italian and English, but despite living for many years in England continued to write most of his poetry in German and published his works in German-speaking areas, for example the volume of poems shepherded through the Elsevier press in Leiden by his friend Theodore Haak in 1641. Expanded in 1648, it contained a notable lament for Gustavus Adolphus, a rallying call to protestant Germany, and spiritual poems. He also wrote masques, at least one in English. Weckherlin's papers passed to his daughter's family and are to be found in the Trumbull papers in the British Library.<br>
