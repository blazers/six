<span class="headword">Walker,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Wonderful Walker]</span>  (1710&#150;1802), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 21 February 1710 at Undercrag in Seathwaite near Broughton in Furness in the Duddon valley, Lancashire, the last of twelve children of Nicholas Walker (<i>d</i>. 1728), yeoman, and his wife, Elizabeth. As they thought him too delicate to earn his living by fell farming or slate quarrying, his parents resolved to &#145;breed him a scholar&#146;. To complete his education and qualify for ordination, Walker left Seathwaite for Eskdale and then the Vale of Lorton, enduring for the best part of a decade the itinerant and impoverished life of schoolmaster, deacon, and curate, and acquiring in the process habits of application and frugality that he never subsequently forsook. During this period his efforts were supported by James Stephenson, curate of Seathwaite, Thomas Parker, curate of Eskdale, and Christopher Denton, rector of Gosforth. Finally in 1736 he was nominated to the curacy of his native Seathwaite. On 5 January 1736 he married Ann Tyson (1707/8&#150;1800), a domestic servant from Brackenthwaite whom he had met in Buttermere, and they set up house in the cottage adjoining the chapel where he was to officiate for over sixty-six years. Ann had a portion of &pound;40, Robert a stipend of &pound;5 per annum to begin with. They were to have ten children, eight of whom survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Yet in spite of his straitened circumstances Walker became a prosperous man by local standards, and left about &pound;1500 at his death. Remarkably, he had become wealthy without seriously jeopardizing the dignity of his office or forfeiting the affections of his parishioners. His successor wrote in the parish register that he was a man &#145;Singular for his Temperance, Industry and Integrity&#146;. In <span class="italic">The Excursion</span> Wordsworth reported that the local shepherds called him &#145;Wonderful&#146;, and the poet later celebrated him in Sonnet 17 of <span class="italic">The River Duddon</span> as<blockquote>
<div>A Pastor such as Chaucer's verse portrays;<br>
</div>
<div>Such as the heaven-taught skill of Herbert drew.<br>
</div> (Wordsworth)</blockquote>On weekdays Walker taught the local children in the chapel, plying his spinning wheel as he listened to them recite their lessons. He then carried the wool in 16 or 32 lb bales over the high cross 7 miles to Broughton market. He farmed his small glebe and hired himself out to local farmers. When he called on him in 1755, the Broughton curate found Walker at &#145;one of the most servile of the country's employments, which out of regard to persons of our profession, I shall forbear to mention&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 30, 1760, 318). He was equally industrious with the pen, writing deeds and wills and keeping accounts. About 1754 he became steward of the manor of Dunnerdale with Seathwaite, and subsequently served his patron in that capacity for forty years, presiding over the annual court baron and recording its proceedings in his beautiful hand. The position not only brought him the customary fees but enabled him to purchase parcels of land around the manor, and he eventually became owner of a nearby farm at Longhouse. Later he invested in industry both locally and further afield as his eldest son (1736&#150;1808) and then grandson (1768&#150;1822), both named Zaccheus, rose to partnership status in Boulton and Watt. Walker died at the Chapelhouse, Seathwaite, on 25 June 1802, and was buried in the churchyard there three days later.<br>
<br>Robert Walker had supplemented his stipend by selling ale. Though not uncommon among poverty-ridden curates, the practice was frowned upon and the fact was suppressed by some early eulogists. It explains why his successor put &#145;Temperance&#146; at the head of his virtues. Indeed, all reports agree on the austere simplicity of the Walkers' way of life; their diet was devoid of luxuries such as tea and coffee. But their hospitality to parishioners and passing travellers was famed. Their eldest daughter, Elizabeth (1738&#150;1820), carried on the tradition as proprietor of the Black Bull in Coniston and her daughter, as Mrs Casson, kept the Newfield inn in Seathwaite just 200 yards down the valley from her grandfather's church. To that inn in 1804 came William and Dorothy Wordsworth, enquiring about the late curate. The result of those enquiries appeared in the passage in <span class="italic">The Excursion</span> (Book 7, lines 351ff.), published in 1814. Then in October 1819 a descendant, Robert Walker Bamford (1796&#150;1838), published a prose tribute to his great-grandfather in the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span>, probably too late to influence the treatment of Walker by Wordsworth in the eighteenth sonnet of <span class="italic">The River Duddon</span>, published in the spring of the following year, but in time to be quoted in the prose memoir of him that Wordsworth included in the notes to that volume.<br>
<br>Walker's posthumous reputation owes much to Wordsworth's praise. Indubitably, Wordsworth, Bamford, and later Canon Richard Parkinson (1797&#150;1858)&#151;in his novel <span class="italic">The Old Church Clock</span> (1843)&#151;idealized the mountain curate. For example, Wordsworth not only suppressed the matter of ale-selling but also misrepresented Walker's failed attempt to add the neighbouring curacy of Ulpha to that of Seathwaite as a modest refusal of an unsolicited offer made by the bishop. However, Walker's local reputation and the testimony inscribed in the register preceded their public tributes; and not only his descendants, but his parishioners and their descendants assisted in the preservation of the memory of &#145;a varra good man&#146;. Visitors to the Seathwaite chapel graveyard afford ample evidence that his modest fame has outlasted the mere century predicted for it in <span class="italic">The Excursion</span>:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">A simple stone<br>
</div>
<div>May cover him; and by its help, perchance,<br>
</div>
<div>A century shall hear his name pronounced,<br>
</div>
<div>With images attendant on the sound;<br>
</div>
<div>Then shall the slowly gathering twilight close<br>
</div>
<div>In utter night; and of his course remain<br>
</div>
<div>No cognizable vestiges, no more<br>
</div>
<div>Than of this breath, which shapes itself in words<br>
</div>
<div>To speak of him, and instantly dissolves.<br>
</div> (W. Wordsworth, <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, ed. E. de Selincourt and H. Darbishire, 1946, 5.242)</blockquote>
