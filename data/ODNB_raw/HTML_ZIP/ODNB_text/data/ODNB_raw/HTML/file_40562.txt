<span class="headword">Shiel,  Matthew Phipps</span>  (1865&#150;1947), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 20 July 1865 in Plymouth, Montserrat, West Indies, the ninth child and only son of Matthew Dowdy Shiell (1825&#150;1888), a shipowner and Methodist lay preacher of Irish descent, and Priscilla Ann Blake (1830&#150;1910), who was of mixed race. A precocious juvenile, he wrote newspaper columns and an unpublished novel. At fifteen he was ceremoniously crowned by his father as king of Redonda, a rocky islet near Monserrat, and he allowed his fictitious title to be perpetuated. He was educated at Harrison College, a boarding-school in Barbados. In London after 1883, he matriculated at London University, briefly studied medicine, and became a schoolmaster. By the early nineties he was contributing stories to penny weeklies and associating with such writers as W. T. Stead and Arthur Machen.<br>
<br>In 1895 Shiel (as he thereafter spelled his name), published <span class="italic">Prince Zaleski</span>, describing mysteries solved by an eccentric Russian. <span class="italic">The Rajah's Sapphire</span> and <span class="italic">Shapes in the Fire</span> appeared the next year. On 3 November 1898 he married Carolina Garcia Gomez (1879/80&#150;1903), daughter of Miguel Garcia Gomez, a Seville merchant. They had one child, a daughter. That year <span class="italic">The Yellow Danger</span> introduced the menace of Chinese domination of the world. <span class="italic">Contraband of War</span> (1899), an adventure of rival naval innovators, was followed by two historical romances, <span class="italic">Cold Steel</span> (1899) and <span class="italic">The Man Stealers</span> (1900). Popularity came with two visionary tales in 1901. In <span class="italic">The Lord of the Sea</span> an English farmer gains control of the world's seaways, discovers he is a Jew, and seeks to solve the &#145;Jewish problem&#146; in England and Palestine. In <span class="italic">The Purple Cloud</span> the sole survivor of universal volcanic asphyxiation wanders Europe burning its dead cities until he finds a second survivor, a young woman, and is redeemed by love. What made these novels literary sensations was their grandiose sweep of imagination, the vigour and inventiveness of their prose, and Shiel's surreal images of obsession, hysteria, and horror.<br>
<br>By 1913 Shiel had published eleven more books, including <span class="italic">The Yellow Wave</span> (1905), inspired by the Russo-Japanese War, a story of interracial romance and intercontinental warfare, and <span class="italic">The Last Miracle</span> (1906), about a plot to undermine the church by creating and then exposing false miracles. In December 1914 Shiel was briefly imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs for reasons undetermined. During the war years he wrote plays that were never published. On 31 January 1919 he married Esther Lydia Furley (1872/3&#150;1943). His second creative period began in 1923 with <span class="italic">Children of the Wind</span>, an African adventure, followed by <span class="italic">How the Old Woman Got Home</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Here Comes the Lady</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">Dr Krasinski's Secret</span> (1929). Republication of four of his novels by Gollancz in 1929 helped revive Shiel's earlier reputation. His wife divorced him in 1929, and after occupying dozens of lodgings in London, Shiel settled in 1930 at L'Abri, a cottage near Horsham, Sussex. His last five books include a murder mystery (<span class="italic">The Black Box</span>, 1930), short stories (<span class="italic">The Invisible Voices</span>, 1935), and a science-fiction fantasy (<span class="italic">The Young Men are Coming</span>, 1937).<br>
<br>Shiel's thirty books varied greatly in theme and quality. The purple prose and frenzied emotion of the 1901 fantasies were never quite equalled, though &#145;frenetic vigour&#146; remained the hallmark of Shiel's style  (Morse, <span class="italic">Works of M. P. Shiel</span>, 480). His books embodied preoccupations of his time&#151;imperialism, the yellow peril, spiritualism, scientism, evolution&#151;and encompassed many genres&#151;adventure, romance, mystery, horror, fantasy, science fiction. At his best reminiscent of Poe and Wells, he could descend to potboilers and juvenilia. Misanthropy, racism, and antisemitism pervade his writing, as does fascination with a masterful, aspiring hero.<br>
<br>Shiel's only autobiographical essay, written when he was thirty-five, is brief and unreliable, and many facts about his life remain obscure. A semi-recluse, he wrote his last five books, received a civil-list pension through the efforts of his first bibliographer, John Gawsworth, and worked on a life of Jesus. Shiel died on 17 February 1947 at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, and was cremated on 24 February at Golders Green, London. After his death he became a cult figure.<br>
