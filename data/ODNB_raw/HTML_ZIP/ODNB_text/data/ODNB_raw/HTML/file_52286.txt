<span class="headword">Chamberlain <span class="st"> [Chamberlen]</span>,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1612), <span class="occ">linguist and physician</span>, was the third son of the barber&#150;surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5065/', "Peter Chamberlen the younger (1572&#150;1626)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58754/', "Chamberlen family")</script>] and his wife, Sara, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7452/', "William Delaune (c.1530&#150;1611)")</script>. He was baptized at the French church in London on 23 August 1612, and was educated at Merchant Taylors' School (1620&#150;24). He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1634, graduating BM in 1636. In his sole publication, <span class="italic">Tractatus de literis et lingua philosophica</span> (1679?), he claimed to have conceived the idea of a universal language while at Oxford and to have had the benefit of advice from two of his contemporaries at Pembroke, William Hill (1619&#150;1667) and Thomas Hunt (1611&#150;1683).<br>
<br>Chamberlain's first known employment, to which he was directed in 1643 by order of the House of Commons, was as a physician to the parliamentary army. After the civil war he lived in London for a time on friendly terms with the royalist Sir Thomas Urquhart, with whom, as he explains in the dedicatory epistle to the <span class="italic">Tractatus</span>, he frequently discussed the topic of universal language, Urquhart urging him to publish his ideas, even if they were not yet fully worked out. Chamberlain later moved to Dublin, possibly to join his elder brother Peter, who practised medicine there, and his former fellow student William Hill, now headmaster of the grammar school. The sixteen-page <span class="italic">Tractatus</span> appeared with no date or place of publication, but has been identified as almost certainly printed in Dublin in 1679.<br>
<br>The work consists of three parts: a dedicatory epistle containing biographical material, a section on orthography and pronunciation, and a third on the vocabulary and grammar of philosophical (that is, scientific) language. In the epistle, Chamberlain refers to some predecessors who had displayed an interest in universal language&#151;Francis Bacon, Thomaso Campanella, and Thomas Urquhart&#151;but he nowhere mentions the well-known <span class="italic">Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language</span> by John Wilkins (1619&#150;1672); and his ignorance of such an important work suggests that what he published in the <span class="italic">Tractatus</span> was the result of conversations with Urquhart which took place many years before Wilkins's <span class="italic">Essay</span> appeared in 1668. The work, however, is reasonably sophisticated, being more than a simplified version of an existing vernacular. Chamberlain intends to produce a language in which words are iconic, denoting in their structure the properties of the object signified. Chamberlain admits, however, that if every word must accord with the nature of the thing named, then the collaborative efforts of many learned men would be required, and the task would take them many years to complete. Thomas Hunt, however, suggested that Chamberlain should begin by producing a restricted vocabulary for the use of merchants who had to visit many different parts of the world, where a universal language would be so useful; but Chamberlain preferred a more theoretical approach, based on a limited number of &#145;radical&#146; words supplemented by their derivatives.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Tractatus</span> is recorded as surviving in a single copy in Marsh's library in Dublin, and has not been translated or re-edited. The work is not of major significance in the universal language movement of the seventeenth century, but is of some importance in indicating that interest in the topic did not disappear after Wilkins's <span class="italic">Essay</span> was published in 1668. Nothing further is known about Chamberlain's life.<br>
