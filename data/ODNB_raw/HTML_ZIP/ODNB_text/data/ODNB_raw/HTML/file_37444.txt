<span class="headword">Garway <span class="st"> [Garraway]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1617, <em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 10 April 1617 at St Peter-le-Poer, London, the eldest of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10405/', "Sir Henry Garway (bap. 1575, d. 1646)")</script>, draper and lord mayor of London in 1639&#150;40, of Broad Street, London, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1656), daughter of Henry Clitherow, merchant of London. He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1632. Garway's father was one of the staunchest royalists in the City during the civil war and Garway himself fought in the royal army as a captain of foot before being captured in November 1644.<br>
<br>Garway's activities after the death of his father in 1646 are obscure, although he may have succeeded to some of Sir Henry's Levantine business interests. In 1656 he inherited land in Sussex and in 1661 was returned to parliament for Chichester. Garway soon acquired a reputation for independence from the court, coupled with understanding of public finance. He became associated with a group around Sir John Vaughan including Sir Thomas Littleton and Sir Richard Temple, which established itself as the most consistent critic of the government. In 1663 he was involved in the efforts of Temple and George Digby, second earl of Bristol, to remove Edward Hyde, first earl of Clarendon, from power. With his allies he had opposed in 1664 aspects of the government's financing plans for the Second Dutch War, and during the session of 1666&#150;7 Garway was in the forefront of the group's demands for scrutiny of war expenditure, proposing a statutory committee to examine the accounts of the money which had been given for the war with the Dutch. Despite the failure of the bill to give effect to the committee Garway was one of the government's critics who were included in the royal commission on public accounts appointed during the following prorogation. With the fall of Clarendon and the rise to power of George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, an ally in the session of 1666&#150;7, Garway was appointed in 1668 to the committee of trade. Nevertheless, throughout 1669, often in concert with Sir Thomas Lee, he continued to press for further investigation of corrupt practices in government accounts, to argue for limits to the supply granted to the king and against the new assessment and excise taxes.<br>
<br>In 1671, however, Garway accepted a commissionership of the customs, and in February 1673 he and Sir Thomas Lee (who later admitted to receiving money from the government) supported the court in its request for &pound;1.2 million in order to carry on the war with the Dutch. Despite this, though, Garway continued to articulate suspicions of the court, and particularly its connections with popery. He criticized the French war and joined the attack on the members of the Cabal. In 1675 he attacked the granting of money for rebuilding the navy. At the end of the autumn session that year he was dismissed from his position as customs commissioner.<br>
<br>By the session of 1677 Garway was one of the most influential country voices in the Commons, demanding a hostile stance against France, but rejecting most of the policies advanced by the government to achieve it. But he maintained his distance from the most prominent of the government's opponents, Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, and Buckingham; during the Exclusion parliaments, in which he sat for Arundel, he demanded &#145;expedients&#146;&#151;measures against popery, frequent parliaments, the disbandment of the army, and the uniting of protestants&#151;as an alternative to the exclusion of the duke of York. Garway's resistance to exclusion perhaps earned him the respect of the government of James II. He was returned again to the 1685 parliament, and in 1688 was approved as deputy lieutenant and JP. Nevertheless he greeted the revolution with relief: in the Convention Parliament he was among the first to support William's coup, although he saw it as crucial to take the opportunity to make England's liberties more secure. As the new government consolidated itself Garway returned to his more customary role as the watchdog of the nation's purse: in 1689&#150;90 he was active in pursuing miscarriages in the supplying of the troops in Ireland. In the election of 1690 Garway finally lost his seat at Arundel. Although he lived for eleven more years he did not stand again.<br>
<br>The roots of Garway's country politics are not clear: Sir William Coventry told Pepys in 1666 that he had &#145;not been well used by the court, though stout to death&#146;  (Pepys, 7.310). But Garway's attitude and deep suspicion of successive Restoration administrations were tempered by an acknowledged expertise in public finance and a well thought out moderation on constitutional issues. He never married and died on 4 August 1701. He was buried at Ford, Sussex.<br>
