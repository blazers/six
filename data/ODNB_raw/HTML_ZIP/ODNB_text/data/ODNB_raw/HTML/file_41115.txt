<span class="headword">Harley,  (John) Brian</span>  (1932&#150;1991), <span class="occ">geographer and map historian</span>, was born on 24 July 1932 in Ashley, Bristol, and spent some of his infant years in Oxford. On 15 March 1935 he was adopted by John Jack Harley (<i>b</i>. 1883), farmer, and his wife, Emily Louise Rogers (1890&#150;1963), who lived in rural Staffordshire. He was given the name John Brian Harley. To his great delight, a few years before he died he met his natural mother, whom he had last seen on his fifth birthday. From 1943 to 1950 he attended the grammar school at Brewood near Wolverhampton, where the children exploited his family circumstances to make him miserable. However, he excelled at Brewood, gaining the school essay prize and representing the school at cross-country running and football.<br>
<br>Harley's two years of national service from 1950 to 1952 were spent in the army in Trieste, Egypt, and Cyprus and were a character-forming experience which surfaced occasionally in hilarious stories. Harley was not a favourite of the officer class: the army taught him to type as a punishment. Life at school and in the army left Harley with a strong sympathy for the underdog and contempt for those with status he felt they did not merit.<br>
<br>In 1952 Harley gained a place at Birmingham University. Personal distractions robbed him of his expected first in geography in 1955 but he won the W. A. Cadbury prize. Perhaps uncertain of an academic future, Harley decided to teach, gaining his diploma in education from University College, Oxford, in 1956. He then returned, however, to Birmingham for graduate work on the historical geography of medieval Warwickshire under the supervision of Harry Thorpe, whose speciality was to study past landscapes through maps. He took inspiration from Rodney Hilton, then working on the social structure of medieval Warwickshire, and whose Marxism suited Harley's own political ideology. Harley graduated PhD in 1960, publishing an important paper on population and agricultural trends as seen through the hundred rolls of 1279 in the <span class="italic">Economic History Review</span> the year before.<br>
<br>Harley married Amy Doreen (1921/1922&#150;1983), daughter of Frederick Chatten, a welder, at St Clement's Church, Nechells, Birmingham, on 14 December 1957. In the following September he began teaching at Queensbridge School, Moseley, but in the same month he was offered an assistant lecturership in geography at Liverpool University and took up the post in January 1959.<br>
<br>In Liverpool Harley turned to the history of cartography. His book <span class="italic">Christopher Greenwood, County Map-Maker</span> (1962), written at Hilton's suggestion, was a landmark in English map history. With the significant exceptions of one further paper on medieval Warwickshire and a chapter on &#145;England in 1850&#146; in H. C. Darby's <span class="italic">New Historical Geography of England</span> (1973), virtually all his subsequent output was on maps and map makers. At first he concentrated on English mapping, mostly of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. His work on the Ordnance Survey gave him a reputation beyond the academic realm. He was influenced and supported by R. A. (Peter) Skelton, head of the map room at the British Museum, who pointed him towards the mapping of North America, notably during the American War of Independence, and through the career of William Faden.<br>
<br>Harley formed lasting associations at Liverpool: as he wrote soon after leaving, &#145;I shall always remember that the really formative years of my life were spent at Liverpool&#146;  (letter to Robert Steel, 7 Oct 1969). He even admitted to &#145;occasionally missing the very different world enshrined somewhere between the Senior Common Room and the last night of a field week&#146;, but in 1969 Harley resigned from Liverpool to become sponsoring editor with the publishers David and Charles in Newton Abbot. This was a bold move for a man with a wife and three children. Harley commissioned a substantial number of works in fields entirely new for David and Charles; yet he hankered after the academic life, and by March in the following year a chance to return presented itself.<br>
<br>The death of the Montefiore reader in geography at the University of Exeter in 1970 left a vacancy for a historical geographer which Harley was appointed to fill, initially as a lecturer but from 1972 as the Montefiore reader. His writing at Exeter was dominated by the history of the Ordnance Survey. His notes on the popular David and Charles reprints of the old series one-inch maps (with A. G. Hodgkiss) led to more substantial syntheses in a series of co-authored regional volumes of facsimiles, text, and carto-bibliography. He wrote <span class="italic">Ordnance Survey Maps: a Descriptive Manual</span> (1975) and wrote a substantial part of the official history of the Ordnance Survey, which appeared in 1978. In 1985 Harley graduated DLitt by accumulation from the University of Birmingham, an achievement of which he was particularly proud.<br>
<br>From the early 1980s Harley turned his attention to a philosophical view of maps and their meanings. By 1986 he had virtually completed a book-length manuscript, &#145;The map as ideology&#146;. In contributions to journals, books, conferences, and symposia he revised his ideas and, shortly before he died, proposed a new book combining a selection of these essays with a guide to the map philosophy they expounded. This was published in 2001 under his own title, <span class="italic">The New Nature of Maps</span> (ed. P. Laxton). Harley showed how the map is more than a skilfully constructed artefact with geographical outlines. Absorbing ideas from art history and literary criticism, he revealed their hidden agendas: &#145;silences&#146; that speak, names that have other levels of meaning, signs and icons with subliminal messages; some reflecting deliberate propaganda, most reflecting cultural values unacknowledged by either the map maker or his society. Harley showed maps to be not just passive mirrors of landscape and society but potent agents of governments and tools of propaganda.<br>
<br>Yet despite Harley's obvious distinction and notwithstanding a huge international body of admirers, he failed to secure promotion and recognition in the British academic world. His perceptive, often blunt, and sometimes angry observations on academic life gained him an unjustified reputation as a difficult colleague, despite his success in forming scholarly partnerships and his being a good administrator who served on the councils of several learned societies, including the Institute of British Geographers (1971&#150;4). To professional frustrations were added personal tragedy: in 1983 his wife, Amy, died, followed less than a year later by his son John. Harley began to think of a new life in the USA. He was familiar with the country through fellowships and invitations to lecture (notably the Kenneth Nebenzahl lectures at the Newberry Library, Chicago, in 1974), but the main attraction was that in 1977 he and David Woodward, of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, had persuaded Chicago University Press to publish a multi-volume <span class="italic">History of Cartography</span> (1987&#150;). This dominated the rest of Harley's life, particularly after 1986 when he was appointed full professor of geography at Madison's Milwaukee campus. This multi-disciplinary project involving some 130 scholars worldwide is the first comprehensive history of maps in world cultures, a synthesis of existing and new research.<br>
<br>Harley continued his cartographic research outside the confines of the <span class="italic">History</span>. He was involved in controversies over the Columbus celebrations. He broadcast on the topic and wrote <span class="italic">Maps and the Columbian Encounter</span> (1990), the interpretative guide to a travelling exhibition of maps. He was due to give twelve public lectures on the topic in 1992.<br>
<br>Harley said that he wished to go out in full flood while lecturing. He did die suddenly and unwarned, of a heart attack as he arrived at his Milwaukee office on 20 December 1991. He was survived by his three daughters. He was cremated in December 1991 in Milwaukee, and his ashes were interred on 16 March 1992 at Highweek, Newton Abbot, Devon, after a memorial service. Harley's death deprived the <span class="italic">History of Cartography</span> project of his vision and panache, which would have come especially into their own in the volumes covering the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, periods in which his authority was supreme. Bearded and with alert eyes, Harley was an utterly single-minded, formidably hard-working scholar. He judged people by the quality of their discourse and their capacity for conviviality. Beneath his strongly held views lay a characteristic uncertainty, covered by a self-mocking modesty which failed to hide his enthusiasm for both the chase and the writing. He always wrote well with an unfailing nose for the comic and tragic sides of early cartographic projects, and his lectures turned potentially abstruse subjects into an eye-opening delight.<br>
