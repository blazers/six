<span class="headword">Dewhurst,  Wynford</span>  (1864&#150;1941), <span class="occ">artist and writer on art</span>, was born in Manchester on 26 January 1864. He was educated by a private tutor and subsequently at Mintholme College. Although originally destined for the legal profession, he showed an early artistic flair, contributing pen drawings and descriptive articles to journals in Lancashire and Cheshire, and to the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Budget</span> and <span class="italic">St James's Budget</span>. He spent five years studying art, in Paris, attending the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, where he was a pupil of Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;rome, and the ateliers of Julien and Colarosis, where he worked with William Bouguereau, Ferrier, and Benjamin Constant. Despite this eclectic bunch of teachers, Dewhurst's style was very strongly influenced by the impressionists, especially Monet, whose work he particularly admired and on whom he published an article in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</span> in 1900.<br>
<br>In 1896 Dewhurst exhibited at the Champ-de-Mars salons: over the next decade his work could be seen at a number of international exhibitions (including St Louis in 1904 and New Zealand in 1906), and in shows in Paris, London, and Venice. He exhibited in Buenos Aires in 1910, in Rome in 1911, and at the Royal Academy between 1914 and 1926. He also held two one-man shows in London (at the Walker Galleries in 1923 and at the Fine Art Society in 1925), and a series of solo exhibitions in Germany. Views of the countryside around Dieppe and of the Seine valley became his speciality: examples of his work are owned by Manchester City Galleries and by the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff. Dewhurst lectured on modern painting, and published on French landscapists in <span class="italic">The Artist</span> and <span class="italic">The Studio</span>, drawing attention to the influence of such artists as Constable, Turner, and Bonington on their work, and thus claiming English origins for the impressionist movement. Dewhurst was not the first to advance this thesis&#151;P. G. Hamerton had presented a similar argument some thirteen years earlier&#151;but his one book-length study, <span class="italic">Impressionist Painting: its Genesis and Development</span> (1904), dedicated to Monet, was more innovative. It anticipated developments in modern scholarship, looking at American and other continental painters in addition to the French; it also included a whole chapter on women painters, since &#145;modernity is the note of Impressionism, and that movement was the very first artistic revolt in which women took part&#146;  (Dewhurst, <span class="italic">Impressionist Painting</span>, 77).<br>
<br>In other respects, however, Dewhurst was wary of the new, claiming in 1913 that &#145;Philistine materialism grips the country as a vice&#146;  (Dewhurst, <span class="italic">Wanted</span>, 26), and singling out both the cinema and advertising hoardings for his disapproval. He was an active campaigner for artistic causes, particularly those with a conservationist bent. Lecturing, pamphleteering, and setting up committees, he argued for the formation of a ministry of art: the result was the establishment in 1913 of a council of royal commissioners for art. In 1922, concerned with the deteriorating condition of royal palaces, he started a press campaign in France to save these buildings. J. D. Rockefeller jun. gave &pound;100,000 towards the maintenance of Versailles, and Dewhurst's efforts also led to the introduction of entrance fees to state-owned palaces.<br>
<br>After a spell in Paris, Dewhurst was living in Leighton Buzzard in 1898, and again in 1907: he sat on Buckinghamshire county council between 1907 and 1910. Subsequently he moved to Tunbridge Wells, and then, in 1917, to Hampstead; he also maintained a house in France, in the department of Creuse. Dewhurst died on 9 July 1941, at 145 Belvedere Road, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, and was buried at Repton, in Derbyshire. He was survived by his wife, Antonia, with whom he had had three sons and three daughters.<br>
