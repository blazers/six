<span class="headword">Clegg,  Hugh Armstrong</span>  (1920&#150;1995), <span class="occ">industrial relations expert</span>, the fourth child and third son of Herbert Hobson Clegg, a Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Mabel Duckering, was born at Parkvedras House in Truro, Cornwall, on 22 May 1920. Educated at Kingswood School, Bath, the renowned Methodist public school, he reacted against his background, becoming an atheist and a member of the Communist Party as a teenager. This independence of mind, and his ability, were demonstrated by his election to the top scholarship (demyship) in classics at Magdalen College, Oxford, while insisting that he be allowed to read philosophy, politics, and economics, in which he took a first class in 1947 after five years of military service. In the army he showed his grasp of practicalities at the shop-floor level in becoming a skilled telephone engineer. On 28 June 1941 he married (Mary) Matilda Shaw (<i>b</i>. 1918/19), the elder daughter of George Shaw, a retired bank manager, and Mary Magowan; they had two sons and two daughters, and Clegg was a devoted and conscientious father.<br>
<br>Demobilized in 1945, Clegg soon found his communist faith undermined, crucially by his philosophy tutor, the redoubtable T. D. Weldon. By 1949, when he was elected a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, he was essentially a disillusioned empiricist, whose watchword he described, with some exaggeration, as being that &#145;an ounce of fact is worth a pound of theory&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). His early books were a mixture of the monographic and wider studies, on nationalization and industrial democracy, which revealed a touch of the surviving theoretician. From 1955 he was in demand as a candid friend of the unions in a series of public inquiries into disputes, and he also presided at Nuffield over convivial gatherings of employers, politicians, and union leaders in a search for the elusive consensus.<br>
<br>In his heyday Clegg was the most persuasive advocate of collective bargaining in the voluntarist tradition as a better answer than legislative interference to the problem of damaging relations between capital and labour. His greatest success came as a member of the Donovan commission on trade unions and employers' associations (1965&#150;8). He was largely responsible for its massive research and, by threatening a minority report, inveigled his colleagues into abandoning legal restraints in favour of trying to improve collective bargaining. The commission's modest proposals reassured the unions and modified the attitude of many employers; but during a turbulent decade they were not welcomed by most politicians, who became committed increasingly to legislative interference. Clegg's public service ended in 1980 as chairman of the committee on pay comparability. His last recommendations were reluctantly accepted by the Thatcher government and the committee was abolished.<br>
<br>In 1967 Clegg was appointed founding professor of industrial relations at Warwick University, which offered him novel scope and enhanced backing. He soon displayed his talents as an academic entrepreneur. Having helped to launch the new business school, he presided over the labours of capable assistants as director of the Industrial Relations Research Unit, who produced work which was, as he said too modestly, &#145;of some use to someone&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). But the strain of years had begun to tell, and he resigned his chair in 1979. Long into retirement, however, he kept in touch with his creation, the most respected centre of his favourite studies in the country, cycling in from Kenilworth whenever he could.<br>
<br>Clegg now concentrated on completing a long-delayed project, <span class="italic">A History of British Trade Unions since 1889</span>. The first volume, to 1910 (with A. Fox and A. F. Thompson), had been published in 1964; the second (1911&#150;33) followed in 1985, and the third (after 1933) in 1994, when his health was failing. This was a monumental achievement and remains pre-eminent in its detailed coverage of the whole range of trade-union development over a lengthy period. Here and elsewhere, Clegg has sometimes been criticized for failing to deal adequately with the social and political background to his masterly treatment of the institutional, procedural, and legal aspects of the subject. His mastery is also displayed in the other of the most important among his many books, <span class="italic">The System of Industrial Relations in Great Britain</span>, originally published in 1953 and revised in 1970 and 1979. Regarded for a generation and more as the indispensable textbook, it is voluminous and completely authoritative.<br>
<br>Clegg had an incisive, retentive mind, apparent in everything he attempted, on paper and in person. Once sure of his views, after weighing the evidence and the opinions of those he respected, he worked quickly, preferably alone, and wrote with a straightforward clarity in a field not noted for stylistic niceties. He could seem dour, even forbidding, but was essentially considerate and warm-hearted&#151;as became evident when he proved an excellent Oxford tutor and a fine supervisor of graduate students. Immensely loyal himself, he attracted loyalty from others, and was an engaging and often convivial colleague. (<span class="italic">Who's Who</span> recorded his recreations as &#145;walking and beer&#146;.) Impressively agile in committee, he was an outstanding manager of seminars but curiously pedestrian as a lecturer. Growing infirmity meant shorter walks and less of his cycling into Warwick. He never learned to drive and his lifestyle was remarkably simple. Mourned by everyone who knew him, he died in Warwick Hospital on 8 December 1995 of a cerebrovascular infarction.<br>
