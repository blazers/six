<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Albert Lancaster</span>  (1908&#150;1982), <span class="occ">ethnomusicologist and radio and television broadcaster</span>, was born on 29 February 1908 at 136A Trevelyan Road, off Tooting High Street, London, the son of Ernest Lancaster Lloyd, a draper's packer, and his wife, Mabel Emily Barrett. His father was an accountant's son from Islington, his mother a printer's daughter from Battersea. Details of his early life are sketchy; he lived in both London and Sussex and attended Hornsey grammar school, where he began his lifelong involvement with languages. At the age of sixteen, with his mother dead and his father, a war invalid, unable to look after him, Lloyd went to Australia as an assisted migrant.<br>
<br>In Australia Lloyd worked as a farm-hand and shepherd and had what was probably his first significant encounter with traditional songs. He began to jot these down in notebooks in order to remember what he encountered&#151;not, in any sense, as a folk-song collector. It was in his teenage years that Lloyd made use of library postal loans to continue his education. He also listened extensively to Western classical music on borrowed 78 r.p.m. records.<br>
<br>Lloyd returned to England in the early 1930s and lived near King's Cross, London. In a short space of time he encountered unemployment, the British Library reading room, a group of left-wing intellectuals including Dylan Thomas, Jack Lindsay, George Rud&eacute;, and A. L. Morton, and, via this group, the Communist Party. He remained a loyal member for the rest of his life. He worked for a time in Foyles foreign book department and started writing translations (including editions of Lorca's poems) and criticism. In 1937 and 1938 he worked as a labourer on a whaling ship and as a merchant seaman.<br>
<br>In 1940 Lloyd obtained a job as a journalist with <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, which (with some interruption for military service) lasted for about ten years. His regular partner on the magazine was the celebrated photojournalist Bert Hardy, and &#145;the two Berts&#146; created many acclaimed features. Lloyd's language skills enabled him to travel widely. He purposely suggested stories in parts of the world that he knew were &#145;musically lively&#146; and thus acquainted himself directly with a diversity of foreign folk musics. In the end Lloyd fell out with the owners of <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, who had become uneasy about Lloyd's political views in the growing cold war atmosphere. The proprietor, Edward Hulton, fired the editor, Tom Hopkinson, over the printing of a story felt to be &#145;politically too hot&#146;. Lloyd resigned in sympathy with Hopkinson, and resolved to make a living as a freelance writer and collector. During his period at <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, on 13 April 1946 he married Charlotte Maria Ohly (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of Jean Adam, an assistant bank manager; they had a daughter.<br>
<br>Lloyd's Communist Party connections were important in establishing him as a freelance. In the cold war atmosphere of the 1950s he had easy access, where others were denied, and was welcomed in eastern Europe. It is reported that he caused no little resentment among Soviet bloc folklorists because of the way in which he was able to obtain privileged access to their hard-won sources. Another important connection that sustained Lloyd was with the BBC. He had done some work in the late 1930s with producer Lawrence Gilliam on <span class="italic">The Voice of the Seaman</span>, a revolutionary piece of radio that made use of actuality, not actors. Soon after, he worked on <span class="italic">Shadow of the Swastika</span>, a drama documentary on the rise of Hitler. Lloyd's left-wing enthusiasms worried some at the BBC and his contract was not renewed. In spite of continuing suspicion, Lloyd produced many scripts in the post-war period, ranging from ethnomusicological work for the Third Programme to twenty-minute scripts for schools' broadcasts. A significant number of BBC personnel realized the uniqueness of his talents and made extensive use of him. In the 1970s he made a number of highly acclaimed television programmes with the film-maker Barry Gavin.<br>
<br>Lloyd was instrumental in the creation of the British folk music revival of the post-war period as both a writer and a performer. His pamphlet <span class="italic">The Singing Englishman</span> (1944), produced under wartime conditions, laid the foundation for his mature work, <span class="italic">Folk Song in England</span> (1967). In this book Lloyd combines the tradition of English folk-song scholarship, largely derived from Cecil Sharp, with the radical historiography of such people as A. L. Morton and E. P. Thompson. This is further fleshed out with understandings derived from American and eastern European folk music scholars. It is a heady concoction that fitted well with the spirit of the time; a seminal work which tried to unite disparate and perhaps incompatible elements. Perhaps Lloyd's most significant contribution was to map out the territory of what he called &#145;industrial folk song&#146;, the work of mainly mining and cloth making communities who continued producing songs into the earlier phases of industrialization. The book has attracted much scholarly criticism, sometimes mixed with deep admiration, since the time of its publication. Lloyd had a way of side-stepping questions which were inconvenient or did not fit with his particular perceptions of the world. He could always draw on a rich store of esoteric knowledge to confound his opponents.<br>
<br>Lloyd, together with Ewan MacColl, the Scottish actor turned singer, was the most important influence on the post-war British folk-song revival in the 1950s and 1960s. Some people objected to the way in which he altered and adapted traditional material, collating variants and creating versions that some thought were &#145;too good to be true&#146;. Numerous people attest to his generosity with his time and material, and to the encouragement he gave younger performers and scholars who were just beginning to discover the riches of traditional music. He bridged the gap between the first and second folk-song revivals in collaborating with Ralph Vaughan Williams on <span class="italic">The Penguin Book of English Folk Song</span> (1959), a classic collection which drew extensively on the work of pre-1914 collectors.<br>
<br>It is as a presenter and performer that many people remember Lloyd. He had an extensive repertory of English and Australian songs. The early experiences of hearing him sing could be likened to the opening of a door on to a fascinating, strange, and yet familiar country. His performances were characterized by his total involvement with the song. He often bore a wry smile. His voice took unexpected turns as he explored a song. His pitching was occasionally approximate, but many found his performances deeply satisfying. Most of all, he communicated his obvious delight in the songs he so valued and did so much to popularize. Lloyd died on 29 September 1982 at his home, 16 Crooms Hill, Greenwich, from pneumonia and heart failure, and was cremated. He was survived by his wife.<br>
