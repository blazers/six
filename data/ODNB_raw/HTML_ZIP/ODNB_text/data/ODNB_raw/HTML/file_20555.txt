<span class="headword">O'Donnell,  John Francis</span>  (1837&#150;1874), <span class="occ">journalist and poet</span>, was born in Limerick City, the son of a shopkeeper. He was educated by the Christian Brothers. He then learned shorthand, and when he was seventeen joined the <span class="italic">Munster News</span>, Limerick, as a reporter. At the same time he began to contribute verse to <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, for which he continued to write prose and poetry until his death. After two years on the <span class="italic">Munster News</span>, O'Donnell was appointed sub-editor on the <span class="italic">Tipperary Examiner</span>, published in Clonmel. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Kilkenny Journal</span>. In 1860 he went to London, to work for the <span class="italic">Universal News</span>, a weekly Roman Catholic and Irish nationalist paper. He also contributed verse to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> and <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>. He was married and had four children, but the name of his wife is not known.<br>
<br>In 1862 O'Donnell returned to Dublin to join <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, then edited by A. M. Sullivan; at the same time O'Donnell edited <span class="italic">Duffy's Hibernian Magazine</span>. In 1864, however, he returned to London to edit the <span class="italic">Universal News</span>, and in 1865 became sub-editor of <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>, where he remained until 1868.<br>
<br>It is not known whether O'Donnell was a Fenian, but he was one of their ablest propagandists in the press. From 1863 he wrote articles and contributed nationalist poetry to James Stephens's <span class="italic">Irish People</span> until it was suppressed in 1865. He also wrote for Richard Pigott's <span class="italic">The Irishman</span> and <span class="italic">The Shamrock</span> magazine. In all these papers he used the pseudonyms Caviare and Monkton West. In September 1873, through the Irish chancellor Lord O'Hagan, O'Donnell obtained an appointment in the London office of the agent-general of New Zealand. He died, after a brief illness, on 7 May 1874, in London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. O'Donnell published three collections of prose and poetry in his lifetime, and the Southwark Irish Literary Society published a posthumous edition of his poems in 1891.<br>
