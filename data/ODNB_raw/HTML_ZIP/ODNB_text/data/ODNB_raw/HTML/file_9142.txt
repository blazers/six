<span class="headword">Fane,  Robert George Cecil</span>  (1796&#150;1864), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 8 May 1796, the thirteenth and youngest child of the Hon. Henry Fane (1739&#150;1802), of Fulbeck, Lincolnshire, member of parliament, and Anne (1768/9&#150;1838), daughter of Edward Buckley Batson, banker, of London and Avon Tyrrell, Hampshire. Robert was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9133/', "Sir Henry Fane")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37122/', "Harriet Arbuthnot")</script>. He was educated at Charterhouse School from 1808 to 1813, and matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 22 May 1813. Subsequently he was a demy and fellow (1824&#150;35) of Magdalen College, Oxford, where he proceeded BA in 1817 and MA in 1819. Having never previously witnessed an execution, he was a keen spectator of the hangings of the Cato Street conspirators in May 1820. But according to his sister Harriet he could not bring himself to watch the drop &#145;which excited great contempt in the people who were in the room with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot</span>, 1.16). He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 1 June 1821, and soon enjoyed a considerable practice as an equity barrister.<br>
<br>In 1823&#151;the year in which his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/607/', "Charles Arbuthnot")</script>, retired as government patronage secretary&#151;the lord chancellor Lord Eldon appointed Fane a bankruptcy commissioner. On 2 December 1831 he was nominated by the whig lord chancellor Lord Brougham as one of the six commissioners who were to hold office under the new act establishing the court of bankruptcy. He married first, on 24 June 1835, Isabella Mary, youngest daughter of Admiral Sir Eliab Harvey GCB; she died at Rolls Park, Chigwell, on 15 December 1838. He married second, on 7 September 1841, Harriet Anne, only daughter of Admiral the Hon. Sir Henry Blackwood, bt; she died on 31 December 1869. With his first wife Fane had no children; with his second wife he had two sons, Lionel Arthur Cecil (1851&#150;1872) and Cecil Francis William (1856&#150;1914), and two daughters, Cicely Harriette (1845&#150;1933) and Blanche Anne (1846&#150;1935).<br>
<br>In later life Fane's judicial bearing was marked by an eccentricity of manner and &#145;occasional acerbity of temper&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), but although his decisions were frequently the subject of comment, very few of his judgments were reversed on appeal. He took an interest in railway schemes, and was for some years a director of the Eastern Counties Railway. As a member of the Law Amendment Society he was a constant attendant at the weekly meetings in Lancaster Place. He was the author of a number of articles, pamphlets, books, and published letters concerning the laws relating to bankruptcy, debt, and tenant right, including <span class="italic">Outline of a plan for improving the law of debtor and creditor, without abolishing imprisonment for debt</span> (1844); <span class="italic">Bankruptcy Reform, in a Series of Letters Addressed to Sir R. Peel</span> (2 vols., 1838); <span class="italic">Ministry of Justice; its Necessity as an Instrument of Law Reform</span> (1848), and <span class="italic">Tenant-Right, its Necessity as a Means of Promoting Good Farming</span>. Fane was an ardent lover of field sports, and was well known in the Leicester hunts; he occasionally appeared in court &#145;bearing the marks of injuries incurred in the chase&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). He was also a patron of the fine arts. He died &#145;somewhat suddenly&#146; at the Burdon Hotel, Weymouth, on 4 October 1864  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
