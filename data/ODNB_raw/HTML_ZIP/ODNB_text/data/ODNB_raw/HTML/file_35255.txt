<span class="headword">North,  John Dudley</span>  (1893&#150;1968), <span class="occ">aircraft designer</span>, was born at 18 Kinver Road North, Peak Hill, Sydenham, on 2 January 1893, the only child of Dudley North, solicitor, and his wife, Marian Felgate. He was educated at Bedford School where he learned the elements of the mathematics which he applied so skilfully until the end of his days. After leaving school he became an apprentice in marine engineering. While still an apprentice he won two competitions in <span class="italic">The Aeroplane</span>, edited at that time by Charles Grey. It was through Grey's advice that his apprenticeship was transferred to Horatio Barber's Aeronautical Syndicate at Hendon, and when that venture ended he joined the Grahame-White company. He was still only nineteen when he became its chief engineer. Between 1912 and 1915 he designed and supervised the construction of a number of aeroplanes, one of which was the first British aeroplane to loop the loop. The best-remembered product of this period of extraordinary precocity was the Grahame-White Charabanc which in 1913, piloted by Louis Noel, took nine passengers, including the youthful designer, into the air.<br>
<br>In 1915, North joined the Austin motor company as superintendent of its aeroplane division. In this post he was responsible not for design but for constructing the large numbers of RE7 and RE8 aircraft which the company produced for the Royal Flying Corps. At the end of 1917 he joined Boulton and Paul Ltd, of Norwich. As a consequence of the aircraft production work it had taken up during the war the company had decided to start a design department, and North was put in charge.<br>
<br>The first machine North designed was the Bobolink, a fighter. It was followed by the Bourges, a bomber&#150;reconnaissance aircraft of attractive design and remarkable performance. This aeroplane, of which there were several versions, was the first of a series of high-performance bombers. It was followed by the Bolton and the Bugle and, in 1927, by probably the most famous of North's aeroplanes, the Sidestrand. Towards the end of the 1920s there followed two single-seater fighters, the Partridge, which was a single-engine biplane and the Bittern, a twin-engine monoplane with a number of original features. The Air Ministry appeared to decide, however, that the forte of Boulton and Paul, and its successor (1934) in the aircraft field, Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd, was the bomber, and the next selected for service was the Overstrand. Towards the end of the series came the remarkable turret-fighter, the Defiant, which was used in the early days of the Second World War and aided the Dunkirk evacuation. The last aircraft production run, which came after the war ended, was on the Balliol, an advanced trainer for the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm. Thereafter the only aircraft of note were the delta research aircraft P111 and P120, the first to use Boulton Paul power controls. Few designers have to their credit a more remarkable series of aircraft, a testimony to North's outstanding fertility in invention and skill in engineering.<br>
<br>North was one of the first to move away from the wood and fabric of the First World War to the tubular and monocoque constructions of the later years. He was always close to the latest development in metal and plastic materials. His particular genius for design in metal was given an excellent opportunity in 1924 when Boulton and Paul became intimately associated with the design and construction of the R101 airship. Its sad fate should not be allowed to obscure the ingenuity of its structure. The overall design of the skeleton was the work of the Royal Airship Works, but the design of the individual girders, in some parts of the ship a matter of most complicated three-dimensional geometry, was the work of North and his team.<br>
<br>An outstanding characteristic of North's last bombers was their gun-turrets. As Boulton and Paul became famous for making powered turrets for a variety of aircraft, its work moved progressively away from complete aircraft to the increasingly complex parts thereof. In his last phase as a designer North concentrated more on powered controls&#151;including those of Concorde&#151;and on other powered devices within and without the aeronautical field.<br>
<br>It was North's ideas on control which led to his deep interest in control mathematics and cybernetics. He developed a wide-ranging knowledge of operational research, ergonomics, and statistics, on which he published several profound and imaginative scientific papers. North was a member of the council of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors from 1931 to 1962. It was as the society's nominee that he joined the council of the Air Registration Board and the governing body of the College of Aeronautics at Cranfield, on both of which he worked with characteristic dedication.<br>
<br>As engineer, as designer, and as applied mathematician, North was a great professional. As horticulturalist, gastronome, and cook, he was a great amateur, yet equal in skill to many professionals. He was an honorary fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society and in 1967 he became an honorary DSc of the University of Birmingham. In 1962 he was appointed CBE. Although he seemed indifferent to fame and his course was determined only by logic, he did not scorn recognition and when he was honoured he was greatly pleased. When his years of service to the Air Registration Board were appreciated by a modest presentation he was deeply touched. Perhaps, in his great modesty, he never felt neglected, but to those who knew him best he stood out as a person of distinction whose merit in his lifetime was comprehended by too few. This may have been because his integrity was complete and in things which mattered he could not compromise. North was a tall, heavily built man, bespectacled from youth. His voice was deep, his manner deliberate. On first meeting he could be a little frightening, but it was usually not long before his humour and kindliness came through.<br>
<br>North married in 1922 Phyllis Margaret, daughter of Edward Huggins, clerk to the Norwich board of guardians. They had two daughters. He died at his home, Eversley, in Oldbury, Bridgnorth, Shropshire, on 11 January 1968.<br>
