<span class="headword">Probus</span>  (<em>fl. </em>9th&#150;11th cent.), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the author of a life of St Patrick, which has been attributed to various dates in the period between the mid-ninth century and the eleventh. About eighty per cent of the text of the life is based on that by Muirch&uacute;, plus material from Patrick's own <span class="italic">Confessio</span> and the <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> of Tirech&aacute;n (though neither of these works was necessarily known to Probus). The author names himself as Probus in the final chapter of the life, in which he also mentions a <i>frater</i>, Paulinus, who seems to have requested the writing of the work. Although long known only through the sixteenth-century edition by Johann Herwagen of Basel (based on a lost manuscript), two copies have more recently come to light: an Italian manuscript of the eleventh or twelfth century in the Capitular Archives of the cathedral of Pistoia, near Florence; and the <span class="roman">Passional</span> of B&ouml;ddeken in Westphalia, dated to between about 1454 and 1459, now known only through later copies. Also, some eleventh-century glosses on Muirch&uacute;'s life in Vienna, Nationalbibliothek, MS ser. nov. 3642, seem to attest to an indirect tradition of parts of that by Probus.<br>
<br>The identity, date, and context for Probus have all been matters of uncertainty. Father John Colgan (<i>d</i>. 1658) suggested that Probus was an Irishman; and, having identified his friend Paulinus with M&aacute;el P&oacute;il mac Ailella (<i>d</i>. 922), abbot of Int Edn&eacute;n, near Slane in Meath, he suggested that Probus himself was C&oacute;enechair (Coinec&aacute;n), lector at Slane, who was killed by vikings in 950. However, the manuscript tradition of the life may suggest that the author was based on the continent, and Jean Mabillon, the seventeenth-century founder of modern diplomatic, identified Probus with the Irish monk Probus Scottus of Mainz (and perhaps previously at Rheims), whose death is recorded for 25 June 859. This Probus is addressed in a poem by Walahfrid Strabo of Reichenau, from whom he had requested various Latin texts via an intermediary called &#145;Chronmal&#146; (or Cr&oacute;nm&aacute;el in Irish), and his scholarly pursuits (including a liking for Virgil and Cicero) are mentioned in two letters by Lupus, abbot of Ferri&egrave;res. However, the number of errors in the life may indicate that the Mainz scholar could not have been the author, and the relative ignorance of Irish topography may indicate that the author was not an Irishman. Indeed, the change of Muirch&uacute;'s phrase &#145;our sea&#146; for the Irish Sea into &#145;the western sea&#146; suggests that he was from Britain, either a Briton or an Anglo-Saxon; and the apparent use of the name Scottia for Scotland, not attested before <i>c</i>.975, may indicate a date in the late tenth or, probably, the eleventh century for the work, if the relevant passage is not a later interpolation. Accordingly, it has even been suggested that Probus and his friend Paulinus were English monks associated with Glastonbury Abbey, which had a strong interest in the cult of St Patrick. However, the matter remains uncertain.<br>
