<span class="headword">Milne <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ross]</span>,  Christian</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1772, <em>d.</em> in or after 1816), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 19 May 1772 in Inverness, the daughter of Thomas Ross (<i>d</i>. in or before 1797), a cartwright, and his first wife, Mary Gordon, the daughter of a schoolmaster in Forres. Mary Gordon died while her daughter was very young, and about a year later, Ross married Mary Denton, formerly a gentleman's housekeeper, and moved with his family to Auchentaul, to be near his new wife's relatives. Christian Ross learned to read and write during the six months she was able to attend a dame-school in Auchentaul; she quickly developed a love for writing and read whatever literature she could find in her father's house, including <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, <span class="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</span>, and <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. At fourteen, she went out to service and began writing poetry, destroying most of it; a later mistress, the wife of Dr Jack of King's College, Aberdeen, accidentally found one of the poems and encouraged her to begin saving her work. On 16 August 1797 Christian married Peter Milne, then a journeyman ship-carpenter, but she continued to engage the interest of Aberdeen intellectuals, and, with their patronage and encouragement, she published a volume of poetry in 1805, which included an autobiographical sketch followed by a list of clergymen and academics prepared to testify to the truth of her story. Prefatory verses (not by Milne) describe her as &#145;the mean/Unletter'd&#151;female Bard of Aberdeen&#146; who has, quite extraordinarily, managed to write poetry even though she lives &#145;quite estranged from Nature's &#147;witching smile&#148;&#146;  (Milne, 8). She earned &pound;100 from the volume, which she used, years later, to purchase a sixteenth share in a boat built by her husband's employer. The subjects of the poems vary widely, from an affectionate anniversary poem addressed to her husband to patriotic exhortations to ship-carpenters to join the militia. Her political poems are topical and vehemently anti-Napoleonic; in one, she calls for the French to &#145;Set virtuous LOUIS on his throne&#146; in place of &#145;the vile Corsican&#146;  (ibid., 117). In both her autobiographical statement and her poetry, Milne presents herself as accepting the existing social order, but nevertheless she makes some sharp comments about the miseries suffered by her father during his attempts to escape poverty by honest labour; she is even sharper in her dismissal of allegations that she plagiarized her poems or that she neglected her household duties to write them. &#145;Spite and Ignorance&#146;, she proclaimed, are &#145;quite unfit to judge &hellip; the gift that Nature only can bestow&#146;  (ibid., 35). Milne's reputation seems to have been short-lived and mainly local, but her work was still well enough known in 1816 for the travel writer Elizabeth Isabella Spence to visit her during a trip to Aberdeen. Spence printed another autobiographical sketch of Milne's life, in which Milne describes years of ill health and the financial difficulties she has encountered in supporting eight children. While Spence describes Milne as being &#145;gentle in adversity&#146;  (1.56), Milne herself complains bitterly about &#145;the ridicule and contempt&#146; she has encountered from her peers  (ibid., 1.62) and strongly defends her decision to invest her literary income in a business venture rather than using it for day-to-day expenses. According to Milne, illness had prevented her from doing much writing since 1810, and apparently none of her work except the 1805 volume survives. Nor does she seem to have received much critical attention. <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, with a casual disregard for accuracy, dismissed her as &#145;a fisherman's wife, who writes poetry and sells oysters&#146;  (ibid., 3.429) in its mocking review of Spence's travelogue&#151;the closest it came to noticing Milne's work.<br>
