<span class="headword">Gilbert,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1448), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, is of obscure origins, and all that can be said of his family is that he had a brother named John. His date of birth is unknown, but the course of his university career suggests that he was born no later than 1382. First recorded in 1398 as a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, he vacated his fellowship in 1402, but in the same year received a licence to study for three years, and was probably living in Oxford between 1402 and 1404, when he rented a room at Exeter College. He was also a commoner of Oriel for six months in 1411 and 1412. He was ordained subdeacon on 15 February 1402 and priest on 31 March 1403. He had obtained a master's degree by 1405 and a doctorate in theology by 1413. He was several times involved in proceedings against heresy. About 1409 Oxford University named Gilbert to the committee of twelve scholars appointed to examine the works of John Wyclif and prepare a list of his errors. In 1414, together with Edmund Lacy (later successively bishop of Hereford and Exeter), he was appointed the bishop of Lincoln's commissary for a proposed visitation of Oxford directed against Lollardy. And in August 1415 books found on the convicted London heretic John Claydon were handed over to Gilbert and others for inspection.<br>
<br>Gilbert's obscure and presumably humble origins did not prevent his securing ecclesiastical preferment, starting with the Cheshire rectory of Mottram, to which he was presented in 1402. In the thirty-four years that followed before he became a bishop, he acquired another six rectories, seven prebends, and a number of substantial offices, starting with the precentorship of Lincoln in 1411 and that of Salisbury in 1418. In May 1417, during his absence at the Council of Constance, Gilbert was chosen by Archbishop Chichele to be warden of Merton College, Oxford, an office he held until 1421, and in November 1417 he attended Canterbury convocation and made a speech notable for its eloquence and clarity of argument in support of benefices for university graduates.<br>
<br>By 1416 or 1417 Gilbert had come to the attention of the king, for Henry V appointed him dean of the Chapel Royal. Having returned from Constance (where he spoke warmly in favour of the council's empowerment to undertake the reform of the church), later in 1417 he accompanied the king's army to Normandy, witnessing several battles&#151;he was later troubled in conscience over his wholehearted support for the English forces. The value that Henry V placed on Gilbert's services can be seen in the efforts the king was prepared to make to secure the archdeaconry of Durham for him, lasting for over a year in 1419&#150;20&#151;three royal mandates and a commission to establish Henry's right to present proved necessary. Continuing in royal service after the king's death, on 22 February 1423 Gilbert was appointed one of the English ambassadors to the Council of Pavia, and he received further important ecclesiastical preferment&#151;the treasurership of York in 1425, when the archiepiscopal see was vacant, the deanship of that cathedral in 1426 on the nomination of his friend Archbishop Kemp, and the deanship in 1430 of the royal free chapel of Tickhill, whose warden was another friend, Cardinal Henry Beaufort.<br>
<br>Until this point Gilbert's varied career had been one of steady advancement, but in March 1432 he suffered a serious setback, when Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, had him replaced as dean of the Chapel Royal. The change was one of several made in the royal household at this time, as the duke tried to bring the king's entourage under his own control, and Gilbert was clearly regarded as a supporter of Cardinal Beaufort with too much influence over the young Henry VI. Perhaps he did not expect to receive any further promotion, for in January 1433 he was admitted a residentiary canon of York&#151;&#145;perhaps the single most distinguished residentiary at fifteenth-century York&#146;  (Dobson, 207). But his fortunes soon revived. Between 1433 and 1437 Cardinal Beaufort's influence determined every promotion to the episcopal bench. On 15 January 1436 Robert Fitzhugh, bishop of London, died, and on 23 February following Beaufort used his control of the royal council to ensure the Gilbert was appointed to the see; he was consecrated bishop in the conventual church of the London Carmelites on 28 October.<br>
<br>Men advanced to the episcopal bench at this time were usually royal clerks who continued to serve the king thereafter. For at least a century all his predecessors as bishop of London had acted thus. However, Gilbert is not known to have held any office of state or to have gone on any diplomatic mission after he became a bishop, but confined his involvement in the processes of central government to attendance at meetings of parliaments and great councils&#151;he was a trier of petitions at the first four of the five parliaments held during his episcopate, and attended meetings of the great council in 1436, 1437, and 1443. In 1441 Archbishop Chichele named him to the tribunal set up to try Eleanor, duchess of Gloucester, who had been accused of witchcraft. His appointment is not surprising in view of his expertise in matters of theology and heresy. Gilbert's participation in local government was hardly more extensive. He was appointed a justice of the peace in Essex on three occasions, in Hertfordshire twice, and in Middlesex five times. He was twice appointed to raise loans in Essex, and himself lent the king a total of &pound;383 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. And as bishop he used the patronage at his disposal for the benefit of royal clerks: sixteen of the thirty-one clerks whom he collated to dignities and prebends in St Paul's were in some way engaged in the service of the crown.<br>
<br>Gilbert is known to have spent at least a part of every month of his twelve-year episcopate in his diocese, and appears to have conducted its affairs personally, despite advancing years and illness. Entries in his register show him carrying out such routine business as collations and institutions to benefices, and attempting to deal with the financial and disciplinary problems of his clergy. Harmony and co-operation characterized his relations with the chapter of St Paul's, notwithstanding visitations in 1437 and 1443. On 20 October 1438, acting at the request of a group of non-resident canons, Gilbert settled a dispute over the distribution of bread and beer. It is not known exactly when he died. He was still alive on 14 July 1448, when his will was drawn up, but had died by 27 July, when the dean and chapter of St Paul's notified Archbishop John Stafford of his death. His testament does not suggest great personal wealth. He made a modest number of cash bequests, including gifts of money to every house of friars in his diocese and &pound;40 for distribution among the poorer churches of the diocese to provide them with ornaments, but more often he left pieces of plate, books, and&#151;to his servants&#151;bedding. He bequeathed to St Paul's his pastoral staff, his pontifical books, and his mitre, bought from the executors of his predecessor, Robert Fitzhugh. He left the choice of his place of burial to his executors, specifying only that the funeral expenses should be modest, but it is not surprising that he was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, on 31 July 1448.<br>
