<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aston,  William George</span>  (1841&#150;1911), <span class="occ">diplomatist and Japanese and Korean scholar</span>, was born on 9 April 1841 near Londonderry, one of the five children of George Robert Aston, minister of the Unitarian Church of Ireland and schoolmaster. He was educated at Saintfield national school in co. Down and in 1859 he matriculated at the Queen's College, Belfast, where he had a distinguished career: he took his BA in 1862, receiving a prize for his results in Latin and Greek, and his MA in modern languages and history in 1863; in 1882 the college awarded him an honorary DLitt. In 1871 he married Janet (<i>d</i>. 1908), daughter of R. Smith of Belfast; they had no children.<br>
<br>Aston joined the consular service in 1864 and was appointed student interpreter at the British legation in Edo, where his task, like that of his colleague Ernest Satow, was to learn Japanese for the conduct of consular business. He soon became acquainted with prominent discontented samurai who were later to play significant roles in the Meiji restoration of 1868: from them he and Satow derived a good understanding of the turbulent politics of the day. He rose in the service to become interpreter and translator to the legation in 1870, and as such he accompanied the Iwakura mission, which included several senior government ministers, during its visit to Britain from August to December 1872. In an anonymous article he contributed to <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> he explained the purpose of the mission and applauded the commitment to westernization that it betokened. He clearly sympathized with the Meiji government's desire for greater centralization of political and economic power.<br>
<br>Aston was subsequently appointed assistant Japanese secretary to the legation (1875) and consul at Nagasaki (1882). In 1884 he was appointed consul-general for Korea and was the first British diplomat to reside in Seoul. He had been learning Korean for a number of years, and in 1880 had prepared a set of notes on Korean grammar for Satow, who understood Aston to be fluent in the language. In 1882 he had accompanied Vice-Admiral Willes on his mission to Korea as interpreter, and had made several further trips in 1883 to negotiate the treaty that inaugurated Anglo-Korean relations. In Seoul he assisted Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. in pursuing its commercial interests, but the political situation worried him: he reported in September 1884, &#145;I have come to the conclusion that the government of Korea is in a thoroughly rotten condition, and I fear that there will be no reform without some violent change&#146;  (W. Aston to Parkes, 19 Sept 1884, Parkes MSS, CUL). In December he was present at a dinner party where those opposed to reform were assassinated; the surviving guests departed in confusion, and exposure to the cold night air brought on a pulmonary attack which threatened Aston's life. He recovered to be appointed Japanese secretary to the legation in Tokyo in 1886, but in 1889 he retired on grounds of ill health and was made CMG. The remainder of his life he spent at Beer, Devon, where he devoted himself to his studies of Japan.<br>
<br>Aston's facility with both the written and spoken forms of the Japanese language is apparent from his numerous official translations of Japanese documents, and it inspired some of his earliest publications. <span class="italic">A Short Grammar of the Japanese Spoken Language</span> first appeared in 1869, intended &#145;for the use of merchants and others&#146;; the fourth edition of 1888, which was completely rewritten, represented the first description of the Japanese language by a Westerner to eschew the grammatical categories of European languages, and the first attempt to capture the internal logic of Japanese. His <span class="italic">Grammar of the Japanese Written Language</span> (1872; rev. edns, 1877 and 1904) was similarly successful and highly regarded; much more scholarly in tone, it was based on his extensive study of the works of Japanese grammarians. Following visits to Okinawa and to Hokkaido, he wrote in 1879 an account of the Loochooan (Ryukyuan) and Ainu languages, establishing that the former was merely a dialect of Japanese and the latter quite unrelated to Japanese or Korean. In the same year he was the first to demonstrate that Japanese and Korean were related, and his arguments are still worthy of consideration.<br>
<br>It was in retirement that Aston made his major contributions to the study of Japan. His translation of the <span class="italic">Nihon shoki</span> (&#145;Chronicles of Japan&#146;) was first published in 1896: it remained in print throughout the twentieth century as the standard translation of this difficult eighth-century text. His <span class="italic">A History of Japanese Literature</span> (1899) was for eighty years the most thorough work of its kind in English; it broke new ground in dealing with contemporary literature and in perceiving literary merit in works considered morally objectionable by Japanese scholars. His last major work was <span class="italic">Shinto</span> (1905), a study of indigenous Japanese religion that suffers from his concentration on philological study of the early texts. Aston has tended to be overshadowed by Satow's more glamorous career, and he was more self-effacing by temperament, but his extensive contributions as a scholar, which include numerous articles on the languages, literatures, and history of Japan and Korea, were highly valued in his own time and some long continued to be cited. Aston died at his residence, The Bluff, Beer, Devon, on 22 November 1911. His valuable collection of Japanese books was bought by Cambridge University Library in 1912 for &pound;250.<br>
