<span class="headword">Lake,  Edward John</span>  (1823&#150;1877), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Madras on 19 June 1823, was the son of Edward Lake (<i>d</i>. 1829), major in the Madras engineers, who served with distinction in the Anglo-Maratha War of 1817, and was author of <span class="italic">Sieges of the Madras Army</span>. Sent to England with a sister at an early age, Edward was left an orphan when six years old by the sinking at sea of the ship <i>Guildford</i>, in which his parents with their four younger children were returning home. He was brought up by his grandfather Admiral Sir Willoughby Lake, who sent him to Mr Stoton's private school at Wimbledon. He afterwards entered Addiscombe College (1839&#150;40), passing in three terms instead of the usual four and winning the first mathematical prize. Commissioned second lieutenant, Bengal Engineers, on 11 June 1840, he spent a year at the Royal Engineer Establishment, Chatham, and then went to India. He arrived on 30 July 1842, and was posted to the Bengal Sappers and Miners at Delhi.<br>
<br>Shortly after his arrival at Delhi, Lake was sent with a company of sappers to suppress an outbreak at Kaithal, near Karnal, where he made the acquaintance of Henry and John Lawrence. He was for a time employed in road making under Henry Lawrence. He was promoted lieutenant on 19 February 1844. During the autumn of 1845 he served as a settlement officer in the Ambala district under Major George Broadfoot. On the outbreak of the First Anglo-Sikh War that year he was ordered to the Sutlej, and joined Lord Hardinge in time to be present at the battle of Mudki on 18 December, when he had a horse shot under him and was himself severely wounded in the hand. After the battle he was sent to the frontier station of Ludhiana, where he strengthened the defences and forwarded troops and supplies to the army in the field. When Sir Harry Smith's camp equipage fell into the hands of the enemy just before the battle of Aliwal&#151;at which Lake was present&#151;Lake was able to replace it, and received the commendation of the governor-general.<br>
<br>On the restoration of peace in March 1846, the trans-Sutlej territory of the Jullundur Doab was made over to the British as a material guarantee. John Lawrence was appointed commissioner for the newly acquired territory, and Lake was nominated one of his assistants and placed in charge of the Kangra district, with headquarters at Nurpur, but was soon moved to Jullundur. In May 1848, when Sir Henry Lawrence, the commissioner of the Punjab, had left India on furlough to England, open hostility was shown by Mulraj, governor of Multan, and his turbulent Sikhs; Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew and Lieutenant Anderson were murdered, and the Punjab was ablaze. Herbert Edwardes, who was in political charge of the Dera Ismail Khan district and nearest to Multan, hastily collected a body of Pathans and managed to hold his own against Mulraj. Lake was specially selected as political officer to the friendly Muslim nawab of Bahawalpure, whose territories adjoined the Punjab, and in virtual command of the nawab's troops he co-operated with his old friend Edwardes. He took part on 1 July in the second battle of Suddoosam, close to Multan, and for seven months was engaged in the operations for the capture of Multan before it fell. Lake, then only a lieutenant like Edwardes, was in fact commander-in-chief of the Davodpootra army, and although directed to co-operate with Edwardes, and in no way under his orders, he nevertheless magnanimously subordinated himself, and was content to do his utmost to further his friend's plans. On the fall of Multan, Lake was again in the field, and took part in the final victory of Gujrat on 21 February 1849. He accompanied General Gilbert to the Indus in his pursuit of the Afghans, and was present at Rawalpindi when the Sikh army laid down its arms.<br>
<br>Lake next went to Batala, and for two years had charge, under John (afterwards Lord) Lawrence, of the northern portion of the country between the rivers Beas and Ravi. In 1852 he went home on furlough, travelling through Russia, Prussia, Norway, and Sweden. He returned to India in 1854, having been promoted captain on 21 August and brevet major on 22 August for his services in the Punjab campaign. He took up his old charge in the trans-Sutlej province at Kangra as deputy commissioner. In 1855 he was appointed commissioner of the Jullundur Doab. When the Indian mutiny broke out in 1857, Lake occupied and secured the fort of Kangra against the mutineers, and held it until the rising was suppressed. His calmness and resource were an asset to the government throughout the crisis.<br>
<br>In 1860 Lake's health failed, and he was obliged to go to England. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 18 February 1861. In July 1861 he married Elizabeth Penrose, youngest daughter of T. Bewes of Beaumont, Plymouth; their only child died at Lahore in 1864. Lake returned to his post at Jullundur in the same year. In 1865 he was appointed financial commissioner of the Punjab, and the following year was made a CSI. In 1867 ill health again compelled him to go to England, and subsequently to decline Lord Lawrence's offer of the much coveted appointment of resident of Hyderabad. He had been promoted colonel on 31 December 1868. On 1 January 1870 he retired on a pension with the honorary rank of major-general. After he left India the Lake scholarship was founded by public subscription in January 1870 in his honour at the Lahore high school.<br>
<br>About 1855 Lake had undergone a religious conversion. In India he held <span class="roman">Bible</span> study for officers, and <span class="roman">Bible</span> readings for soldiers, and helped missions. He became in 1868 honorary secretary of the East London Mission Relief Fund, of which his friend Lord Lawrence was chairman, and worked hard between 1869 and 1876 as honorary lay secretary of the Church Missionary Society. From April 1871 to June 1874 he was sole editor of the <span class="italic">Church Missionary Record</span>, and contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Church Missionary Intelligencer</span>, the <span class="italic">Sunday at Home</span>, and other publications. In 1873 he edited the fifth edition of the <span class="italic">Church Missionary Atlas</span>, and was engaged on another edition at the time of his death. He disliked &#145;departures from the simple forms of a reverent and reasonable service&#146;  (Barton and Maclagan, 79).<br>
<br>Lake was a man of slight and delicate frame, with a cheery and lovable disposition. He had great aptitude for business, and much tact in relations with Indians, who called him Lake Sahib, and by whom he was reportedly much loved. Lord Lawrence, Sir Robert Montgomery, and other eminent administrators had a very high opinion of him. In the summer of 1876 lung disease made it necessary for Lake to move from London to Bournemouth, and in the following spring he went to Clifton. He died at 10 Prince's Buildings, Clifton, near Bristol, on 7 June 1877, and was survived by his wife. He was buried on 13 June in Long Ashton churchyard, near Clifton.<br>
