<span class="headword">Borlase, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1562&#150;1629), <span class="occ">politician and benefactor</span>, was the only son of John Borlase (<i>d</i>. 1593) and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1622), daughter of Sir Robert Lytton of Knebworth, Hertfordshire. Although the family of Borlase or Burlace was Cornish in origin William's paternal grandfather, Edward, had prospered as a London mercer, and also through his three marriages; the children of these included two William Borlases, sons of his second and third marriages, who need to be distinguished from the subject of this article. Edward's first marriage, to Pernel, the daughter of Chief Justice Sir John Baldwin, enabled John, as their eldest son, to inherit estates at Nether Upton and Preston Bissett from his father-in-law, and thus to establish the Borlases among the leading gentry families of Buckinghamshire. Twice appointed sheriff for that county, in 1567 and 1588, John also acquired the manor of Little Marlow, a fifth share at a time, starting in 1561, and was thus able to transmit the whole of it to William as his heir.<br>
<br>Little is known of William Borlase's early life or education, except that he was admitted to Gray's Inn on 21 October 1584. Following his father's death he acted quickly to extend and consolidate his holdings, acquiring a reversion upon the manor of Ludgershall in 1593. He disposed of Preston Bissett in 1594, and the following year bought property in the parish of Medmenham, just a few miles from his estate at Little Marlow, including the manor of Medmenham and what became the family seat at Bockmer or Bockmore. In 1601 he served as sheriff of Buckinghamshire, and his status was confirmed on 28 June 1603 when he was knighted by James I.<br>
<br>By 1594 William Borlase had reinforced his position among the Buckinghamshire gentry by his marriage to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1625), daughter of Nicholas Backhouse, whose recent forebears, like William's own, had been prominent London merchants before establishing themselves as Buckinghamshire landowners during the second half of the sixteenth century. The alliance of the two families was a double one, for William's sister Elizabeth married Mary's brother Samuel. There are hints that William Borlase himself had overseas trading interests, perhaps through connections with the Merchant Adventurers. In August 1604 John Chamberlain recorded that it had been &#145;heard lately from Sir Will: Borlas that the Hollanders went about to intercept him between the ship and shoare&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 197). An assiduous newshound and letter writer, Chamberlain seems for some years to have made a habit during July and August of staying with Sir William and his Buckinghamshire connections, and they, in their turn, sometimes went to London in the autumn. Alluding to their imminent arrival in October 1608, Chamberlain assured his correspondent Dudley Carleton that &#145;you may be sure to meet with a whole knot of goode fellowship&#146;  (ibid., 266).<br>
<br>Chamberlain clearly counted Borlase among his friends. He actively assisted Sir William in dealing with the latter's eldest son, also William, who attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where in August 1605 he appeared as a scholarly disputant in a play performed before King James. After taking his degree he embarked on a European tour with the son of Sir Rowland Lytton, his kinsman by marriage, but the two ventured only as far as La Rochelle before retreating to Blois, where they remained &#145;at pawne for lacke of money, whereby their friends are nothing pleased having furnished them very sufficiently&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 272). With the authority of the ailing Sir Rowland, Chamberlain conferred with Sir William Borlase and in January 1609 arranged for the safe return of the two young men. Another eminent acquaintance was Ben Jonson. Sir William appears to have taken up painting as a hobby, producing a portrait of Jonson, which he sent to the playwright with a verse. It began<blockquote>
<div>To paint thy Worth, if rightly I did know it,<br>
</div>
<div>And were the best painter halfe like thee, a Po&euml;t,<br>
</div>
<div>Ben, I would shew it<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Jonson was tactful enough not to comment on these lines, and penned instead an affectionate verse reply, concluding:<blockquote>
<div>Yet when of friendship I would draw the face,<br>
</div>
<div>A letter'd mind, and a large heart would place<br>
</div>
<div>To all posteritie; I will write Burlase.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, 8.226&#150;7)</blockquote>Sir William Borlase was a conscientious, if hardly distinguished, MP, who shared many of the concerns of his fellow members. On 21 March 1610 he moved to give higher priority to a complaint against purveyance, and on 7 July following he was among the twenty MPs who transmitted ecclesiastical and temporal grievances to the king. Landowners worried that any agreement to end purveyance might remain legally vulnerable to assertions of the royal prerogative, and it seems possible that Sir William's own experience may have hardened his attitude on the issue. He (and others) found themselves in trouble in 1610 for refusing to compound with the crown over allegedly defective property titles in Barnwood Forest, Buckinghamshire (a similar dispute over lands in Windsor Forest was settled in November 1619). In 1614 Sir William was returned as one of the knights of the shire for Buckinghamshire. In the parliament's single brief session he sat on the committee for privileges, and was named to a delegation to attend a joint conference with the Lords.<br>
<br>By this time John Chamberlain's health had deteriorated to the extent that he seldom visited Little Marlow. Five years later, in July 1619, he reported that Borlase himself was unwell, afflicted by the stone. Sir William's second son, Henry, of the Middle Temple, who was MP for Aylesbury in 1621 and for Marlow in 1624, died in the latter year of unknown causes. His father was deeply affected by this loss, which was soon followed by that of his wife, after a long illness; she was buried on 18 July 1625 in Little Marlow church. Nevertheless Sir William remained active in county affairs, and in the autumn of that year received a letter from the duke of Buckingham enclosing council instructions for the disarming of Roman Catholic recusants. He was not afraid to voice opposition to what he perceived as injustices, for instance to the forced loan of 1626. His old friend John Chamberlain died in March 1628, leaving Borlase a gold ring.<br>
<br>Four years earlier, in 1624, Borlase had begun the construction of the school for which he is remembered. Perhaps the impetus came from personal sorrow, for an inscription on the porch of the original schoolhouse (which survives on the north side of West Street, Little Marlow) records it as having been built in memory of &#145;my good son&#146;. It seems that during the rest of his life Sir William devoted much time and effort to the construction, organization, and endowment of the school, which appropriately bears his name. Through gifts and bequests he provided it with a generous yearly income of &pound;58 from estates in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire; governors were appointed from among the townsmen of Great and Little Marlow and from Medmenham. The school was to educate boys between the ages of ten and fourteen whose parents, or other relations, had not the means to pay for their tuition. Primers and psalters, and two reams of paper per annum, were to be provided for each pupil. The schoolmaster, who was to have a salary of &pound;12, more than many beneficed clergy, and to be provided with a house and garden, was to take twenty-four boys and teach them to read, write, and do sums; on their becoming competent in these skills, &#145;which I conceive in about 2 years they will be ready to doe&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Buckinghamshire</span>, 2.214), six of the most able were to be awarded &pound;2 per annum apiece to secure their apprenticeship in an appropriate trade, along with a blue cap and gown as a mark of their &#145;graduation&#146;. Vacancies were to be filled promptly by the governors, so that the number of students remained at twenty-four.<br>
<br>Sir William Borlase died on 4 September 1629, probably at Little Marlow, and was buried on the 10th in Little Marlow church, where he had requested interment &#145;neere my late deare and loveinge wife&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/156, fol. 282<i>v</i>). His boys' school had been functioning for at least a year, for Borlase remembered the master in his will, completed on 29 August 1628 and proved on 20 November 1629. It contained further charitable provisions, most notably for a dwelling place and school for twenty &#145;weomen children&#146; of Great Marlow. The girls, who were to be selected by the governors from nominations submitted by the churchwardens and overseers, were to be taught spinning, knitting, and lacemaking. This endowment also provided for a workhouse for Great and Little Marlow, together with Medmenham. Its overseer was &#145;to whip all such offenders&#146; as the petty constables or other officers should bring to him and to &#145;keep for four days in his house of correction any rogue or vagabond taken within the town or parish of Great and Little Marlow and Medmenham&#146;  (Plaisted, 114).<br>
<br>Although Sir William clearly thought that the poor needed discipline as well as charity, he was generous to his own servants and his affection for &#145;my good sonne&#146; and his grandchildren is evident. In his will he commented that:<blockquote>I give nothing to my grandsonnes and little to my granddaughters by this will because I leave it wholly to bee disposed and done by my sonne of whose true care to his Children (I thanke god) I have just cause to rely &amp; bee confident. (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/156, fol. 283<i>v</i>)</blockquote>His principal estates in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire passed to his eldest son, William, knighted by King James in 1617, who married Amy, daughter of Sir Francis Popham of Littlecote, Wiltshire, and was MP for Wycombe in 1627 and 1628. The second Sir William died in 1630, only a year after his father, and was succeeded by his own eldest son, John (1619&#150;1672), who also sat in the House of Commons, representing Great Marlow in April 1640 and Corfe Castle from January 1641 until he was disabled in March 1644 following his departure to the king at Oxford. The last of Sir William's direct male descendants died in 1689, but his foundation continued as an elementary charity school until 1880, when it was reorganized under the <span class="roman">Endowed Schools Acts</span>, to reopen in the following year as a grammar school. Sir William's schoolhouse survives at the core of what is now a voluntary-aided co-educational grammar school serving Marlow and the surrounding area.<br>
