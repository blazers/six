<span class="headword">Waugh,  John</span>  (1661&#150;1734), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was born on 2 February 1661 at Scattergate, Appleby, Westmorland, the eldest son of John Waugh (<i>d</i>. 1690), yeoman farmer of Appleby, and his wife, Margaret. After attending Appleby grammar school Waugh entered Queen's College, Oxford, as a bateller on 31 January 1679 and matriculated on 4 April aged eighteen. He was elected a tabardar on 3 July 1684, graduated BA five days later, and proceeded MA on 7 July 1687. On 18 January 1688 he was elected a fellow of his college and in that same year was ordained deacon and priest by the bishop of Oxford. He held his fellowship for eleven years, and had the distinction of being described as &#145;a great tutor&#146; by the usually dismissive Thomas Hearne  (Hearne, 1.216). It is possible that Hearne, writing in 1706, was referring to the quantity rather than the quality of Waugh's teaching, as at the same time he argued that Waugh was &#145;all along a favourer of ye Whiggs&#146;  (ibid.) and thus an opponent of the tory and high-church Hearne in national and church politics.<br>
<br>Waugh left Oxford on his appointment on 23 January 1699 to the lectureship at St Bride's Church, London, serving also in one of the chapels of ease in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He received the degrees of BD and DD that same year. On 19 October 1699, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he married Elizabeth Fiddes (<i>d</i>. 1716), a thirty-year-old widow, possibly <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simpson. They had one son and three daughters. In 1704 he was appointed rector of St Peter Cornhill, London, an appointment which he held until his death and which assumed considerable importance in his life. St Peter Cornhill was acknowledged as a &#145;good Living&#146;  (Hearne, 1.216). Its wealth and its location suited Waugh's ambition, although he was an active and attentive rector. In London he was part of the circle of William Nicolson, bishop of Carlisle. Other members of the group, which had a close association with Queen's College, Oxford, were William Lancaster, for whose election as provost of the college in 1704 Waugh campaigned, and Edmund Gibson, a near-contemporary of Waugh at Queen's. Both Lancaster and Gibson were from Westmorland, like Waugh, and exhibited a political pragmatism that drew them towards the whigs; it may be that &#145;honest Dr Waugh&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Diaries of William Nicolson</span>, 500) moved to a whig position with them. He supported Nicolson's campaign to include Carlisle Cathedral in his episcopal visitation and so erode the authority of the dean, the high churchman Francis Atterbury, ultimately vindicated in the <span class="roman">Cathedrals Act</span> of 1708. By 1711 both Waugh and Gibson were &#145;earnest friends to the Duke of Marlborough&#146;  (ibid., 538).<br>
<br>Retaining the rectory of St Peter, he accepted other preferments. On 29 March 1718 he was collated as prebendary of Castor, one of the wealthier stalls in Lincoln Cathedral, probably a consequence of Waugh's friendship with Gibson, by now bishop of Lincoln. He was installed as dean of Gloucester on 5 August 1720. Waugh was not an active dean; in the three years of the post he attended only four chapter meetings and conducted no business of significance. Following Gibson's recommendation to the secretary of state, Charles, second Viscount Townshend, who managed ecclesiastical patronage for George I, on 23 August 1723 Waugh was elected bishop of Carlisle; he was consecrated at Lambeth by William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, on 13 October 1723. Waugh was the last of a series of local men of yeoman ancestry, all educated at Queen's College, Oxford, who were appointed to the see. He was allowed to retain the living of St Peter Cornhill, because the diocese of Carlisle was too poor to support Waugh in episcopal state. Edmund Gibson told William Nicolson that Waugh regretted leaving Gloucester for Carlisle, as he forfeited an income of &pound;300 a year as dean. The total income of Carlisle diocese was probably not much more than the &pound;800 a year enjoyed by his predecessor but one, Nicolson, and barely enough to cover the expenditure undertaken by the bishop in administering the diocese. Waugh in any case preferred to live close to the centre of power in London and appears to have enjoyed officiating as an episcopal rector at St Peter Cornhill, where the burials of two of his daughters, Bridget (1704&#150;1710) and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1713), and of his wife would have consolidated the bond.<br>
<br>Hearne thought Waugh had been &#145;all along aiming at a Bpprick, &amp; never mattered how he got it. He was look'd upon, when at Oxford &amp; in other places, as a tolerable good Preacher, but hath no Reputation for Learning&#146;  (Hearne, 8.126). As with his time as dean of Gloucester his achievements at Carlisle were thought negligible and his appearances in the diocese were rare. Like his predecessor he did not conduct a general visitation of the whole diocese, or the cathedral, and evidence for visitations within the diocese is poor. Most years he conducted two ordinations, in May or June and in August, usually at the bishop's residence, Rose Castle, but occasionally in the cathedral. At least eleven of Waugh's sermons were published in his lifetime, but under the terms of his will he left his papers to his son &#145;with this express order that none of them be printed but that he keep them for his own use or destroy them as he thinks fit&#146;  (Wagner, 447).<br>
<br>From 1727 Waugh relied increasingly on his son, another <a name="cosubject_95427"></a><span class="headword">John Waugh</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1701, <em>d.</em> 1765), <span class="occ">dean of Worcester</span>, who was baptized on 19 February 1701 at St Bride's, London. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 26 February 1722, and graduated BA in 1724 and MA in 1727, proceeding DCL on 8 February 1735. In 1727 he was appointed by his father to the posts of vicar of Stanwix, rector of Caldbeck, prebendary of Carlisle Cathedral, and chancellor of the diocese of Carlisle. On 20 August 1728, at St Mary, Carlisle, the younger John Waugh married Isabella (<i>d</i>. in or after 1765), second daughter of Thomas Tullie, dean of Carlisle. They had a son, John (1730&#150;1777), and six daughters.<br>
<br>Bishop Waugh died on 29 October 1734 at his home in Queen's Square, Westminster, and was buried beneath the altar at St Peter Cornhill on 3 November. His son, John, was sole executor and residual legatee of his will; a daughter, Humfrida, wife of Thomas Machen Fiddes, vicar of Barking, also survived him. The younger John Waugh remained in the offices his father had given him under bishops George Fleming and Richard Osbaldeston, and he was said to be &#145;the chief moving spirit of the diocese&#146;  (Wagner, 443), undertaking his own visitations as chancellor and becoming known as an efficient administrator. Waugh established his political reputation by the work he undertook for the government during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Although he was driven out of Carlisle by the Jacobite army, from his temporary base at Barnard Castle, co. Durham, Waugh maintained contact with events in the city and, through contacts along the Jacobites' route to and from Carlisle, was able to gather intelligence which was passed on to the government commanders, Field-Marshal George Wade and the duke of Cumberland. He also organized a corps of local guides to help the army.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the rising Waugh not only supervised the repair of Carlisle Cathedral, but became established as a major political manager for the government in Cumberland. He hoped for preferment on the death of Bishop Fleming in 1747, but although his claim was recognized by Edmund Gibson he was passed over on that occasion. He drafted Bishop Osbaldeston's primary visitation of 1747. In 1751 he was rewarded for his political service with his appointment as dean of Worcester. He promised the duke of Newcastle that &#145;I shall be determined always to serve the Whig Interest there and ever be ready to obey all such Commands as your Grace shall at any Time be pleased to honour me with&#146;  (5 July 1751, BL Add. MS 32718, fol. 270). Although he made regular visits to Worcester subsequently, his main residence was in Carlisle, where he lived in considerable style at Tullie House, Abbey Street.<br>
<br>Dean Waugh died in Worcester on 19 April 1765 and was buried in Carlisle Cathedral on 25 April. Despite his lifestyle he died poor and in his will wrote: &#145;the Provision for the support of my dear wife and our dear children depends greatly on the good will and affectionate tender Love and regard our dear Brother William Tullie Esquire has ever bore to them&#146;  (Wagner, 447). Of Waugh's six daughters one, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1741), had died young, but the remaining five, Judith (1731&#150;1799), Isabella (1735&#150;1809), Elizabeth (1737&#150;1814), Mary (1739&#150;1815), and Margaret (1743&#150;1803), continued to live, unmarried, at Tullie House as the centre of fashion in Carlisle, supported by the wealth of their uncle William Tullie, keeping a coach and four and &#145;what was then unique in Carlisle a footman in livery&#146;  (ibid., 443).<br>
<br>The reputation of Bishop John Waugh has benefited retrospectively from the competence and efficiency of his son, and the social standing of his granddaughters. They added distinction and style to the name Waugh to which the bishop contributed his episcopal rank and the abilities of a dedicated whig churchman whose interests lay with his living and clerical circles in London, and whose life was well advanced by the time he adopted diocesan responsibilities.<br>
