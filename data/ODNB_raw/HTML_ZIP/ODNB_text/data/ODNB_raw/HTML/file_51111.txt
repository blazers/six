<span class="headword">Abrahams,  Israel</span>  (1858&#150;1925), <span class="occ">Jewish scholar and historian</span>, was born on 26 November 1858 at 10 Finsbury Square, London, the second son in the family of four sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59255/', "Barnett Abrahams (1831&#150;1863)")</script> and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brandon (1834&#150;1895). His father was principal of Jews' College, London, from 1858 until his death. Abrahams's two brothers became ministers (Moses at the Leeds Old Hebrew Congregation and Joseph at the Senior Synagogue, Melbourne). He acquired his Hebrew education from his father, and was educated from 1872 at Jews' College and University College, London; he graduated MA in philosophy in 1881. He was a lecturer in English, mathematics, and homiletics at Jews' College from 1881 to 1903, and was a founder and president of its literary society. In 1894 he married Frederica 
    (Freda; 1869&#150;1959)
  , only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37967/', "Simeon Singer")</script>, minister of the New West End Synagogue, London. They had two daughters, one of whom, Phyllis (1900&#150;1973), was a noted Hebrew scholar and librarian.<br>
<br>In 1902 Abrahams succeeded Solomon Shechter as reader in Talmudic and rabbinic literature at the University of Cambridge, and moved to 11 St Barnabas Road, Cambridge. In 1906 he was also made curator of Oriental literature in the university library. He preached regularly in the (Orthodox) synagogue and was outstandingly helpful to his students, encouraging their observance of the Jewish sabbath and invigilating when an examination fell on a sabbath or festival; his home was the centre of university Jewish life. He also lectured regularly at King's College, London. In 1907 he was president of the University of Glasgow theological society, and he was twice president of the society of historical theology at Oxford.<br>
<br>From 1889 to 1908 Abrahams co-edited with Claude Montefiore the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span>, and in it he published a number of important articles, such as one in 1891 critical of the views of Emil Sch&uuml;rer (author of the influential <span class="italic">History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ</span>). With Montefiore he wrote <span class="italic">Aspects of Judaism</span> (1895). In 1896 he published his major work, <span class="italic">Jewish Life in the Middle Ages</span>. In this he presented much new information, including some about the Jews' daily routines and basic beliefs and practices, as well as their relations with other Jewish and non-Jewish communities. He insisted that the Jews did not eschew contacts with Christians except when the political climate made them impossible. The book was arranged not according to countries but into sections that dealt with the home, family relations, personal rites, synagogue and school, business dealings, and relations between Jews and non-Jews. It was frequently re-issued, and updated after his death. His other publications were numerous, including <span class="italic">Chapters on Jewish Literature</span> (1899), <span class="italic">Judaism</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Studies in Pharisaism</span> (1917 and 1924), <span class="italic">Essays on the Future of Palestine</span> (1918), <span class="italic">By-Paths in Hebraic Bookland</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Poetry and Religion</span> (1921), and <span class="italic">Jewish Ethical Wills</span> (in which he presented with English translations a vast range of spiritual wills over the ages), published posthumously in 1926. His books on Jewish history and Jewish life were accepted as standard works. Devoted to the Hebrew language, he also co-wrote in 1903 a Hebrew reading book, <span class="italic">Hebrew Lessons</span>. In addition he was a gifted journalist and made many contributions to the press, especially the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, including the &#145;Books and bookmen&#146; column, the (anti-Zionist) <span class="italic">Jewish Guardian</span>, and <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He also contributed to encyclopaedias.<br>
<br>Abrahams was involved with many Jewish and historical societies. In 1891 he was a founder of the Society of Maccabaeans, for Jewish professional men. In 1893 he was a founder of the Jewish Historical Society of England; he also edited its transactions and was its president in 1904. He served from 1893 on the committee of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, set up to organize teacher training, and he was a governor of the Jewish Religious Education Board established in 1894. In 1902 he was a mover in the founding of the Union of Jewish Literary Societies. He was a member of the Anglo-Jewish Association and its council, and president of its Cambridge branch. In 1898 he visited Palestine during Passover, and was interested in the educational work of the association there. The visit gave him a lasting interest in that country. He advocated in 1908 the founding of a university in Jerusalem, but was always opposed to political Zionism. He was also a founder member of the London Society for the Study of Religion. In 1912, at the invitation of Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, he visited the United States, was the first Lewisohn lecturer, and made an extensive lecture tour, giving over a hundred addresses. He also visited America in 1923 and 1924, when he was given honorary doctorates by the Hebrew Union College and the University of Western Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>Abrahams was sympathetic to the views of Lily Montagu in the founding of Liberal Judaism. In 1902 he became a member of the first committee of the Jewish Religious Union, together with his father-in-law (whose <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span> he later edited). He helped to draft the first prayer book and defended the union's legitimacy in a letter to the Orthodox chief rabbi, Herman Adler. Thereafter he remained involved in the Liberal movement and the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, London: he conducted its first service in 1911. He was an elegant and fluent preacher. He was committed to religious pluralism, favouring the individual conscience over collective rabbinic authority. The breadth of his Jewishness is shown by his publishing in 1913 an annotated version of the Orthodox <span class="italic">Authorized Daily Prayer Book</span> originally edited by his father-in-law (and widely known as <span class="italic">Singer's Prayer Book</span>). He was sympathetic (like Claude Montefiore) towards Christianity.<br>
<br>In July 1925 a presentation was made to Abrahams in recognition of his services to students at Cambridge. On 6 October that year he died in Cambridge. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 8 October; memorial services were held at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue on 11 October and, unusually, in the senate house, Cambridge, on 21 October. The library of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue is named after him. He was survived by his wife and daughters.<br>
