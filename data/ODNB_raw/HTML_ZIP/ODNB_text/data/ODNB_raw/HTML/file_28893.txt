<span class="headword">Watts,  Thomas</span>  (1811&#150;1869), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born in London, in the parish of St Luke's, Old Street, Finsbury, on 28 April 1811. He was one of the three children of Joseph Watts (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;<i>c</i>.1835), a bricklayer, originally from Northamptonshire, and his second wife, Sarah Phillips (1773&#150;1857), born in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. Thomas was always close to his brother Joshua (1808&#150;1875) and his sister Ann Elizabeth (1815&#150;1880). His father bought the Peerless Pool baths in the City Road, London, about 1805, and built over part of the grounds. As owner of the baths and of houses in the area, he was in comfortable circumstances. Thomas Watts received his education at Linnington's academy, Fountain Place, City Road, where he distinguished himself by his facility in composing essays and verses.<br>
<br>After leaving school, Watts initially devoted himself to literature. A retentive memory and a natural linguistic aptitude enabled him to learn all the languages of western Europe (including the Celtic ones), as well as the Slavonic languages and Hungarian, and to make some progress with oriental languages. In 1837 he wrote an article on the British Museum  (<span class="italic">Mechanics' Magazine</span>, 26, 454&#150;60), which to some extent anticipated Panizzi's subsequent design for the new reading-room surrounded by bookstacks within the interior quadrangle. After being a frequent user of the reading-room for some years, he was engaged as a volunteer to catalogue a small collection of Russian desiderata, purchased by H. H. Baber, the keeper of printed books, at his recommendation. At the invitation of Panizzi, Baber's successor as keeper, Watts became a temporary assistant on 17 January 1838, and was mainly responsible for the removal of the books from Montagu House to the new museum building, designed by Sir Robert Smirke. On 27 November he became a permanent assistant, and in 1839 he was one of the four assistants who helped Panizzi draft the new rules for the catalogue of printed books. His duties until 1857 were twofold: he was the principal agent in the selection of current foreign literature for the museum, although he also gave attention to the acquisition of older books; and he arranged all newly acquired books on the shelves according to his own system of classification when the books were moved from Montagu House. In 1847 he introduced his &#145;elastic system&#146; of placing books on the shelves, which prevented the interruption of the numerical series when the growth of the collections required the transfer of books within the library. He estimated that between 1838 and 1857 he arranged on the shelves at least 400,000 volumes. &#145;He appeared&#146;, wrote Cowtan, &#145;never to have forgotten a single book that passed through his hands, and always remembered its exact locality in the library&#146;  (Cowtan, 118). With John Winter Jones, he gave great assistance to Panizzi in producing the memorable report of 1845 which showed the inadequacy of the library's stock and the need for an increased grant for purchases, which the Treasury accepted. Of his achievements as a selector of books, especially in the lesser-known European languages, he himself wrote in 1861:<blockquote>In Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Danish, and Swedish, with the exception of perhaps fifty volumes, every book that has been purchased by the museum within the last three-and-twenty years has been purchased at my suggestion &hellip; every future student of the less-known literatures of Europe will find riches where I found poverty. (British Museum, central archives, CE 4/69, 176)</blockquote>In 1855, again in advance of his time, he advocated the printing of the catalogue despite the fact that Panizzi was opposed to such a course of action until the revision of the catalogue in manuscript had been completed. The royal commission on the British Museum of 1847&#150;9 had recommended that Watts's services should be rewarded; as a result his salary was increased in 1851 from &pound;215 to &pound;300 per annum, and he was promoted assistant keeper on 17 April 1856.<br>
<br>When the new reading-room was opened in 1857, Watts was appointed its first superintendent. This led to his relinquishment of his favourite duty of shelving books, but he continued to direct acquisitions: he estimated that between 1851 and 1860 he had ordered 80 thousand Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch, Scandinavian, Slavonic, and Hungarian books and examined 600,000 titles. He had also prepared lists of desiderata in Welsh, Icelandic, and Chinese, as well as a long list of American orders. On 19 August 1866 he succeeded John Winter Jones as keeper of printed books. His short term of office was marked by his determination to unite<blockquote>with the best English library in England or the world the best Russian library out of Russia, the best German out of Germany, the best Spanish out of Spain; and for every language from Italian to Icelandic, from Polish to Portuguese. (British Museum, central archives, CE 4/69, 176)</blockquote>Among other important acquisitions during his tenure of office were large sections of the Mexican libraries collected by Father Fischer (secretary to the emperor Maximilian) and the bookseller Andrade, and the Japanese library of Philipp von Siebold.<br>
<br>Watts was a warm-hearted and occasionally a warm-tempered man. In spite of some brusquerie and angularity he was popular with his colleagues: in 1867 W. B. Rye referred to his &#145;usual ursine amiability of temper&#146;  (Miller, <span class="italic">That Noble Cabinet</span>, 155). His inexpressive face and an ungainly figure were alleviated for contemporaries by the charm of his conversation. Watts wrote little. His <span class="italic">Letter to Antonio Panizzi, Esq.</span> (1839) exposed the fabrication of the alleged first English newspaper, the <span class="italic">English Mercurie</span>. His fine <span class="italic">Sketch of the History of the Welsh Language and Literature</span> was privately reprinted in 1861 from Charles Knight's <span class="italic">English Cyclopaedia</span>, to which he also contributed a very good article upon the British Museum. He also wrote many biographical articles for the same publication, mainly on foreign men of letters, and he was (with his brother Joshua) a leading contributor to the unfinished <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge</span> (1842&#150;4). He frequently contributed articles to a number of periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. A valued member of the Philological Society, in January 1852 he read to the society his paper on Cardinal Joseph Mezzofanti, whom he described as &#145;the greatest linguist the world has ever seen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Philological Society</span>, 5, 1854, 111&#150;25). A subsequent paper &#145;On the recent history of the Hungarian language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Philological Society</span>, 1855, 285&#150;310) won him election to the Hungarian Academy.<br>
<br>In August 1869, while on holiday with his brother and sister, Watts suffered a slight accident at Bridgnorth, Shropshire, which caused phlebitis of the leg; this led to his death from heart disease at his residence in the British Museum on 9 September 1869. He was interred at Highgate cemetery on 15 September. He never married.<br>
