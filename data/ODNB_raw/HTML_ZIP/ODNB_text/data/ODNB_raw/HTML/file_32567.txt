<span class="headword">Corbett, Sir  Julian Stafford</span>  (1854&#150;1922), <span class="occ">naval historian</span>, the second son of Charles Joseph Corbett, architect and property developer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Byrne, was born on 12 November 1854 at Walcot House, Kennington Road, Lambeth, London. He was educated at Marlborough College (1869&#150;73) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1873&#150;6), where he gained a first class in the law tripos in 1876. In 1877 he was called to the bar and practised for five years, although he found the work irksome. In 1882 he abandoned it and, having private means, travelled extensively, visiting among other places India and the United States. In 1886 Corbett found in fiction an outlet for his literary ability: his first novel, <span class="italic">The Fall of Asgard</span> (1886), was quickly followed by <span class="italic">For God and Gold</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">Kophetua the Thirteenth</span> (1889). He was also drawn towards biography, contributing to the <span class="roman">English Men of Action</span> series the life of Monk in 1889, and in the following year that of Drake. In 1894 he reverted to fiction, his next novel being <span class="italic">A Business in Great Waters</span> (1895).<br>
<br>During this period Corbett continued to travel, visiting Norway frequently, and almost invariably spending the winter in Rome. His taste for sport and travel induced him in 1896 to accompany the Dongola expedition to the Sudan as special correspondent of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. His experiences were much less exciting than he had anticipated, but the campaign undoubtedly set him thinking about the conduct of war as a subject for his pen. In 1898 he produced his first serious contribution to historical literature, <span class="italic">Drake and the Tudor Navy</span>. As he had already written two novels on this theme as well as a biography, the choice of subject was natural enough, but his experiences as a war correspondent had sharpened his perceptions. A critical and popular success, the book was notable not only for its comprehensive use of archival material, but for Corbett's understanding of the relationship between national policy and the use of naval power. Although he was to develop a deep knowledge of sailing battle tactics, his insistence on the primacy of national strategy was to be an abiding theme in his work.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Drake and the Tudor Navy</span> opened a new chapter in Corbett's life, but he was still uncertain about his future direction. His researches had brought him into touch with the Navy Records Society, recently founded by Sir John Knox Laughton, who persuaded him to edit a volume connected with Drake, <span class="italic">Papers Relating to the Navy during the Spanish War, 1585&#150;1587</span> (1898). At forty-five Corbett was hesitating whether to resume the role of the novelist or to follow his friends' advice and stand for parliament, when his marriage on 7 February 1899 to Edith Rosa (<i>b</i>. 1870/71), only daughter of George Alexander, cotton manufacturer, of Manchester, made up his mind. At his wife's request, he decided to devote himself to serious historical writing.<br>
<br>The first fruit of this decision was <span class="italic">The Successors of Drake</span> (1900). Two years later (1902) Corbett edited for the Navy Records Society Sir William Slyngsbie's contemporary <span class="italic">Relation of the Voyage to Cadiz, 1596</span>. From 1900 onwards, at first with articles in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, he began to comment on contemporary defence matters, focusing initially on the need to integrate the efforts of both army and navy. He soon became involved in the movement for naval educational reform, which brought him into contact with Lieutenant Herbert Richmond and Admiral Sir John Fisher. In 1902 Corbett became lecturer in history to the Royal Naval War College, just established at Greenwich, and in 1903 was selected to deliver the Ford lectures at Oxford. In 1904 he presented the results of recent research in <span class="italic">England in the Mediterranean, 1603&#150;1714</span>, a comprehensive study of naval strategy. Naval tactics next engaged his attention, and for the centenary of Trafalgar (1905) he prepared for the Navy Records Society <span class="italic">Fighting Instructions, 1530&#150;1816</span>, a collection of documents illustrating the art of handling battle fleets in the days of sail. But at the War College it was strategy rather than tactics that his audiences required, and in 1907 he completed another notable contribution to the subject, <span class="italic">England in the Seven Years' War</span>. Benefiting from Corbett's study of the work of Clausewitz, this was a book which, more than any of its precursors, analysed the complex relationship between naval power and national policy.<br>
<br>During Fisher's term as first sea lord (1904&#150;10), he called on Corbett to support many of his innovations, notably the <i>Dreadnought</i> and the battle cruiser, with historical argument in the public press and in material for government committees. Corbett did much to assist the admiral but he was always careful to limit himself to judgements which could fairly be deduced from historical analysis. In 1908, he edited for the Navy Records Society volumes dealing with <span class="italic">Views of the Battles of the Third Dutch War</span> and <span class="italic">Signals and Instructions, 1776&#150;1794</span>, the latter a supplement to his <span class="italic">Fighting Instructions</span>. He also found time to write numerous articles and pamphlets, including <span class="italic">The Capture of Private Property at Sea</span>, reprinted by A. T. Mahan in <span class="italic">Some Neglected Aspects of War</span> (1907). But Corbett was chiefly engaged upon a new study, <span class="italic">The Campaign of Trafalgar</span>, published in 1910. His most important work so far, it disappointed some reviewers, who were expecting more emphasis on Corbett's controversial treatment of Nelson's tactics. They received instead what may be called the first staff history of a naval campaign. Nevertheless, Corbett's tactical assessments were sufficiently controversial to cause the formation of an Admiralty committee on the subject in 1912. Its findings largely vindicated him.<br>
<br>Corbett's continuing work at the War College and his revision of his associated pamphlet <span class="italic">Strategic Terms and Definitions used in Lectures on Naval History</span> (1906; the &#145;green pamphlet&#146;) caused him to present the essence of his doctrine in <span class="italic">Some Principles of Maritime Strategy</span> (1911). At the same time he was editing for the Navy Records Society the <span class="italic">Private Papers of George, Second Earl Spencer</span> (1913&#150;14), which threw new light on naval administration in Nelson's day. On the appearance of the second volume of this work, he was awarded the Chesney gold medal by the Royal United Service Institution (1914).<br>
<br>When the First World War broke out Corbett offered his services to the Admiralty. In addition to organizing the collection of material for the history of the struggle at sea, he wrote pamphlets to press the allied cause with neutrals and supplied statements of historical parallels for the assistance of the naval staff. He also helped in drafting a number of key staff documents. His work in 1914&#150;15 included advising on both the Dardanelles campaign and what Lord Fisher later termed his &#145;Baltic project&#146;. In 1917 he was knighted.<br>
<br>Shortly before the war Corbett had undertaken to write a two-volume classified history of the naval campaigns of 1904&#150;5; this was completed in 1915 under the title <span class="italic">Maritime Operations in the Russo-Japanese War, 1904&#150;06</span>. This confidential work suffered from its timing and its very limited distribution. It received little or no official attention, despite the significance of much of Corbett's analysis to the First World War at sea. However, the experience that he gained was to prove invaluable in compiling the official history of the current naval war and strengthened the historian's hand when seeking access to materials and dealing with cabinet and Admiralty over the issue of censorship. The friendship of Maurice Hankey, secretary of the cabinet and the committee of imperial defence, proved of critical importance, but Corbett's path was not an easy one. All three volumes of <span class="italic">Naval Operations</span> (1920, 1921, and 1923) which Corbett wrote were marked by delay, debate, and attempts at suppression, particularly the last, which dealt with the battle of Jutland. He was forced to tread carefully, making his assessments implicit and leaving criticism often unstated. Even then the Admiralty disclaimed agreement with Corbett's narrative of Jutland, complaining that the &#145;tendency to minimise the importance of seeking battle&#146; was in conflict with the navy's views. This misinterpretation of Corbett's insistence on a utilitarian approach to command of the sea had been a recurring theme in the previous decade. It had brought him into conflict with Lord Sydenham of Combe immediately after Jutland when the latter blamed Corbett's teachings for the indecisive result.<br>
<br>In 1921 Corbett delivered the Creighton lecture at King's College, London, sketching in outline the subject which he had put aside to chronicle the Russo-Japanese War, and to which he always hoped to return&#151;&#145;Napoleon and the British navy after Trafalgar&#146; published in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, in April 1922. But his plans were frustrated. The strain and bitterness of the controversies over <span class="italic">Naval Operations</span> had taken their toll and Corbett died quite suddenly, of heart disease, at Manor Farm, Stopham, Pulborough, Sussex, on 21 September 1922, only two weeks after delivering the manuscript of the third volume of <span class="italic">Naval Operations</span>. He was survived by his wife and by one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Corbett had a natural bent for history, collected rare books and manuscripts, and wrote in a cultured and arresting style. There was as much of the philosopher in him as the historian. It was fortunate that his career was undetermined when the Royal Naval War College was instituted. Finding in him the instrument it needed, it inspired the series of monographs and histories which won for Corbett a wide measure of esteem and, for the Royal Navy, a more profound understanding of its purpose.<br>
