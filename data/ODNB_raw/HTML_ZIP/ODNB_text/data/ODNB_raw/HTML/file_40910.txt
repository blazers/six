<span class="headword">Westerman,  Percy Francis</span>  (1876&#150;1959), <span class="occ">children's writer and journalist</span>, was born at 41 Kensington Terrace, Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire, on 18 May 1876, the son of William Francis Westerman, a master of arms in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Lavinia Anne Colborne. Educated at Portsmouth grammar school, Westerman was keen to go to sea when he left school at the age of eighteen, but poor eyesight prevented him from being commissioned in the Royal Navy, and he obtained a clerical appointment in Portsmouth Dockyard. He used his leisure time for sailing and travelling, and began to write articles for magazines about his experiences. On 23 April 1900 Westerman married Florence Emily, daughter of John Wager, ship's steward, and a son, John Francis Cyril Westerman, was born in 1901. Westerman continued to combine freelance journalism with his clerical duties, his articles appearing in such periodicals as the <span class="italic">Motor Boat Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Yachting Weekly</span>. As well as proving a useful supplement to his salary, which at the time of his marriage was only &pound;90 a year, Westerman's journalism also provided him with a literary apprenticeship before, almost accidentally, he stumbled into writing more substantially.<br>
<br>According to family legend, Westerman's first book, <span class="italic">A Lad of Grit</span>, published by Blackie in 1908 (but dated 1909), originated in a 6<i>d</i>. bet made by Westerman with his wife that he could write a better boys' story than the &#145;tosh&#146; he was reading to his small son. On his wife's retort that the book was better than he could manage, the bet was made and in due course <span class="italic">A Lad of Grit</span>, a tale of Restoration times, appeared. In 1911 Westerman resigned from his Admiralty appointment to devote himself to full-time writing, and other books followed, not only historical fiction, but tales about sea scouts, and contemporary adventure stories, exploiting the emerging technology of submarines, airships, and the wireless. During the First World War Westerman was for a time employed on coastal duties with the Royal Navy, and he later held a commission in the newly formed Royal Flying Corps, these experiences doubtless helping to provide the background for such books as <span class="italic">Rounding up the Raider: a Naval Story of the Great War</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">Winning his Wings: a Story of the R.A.F.</span> (1919).<br>
<br>After the war Westerman and his family lived on a houseboat on the River Frome at Wareham, Dorset, and he consolidated his reputation as one of the best adventure-story writers of the day. Although previously his works had appeared under various publishers' imprints, from 1927 his books were published exclusively by Blackie, who contracted Westerman to produce three books a year. Most were written in the evenings in a beautiful longhand which was then typed before submission to the publisher. By the 1930s Westerman's reputation was at its peak. Although he had never settled on any particular locale or group of characters, he had built up a considerable following for his thrilling and well-told tales in a variety of styles, and a new series of books about a recurring hero, Standish of the air police, reinforced his earlier success. He was acclaimed as the most popular boys' author in a referendum run by the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, and was the subject of a film made by Path&eacute; Gazette.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Westerman served with the Home Guard in Dorset, and continued writing, <span class="italic">War Cargo</span> (1941), the story of a transatlantic voyage, being a typical example. Books continued to appear after the war, but an accident forced Westerman to leave his houseboat in the late forties, and he and Florence moved to lodgings in Wareham. Poor health eventually slowed down his writing, but he still had books published in each of the last four years of his life. A keen sailor and an enthusiastic supporter of the scouting movement, Westerman became a well-known local personality with his nautical figure and peaked yachting cap. By the time he died at St Leonards Hospital, Dorset, on 22 February 1959, he had written over 170 books, which had been translated in half a dozen European languages with total sales of over 1.5 million copies. His son was also a writer of boys' stories.<br>
<br>Although his tales of the sea retain some <i>aficionados</i>, Westerman's books remain of interest largely for cultural reasons. His historical novels, such as <span class="italic">A Lad of Grit</span>, illustrate the survival of the tradition of G. A. Henty into the twentieth century, and tales such as <span class="italic">The Airship &#145;Golden Hind&#146;</span> (1920) show how the fascination with aspects of the new technology developed from the onset of the First World War. Westerman's fiction, in general, despite such limitations as a rather pedestrian style, with its emphasis on patriotism, discipline, and tenacity, offers a revealing picture of British character and culture as enjoyed by many in the first half of the twentieth century.<br>
