<span class="headword">Moore,  Eva</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Eva Moore  Esmond Jack]</span>  (1868&#150;1955), <span class="occ">actress and suffragist</span>, was born on 9 February 1868 at 67 Preston Street, Brighton, the eighth of ten children of Edward Henry Moore, a chemist, and his wife, Emily Strachan. She was educated in Miss Pringle's school in Brighton and went to Liverpool to study gymnastics and dancing under Madame Michau. She returned to Brighton to teach dancing, and one of her pupils was the young Winston Churchill. Eva was given her first professional role by Tom Thorne at the Vaudeville Theatre in London in a play called <span class="italic">Partners</span>, a comedy drama by Robert Buchanan. Her sisters Jessie and Decima were to join her on the stage. In 1890 Arthur Pinero gave her a part as the countess of Drumdurris in his play <span class="italic">The Cabinet Minister</span> at the Court Theatre. Emboldened by money they had won in a bet at the races, on 19 November 1891 Eva married the Irish actor and playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33027/', "Henry Vernon Esmond (1869&#150;1922)")</script>, son of Richard George Jack, a physician and surgeon. Her husband's real name was Harry Esmond Jack. They had three children: a baby, Lynette, who did not survive, and Jack and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101165/', "Jill Esmond")</script>, who both made careers in the theatre.<br>
<br>Eva Moore was an active suffragist and a founder and vice-president of the Actresses' Franchise League, a non-party grouping of actresses working for votes for women, formed in 1908. She did not go to prison but had the deepest respect for women who did. A familiar figure marching in the suffrage processions in London with contingents of other well-known actresses including Cissy Loftus, May Whitty, and Lena Ashwell, she was called as a witness when Emmeline Pankhurst was on trial. However, she resigned from the Actresses' Franchise League when members took exception to her acting in a sketch written by her husband called <span class="italic">Her Vote</span>, in which the heroine was shown to prefer kisses to votes.<br>
<br>When the First World War broke out the Women's Emergency Corps was formed, with the actress&#150;manager Gertrude Kingston lending the Little Theatre as its premises. Eva Moore played at the Vaudeville Theatre in the evening and worked as a volunteer at the Little Theatre during the day. Members of the Actresses' Franchise League also founded the British Women's Hospital in 1914. In the following year she met the &#145;Women of Pervyse&#146;, Mairi Chisholm and Elsie Knocker. An appeal Eva Moore made at a Birmingham theatre raised 1500 balaclava helmets; another appeal raised thousands of sandbags. In 1918, when the Germans were making their last big offensive, she paid a visit to Belgian trenches to see the dressing station at Pervyse. She was one of a delegation who presented to the queen a cheque for &pound;50,000 raised for the British hospital. Five of the Moore sisters worked for the British war effort at home and abroad and all received decorations for their services. Moore was honoured with the ordre de la Reine Elisabeth. After the war she toured the battlefields of France and Belgium and also visited Germany.<br>
<br>Although many touring companies were disbanded at the beginning of the First World War, Eva Moore and her husband carried on performing. In 1914 she went to New York to play the title role in his play <span class="italic">Eliza Comes to Stay</span>, which was poorly received, and in the following year they visited Ireland. In 1918 Eva Moore played Mrs Culver in Arnold Bennett's play <span class="italic">The Title</span>, at the Royalty Theatre under the direction of J. E. Vedrenne, then stayed on at that theatre to take the part of Mrs Etheridge in W. Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">Caesar's Wife</span> and the title role in <span class="italic">Mumsie</span>. In 1920 she joined the Trans-Canada Company, which took British plays and actors across Canada in a tour of forty-eight towns and cities.<br>
<br>Eva Moore was one of the best-known actresses of her day. Between 1887 and 1923, when her book of reminiscences <span class="italic">Exits and Entrances</span> was published, she acted in approximately ninety plays, thirteen of which were written by her husband. The two appeared together in fourteen plays. Eva Moore had parts in a number of films, including <span class="italic">Flames of Passion</span>, <span class="italic">Of Human Bondage</span>, and <span class="italic">La vie parisienne</span>. She visited Berlin to act in <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span> and went to Hollywood in 1942 before returning to Britain in 1945. Her friends included W. S. Gilbert, Sir Herbert Tree, Sir Henry Irving, Anthony Hope, Clemence Dane, Marie Loftus, and Marie Lloyd. She retired from the theatre in 1945. In the latter part of her life Apple Porch, Henley Road, Bisham, Maidenhead, Berkshire, was her home; she died there of myocardial degeneration on 27 April 1955.<br>
