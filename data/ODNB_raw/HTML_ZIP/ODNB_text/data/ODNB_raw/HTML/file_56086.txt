<span class="headword">Eyre <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Aldersey]</span>,  Anne</span>  (1612/13&#150;1681), <span class="occ">account keeper</span>, was probably the third of seven children of Samuel Aldersey (<i>d</i>. 1633), a London merchant and haberdasher who had traded to Nuremberg, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1628), daughter of Philip van Oyrle of Nuremberg and Antwerp. Samuel Aldersey's association with the Collectors of St Antholin's, an influential puritan group aiming to control appointments to church livings and lectureships, among whose members was Robert Eyre, a prominent Lincoln's Inn bencher, resulted in a meeting between Anne and Eyre's son, Robert Eyre junior (1609/10&#150;1655). They married at St Antholin's, London, on 22 March 1631, when Anne was eighteen years old. Her portion was &pound;1000, a large sum which reflected the two families' wealth.<br>
<br>The newly married couple went to Salisbury, Wiltshire, to reside in the house of Anne's father-in-law, The Cheesecross, a three-storeyed, fourteenth-century, timber-framed building (later 31 Cheesemarket). They attended services in the adjacent parish of St Edmund, led by a puritan rector, Peter Thacher. When in 1637 their own parish of St Thomas objected they and other offenders were summoned to the subdean's court in the cathedral for admonishment.<br>
<br>In August 1638 Robert Eyre senior died and his son, now head of the household, started an accounts book. After six months Anne took over the book and the family's finances. The book survives, a remarkably detailed and interesting statement of the household's expenditure for the years 1638 to 1645. Neatly and conscientiously kept, it provides a possibly unique insight into the lifestyle of an urban family of the middling sort. By this time the household comprised, in addition to Anne and Robert, their four children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9037/', "Samuel Eyre (bap. 1638, d. 1698)")</script>, the future judge (a fifth child having died in 1635), and four servants, including Anne Thacher, daughter of the puritan minister. The family's expenditure declined once the civil war started, despite additional spending on such items as cleaning armour and weapons, mending a musket, purchase of ammunition, and barricading the town. Despite these defensive preparations, when nearby Marlborough was looted in December 1642, the Eyres rented accommodation in the comparative safety of the Isle of Wight, where in July 1643 Anne and two of her children survived a smallpox attack. The Eyres had returned to Salisbury by October 1646, though their income, derived from property rents, was depleted.<br>
<br>A surviving letter from Anne to her son, Samuel, in 1660 tactfully advises him to make enquiries before getting engaged: &#145;when done, not to be undone, and done either happy or unhappy&#146;  (Wilts. &amp; Swindon HC, Eyre&#150;Matcham MSS 1369, box 36); Samuel duly made an advantageous marriage. By 1672 Anne was living in Watling Street, London, with her mentally deranged daughter, Margaret Hassell, but she later moved back to Salisbury. In her will dated 1681 she left Samuel her book of Luther's sermons and &#145;all my surgery and physic books and receipts&#146;; she was evidently living in comfortable circumstances. She was buried at St Thomas's, Salisbury, on 20 October 1681. Industrious and methodical, her life had been dominated by religion and family responsibilities.<br>
