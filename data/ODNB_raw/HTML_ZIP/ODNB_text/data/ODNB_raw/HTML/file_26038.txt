<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sotheby,  William</span>  (1757&#150;1833), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was born in London on 9 November 1757, the eldest son of William Sotheby (<i>d</i>. 1766), colonel of the Coldstream Guards, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1790), daughter of Sir William Sloane, of Stoneham, Hampshire. Sotheby's younger brother Thomas (1759&#150;1831) entered the navy, rose to be an admiral of the white, and was captain of the <i>Marlborough</i> when she was wrecked off the &Icirc;le de Giouat, France  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1831). His father died when Sotheby was eight, and his guardians then became <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30237/', "Charles Yorke (1722&#150;1770)")</script>, lord chancellor, and his maternal uncle, Hans Sloane (1739&#150;1827). Sotheby succeeded to the estate of Sewardstone, on the borders of Epping Forest, Essex, which had been the property of the family since 1673. He was educated at Harrow School, but at the age of seventeen purchased a commission as ensign in the 10th dragoons and went to study at the military academy of Angers. He was subsequently stationed with his regiment at Edinburgh, where he made the acquaintance of the young Walter Scott. On 17 July 1780 he increased his financial resources by marrying Mary (1759&#150;1834), youngest daughter of Ambrose Isted of Ecton, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Anne, sister and coheir of Sir Charles Buck, of Hamby Grange, Lincolnshire. They had five sons, William, Charles, George, Hans, and Frederick, and two daughters, Maria and Harriet Louisa. Sotheby then retired from the army; purchasing Bevis Mount, near Southampton, he began to devote himself to literature, and in particular to a close study of the Latin and Greek classics.<br>
<br>Sotheby's first publication was a volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1790), which comprised an account of a walking tour which he and his brother Thomas had made through north and south Wales in 1788, and a number of sonnets and odes with a heroic epistle to a friend, on physiognomy. The volume was reprinted in 1794, with thirteen engravings by J. Smith.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1791 Sotheby moved to London, and began to divide his time between the City and his property at Sewardstone, where he occupied Fair Mead Lodge. Like previous owners of Sewardstone, he acted as a master keeper of the adjoining Epping forest.<br>
<br>Sotheby soon became a prominent figure in London literary circles. He joined the Dilettante Society in 1792, and in 1794 was elected fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries. He entertained the best-known literary figures of the day, and had a benevolent interest in the struggles of young authors. Scott, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Samuel Rogers, Sir George Beaumont, Mrs Siddons, Joanna Baillie, Maria Edgeworth, Byron, Thomas Moore and Southey were numbered among his guests and intimate associates. Scott, who &#145;ever retained for him a sincere regard&#146;, owed to him on his visits to London &#145;the personal acquaintance of not a few of their most eminent contemporaries in various departments of literature and art&#146;  (Lockhart, 1.452).<br>
<br>Sotheby made extensive corrections to the proofs of <span class="italic">Richard I</span>, a poem by his friend Sir James Bland Burges, published in 1800, and in 1809 joined another friend, Sir George Beaumont, in encouraging Coleridge to bring out a literary periodical, entitled <span class="italic">The Friend</span>. In 1812 Sotheby, with Beaumont and Sir Thomas Barnard, received subscriptions for Coleridge's &#145;Lectures on the drama&#146; at Willis's Rooms.<br>
<br>Sotheby's skill in translation secured for him a wide literary reputation. In 1798, after rapidly acquiring a knowledge of German, he published <span class="italic">Oberon: a Poem</span>, a translation of Christoph Martin Wieland's <span class="italic">Oberon</span>, which had already achieved popularity in Europe. Wieland, to whom Sotheby sent a copy of his translation, expressed great satisfaction. A second edition, with illustrations by Fuseli, appeared in 1805. In 1802 Sotheby adapted it as a masque in five acts of blank verse called <span class="italic">Oberon, or, Huon of Bourdeaux</span>, which he dedicated to George Ellis.<br>
<br>An equally good reception awaited Sotheby's verse translation of Virgil's <span class="italic">Georgics</span>, which appeared in 1800 with further editions in 1815 and 1830. Jeffrey, in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, declared it possibly &#145;the most perfect translation of a classic poet now extant in our language&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span> 4, 1804, 303). John Wilson (Christopher North) thought it &#145;stamped&#146; Sotheby &#145;the best translator in Christendom&#146;  (R. S. Mackenzie, ed., <span class="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</span>, 5 vols. (1863&#150;6), 3.456&#150;7). It was reprinted in the sumptuous <span class="italic">Georgica Publii Virgilii Maronis hexaglotta</span> in London, at the translator's expense, in 1827. Besides Sotheby's English version of the <span class="italic">Georgics</span>, it included a Spanish version by John de Guzman; a German version by J. H. Voss; an Italian version by Francesco Soave; and a French version by James Delille. Despite Sotheby's appeals, however, Scott refused to review it.<br>
<br>Although Byron described Sotheby in his <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span> (1809) as one who wrote poetry with sincerity, Sotheby's large poetic output was not well received. His verse includes <span class="italic">The Battle of the Nile</span> (1799), an ode dedicated to Lord Spencer, first lord of the Admiralty, whose second son was involved in the battle; <span class="italic">A poetical epistle to Sir George Beaumont, bart., on the encouragement of the British school of painting</span> (1801); <span class="italic">Saul</span> (1807), a blank-verse epic written in two parts; and <span class="italic">Constance de Castille</span> (1810), a poem in ten cantos in imitation of Scott's <span class="italic">Lady of the Lake</span>.<br>
<br>Sotheby's attempts at writing tragedy also met with little success. His tragedy <span class="italic">Bertram and Matilda</span> was acted privately at Winchester by himself and his friends some time before 1790. He subsequently published at least six other historical tragedies, all in five acts and in blank verse. Only one of these plays appeared on the stage. <span class="italic">Julian and Agnes, or, The Monks of the Great St Bernard</span>, was acted on 25 April 1800 at Drury Lane, with Sarah Siddons and John Philip Kemble in the leading roles. At a memorable point in the play Sarah Siddons accidentally struck the head of a dummy infant she was carrying against a doorpost, and both the audience and the actress herself were convulsed with laughter. There was no second performance.<br>
<br>Sotheby's other tragedies were offered to Drury Lane, but were rejected by the actors. In 1816 Byron persuaded the management to accept <span class="italic">Ivan</span>, but after three or four rehearsals it was withdrawn, as Kean felt unable to make anything of the title-role  (Genest, <span class="italic">Eng. stage</span>, 10.233). Sotheby at once republished the piece as <span class="italic">Ivan, a Tragedy &hellip;, Altered and Adapted for Representation</span> (1816). Byron insisted at the time, in a letter to Samuel Rogers, that Sotheby had been &#145;capriciously and evilly entreated&#146;  (Clayden, 1.239), but afterwards regretted having befriended Sotheby's &#145;trash&#146;  (Clayden, 1.255). With the exception of Byron, Sotheby retained his many literary friendships throughout his life. In 1818 Byron wrote scathingly of Sotheby's &#145;airs of patronage which [he] affects with young writers, and affected both to me and of me many a good year&#146;  (Clayden, 1.255). Others were more tolerant, however. Coleridge spoke on Homer at one of Sotheby's dinner parties in 1828, and Sotheby visited Scott at Abbotsford as late as autumn 1829.<br>
<br>Sotheby, who had been greatly distressed by the death of his eldest son, William, colonel in the guards, on 1 August 1815, went on a long tour of Italy in May 1816 with his family and two friends, Professor Elmsley and Dr Playfair. They returned via Germany at the end of the following year. Sotheby published his impressions of his journey in <span class="italic">Farewell to Italy, and Occasional Poems</span> (1818), most of which he republished with additions in <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1825), and in <span class="italic">Italy and other Poems</span> (1828). On returning to London, Sotheby mainly devoted himself to a verse translation of Homer. <span class="italic">The First Book of the &#145;Iliad&#146;, a Specimen of a New Version of Homer</span> appeared in 1830, and the whole of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (in heroics) followed in 1831. Christopher North praised the work in five articles in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. The <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> followed in 1834, with a new edition of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, and seventy-five illustrations engraved by Henry Moses from Flaxman's designs. As a translator of Homer, Sotheby, who was much influenced by Pope, was considered by Matthew Arnold to have failed to reproduce Homer's directness of style and diction  (Arnold, 10&#150;11).<br>
<br>Sotheby, wrote Byron, &#145;has imitated everybody, and occasionally surpassed his models.&#146; Although his poems and plays were held in high esteem by his friends, he is chiefly remembered for his translations of Virgil and Wieland, and for his friendships with the distinguished literary figures of his age. Sotheby died at his home in Lower Grosvenor Street, London, on 30 December 1833, and was buried on 6 January 1834 in the family vault in Hackney churchyard, Middlesex. His wife survived him; she died on 14 October 1834. Wordsworth wrote to Rogers of his grief at the death of &#145;the veteran Sotheby&#146;  (Clayden, 2.87).<br>
<br>Of Sotheby's other sons, George (1787&#150;1817) entered the East India Company's service, and was killed at Nagpur during the Third Anglo-Maratha War, on 27 November 1817. Hans, also in the service of the East India Company, died on 27 April 1827; Frederick was a colonel in the Bengal artillery and CB, and died in 1870.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26035"></a><span class="headword">Charles Sotheby</span>  (1782/3&#150;1854)<span class="occ"></span>, William Sotheby's second and eldest surviving son, who succeeded to Sewardstone Manor, entered the Royal Naval Academy in 1795. He was a midshipman at the battle of the Nile in 1798, took part in the operations in Egypt in 1801, and fought against the Turks in 1807. He was appointed to the acting command of the <i>Pilot</i> in March 1809, and confirmed in the rank of commander on 8 January 1810, going on to serve on several vessels. On 15 February 1819 he married the Hon. Jane Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1820), third daughter of William, seventh Lord Belhaven and Stenton. Charles Sotheby was appointed to the <i>Seringapatam</i> in 1824, and was active in suppressing piracy in the Mediterranean. After the death of his first wife, he later married his cousin Mary Anne, daughter of Admiral Thomas Sotheby, and Lady Mary Anne Sotheby, on 18 November 1830. He attained flag rank on 20 March 1848, and died rear-admiral of the red at his home at 38 Lowndes Square on 26 January 1854. Charles's and his first wife's eldest son, Charles William Hamilton Sotheby (1820&#150;1887), high sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1881, succeeded to the Ecton estates in that year on the death of his cousin, Ambrose Isted, and sold Sewardstone in 1884; his half-brother, Major-General Frederick Edward Sotheby, succeeded to Ecton on his death in 1887.<br>
<br>William Sotheby's grandson, Hans William Sotheby (1827&#150;1874), the son of Hans, was a man of erudition, referred to in Jeaffreson's <span class="italic">Recollections</span> as &#145;scholarly, fastidious, chivalric Hans Sotheby&#146;  (1.189). He was a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, from 1851 to 1864, and was a contributor to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> (December 1860 and January 1861), and to the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (July 1875).<br>
