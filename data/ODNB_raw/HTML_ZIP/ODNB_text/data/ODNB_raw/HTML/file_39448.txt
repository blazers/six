<span class="headword">Vickery <span class="st"> [Drysdale]</span>,  Alice</span>  (1844&#150;1929), <span class="occ">physician and campaigner for women's rights</span>, was baptized on 13 October 1844, the fifth child and second daughter of John Vickery (<i>d</i>. in or before 1871), of West Moor Farm, Swimbridge, Devon, and his wife, Frances Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leah (<i>d</i>. 1891). By 1851 the family had moved to Peckham, in London, where John Vickery followed the trade of piano maker and organ builder, leaving Alice Vickery behind at a local school.<br>
<br>By 1861 Alice Vickery had joined her family and was employed as a pupil teacher, probably at the secularist William Ellis endowed school in nearby Peckham Fields, Camberwell. In 1869 she began her quest for medical education at the Ladies' Medical College, a controversial establishment providing superior midwifery training for women. Here she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39446/', "Charles Robert Drysdale (1828/9&#150;1907)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39447/', "Drysdale, George")</script>], who became her companion and co-worker; both objected to the institution of marriage and they were never married. Alice Vickery gained her midwifery certificate in 1873, then registered with the British Pharmaceutical Society, which admitted women to courses and examinations, though not to membership. She is said to have been the first woman to pass the examination, probably after working as a dispenser, enabling her to describe herself as &#145;chemist and druggist&#146;.<br>
<br>Since no British medical schools admitted women, Vickery went to France in 1873 to study medicine at the University of Paris. Her first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32908/', "Charles Vickery Drysdale")</script>, was born in Paris in 1874. Although Vickery became proficient in French and published several translations over the years, she did not take her degree in Paris. The London Medical School for Women (LMSW) was inaugurated in 1874 and Vickery registered immediately, although she did not enter at that time. In 1877 her existing qualifications were refused recognition by the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, the first institution to admit women to medical licensing, and it was only then that she returned to London and entered the LMSW to complete her training.<br>
<br>In 1877 Vickery became involved in the trial of Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant on the grounds of obscenity for publishing Charles Knowlton's contraceptive handbook <span class="italic">The Fruits of Philosophy</span> (1877). Vickery was active in the subsequent formation of the Malthusian League, which accepted Malthus's law of population but believed that its corollary was the desirability of birth control, becoming one of the first vice-presidents and a member of its council. Her Malthusian activities, however, were initially curtailed through the intervention of the council of the LMSW, which was reluctant to be openly associated, via one of its students, with this scandalous body. She therefore withdrew from public association with the league until she had obtained the medical qualification for which she had been striving for so long, finally qualifying as a licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland and licentiate in midwifery in 1880.<br>
<br>Once qualified, Vickery practised as a doctor. Throughout the 1880s she also gave frequent lectures on Malthusianism, advancing birth control as an essential element for the emancipation of women. Her liaison with Drysdale continued, and their second son, George Vickery, was born about 1881 or 1882. However, the couple did not live together until 1895, when they moved to Dulwich and let it be assumed that they were married.<br>
<br>Alice Vickery was deeply involved in a number of enterprises critical of the late Victorian social norm. She was among the first few British women to obtain a medical qualification, though lacking the privileged background of other pioneers&#151;although she must have had Charles Drysdale's financial, as well as moral and professional, support. She was a freethinker and secularist. She was active in the campaign against the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, and was an articulate advocate of the prudential limitation of the family. She appeared on public platforms and engaged in public debate. She lived out in her own life the objections which many contemporary feminists had to the institution of marriage.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Vickery became involved with the Legitimation League which was set up to protest against the legal penalties borne by the illegitimate but developed a far more wide-ranging agenda critical of existing sexual mores and suggesting remedies and alternatives. She condemned the existing legal position of women, and made sweeping suggestions for its improvement. During the same decade she joined the National Society for Women's Suffrage, later moving on to the more militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), and then the Women's Freedom League which seceded from the WSPU in protest at the Pankhurst autocracy. She subscribed generously to the cause and participated in demonstrations but does not seem to have been a major figure in the political struggle, presumably regarding her work for birth control as her most significant contribution to women's emancipation, though it was a subject by no means universally approved of within the suffrage movement.<br>
<br>After Charles Drysdale's death Alice Vickery continued her work, both as a doctor and for the Malthusian League. About 1910 she was asked by Anna Martin, a welfare worker in Rotherhithe, London, to instruct local women in birth control methods, which she did privately and informally. New causes she took up were eugenics (she was an early member of the Eugenics Education Society), divorce law reform, and the international birth control movement.<br>
<br>In 1923 Vickery moved to Brighton to be near her elder son and his wife, and became an active president of the local branch of the Women's Freedom League, addressing a meeting only days before her death, at 13 Victoria Road, from pneumonia, on 12 January 1929.<br>
