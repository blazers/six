<span class="headword">Wild,  James William</span>  (1814&#150;1892), <span class="occ">architect</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29391/', "Charles Wild (1781&#150;1835)")</script>, watercolour painter, and his wife, Margaret, was born on 9 March 1814 in Lincoln, and baptized there in St Peter's, Eastgate. In 1830 he was articled to George Basevi. Already familiar with the Gothic style through his father's work he made rapid progress and at the conclusion of his pupillage was entrusted with the design and erection of a small country church. Independent practice rapidly followed, and Wild was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 29 May 1837, proposed by George Basevi, C. Fowler, and J. B. Papworth; he gave his address as 35 Albemarle Street, London (his parental home). Before 1840 Wild had built six churches, including Holy Trinity, Blackheath Hill (1839; a design was exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1838); Holy Trinity, Coates, Cambridgeshire (1839); St Lawrence, Southampton (1839&#150;42; design exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1839); and a church at Barton, Yorkshire (1840).<br>
<br>In Christ Church, Streatham (1841), Wild designed a church of remarkable originality, often described as being in a Byzantine manner but in fact richly eclectic, combining Early Christian, Italian Romanesque, Islamic, and moorish elements. He relied on simple decoration, with innovatory brick and terracotta polychromy for the exterior details, to secure a distinctive building at the low cost to which his employers restricted him. He was assisted in the internal decoration of the church by Owen Jones, who later became his brother-in-law (by marrying Wild's sister Isabella in 1842).<br>
<br>It was perhaps through his friendship with Jones that Wild became interested in Near Eastern studies and was motivated to join Dr Karl Lepsius's great expedition to Egypt and Nubia, under the patronage of the king of Prussia, from 1842 to 1845. Wild was hired as an architectural draughtsman and a promising orientalist. Lepsius described him as &#145;a young architect, full of genius, [who] seeks with enthusiasm in the East a new field for the exercise of the rich and various gifts with which he is endowed&#146;  (C. R. Lepsius, <span class="italic">Letters from Egypt, Ethiopia and the Peninsula of Sinai</span>, 1853, 35). Among the other members of the expedition was Joseph Bonomi, the second curator of Sir John Soane's Museum. Lepsius and his team drew monuments and inscriptions as far south as Meroe in the Sudan and conducted excavations at Hawara. Wild worked hard on Egyptology during the course of the expedition and contributed a number of letters to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, in one of which he explained for the first time the method by which the Great Pyramid was constructed. On reaching Cairo in October 1842 he was captivated by Cairene domestic building and threw himself into the study of medieval Islamic architecture. He also joined the circle of orientalists around Edward William Lane and thereby gained access to many Islamic residences occupied by Europeans which he studied painstakingly, one of the first Western architects to devote himself to this subject.<br>
<br>After a short hiatus Wild left Lepsius's expedition and returned in April 1844 to Cairo, where he remained for most of the next three years, until the spring of 1847, continuing to explore mosques and Arab houses, living among the people, and making meticulous sketches and drawings. He was also given a number of commissions in Cairo, including a design for a gateway to the British cemetery (1844) for which a design survives in the Public Record Office, Kew. His most important work in Egypt was the Anglican church of St Mark in Alexandria. Wild was appointed as its architect in 1845 but the church was only completed, after changes to the design during construction and long periods of inactivity, in 1855. In its final form the church is eclectic in style, combining an Early Christian plan and English inscriptions with Islamic detailing (decoration derived from architectonic forms, geometrical and flattened foliage ornament) and symbols of faith (the cross and the six-pointed star). By using Islamic detailing Wild not only utilized his studies of Islamic forms but also tried to ensure that the building would be unlikely to give offence in a Muslim city. Mark Crinson has described the building of St Mark's as &#145;an unprecedented event: the first public statement of Anglican presence in the Near East that was also recognised &hellip; as a statement of religious toleration&#146;  (Crinson, &#145;Leading into captivity&#146;).<br>
<br>An obituary of Wild  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 97, 1893, 120&#150;21, signed T. P.) describes how, as a result of his work on St Mark's, Wild was brought into contact with Turkish officials and succeeded in obtaining a firman from the Porte granting an inspection of the great mosque at Damascus in Syria. The obituary recounts that when, after leaving Cairo in 1847, Wild arrived in Damascus and requested the help of the British consul in using this permission<blockquote>the official was horrified at the proposal [as] such a desecration of the sacred building by an infidel would mean death &hellip; if discovered &hellip; Mr. Wild was not to be deterred from making the attempt, and next morning the Consul accompanied him to the door of the mosque leaving him, with much anxiety, to his fate. The Arabic language, native dress and a certain ascetic appearance were &hellip; an ample disguise and he had the gratification of seeing the entire Holy Place without exciting the slightest suspicion, no European ever before having been successful in doing so. (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 120)</blockquote>The same obituary also explained other techniques Wild resorted to in the course of his travels, explaining that<blockquote>drawing in the East involves no inconsiderable amount of inconvenience, not to say danger, from the great suspicion of the natives of the use which may be made of their treasures: here again he had to resort to stratagem, and what could not be done in the daytime had to be accomplished in the night. From time to time in his wanderings he &#145;marked in&#146; the objects he desired to copy, prepared his damped paper for squeezes and in the darkness set forth and obtained impressions with such perfect exactness of details as could not be obtained by drawing under an umbrella without intrusion. (ibid., 120&#150;21)</blockquote>Many of the meticulous drawings made by Wild during his travels are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum (presented by his daughter Elizabeth Wild in 1938). Although Wild's Cairo notebooks were never published, they did become a source for later writers. Owen Jones's celebrated <span class="italic">Grammar of Ornament</span> (1856&#150;7) used Wild's drawings of Cairo for the illustrations of Arabian details.<br>
<br>Wild returned to Britain permanently in 1848, visiting Constantinople, Italy, and Spain <i>en route</i>. He resumed practice and in 1849 won a competition for the design of the St Martin's northern schools in Castle Street, Long Acre, London (dem.), which, after Christ Church, Streatham, were his most important work and an influential example of the secular use of the Gothic. A plain frontage onto a narrow side street allowed Wild to demonstrate how he could achieve a fa&ccedil;ade of great beauty using only the simplest of elements, creating a fine rhythmic composition by means of arcuated treatment of the lower storeys.<br>
<br>In 1851 Wild was appointed decorative architect to the Great Exhibition, working with Owen Jones, who had been appointed one of the superintendents of works, on the interior decoration of the Crystal Palace. Wild's brother Charles Heard Wild was also employed there, checking calculations and testing the structural elements. In the same year, 1851, Wild's health broke down and this eventually compelled him to retire from active practice in 1857. In 1852 he designed the great water tower at Grimsby docks, a red brick structure 230 feet high, inspired by Italian and oriental towers. An obituary of Wild by Reginald Stuart Poole (unsourced copy, Sir John Soane's Museum archive) noted that exactly 1 million bricks had been used in its construction and described it as &#145;the most original and simplest structure of its kind in the United Kingdom&#146;.<br>
<br>From 1853 Wild was retained by the South Kensington Museum as an expert on Arabian art. During this period he designed a Cairene window (now removed) for the oriental courts at the museum, designed by Owen Jones in 1863&#150;5, and also assisted Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Scott in the design of the architectural cast courts (1868&#150;73) and the Huxley Building in Exhibition Road (1867&#150;71). When the iron and glass buildings which had formed the first home of the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) were dismantled and re-erected in east London to form the Bethnal Green Museum (1872), Wild was responsible for the new masonry fa&ccedil;ade, although the forecourt and campanile that he intended were never built. He also designed the British legation buildings at Tehran in Persia (1869) and produced a design for the British consulate at Alexandria (exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1870), which was accepted but never built owing to lack of funds.<br>
<br>In 1878 Wild was appointed curator of Sir John Soane's Museum at 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he carried out many alterations to Soane's interiors. In 1889&#150;90 he constructed the ground-floor Ante-Room and the domed New Picture Room. The intended painted ceiling decoration for the latter remained on paper at the time of Soane's death and was executed, based on the original drawings, only in 1992. Below the Ante-Room and New Picture Room Wild also modified the Catacombs and the West Chamber. Between 1890 and 1892 he inserted glass pavement lights on the ground floor of the museum and widened the small Study, the Dressing Room, and the stairs down to the basement storey. In the same period he made major alterations to Soane's crypt, removing the flat, low stone ceiling and much of the south wall, altering a series of arches, and inserting a large glass window onto the Monument Court, with a deep sill on which he arranged a large group of John Flaxman's models to form the Flaxman Recess. Wild also made proposals to remove Soane's famous dome area skylight and demolish the architectural drawing office to form one large top-lit modern gallery across the rear of the museum: this was a proposal too far for the trustees of the museum. At the time of his death Wild was busy with proposals to put an extra storey onto the main house.<br>
<br>Wild died at the museum on 7 November 1892 and was buried on 11 November at Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Ellen, and two daughters.<br>
