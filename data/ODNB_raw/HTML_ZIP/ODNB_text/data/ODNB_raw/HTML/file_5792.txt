<span class="headword">Cockton,  Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Sherry]</span>  (1807&#150;1853), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in George Yard, Shoreditch, London, on 7 December 1807, one of the eight children of William Cockton, a weaver, and his wife, Mary. Nothing is known of his life before 9 May 1837 when Cockton married Ann, daughter of Abraham and Eleanor Howes, in St James's Church, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Her family owned the Seven Stars inn in Long Brackland in that town. Henry Cockton and his wife rented accommodation at 165 Blackfriars Road, Southwark, London. They had two children, Eleanor and Edward, born in 1839 and 1841 respectively.<br>
<br>Cockton's fame rests on his first novel, <span class="italic">Valentine Vox the Ventriloquist</span>, which he wrote in monthly numbers over 1839 and 1840, under the pseudonym Sherry. This was a comic story about a gifted ventriloquist who used his skills to play practical jokes. A sub-plot describing how Valentine's uncle, Grimwood Goodman, was confined in a private lunatic asylum by unscrupulous relatives was an important literary study of a person unjustly classified insane. Illustrations by Thomas Onwhyn were a feature of this and most of Henry Cockton's later works. <span class="italic">The Age</span> described <span class="italic">Valentine Vox</span> as the best novel of the day and predicted fame for the author. Thomas Prest, a hack writer, produced a plagiarized serial, <span class="italic">Valentine Vaux</span>, under the pseudonym Timothy Portwine. Yet Henry Cockton made little money from <span class="italic">Valentine Vox</span>, and his other works failed to equal his first success.<br>
<br>The popularity of <span class="italic">Valentine Vox</span> prompted Richard Bentley to commission Henry Cockton to write <span class="italic">Stanley Thorn</span>. This story about upper-class society (based on an unpublished novel started by Richard Harris Barham) appeared in <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> between 1840 and 1841. A third serial, <span class="italic">George St George Julian</span>, appeared during 1841 and dealt with frauds and swindles (including Gregor MacGregor's Poyais emigration scheme of 1821). But the publishers went bankrupt, causing Henry Cockton to be declared an insolvent debtor.<br>
<br>Between 1843 and 1845 Cockton wrote three more novels. The second of these, <span class="italic">Sylvester Sound the Somnambulist</span> (1844), the broadly comic story of a sleepwalker, enjoyed some popularity. These works seem to have brought him little financial profit. He then abandoned writing to run the Seven Stars inn at Bury St Edmunds for his wife's family, but was ruined by an unsuccessful malting speculation. This, combined with the debt which he incurred when his brother Edward, for whom he had provided surety, fled to Australia, caused Cockton to resume writing in 1850. He produced a further three novels before dying of consumption at his mother-in-law's house, adjoining the Seven Stars inn, on 26 June 1853. He was buried in the town churchyard in Bury St Edmunds. Tradition held that he died poor and friendless. In 1854 the Royal Literary Fund granted Ann Cockton &pound;25. In 1856 a public appeal was made for his wife and family. Cockton was commemorated in Bury St Edmunds by a memorial erected in the town churchyard in 1884, and a plaque placed on his house in Long Brackland in 1907.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Valentine Vox</span> and <span class="italic">Sylvester Sound</span> remained in print until 1920. (Routledge published 400,000 and 80,000 copies of these, respectively, between 1860 and 1902). Some of his other works were re-issued in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br>
