<span class="headword">Knox,  Archibald</span>  (1864&#150;1933), <span class="occ">designer and watercolour painter</span>, was born on 9 April 1864, the fourth son of the seven children of Robert William Knox, marine engineer, and his wife, Ann, at Cronkborne, Tromode, Braddan, Isle of Man. His parents came from Scotland to the Isle of Man, where his father founded a reasonably successful marine engineering business. He was educated at Douglas grammar school where he was encouraged to take an interest in the Celtic sculptures of the island (then being studied by P. M. C. Kermode) which were much to influence Knox's designs. He trained at Douglas School of Art (1878&#150;84), where he was student teacher until 1888. In 1892 he seems to have been working in the studio of M. H. Baillie Scott, the architect, who was then based in Douglas. In 1897 he left the island to teach in London, which he did off and on until 1912.<br>
<br>It was during this period (perhaps through Baillie Scott) that Knox started working in commercial design. He apparently worked with Christopher Dresser and also with the Silver Studio, where his first works, which were based on Celtic motifs, seem to have been wallpapers for the exclusive Glasgow firm Wylie and Lochhead. The Silver Studio sold five of Knox's textile designs to the London firm of Liberty, and it was thus that he made the contacts which allowed him to embark on his major design work. Based on his long-time interest in Celtic ornament, Knox developed a series of designs for the embellishment of metalwork which became immediately popular. Until 1912, either through the Silver Studio or by direct commission, he was responsible for most of the designs in Liberty's <i>Cymric</i> and <i>Tudric</i> ranges&#151;perhaps as many as 5000 (major collections in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Silver Studio collections, University of Middlesex). Since Liberty insisted on anonymity from its designers Knox's full output is not known. (He also designed carpets and pottery.) Liberty continued to sell his designs until the 1930s. From 1904 he taught at Kingston School of Art, but was forced to resign in 1912 after the examiners complained about the style and product of his teaching. A number of his students resigned with him and founded the Knox Guild of Craft and Design, which continued as a design studio until 1939. He tried to make a new career in the United States, but failed and returned to teaching in the Isle of Man.<br>
<br>Knox's designs take a central place in British art nouveau. His Liberty designs drew not only on his study of British Celtic motifs, but also on his interpretation of the continental versions of this style. The swirling interlace and stylized plant motifs which formed his stock-in-trade became popular again in the late twentieth century and his reputation burgeoned. While he understood the manufacturing process of the pewter and silver objects which he designed, he was always much happier with pen or pencil. Liberty was responsible for putting the designs out to be manufactured with firms such as W. H. Haseler of Birmingham; his work is thus perhaps unjustifiably criticized as lacking the finish of his continental contemporaries, who often worked more closely with the manufacturers. Examples of his designs applied to textiles and metalwork may be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum, London, and in the Manx Museum, Isle of Man.<br>
<br>After his retreat to the Isle of Man, Knox continued to work. Perhaps the most remarkable products of these years were his monumental designs for tombstones (including that of Arthur Lasenby Liberty himself) and war memorials. The war memorial in the village of Onchan, Isle of Man, is particularly worthy of mention, and his biggest funerary monument, that to the novelist Hall Caine in Maughold churchyard, Isle of Man (although finished after his death by Winifred Tuckfield, one of the original members of the Knox guild), is both remarkable and original, being a tall, flat monolith, of fine concrete, with the lettering and figures (which are taken from the novelist's books) cast in low relief. The lettering on these monuments was his own&#151;elaborately Celticized art nouveau. Sometimes, however, his lettering became so exaggerated as to be virtually unreadable&#151;as in his painted manuscript, <span class="italic">The Deer Cry</span> (1916, Manx Museum, Isle of Man). An inspired watercolourist (a major collection is in the Manx Museum), particularly of Manx landscapes and buildings, he was particularly adept in his treatment of stone and whitewashed walls which he tackled with a confidence seen in few twentieth-century artists in this medium, although interestingly he has been compared with Charles Rennie Mackintosh. He rarely signed his paintings as they were done for his own enjoyment.<br>
<br>Knox was a shy and sensitive man, much admired by his students and by the schoolchildren he later taught in Douglas, although he had a terrible temper. Dapper, with a pointed beard, he appears to have made little money, but from time to time had family support. He never married. He died suddenly of heart failure at his home in Athol Street, Douglas, on 22 February 1933 and was buried in Braddan new cemetery, Isle of Man, with a headstone carved in Knox's own style by Thomas Quayle.<br>
