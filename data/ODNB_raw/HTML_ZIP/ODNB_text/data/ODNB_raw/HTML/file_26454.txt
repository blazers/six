<span class="headword">Stewart,  Alexander</span>  (<em>c.</em>1493&#150;1513), <span class="occ">administrator and archbishop-designate of St Andrews</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14590/', "James IV, king of Scots (1473&#150;1513)")</script>, and Marion Boyd. His mother, with whom James IV had a liaison between 1492 and 1494, was the daughter of Archibald Boyd of Naristoun and a niece of Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus. James intended his son for high office in the church: accordingly in 1497 he obtained for Alexander a dispensation from illegitimacy, and subsequently he saw that the boy received an education suitable for a prelate and a prince. In January 1501 Alexander was dispatched to Stirling, where he (along with others of James's illegitimate offspring) was placed in the charge of James Watson, graduate of Louvain and a future dean of the faculty of arts at St Andrews. In early 1503 he made a brief visit to France in the company of John Hervey, then of the University of Paris, and in 1506 he was received at St Andrews into the faculty of arts. James subsequently entrusted his son's education to the classical stylist Patrick Panter, royal secretary from 1505, with whom the youth developed a close and lasting friendship.<br>
<br>Alexander Stewart was appointed archdeacon of St Andrews in or before September 1502. The archbishop of St Andrews&#151;Alexander's uncle James Stewart, duke of Ross&#151;was then below the canonical age for consecration, and consequently the crown was receiving the temporal revenues of the archdiocese and of the monastic headships which Ross also held <i>in commendam</i>. Ross died in January 1504, and partly to maintain the existing financial situation, and partly to avoid the appointment of a primate who might oppose the royal policy of nominating crown servants to consistorial benefices, the king decided to nominate Alexander as archbishop. Accordingly he made rapid representations to Pope Julius II, and Alexander was provided to the archbishopric (to which, like his uncle, he was never consecrated) on 10 May 1504. In 1509 he was additionally granted the commends of Dunfermline Abbey and Coldingham Priory.<br>
<br>In September 1507 Alexander was sent abroad again to continue his education, this time to Italy, under the governorship of Thomas Halkerston, provost of Crichton. He was a pupil of Raphael Regius at Padua until about December 1508, when Erasmus was engaged as his tutor; a month or so later Alexander accompanied his new teacher to Siena and, eventually, Rome. In his <span class="italic">Adagia</span>, written after his pupil's untimely death, Erasmus eulogizes the fifteen-year-old student he knew: tall, graceful, and dignified of bearing, albeit short-sighted; introspective, devout, quiet (Panter, too, refers to Alexander's &#145;profound silence&#146;), modest, level-headed, yet of a lively intellect, hungry to learn, with a rare ability to tackle diverse tasks simultaneously, and with an innate love of music and aptitude for music-making. Erasmus also records Alexander's keen interest in history, and his pride in and devotion to his father.<br>
<br>While still abroad Alexander Stewart had cause to exert his primatial authority. Before his departure he had asked the king to nominate Halkerston for the vacant archdeaconry of Aberdeen; however that appointment was contested at Rome by the bishop, William Elphinstone, whose reforming plans precluded the acceptance of an absentee archdeacon. In March 1508 Alexander wrote to James and to Panter urging them, with rhetorical asperity, to defend the original nomination; however, by October 1508 he was more diplomatically asking James to find an equivalent benefice for Halkerston, preferably within the diocese of St Andrews. In the same year, having learnt of his father's attempt to detach the Chapel Royal from his archiepiscopal jurisdiction, he dispatched a shrewd (though unsuccessful) appeal to the curia which had appointed him&#151;a minor&#151;to his position of responsibility, and which by implication owed him support.<br>
<br>The chancellorship of Scotland had evidently been kept vacant since Ross's death in the expectation that Alexander would succeed to the post after he completed his education abroad. After returning to Scotland in spring 1510 he took custody of the great seal on or before 14 June and was thereafter increasingly involved in the business of government. From late August 1510 onwards he was a regular member of the king's inner council, from March 1511 he began also to sit regularly as a councillor hearing civil causes, and he served as an auditor of the exchequer in August 1510 and July 1512. Meanwhile he also took a considerable interest in the affairs of St Andrews University. In 1512 he undertook a major re-endowment of the pedagogy, and he gave his full support to Prior John Hepburn's foundation of St Leonard's, a college for poor students.<br>
<br>The sources agree that Alexander Stewart was an exceedingly able and well-respected young man, with a distinguished career in church and state ahead of him. This was cut short, however, when on 9 September 1513 he was killed fighting beside his father at Flodden, Northumberland; his place of burial is not recorded. Erasmus lamented the waste of such great promise: &#145;What hadst thou to do with the war-god &hellip; thou who wast consecrated to the Muses, nay, to Christ himself?&#146;  (Herkless and Hannay, 264).<br>
