<span class="headword">Blount, Sir  Christopher</span>  (1555/6&#150;1601), <span class="occ">soldier and conspirator</span>, was the second son of Thomas Blount (<i>b</i>. before 1523, <i>d</i>. 1568) of Kidderminster, Worcestershire. Blount's early life was profoundly shaped by two key influences: devout Catholicism (especially on the part of his mother, Margery, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Poley, who was listed as a confirmed recusant in 1577); and his family's tradition of service to the Dudley family. Blount's paternal grandfather, Edward (<i>d</i>. 1558), had served John Dudley, duke of Northumberland (executed 1553), being a first cousin of the duke's wife. In his turn Blount's father had become comptroller to Northumberland and then a steward to the latter's son, Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. Blount's elder brother, Edward (<i>c</i>.1554&#150;1630), continued the tradition and carried a banderole at Leicester's funeral in 1588. Unlike his brother, however, who inherited substantial land around Kidderminster, Christopher needed to make his fortune through service to Leicester. He became gentleman of the horse to Leicester, who was himself master of the horse to the queen, by October 1584.<br>
<br>Blount's Catholic heritage was reflected in his schooling. As a boy he was tutored by William Allen (later cardinal) at Louvain. He may have been the English student who fell sick there in 1562 and who was tended by Allen until he himself became ill. In 1572 Blount, aged sixteen, and his brother matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford. He did not take a degree but instead went overseas to the Catholic college at Douai (<i>c</i>.1575&#150;1576). At the end of 1576, when the college was forced to leave Douai, Lady Blount sent a servant to bring Christopher home. He and a Mr Throckmorton instead travelled to Paris, where they mixed with supporters of Mary, queen of Scots, including Thomas Morgan.<br>
<br>By October 1577 the English ambassador, Sir Amias Paulet, was sufficiently alarmed by these contacts to warn Blount against Morgan's company and report them to Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham. Morgan later claimed that he cultivated Blount's friendship in the hope that his attachment to Leicester might one day benefit Mary's cause. This opportunity seemed to have arrived in early 1585, when Mary was moved to confinement at Tutbury. Aware of Blount's necessary association with the nearby stud for the queen's horses, Morgan asked Blount to assist Mary by arranging some secret means for her to communicate with her supporters abroad. Blount responded by sending Robert Poley (probably a kinsman) to assure Morgan of his loyalty to Mary and the Catholic cause. In fact Poley had been an agent working against Mary for some time. Blount's success in convincing Morgan to trust Poley must be seen as a calculated endeavour by Blount to profit from his Catholic upbringing by betraying his old friends and associates to Leicester and Walsingham. It is unclear whether his motives were entirely materialistic or partly intended to protect his mother, brother, and other relatives from religious persecution. Blount claimed to Walsingham in 1588 that he himself had forsaken Catholicism. Whatever the motivation Blount and Poley ensured that communications with Mary in 1585 were exposed to her enemies, foreshadowing the process by which other agents would monitor Mary's messages after her removal to Chartley and reveal her complicity in the Babington plot during 1586.<br>
<br>In December 1585, when Leicester led an army to the Netherlands, Blount accompanied his master overseas and became a cavalry officer. At the battle of Zutphen in September 1586 he rescued Sir Francis Vere after the latter's horse had been killed. After serving as lieutenant to Sir Thomas Perrot he assumed the captaincy of Leicester's company of lancers. When the earl handed over command in the Low Countries to Lord Willoughby, Blount remained with the army. In 1588 he was maimed in one hand at Berke. He was later knighted by Willoughby, who described him as &#145;cousin&#146;. In January 1589 he returned home to recuperate from his wound. In April Blount joined the Portugal expedition as a companion of Leicester's stepson, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex.<br>
<br>Blount's participation in this expedition was driven by his sudden marriage to Essex's mother and Leicester's widow, Lettice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Knollys [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8159/', "Dudley, Lettice (1543&#150;1634)")</script>]. News of this sensational match had reached Paris by the beginning of May and the wedding itself probably occurred in March or April. The marriage apparently sprang from the countess's need for male support in her struggle over Leicester's heavily indebted estate, though she and Blount had known each other for some years and proved to be a genuinely happy couple. Fifteen or sixteen years his senior, Lady Leicester brought the tall and black-haired Blount undreamed-of wealth, a tangled web of legal problems, and association with Essex, the queen's new favourite. Blount spent the rest of his life seeking to banish Essex's initial uncertainty about this &#145;unhappy&#146; match  (BL, Lansdowne MS 62, fol. 78<i>r</i>). Described in private letters as the countess's &#145;best friend&#146;, Blount vowed himself to &#145;faythfully honor and &hellip; ever trewlly serve&#146; Essex &#145;tyll after I be dead&#146;  (Warks. CRO, TD 69/6, Blount to Essex, 26 June 1597). Blount soon plunged into property transactions which sought to settle the countess's huge debts with the crown and other legal liabilities. In doing so he sold most of her jewels and &#145;choptte and chainged awaye&#146; her jointure  (BL, Harley MS 304, fol. 88<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Essex's backing ensured that Blount was elected knight of the shire for Staffordshire in the 1593 and 1597 parliaments and that he acted as a virtual deputy lieutenant for the county. Blount served as colonel of a regiment in Essex's expedition to Spain in 1596 and became camp-master for the army after Sir John Wingfield was killed during the storming of Cadiz. Blount and his troops later acted as Essex's vanguard for the attack on Faeroe. In 1597 Blount helped to train the army being prepared for Essex's new expedition, joining the earl's council of war as second-in-command of the infantry under his distant cousin Lord Mountjoy. When the expedition was converted into a voyage to the Azores he joined with Sir Gelly Meyrick and other partisans of Essex to accuse Sir Walter Ralegh of committing a capital offence by his landing at Fayal. Essex ultimately dismissed these charges, but they underlined the growing divide between the earl's friends and opponents. Blount's factional adherence to Essex resulted in his creation as an MA of Oxford on 10 July 1598 in company with several other friends of the earl.<br>
<br>Partisan politics also lay behind the unwelcome suggestion in April or May that Blount should be appointed lord deputy of Ireland but, like several others, he refused the post. Blount was full of misgivings when Essex agreed to become lord lieutenant of Ireland later in the year. Ironically Essex's eagerness to appoint him marshal of the army in Ireland made the reluctant Blount an object of contention between the earl and the queen. Elizabeth agreed to his appointment as marshal in March 1599, but refused to let him join the council of Ireland. Blount accompanied Essex on his campaign in the southern counties, before being badly wounded in the legs in King's county. Essex released him from service in late August, though he was paid as marshal until 30 September. Blount's wound was so severe that he feared for his life and turned again to the Church of Rome, encouraged by two Catholic priests in Dublin. Blount later secretly converted Sir John Davies to Catholicism. Before his return to England, Blount was visited by Essex and the earl of Southampton, who were soon to march north against the Irish leader Tyrone. Essex raised the prospect of returning to England with an army. Blount and Southampton opposed the idea, suggesting instead that he take only a few picked officers as a bodyguard. Essex later returned to England in great haste and was arrested. During 1600 Blount unsuccessfully urged Essex to consider escaping from imprisonment and going into exile abroad.<br>
<br>Blount's influence with the earl now seems to have been overshadowed by that of the more bellicose Southampton, with whom he enjoyed rather strained relations. When he joined Essex and his friends in London in late January 1601 Blount found the two earls already committed to action, but confused in their planning. Called upon to aid his stepson in the forthcoming <i>coup</i>, Blount was more earnest than enthusiastic. According to an abortive plan for seizing the court, Blount would have been entrusted with securing the gate. When Essex and his partisans were panicked into action on Saturday 7 February, Blount was clearly unhappy with the decision to enter the City on foot. As a cavalryman, he preferred the use of horses. Nevertheless he played a vigorous role in Essex's insurrection on 8 February, seizing weapons from a London armourer, laying hands upon a messenger from the queen, and leading the attack at Ludgate, where he repeatedly hacked at the defenders' pikes with his sword before being bludgeoned to the ground by blows to the head.<br>
<br>When Blount fell, Essex's force lost heart and retreated in disorder. Badly wounded, Blount was imprisoned in the nearby house of a London tailor, Richard Newsome. When he was arraigned and condemned at Westminster Hall on 5 March, he had to be carried there on a litter. Although he wrote begging for mercy and reminded the authorities of his service fifteen years earlier, the only mercy Blount received was death by beheading. He was executed on Tower Hill on 18 March 1601, openly professing his Catholicism on the scaffold, and he was probably buried at the Tower on the same day.<br>
