<span class="headword">Hamilton, Sir  (Charles) Denis</span>  (1918&#150;1988), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born on 6 December 1918 in South Shields, co. Durham, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Charles Hamilton, engineer, and his wife, Helena Trafford. He left Middlesbrough high school at seventeen, became a reporter on the local <span class="italic">Evening Gazette</span>, and as a territorial in 1938 got a commission in the Durham light infantry. In 1939 he married Olive (1915&#150;2012), younger daughter of Thomas Hedley Wanless, farmer. They had four sons, of whom one, Nigel, became a writer.<br>
<br>In September 1939 part of the Territorial Army was embodied and Hamilton soon found himself in France. He was one of the few officers in his battalion who got back from Dunkirk. In 1940 he became a captain and in 1942 a major during a spell in Iceland. In 1944 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and commanded the 11th battalion, Durham light infantry, in the Normandy invasion. After the breakthrough in Normandy, Hamilton was posted to the 7th battalion of the duke of Wellington's and led them in an inspired defensive action near Nijmegen, Holland, which won him a place in military history and the DSO (1944). General Montgomery wanted him to remain in the regular army after the end of the war. However, Hamilton went back to provincial journalism and within a few weeks J. G. Berry, first Viscount Kemsley, summoned him to London to be his personal assistant; he held this post until 1950. Now he was at the centre of the Kemsley newspaper empire and was soon exercising influence. The brigadier, as the staff called him (he had ended the war as an acting brigadier), still looked a soldier with his discreet suits, polished shoes, slim, tall figure, and military moustache. If he never failed to find a military analogy to illustrate a newspaper problem, at least he never barked out his commands. He spoke quietly and could be disconcertingly silent when it was his turn to say something. Kemsley made him editorial director in 1950&#151;when he was thirty-one&#151;whereupon he improved the organization and created a training scheme that became the model for a national scheme; he remained in this post until 1967.<br>
<br>Turning his attention to the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, edited by Henry Hodson, Hamilton believed that new readers would be attracted if they were given plenty to read every Sunday&#151;the &#145;big read&#146;. He persuaded his wartime friend Viscount Montgomery to let him serialize extracts from his memoirs, with the result that the circulation was increased by 100,000 copies over fourteen weeks; the new readers stayed. (Montgomery's life was later written by Hamilton's son, Nigel.) In 1959 Kemsley sold his newspaper group to Roy Thomson, a Canadian who had acquired <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> and Scottish commercial television. Two years later Thomson made Hamilton editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and the paper became remarkably successful. Within six years it increased its sales by half a million copies. Hamilton, who did not himself write for the paper, recruited ardent young people and pioneered a bulky Sunday paper in separate sections, which included business news and a colour magazine. His &#145;Insight&#146; team of investigative journalists had outstanding successes. Thomson was a model proprietor, giving editors the widest freedom and in turn Hamilton delegated great responsibility to his assistants.<br>
<br>When Thomson acquired <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1967, he made Hamilton editor-in-chief of both that and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and chief executive of Times Newspapers. Hamilton appointed as editors William Rees-Mogg for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and Harold Evans for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. He behaved very much as a constitutional monarch, guiding, encouraging, and occasionally warning both men. A successful promotion drive for <span class="italic">The Times</span> had to be dropped, for it was too costly to earn the expected profits. Difficulties multiplied in the late 1970s. Both <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> were suffering severe losses because militant Unionists, who resented wage restraint and feared the advent of new technology, were hampering production. Roy Thomson, who had died, was succeeded by his son Kenneth, who wanted to know from his Canadian base what the strengthened hierarchy in London was going to do about the dispute. In the end it was decided, despite the reluctance of Hamilton and another director, to stop the presses, in the hope that this would bring the unions to their senses. It did not and the costly stoppage lasted almost a year (1979). Shortly after publication was resumed, the journalists decided to strike. This was the last straw for Hamilton, who advised Thomson to sell for what he could get. The only bidder who looked likely to preserve the precious heritage and to stand up to the unions was the Australian Rupert Murdoch, who acquired Times Newspapers Ltd in 1980.<br>
<br>Hamilton did not stay long after the take-over, resigning as chairman in 1981, and concentrated on his chairmanship of the expanding Reuters (1979&#150;85). A trustee of the British Museum from 1969, he jointly sponsored the great &#145;Tutankhamun&#146; (1972) and &#145;Treasures of China&#146; (1973) exhibitions. He was an active trustee of the Henry Moore Foundation from 1980 and was president of the International Press Institute (1978&#150;83), the worldwide protector of press freedom. He was president or chairman of many other institutions. Towards the end of his life, he struggled with the help of his son Nigel to produce a slim but valuable book of memoirs, <span class="italic">Editor-in-Chief</span> (1989). Appointed TD in 1975 and knighted in 1976, he had honorary degrees from Southampton (1975), City University (1977), and Newcastle upon Tyne (1979).<br>
<br>Hamilton died of cancer, after a long illness, on 7 April 1988 at his home, 78A Ashley Gardens, Thirleby Road, Victoria, London.<br>
