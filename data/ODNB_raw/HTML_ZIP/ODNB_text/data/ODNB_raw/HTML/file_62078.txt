<span class="headword">Lyon,  Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Edgware Bess]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1722&#150;1726), <span class="occ">prostitute and thief</span>, was born at Edgware, Middlesex, from which her alias was derived. Nothing is known of her parentage or early life, not even whether Lyon was a maiden or married name. She may, however, have been the Elizabeth Miller, alias Lyon, convicted at the Old Bailey and branded in the hand in October 1721 for stealing a piece of silk and 5 yards of cambric from the house of John Davenport, where she lodged, in the parish of St Peter Westcheap, London. Lyon acquired contemporary notoriety as the mistress of the celebrated criminal <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25343/', "John (Jack) Sheppard (1702&#150;1724)")</script>. They met at the Black Lion alehouse in Lewkenor's Lane, St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, in 1722 or 1723, when Sheppard was an apprentice, and it was Lyon who first induced him to steal. She became a confederate in many of his robberies and escapes. On 25 May 1724 they escaped together out of New prison in Clerkenwell, and on 31 August she assisted him to escape from the condemned hold in Newgate.<br>
<br>After Sheppard's execution on 16 November 1724 Lyon exercised a similarly profound influence over other youths. In March 1725 she was committed to the Westminster house of correction, Tothill Fields, for &#145;seducing a shopkeeper's son to go a thieving with her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parker's London News</span>, 31 March 1725). In the following summer she was cohabiting with a young painter named James Little (1708&#150;1725). Lyon is said to have &#145;hurried him headlong to his destruction&#146;  (Guthrie, 4), but he had already turned to crime before their relationship. On 29 August, after robbing Lionel Mills, a button seller, in a field near Montague House, Little was arrested in Lyon's house off Lewkenor's Lane. He was convicted at the Old Bailey in October and executed at Tyburn on 3 November 1725. In March 1726 Lyon was herself indicted at the Old Bailey for robbing the house of Edward Bury, a butcher, in Allen Street, Clerkenwell. The principal witness was her accomplice, John Smith, an employee of Bury. &#145;She persuaded me to rob my master's house&#146;, he told the court, &#145;and said she'd go with me, and put me in the way, for I was a mere ignoramus at such sort of business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1.469).<br>
<br>Lyon was convicted of felony and sentenced to seven years' transportation. She was transported on the <i>Loyal Margaret</i> (Captain John Wheaton) and a landing certificate, dated 1 October 1726, records her safe arrival at Annapolis in Maryland. Her subsequent career is unknown. A 1732 account described her as &#145;a large masculine woman&#146;  (Hayward, 182), but the little we know of her suggests a beguiling as well as a forceful personality. &#145;A more wicked, deceitful and lascivious wretch there is not living in England&#146;, Sheppard allegedly said of her after they had quarrelled  (<span class="italic">Narrative</span>, 14). A woman of loose morals she undoubtedly was, but Lyon sometimes placed herself at personal risk to assist Sheppard to escape from captivity. As a figure in romances such as William Harrison Ainsworth's <span class="italic">Jack Sheppard</span> (1839), the anonymous <span class="italic">Edgeworth Bess, or, Shephard in Danger</span> (1867), and Joseph Hatton's <span class="italic">When Rogues Fall Out</span> (1899), as well as in numerous Sheppard stage plays, Lyon acquired some fame in the Victorian period.<br>
