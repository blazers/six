<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clowes,  William</span>  (1543/4&#150;1604), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born at Kingsbury, Warwickshire, was the son of Thomas Clowes and his wife, Emma Beauchamp. He described himself in 1585 as being then forty-one years old. Of his early life nothing is known, and although for much of his life he practised in London his career did not follow the usual pattern of apprenticeship to a member of the Company of Barbers and Surgeons, followed by examination and a licence to practise within the City and suburbs. He eventually became a member of the company on 8 November 1569, but it was by translation from another, unknown company, and his subsequent relations with the Barbers' Company were far from harmonious.<br>
<br>Clowes is now regarded as one of the most eminent surgeons of his day as well as an outstanding writer on this topic. He wrote, abandoning precedent, in English, and from the many incidental remarks in his works it seems he was at odds with the surgical establishment which he tended to despise. His deepest criticism, and also his strongest invective, was, however, reserved for the ignorance of quack surgeons and the generally deplorable standards of surgical practice of his day. He was in addition, perhaps because of his lack of formal qualifications, highly sensitive to adverse comment, which he thought arose from envy or malice, and by way of defence gave details of his life, achievements, and methods which incidentally provide much insight into the surgical world of his day. Clowes became part of the shift towards Paracelsianism in the writings of surgeons during the period 1570&#150;90. He went on to become &#145;a leading proponent of chemical therapy&#146; and, along with George Baker and John Banister, one of the leaders of the profession who &#145;not only advocated chemical therapy but also projected themselves as allies of the Paracelsian&#146;  (Webster, 327).<br>
<br>Clowes claimed to have studied surgery under a George Keble, also a physician, of whom nothing is known. Clowes praised him highly, and states specifically that he (Clowes) had studied and practised surgery since 1563, asserting that this was &#145;well known to most men&#146;. In that same year, when he was only nineteen, he served as a surgeon in Warwick's expedition to Le Havre, where he met John Banister, acknowledging their long friendship in an introduction to the latter's <span class="italic">An Antidoterie Chyrurgical</span> in 1589. On his return in 1564 and until about 1570 he served as a naval surgeon in Portsmouth, where he acquired a fund of experience and skills which he was able to communicate to his younger colleagues in his subsequent books. Clowes is known to have served on the <i>Aide</i>, which escorted in 1570 the emperor's daughter through the channel on her way to marry Philip II of Spain, and he describes an operation on this voyage to remove a splinter of bone from the lung of the boatswain's mate whose ribs had been fractured. The patient made a full recovery by the tenth day, an impressive achievement on a small vessel at sea.<br>
<br>Clowes was then in his own words &#145;employed in the hospitals in London&#146;, but it was not until March 1576 that he secured a permanent post as one of the surgeons at St Bartholomew's Hospital at a salary of &pound;20 yearly. His previous service and devotion to his patients were acknowledged in his appointment, and a happy relationship lasted until March 1585 when he resigned with the goodwill of the governors to join, for nine months, Leicester's expedition to the Low Countries. From 1576 Clowes also treated sick children at Christ's Hospital as apothecary-surgeon, and although he appears to have maintained a harmonious relationship with both hospitals this was certainly not the case with the Company of Barbers and Surgeons. The company's minutes record continuous friction with the governors and other members, leading on one occasion to a commitment to ward for some misdemeanour and at least two accusations of taking money from patients without a cure, though to be fair to Clowes this was, at that time, a common occurrence. In February 1575 there was a complaint that he had abused the masters &#145;with scoffing words and jests&#146;, but not for the first time he was forgiven on the promise to conduct himself properly in future. These incidents culminated in March 1577 when he fought with George Baker, one of the queen's surgeons, in Moorfields, and the court once again &#145;pardoned this great offence in the hope of amendment&#146;. The dispute must soon have been forgotten as Baker and he remained on friendly terms thereafter. Clowes's behaviour was therefore tolerated, probably because he was too important a man to ignore, but it was not until July 1588 that he was finally taken into the assistance, or governing body of the company, and it is noteworthy that while he rose to middle warden in 1584 he never became master. Clowes was granted a bishop's licence to practise in 1580 at the direct request of the queen.<br>
<br>About 1586 Clowes was appointed surgeon to the fleet and also one of the queen's surgeons, an honour which he claimed occurred solely through the queen's &#145;favour and good-liking&#146;. It was, in his own mind, a vindication against his enemies: &#145;I am not so barren or gross-witted or unlearned in the art&#146;, he said, &#145;as some have termed me to be&#146;. He was appointed by Howard to serve on his flagship the <i>Ark Royal</i> during the Armada campaign, though he left no record of his activities during this period, probably because there were few casualties resulting from engagement with the enemy. The more pressing need in 1588 was for physicians to deal with sickness and disease caused by poor sanitation and bad food. This was a common problem on all sea voyages, and Clowes from his experience was well aware that there was little the naval surgeon could do for such cases as he could by law treat only external injuries and was prohibited from practising internal medicine. He therefore believed naval surgeons should have some knowledge of physic and the right to practise it as they &#145;cannot always have physicians at the elbows to counsel them&#146;. A highly principled man he would use all means, lawful or otherwise, rather than allow his patient to perish through want of help.<br>
<br>As a naval surgeon Clowes encountered the ravages of scurvy which he rightly associated with the seaman's diet and as a preventative, long before Cook's use of lime juice, recommended fresh fruit and vegetables, watercress, or scurvy grass though he could not legally prescribe them. Scurvy was not, however, exclusively a maritime complaint and he noted that it was prevalent among the children at Christ's Hospital where he treated twenty or thirty cases at a time. He recognized also the tendency of gunshot wounds to become gangrenous and advised amputating where possible well above the affected area to avoid the spread of infection. His advice on the technique of amputation, using the tourniquet as tightly as possible as an anaesthetic as well as to minimize the flow of blood, remained standard for many years. So too did his technique for closing wounds. He was always ready to adopt the recommendations of others, and, for example when Guillemeau in 1594 advised tying the arteries to reduce blood loss after amputation, he was the first in this country to adopt the technique.<br>
<br>For the remainder of his professional life Clowes was in practice in London, where, as he pointed out, he encountered the best and most skilful surgeons. He was certainly successful enough to acquire two houses in Fenchurch Street and an estate in West Ham, then becoming a fashionable suburb, to which he later retired, describing himself as a gentleman. He married twice, but in both cases the dates are unknown and little is known of his first wife except that she came from the Godwin family of Kent and had two sons. The first, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5717/', "William Clowes (1582&#150;1648)")</script>, also a surgeon, benefited from the bequest of his father's surgery chest with its pewter boxes, a silver salvatory and plaster box, and his instruments and books. The other son, Richard, was left only &pound;20 in Clowes's will and then only after his daughters had received their legacies on majority or marriage. His second wife, Katherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, had another son by him, Henry, later described as &#145;of Cornhill&#146;, who was admitted to the company in January 1626. There were also two daughters of this marriage, Katherine and Marie. Three other daughters are also mentioned in his will, though it is not clear from which marriage: Margaret, Friswith, and Johanne, who married a William Gregorie. The last was left a clock in Clowes's will, and &pound;3 10<i>s</i>. &#145;which I owe him&#146;.<br>
<br>Clowes died in 1604 at West Ham, reportedly of the plague, and was buried in the parish church. He was survived by his wife. In his lifetime a successful career followed from his energy, practical skill, and great experience, though his aggression towards those who, he believed, envied and wished to discredit him &#145;as though I had spent all the days of my life in the rude woods or wild forests of ignorance&#146; would not have made him a popular figure, except among his patients, and those of his contemporaries he admired. Undoubtedly a difficult man he was driven nevertheless by the highest motives, principally the welfare of his patients and the need to improve the status of the profession by adherence to the best clinical practice based on past experience and teaching. He would not, he said, refuse anything that would benefit his patients from whatever quarter, even infidel, but be thankful for it.<br>
<br>Well read in Latin and French, Clowes was not an innovator but in many ways a conventional figure, who looked back for guidance to Galen &#145;prince of physicians and surgeons&#146;, Hippocrates, Vigo, and de Chauliac, and, in his own day, the Frenchman Ambroise Par&eacute;, whose influence survived until well into the eighteenth century. He should also be remembered as an early advocate of Paracelsianism in England. A further mission was to remove the abuses perpetrated by incompetent surgeons, mountebanks, and quacks who did so much harm and lowered the standing of the profession in the public eye. During Leicester's expedition he believed that there were more killed by the ignorance and incompetence of surgeons than by the enemy, and he was especially enraged by naval surgeons who, once appointed, absconded with their imprest money, given to buy surgical supplies, which could amount to &pound;40.<br>
<br>The first of Clowes's published works was <span class="italic">A short and profitable treatise touching the cure of the disease called morbus gallicus, by unction</span>, first published in 1579. Years of practice at St Bartholomew's and in the navy had led to a thorough acquaintance with syphilis and its treatment; he estimated that 50 per cent of those who entered the hospital suffered from the disease and that he and three colleagues treated a thousand cases a year. His second publication, and the most influential, was <span class="italic">A Proved Practice for All Young Surgeons</span>, published in 1588. Its aim, as its title suggests, was practical guidance for the young practitioner based on what was known, by experience, to be successful, and it included a series of case studies with methods of treatment as well as various compounds and preparations, some of them his own which he generously shared with the reader and some inherited from his master, Keble. Both books ran to several editions. Towards the end of his life, in 1602, he published a work on struma, or the king's evil.<br>
<br>Clowes published these works &#145;for the good of the country&#146;, and the tenor of his writing shows him to be immensely patriotic with a strong sense of nationhood and belief in his country's religion and constitution. Perhaps for these reasons he wrote in vigorous and usually colourful English, pointing out that the great writers of the past had always written in their native tongues while those who criticized him for doing so feared only that the art would become &#145;too common, whereby every bad man and lewd woman is become a surgeon&#146;. In other words, Clowes believed that surgery was too exclusive, concealing its mystery in the Latin in which most of the literature was written and which few could read. Clowes's importance perhaps lies in his vigorous attempts to impose higher professional standards and open up the profession to a broader spectrum of the public by the use of plain English. In doing so he no doubt incurred the hostility of which he complained so often.<br>
