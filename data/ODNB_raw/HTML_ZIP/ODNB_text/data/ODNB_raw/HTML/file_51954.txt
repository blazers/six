<span class="headword">Blair, Dame  Emily Mathieson</span>  (1890&#150;1963), <span class="occ">nurse and nursing administrator</span>, was born on 12 January 1890 at Boghead, Lenzie, Kirkintilloch, daughter of Hugh Blair, muslin manufacturer, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Croll. Blair trained as a nurse at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, from 1912 to 1916. In July 1916 she was appointed ward sister at the VAD hospital, Higham, where she worked until February 1917. She was then a sister at the RAF hospital at Halton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, as a member of Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service (Reserves), and in 1918 she was recommended for a permanent commission with the RAF nursing service, the forerunner of Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service (PMRAFNS), formed by royal warrant in 1921. Blair soon showed that her enthusiasm and ability were above average, and that she was tactful in dealing with staff and patients, and in 1923 she was recommended for accelerated promotion.<br>
<br>Blair's first permanent commission was as sister at the Central Hospital, Hampstead, London, and from 1919 to 1922 she was again at the RAF hospital at Halton. Her first tour of duty abroad was to Baghdad Hospital (1922&#150;4). She also worked in Basrah (1926&#150;8), Palestine (1928&#150;30), and Hinaidi, Iraq (1935&#150;7), with intervening spells in Uxbridge, Halton, and Cranwell. After September 1937 she remained in England, working at Halton and Cranwell. She was a senior sister from January 1925, an acting matron from January 1927, and matron from January 1930. On 6 May 1935 she was presented with the king's jubilee medal. In December 1937 she was moved to the Air Ministry, and was appointed as matron-in-chief of the PMRAFNS from January 1938 until her retirement in 1943. On 6 September 1938 she was awarded the Royal Red Cross (first class) by the joint war committee (the wartime union of the British Red Cross Society and the order of St John of Jerusalem). This was given for her exceptional devotion and the competence she had shown while nursing and caring for the sick in RAF hospitals at home and abroad. Blair was mentioned in dispatches on 1 January 1941. She was created a dame of the British empire (military division) on 2 June 1943. She was appointed to the order of St John on 24 February 1944 in the grade of officer sister and given the honorary position of matron-in-chief of the order of St John.<br>
<br>From 1943 to 1947 Blair was matron-in-chief of the joint war committee. When this disbanded she continued as matron-in-chief of the British Red Cross Society from 1947 to 1953. She was awarded the Florence Nightingale medal in 1947 by the international committee of the Red Cross for her great services to nursing. During the war the appointment of all the trained staff in the 250 joint war organizations' hospitals and convalescent homes was her responsibility. She was immensely tactful and able to ensure that in all the hospitals and homes the relationships between the professional nursing staff and the auxiliary nurses from the Red Cross were happy. She also selected many nurses for overseas service. She was on the executive committee of the Red Cross from 1946. When she retired from the British Red Cross Society she was made an honorary life member. A collection was made for her retirement and she was presented with a wireless on 24 November 1953 by Lord Woolton and Lady Limerick, representatives of the British Red Cross Society. She died, unmarried, on 25 December 1963, at 12 Avenue Road, St John's Wood, London, from lung cancer, and her remains were cremated. A memorial service was held on 28 January 1964 at St Clement Danes, London, which was attended by representatives of all the organizations with which she had been associated.<br>
