<span class="headword">Killigrew,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1652&#150;1712), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15534/', "Henry Killigrew (1613&#150;1700)")</script>, clergyman, and his wife, Judith (<i>d</i>. 1683), and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15536/', "James Killigrew (c.1664&#150;1695)")</script>, served as a volunteer before becoming lieutenant of the <i>Cambridge</i> in July 1666. From her he moved to the <i>Sapphire</i>, and in 1669 to the <i>Constant Warwick</i>. In January 1672 he became captain of the <i>Forester</i>, from which he was moved to the <i>Bonadventure</i> (June 1672 to August 1673), and afterwards to the <i>Monck</i>. He fought in the battles of Schooneveld and the Texel in 1673. After the peace he was almost continuously employed in the Mediterranean, where he successively commanded the <i>Swan</i> prize in 1675, the <i>Harwich</i> and the <i>Henrietta</i> in 1675&#150;6, the <i>Bristol</i> and the <i>Royal Oak</i> in 1678, and the <i>Mary</i> in 1679, returning to England in her in June 1679. He commanded the <i>Leopard</i> briefly in 1680 and the <i>Foresight</i> between 1680 and 1682; in 1683&#150;4 he was captain of the <i>Montagu</i> in Lord Dartmouth's expedition to Tangier, and in 1684&#150;5 of the <i>Mordaunt</i> for a voyage to the Gambia. Pepys, serving as Dartmouth's secretary on the Tangier expedition, found Killigrew to be hard-drinking, keen to make as much money as possible from shipping merchants' goods, and owing his great influence with Dartmouth to the fact that he was sleeping with the king's former mistress, the duchess of Cleveland. Even so, Pepys also found &#145;his manner of living the neatest, and most like a gentleman that I ever saw of any man, and his civility to me extraordinary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tangier Papers</span>, 46). In 1686 Killigrew went out to the Mediterranean in the <i>Dragon</i> as commodore of a small squadron to suppress the Sal&eacute; corsairs. A detailed account of this voyage was written by G. Wood, Killigrew's clerk in the <i>Dragon</i>  (BL, Add. MS 19302).<br>
<br>Killigrew returned to England in May 1689, was promoted to vice-admiral of the blue through the influence of Daniel Finch, earl of Nottingham, and during the summer flew his flag in the <i>Kent</i> in the channel. In December he was appointed to command a squadron which sailed for the Mediterranean in the following March to prevent the Toulon fleet sailing to Brest. On 9 May 1690 he was refitting at Cadiz when he learned that Admiral Ch&acirc;teau-Renault was at sea with ten ships of the line. On the 10th Killigrew, having been joined by some of his ships from Gibraltar, was able to pursue with fifteen ships. However, they were foul and sailed badly, allowing Ch&acirc;teau-Renault easily to sail away from them. Killigrew returned to Cadiz before sailing for home, but bad weather still opposed him. He took thirty-five days to reach Plymouth, and when he arrived the battle of Beachy Head had been fought, leaving the French masters of the channel. Although Killigrew's failure to catch Ch&acirc;teau-Renault and alleged dilatoriness in returning home attracted much criticism, and rumours of Jacobitism were already attached to his name, he was appointed one of the joint commanders-in-chief (along with Sir Richard Haddock and Sir John Ashby) to succeed the disgraced earl of Torrington, serving until December 1690 when they were replaced by Edward Russell. Killigrew served under Russell as admiral of the blue in 1691, but their relationship was increasingly strained, and Killigrew had no command in 1692. When Russell's fleet won its great victories at Barfleur and La Hogue, he complained that:<blockquote>a blessing of so large a spread should import evil to no one of the winning side but to me alone. I see myself rendered by it not only useless at present but perhaps for my whole life &hellip; I see my adversary raised to a capacity to insult over me and to cross all my pretences, whose malice will let no opportunity slip by which it can express itself. (Killigrew to Nottingham, 28 May 1692, <span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 4.192)</blockquote>Killigrew declined the command of the winter squadron in the Mediterranean, regarding it as inferior to the posts he had held, but in 1693 he was again one of the joint admirals, with Sir Cloudesley Shovell and Sir Ralph Delaval, and was appointed a lord commissioner of the Admiralty on 15 April 1693. After the disaster which befell the Smyrna fleet in June 1693 Killigrew, together with Delaval, was dismissed from command and had to face a hostile inquiry by parliament from November to January. Although the admirals were censured for mismanagement, a charge of high breach of trust was defeated by ten votes. Nevertheless, Killigrew lost his colonelcy of the 2nd marine regiment and governorship of Landguard Fort, and was removed from the Admiralty by a warrant dated 24 April 1694. Killigrew and Delaval were widely suspected of Jacobite sympathies and of planning to keep the fleet out of the way to allow James II to invade; indeed, the earl of Ailesbury had held negotiations to this effect with Killigrew early in 1693. Killigrew never commanded again, and spent his later years unsuccessfully attempting to get full and half pay backdated to 1693, although in 1702 he was granted a pension of &pound;700 per annum. He served as MP for Stockbridge, a seat controlled by his brother-in-law, from 1702 to 1705, and for St Albans from 1705 to 1708. In February 1692 he married Lucy, daughter of Thomas Jervoise, of Herriard, Hampshire, and sister of Thomas Jervoise (1667&#150;1743), MP for Hampshire (1698&#150;1702, 1705&#150;10); the couple had one son and three daughters. Killigrew died at St Julians, his seat near St Albans, on 9 November 1712, and was survived by his wife, whose will was on proved 21 November 1729.<br>
