<span class="headword">Dodgson,  George Haydock</span>  (1811&#150;1880), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and illustrator</span>, was born at 38 Castle Street, Liverpool, on 16 August 1811, the eighth of fifteen children of Pearson Dodgson, a linen draper, and his wife Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Haycock. He received what an obituarist referred to as a &#145;middle class education&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 831), which included attendance at a private school in Church Lane, Liverpool, and drawing lessons from Andrew Hunt, the father of Alfred W. Hunt. From 1826 until 1831 he was apprenticed to the Liverpool surveyor Jonathan Bennison before being employed by the railway engineer George Stevenson who employed him to survey land, make specifications, and calculate the expenses of railway construction for the Board of Trade. George Dodgson was extremely conscientious; the same obituarist recalled that, to complete the plans for the Whitby and Pickering Railway in time, Dodgson and three others did not remove their clothes for two weeks &#145;and kept themselves awake through many nights by eating opium and drinking strong black coffee&#146;  (ibid.). His health suffered and in 1834 he abandoned engineering for art.<br>
<br>After a sketching tour of Wales, Cumberland, and Yorkshire, Dodgson moved to London, living at first in Lambeth (1835&#150;6) and subsequently Gower Street (1837&#150;9). Later, following his marriage on 30 September 1839 to Jane Sims (1819&#150;1908), daughter of George Sims, described as clerk of the Mercers' Company, he settled near Regent's Park, occupying 21 Mornington Place (1839&#150;49), 18 Mornington Road (1849&#150;61), and 1 St Mark's Crescent (1861&#150;1877). Dodgson embarked on his new career immediately. He executed picturesque drawings of many public buildings in and around London&#151;St Paul's, Westminster Abbey, and Greenwich Hospital were among his subjects&#151;and soon found employment making drawings for eminent architects. One of these, <span class="italic">Tribute to the Memory of Sir Christopher Wren</span>, a group of Wren's principal works arranged by C. R. Cockerell, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1838 and afterwards engraved. Plates from drawings by George Dodgson depicted the &#145;highly romantic and beautiful scenery&#146; of north-eastern Yorkshire in the <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Scenery on the Line of the Whitby and Pickering Railway</span>, published in 1836 with text by Henry Belcher  (p. iv). His work was also engraved on steel and wood for the <span class="italic">Cambridge Almanack</span> (1840&#150;47); the <span class="italic">Art Union</span> (1851); the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (1845&#150;62); <span class="italic">The Book of Celebrated Poems</span> (1854); <span class="italic">The Poets of the Nineteenth Century</span>, edited by R. E. Willmott (1857); <span class="italic">Lays of the Holy Land</span>, edited by H. Bonar (1858); and <span class="italic">The Home Affections</span>, edited by C. Mackay (1858). <span class="italic">Summer Time</span> (exh. Society of Painters in Water Colours, 1855) was chromolithographed by George Rowney.<br>
<br>From 1835 onwards Dodgson exhibited watercolour drawings of buildings, landscapes (including garden scenes, <i>f&ecirc;tes-champ&ecirc;tres</i>, and, later, coastal scenes), and some interiors and subject pictures (a few of them literary) at the Society of British Artists (1835&#150;9), the Royal Academy (1838&#150;50), the British Institution (1841), and the Liverpool Academy (and Liverpool Society of Fine Arts), where he showed thirty-five pictures between 1841 and 1861. Most of his exhibited work, however, appeared at the watercolour societies. Forty-eight paintings were shown at the New Society of Painters in Water Colours (1842&#150;7), of which he was elected an associate in 1842 and then a member in 1844. Having resigned from this position in 1847, he was elected an associate (1848) and subsequently a member (1852) of the Society of Painters in Water Colours where he was represented by 353 exhibits (1848&#150;80). In addition, Dodgson contributed to the Royal Manchester Institution (1849&#150;62) and the Royal Hibernian Academy (1852).<br>
<br>George Dodgson's works attracted increasing patronage; his popularity was founded on a repertory of landscapes and coastal scenes, many of which were executed during recurrent visits to favourite locations in Yorkshire (Richmond and Whitby), Cumberland (Cockermouth), Westmorland (the Lake District), south Wales (Gower, Swansea, and the Mumbles), and Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, Knole Park in Kent, and along the Thames. He was very fond of beech trees, a favoured specimen at Knole being known as Dodgson's Beech. In all his travels, he never left Britain. Dodgson was described by a contemporary as one of a small group of &#145;searchers after idealized truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 300). He exaggerated the chiaroscuro in sun and moonlit scenes (and artificially lit interiors), introduced small figures in historical costume, and often appended poetical descriptions&#151;from Walter Scott, Coleridge, and Longfellow, among others&#151;to his titles. Dodgson's atmospheric and at times visionary effects owed much to an unusual technique: he was one of the first watercolour painters to exploit a wet method, dropping spots of colour (including vermilion and emerald green) on very damp paper and then blending them together. This practice may have resulted partly from a nervous condition affecting control of the hands.<br>
<br>George Dodgson died of congestion of the lungs at 28 Clifton Hill, St John's Wood, London&#151;to which address he had recently moved&#151;on 4 June 1880. The following winter the Society of Painters in Water Colours exhibited a loan collection of fifty-two of his works. His remaining pictures were sold at Christies on 25 March 1881. He had three children, Jennie (1841&#150;1899), George Pearson (1842&#150;1928), and Jessie (1854&#150;1911), of whom the two youngest became artists. Examples of his works can be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum in London, as well as provincial public collections, including the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.<br>
