<span class="headword">Bourchier, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1595&#150;1660), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was the second but eldest surviving son of William Bourchier (1559&#150;<i>c</i>.1631) of Beningborough, and his wife, Katherine (<i>c</i>.1565&#150;1623), daughter of Sir Thomas Barrington of Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex. He was descended from a family of Norman extraction, a branch of which had settled in Yorkshire during Elizabeth's reign. His father was certified a lunatic in 1598 and upon the death of his grandfather, Sir Ralph Bourchier, that same year, his wardship was granted to his mother and her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70627/', "Sir Francis Barrington")</script>. Bourchier matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, in December 1608, and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 6 March 1610. He was knighted on 11 November 1619, and about a year later married Anne (<i>d</i>. in or before 1649), daughter of William Rolfe of Hadleigh, Suffolk, with whom he had ten children. By 1625, when he was appointed a JP for all three Yorkshire ridings, his estate was valued at &pound;2200 per annum.<br>
<br>Under the tutelage of his mother and the Barringtons, Bourchier acquired a lifelong commitment to the advancement of godly religion and became closely acquainted with a number of leading puritans, including Sir William Masham, Sir William Strickland, and Henry Darley. His religious convictions may partly explain his refusal to pay the forced loan in 1627, and he gave further offence to the crown in 1633 by pulling down fences in the newly enclosed royal forest of Galtres, near York. His right of access to the forest was not recognized by Strafford or the council of the north, which fined him &pound;1800 and detained him in custody. Deeming him mad like his father, Strafford thought Bourchier had acted &#145;rather out of animosity towards me &hellip; than with the least insolent thought towards his Majesty&#146;  (Radcliffe, 1.249). Bourchier looked to Strafford to help mitigate his punishment (apparently travelling to Ireland to attend him), and had his fine reduced to &pound;1000. Although he petitioned parliament against Strafford in February 1641, he apparently disapproved of his case being used as one of the charges at the lord lieutenant's trial.<br>
<br>Bourchier signed almost every Yorkshire petition of 1642 in support of parliament and godly reformation, and against the king's attempts to raise forces in the north. Early in June, while gathering support for a petition at a meeting of the Yorkshire freeholders on Heworth Moor, he had a violent altercation with the royalist peer Thomas, Viscount Savile. Soon after the outbreak of civil war, Bourchier was imprisoned at York by the royalists. Released by June 1643, he took refuge in Hull, where he was involved in the arrest of the Hothams. During 1645&#150;6 he signed almost all the Yorkshire county committee's letters to parliament pleading that the Scottish army be removed from the region. He was returned to parliament for Ripon in the spring of 1647, probably on the interest of Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, the steward of the borough's manorial courts. He helped to mobilize the Yorkshire parliamentarian forces in 1648, and by late November had emerged as a parliamentary patron of the Independent divine Thomas Brooks. Bourchier retained his seat at Pride's Purge, registering his &#145;dissent&#146; from the vote that the king's latest answer constituted grounds for further negotiation on 20 December. He attended all four sessions of the king's trial, and signed the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. A committed Rumper, he was elected to the third and fifth councils of state, figured prominently in the Rump's punishment of delinquents and exploitation of sequestered property, and in July 1651 obtained a grant of &pound;6000 out of Strafford's estate (although there is no evidence that he received any of it). He was active on the Rump's army committees and was a key figure in the committee for plundered ministers and in settling ministers in sequestered livings.<br>
<br>Bourchier apparently supported the Cromwellian religious settlement, being appointed a trier and ejector in 1654. With the restoration of the Rump in May 1659 he returned to Westminster, where he aligned with those anxious to rein in the Quakers. On 18 June 1660 he surrendered himself to parliament, and early in August he died, asserting to the last his support for the regicide: &#145;I tell you, it was a just act; God and all good men will own it&#146;  (E. Ludlow, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. C. H. Firth, 2 vols., 1894, 2.293). He was buried on 8 August at St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street. His son Barrington Bourchier, having aided the Restoration, obtained a grant of his father's estate.<br>
