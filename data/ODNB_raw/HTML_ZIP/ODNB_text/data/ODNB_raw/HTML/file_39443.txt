<span class="headword">Slater,  Gilbert</span>  (1864&#150;1938), <span class="occ">economist and social reformer</span>, was born at 1 Braidwood Terrace, Plymouth, on 27 August 1864, the son of Daniel Slater MA, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Ellen Augusta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Trevor. He was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1882 and graduated BA in 1885 as twentieth senior optime in the mathematical tripos. For much of the next twenty years he was engaged in political and social activity. He was an early member of the Fabian Society, joining it at Plymouth in 1888, and after the dock strike in the following year helped to organize unskilled workers in Plymouth. He became a committee member of the Gasworkers' Union and stood as an independent labour candidate for the school board. After a spell of schoolteaching in Plymouth he moved in 1893 to London, where he was associated with both Balliol House and Toynbee Hall. He began a long association with adult education by lecturing to university extension students. When he married, on 15 April 1897, Violet Oakeshott of Croydon, the third daughter of the late Joseph Oakeshott, a postmaster of Sunderland, his occupation was given as &#145;General Teacher&#146;. They had three children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51739/', "Eliot Trevor Oakeshott Slater")</script>.<br>
<br>A year before his marriage Woolwich in south London had become the centre of Slater's activities. He had joined the settlement work of Charles H. Grinling. But he soon branched out into a range of political and social activities in the newly formed borough. From 1899 to 1902 he edited <span class="italic">Comradeship</span>, the journal of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society, became a borough councillor (1903&#150;6), and was Woolwich's first Labour mayor in 1906&#150;7. He was chairman, vice-chairman, or secretary of many local committees connected with unemployment, the anti-sweating campaign, and the Labour Representation League. In the mean time he was also a research student at the London School of Economics, obtaining the Hutchison Silver medal in 1901, and was awarded a DSc (Econ) in 1905 for his dissertation, published as <span class="italic">The English Peasantry and the Common Fields</span> (1907).<br>
<br>Slater's social and political activism and his academic background were significant factors in his becoming principal of Ruskin College in 1909. The college had been in turmoil following the dismissal in 1909 of the previous principal, a student strike, and the creation of a separate Central Labour College in intentional opposition to Ruskin College. On his appointment, initially to teach sociology, Ruskin's publicity material gave an outline of his career, emphasizing his work in both the labour movement and education. No member of the small teaching staff up to then had anything like that experience. He was endorsed by the leading lights of the labour movement&#151;George Lansbury, Keir Hardie, Sidney Webb, Will Crooks, Pete Curran, and J. A. Hobson. In 1912 he became a member of Lloyd George's land enquiry committee, and in 1913 he published <span class="italic">The Making of Modern England</span>.<br>
<br>A major feature of the conflict at Ruskin in 1909 was its constitution. The striking students and their allies demanded that working-class education should be under the control of working-class organizations. Ruskin's governing council included Oxford University dons as well as others from outside the labour movement. Slater made his mark rapidly by recommending a change in the college's structure: in future only representatives of working-class organizations could be represented on the governing council. In February 1910 the provisional committee of the Central Labour College immediately seized upon the significance of the change. It noted that the new Ruskin constitution was precisely the answer to the demands of the striking students and the new college. The committee therefore invited Ruskin and the Central Labour College to meet to consider uniting. Other differences between them proved impossible to resolve, and the two colleges went their own, mutually hostile ways.<br>
<br>Under Slater's principalship Ruskin College settled down and flourished. Student numbers expanded and there were more international contacts. But the First World War intervened. The college closed and there was no salary for him. He taught at Toynbee Hall, on one occasion so absorbed that he failed to notice a Zeppelin air raid, nor the departure during it of some members of his class. In 1915 he accepted the newly created chair of Indian economics at Madras University, and held that post until 1921. He participated in the proceedings of the imperial board of agriculture, notably on the sub-committee on the Indian famine of 1918. As professor, he inspired his students &#145;to go beyond their classes and text-books and study the human material ready to their hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 March 1938, 16). His questionnaire was used for these surveys, the results of which were published under his editorship as <span class="italic">Some South Indian Villages</span> (1917). He stayed one more year in Madras as the publicity officer for the state and as a member of the Madras legislative council. He produced leaflets explaining government policy to counter the opinions of the Congress Party.<br>
<br>Although he left India in 1923, Slater maintained his interest in the subcontinent, and later published <span class="italic">Southern India: its Political and Economic Problems</span> (1936). In later life he spent his time lecturing and writing on a variety of subjects, including <span class="italic">Seven Shakespeares</span> (1931). His book <span class="italic">Poverty and the State</span> (1930) was based on lectures for a course arranged by the Church of England Temperance Society in association with the University of London and for Police Court Missionaries. He lectured at the London School of Economics and to Indian Civil Service students at Oxford, where he died at his home, 4 Park Crescent, on 8 March 1938. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>G. D. H. Cole described Slater as &#145;a keen internationalist, and a firm believer in human brotherhood and equality. A man of very simple, even ascetic tastes, and great moral courage&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 March 1938, 16). In the Preface to the posthumously published second edition of his <span class="italic">The Growth of Modern England</span> (1939; first published 1932), Vera Anstey, &#145;a friend and pupil&#146;, quoted his description of himself as an &#145;unrepentant Liberal&#146; and an &#145;active pacifist&#146;  (Anstey, vi&#150;vii). She noted that as well as his activity in numerous social movements in England and India &#145;his writings were characterised by wide social sympathies and interests, which forbade the treatment of economic, or political, or ethical developments as independent specialisms, and necessitated the study of mankind &#147;in the round&#148;&#146;  (ibid., x).<br>
