<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colnaghi family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1785&#150;1911), <span class="occ">art dealers</span>, were established in England by <a name="cosubject_5980"></a><span class="headword">Paul <span class="st"> [Paolo]</span> Colnaghi</span>  (1751&#150;1833)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in the Brianza region near Milan, the younger son of Martino Colnago (<i>d</i>. 1783), a distinguished Milanese lawyer, and his wife, Ippolita Raggi. Having settled his father's encumbered estate, Paul left Italy for France in 1783 and became the Paris agent of Antony Torre to sell English prints from a shop in the Palais Royal in 1784. Antony Torre was the son of Giovanni Battista Torre (<i>d</i>. 1780), who had established himself, first in London in 1753, then in Paris in 1760, as a maker of fireworks and instruments (principally barometers and thermometers) and bookseller. Antony ran a London branch at 14 Market Lane, Pall Mall, from 1767. On his father's death, Antony entered briefly (1780&#150;82) into partnership with an optician, Ciceri of Milan (who had employed Paul Colnaghi on his arrival in Paris), before asking Colnaghi, on Ciceri's recommendation, to open his Paris branch.<br>
<br>Torre and Colnaghi became partners in May 1785, when Colnaghi moved to London (and was naturalized English), and brothers-in-law when Paul married Maria Elizabetha (Elizabeth) Baker, sister to Antony's wife, on 21 March 1787. The Market Lane shop was abandoned in 1786 for grander premises at 132 Pall Mall, and two years later Torre handed the business over to Colnaghi. After a brief partnership with Anthony Molteno, printseller, Colnaghi assumed full control. Thus the firm, which began as instrument makers and booksellers in 1760, only later specializing in printselling, underwent a similar evolution to that of Agnews sixty years later.<br>
<br>Paul Colnaghi must have been an impressive man, erudite, fluent in several languages, and charming; he attracted Benjamin Franklin's notice in Paris and was almost persuaded by him to emigrate to America. Giovanni Battista Torre's shop in the rue St Honor&eacute; had become a meeting place for savants, and for collectors of English mezzotints (known as <i>mani&egrave;re anglaise</i>) by William Woollett, William Sharp, and Sir Robert Strange and coloured stipple-prints by Francesco Bartolozzi (1727&#150;1815), a superb engraver with whom the firm dealt for forty years. The flourishing market for English prints collapsed with the outbreak of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars; but Colnaghi survived by shrewdly publishing such popular colour stipple engravings as <span class="italic">The Cries of London</span>, after Francis Wheatley, in 1792&#150;7, and a portrait of Nelson, after Hoppner, which appeared on the day (7 November 1805) that news came of the battle of Trafalgar. He also supplied the British government with views of besieged towns on the continent, thus providing invaluable information for the attacking allied armies.<br>
<br>In 1799 Paul Colnaghi moved his London premises to 23 Cockspur Street, where he held monthly 3 o'clock levees attended by the aristocracy and landed gentry. From these sprang a series of engraved portraits entitled <span class="roman">Royal and Noble Ladies</span>; Lawrence was paid &pound;700 for permission to engrave his painting of Princess Charlotte (1817; Belgian Royal Collection). Appointed printseller to the prince regent, Colnaghi received further royal warrants from him as George IV, and from William IV; other royal patrons included the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans and the duc d'Aumale.<br>
<br>Paul and Elizabeth Colnaghi had three sons and two daughters: the elder son, <a name="cosubject_5979"></a><span class="headword">Dominic Charles Colnaghi</span>  (1790&#150;1879)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at 132 Pall Mall, London, on 15 July 1790; another son, Martin Henry Lewis Gaetano, followed, and there was a daughter, Caroline (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1786). All three siblings worked in the firm, but Dominic was the most outstanding and joined his father about 1808&#150;10. He travelled to Italy in 1816&#150;17 and collected specimens of armour, thus opening up a new field of connoisseurship. He sold these to Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick (1783&#150;1848) in 1818, and continued to act for this famous antiquarian; much of Sir Richard Wallace's collection (Wallace Collection, London) originally came from Meyrick.<br>
<br>Martin Colnaghi (<i>c</i>.1792&#150;1851) was also active, but showed less judgement and diligence than his brother. In 1821 Paul Colnaghi wished to retire to Italy and settled the business, then worth some &pound;25,000 in stock, on his two sons. Martin quarrelled with his father and brother, and in 1824 sued them in chancery. The suit was settled in April 1825, through the good offices of a family friend, by buying out Martin for &pound;3000. Paul and Dominic Colnaghi then moved to 14 Pall Mall East and began trading as P. and D. Colnaghi &amp; Co., the name by which the firm is still known. Martin remained at Cockspur Street, and the two brothers thereafter ruthlessly bid against each other, to Paul's chagrin. John Constable, with whom the family became intimate, as the correspondence between Dominic and Constable attests, recorded in his journal for 16 June 1824:<blockquote>I hear there is quite a bustle at Colnaghi's. &hellip; They are all brisking up. Martin seems to be clearing the house of the old man &amp; Dominic&#151;but he is not quite liked himself&#151;he is said to make love to all the ladies who look over prints there. (<span class="italic">Constable's Correspondence</span>, 4.154)</blockquote>Constable had reason to be grateful to Paul, who, vouching for the Paris-based dealer John Arrowsmith, enabled Constable to show <span class="italic">The Hay Wain</span> (1821; National Gallery, London) at the Paris Salon in 1824, where it created a sensation and won him a gold medal. Colnaghi's tried, with only moderate success, to sell prints after Constable's work, and acted as his agents for the 1827 Paris Salon exhibition. In November 1829 Paul admitted his daughter, Caroline, into partnership until her son John Anthony Scott (<i>d</i>. 1864) came of age. On 30 September 1807 Caroline had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24894/', "John Scott (1784&#150;1821)")</script>, editor of <span class="italic">The Champion</span>, who had died after a duel defending the &#145;Cockney school&#146; of poetry. A subscription for the widow raised &pound;800, which enabled her to join the firm. After Constable's death in 1837 Dominic Colnaghi helped lead the subscription campaign to purchase <span class="italic">The Cornfield</span> (1826) for the National Gallery.<br>
<br>Dominic Colnaghi married Catherine Pontet (<i>d</i>. 1881) on 15 October 1831, and they had two sons, neither of whom entered the firm, but the elder, Sir Dominic Ellis Colnaghi (1834&#150;1908), became a consular official; posted to Florence in 1865, he served as consul-general for northern Italy from 1881 to 1896, and wrote <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Florentine Painters from the Thirteenth to the Seventeenth Centuries</span>, which was edited by P. G. Konody and Selwyn Brinton and published posthumously in 1928 (reprinted 1986).<br>
<br>Dominic Colnaghi greatly admired the work of R. P. Bonington, and in 1827 commissioned from him a number of Italian scenes with Shakespearian characters. After the artist's death the following year Dominic organized the two-day sale of his work at Sothebys in July 1829, buying thirty-five lots for himself, and later that year issued thirteen lithographs after Bonington's Scottish views. Some insight into Dominic Colnaghi's activities for special clients such as Sir Robert Peel emerges from his correspondence with Peel in November and December 1842, when he informed him about the availability of a Lawrence portrait of Lord Brougham (presumably the one of <i>c</i>.1825 now in the National Portrait Gallery, London) that the owner was willing to sell; and in March 1844 Colnaghi explained that Lawrence painted two versions of a portrait of Antonio Canova, the sculptor. There is also a contract with Henry Graves &amp; Co. for a joint venture of August 1836 for selling an engraving by James Bromley after Sir George Hayter's portrait of Lord John Russell, then home secretary, in an edition of 750 prints, the proceeds to be evenly divided between Graves and Colnaghi. This continued the tradition, begun by Paul Colnaghi, of selling engraved portraits of prominent personalities of the day. Paul Colnaghi died, after a short illness, at his London home in St George's Place, Hanover Square, on 26 August 1833, aged eighty-two. His son Dominic and his daughter, Caroline Scott, took over the business, with her son John Anthony Scott and his cousin Andrew McKay joining as clerks. Dominic, or Old Dom as he became affectionately known, continued with the firm until about 1865, when he retired. He died at his home, 62 Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, on 19 December 1879, and was buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>
<br>In 1858 Colnaghis joined with Agnews in publishing <span class="italic">The Gems of the Art Treasury</span>, two de luxe volumes of photographs by Leonida Caldesi and Montecchi of the exhibition held at Manchester in 1857. The possibilities of this new medium were speedily recognized, and in 1864 Julia Margaret Cameron contracted with Colnaghis for the sale of her photographs; in 1866 she held an exhibition there. Earlier, in 1854, John Anthony Scott had commissioned William Simpson to tour the Crimea to prepare material for an account of the war, illustrated with forty lithographs and published in two folios as <span class="italic">The Seat of the War in the East</span> (1855&#150;6), which earned the firm &pound;12,000. After John Anthony Scott's death in 1864, Andrew McKay became sole proprietor, to be joined by his son William as partner in 1879. After his father's retirement William took over, and introduced E. F. Deprez (retired 1907) and Otto Gutekunst (retired 1939) as partners in 1894; but the direct family link with P. and D. Colnaghi &amp; Co. ended with William McKay's retirement in 1911.<br>
<br>Paul Colnaghi's younger son, Martin, married Fanny Boyce Clarke, and their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_32509"></a><span class="headword">Martin Henry Colnaghi</span>  (1821&#150;1908)&#151;baptized Martino Enrico Luigi Gaetano&#151;was born at 23 Cockspur Street, London, on 16 November 1821. Although he was educated for the army, his father's bankruptcy in August 1843 thwarted this ambition. The elder Martin Colnaghi traded first as Colnaghi &amp; Co. (from 1825), and from 1840 as Colnaghi and Puckle, the business passing to Edward Puckle in 1845. Martin died in Piccadilly in May 1851. Martin Henry struggled to established himself, and for two or three years organized the system of railway advertising afterwards taken over by W. H. Smith.<br>
<br>About 1860 Martin Henry Colnaghi turned to art, and for some years travelled as an expert and buyer for his uncle Dominic's firm (although he was never a partner), then for Henry Graves, and then on his own account. He began to specialize in Dutch and Flemish seventeenth-century art, working from his house in Pimlico. He &#145;discovered&#146; Jan van Goyen, and dealt in many works by Frans Hals, long before these masters became fashionable; among the first important collections he helped to form was that of Albert Levy, dispersed at Christies in March 1876. He took over Flatou's Gallery at 11 Haymarket in 1877, renaming it the Guardi Gallery and remaining there until 1888, when he acquired the galleries of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours at 53 Pall Mall, which he named the Marlborough Gallery. He began buying at auction on a substantial scale from 1875, purchasing Frans van Mieris's <span class="italic">Enamoured Cavalier</span> for 4100 guineas (&pound;4305), and from the Lucy sale a Jan Both classical subject for 4500 guineas (&pound;4725). He negotiated several major private purchases, notably the Raphael altarpiece <span class="italic">Madonna and Child with Saints</span> (Metropolitan Museum, New York) from the Colonna collection, which he bought from the earl of Ashburnham for &pound;17,000 in June 1896. After unsuccessfully offering it to the National Gallery for &pound;40,000, he sold it to C. Sedelmeyer of Paris, who sold it to J. Pierpont Morgan for &pound;80,000.<br>
<br>Martin Henry claimed that his wide connoisseurship&#151;his &#145;eye&#146;&#151;was gained, not from academic study, but by practical experience and careful examination of the works of art themselves. He outlived all his brothers and sisters, and was thrice married: first to Sarah Nash, second to Elizabeth Maxwell Howard (<i>d</i>. 1888), and third, on 17 October 1889, to Amy Mary, daughter of George Smith, the artist; he left no children. He died at the Marlborough Gallery on 27 June 1908, and after a funeral service at St James's, Piccadilly, on 1 July, was buried in the family grave at Highgate.<br>
<br>Martin Henry Colnaghi bequeathed four paintings to the National Gallery: Lorenzo Lotto's <span class="italic">Madonna and Child and Saints</span>, Philips Wouwermans's <span class="italic">The Gypsies</span>, Aert van der Neer's <span class="italic">Dawn</span>, and a small landscape by Thomas Gainsborough, <span class="italic">The Bridge</span> (<i>c</i>.1783). He left the residue of his estate (some &pound;90,532) to his wife, and stipulated that &pound;80,000 should go to the National Gallery, after her death, for the purchase of pictures, these to form the Martin Colnaghi bequest. Colnaghi's picture stock was sold in six groups from 22 October 1908 to 7 January 1909 at Robinson Fisher &amp; Co., realizing some &pound;15,000.<br>
<br>The firm of Colnaghi continued to flourish after the family's direct links with it ended. In 1911 Otto Gutekunst was joined by Gustavus Mayer (and later by his daughter Katharina), after which the firm moved to sumptuous premises, designed by Lanchester and Rickards, at 144&#150;6 New Bond Street, vacating them in 1940, eventually to settle at 14 Old Bond Street. James Byam Shaw, who had joined in 1934, became a director three years later; after the war Byam Shaw, himself an outstanding scholar, established close links with the museum world, especially the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum. While their collections benefited greatly from his expertise, Colnaghis gained pre-eminence as dealers in fine prints and drawings. In January 2002 P. and D. Colnaghi &amp; Co. was acquired by Konrad O. Bernheimer and trades now as Bernheimer and Colnaghi.<br>
