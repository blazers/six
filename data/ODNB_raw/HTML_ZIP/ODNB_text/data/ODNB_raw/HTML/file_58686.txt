<span class="headword">Bernays,  Robert Hamilton</span>  (1902&#150;1945), <span class="occ">politician and diarist</span>, was born in Stanmore, Middlesex, on 6 May 1902, the fourth child and third son of the Revd Prebendary Stewart Frederic Lewis Bernays (1867&#150;1941), rector of Great Stanmore, and his wife, Lillian Stephenson (<i>d</i>. 1935). He was educated at Rossall School, Lancashire, from 1915 to 1920, taught briefly at Solihull, and went up to Worcester College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner in history in 1922, being awarded an <i>aegrotat</i> degree in 1925. A member of the Liberal Club, he was president of the Oxford Union in 1925. Having tried and failed to enter the Sudan political service while at Oxford, he became a journalist and later leader writer with the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>After standing unsuccessfully as Liberal candidate for Rugby in 1929, Bernays had more luck in Bristol North in 1931. There, despite his hurried adoption and advocacy of free trade, he was unopposed by a Conservative and won the seat with a 13,000 majority. Before his election he had collected material as <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> special correspondent in India for his first book, a study of Gandhi, <span class="italic">Naked Fakir</span> (1933), while after entering the Commons he used his status as an MP to advantage by travelling throughout Europe as a highly paid journalist. His second book, <span class="italic">Special Correspondent</span> (1934), consisted largely of an account of the beginnings of the Nazi regime in Germany, which he had visited in 1933.<br>
<br>Politics and journalism did not always combine well, however. Bernays's decision in November 1933 not to follow his party leader, Sir Herbert Samuel, into opposition to the National Government cost him his job at the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. Though something of an impoverished political orphan for the remainder of the 1931&#150;5 parliament, Bernays obviously enjoyed politics and the company of politicians. His sense&#151;however precarious&#151;of being close to the centre of things emerges clearly in the diary he maintained and in his letters to his sister, Lucy, who was living in Brazil. These, in edited form and covering the years 1932 to 1939, were published in 1996. They plot not merely the career of a young and ambitiously earnest politician, but also the tensions and uncertainties of politics in the 1930s. In throwing off his free-trading Liberal Party hat, Bernays had invested heavily in the National Government's survival [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96340', "Liberal Nationals")</script>]. Calculating correctly that the route to promotion lay in joining the Liberal Nationals he did so, and reward, when it came, took the form of his being appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister of health in May 1937. In this way he became one of the band of non-Conservative MPs serving in Chamberlain's administration. But the beneficiary of one form of coalitionism in British politics became the casualty of another. Hard-working though Bernays was, he was dropped as soon as Churchill formed his coalition government in May 1940.<br>
<br>Serving thereafter as deputy commissioner for the southern civil defence region, Bernays made two decisions in April 1942. One was to join the army and take a commission with the Royal Engineers. The other was to marry, on 26 April, Nancy Britton (<i>d</i>. 1984), the daughter of a constituent. The couple had two sons, neither of whom have any memory of their father. At the age of forty-two, while a member of a parliamentary team visiting troops in the Mediterranean, he was killed in an air crash off Brindisi on 25 January 1945.<br>
<br>By 1945 there was not much future for National Liberalism, and had he lived to contest Bristol North in the general election of that year Bernays would doubtless have been defeated. His political career would probably have ended then anyway. Although his life was cut short, he should be remembered as both creature and chronicler of an unusual phase in national politics: the period of National Government. In life his achievements were considerable without being exceptional. As an unattached and amusing young man he featured in the pre-war London scene. In death, however, he left in his diary and letters one of the fullest and most colourful accounts of a distinct political regime. In common with other noted political diarists (Cuthbert Headlam, Harold Nicolson, Henry (Chips) Channon, and, most recently, Alan Clark) he never rose above junior office status. Perhaps that level offers the best vantage point for a diarist.<br>
