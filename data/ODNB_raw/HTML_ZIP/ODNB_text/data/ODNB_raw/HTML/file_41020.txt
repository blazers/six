<span class="headword">Heaton, Sir  (John) Frederick</span>  (1880&#150;1949), <span class="occ">road transport administrator</span>, was born on 18 October 1880 in Bradford, Yorkshire, the son of a warehouseman in the woollen trade, and his wife, Mary Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Speight. He attended Bradford Technical College and studied accountancy, taking eighth place in the examinations of the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors. In 1915 he was appointed accountant in the south London firm of Thomas Tilling. Originally &#145;jobmasters&#146;, with a fleet of horse-drawn omnibuses, Tillings had successfully motorized its services by 1912, when it entered into a pooling agreement with the London General Omnibus Company, which limited its motor bus fleet to 150. As a consequence it moved into provincial operation, and in 1916 began to develop a series of &#145;area agreements&#146; to regulate competition between the Tilling subsidiary businesses and those of the British Electric Traction company (BET).<br>
<br>It was at this point that Heaton became Tillings' company secretary, being elected to the board in 1921. The family was persuaded to leave the management of the business in his hands, and when Richard Tilling, a son of the founder, died in 1929, Heaton succeeded to the chair a year later; thereafter he was effectively in sole command.<br>
<br>Richard Tilling had established the policy of collaboration with BET, and in 1928 a jointly owned holding company, Tilling and British Automobile Traction, was formed, in whose management Heaton was closely involved. This made him a key player in the struggle to prevent the four railway companies from acquiring control of the provincial bus companies. The BET board left him to confront Sir Ralph Wedgwood, general manager of the London and North Eastern, and to reach a settlement which, while giving the railways a share of the bus companies' profits, never gave them more than 49 per cent of the equity.<br>
<br>Under Heaton's direction, Tillings acquired a number of businesses which were not put into joint ownership with BET. He managed the group with attention to detail, in contrast with the hands-off attitude of the BET board to its own subsidiaries. Policy differences built up between them, and in 1942 the joint holding company was wound up and the businesses concerned were transferred to one or other of the parents. The divergence of policy may account for the voluntary sale of the Tilling group to the British Transport Commission in 1948, for &pound;24 million, when BET turned down a comparable settlement.<br>
<br>Having seen the distribution to his shareholders of the greater part of the British Transport Commission 3 per cent stock, in which payment was made, Heaton retired. He had transformed the Tilling family business into one of the two ownership trusts that dominated the bus industry in England and Wales from 1916 to 1948, and left his mark in the management policies of the industry after nationalization.<br>
<br>Heaton served on the Inland Transport War Council from 1941 to 1944, and was unpaid chairman of Short Bros. (Rochester and Bedford), on behalf of the government, from 1942 to 1945. He was knighted in 1942. He had a reputation for ruthlessness, and a somewhat abrupt manner, but those who knew him personally saw a man with a sense of humour, and a range of kindnesses that were never publicized. His management style, centralized and authoritarian, remained evident in the industry up to the later days of the National Bus Company in the 1980s.<br>
<br>Heaton was twice married: in 1908, at St John the Baptist parish church, Kidderminster, to Ethel Irene Roberts, the daughter of a chemist; and in 1927, at Briskley Street parish church, Kent, to Mary Stewart Macleod, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson, a widow. Of his three sons and two daughters, all but one daughter survived him. His main interest outside business, apart from his family, was his farm at Cam Court, Cirencester, Gloucestershire. He died of cancer of the prostate, on 27 April 1949, at his home at The Firs, Croxley Green, Hertfordshire.<br>
