<span class="headword">Cawarden, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1514&#150;1559), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the son of William Cawarden, shearman and fuller of London, and his wife, Elizabeth. Apprenticed in 1528 to Owen Hawkins, mercer of London (a date which suggests he was born <i>c</i>.1514), he later became free of the Mercers' Company. He was probably identical with the Thomas &#145;Hawarden&#146; admitted to Gray's Inn in 1528.<br>
<br>Cawarden probably attracted Henry VIII's favour through Thomas Cromwell. In 1539 or 1540 he became a gentleman of the privy chamber, a post he retained under Edward VI. A committed evangelical, he and his wife, Elizabeth (whom he had married by 1542; her surname is unrecorded), were accused of heresy in March 1543 with the &#145;Windsor martyrs&#146;, but in September they were pardoned. In 1544 Henry appointed him keeper of the tents and master of the revels; in the former capacity Cawarden helped to organize the Boulogne expedition of 1544, to which he brought a retinue of fifty-one horse and 200 foot, and was knighted for his services on 30 September. He was licensed to keep forty liveried retainers in 1545. Between 1538 and 1547 Henry granted him lands in Bedfordshire, Kent, Sussex, Warwickshire, and especially Surrey. He became Anne of Cleves's steward for Blechingley in 1540, acquired the manor itself in 1547, and represented the borough in parliament in 1542, 1545 (probably), and 1547. He became keeper of numerous royal manors, most notably Nonsuch Palace in 1544. In his will Henry left him &pound;200 and lands worth 100 marks per annum.<br>
<br>Protector Somerset made Cawarden a Surrey JP and he was also sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1547/8. He was elected Surrey's senior knight of the shire in a 1548 by-election and was returned again (at the council's recommendation) in March 1553. He served on Surrey commissions for the subsidy (1547&#150;51), dissolution of chantries (1547), musters (1548), and seizure of church goods (1553). Following Somerset's fall the council entrusted Cawarden with the Tower of London garrison. In 1550 he became steward of Hampton Court and was granted the site of the London Blackfriars, to which he removed the revels office from Warwick Inn. He turned the parish church of St Anne's (part of the Blackfriars complex) into a store for tents, having ordered the parishioners to remove the sacrament over the altar before he did so himself. He also enjoyed good relations with the duke of Northumberland, and Princess Elizabeth addressed him in a letter as &#145;loving friend&#146;. With Sir Christopher and William More of Loseley, Cawarden headed a gentry faction in Surrey which was at odds with a rival group led by William, Lord Howard of Effingham. He was a contentious figure in other ways too, arousing hostility over enclosures during the 1549 insurrection, quarrelling with his fellow JP William Sackville, and in 1550 suing Philip Paris for implicating him in the murder of Robert Paris, killed that year at Newbury. Cawarden was an active supporter of Northumberland's unsuccessful scheme to secure the throne for Lady Jane Grey in 1553. He seems to have tried to raise men on Jane's behalf among the royal tenants at Wimbledon, and in his capacity as master of the tents was ordered by the duke of Suffolk on 16 July to provide tents for the garrison appointed to secure the tower for his daughter. Three days later Jane herself sent a warrant directing Cawarden to deliver four tents to her &#145;beloved father and counsellor the Duke of Suffolke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 610). He was also suspected of involvement in Sir Thomas Wyatt's rising at the beginning of 1554. On 25 January Lord Howard arrested him; the following day Bishop Stephen Gardiner questioned Cawarden and then released him to raise forces against the rebels. Acting without Gardiner's knowledge, Howard then rearrested Cawarden on the 27th, detaining him at Reigate until the 30th while the sheriff of Surrey confiscated eighteen wagonloads of his equipment, including sixteen pieces of ordnance. Finally the council placed Cawarden under house arrest at Blackfriars until the rising was suppressed.<br>
<br>Cawarden escaped punishment, was elected a knight of the shire in November, and was restored as a JP in 1555. But in the latter year he had to pay Mary &pound;1000 for an unspecified offence and was cited in king's bench for leaving parliament early. He clearly remained suspect in government eyes, and in March 1556 he was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the Dudley conspiracy. But though his servant John Dethicke was executed, Cawarden himself was not indicted. Nevertheless a year later he was briefly in the Fleet prison, and he lost the keepership of Nonsuch to the twelfth earl of Arundel. No doubt his religious stance was largely responsible for his difficulties. Mary's regime forced him to provide the parishioners of St Anne's with another place of worship&#151;according to Stow he gave them only &#145;a lodging chamber above a staire&#146;, which later fell down  (Stow, 1.341)&#151;but it was unable to win him for Catholicism, for he maintained a secret protestant conventicle in his own house near by.<br>
<br>Elizabeth restored Cawarden's fortunes, appointing him lieutenant of the Tower in 1558. He was again elected knight of the shire for Surrey in 1559 and helped Thomas Browne win a contested election for the county's other seat. He died on 25 August that year at Horsley, probably at John Agmondesham's house, and was buried on 29 August in Blechingley church beneath a prominent monument. His heir was his brother Anthony's son William; his executors were his wife (who was buried beside him after her death on 20 February 1560) and William More. Having kept house &#145;right bounteously&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), with a hundred servants and retainers, he left an estate valued at &pound;1611 14<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., though debts and legacies perhaps consumed it.<br>
<br>As master of the revels (a position he was the first to hold) Cawarden was a significant figure in the development of mid-Tudor court culture. His activities took a variety of forms. In 1551 he was involved in the construction of a substantial banqueting house (possibly modelled on Nonsuch) for the reception of French ambassadors in Hyde Park, being responsible for its interior decoration. But he is more often recorded in the context of court entertainments. He was later described as &#145;skilfull and delightinge in matters of devise&#146;  (Colvin, 1.93), and there is evidence that he played a part in the choice of entertainments, notably a letter which William Baldwin sent him during Mary's reign concerning the latter's play <span class="italic">Love and Lyve</span>, in which, according to its author, Cawarden had expressed an interest three years earlier. But he is more often recorded as an enabler than as a deviser of revels, being called on to provide costumes and other necessary gear, often both elaborate and expensive. It cost nearly &pound;300 to enable the courtier George Ferrers to make his state entry into London as the lord of misrule for the Christmas season of 1551/2.<br>
<br>Cawarden was particularly active in Edward VI's last years, for instance with the five masques he helped stage between 7 January and 12 February 1553 to distract the sickening king&#151;&#145;a Maske of Greek Woorthyes, a Maske of Medyoxes, beinge halfe deathe, halfe man, a Maske of Bagpypes, A Maske of Cattes, a Maske of Tumblers goinge upon theyre handes with theyre feet upward&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 606). But he also provided costumes for a play at Queen Mary's coronation feast, for entertainments later in her reign by Nicholas Udall, and finally for London citizens preparing to greet Elizabeth when she in turn processed through the city on her way to be crowned. Cawarden sometimes had to be pressed to deliver what was needed for such occasions, but no one seems to have doubted his competence, suggesting that in this respect, at least, he earned the dedication of Robert Burrant's translation of Cato's <span class="italic">Preceptes</span>, praising his &#145;politique wisdom&#146;.<br>
