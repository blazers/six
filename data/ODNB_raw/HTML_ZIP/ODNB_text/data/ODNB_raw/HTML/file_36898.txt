<span class="headword">Wilkie, Sir  David Percival Dalbreck</span>  (1882&#150;1938), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Kirriemuir, Forfarshire, Scotland, on 5 November 1882, the younger son of David Wilkie, jute manufacturer, and his wife, Margaret Lawson Mill. Given his background, the reasons he opted for a medical career are unknown but he proceeded from the Edinburgh Academy (secondary school) to the University of Edinburgh, from which he graduated MB in 1904 and MD in 1908. He became FRCS (Edin.) in 1907 and FRCS (Lond.) in 1918. After graduation he held house appointments in Edinburgh at the Royal Infirmary, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, and the Chalmers Hospital; thereafter, as was customary for those of his time who had adequate financial resources, he visited surgical clinics at Bonn, Bern, and Vienna. He was appointed to the surgical staff of Leith Hospital in 1910, and in 1912 he became assistant surgeon to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. In 1911 Wilkie married Charlotte Ann Erskine, eldest daughter of James Middleton MD, of Stow, Midlothian; there were no children.<br>
<br>In Edinburgh, Wilkie joined a formidable surgical organization inspired by Francis Caird, one of the pioneers of abdominal surgery in Scotland and a figure who has lacked recognition in the history of surgery in Edinburgh. Through him Wilkie served, along with others, such as Harold Styles and Sir James Fraser, to create a scientific school of clinical surgery. His researches won him the Victoria jubilee prize of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, in 1918. Wilkie was an instigator of thought about such matters as the cause and development of acute appendicitis and he made other contributions to abdominal surgery, though his views on such controversial matters as diverticulosis and gall bladder disease have not stood the test of time. His hypothesis was that chronic illness with abdominal symptoms could originate from the gall bladder, from duodenal ulcer, from &#145;chronic&#146; appendicitis, or from diverticular disease. This unitary concept did not have any basis in anything other than clinical observation of the often co-presence of two or more of these disorders. However, he may have been observing, and correlating with his clinical observations, data about patients who, though diagnosed differently in later years, were nevertheless suffering from what to them were real abdominal conditions.<br>
<br>As a member of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, Wilkie joined the navy on the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. He served on the hospital ship <i>St Margaret of Scotland</i> (Portland) and thereafter in Salonika and on the western front as a surgeon to a casualty clearing station. He was appointed OBE in 1919.<br>
<br>Because of his association with Harold Styles, Wilkie's place in clinical teaching grew so that when the chair of systematic surgery at Edinburgh became vacant in 1924 (on the suicide of Alexis Thomson) he was the obvious successor. Previously such chairs had been largely devoted to the pursuit of clinical practice that would support status rather than science. However, Wilkie negotiated a different contract because he considered that in the past chairs of surgery did not have a high academic content and (<i>pace</i> Joseph Lister) had been mainly appointments that could be exploited rather than carry a near or total commitment to research and teaching. Wilkie, having travelled widely on the continent and in the USA, saw the need for compromise between practice and science, and he threw himself with characteristic zeal into his role, which had been the subject of fresh negotiation between him and the university. Nevertheless he retained the right of private practice&#151;in the late twentieth century called &#145;maximum part-time&#146;&#151;which he did not need financially but which he felt formed an element of his status as a surgeon. Even late in his surgical career he would think nothing of going to North Berwick (20 miles from Edinburgh) to remove an appendix for a large fee. His gift of lucid expression served him well as a lecturer, while his cheerful, dignified, yet modest presence won the hearts of his students.<br>
<br>Wilkie's particular interest, derived from his experiences in the USA, was in developing surgical research, and he gathered around him a group of young surgeons both from the UK and from the USA (the latter were rare in the 1930s) who were proud to be regarded as &#145;Wilkie's young men&#146;. The surgical research tradition that he fostered was significant in starting a new wave of surgical study in Scotland after the Second World War, under Charles F. W. Illingworth, James Learmonth, William Wilson, and others. Despite Wilkie's other preoccupations&#151;he was involved in many committees and was a recipient of a number of honorary awards&#151;he remained primarily concerned with impressing his personal qualities on his associates, and he was regarded by his coevals and his younger colleagues with something akin to reverence. Wilkie's personal characteristics, derived from his liberal principles and his interpretation of religion in its broadest sense, made him someone who could be sympathetic to the troubles, anxieties, and ambitions of others. One of his junior colleagues said that &#145;his simple almost boyish charm commanded a positive joy in sharing service with him&#146;. He was also actively involved with the army medical advisory board, the British Empire Cancer Campaign, and the Medical Research Council (1933&#150;7). He was knighted in 1936.<br>
<br>Wilkie did not enjoy uniform good health. He had a severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage in 1937 and some time after this found a mass in his own abdomen. An attempt by his colleague Gordon Gordon-Taylor to remove this gastric cancer was unsuccessful, and Wilkie died in London on 28 August 1938. Much of his estate was gifted to the University of Edinburgh, to continue support for the department of surgery, and he is remembered <i>inter alia</i> by the Wilkie Laboratory, which the university court, in recognition of his services, caused to be so known.<br>
