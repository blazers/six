<span class="headword">Hooppell,  Robert Eli</span>  (1833&#150;1895), <span class="occ">antiquary and Church of England clergyman</span>, born in the parish of St Mary, Rotherhithe, London, on 30 January 1833, was the son of John Eli Hooppell, carpenter, and his wife, Mary Ann. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth's Free Grammar School, Horsleydown, and was admitted sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, on 30 June 1851. He was also a scholar of the college. In 1855 he graduated BA, being fortieth wrangler in the mathematical tripos, and in 1856 he obtained a first class in moral science. He proceeded MA in 1858, LLD in 1865, and was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Durham in 1876. He married at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, on 20 June 1855, Margaret, daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth Hooppell of Fishleigh, Devon.<br>
<br>From 1855 to 1861 Hooppell was second and mathematical master at Beaumaris grammar school. He later used his mathematics for a statistical paper on the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> read to the British Association in 1871. He was ordained deacon in 1857 and priest in 1859, and from 1859 to 1861 he served as English chaplain at Menai Bridge. In 1861 he was appointed first principal of Winterbottom Nautical College, South Shields, and he remained in that position until 1875, when he was instituted to the rectory of Byers Green, co. Durham. For the last year or two of his life he was in delicate health, and wintered at Bournemouth.<br>
<br>Hooppell served on the committee which superintended the excavation of the Roman camp at South Shields. His paper on the discoveries there (<span class="italic">Natural History Transactions of Northumberland</span>, 7, 1882, 126&#150;42) was the prelude to a lecture, published in 1879, on <span class="italic">Vinovium, the Buried Roman City at Binchester</span>, between Bishop Auckland and Byers Green, and in 1891 <span class="italic">Vinovia, a Buried Roman City</span>, with thirty-eight illustrations. The substance of this treatise appeared in the journal of the British Archaeological Association, and he contributed to the same journal for 1895 a paper on &#145;Roman Manchester and the roads to and from it&#146;. From 1877 he read papers on the names of Roman stations to the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries, and he contributed to the <span class="italic">Archaeologia Aeliana</span> and the <span class="italic">Illustrated Archaeologist</span>. His work on Vinovia has been largely superseded by later scholarship. His address, as president of the Tyneside Naturalists' Field Club, is in the <span class="italic">Natural History Transactions of Northumberland</span> (7.187&#150;206), and after his death there was published in 1898 a volume entitled <span class="italic">Rambles of an Antiquary</span>, comprising papers published in the <span class="italic">Newcastle Courant</span> in 1880 and 1881, chiefly on the antiquities of Northumberland and Durham.<br>
<br>Hooppell also published, in addition to several individual sermons, <span class="italic">Reason and Religion, or, The Leading Doctrines of Christianity</span> (1867; 2nd edn, 1895) and <span class="italic">Materialism: Has it any Real Foundation in Science?</span> (2nd edn, 1874). He died at The Burlington, Oxford Road, Bournemouth, on 23 August 1895, and was buried in Bournemouth cemetery. His wife, two sons, and a daughter survived him.<br>
