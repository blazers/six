<span class="headword">Heydon, Sir  Christopher</span>  (1561&#150;1623), <span class="occ">soldier and writer on astrology</span>, was born in Surrey on 14 August 1561, the eldest son of Sir William Heydon (1540&#150;1594) of Baconsthorpe, Norfolk, and his wife, Anne (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1540&#150;1603), daughter of Sir William Woodhouse of Hickling, Norfolk. The family had risen in the fifteenth century through the law, and enjoyed a powerful position in Norfolk affairs, with extensive lands and a palatial mansion at Baconsthorpe. Heydon was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he associated with the young earl of Essex, and after proceeding BA in 1579 travelled widely on the continent. In 1586, while still a young man, he stood for the Norfolk county seat, probably at his father's behest, against a family rival, Thomas Farmer. Though he was defeated his father appealed to the privy council, which ordered a fresh poll, and this time Heydon was declared elected. The Commons however challenged the council's constitutional right to interfere in electoral disputes, and the election was quashed. Heydon stood again for parliament in 1588, this time successfully.<br>
<br>Heydon married twice. His first wife, Mirabel, daughter of the London alderman Sir Thomas Rivet, died on 15 July 1593 aged only twenty-two and was buried at Saxlingham, another of the family estates. Heydon erected a massive and ornate tomb which virtually filled the chancel, covered with symbolic hieroglyphs and carvings explained in a treatise now lost. Like most of his family, Heydon was both extravagant and hot-tempered, and he was already embroiled in a bitter feud with his father. Deep in debt, Sir William had been forced to mortgage Baconsthorpe and only a series of royal protections kept his creditors at bay. In 1590 he decided to sell part of his property, a plan his son challenged on the grounds that the estates were entailed to him. When Sir William then threatened to demolish Baconsthorpe itself, out of spite, the younger man secured a prohibition from the privy council which condemned the plan as unnatural and likely to set a bad example. The dispute, which drew in many of the leading Norfolk families, dragged on for several years and led to a lawsuit between father and son in 1593. Sir William died the following year, bequeathing his estate to his widow instead of his son, and Heydon then went to law against her. She appealed to the queen, on whose order the lord keeper settled the dispute. Heydon was left liable for inherited debts of &pound;11,000, adding to his own of over &pound;3000. A second marriage, to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1642), daughter of John Dodge and widow of John Potts of Mannington, Norfolk, in or before 1599, brought him personal happiness but a large and growing family exacerbated his financial problems.<br>
<br>For many years Heydon was active in local government, serving as a justice from 1586 and again from 1598, and he was also a commissioner for musters in the late 1590s. However, his martial spirit and pressing debts eventually persuaded him to play for higher stakes. Throwing in his lot with the court favourite, the earl of Essex, he served in the Cadiz expedition of 1596, where he was knighted, and he would have joined Essex in Ireland in 1599 but for domestic entanglements. His younger brother John, who had earlier fought with Leicester in the Netherlands, did accompany Essex to Ireland, and was knighted there. By this time the Heydons were mired in both court and county rivalries, inflamed by their own combative spirit. In October 1600 Heydon challenged Sir John Townshend to a duel, averted only by the privy council's intervention. The council was too late to prevent a bloody duel near Norwich in the same month between Sir John Heydon and Sir Robert Mansell, when one of Heydon's hands was completely severed.<br>
<br>The declining fortunes of Essex were reflected in the shrinking local influence of the Heydons. Sir Christopher was forced to mortgage Baconsthorpe, and his attempt to block Mansell's election to the parliament called for 1601 backfired, Mansell jeering that his rival was shunned by the leading Norfolk families. The Heydons' prominent part in the Essex revolt in February 1601, when they both led rebel troops through Ludgate, spelt the end of their public careers: John fled to the Netherlands, while Heydon went into hiding, and opened a correspondence with Sir Robert Cecil in which he offered to surrender if Cecil would promise his favour. He swore he had joined Essex on the spur of the moment, ignorant of the real design, and that while devoted to his patron he had never intended any disloyalty to the queen. He offered to pay a fine, though pleading that massive debts and fourteen children left him with few resources. Perhaps surprisingly, Cecil accepted his protestations and worked to secure a pardon. Heydon was held in the Fleet prison for a time, but was eventually pardoned on paying a fine of &pound;2000. His brother returned to England in April 1602 to avoid outlawry. Heydon's financial plight remained desperate. In 1603&#150;5 Sir Edward Coke wrote several times to Cecil on behalf of the brothers, asking for Heydon to be given the farm of the customs for Norfolk, and Heydon himself petitioned his neighbour Sir Bassingbourne Gawdy, Cecil, and James I to similar effect. His problems remained unresolved, and in 1614 he was forced to mortgage the rest of his estates. In 1620 Heydon came to the council's attention once more, after reporting that a group of Norfolk recusants was collecting money to aid the Habsburgs against the protestants in Bohemia and Germany. He remained a champion of militant protestantism to the end.<br>
<br>Heydon enjoyed more lasting fame as a champion of astrology, an interest kindled by his friends Richard Forster, formerly physician to the earl of Leicester, and Richard Fletcher of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, mathematician, physician, and astrologer. His major publication was <span class="italic">A Defence of Judiciall Astrologie</span> (1603), a massive work drawing on his own extensive library, in which he rebutted John Chamber's <span class="italic">A Treatise Against Judiciall Astrologie</span> (1601); Heydon's domestic chaplain, William Bredon, himself a prominent astrologer, helped with the composition. In reply to Chamber, who had called for legislation to outlaw astrology, Heydon insisted it was a valid science, vindicated by experience and fully compatible with Christianity. His work demonstrated familiarity with Tycho Brahe and other modern authors, and he described some of his own astronomical observations with instruments made by his friend the mathematician Edward Wright.<br>
<br>Heydon's work was the most substantial English defence of astrology in its time, given additional weight by his social eminence and the absence of challenges. A critical response by Chamber remained unpublished, while a rejoinder by George Carleton, later bishop of Chichester, was published only twenty years later in 1624 as <span class="italic">The Madnesse of Astrologers</span>. In it Carleton pointed out, with some justice, that Heydon's work was more impressive for its learning than its logic. Heydon also composed an important treatise on the effects of the great conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 1603, and later phenomena up to the comet of 1618. His commentary on European political developments was strongly protestant and in apocalyptic vein. He predicted that the Dutch would crush their Arminian and Spanish enemies, and that Spain would also lose the Indies. From the upheavals in Bohemia he concluded that the Austrian Habsburgs would fall in 1623 and Rome in 1646, leading to the ruin of the Ottomans and the rise of Christ's kingdom, &#145;the fifth Monarchie of the World&#146;, about 1682  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole, 242, fol. 65). In a letter to Forster in 1603 he had mused whether the conjunction, the new star, and the great eclipse of the sun in 1605 might also foreshadow &#145;a new Democraty or Aristocraty of the Church and Commonwealth&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 242, fol. 16), a radical idea he incorporated in his treatise which also looked for a return to apostolic simplicity. Not surprisingly, his work remained unpublished. He also composed &#145;An astrological discourse with mathematical demonstrations&#146;, written around 1608, a defence of astrology drawing heavily on Kepler, with a briefer account of the 1603 conjunction. The manuscript remained in the possession of Forster until his death, when it passed to the astrologer Nicholas Fiske. Fiske's attempts to publish it were blocked, but it appeared in revised form in 1650, in the more favourable climate of the Commonwealth. Elias Ashmole subsidized the venture, with William Lilly supplying an admiring preface. Heydon also compiled elaborate prognostications for 1608 and 1609, which remained unpublished. He had astronomical as well as astrological interests, and for many years maintained a warm friendship with the eminent mathematician Henry Briggs and the astronomer John Bainbridge, sending them astronomical papers, lending instruments, and inviting them to Baconsthorpe.<br>
<br>Heydon died intestate in 1623 and was buried at Baconsthorpe. His widow, who died in 1642 aged seventy-five, chose to be buried beside him rather than by her first husband, in tribute to his &#145;conjugal affection&#146;  (Blomefield, 509). Heydon had several children by his first wife, and four daughters and a son by his second. His eldest son, Sir William, was killed on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; expedition of 1627; his second, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13168/', "Sir John Heydon")</script>, also a soldier, became lieutenant-general of the ordnance to Charles I during the civil war. Sir Christopher Heydon, though blessed with many talents, was far too impulsive to succeed in public life. In the world of learning, however, he played a significant part in fostering the renaissance of English astrology, while in fusing astrology with apocalyptic protestantism he foreshadowed some of the developments of the revolutionary era.<br>
