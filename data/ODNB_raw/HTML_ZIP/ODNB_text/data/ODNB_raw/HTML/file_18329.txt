</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mathews,  Charles</span>  (1776&#150;1835), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the seventh son of James Mathews, a bookseller and Wesleyan local preacher, and his wife, Elizabeth, was born on 28 June 1776 at 18 Strand, London. His youth was spent in his father's bookshop in Richmond, Surrey, where he acquired an early interest in the literature of the theatre. By the time he was twelve years old, he could usually be found in a large room above the nearby stable which he and a friend had converted into a theatre for the purpose of entertaining their youthful companions. After two years in that stable theatre, in 1790, at the age of fourteen, Charles Mathews applied to Henry Harris, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, for the position of leading comedian: Harris did not consider Mathews ready for leading comic business.<br>
<br>For three years Mathews studied the contemporary plays which the leading comedians of the day were performing and the classic comedies of Shakespeare and Jonson, building a repertory of roles. In September 1793 he paid the manager of the Richmond Theatre in Surrey 10 guineas for the privilege of playing Richmond in <span class="italic">Richard III</span> (he had selected the role for his d&eacute;but because it gave him a chance to display his fencing abilities against Richard in the last act). Two years later he accepted a position with a company of players in Dublin, and in September 1794 made his first appearance before an audience in comic imitations of famous actors. His imitations of Joseph Munden, John Kemble, and Mr Wathen were received with roars of laughter, marking his early beginnings in the area of impersonation.<br>
<br>One year later, in September 1795, disillusioned by lack of promotion, lack of salary, and lack of support, Mathews decided to give up the prospect of the stage and set sail for London. The ship, which also carried Montague Talbot, another actor, met rough weather and came to rest at Swansea. In an effort to profit from their enforced loss of time, Talbot and Mathews agreed to appear with the Swansea company for two nights. The venture led to a three-year stay with this provincial company, during which, on 19 September 1797, Mathews married Eliza Kirkham Strong (1772&#150;1802) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74208/', "Mathews, Eliza")</script>].<br>
<br>In January 1798 Mathews heard that John Emery, the principal comedian with the York company, was about to move to London, and he applied to Tate Wilkinson, the manager of the York company, for the vacated position. The York circuit was considered a nursery and preparatory school for metropolitan performers. In August 1798 he arrived in York, and by the end of 1799 he enjoyed all the roles he requested, and played leading comic business for the following three years. During that period his first wife died, and on 28 March 1803 he married Anne Jackson (<i>d</i>. 1869), an actress with the York company. Also during that three years he continued to perfect his imitations of the leading actors of the day, and he acquired a knack for ventriloquism.<br>
<br>On Monday 16 May 1803 Mathews made his London d&eacute;but, as Jabel in Richard Cumberland's <span class="italic">The Jew</span> and as Lingo in <span class="italic">The Agreeable Surprise</span>, under George Colman at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket. The following night he repeated the performance by command for King George III and his family. At the close of the 1803 season, after signing a contract with Colman for three further seasons, he joined the company at Liverpool for the winter. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18330/', "Charles James Mathews")</script>, the couple's only child, was born on 26 December 1803. Mathews's second season at the Haymarket was as successful as the first, and reviewers ranked him with the best London comedians, finding him less flippant than John Fawcett, as natural as John Bannister, and less laboured than Joseph Munden.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1804 Mathews and his wife signed a joint contract with the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, for five years. The following autumn (18 September 1804), as Don Manuel in Colley Cibber's comedy <span class="italic">She Would and She Would Not</span>, Mathews established himself as one of the leading comedians of London.<br>
<br>The summer of 1805 again found Mathews before the audiences of the Haymarket Theatre, and another new piece was written for him. More and more, he began to appear as a character who disguised himself as someone else. It was later said that he had the faculty of putting on another man's thoughts with his clothes, and many plays written for him were skeletons left for his elaboration. One year after Bannister's solo performance at Covent Garden in <span class="italic">Bannister's Budget</span> (1807), Mathews conceived the idea of performing an entertainment that would eliminate his dependence on provincial companies for work outside the London season. He constructed a &#145;solo&#146; entertainment and displayed it for the first time in Hull on 12 April 1808 (in fact his wife also took part in it).<br>
<br>This entertainment, called <span class="italic">The Mail Coach Adventure, or, Rambles in Yorkshire</span>, was intended solely for the consumption of the provincial audiences, and, when he created it, Mathews probably had no idea that ten years later it would launch him on a totally new career. The structure of this early entertainment&#151;provided by James Smith&#151;was crude and disjointed, with the last act, the monopolylogue that came to be Mathews's trademark, absent. Mrs Mathews played a minor role in <span class="italic">The Mail Coach Adventure</span>, and the couple performed this entertainment with some regularity nearly every season between 1808 and 1811, when Mrs Mathews retired from the company of two. In that latter year Mathews created his second entertainment, based on the first, <span class="italic">The Travellers, or, Hit or Miss</span>, this time joining forces with Charles Incledon.<br>
<br>The difference between the entertainment of 1808 and that of 1811 was that, instead of using the novelty as an intermittent rest from the regular drama, Mathews now began to produce it in a regularly scheduled tour of the provinces. This two-man show lasted only one season. There are some indications that the provinces saw Mathews periodically between 1812 and 1817 in a one-man version of <span class="italic">The Mail Coach Adventure</span>. In 1817 he wrote to his wife: &#145;During my performance at Brighton, Mrs George Farron's mother and sister went to see me &#147;At Home&#148;.&#146; This reference marks 1817 as the date Mathews first associated the title &#145;At Home&#146; with his entertainment. In that same year Mathews joined Frederick Yates to tour England with <span class="italic">The Actor of All Work</span>, and with him played the two-man show in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1809 Drury Lane burnt down and Mathews moved with the company to the Lyceum. He left in 1811 because of a disagreement with the management. After touring the provinces for a year, he returned to the city in 1812, this time to Covent Garden. From then until 1814 his career progressed smoothly. In the summer of that year he fell from his carriage and suffered a broken hip: the accident left him lame for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>After a brief retirement for rest and recovery, Mathews returned to Covent Garden to fulfil his contract, but he now walked with an obvious limp and was cast in the roles of gout-stricken old men, as he could no longer handle the demanding physical activity required for the leading comic roles. Finally, in 1816 Mathews asked Henry Harris, the manager, to release him from his contract. Harris agreed, but made Mathews promise not to play anywhere in London for its duration.<br>
<br>Mathews returned to the provinces. He appeared in Scotland and Ireland before returning to London for the summer season of 1817 at the Haymarket. The following autumn he appeared before London audiences for the first time in the one-man version of <span class="italic">The Mail Coach Adventure</span>. S. J. Arnold saw him perform and gave him a contract to appear at the English Opera House every spring for the next seven years. The title &#145;At Home&#146; was first used publicly by Mathews in London during the 1817 season. It was structured as a table entertainment in which a monologue provided the avenue for anecdote, jest, and song that carried his audience through a series of amusing adventures and provided the opportunity for imitations of all the human oddities encountered along the way. It was followed by a farce, in which he played multiple characters using his skills in quick changes and ventriloquy. The &#145;At Home&#146; was to be given annually in April and May, leaving Mathews free to tour the provinces for the remainder of the year. The &#145;At Homes&#146; succeeded, and the people of London and the provinces flocked to see them each year. Each new entertainment was the talk of the town for months before it began, and everyone speculated on the topic of the next one-man show. Annually, with the assistance of two or three highly gifted writers, Mathews devised new and varied delights. Richard Peake, James Smith, Charles James Mathews, and others contributed to the scripts.<br>
<br>In search of variety and material, and in hopes of large profits, Mathews devised a tour of America. He set sail in August 1822 and after thirty-five days at sea arrived at New York, then plagued by yellow fever. He opened in Baltimore, and he was triumphant. The critics universally praised his performances, and he was the hit of the season. The popular and critical success did not however, produce the financial bonanza he had anticipated. Mathews returned to England as <i>the</i> comedian of the age. After a summer of rest, he again entered the fray at the English Opera House for the month of August in the regular drama. Following another month in Dublin, he took up residence in London and retired for the winter to prepare his new entertainment. <span class="italic">A Trip to America</span>, perhaps his finest venture, opened at the English Opera House on 25 March 1824. From then until 1834, in the spring of each year apart from 1828, Mathews was &#145;At Home&#146; for forty nights. In addition, he played short-term engagements at the patent houses in the regular drama and undertook brief tours through the provinces. In 1828 there was no &#145;At Home&#146;, as Price, the manager of Drury Lane, offered him an extravagant salary to perform there for the 1827&#150;8 season. His nightly salary was then the highest ever paid to a comic performer.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1828 Mathews paid &pound;17,000 for a half-share of the Adelphi Theatre, and commenced as manager. The Adelphi held the &#145;At Homes&#146; until the death of the host. The last London &#145;At Home&#146; was in 1834, when Mathews advertised a succession of selections from his old entertainments. He was fifty-eight years old. He had spent forty of those years as a professional actor, but he could not retire, as, although he had earned large sums of money, bad investments had rendered him nearly impoverished. So, when an American agent came to him in the spring of 1834 and offered financial independence in exchange for another crossing of the Atlantic, Mathews accepted. The offer, the details of which have been obscured by time, would supposedly have made Mathews wealthy after only one year in the United States.<br>
<br>Mathews designed the tour himself. He intended to remain absent from England for at least eighteen months and possibly for as long as two years, because he wanted to extend his tour to the Canadian provinces. He had also decided to appear only in his monodramatic performances and to maintain his independence of the American managers. He was destined never to see Canada, and his dependence on the American managers was ordained before landing by the illness he contracted while on board ship. Before leaving England, however, he gave a farewell performance at Richmond on 25 July: his last performance in England was thus on the very stage where he first appeared in public in 1793.<br>
<br>With each day of the crossing Mathews became weaker, and by the time New York was in view he held in his lungs the infection that would kill him in less than a year. In addition to his illness, the tour had an awkward beginning: the public was somewhat opposed to his appearances because of the reports that had preceded him concerning his <span class="italic">A Trip to America</span> show. When he arrived at the theatre, he found bills posted calling him a scoundrel and an ungrateful slanderer, suggesting he be pelted from the stage for his insult to the American people in his London productions on their national character. In spite of this polemic, he appeared in his <span class="italic">A Trip to America</span>: his audience made no effort to hinder the production, and the entertainment was acclaimed throughout the American theatrical capitals.<br>
<br>The Philadelphia papers were universal in their praise, often comparing this visit with the first, marvelling at Mathews's ability &#145;to look through the windows of the heart&#146;. But behind the footlights Mathews was changed, even though he tried to hide his pain and discomfort as he brought himself before his auditors. By December 1834 his condition was worse, but still he clung to the American venture out of desperation. Notices regularly appeared indicating that he could not appear as the result of a severe cold. All the plans fell through. By January he had given up the &#145;At Homes&#146; entirely. He was forced to keep to the drama, being too weak to do his table acts because the necessary energy was too severe an exertion on his lungs. In six months he performed on only thirty-two nights. He had lost a year's income.<br>
<br>Mathews and his wife returned to England and arrived in Liverpool on 10 March 1835, after nineteen days at sea. Mathews died in Plymouth on 28 June 1835, his fifty-ninth birthday, and was buried there two days later at St Andrew's Church.<br>
