<span class="headword">Salkey,  (Felix) Andrew Alexander</span>  (1928&#150;1995), <span class="occ">writer and broadcaster</span>, was born on 30 January 1928 in Col&oacute;n, Panama, the eldest son of Andrew Alexander Salkey (1895&#150;1967), a worker in the canal zone, and his wife, Linda Gloria Marshall (1895&#150;1967). His parents were both from Jamaica, and at two he was sent back there to his grandmother, later to be joined by his mother and a younger brother: he was not to see his father again for thirty years. The living popular traditions of the island instilled in him a strong affection for Caribbean folklore. He was educated at St George's and Munro colleges, and had his first poems published in the island newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Gleaner</span>. In 1952 he emigrated to England, where he was to read for a BA and MA in English at University College, London. To survive financially he took on a succession of odd jobs which brought him in contact with West Indians from various walks of life, and their living conditions drew him to Marxism and protest against colonialism. He joined the League of Coloured Peoples, and the Movement for Colonial Freedom.<br>
<br>On 22 February 1958 Salkey married Patricia June Verden (<i>b</i>. 1935), a teacher. In that year he also began secondary schoolteaching. However, he had discovered his talent for radio work while still in Jamaica, contributing to the BBC programme <span class="italic">Caribbean Voices</span> from 1948. He soon left teaching to become a full-time freelance broadcaster, continuing to write and present material for the Caribbean, but also working for the Pacific, African, and General Overseas services of the BBC. He also made it his especial business to make contact with Caribbean writers. Quietly persuasive, with a gift for friendship and an encyclopaedic memory for people, Salkey with his wife Pat made their Bayswater flat a meeting point for immigrant authors and artists in London. Through his personal contacts with publishers, in particular Andr&eacute; Deutsch and Faber and Faber, he worked to get new West Indian writers published, and was responsible for persuading Faber to accept the work of the visionary Guyanese author Wilson Harris. He edited a series of anthologies, of which the most influential were <span class="italic">West Indian Stories</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Stories from the Caribbean</span> (1965), and a volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Breaklight</span> (1971). These collections showed remarkable insight in identifying the shape of an evolving Caribbean literary movement.<br>
<br>In 1966 the Barbadian poet and critic Edward Brathwaite was studying in England, and looked for a way to co-ordinate the creative arts of the Caribbean. He turned to Salkey and to John La Rose, a Trinidadian poet and publisher, with them launching the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM), which remained active in Britain until 1972. Through its conferences, meetings, and publications, CAM helped create a cultural base for the Caribbean arts, and for black British writers generally. Salkey's interests continued to be international. His radical sympathies gave him great hopes of the revolution in Cuba, and his visit there in 1967&#150;8 formed the basis for his travelogue <span class="italic">Havana Journal</span> (1971). He later edited <span class="italic">Writing in Cuba since the Revolution</span> (1977). After attending the seminal Caribbean Writers and Artists Conference at the founding of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana in 1970, he recorded his experiences in <span class="italic">Georgetown Journal</span> (1972). He had strong sympathies with Chile, and annually wrote the poems on the country's freedom cause which won him the 1979 Casa de las Americas prize, and were collected in <span class="italic">In the Hills where her Dreams Live</span> (1981).<br>
<br>Salkey's creative works included <span class="italic">A Quality of Violence</span> (1959), an account, partly drawing on his knowledge of Haiti, his mother's birthplace, of cultists in rural Jamaica at the time of the great drought of 1900. <span class="italic">Escape to an Autumn Pavement</span> (1960) began a series of picaresque novels, <span class="italic">The Late Emancipation of Jerry Stover</span> (1968), <span class="italic">The Adventures of Catullus Kelly</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">Come Home, Malcolm Heartland</span> (1976). These novels, set in England and the Caribbean, each focused on a young, deracinated black man seeking a meaningful identity in an increasingly bizarre and corrupt post-colonial world. The morally ambiguous careers of these anti-heroes may link them to the Caribbean folklore trickster figure Anancy the spiderman, who appears in character in Salkey's political parables, collected in <span class="italic">Anancy's Score</span> (1973), <span class="italic">One</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">Anancy, Traveller</span> (1992). Salkey also published four volumes of poetry, including the painstakingly researched historical epic of his homeland, <span class="italic">Jamaica</span> (1973), awarded the Thomas Helmore poetry prize. His children's story <span class="italic">Hurricane</span> (1964) won a Deutscher Kinderbuchpreis, and was the first of eight books for children. These featured young heroes as resourceful as the protagonists of his adult fiction were futile, facing, in the early stories, natural disasters and, in the later, political unrest.<br>
<br>A versatile and always professional writer, Salkey won literary honours which, in addition to those recorded above, included a Guggenheim award (1960) and the Sri Chinmoy award (1977). But he will be remembered in particular for his generosity of spirit and his tireless advocacy of the Caribbean arts. In a shifting world he kept his independent voice, remaining freelance as a broadcaster, and while most of his life an emigrant, staying a Jamaican citizen. In 1976 he left for the United States to become professor of creative writing at Hampshire College, Amherst, Massachusetts. He largely lived there until his death from a heart attack on 28 April 1995 at his home, 826 West Street, Amherst; he was survived by his wife and two sons. He was buried on 11 May in Paddington new cemetery, Mill Hill, London. A posthumous collection of his shorter pieces, <span class="italic">In the Border Country</span>, was published in 1998.<br>
