<span class="headword">Keppel,  Augustus</span>, Viscount Keppel  (1725&#150;1786), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15443/', "William Anne Keppel, second earl of Albemarle (1702&#150;1754)")</script>, and his wife, Anne (1703&#150;1789), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16449/', "Charles Lennox, first duke of Richmond")</script>, was born on 25 April 1725. His family were prominent whigs, and this background would prove highly significant for Keppel's future career.<h2>
<a name="Earlynavalcareer"></a>Early naval career</h2>In 1735 Keppel left Westminster School and, when aged ten, entered the navy on board the <i>Oxford</i> and served for two years on the coast of Guinea. There followed three years in the Mediterranean with Commodore Clinton in the <i>Gloucester</i>. Back in England, he moved in 1740 to the <i>Prince Frederick</i> and then to the <i>Centurion</i> (60 guns) with Commodore George Anson on his famous voyage of circumnavigation. Keppel was active in the various landings and captures, including that of the treasure-laden Acapulco galleon <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Covedanga</i>. Anson, his ever approving and influential patron, made him an acting lieutenant. On the <i>Centurion</i>'s return to England in 1744, Keppel passed his lieutenant's examination on 25 July and was at once confirmed in that rank. Scurvy had deprived him of many teeth and much hair, but he was fit enough to join the <i>Dreadnought</i> on 11 August. On 7 November he was made commander of the sloop <i>Wolf</i>, and on 11 December, when aged nineteen, he was posted to the frigate <i>Greyhound</i>.<br>
<br>In February 1745 Keppel shifted to the <i>Sapphire</i> (40 guns) and cruised off the south of Ireland with some success. From November he commanded the <i>Maidstone</i> (50 guns) and cruised for over a year in the soundings and the Bay of Biscay. Frustrated near Belle &Icirc;le by the escape of some small French vessels, Keppel, on 29 June 1747, pursued a large one. He ran onto hidden rocks and the <i>Maidstone</i> was wrecked. Having, with most of his crew, been rescued and made prisoner by the French, Keppel wrote with a patrician's easy assurance to Maurepas, the French navy minister, and was politely transported back to England, where he was exchanged. His men also soon returned. On 31 October a court martial acquitted Keppel of blame for the loss of his ship. Meanwhile the <i>Anson</i> (60 guns) was being built at Bursledon and in November Keppel was formally appointed to her. Until 21 December he sat on the court martial of Captain Thomas Fox, who had shown inadequate aggression on 14 October 1747. Edward Hawke's victory left few pickings for such as Keppel when cruising with that admiral in 1748.<br>
<br>After peace was concluded in October, Keppel was specially favoured by being appointed in 1749, when aged twenty-four, as commodore commanding in the Mediterranean. He was to apply judicious pressure to the dey of Algiers, ruler of a port that had long been a nest of piratical activity. Wearing his broad pennant in the <i>Centurion</i> (now reduced to 50 guns), Keppel took with him a youthful Joshua Reynolds&#151;an act of patronage very welcome at that early stage of the painter's career. He sailed in July, and during the next two years visited Lisbon, Cadiz, Gibraltar, Algiers, and Mahon; and Reynolds wrote to Lord Edgecumbe: &#145;I have had the use of his cabin and his study of books, as if they were my own&#146;  (Keppel, 1.148). Eventually Keppel concluded an agreement with the dey protective of British commerce. Having also negotiated treaties at Tripoli and Tunis, he returned to England in July 1751.<br>
<br>In 1754 the slide towards a new French war saw Keppel again appointed as a commodore. In February 1755, with the <i>Centurion</i> and the <i>Norwich</i>, he took General Edward Braddock's transports into Hampton Roads. Late in July he was superseded due to Vice-Admiral Edward Boscawen's arrival on the American coast and on 22 August he returned to England with news of Braddock's defeat and death. Four days later he was ordered to commission the <i>Swiftsure</i> of 70 guns. It was in 1755 that he was elected an MP for Chichester, a seat vacated by his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15441/', "George Keppel")</script>, on succeeding as third earl of Albemarle.<br>
<br>In June 1756 Keppel moved to the <i>Torbay</i> (74 guns), his favourite ship, in which he remained until 1761. By then he was established as one of the most popular and best-regarded captains in the navy&#151;affectionately called &#145;little Keppel&#146; by the sailors  (Keppel, 2.235). There was, wrote Boscawen, &#145;no better seaman than Keppel, few so good, and not a better officer&#146;  (Rodger, <span class="italic">Wooden World</span>, 260). Meanwhile, having commanded a small squadron off Cape Finisterre and taken three French prizes, he returned in December to Spithead. In January he sat as a member of John Byng's court martial. Surprised by the ineffectiveness of the court's recommendation to mercy, he tried, ultimately without success, to persuade parliament to intervene. On 24 June 1757 he sailed with Boscawen and, having been detached with the <i>Medway</i> (60 guns), took a rich prize. In September he took part in the disappointing Rochefort expedition. Nothing that Admiral Hawke and the fleet could do succeeded in persuading the army to land. Again under Hawke, in March 1758 Keppel participated in his foray into the Basque Roads. Later that year he was with the fleet under Anson. In September he was appointed to command the naval side of a joint expedition to Goree, a French settlement of some strategic significance on the west African coast. On 29 December Goree was duly taken.<br>
<br>From May 1759 Keppel participated in Hawke's strategically crucial blockade of Brest, following which the <i>Torbay</i> was prominent at the conclusive battle of Quiberon Bay, fought on 20 November in a forty-knot gale. Under attack by the <i>Torbay</i>, the <i>Thes&eacute;e</i>, also of 74 guns, foundered with horrifying abruptness. True to what Keppel deemed a very &#145;English&#146; penchant for &#145;humanity and pity&#146;  (Keppel, 1.446), he immediately hoisted out boats and, despite the perilous conditions, a number of French lives were saved.<br>
<br>The fleet at Brest having been reduced to a remnant, Keppel was in March 1761 chosen to command the naval part of a major joint expedition to take Belle &Icirc;le. Wearing his broad pennant in the <i>Valiant</i> (74 guns), he had his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Adam Duncan with him as flag captain. By June the operations had been crowned with success, relations between army and navy&#151;so frequently difficult&#151;having been notably good. Keppel continued to command off Brest and Belle &Icirc;le until January 1762. Now, with Spain entering the war on the side of France, the cabinet decided to attack Havana. The preliminary planning was done by Anson. Admiral George Pocock was the naval commander and Keppel's elder brother, Lord Albemarle, commanded the army. Augustus Keppel was appointed as commodore and naval second in command. Though rightly dubious about Captain Augustus Hervey's proposal to bombard the fortress El Morro from the sea, Keppel gave solid support. The fortress was taken after six weeks of hard fighting, before yellow fever quite prevailed. On 11 August Havana itself surrendered. The three Keppels&#151;Albemarle, Augustus, and Major-General William&#151;were hugely enriched by their share of the enormous prize money. The commodore received nearly &pound;25,000. However, his health had suffered severely. Overall, the enterprise has been rated a masterpiece of planning, amphibious warfare, and naval prowess. On 21 October 1762 a promotion of captains to flag rank was extended to include Keppel, who at thirty-seven became a rear-admiral of the blue. He remained in command at Jamaica until January 1764 and did not reach England until June.<h2>
<a name="Politicaladmiral17651778"></a>Political admiral, 1765&#150;1778</h2>By 1765 Keppel, who was an MP for Windsor from 1761 to 1780, had become actively involved in politics. Together with his able cousin, the duke of Richmond, and his friend and legatee Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Saunders, he was attached to the opposition leader, the marquess of Rockingham. In Rockingham's first administration (July 1765 to July 1766) Saunders and Keppel were naval lords at the Admiralty, and when Grafton succeeded Rockingham at the Treasury Saunders became first lord with Keppel now a senior commissioner. Keppel saw the need to improve Portsmouth Dockyard before any new conflict with France and Spain. However, on 27 November, to the king's understandable displeasure, Saunders and Keppel both resigned over the dismissal of Rear-Admiral Lord Edgecumbe, a fellow Rockingham whig, as groom of the bedchamber. While valued primarily for his naval knowledge and reputation, Keppel had become, by 1767, a leading member of the Rockingham faction.<br>
<br>From October 1770 until January 1771 war with France and Spain threatened over the Falkland Islands and Keppel, having been promoted on 18 October 1770 to rear-admiral of the red, was again promoted on the 24th to vice-admiral of the blue, apparently with a view to his commanding the Channel Fleet. However, this did not silence Saunders and Keppel in their parliamentary criticisms of the Admiralty. With Lord Sandwich establishing himself ever more firmly as first lord of the Admiralty in Lord North's administration, Keppel's adherence to the opposition left him awkwardly placed as an admiral should war supervene. In November 1776 the king did ask him, as the obvious candidate (and a vice-admiral of the red since February), to be ready to command the fleet. His cousin Richmond warned Keppel that, however unfairly, blame for any subsequent naval reverse might be laid on him. The fact that the Rockinghams publicly sympathized with the rebellion of the American colonists did not endear them to the king and his ministers. The matter of Keppel's health also deserves notice. He seems never to have fully recovered from the fevers of Havana. His illnesses are mentioned in letters of 1765 and 1772; and in 1776 Keppel tells Rockingham that, having endured &#145;torments&#146; from prolonged recourse to the waters of Spa, he is thankful to revert to his &#145;usual degree of pain&#146;  (Keppel, 1.425).<h2>
<a name="ThebattleofUshant1778"></a>The battle of Ushant, 1778</h2>By early 1778 France and Spain were ready to go to war. Britain, on the other hand, was burdened with heavy American commitments. As Keppel and Richmond had remarked in parliament, these commitments had left the British holding no fleet manoeuvres, whereas the French and Spanish had exercised ships of the line together. The allies, moreover, had overwhelming numbers of ships, many of them ready to fight. Privately, Sandwich and the Admiralty found the situation alarming.<br>
<br>Keppel, having been promoted on 29 January to admiral of the blue, was appointed on 18 March to command the Grand Fleet. Writing to Lord Rockingham, Keppel hoped that his indifferent health would permit him to rise to the unpromising situation. It is a sign of Keppel's continuing naval expertise that he had already, on the 10th, asked for the 42-pound guns on the lower deck of his assigned flagship, the <i>Victory</i>, to be replaced by 32-pounders.<br>
<br>On 24 March Keppel went down to Portsmouth and hoisted his flag. He found only six ships of the line, instead of the promised thirty-five, ready for the sea. Men, stores, and provisions were deficient. By May, however, a considerable force had been assembled, but early in June, to the detriment of the Channel Fleet, thirteen of the line were sent away to New York. Meanwhile Keppel had closely questioned Sandwich about the strategic options likely to confront him. The Admiralty's guidance was issued in secret instructions dated 25 April. If, for example, Keppel discovered that the Brest squadron was superior to his, he was to fight if the superiority in numbers was not very apparent. However, should the enemy fleet, whether at sea or in port, prove manifestly superior, he was to retire to St Helens, where reinforcements would be gathering. Again, since neither France nor Spain had actually declared war, Keppel was not to attack their shipping if it was innocuous.<br>
<br>On 13 June Keppel sailed towards Brest with twenty-one of the line. Two French frigates precipitated a brush and the French government dated hostilities from 17 June. From prisoners taken, Keppel concluded that thirty-two ships of the line were ready for sea at Brest and he therefore fell back to St Helens, as instructed. Angry merchants blamed the unreadiness of the Admiralty.<br>
<br>Keppel sailed again on 9 July and by the 11th he had thirty ships of the line. In the <i>Victory</i> (100 guns) his estimable old friend Rear-Admiral John Campbell was, at his own request, Keppel's first captain. Robert Harland, a captain under Hawke on 14 October 1747 and now a vice-admiral of the blue, commanded the van division. In command of the rear division was a more junior vice-admiral of the blue, Sir Hugh Palliser. He was a highly competent officer who had been controller of the navy and knew well its material strength and weaknesses. Less fortunate, certainly from Keppel's viewpoint, was Palliser's membership, latterly as senior naval lord, of Sandwich's Board of Admiralty. Should a reverse be suffered, the potential for recrimination was considerable.<br>
<br>On 8 July the French fleet had issued from Brest under the command of the comte d'Orvilliers, furnished with vacillating instructions which induced caution. Owing to thick weather, it was not until the 23rd that d'Orvilliers sighted the British line. Overnight he passed ahead of it to gain the weather gauge, but during the manoeuvre two of his ships became separated to leeward and had to go into Brest. Now he also had thirty of the line and some frigates.<br>
<br>Having been foiled by d'Orvilliers's nocturnal manoeuvre, Keppel had to work from leeward, in foggy, squally, unsettled weather, to close on his enemy. He knew that nothing short of a decisive naval victory could wrest the strategic initiative from the Bourbon powers. On 27 July, with the wind continuing west-south-west, both fleets stood to the north-west. Endeavouring to converge on the now visible French, Keppel, somewhat like Hawke in November 1759, hoisted the general chase signal early in the day. At 9 a.m. the French wore in succession so that their admiral, by closing the gap, could see Keppel's chasing fleet more clearly. Towards 10 a.m. the wind backed southwards by two points (22&deg;), affording Keppel a better chance of closing. Soon afterwards he tacked, still without signalling a line of battle, so as to close on the rear of the enemy. In a squall of rain, the wind veered, making it easier for the British to get within range. Meanwhile, however, hidden in the rain, d'Orvilliers realized that action could no longer be avoided. He again changed course so that the two fleets were now heading towards each other on opposite tacks. D'Orvilliers had thus adroitly avoided Keppel's threatened concentration on his rear. Having at last converged close enough to be able to engage his elusive enemy, Keppel, who had avoided the loss of time consequent on signalling a line of battle, did not hoist that signal now. Improving on Thomas Mathews's notorious failure to cope with a somewhat similar situation in 1744, he simply hoisted the flag to engage. The two fleets, very roughly in a line, but with the French in somewhat better order, approached each other with the French further off the wind (still at west-south-west) than the British, so that Harland's van division was further from the enemy than was Palliser's rear division. Palliser's ships and some of Keppel's, including the <i>Victory</i>, therefore received successively the fire of most of the French fleet. Five British ships were crippled and fell away to leeward.<br>
<br>At 1 p.m. d'Orvilliers, having passed clear of the British, signalled to wear in succession, so that, by standing southward, he could engage Keppel, also now standing south, from leeward. Keppel manoeuvred to cover his crippled ships. With a view to counter-attacking the enemy, he signalled for Palliser to come to his support. Palliser's division, endeavouring to repair the considerable damage suffered, was lying to, having by then fallen astern and to windward of Keppel's centre division. Palliser afterwards claimed that the signal was hidden from him. Keppel may well have expressed frustration at the time. He sent a frigate to communicate with Palliser by speaking-trumpet, a fact tellingly (if one-sidedly) confirmed at Keppel's trial. Anyhow, the incident had no bearing on the outcome of the action because d'Orvilliers, having had trouble with his own communications, abandoned his chance to attack Keppel's ships from leeward. D'Orvilliers had had the best of it in terms of manoeuvre and damage to the mobility of the British. He had denied Keppel the decisive victory that could have given Britain the strategic initiative in the war. D'Orvilliers therefore retired to Brest to make good his damages. Because the British, as was their habit, had concentrated their fire on the hulls rather than the masts of their enemy, the French casualties were somewhat heavier&#151;according to John Creswell 163 killed and 573 wounded against 133 killed and 375 wounded in Keppel's fleet. But British hulls had also suffered. The hull of Palliser's flagship, the <i>Formidable</i> (90 guns), suffered more than seventy shot-holes, five of them under water.<br>
<br>On 29 July Keppel wrote to Sandwich, with whom he had maintained quite good relations (as indeed he had with Palliser): &#145;The object of the French was at our masts and rigging, and they have crippled the fleet in that respect beyond any degree I ever saw&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Papers of &hellip; Sandwich</span>, 2.128). Light is thrown on the improved gunnery of the French by Palliser's letter to Sandwich of 10 August, in which he says that the French gunners were more effective than numbers of their often little-trained British counterparts, owing to the French corps of seaman gunners (established in 1767). Palliser also complained of the incomplete work of the Ordnance department when preparing the fleet for sea.<br>
<br>At the battle of Ushant, given that he did not enjoy that clear-cut ship-for-ship superiority that he and most British admirals of the century had been wont to assume, Keppel had, considering his continuing poor health, behaved with obvious spirit. Remembering also some disadvantage by way of previous fleet exercises, his tactical handling of the action against a skilful, evasive foe may be rated as more than adequate.<h2>
<a name="TheKeppelPalliseraffair"></a>The Keppel&#150;Palliser affair</h2>In August Keppel wrote to Sandwich praising the efforts of all his admirals in getting the fleet ready to sail again from Portsmouth. Keppel, hoping for a more conclusive encounter with the French, sailed again with the fleet on 23 August. He cruised off Ushant without achieving contact with the French. Meanwhile, by 28 October when he returned to Spithead, the fuse for the Keppel&#150;Palliser affair had been lit. An account of Keppel's frustration at the time of Palliser's failure or inability to respond to his signals during the afternoon of the battle had appeared in a newspaper. The sensitive Palliser prepared a laudatory and exculpatory letter for Keppel to sign for publication. This Keppel refused to do. More papers took up the story, which received mention in the House of Commons. On 9 December Palliser presented to the Board of Admiralty, of which he was still a member, a demand for Keppel's court martial&#151;a demand disastrous for his own career and damaging to the cohesion of the navy.<br>
<br>With Sandwich and the government coming under attack, the Admiralty was perhaps over-prompt in immediately issuing orders for Keppel to be tried. The opposition was much incensed, as indeed were most of the officers in the navy. The five rather absurd but capital charges held that Keppel had improperly and half-heartedly marshalled his fleet, approached the fight in a manner unbecoming an officer, shown undue haste in quitting the conflict, run away from the scene, and failed to pursue the enemy. Until this point the relationship between Keppel and Sandwich had been maintained on a very reasonable footing. Now, at a blow, that mistrust of Sandwich previously expressed to Keppel by such as Richmond was apparently justified. Horace Walpole, himself an opposition whig, makes the most of the affair. Richmond had recently again been hounding Sandwich in parliament. Therefore (writes Walpole) Sandwich, who had been &#145;cunning&#146; and &#145;treacherous&#146; towards Wilkes, &#145;could not resist the impulse of attacking Keppel with the same arms&#146;&#151;that admiral being &#145;cousin-german and dear friend&#146; of Richmond. In the Commons on 12 December Temple Luttrell moved for Palliser (also an MP) to be court-martialled himself &#145;for disobedience of signals&#146;. Palliser, for his part, explained that he had waited for five months before charging Keppel because it was only the other day that Keppel &#145;had declared that he would serve with him no more&#146;. Keppel himself spoke &#145;with a mixture of pathetic modesty and sublime dignity&#146;. He said that the &#145;charges attacked both his life and his fame&#146; and he called for the trial &#145;to clear both, though he lamented the mischiefs&#146; that it might occasion. His &#145;few sentences were littered with so much majesty and grace that the House melted into tears&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>, 2.222&#150;5). Most naval officers, with the venerable Lord Hawke at their head, expressed outrage at the decision to have Keppel tried.<br>
<br>On 9 January 1779 the court martial began at Portsmouth and continued for five weeks. Thirty captains, some lieutenants, and several masters testified. Together with the admirals Harland and Campbell, nearly all the witnesses (with Captain John Jervis particularly effective) refuted the charges to the noisy satisfaction of Keppel's relatives, friends, and political allies who attended each day in his support. Among them were the marquess of Rockingham, two royal dukes, Richmond and two other dukes, and Keppel's second cousin Charles James Fox, together with Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Edmund Burke. During the trial Palliser's manner was &#145;poor and passionate&#146;, while Keppel's was &#145;cool&#146;, &#145;temperate and modest&#146;. &#145;Keppel stood to hear his own praises sounded higher even than he had grounds to expect; Palliser saw himself the opprobrium and outcast of his profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>, 2.245). On 11 February the court pronounced the charges malicious and unfounded. That evening there were riotous celebrations in London and elsewhere. Popular resentment was vented on Palliser's London house and on the gates of the Admiralty. Keppel became a national hero. Palliser had soon to face his own court martial. Though exonerated, he lost all his appointments.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Keppel, whose health had not improved, declined in any case to serve again under Sandwich, and some other flag officers made similar damaging gestures. Although dissension in the service persisted for a time, Keppel began to lose some of his popularity as he continued, despite the war, to denounce the administration. In 1780 Rockingham fruitlessly nominated Keppel (from September MP for Surrey) as first lord of the Admiralty. Finally the news of Yorktown led to Rockingham's second administration and, in March 1782, Keppel became first lord. Having been on 8 April promoted admiral of the white, on 26 April he was raised to the peerage by an unenthusiastic George III as Viscount Keppel and Baron Elden. In office Keppel accomplished little of note. He appointed some of his strong supporters, such as Samuel Barrington and Hyde Parker, to important seagoing commands and gave Harland a seat at the Admiralty. His decision to replace Rodney with Admiral Hugh Pigot proved embarrassing when news soon afterwards arrived of Rodney's victory at the Saints. Despite his diplomatic skills, he found, like other first lords, that he could not work well with that indispensable controller of the navy Charles Middleton. After Rockingham died in April, Keppel remained uncomfortably in Shelburne's administration. Unhappy with the peace preliminaries, he resigned in December, and was replaced at the Admiralty by Lord Howe. From April 1783 he was again first lord until the Fox&#150;North coalition was dismissed in December.<br>
<br>Keppel quite cheerfully bore worsening infirmities until he died on 2 October 1786. He had never married, though he apparently kept mistresses, for instance in 1758 and 1763. His title died with him. Small in stature, with a nose permanently dented by a blow received early on from a footpad, he left an indelible impression of cheerful agreeability and charm, coupled with an underlying firmness in getting his way. By 1778, however, he was corpulent and&#151;often with good reason&#151;more inclined to gloom. Up to 1762 his naval career, especially in combined operations, had been outstanding. Thereafter his political interests complicated and tended to limit his naval achievements.<br>
