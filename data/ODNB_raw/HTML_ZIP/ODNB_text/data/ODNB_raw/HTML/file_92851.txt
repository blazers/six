<span class="headword">Flemming,  John Stanton</span>  (1941&#150;2003), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 6 February 1941 at Lenia House, Bath Road, Reading, the younger son and, with his twin sister, the youngest of the four children of Sir Gilbert Nicolson Flemming (1897&#150;1981), civil servant, and his wife, Virginia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coit, of 73 Carnarvon Road, Forest Gate, London. At the time of his birth his father was secretary to the wartime production executive; he later rose to be permanent secretary at the Department of Education, and was made a KCB in 1953. Like many of his generation, Gilbert Flemming had been deeply influenced by the poverty he had witnessed as a young man in the East End of London, and he remained throughout his life a man of the left.<br>
<br>John Flemming was educated at Rugby School, where he specialized in mathematics. He seems to have been reasonably happy and successful there, but his outstanding qualities did not really blossom until he went as an undergraduate to Trinity College, Oxford. He took a first in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1962, and then went as a graduate student to Nuffield College. Only a year later he was offered and accepted a position as official fellow and tutor in economics at Oriel College. In 1963 also he made what has rightly been called the best choice of his life when on 27 July he married Jean Elizabeth Briggs, a 27-year-old schoolteacher, and daughter of George Briggs, decorating contractor. Their characters were complementary rather than similar. They made an ideal match, and had a happy family life for forty years. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Flemming was a good tutorial teacher to those students who were already highly motivated, but the heavy burden of run-of-the-mill tutorials that fell to an Oxford college tutor at that time was not his m&eacute;tier. He did well to return in 1965 to Nuffield as an official fellow, a research appointment. He remained a fellow of Nuffield until 1980. This was his most productive period as an academic economist.<br>
<br>In that capacity Flemming was cast in a mould that was&#151;at that time&#151;characteristically British. He did not confine himself to a single field but ranged widely, believing that the basic principles of economics had general application. His breadth had a certain cost: he produced many subtle and ingenious papers, but no <i>magnum opus</i>. Perhaps the best-known of his original ideas related to the possibility of &#145;changes of gear&#146; in price-expectations, an idea put forward in chapter seven of his short but pithy <span class="italic">Inflation</span> (1976)&#151;his only book. The idea was that people's expectations about inflation may focus on the level of prices, or on the rate of increase of prices, or on the rate of acceleration of price-increase, or at least in principle on some even higher derivative; and that a shift between gears might be particularly important in times of rapid inflation, such as prevailed at the time he was writing the book. Most of Flemming's publications were theoretical, but he also did some good empirical work, for example the derivation of widely cited measures of the cost of capital to firms.<br>
<br>While he was an official fellow at Nuffield Flemming spent a year on secondment to the Bank of England. This prepared the way for him to take up later, in 1980, a full-time appointment as senior economist at the bank. He presently became economic adviser to the governor (1984&#150;8) and then one of the bank's executive directors (1988&#150;91). In 1991 he rather surprised some of his friends by leaving the bank and moving to become chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD was a new body, set up on the initiative of President Mitterrand of France, with a French head, Jacques Attali, but with its head office in London (a political compromise). Its intended task was to perform, in relation to the former Soviet Union and the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe, a function rather like that performed by the World Bank in relation to developing countries, but with special attention to the problems of transition from a planned economy to a market one.<br>
<br>As a staff economist at the Bank of England and at the EBRD Flemming excelled in inspiring the work of his subordinates, so contributing to the academic reputation of the organizations. His awareness of there being two sides to most questions was not always welcome to his superiors. What they sometimes wanted, but did not get from Flemming, was a spirited statement of a particular view. As a result he probably had less influence at the time on policy thinking within the Bank of England than his imaginative but sometimes eccentric predecessor, Christopher Dow, had had. But the policies later practised through the bank's monetary policy committee probably owed more to Flemming than they did to Dow.<br>
<br>Flemming did good work during his time at the EBRD, but he was conscious of a certain lack of clarity in its remit. Matters were not made easier for him by the powerful personality of the EBRD's head, who, among other things, found it easier to work with the French-speaking members of his staff. So, while retaining his interest in the economics of transition, Flemming was not sorry after only a couple of years to return to Oxford to become warden of Wadham College. Even during the many years when he was working in London he had continued to live in Oxford, commuting daily. Indeed, he was once described as an Oxford don who happened to be working in London, rather than a public servant who happened to live in Oxford. It was appropriate that he should end his career as head of an Oxford college.<br>
<br>Being warden of Wadham was perhaps the most congenial phase of Flemming's career. Despite his many outside activities, he was an active, hands-on warden. He sought by means of his experienced skills in chairmanship to guide the college towards its own consensus, exercising only a steady hand on the tiller. He and his wife, Jean, liked living in the warden's lodgings and taking a full part in the life of the college. He was extremely popular among the fellows and he enjoyed their company and the company of students alike. He also made valued contributions in the central affairs of the university, notably as chairman of the committee charged with the invidious task of reviewing the rules about redistribution of income between colleges.<br>
<br>Flemming was highly intelligent, judicious, widely informed, moderate, unpompous, and averse to confrontation, though capable of giving a firm lead. He made no enemies. These characteristics were apparent in the way he performed all the roles of his career: as academic economist, as public sector staff economist and adviser, as a leader among British economists, and as academic administrator. Apart from his career appointments, his non-egocentric, unpushy, but incisive style made him a natural choice as a part-time member or chairman of committees and as part-time administrator, both in bodies of economists and in bodies where an economic contribution was needed. The number of such appointments (many of them very responsible and time-consuming) that he held at one time or another was remarkable. He was, <i>inter alia</i>, editor of the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span> (1976&#150;80), chairman of the economic affairs committee of the Social Science Research Council (1981&#150;4), a member of the Advisory Board on Research Councils (1986&#150;91), chairman of the council of management of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (1996&#150;2002), and a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution (1995&#150;2003). On the financial side he was investment bursar of Nuffield College, treasurer of the Royal Economic Society and of the British Academy, and chairman of the investment and finance committees of Brunel University. He took much interest in Brunel, and the university conferred an honorary doctorate on him in 2003 (&#145;my first post-graduate degree&#146;, he said).<br>
<br>Flemming was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1991 and appointed CBE in 2001. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2000, but bore his illness with courage and dignity. He died at the warden's lodgings, Wadham College, on 5 August 2003, and was survived by his wife, Jean, and their four children.<br>
