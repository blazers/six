<span class="headword">Mawe,  Leonard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1629), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was born in Rendlesham, Suffolk, the fourth son of Simon Mawe, gentleman, and his wife, Margery, daughter of Thomas and Alice Wyld. He went up to Cambridge at Easter 1588, a pensioner at Peterhouse. He quickly attracted attention from influential friends and, in May 1594, secured a royal mandate for election to the next vacant fellowship. He was admitted a fellow of Peterhouse in 1595 and proceeded MA the following year. He was bursar for a year in 1599 and incorporated at Oxford in the same year. Further privilege followed. In 1604 he was granted royal dispensation to hold his fellowship in plurality with the benefice of Mildenhall, Suffolk, and in 1611 the king instructed the vice-chancellor and heads of house at Cambridge to admit Mawe as DD, dispensing with the statutes for the degree and the requirement that he should first have proceeded BD. Not all the attention he received was, however, welcome. Proctor from 1609, his speech at the commencement in 1610 was an attack on the further reformation of the church which enraged the House of Commons. None the less, he became master of Peterhouse in November 1617. In 1621 he served as vice-chancellor and added the rectory of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, to his preferments.<br>
<br>Mawe also held a prebend at Wells, and was chaplain to Charles, prince of Wales. When Charles was in Spain in 1623 King James sent Mawe and Matthew Wren, afterwards bishop of Ely, along with other officers and attendants, to join him, charging the chaplains to set up a chapel and to hold prayers twice a day, in an attempt to commend the Anglican faith to the Spanish. Mawe and his companions set sail on 3 April. During his journey through Spain he had a fall from his mule, &#145;lighting on his head and shoulders&#146;  (Wynn). The prince was obliged to send orders that the greater part of the company was to return to England without going on to Madrid, and Mawe returned through France.<br>
<br>As a reward for his services Mawe was appointed master of Trinity College, Cambridge, by patent in 1625. Although as master he did much towards freeing that foundation from a heavy debt, his primary loyalty remained with Peterhouse, &#145;my ancient nurse from which I received so many blessings and favours&#146;, to which he left in his will &pound;300 towards the leading of the chapel roof  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/156, fol. 152). He used all his influence to secure the election of the duke of Buckingham as chancellor of Cambridge in 1626, summoning the fellows of Trinity one by one to browbeat them into voting for the duke.<br>
<br>In 1628 Mawe received the see of Bath and Wells in succession to William Laud, being elected on 24 June and consecrated at Croydon on 7 September. &#145;A good scholar, a grave preacher, a mild man, and one of gentle deportment&#146;  (Fuller, 2.333), with an extensive library (he left &#145;books of all sorts&#146;, including Spanish works and history), he seems to have been reluctant to leave Cambridge for Wells, &#145;unworthy of that high honor and calling&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/156, fol. 152). Although in 1629 he issued a conventional set of episcopal visitation articles, he was absent from the visitation itself in July and August. By 11 August he had received letters from the king desiring him to quit Cambridge, but dispensing him from residence in episcopal houses owing to ill health. Mawe may never have reached Wells for he died in Chiswick, home of his sister's family, on 2 September 1629. Apparently unmarried, he bequeathed to his cousin, nephews, and nieces his &#145;worldly goods which are not many (for I never hadd, nor cared to have much)&#146;  (ibid.), but amounting none the less to over &pound;1400 and including property in Lincolnshire and Suffolk, inherited from his father and his brother Charles. He was buried in Chiswick parish church.<br>
