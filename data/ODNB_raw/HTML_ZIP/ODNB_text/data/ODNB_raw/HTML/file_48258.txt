<span class="headword">Herries, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1731&#150;1815), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was the eldest son of William Herries of Halldykes in Dryfesdale, Dumfriesshire, a distant descendant of the lords Herries of Terregles, and his first wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henderson. He had two brothers, two half-brothers, and one half-sister.<br>
<br>In 1750 Herries was sent out as an apprentice to his uncles Robert and Charles, who were merchants in Rotterdam. His ability was noted by the Amsterdam bankers and traders Hope &amp; Co., whose connections were to serve him well. In 1754 he set himself up in Barcelona as a brandy merchant and took out his two younger brothers, Charles and William. He also acquired business interests in Montpellier and Valencia. While visiting Edinburgh in 1761 he was persuaded by John Coutts to become a partner in the Coutts' London commission house in Jeffrey's Square. This firm became Herries, Cochrane &amp; Co. in 1762 with a sudden loss of Coutts family interests, caused partly by their attention to the new Coutts Bank in the Strand.<br>
<br>Herries soon quarrelled with the Coutts brothers over control at Jeffrey's Square. The brothers had retained a right of recruiting to the partnership, but Herries felt they were no more entitled to appoint him a colleague than to choose him a wife. In January 1766, with Cochrane removed, the firm was restyled Herries &amp; Co., in which the Coutts' Edinburgh house was represented by William Forbes and James Hunter. With Forbes as a confidant, Herries evolved his idea for a new monetary service for the grand tour, a market which he estimated as worth &pound;1.5 million per annum. Bills of exchange and the more usual letters of credit were both disadvantaged, the former by inflexibility, the latter by fees paid at each withdrawal. A network of agencies was to be set up across Europe where travellers could encash sterling &#145;circular notes&#146; (forerunners of travellers' cheques) without deduction. The agents were paid commission by Herries, whose own profit was in the use of money taken for the notes before a journey began. Other types of instrument, especially a &#145;transferable note&#146;, were also introduced.<br>
<br>In 1769 Herries tried to implement his plan through Messrs Coutts. Rebuffed, he set up the London Exchange Banking Company at 16 St James's Street, and advertised his new service; partners included his uncle Robert Herries, and Forbes and Hunter. With the help of Hope &amp; Co., some eighty agencies were established across Europe by 1770, rising to 141 some twenty years later, with two in Asia. Herries was at first resented by other bankers, who feared, quite rightly, that he was also poaching a client base for a conventional private bank. When he was knighted in 1774, the Exchange Bank became known as Sir Robert Herries &amp; Co. The circular note scheme, soon widely copied, was temporarily checked by the French wars, but restarted in 1815.<br>
<br>Within Britain and the West Indies, Herries tried other monetary innovations, all abortive. He also pursued mercantile interests, especially in Barcelona, while his English commission house acquired a contract from the Farmers-General of France to buy for them tobacco, which was imported via Glasgow from North America. This was a volatile arrangement, with allegations of intrigue and price manipulation on all sides. In 1775 the French made a sly contract with a different intermediary, and Herries failed to negotiate an equally sly private deal with their leader. His reputation was already suffering: Joshua Johnson, a London merchant, referred to Herries &amp; Co. in 1774 as &#145;damned rascals&#146;  (Price, 141). Sharp practice was too much for Forbes and Hunter, who resigned from Herries's commission house, as well as from the bank. In most affairs Herries can be accused of acting without scruple and too independently of his colleagues.<br>
<br>By 1793 Herries was married to Catherine Foote (1762&#150;1808) of Charlton Place, Bishopsbourne, Kent; she was some thirty years his junior but predeceased him. They had no children. In 1793 Captain Edward James Foote, Catherine's brother, married Nina, whom Herries described in his will as &#145;my natural daughter by Martha Scott&#146;. Foote divorced Nina in 1803 and remarried immediately; Herries took virtual custody of Caroline Foote, one of his three grandchildren. In 1798 Herries retired from his bank (which then became known as Herries, Farquhar &amp; Co.) but not from wider business. He bought a small estate at Cheltenham, where he died in February 1815, some &pound;340 in debt to his old firm. He also owed &pound;400 to Forbes, whose friendship he had never forfeited. An untypically sensitive request was that his executor (Foote, by then a rear-admiral) should send Forbes two hampers, each of four dozen bottles of cider and perry, as there was no money in the estate to repay him. The bank, still at 16 St James's Street, was absorbed by Lloyds Bank in 1893.<br>
