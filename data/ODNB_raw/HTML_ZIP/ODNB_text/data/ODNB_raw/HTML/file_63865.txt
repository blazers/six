<span class="headword">Gray,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1693?, <em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">seedsman</span>, may have been the Samuel Gray baptized on 28 January 1693 at St Giles Cripplegate, London, but A. E. Gunther, in <span class="italic">A Century of Zoology at the British Museum</span> gives his birth date as 1694. Very little is known of Gray's life other than his success in running the family-owned seed business at the Black Boy in Pall Mall, London. He inherited the company from his father, also Samuel Gray, but seems to have been the more active in developing business. He bought a garden at Tettlefields, Westminster, and lived there, bequeathing it in turn to his eldest son, along with the Black Boy premises and business concerns, at his death in 1766. The house at Tettlefields was pulled down in 1828 when Carlton House was built. The company traded extensively with the Netherlands and at some point Gray expanded his interests to include a mill on the River Ravensbourne, near Deptford, later called Armoury Mill, where he introduced the commercial novelty of ground mustard (mustard flour). Before then, mustard seeds were crushed with a pestle and mortar. His firm subsequently achieved something of a mustard monopoly. The mill also produced cut glass for domestic and decorative use.<br>
<br>On 6 December 1730 at Aspeden, Hertfordshire, Gray married Juliana Kelly, who outlived him, dying in 1774. Their first child was Juliana (1734&#150;1811), who remained unmarried, then came Samuel and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11333/', "Edward Whitaker Gray")</script>, both of whom became distinguished naturalists. <a name="cosubject_63866"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Gray</span>  (1739&#150;1771), <span class="occ">seedsman and botanical writer</span>, worked in the family firm and carried on the business after his father's death. In 1760 he translated parts of Linnaeus's <span class="italic">Philosophica botanica</span>, which was published as <span class="italic">An Introduction to Botany</span> under James Lee's name. On 7 May 1761 at St James, Westminster, he married Frances Wade (1738&#150;1801), whose father was a picture dealer in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden. The couple had four children in quick succession, only one of whom survived, a sickly boy called <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11353/', "Samuel Frederick Gray (1766&#150;1828)")</script>. Samuel Gray died unexpectedly in 1771, leaving all the family property to his younger brother, who afterwards became keeper of natural curiosities at the British Museum at Montague House from 1787. Gray's wife, Frances, was consequently left with very little money on which to bring up their son.<br>
