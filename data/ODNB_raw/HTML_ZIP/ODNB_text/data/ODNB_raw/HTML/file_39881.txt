<span class="headword">Hall,  Robert Lowe</span>, Baron Roberthall  (1901&#150;1988), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 6 March 1901 in Tenterfield, New South Wales, Australia, the second of the three sons (the eldest of whom was killed in action in 1917 in the First World War) and third of the five children of Edgar Hall, lecturer at the University of Sydney and later a mining engineer, who had emigrated to Australia, and his wife, Rose Helen, daughter of Archibald Kennedy Cullen, of Undercliffe Station, New South Wales. His parents moved to Silverspur in Queensland when he was a baby and, after attending the local school there, he won a state scholarship to the grammar school in Ipswich, near Brisbane. He studied civil engineering at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, graduating BEng in 1922 and going the following year to Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Rhodes scholar. He obtained first-class honours in philosophy, politics, and economics (1926) and was appointed to a college lectureship at Trinity College, Oxford. He was a fellow of Trinity from 1927 to 1950 and of Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1938 to 1947 (visiting fellow in 1961&#150;4).<br>
<br>In the 1930s Hall became a prominent member of the Economists' Research Group, joining some younger Oxford dons who were sceptical of current economic doctrine, and undertook empirical research on how business actually behaved&#151;for example, in fixing prices or reacting to price signals. His contribution to this research included an article in 1939, &#145;Price theory and business behaviour&#146;, written in collaboration with the American Charles J. Hitch, which first introduced the idea of the kinked demand curve. (The article was reprinted in <span class="italic">Oxford Studies in the Price Mechanism</span>, 1951, edited by Thomas Wilson and Philip Andrews.)<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Hall joined the Ministry of Supply (raw materials department) and, after America's entry into the war, served for two years in 1942&#150;4 with the British raw materials mission in Washington, DC. In 1947 he succeeded James Meade as director of the economic section of the Cabinet Office, having meanwhile divided his time between Oxford and the Board of Trade, and continued as director for nearly fourteen years until April 1961. He was in charge of the only substantial group of professional economists in Whitehall, and although he was not given the title of economic adviser to the government until 1953, when he moved to the Treasury, that accurately describes his role. He retained this post until 1961, serving under eight chancellors of the exchequer and exercising more influence on economic policy than any other official. Among the matters in which he took a prominent part were the devaluation of 1949, rearmament in 1950&#150;51, the Robot proposal to float the pound in 1952, the introduction of the investment allowance in 1953, the credit squeeze which began in 1955, and the Treasury's evidence to the committee of 1957&#150;9 chaired by Cyril Radcliffe. During his years in the economic section he kept a diary, contrary to the rules; it provides both a picture of the writer and a unique insight into the way in which economic policy took shape in the post-war years.<br>
<br>On leaving the Treasury, Hall returned to Oxford and in 1964 was elected principal of Hertford College, spending much of his three years there as a member of the commission of inquiry into Oxford University (1964&#150;6), chaired by Baron Franks. He continued to maintain contact with Whitehall, for a short time as an adviser to the Ministry of Transport, and for six years as a member of the Commonwealth Economic Committee (1961&#150;7). He also accepted two business appointments, one as an advisory director of Unilever (1961&#150;71), and the second, at the invitation of Baron Plowden, as adviser to Tube Investments (1961&#150;76). He took an active interest in the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, whose role as economic commentators and forecasters he had earlier done much to encourage, and served as chairman of the executive committee from 1962 to 1970.<br>
<br>In 1969 Hall was made a life baron and changed his name by deed poll to become Lord Roberthall. For the next two decades he was an active member of the House of Lords, latterly as a member of the Social Democratic Party. He spoke in debates and served on many standing committees, taking the chair of a select committee on commodity prices in 1976&#150;7. He received many honours. Appointed CB in 1950 and KCMG in 1954, he was an honorary fellow of both Trinity College (1958) and Hertford College (1969), Oxford, and was created an honorary DSc at the University of Queensland. He was president of the Royal Economic Society in 1958&#150;60 and of the Society of Business Economists from 1968 to 1973. Earlier he had been chairman of an international group of experts at the Organization of European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) which was the forerunner of working party 3 of the OECD. He delivered the Sidney Ball lecture in Oxford in 1954 and the Rede lecture in Cambridge in 1962 (&#145;Planning&#146;, 1962).<br>
<br>Hall was not at his best as a theoretician and published relatively little: several articles and two books, of which the more substantial is <span class="italic">The Economic System in a Social State</span> (1937), based on lectures delivered in 1934. As is clear from his diaries, his gifts were those of a highly successful economic adviser. He had a remarkable feel for the state of the economy and could outdo his staff as a forecaster. He was outstanding as a draftsman, but a man of few words in committee. He was a realist, endowed with great common sense, appreciating the limits of what was feasible, and a good judge of men. He took great pains over recruitment of staff and initiated a scheme for borrowing economists from their universities for a two-year spell. His unaffected modesty, good humour, and thoughtfulness won him the affection, as his abilities won the respect, of his colleagues.<br>
<br>Hall married twice. His first marriage in 1932 was to (Laura) Margaret Linfoot (<i>d</i>. 1995), daughter of George Edward Linfoot, musician, of Nottingham. She became a well-known economist in her own right and a fellow of Somerville College, Oxford. They had two daughters. When the marriage was dissolved in 1968 he married Perilla Thyme, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36201/', "Sir Richard Vynne Southwell")</script>, aeronautical engineer, and the former wife of Patrick Horace Nowell-Smith, philosopher and fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. The two spent much of the next twenty years in their house, Quarry, Trenance, near Newquay in north Cornwall. Hall was a passionate gardener, working on his Oxford allotment at weekends even when in the Treasury and winning prizes with his sweetcorn from the Treasury Horticultural Society. After a stroke in 1987 Lord Roberthall never fully recovered; he died by his Cornwall garden next to the sea at Quarry on 17 September 1988. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
