<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robertson,  Fyfe <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>James]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1987), <span class="occ">journalist and broadcaster</span>, was born on 19 August 1902 at 35 Shandon Crescent, Edinburgh, one of the six children of James Robertson, a miner who became a United Free Church of Scotland minister, and his wife, Jane Dunlop. He was born James Robertson but later adopted the forename Fyfe. He grew up in poverty in Glasgow, and was educated at Glasgow High School for Boys before studying medicine at Glasgow University. He met his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Smith (1905&#150;1973) when he was eighteen and she was fifteen. They married in 1928, and had two daughters: one, Elizabeth, became a singer and married the tenor Richard Lewis. After giving up medicine Robertson went into journalism, working for Scottish newspapers including the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, before moving to London to work for the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, and the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>.<br>
<br>In 1943 Robertson joined <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> as picture editor, and became a feature writer. He was a serious investigative journalist, campaigning for better medicine, healthier and organic farming, and his most famous article, &#145;We investigate the groundnut scandal&#146;, appeared in November 1949. This followed a three-week trip to Tanganyika, where the British government had invested millions since 1947 in an attempt to clear 5000 square miles of bush and devote it to the mechanical cultivation of peanuts, in order to alleviate the post-war shortage of oils and fats in Britain. In the article he exposed the lack of planning, the failure of the expensive and unsuitable machinery brought from England, and the lack of proper accounting, calling it &#145;a shocking case of top-level tomfoolery almost wrecking a worthwhile job&#146;  (<span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, 19 Nov 1949). The article was referred to in the debate on the scheme in parliament on 21 November 1949, and by helping to turn the failure of the scheme into a political issue it may have hastened the fall of the Attlee government. Robertson thought that his best work was done in <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>.<br>
<br>When <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> stopped publication in 1957, Fyfe Robertson, by now assistant editor, was one of several of its best writers and photographers to move to the new BBC television programme <span class="italic">Tonight</span>, a current-affairs programme presented five nights a week from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. It was intended for people who might be coming and going, and might switch on at any time, and was conceived as a continuous programme of short items, held together by a permanent staff of comp&egrave;res, interviewers, and reporters. It presented a mixture of film reports and studio interviews, and ranged from the serious to the merely bizarre. A completely new approach to current-affairs broadcasting, it was produced by Donald Baverstock and Alasdair Milne. Comp&egrave;red by Cliff Michelmore, <span class="italic">Tonight</span> ran until 1965. Described by Alasdair Milne as a television natural, Fyfe Robertson did his first film report in May 1957. With his Scottish accent, his slow, over-emphatic voice, his deerstalker hat, and his goatee beard, he soon became one of the programme's most popular reporters. Under long-term contract to the BBC from 1959 to produce reports for <span class="italic">Tonight</span>, he often made as many as twelve film reports a month. Although many of his stories were funny, ranging from &#145;Inchaquin Bachelors&#146; (about an Irish island populated entirely by shy bachelors), &#145;Deckchairs&#146; (in which he discovered the man who claimed to fold up deckchairs faster than anyone else in the country), to his favourite, &#145;The great pie of Denby Dale&#146; (a village pie that had to be made bigger every year, contained whole sheep and cows, and took thirty-six hours to cook), he also covered serious topical subjects. He made his first foreign trip for <span class="italic">Tonight</span> in 1960, when he made nine reports in central Africa, and after this he made many trips with a camera crew to places such as Israel, Cyprus, the Caribbean, and the United States. He made longer documentaries, too, including <span class="italic">Old Man of the Mountains</span>, filmed in California in 1963, six programmes on museums in 1964, and <span class="italic">Will Shakespeare&#151;Gent</span>, also in 1964.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Tonight</span> was succeeded by <span class="italic">Twenty-Four Hours</span>, a late-night current-affairs programme, in 1965. Robertson joined its reporting team, and continued to make documentary reports on topics such as children in mental hospitals and gang warfare in Glasgow, and he visited Russia in 1967 for the programme. He was also making longer films, including a special fifty-minute report on Aberfan and its aftermath, <span class="italic">What Happened to Pity?</span>, in 1966, and <span class="italic">Animal Dealers</span>, three programmes on the use of animals for medical research, the pet trade, and zoos, in 1968. For <span class="italic">Collector's World</span> he interviewed a collector of door knockers, and a collector of razor blades. He also began to contribute to the new current-affairs programme, <span class="italic">Nationwide</span>, in 1969.<br>
<br>Although no longer under long-term contract to the BBC, Fyfe Robertson continued to make documentaries in the 1970s, including a series of films commemorating the 300th anniversary of the Greenwich Royal Observatory (1975). In <span class="italic">Around the World in 80 Hours</span> (1976) he flew round the world in Concorde. In 1975 he presented his first full-length weekly series of his own, <span class="italic">Robbie</span>, in which he looked back over the changes in human experience during his lifetime, and aired some of his prejudices, as in a programme about modern art, when he described the 1977 Hayward Gallery exhibition of contemporary art as &#145;phony art&#146; or &#145;phart&#146;. There were three series altogether, ending in 1977.<br>
<br>Robertson remarried in 1978. His second wife was Vera, a singer, widow of Harold Ford, a Methodist minister. After this he made only a few more television appearances; his last documentary was <span class="italic">The World of Peat</span> in 1981. He wrote one book, a travel guide, <span class="italic">Visit California with Fyfe Robertson</span> (1981). Although he had socialist sympathies, he prided himself on never having voted. An atheist, despite his upbringing, he described himself as a humanist radical.<br>
<br>Fyfe Robertson suffered a heart attack after appearing in a special Christmas edition of <span class="italic">This is your Life</span> in 1986, when the subject was Cliff Michelmore. He died on 4 February 1987 in a nursing home in Eastbourne, Sussex.<br>
