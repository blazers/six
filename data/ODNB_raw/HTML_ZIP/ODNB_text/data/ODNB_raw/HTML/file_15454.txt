<span class="headword">Ker,  (John) Bellenden</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>John Bellenden Gawler]</span>  (1764&#150;1842), <span class="occ">botanist and man of fashion</span>, was born John Bellenden Gawler on 10 May 1764, the eldest son of John Gawler (<i>d</i>. 1803) of Ramridge, near Andover, Hampshire, and Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1802), eldest surviving daughter of John Bellenden, third Lord Bellenden (<i>d</i>. 1740). He was baptized on 5 June 1764 at the Temple Church, London. On 5 November 1804 George III, out of regard for Gawler's mother, and at the instance of his second cousin, William Bellenden Ker, seventh Lord Bellenden and fourth duke of Roxburghe, granted him a licence to take the name of Ker Bellenden in lieu of Gawler; he was, however, invariably known as Bellenden Ker. William, fourth duke of Roxburghe, died in 1805 without direct heir. During his lifetime he endeavoured to divert the succession in favour of Ker, and entailed his estates upon him, but both the entail and Ker's claim to the title were ultimately set aside by the House of Lords in favour of James Innes-Ker, fifth duke of Roxburghe, on 11 May 1812.<br>
<br>Bellenden Ker was long known as a wit and man of fashion in London. Many stories were told of the charm of his conversation, and he was the hero of some &#145;affairs of gallantry&#146;. In May 1796 George Annesley, Viscount Valentia, obtained &pound;2000 damages against him in the court of king's bench for committing adultery with Annesley's wife, Anne, Lady Valentia. At an early age he obtained a commission in the 2nd regiment of Life Guards; he was appointed captain on 20 January 1790, and was senior captain in the regiment in 1793, when he was compelled to quit the army owing to his displays of sympathy with the French revolution. His attention must, however, have turned to botany, for in 1801 he brought out, anonymously, his <span class="italic">Recensio plantarum</span>, a review of all the plants illustrated up to that time in Henry C. Andrews's <span class="italic">Botanist's Repository</span>. About the same date he began to contribute occasional descriptions of new plants to Samuel Curtis's <span class="italic">Botanical Magazine</span>, then under the editorship of John Sims, who highly commended Ker in the preface to the fifteenth volume. In 1804 Ker printed an important memoir on a group of plants, the Iridaceae, in <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span>. In 1812 the <span class="italic">Botanical Register</span> was started in opposition to the <span class="italic">Botanical Magazine</span> and Ker became the first editor. He held the office until about 1823, when John Lindley took sole control. When freed from botanical journalism, Ker revised his memoir on the Iridaceae of 1804, and brought out <span class="italic">Iridearum genera</span>, which was published in Brussels in 1828 and was his last important work on botany. On resuming work after a period of illness, he busied himself on <span class="italic">An Essay on the Archaeology of Popular English Phrases and Nursery Rhymes</span>, which was first published in 1834. He also wrote a number of occasional articles in various gardening papers.<br>
<br>During the later period of his life Ker lived at Ramridge, where he died on 11 June 1842. The genus <i>Bellendena</i> commemorates him. With his wife, Ann, who survived him, he had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15447/', "Charles Henry Bellenden Ker")</script>.<br>
