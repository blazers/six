<span class="headword">Leigh <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brown]</span>,  Mary <span class="st"> [Marie]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em>1885, <em>d.</em> in or after 1965), <span class="occ">militant suffragette</span>, was born in Manchester and was a schoolteacher until her marriage to a builder named Leigh. More details of her family have proved impossible to trace, because of the ubiquity of her name. From 1906 until 1913 Mary Leigh was a member of the most militant of the women's suffrage organizations, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Mary Leigh was herself one of the first to engage in the acts of violent and escalating militancy which marked the later phases of the WSPU's campaigns, for which she was to be imprisoned on more than nine occasions.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1908, following Prime Minister Asquith's refusal to meet a WSPU delegation, Mary Leigh and Edith New smashed the windows of 10 Downing Street. They were arrested and sentenced to two months' imprisonment. When they were released on 23 August, they were greeted by a brass band and accorded a ceremonial welcome breakfast attended by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst. Mary Leigh immediately resumed her campaigning, acting as drum-major of the WSPU drum and fife band, which often accompanied their processions and demonstrations. Then on 17 September 1909 Mary Leigh conducted a rooftop protest at Bingley Hall, Birmingham, where Asquith was addressing a meeting from which all women had been excluded. Using an axe, she and Charlotte Marsh tore slates from the roof and threw them at the police below, causing some injuries, and at Asquith's car. For this Leigh was sentenced to three months' hard labour for assault, and one month for damage to property. On arriving at Winson Green gaol in Birmingham, she broke the window in her cell in protest, demanding to be treated as a political offender. She embarked on a hunger strike (a tactic which had previously secured the release of suffragettes on grounds of ill health), and became one of the first suffragettes to be forcibly fed. Her graphic account of the horrors of forcible feeding was published while she was still in prison. The WSPU was incensed, and initiated legal proceedings against the home secretary, prison governor, and prison doctor on Mary Leigh's behalf, opening a defence fund in her name. The case was brought to trial in December 1909, and the jury found for the defence, upholding the defence's claim that forcible feeding had been necessary to preserve life and that minimum force had been used.<br>
<br>During 1910 Mary Leigh was involved in by-election work in Wales, and on 18 November (&#145;black Friday&#146;) was among the many women injured in violent scuffles with the police near the houses of parliament following the dropping of the <span class="roman">Conciliation Bill</span>. On 21 November 1911 she was again arrested, following the organized window-breaking campaign which accompanied another deputation to the House of Commons, and was sentenced to two months' hard labour for assaulting a policeman (she claimed it was in self-defence). On 18 July 1912 she was in Dublin, where she threw a hatchet into Asquith's carriage; later that evening she and Gladys Evans went to the Theatre Royal, Dublin, where Asquith had recently seen a performance, and set fire to the curtains, threw a burning chair into the orchestra pit, and set off several small bombs. Mary Leigh conducted her own defence at her trial on 6 August, and her speech was reported as the focal point of the proceedings. She was convicted, and sentenced to five years' penal servitude. The sentence was condemned by the WSPU, and tributes to Mary Leigh's courage filled the pages of its newspaper, <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>; Christabel Pankhurst, however, later denied that Leigh and Evans's actions had been specifically sanctioned in advance by the organization. Mary Leigh undertook a hunger strike of six weeks, which left her in an emaciated condition, and she was released on licence. (The case was eventually dropped after prolonged litigation about the terms of the licence.)<br>
<br>Following the events in Dublin, Mary Leigh became disillusioned with the WSPU, which she felt had not responded adequately to her lengthy prison sentence. Consequently she involved herself increasingly with Sylvia Pankhurst's breakaway suffrage organization, the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELF). In October 1913 she was badly injured during scuffles with the police at an ELF meeting at Bow Baths. She continued to work with the ELF long after the WSPU's campaign ceased in 1914. During the war years she applied for war service, but was rejected because of her criminal record. Reverting to her maiden name, Brown, she gained a place on an RAC course to train as an ambulance driver. Little is known of Mary Leigh's life after this time. She apparently took part in the first Aldermaston march (1958), and as a committed socialist regularly attended the May day processions in Hyde Park. She was a founder of the Emily Wilding Davison lodge, a memorial to her suffrage comrade who died after throwing herself under the hooves of the king's horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby. Every year Mary Leigh made the pilgrimage to Morpeth, Northumberland, to tend Davison's grave. In later years she continued to recall with pride her days in the WSPU, and stood by her actions as a suffragette. Mary Leigh gave two interviews in 1965; nothing is known of her after this.<br>
