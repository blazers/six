<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Adamson,  William <span class="st"> [Willie]</span></span>  (1863&#150;1936), <span class="occ">politician and trade unionist</span>, was born at Halbeath, near Dunfermline in Fife, on 2 April 1863, the son of James Armstrong Adamson, a coalminer, and Flora Cunningham. He attended a dame-school run by the wife of a mining engineer, and left at the age of eleven to work in the mining industry, where he was employed for the next twenty-seven years. He married, on 25 February 1887, Christine Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1935), a winder in a damask factory, with whom he had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The 1870s were a decade of vigorous trade-union activity in the Scottish coalfields, but, with the exception of Fife, union organization proved brittle. The Fife and Kinross Miners' Association survived some difficult periods, not least because the coal owners, sensitive to the pressures of the export trade, preferred negotiation to conflict. Adamson first became active in the union as a branch delegate; he became vice-president in 1894, assistant secretary in 1902, and general secretary, the senior post, in 1908. Through amalgamation his organization became in 1917 the Fife, Kinross, and Clackmannanshire Miners' Association. Moreover from the 1890s mining trade unionism became more effective in other Scottish coalfields. The various unions came together in 1894 to form the Scottish Miners' Federation&#151;the National Union of Scottish Mineworkers from 1914&#151;and this body in turn affiliated to the Miners' Federation of Great Britain.<br>
<br>Adamson was in many respects typical of the leaders who dominated British and Scottish miners' conferences before 1914. He was an active Baptist, a total abstainer, an admirer of Robert Burns, and, as a young man, involved in a mutual improvement society. His acquisition of the skills appropriate for a respectable miners' official went along with a conciliatory attitude to industrial relations. Politically Adamson was initially a Liberal, but the prominence of the Fife union had led by the late 1880s to demands that the West Fife constituency have a miners' representative. The reluctance of local Liberals and the emergence of independent Labour organization led in January 1910 to a three-cornered contest with Adamson, who had been a Labour member of Dunfermline council since 1905, standing as a Labour candidate. Unsuccessful in his first attempt, he defeated the Liberal in a straight fight in December 1910 to become the first Scottish miners' Labour MP. He was helped by the relative absence of ethnic and religious divisions among Fife miners, compared with the situation in Lanarkshire.<br>
<br>Adamson's electoral success was founded on modest claims for the Labour Party. &#145;The Labour Party was the workers' own party&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dunfermline Press</span>, 3 Dec 1910), but he also emphasized that the pre-war Labour Party was not a socialist party. He was a strong supporter of Britain's involvement in the First World War (his elder son was killed in the conflict) although he was at first unhappy about military conscription and voted against the second reading of the <span class="roman">Military Service Bill</span> in January 1916. The involvement of key Labour figures in the Lloyd George coalition and the marginalization of critics of the government combined to elevate Adamson to the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Labour Party, in succession to Arthur Henderson, in October 1917. He retained the post until 1921 when he was replaced by J. R. Clynes. He was appointed a privy councillor in 1918. His experience as effectively party leader in the Commons was unhappy. Many felt that he lacked the necessary qualities. &#145;He has neither wit, fervour nor intellect; he is most decidedly not a leader, not even like Henderson, a manager of men&#146; was Beatrice Webb's characteristically acerbic judgment  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 330, 14 Jan 1919). Yet the weakness of the parliamentary party after 1918 was not simply the consequence of its leader's limitations. Comprising only a small contingent of MPs, mostly trade unionists, it seemed ill-equipped to cope with the challenges of post-war politics. Adamson's style reflected the pre-war party's status as a pressure group, but with an expanded electorate and a divided Liberal Party, Labour's ambitions had been transformed.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1920s Adamson remained a senior figure within the Parliamentary Labour Party. He headed the Scottish Office in both the 1924 and the 1929 governments. On the second occasion, Ramsay MacDonald proposed that Adamson move to the Lords, leaving the junior minister, Tom Johnston, to answer for the Scottish Office in the Commons. The plan was abandoned when MacDonald discovered that Adamson had a son; the premier was opposed to appointing peers with heirs. Nevertheless Johnston often functioned as the effective secretary of state with Adamson as ceremonial head  (Johnston, 100&#150;102). This arrangement could give sustenance to the claim that Adamson's ministerial appointments simply reflected his place in the Labour Party hierarchy. &#145;There are so many considerations which have nothing to do with merit. The Labour Party has its &#147;Dukes&#148;&#151;in its 18th century meaning of the term&#151;the great trade unions have to be represented&#151;viz Adamson!&#146;  (Beatrice Webb to Arthur Ponsonby, undated, Ponsonby papers, 671). Yet such representation in a Labour cabinet made an impact in the crisis of August 1931: Adamson voted with the minority who opposed any cut in unemployment benefit. Tom Johnston recalled Adamson's response to the proposed reduction. &#145;I've never voted against the poor yet, and I can't now&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Diary of Hugh Dalton</span>, 198&#150;9, 15 March 1936).<br>
<br>From this perspective Adamson's political career culminated in a principled stand. Whatever his caution and flexibility he revealed himself to be a stalwart defender of the labour interest in the face of orthodox financial pressures. Yet alongside his political seniority, Adamson's post-war trade union position became increasingly beleaguered, and this carried political consequences. During the First World War, a critical left-wing current had developed within the Fife miners' union. These radicals emphasized Adamson's responsiveness to coal owners' demands, the implications of mechanization for skilled colliers, and the lack of democracy within the union. Following the miners' defeat in the 1921 lock-out, criticism focused on the democracy issue. The culmination was a split at the end of 1922 with the formation of a separate Reform Union among the Fife miners under Philip Hodge of the Independent Labour Party.<br>
<br>When a general election was called late in 1923, the Reform Union decided to run Hodge as a parliamentary candidate against Adamson in the West Fife constituency. Hodge had tried to secure the official Labour nomination, but having failed ran as a Reform candidate. In a straight fight he polled 6459 votes (over 34 per cent), an indication of many miners' disillusion with Adamson. The enmities meant that reunification of the two unions was achieved only in 1927. Several influential members of the Fife left were now in the Communist Party and that body favoured reunion. The lengthy dispute of 1926 placed a premium on solidarity, but the reunited union had to deal with the consequences of a thorough defeat. Reunification meant new elections both for posts in Fife and for the coalfield's representatives on the Scottish executive. The left made a significant advance and Adamson and his allies endeavoured by creative use of the rule book to evade the consequences. Mining unionism in Fife, and Lanarkshire, descended into chaos. The Fife county board suspended Adamson as secretary on the ground that he had broken his mandate, whereupon he resigned and set up a new union, the Fife, Clackmannan, and Kinross Miners' Union. Significantly this new body became the official Fife union within the National Union of Scottish Mineworkers and therefore within the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. The lack of constitutional procedure involved in creating the new union counted for little against a broad agreement among miners' union officials that communist growth must be blocked at all costs. The shambles was intensified as communists moved towards their sectarian &#145;class against class&#146; policy, which produced yet another union, the United Mineworkers of Scotland. Yet to radicals in Fife, a separate &#145;red&#146; miners' union could seem the only credible response to Adamson's contempt for union decisions.<br>
<br>The imbroglio damaged the veteran leader's position in West Fife. In the 1929 election the Communist candidate, Willie Gallacher, polled over 6000 votes, and two years later he increased this to nearly 7000. Gallacher's intervention effectively cost Adamson his seat in 1931: the Conservative margin of victory was under 2000. Much worse faced him when he contested the seat again in November 1935. Several villages were now communist strongholds. A twelve-week dispute at the Valleyfield colliery saw members of Adamson's union ignoring his pleas to return to work; instead his members co-operated with the &#145;red&#146; United Mineworkers of Scotland. The issue intensified long-standing criticism about his industrial policy. Recently widowed and ageing, he was no match for Gallacher and the Fife communists. He was defeated by 593 votes and died soon afterwards in a nursing home near Dunfermline on 23 February 1936.<br>
<br>Adamson's reputation was damaged by the divisions within Fife mining unionism in the 1920s. Most accounts of him have been provided by left critics and have emphasized his autocracy and caution. In several respects he was characteristic of a generation of miners' leaders, but his world in Fife disintegrated and he faced talented opponents. A more nuanced portrait was offered by Tom Johnston:<blockquote>he was the soul of loyalty and good comradeship &hellip; caution personified with a capital P; he carried on for years a relentless warfare with the communists in his county, and his motto in that warfare as I once told him was the Covenanters' banner at Tippermuir &#145;Jesus and No Quarter&#146;. (<span class="italic">Memories</span>, 101)</blockquote>
