<span class="headword">Moss,  Harry Neville</span>  (1895&#150;1982), <span class="occ">draper</span>, was born at 10 The Triangle, Kensington, London, on 25 October 1895, the younger son of George Frederic Moss (1855&#150;1906), master tailor, and his wife, Lucie Phoebe Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Campbell. His grandfather, Moses Moss, a bespoke tailor and dealer in secondhand clothes, had opened a shop in Covent Garden, London, in 1860. Moses set up George, the eldest of his five sons, and Alfred (1862&#150;1937) in another shop nearby in 1881, with George responsible for tailoring, and Alfred in overall charge of the business, including the purchase of high-quality secondhand clothing for resale. Both of George's sons joined the business. During the First World War, Harry was commissioned and served at Salonika; the elder brother was killed. His uncle Alfred married late in life.<br>
<br>Before the First World War the firm was winning a reputation as military outfitters, well able to handle the idiosyncratic variations of regimental uniform. A branch was set up in Camberley for Sandhurst officer cadets, and during the war the firm was able to produce high-quality ready-to-wear uniforms at short notice. After the war the firm retained many of its wartime customers and added formal diplomatic and court wear to its range of full-dress military uniforms. In another area the business changed its emphasis from the sale of secondhand and misfit clothing to the hire of morning and evening dress; it continued to make high-quality, hand-finished ready-to-wear suits, which were cheaper than, but hardly distinguishable from, bespoke tailor-made suits.<br>
<br>On 15 June 1920 Moss married Sophia Ida Woolf (1901&#150;1971) at the West London Synagogue in Marylebone. On his return to the firm after the war, Harry Moss gained his uncle's confidence and was made a director in 1921. He gradually brought change into the traditional business, introducing mechanization for routine tailoring processes, while retaining hand-finishing. He rationalized office methods, making card indexes of customers, and&#151;with considerable misgivings&#151;introduced discreet, humorous direct-mail advertising for existing customers. This proved to be a much-appreciated innovation. The premises were largely rebuilt in 1929, but most activities, including tailoring and the care of dress wear for hire, were still carried out under the same roof. In 1934 Moss took over as managing director, a position he was to hold for forty years. At that time around a hundred staff were employed, and turnover was over &pound;220,000 per year.<br>
<br>Following the Second World War, the business changed in several ways. The range of clothing was extended to include women's wear, including wedding and evening dresses, both for sale and hire. New branches were opened; there were thirty-two in 1971, including two in Paris. The firm aimed to attract young customers as well as a more established clientele. It began to advertise extensively, ironically having to emphasize that the firm actually sold clothes as well as hiring them, such had been its reputation for hiring. Annual turnover in 1971 was &pound;3.5 million and the staff numbered 1350. The company, a private limited company since 1914, was converted into a public company in 1947, but the majority of shares still remained under family control. When Harry Moss died in 1982 there were six Mosses in the business.<br>
<br>Moss was committed to ensuring the preservation of his family firm's high reputation, and care for customers and staff alike. He was a respected figure in the menswear trade. Outside his work he devoted much time to the West London Synagogue, and rarely missed the Friday evening service. He enjoyed cricket&#151;he was a redoubtable left-handed opening bat&#151;and golf. He encouraged his firm to sponsor and attend sporting events such as show-jumping, skiing, and golf tournaments. He served as treasurer and governor of an approved school near his home in Surrey, and was president of the Master Tailors' Benevolent Association, and joint president of the Boys' Club Movement. Moss died in Middlesex Hospital, Westminster, on 11 May 1982, survived by a daughter and his son Monty, who had succeeded him as chairman.<br>
