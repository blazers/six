<span class="headword">Gay,  Maisie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Daisy Maude Noble]</span>  (1878&#150;1945), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was born on 7 January 1878 at 27 Alexandra Road, Willesden, London, the eldest daughter in the family of at least two daughters and one son of Peter Noble (<i>b</i>. 1844/5), wine merchant's clerk, commercial traveller, and later licensed victualler, and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pratt (<i>b</i>. 1852/3). She was educated in Germany and at the North London Collegiate School for Girls. By 1901 she was married to Arthur Wells (<i>b</i>. 1860/61), a foreign dealer, though her husband is not mentioned in accounts of her, and she came to use the surname Munro-Noble in addition to her stage name of Maisie Gay. A chance conversation with a chorus girl on a bus made her enthusiastic about a theatrical career, and she made her first stage appearance, in the chorus of <span class="italic">The Cherry Girl</span> by Seymour Hicks, in Blackpool in November 1903. The following year she joined the company of theatre manager George Edwardes on tour in J. T. Tanner's musical play <span class="italic">A Country Girl</span>, later playing the leading part of Nan over 1000 times between 1904 and 1907. She toured in other Edwardes productions as well as those of the company of playwright and theatre manager George Dance. In April 1908 Gay made her d&eacute;but in the West End at the Hicks Theatre as Fifi in <span class="italic">A Waltz King</span>, followed by Clementine in George Grossmith's <span class="italic">The Girls of Gottenberg</span>. The latter led to her being cast as Mrs Farquhar, &#145;an impecunious woman of fashion&#146;, in the hugely successful musical by J. T. Tanner, <span class="italic">Our Miss Gibbs</span>, a role she played for almost two years. This also marked her first appearance at the Gaiety Theatre which, with the Adelphi, was where she appeared most often.<br>
<br>In 1911 Gay toured as Madame Blum in Tanner's <span class="italic">The Quaker Girl</span>; she played the same part in London, then in New York and across the United States&#151;in 160 towns in 266 days. Back in London in 1913 she appeared in Tanner's musical farce <span class="italic">The Girl on the Film</span> before going again to America, appearing in <span class="italic">Phyllis</span> in Boston, as Adelaide Fontaine in <span class="italic">High Jinks</span>, by Frederick Lonsdale, touring through 1914 and 1915, and in <span class="italic">Sybil</span>, by Harry Graham, in New York. She also appeared in the 1915 American film <span class="italic">The Siren's Song</span>. In London in 1916 she followed a reprise of her role in <span class="italic">High Jinks</span> by starring in a successful series of musical comedies (<span class="italic">The Boy</span>, by Fred Thompson, <span class="italic">The Beauty Spot</span>, adapted from the French by Arthur Anderson, and <span class="italic">Soldier Boy</span>, by Rida Johnson Young) and, especially, revues. Her revue d&eacute;but was in 1919 in <span class="italic">The Whirligig</span>, by Albert de Courville, followed by his <span class="italic">Pins and Needles</span> in 1921 (reprised in New York the following year). Next came <span class="italic">A to Z</span>, by Dion Titheradge and <span class="italic">Snap</span>, by Ronald Jeans and Titheradge, both in 1922 (introducing the song &#145;March with Me&#146; in the former, and touring the provinces with the latter). She also appeared in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">London Calling!</span> in 1923, <span class="italic">Charlot's Revue of 1924</span> and <span class="italic">Charlot's Revue of 1925</span>, both by R. Jeans, and Coward's <span class="italic">This Year of Grace!</span> in 1928. In 1929 Gay appeared in the last named in Melbourne and toured major cities in Australia. The following year she was in <span class="italic">Cochran's 1930 Revue</span>, by Beverley Nichols. Cochran later wrote in tribute that &#145;in her particular genre Maisie Gay was unique and irreplaceable&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Later musical comedies included <span class="italic">Better Days</span> in 1925, <span class="italic">Wildflower</span> in 1926, and <span class="italic">White Birds</span> and <span class="italic">Peggy-Ann</span>, both in 1927.<br>
<br>In December 1930, at the Winter Garden, Gay succeeded Sophie Tucker as Georgia Madison in <span class="italic">Follow a Star</span>. Also that year she made her first sound film, <span class="italic">To Oblige a Lady</span>, written by Edgar Wallace from his play, in which she again sang her song from <span class="italic">London Calling!</span>, &#145;What Love Means to Girls Like Me&#146;. She then appeared as Mrs Harris, the charlady, in Wallace's play <span class="italic">The Old Man</span>, subsequently appearing in the film version in 1932. Her last appearance on the London stage was the same year at the Queen's Theatre as Bibbo in <span class="italic">Caravan</span> before ill health forced her premature retirement. She suffered from severe arthritis; at times she had had to use the downstairs dressing-room with the chorus girls instead of that upstairs for the principal because of the great difficulty she had in using stairs.<br>
<br>According to an early biographer of No&euml;l Coward, &#145;Maisie Gay was plump and her pop-eyed face as round as a full moon&#146;  (Cole Lesley, <span class="italic">The Life of No&euml;l Coward</span>, 1967, 77). Gay wrote an autobiographical volume <span class="italic">Laughing through Life</span> in 1931. Upon her retirement she had built a small house, Kingsdown, at Box in Wiltshire, a few miles north-east of Bath. However, she was practically bedridden and her activity was limited largely to reading and listening to the radio. She did, though, give a series of talks for invalids for BBC radio in 1941. Gay died, unmarried, at her home, Kingsdown, on 13 September 1945.<br>
