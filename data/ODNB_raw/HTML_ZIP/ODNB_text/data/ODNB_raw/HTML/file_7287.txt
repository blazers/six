<span class="headword">Davis, Sir  John Francis</span>, first baronet  (1795&#150;1890), <span class="occ">colonial governor and Chinese scholar</span>, born in London on 16 July 1795, was the eldest son in the family of four sons and seven daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63504/', "Samuel Davis (1760&#150;1819)")</script>, magistrate of Benares and a director of the East India Company, and his wife, Henrietta, daughter of Solomon Boileau of Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1813 Davis was appointed writer in the East India Company factory at Canton (Guangzhou), where he early showed marked linguistic and diplomatic aptitude. In consequence he was chosen to accompany Lord Amherst on his ineffectual embassy to Peking (Beijing) in 1816. On 9 April 1822 he married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1866), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Humfrays of the Bengal Engineers; they were to have one son and six daughters. He remained at the East India Company's factory at Canton, becoming its president in 1832. Two years later he was appointed joint commissioner in China with Lord Napier, acting as second superintendent of trade. Following Napier's departure and death in the autumn of 1834 Davis was appointed superintendent of trade by the British government, which was now anxious to reverse Napier's aggressive policy in favour of quiet acquiescence to Chinese prejudices. This policy, along with his Company-bred prejudices against free trade, met with little favour among the British traders in Canton, and he resigned on 21 January 1835 and returned to England.<br>
<br>Davis had already acquired a reputation as a Chinese scholar with his translations of Chinese novels, maxims, and plays (1817, 1822) and <span class="italic">The Fortunate Union</span> (1829), and his vocabulary of Chinese words found in the Canton and Macau areas (1824). Now he published <span class="italic">The Chinese: a General Description of China and its Inhabitants</span> (2 vols., 1836) and <span class="italic">Sketches of China</span> (2 vols., 1841), both of which were very well received and ran through many editions, and in 1844 <span class="italic">Vizier Ali Khan, or, The Massacre of Benares</span>, an account of the action in which his father had been involved in 1799.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1844 Davis was appointed plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade at Canton, and, on 23 February, governor and commander-in-chief of Hong Kong, which had been ceded to Britain under the 1842 treaty of Nanking (Nanjing). The central issue facing Davis was that of the British right of entry into Canton, which, despite the terms of the treaty of Nanking, had not thus far been granted. In April 1846 he agreed with the imperial commissioner, Qiying, to delay British entry into the city in exchange for an agreement not to alienate the Chushan Islands. Attacks on the British in Canton multiplied, and in April 1847 Davis retaliated by sending an armed force which captured the Bogue (Humen) ports and occupied the Canton factories. Qiying reached a rapid agreement with Davis to open Canton in two years' time and punish those who had offended the British, and conceded the right to build warehouses and churches.<br>
<br>Despite the apparent success of this venture, Davis was censured for his actions and resigned in November 1847, although he did not leave his post until the following March. Furthermore, an 1847 parliamentary select committee inquiry into British commercial relations with China, without naming Davis, succeeded in condemning his administration of Hong Kong and supporting the views of the British merchants who had consistently opposed his policies.<br>
<br>Davis, who had been created a baronet in 1845, returned to England and took up residence at Hollywood Tower, Westbury-on-Trym, Gloucestershire. On 26 November 1867 he married again; his second wife was Lucy Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1904), daughter of Thomas James Rocke, vicar of Exmouth, with whom he had a son. He continued to publish works on China, <span class="italic">China during the War and since the Peace</span> appearing in 1852 and <span class="italic">Poeseos Sinensis commentarii: on the Poetry of the Chinese</span> in 1870. Oxford University created him a DCL in 1876, and the following year he endowed a Chinese scholarship at that institution. He died at Hollywood Tower on 13 November 1890, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by the son of his second marriage.<br>
