<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowes, Sir  Jerome</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1616), <span class="occ">diplomat and glass maker</span>, was the son of Sir John Bowes, landowner, of Elford, Staffordshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Richard Huddleston of Lancashire. For a man of his prominence and considerable notoriety, Bowes is rather an elusive person. He had a sister, Elizabeth, and three brothers, Sir Edward, Sir John, and Ralph Bowes  (will, R. Bowes, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/91, fols. 368&#150;9). In 1557 and 1558 a Sir Jerome Bowes was listed together with Ralph Bowes among gentlemen who accompanied Edward Fiennes de Clinton, first earl of Lincoln, on his expedition to France. Since Bowes was knighted at Carlisle by Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex, on 28 August 1570, this means that either the earlier knighthood was conferred on a different person and namesake or that the note was made after 1570. On 12 August 1562 Bowes married Jane, daughter and coheir of Roger Rookwood of Euston, Suffolk, and widow of Christopher Calthrop of Cockthorpe, Norfolk. She predeceased him. On 14 February 1569 he was granted the wardship of his stepson, James Calthrop, heir of Christopher Calthrop, with an annuity of &pound;2 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. calculated from 11 April 1562.<br>
<br>In the early 1560s Bowes was one of Elizabeth I's household servants and in 1571 acted as surety for a disputant in a property disagreement that was to be settled in combat. The plaintiff belonged to the household of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, but Bowes was called to the proceedings after the queen's interference in the dispute. In 1577 he was &#145;banished Court for a slanderous speech of my Lord Leicester&#146;. The substance of the slander at that time is unknown but, according to Jerome Horsey, Leicester was again furious with Bowes in 1585 when he seems to have been raking up the old rumour concerning the death of the earl's wife, Amy Robsart.<br>
<br>Bowes's diplomatic career began in 1577 when he was among those who accompanied Sir Philip Sidney in his mission to Rudolph II. In the late 1570s and early 1580s he was in France taking part in the marriage negotiations between Elizabeth and Fran&ccedil;ois Valois, duke of Alen&ccedil;on. Although his precise role is unknown, he appears to have been resident in Paris for some time and assisted Sir Edward Stafford on his arrival there. In December 1582 Bowes was still in Paris, and the queen instructed Sir Henry Cobham, her resident ambassador in France, to take counsel with him as to how best to proceed in his own mission. Presumably while in France, Bowes had translated into English a book that was published in London in 1579 as <span class="italic">An apology or defence for the Christians in France which are of the evangelicall or reformed religion</span>.<br>
<br>In June 1583 Bowes was appointed Elizabeth's ambassador to Ivan IV, tsar of Russia. The apocryphal stories about this mission survived until the end of the seventeenth century and references to them can be found in a number of treatises on Russian history published in London between 1671 and 1699, as well as in Samuel Pepys's diary. In these stories Bowes appears as a valiant subject of the queen who fearlessly defended his sovereign before Ivan the Terrible. His irascibility was admired by the tempestuous Russian tsar who, after many a stormy scene, finally satisfied all the demands presented by the ambassador. Bowes himself had always insisted that the collapse of his mission was brought about by the death of Ivan. This understanding of his mission to Moscow became accepted even at the time although the Muscovy Company, on whose behalf it was undertaken, constantly accused Bowes of mishandling the negotiations. Neither he, nor the company, nor later historians were correct in their interpretation of affairs. Bowes was given the impossible task of procuring the most advantageous trading privileges for the English without giving the tsar anything in return. During the negotiations which lasted from 18 October 1583 until 17 February 1584, Bowes had fourteen audiences with Ivan and his ministers. Termed a plenipotentiary ambassador in the queen's letter, he had no power to conclude anything and was instructed to take away from the tsar even that little which had been given to him during the preceding negotiations with the Russian ambassador in London. He had to bluff his way through the negotiations, which he also sustained by that &#145;want of temperance&#146; so deplored by the company. On 14 February 1584 he was dismissed by Ivan with these words: &#145;Since you came to us with nothing, we will send you back with what you brought us.&#146; Bowes was given an official leave on 17 February by the tsar's councillors. Thus his mission was finished a month before Ivan's death on 19 March. Bowes was caught in the turmoil which took place in Moscow after the tsar's death. His relations with Ivan's councillors were extremely strained during the negotiations. Bowes's continuous accusations that they were hampering the talks brought Ivan's wrath on several of them. After the tsar's death, Bowes was placed under house arrest and stood in real fear of his life for some six weeks before he was finally allowed to depart.<br>
<br>In January 1588 Bowes was appointed to command &#145;some 50 or 60 men &hellip; all pikes and cavaliers&#146; during the expedition into Scotland led by Henry Radcliffe, fourth earl of Sussex  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.238). The encounter turned out to be more peaceful than had been anticipated. Bowes and his men met with no resistance and the armour was returned to the royal armoury in Newcastle.<br>
<br>Bowes's involvement in commercial enterprise began in 1576 when, as a royal pensioner, he was given a patent for playing cards which he shared with Sir Henry Bedingfield. According to W. H. Price, such patents were given to the household servants in lieu of salaries. Bowes was in perpetual financial trouble and endlessly petitioned for arrears to be paid to him or for a postponement of a debt repayment. In February 1592 he was given a patent for the manufacture of drinking glasses in consideration of his personal services to the crown. The patent was for twelve years, but it was renewed on 5 October 1606. The glass house was situated at Blackfriars, London. The enterprise, unprofitable even at the time of Bowes's entry into it, was further handicapped by an exclusive patent for the use of sea coal in glass making given to Sir Edward Zouch and others. In his commercial enterprise, as in his diplomatic mission to Russia, Bowes gained more notoriety than note. He was continuously involved in disputes with the farmers under his patent and other glass makers. A copy of <span class="italic">Purchas, his Pilgrims</span> (1626) belonging now to the library of the Academy of Science in St Petersburg contains a piece of doggerel on one of its margins: &#145;God made men; &amp; men made mony. God made bees; &amp; bees made hony. God made owles, &amp; apes, &amp; asses: God made Sir Jerome Bowes, &amp; S<sup>r</sup> Jerome Bowes made Glasses&#146;  (J. S. Lure, <span class="italic">An Unpublished Epigram on an English Ambassador to Russia</span>, Oxford Slavonic Papers, new ser., 5/7, 1974, 14).<br>
<br>Bowes was an MP for Lancaster in 1601 and for Reading in 1604. He probably owed his election to Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary, or to Sir John Fortescue, chancellor of the exchequer, and he was reasonably active in parliament. He was appointed to the quorum for Middlesex in 1601 and carried the canopy at the queen's funeral in 1603.<br>
<br>On 20 February 1607 (<span class="smallcap">NS</span>) a murder was committed in Bowes's house near Charing Cross, Westminster. The account of this event, attributed to Bowes, was published in 1607. A female servant of Bowes was killed by the two thieves who came to rob him of his possessions. The thieves were later apprehended in Chester, brought back to London, and eventually executed.<br>
<br>In accordance with Bowes's will, his estate was to be divided between his nephews, nieces, and a god-daughter. His main legatee was &#145;John Bowes, the sonne of my brother S<sup>r</sup> Edward Bowes knight&#146;, and the executors of his will were his nephews, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18013/', "Sir Peter Manwood")</script> and Sir Percivall Hart  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/128. sig. 105). Bowes died between 25 and 28 March 1616, when he was buried at Hackney church, Middlesex. A portrait of him was painted in the year of his embassy to Russia: it presents a very tall man of imposing appearance, probably in his mid-thirties.<br>
