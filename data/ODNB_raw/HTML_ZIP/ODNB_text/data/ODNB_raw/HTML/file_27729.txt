<span class="headword">Trevor, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1637&#150;1717), <span class="occ">judge and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the second son of John Trevor (1602&#150;<i>c</i>.1643) of Bryncunallt, Denbighshire, judge on the north Wales circuit, and his wife, Margaret, the daughter of John Jeffreys of Acton, Denbighshire. He married Jane (1643&#150;1704), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19415/', "Sir Roger Mostyn, first baronet")</script>, of Mostyn in Flintshire and widow of Sir Roger Puleston of Emral, Worthenbury in the same county. They had four sons and two daughters. The Trevor family had long held the Bryncunallt estate but with significant interests in Ireland they were never as influential in Wales as the cadet branch of the family based at Trefalun.<br>
<br>Trevor's education was given direction by his father's brother, Arthur Trevor. He attended Ruthin School as a young boy and proceeded to St Paul's School, London, in 1647. He worked as a clerk in his uncle's legal chambers until he was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1654. By May 1661 he had been called to the bar. Having acquired a basic knowledge of the &#145;knavish part of the law&#146; he became a recognized expert at handling gambling transactions  (North, 1.286). He ingratiated himself at the Stuart court and was rewarded with a knighthood on 29 January 1671. Two years later he was promoted to become one of the king's counsel. Called to the bench of the Inner Temple in May 1673, he became its treasurer later that year and was a reader by 1675. Promotion in the legal world coincided with political progress. On 10 February 1673 he became MP for Castle Rising in Norfolk. This was a pocket borough of the Howard family and Trevor purchased the seat for &pound;60.<br>
<br>Bishop Gilbert Burnet, a contemporary commentator, described Trevor as &#145;a bold and dexterous man [who] &hellip; knew the most effectual ways of recommending himself to every government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.76). During the closing years of the Cavalier Parliament (1661&#150;79) Trevor's career justified these words. He was an active debater and a clear government supporter. By the autumn of 1675 his eminence was such that he was chairing both the committee of ways and means and that on the state of the nation. He was an ardent defender of the established church and played a significant part in debates relating to the threat of Catholicism. He was elected chairman of the committee on the growth of popery in the spring of 1678 and took the lead in these inquiries. He was also a member of the committee which investigated the Popish Plot later that year, and presented the draft address to the House of Commons for the removal of all Catholics from London.<br>
<br>Committed to the hereditary succession, Trevor was a vehement opponent of exclusion. He was returned for Bere Alston in Devon in the parliaments of March and October 1679, but he gained a Welsh seat in the third Exclusion Parliament (1681) by securing Denbigh County. Trevor spent most of his time at his London residence in Clement's Lane but by this time he had inherited the Bryncunallt estate on the death of his brother and certainly made an effort to consolidate his presence in north Wales. He was deputy lieutenant for Denbighshire and Flintshire in 1679&#150;89, and served as mayor of Holt in 1682&#150;3. He was a member of the commission into encroached lands in Denbighshire in 1684 and was made a freeman of Denbigh the following year. Among his charitable bequests was a &pound;100 subscription to Denbigh grammar school.<br>
<br>Trevor was returned for Denbigh boroughs in 1685. At the opening of parliament on 19 May he was proposed for the speakership by the secretary of state, Charles Middleton, and deemed suitable &#145;by reason of his great integrity, knowledge of the laws of the land and of the rules and orders of this House&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS, 507, fol. 40). With the support of his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14702/', "Sir George Jeffreys")</script> and the king he was accepted without opposition. As a staunch tory he must have been comfortable presiding over this tory-dominated assembly. On 12 October 1685 he was rewarded for political service with the mastership of the rolls&#151;it is no coincidence that the appointment followed Jeffreys' elevation to the position of lord chancellor. For the last few weeks of the parliamentary session Trevor held both offices simultaneously.<br>
<br>On 6 July 1688 Trevor was appointed to the privy council and he was one of the few who attended James II's last privy council meeting on 16 December. This loyalty led to a temporary loss of favour at the start of the reign of William and Mary. He was elected MP for Bere Alston in 1689 but was deprived of his other influential positions. Still, his legal expertise meant that he was appointed solicitor-general to the queen in 1689 and he became the self-appointed leader of the tories during this parliament. He was elected MP for Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight in 1690. The previous summer William III had commented to the marquess of Halifax that he considered Trevor to be &#145;such a knave that it would be objected if he was employed&#146;  (Foxcroft, 2.228). Despite such concerns Trevor's usefulness could not be ignored and when parliament convened on 20 March 1690 he was proposed for the speaker's chair by Sir John Lowther, the vice-chamberlain, and once again was accepted without opposition. Trevor's career now went from strength to strength. He was appointed first commissioner of the great seal in June 1690 in the place of Sir John Maynard, and on 1 January 1691 he was restored to the privy council. Two years later, on 13 January 1693, he was reinstated as master of the rolls.<br>
<br>As speaker it was Trevor's responsibility to decide who should speak in debate, even though his choice could be overruled by a majority of MPs. Anecdotes about his behaviour exist in plenty. He was very obviously cross-eyed and tales developed about how this meant that during debate more than one member could think that they had &#145;caught the Speaker's eye&#146;. There is nothing to substantiate these tales in recorded debate; it is more likely that Trevor conformed with the tradition of allowing government spokesmen to take the floor at the most tactically advantageous time, and otherwise ensured that he chose speakers in a way which protected him against any accusations of blatant bias.<br>
<br>The speaker's office was an openly partisan one so in addition to managing debates Trevor was expected to promote the king's business. In the main he seems to have coped successfully with these demands until his speakership came to an abrupt end in 1695 when he found himself at the centre of a House of Commons inquiry into corruption. On 12 March 1695 Paul Foley, reporting from the select committee, informed the house that on 12 February 1693 the common council of London had ordered that 1000 guineas should be given to Sir John Trevor in return for his support in relation to the <span class="roman">London Orphans Bill</span>. The order was endorsed with the information that the payment had indeed been made on 22 June in the presence of witnesses. This report led to a four-hour debate on Trevor's behaviour chaired by Trevor himself. At nine o'clock Trevor was placed in the uncomfortable position of stating the question on a motion condemning his own behaviour. The house decided that he was guilty &#145;of a high crime and misdemeanour&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 11.271).<br>
<br>The following day Trevor was absent from the house, having been &#145;taken with a violent fit of the colic&#146; and the house was forced to adjourn  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 11.271). On 14 March the house received a second letter of apology from the speaker whereupon Thomas Wharton, comptroller of the household, announced that the king gave leave for the election of a new speaker. On 16 March the house passed an order that Trevor should be expelled. As investigations continued it was discovered that Trevor was also one of the members who had accepted gratuities from the East India Company. On 3 May it was decided that the ex-speaker should be impeached for his behaviour but the prorogation of parliament protected Trevor from this fate.<br>
<br>Corruption charges ended his time in the chair but Trevor's career in public office continued. He retained the mastership of the rolls until his death. There is no evidence to suggest that he was anything other than impartial in legal affairs and his decisions were cited by later judges. During the reign of Queen Anne he was sworn of the privy council in June 1702 and was also returned to his Welsh offices. He was constable of Flint Castle from 1705 until his death and <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Flintshire (1705&#150;14). He died intestate in London on 20 May 1717 and was buried in the Rolls Chapel in Chancery Lane ten days later. He was reputed to have left a fortune of &pound;60,000 which was divided among his children. Trevor's sons died without heirs and the Bryncunallt estate eventually passed to his daughter Anne.<br>
