<span class="headword">Randolph,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1632, <em>d.</em> 1703), <span class="occ">colonial administrator in America</span>, was born in Canterbury, and baptized on 9 July 1632, the son of Dr Edmund Randolph (1600&#150;1649), physician and a graduate of the University of Padua and University College, Oxford, and his wife, Deborah (<i>d</i>. 1666?), daughter of Giles Master. The family owned lands around Biddenden, south-west of Canterbury. Randolph was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1650 and to Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1651, but is not recorded as having graduated or been called to the bar. By 1660 he had married Jane (1640&#150;1679), the daughter of Thomas Gibbon of West Cliffe, Kent, and his wife, Alice Taylor, with whom he had four daughters. The marriage connected him with the family of Robert Tufton Mason, claimant to the proprietorship of New Hampshire, opening the way to government employment and his subsequent career in North America.<br>
<br>For several years Randolph served as muster-master for the Cinque Ports and supplied timber for the Royal Navy. By the 1670s, however, he was in dire financial straits, and in the spring of 1676 Mason procured his appointment to carry a royal letter to the Massachusetts government requiring a response to Mason's claims, at which time he was also to gather information on New England's condition and its people's loyalty to the crown. He reached Boston in June, and returned to London in September, submitting several lengthy papers charging the Massachusetts government with abuse of its charter powers, tolerance of illegal trade, and tyranny over both its own citizens and its New England neighbours. Later he proposed plans for royal intervention. The detailed, if strongly partisan, information he provided and the forensic skills he displayed in its presentation were essential to the legal processes that culminated in the crown's 1684 annulment of the Massachusetts charter of government.<br>
<br>Randolph now began a long career as royal office holder in America. In June 1678 he was commissioned collector of customs in New England, a post that, following his return to Boston in December 1679, gave him abundant opportunity to experience and report back further instances of the colonists' disdain for royal authority. He served as councillor and attorney-general in the royal government set up in New Hampshire in 1679. In 1681 he married Grace Grenville, who died in December the following year. He married, third, in 1684, Sarah Platt, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Backhouse (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1650), who predeceased him and with whom he had a fifth daughter. In alliance with a small group of colonists he identified as willing to collaborate with the crown, he played a major role in planning the new form of government, the dominion of New England, which was created in 1685 to replace the puritan regime in Massachusetts and also included the other New England colonies and later New York. Within the dominion Randolph accumulated the further offices of councillor, secretary and register, deputy postmaster, surveyor of woods, and deputy to William Blathwayt, auditor-general for the American colonies.<br>
<br>Randolph worked busily to advance his own fortunes in tandem with royal authority. But his sweeping plans to regulate trade, reissue land titles, and further the cause of the Church of England in America were intensely unpopular. He found himself increasingly excluded from power by his fellow royalists, especially after the dominion passed in 1686 under the rule of a new and autocratic royal governor, Sir Edmund Andros. As news of the revolution of 1688 reached Boston, popular discontent exploded into revolt. On 18 April 1689 Randolph and other members of the dominion government were seized and imprisoned before being sent back to England in February 1690. There they were exonerated from charges of misgovernment after a hearing before the committee of trade and plantations, and Randolph was given new employment in October 1691 as surveyor-general of customs throughout the American colonies.<br>
<br>Randolph landed in Virginia in April 1692 and began a three-year inspection of almost every eastern port between Maine and North Carolina. Throughout he uncovered evidence of inadequate record-keeping and official connivance with illegal trade, touching off several sharp conflicts with local authorities. When summarized in a formal report to the customs commissioners on his return to England in September 1695, his information led directly to the 1696 enactment, largely drafted by Randolph and sustained by his testimony before parliament, that significantly tightened regulation of colonial trade. From December 1697 until the summer of 1700 he was again in America, supervising enforcement of the new regulations and sniffing out local malfeasance. In Bermuda, in consequence, he spent nine months in prison before securing his release and the governor's dismissal. He repeatedly proposed the consolidation of the American colonies under direct royal authority, a plan adopted by the Board of Trade in a bill placed before parliament in 1701 but never enacted. In the autumn of 1702 he travelled once more to America&#151;his seventeenth transatlantic voyage. He died in Virginia in April 1703 and was buried in Accomack county, Virginia.<br>
<br>Randolph typified a new species of emigrant to America in these years, of men who identified their own advancement with that of royal authority, farming the colonists rather than the land. But he was exceptional in his tireless zeal and grasp of larger issues of policy, his refusal to compromise with friend and foe alike, and the rigour and accuracy of his countless letters and reports. Though generously salaried by the crown and given many opportunities for personal profit, he did not die a wealthy man. His legacy was rather the tightening of imperial control and an enduring suspicion among the colonists of the men and methods deemed necessary to secure it.<br>

<a name="cosubject_23114"></a><span class="headword">Bernard Randolph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1643, <em>d.</em> after 1689?), <span class="occ">writer</span>, the son of Edmund Randolph and Deborah Master and Edward Randolph's younger brother, was born in Canterbury and baptized in October 1643. By 1664 he was living in Smyrna and he traded extensively through the Aegean region of the Ottoman empire until after 1680. Between 1683 and 1684 he travelled three times to Massachusetts to assist his elder brother Edward as deputy collector of customs. Back in England he published in 1686 <span class="italic">The Present State of the Morea</span>, a brief account of the port cities of the Peloponnese. A year later followed a longer, more anecdotal work, <span class="italic">The Present State of the Islands in the Archipelago</span>, in which Randolph interwove his own travels with descriptions of trading conditions and the conflict between Ottoman and Venetian rule in the lands around the Aegean. He died probably after 1689.<br>
