<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pierrepont,  Evelyn</span>, first duke of Kingston upon Hull  (<em>bap. </em>1667, <em>d.</em> 1726), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at West Dean, Wiltshire, and baptized on 27 February 1667. He was the third son of Robert Pierrepont of Thoresby, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1692), the daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52646/', "Sir John Evelyn")</script> of West Dean. He was educated at Winchester College and at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated on 19 May 1683 and received an LLD on 16 April 1705. By licence dated 27 June 1687 he married Lady Mary Feilding (<i>d</i>. 1697), the only daughter of William, third earl of Denbigh; they had one son, William, earl of Kingston, who died on 1 July 1713, and three daughters, including Mary, a celebrated scholar, who married Edward Wortley Montagu in 1712.<br>
<br>Pierrepont sat in the Convention Parliament in January 1689 as MP for East Retford, a seat which he held at the general election in March 1690. On 17 September of that year he succeeded his brother William as fifth earl of Kingston upon Hull. In 1701 he became deputy lieutenant of Wiltshire; he also held the post of recorder of Nottingham from 1707 until his death. He was appointed one of the commissioners for the union with Scotland on 10 April 1706, and was created marquess of Dorchester on 23 December of that year. He was admitted to the privy council on 26 June 1708, and in November presented the address of condolence and thanks to the queen. Dorchester, a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script>, appears to have been popular as well as successful in these years. John Macky, writing in 1705, described him as a &#145;very fine gentleman, of good sense, well-bred, and a lover of the ladies; intirely in the interest of his country; makes a good figure, is of a black complexion, well made, not forty years old&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 75).<br>
<br>In 1711 Dorchester voted against the ministry on the &#145;No peace without Spain&#146; motion, and on 28 May the following year signed a strongly worded protest against &#145;the restraining orders&#146; sent to the duke of Ormond, together with a protest against the peace. His whig credentials were again apparent when on 15 June 1714 he signed the protest against the passing of the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span>, which had been carried by a small majority in the Lords. He was sworn a member of George I's privy council on 16 November 1714, and served as warden and chief justice in eyre of the royal forests north of the Trent from 4 November 1714 until December 1716. On 1 December 1714 he was promoted lord lieutenant of Wiltshire, which office he held until his death. He married his second wife, Lady Isabella Bentinck, the fifth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2160/', "William Bentinck, first earl of Portland")</script>, on 2 August 1714. Lady Belle Bentinck was apparently one of the most admired beauties in London; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Kingston was created duke of Kingston upon Hull on 10 August 1715, and it was in this capacity that, on 10 April 1716, he supported the second reading of the <span class="roman">Septennial Bill</span>. Further evidence of his loyalty to the whig ministry is to be found in his initial vote for, and then against, Oxford's impeachment in June 1717 in line with the government's change of policy. His service was rewarded with a number of appointments. Between December 1716 and February 1718 he was lord privy seal, on 6 February 1719 he became lord president of the council, and on 29 April he was elected a knight of the Garter. He resigned the post of lord president on 11 June 1720 and resumed his former office of keeper of the privy seal. He also acted as one of the lords justices during the king's absence from England in 1719, 1720, 1723, and 1725&#150;6. He died at his house in Arlington Street, Piccadilly, London, on 5 March 1726, and was buried at Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire. He was survived by his widow, who died in Paris on 23 February 1728 and was buried at Holme Pierrepont on 3 May. Following the death of his only son in 1713, the dukedom passed to his grandson, Evelyn.<br>
