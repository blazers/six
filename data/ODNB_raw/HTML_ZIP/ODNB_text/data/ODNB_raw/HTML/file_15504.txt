<span class="headword">Keys,  Samuel</span>  (1771&#150;1850), <span class="occ">china painter</span>, is of unknown parentage. He was one of the principal gilders and china painters in the old Derby china factory under William Duesbury the elder, to whom he was articled in 1795. Keys was an excellent workman, and much of the success of the china, especially the figures in the Dresden style, was due to his skill in decoration. On 3 August 1795 he married, at Dronfield, Derbyshire, Hannah Gratton, with whom he had three sons. He left Derby some years before the close of the factory and went to work under Minton at Stoke-on-Trent. Later he returned to Derby, where he died in 1850, in his eightieth year. Keys preserved his delicacy of execution to the last. He collected materials for the history of the Derby china factory, which form the foundation of subsequent accounts, notably that by William Chaffers in <span class="italic">Marks and Monograms</span> (1863).<br>
<br>Keys's three sons were all apprenticed at the Derby factory. <a name="cosubject_74562"></a><span class="headword">John Keys</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1797, <em>d.</em> 1825), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was baptized on 8 September 1797 at St Alkmund's, Derby. He became a skilled flower painter in watercolour and teacher of that art. Some of his pieces were shown in the Derby exhibition of china in 1870; one fine example of his work entered the collection of Joseph Mayer of Liverpool. His watercolour drawings, which included numerous studies of flowers from nature, were described as &#145;truthful and masterly&#146;  (Haslem, 105). He died at the age of twenty-eight. His <span class="italic">Sketches of Old Derby</span> was published in 1895. <a name="cosubject_74561"></a><span class="headword">Edward Keys</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1795), <span class="occ">modeller</span>, was baptized on either 21 July or 23 August 1795 (two entries for his baptism in the parish register give variant dates) at All Saints, Derby. He left Derby about 1826 and went to work for Messrs Minton, Daniell, and others in the Staffordshire potteries. He was noted for his small personages, including a statuette of Dr Syntax which sold well. Among his other modelled figures were George IV and Napoleon and characters from Pierce Egan's <span class="italic">Life in London</span>. <a name="cosubject_74563"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Keys the younger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1804), <span class="occ">modeller</span>, excelled in modelling small figures of leading theatrical personages, especially comic actors, which sold for between 6 and 8 shillings. His larger figures (28 inches high) of <span class="italic">Innocence</span> and <span class="italic">Hebe</span> are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He left Derby in 1830 and went to the Staffordshire potteries district, where he was employed by several firms. In partnership with John Mountford, described by Haslem as the originator of the medium, he established a manufactory for producing Parian ware. He also designed and modelled ornamental objects in majolica and terracotta from drawings of flowers and foliage made by his brother John.<br>
