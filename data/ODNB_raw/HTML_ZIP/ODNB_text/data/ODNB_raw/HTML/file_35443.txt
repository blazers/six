<span class="headword">Pearson,  Weetman Dickinson</span>, first Viscount Cowdray  (1856&#150;1927), <span class="occ">building contractor and oil producer</span>, was born on 15 July 1856 at Woodfield House, Shelley, Kirkburton, near Huddersfield, eldest son among the eight children of George Pearson (<i>d</i>. 1899), of Brickendonbury, near Hertford, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1911), daughter of Weetman Dickinson, of High Hoyland, Yorkshire. Pearson attended a private school, Hallfield, in Bowling, Bradford, and at the age of thirteen went to Pannal College, near Harrogate. He left school at sixteen, and was apprenticed to the family firm of builders and contractors, S. Pearson &amp; Son, founded by his grandfather, Samuel Pearson.<br>
<br>This marked the beginning of a remarkable and highly successful business career. In 1875, three years after joining the family business, Pearson was sent on a tour to the United States to seek new business, especially orders for the bricks, tiles, and piping whose manufacture was a major concern of the Bradford firm. He was very impressed by the energy and dynamism of the United States and, in turn, his visit was so successful that he was given growing responsibilities at S. Pearson &amp; Son. In 1879 his grandfather retired from the business and gave him his share in it, making him his father's sole partner. Subsequently Pearson aggressively expanded the firm's business outside the north of England, especially in London, to which city he moved the headquarters in 1884. After the move to London, Pearson effectively ran the business, and in 1894 he became the sole partner. On 22 June 1881 he married Annie (1862&#150;1932), daughter of Sir John Cass, of Bradford, Yorkshire; they had three sons, the youngest of whom was killed in action during the First World War, and one daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32781/', "Gertrude Mary Denman, Lady Denman")</script>.<br>
<br>Under Pearson's leadership the company rapidly emerged as one of Britain's leading contractors. During the 1880s the firm undertook major construction works in Britain and overseas. These included major dock construction projects at Milford Haven (1885&#150;90), Southampton (1886&#150;91), and Halifax in Nova Scotia (1886&#150;9). In 1889 Pearson won two major contracts in the United States and Mexico which secured his leading role as a British contractor. The former was to build the Hudson River tunnel to connect New York with Jersey City, and the latter was construction of the Grand Canal designed to drain the swampy plateau on which stood Mexico City. The successful completion of these projects was followed by the construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the Thames between 1891 and 1897, the building of the four East River tunnels connecting New York with Long Island for the Pennsylvania, New York, and Long Island Railroad Company in the 1900s, and a considerable number of railways, port and other infrastructure projects in Mexico.<br>
<br>Pearson's personality and business skills lay at the heart of his firm's success. He had immense personal magnetism, an urge to achieve and to succeed, and a capacity for hard work. He was motivated neither by money nor by social prestige, but rather by a restless search for new challenges. He had a notable ability to accept mistakes and to learn from failures which stood him in good stead, though in practice the number of failures were few, both because of good judgement and because he appeared to be unusually lucky. Contemporaries referred often to &#145;Pearson luck&#146;.<br>
<br>Pearson possessed an unusual combination of entrepreneurial vision and the technical skills of an engineer. He had an extraordinary ability to perceive new opportunities and a willingness to take risks. Endowed with considerable technical knowledge and a profound understanding of both the engineering and strategic dimensions of the contracting business, Pearson was also noted for his considerable financial acumen. He costed many major contracts personally, or else relied on a trusted group of associates. He skilfully employed bank overdrafts, using his clients' securities as collateral, to finance large contracts, which made the work virtually self-financing.<br>
<br>Pearson's entrepreneurial spirit led him to become the pioneer of the Mexican oil industry. This remarkable development grew out of S. Pearson &amp; Son's extensive construction work in Mexico, during which oil seepages had been discovered while looking for rock for harbour works. In April 1901 Pearson, because of a missed train connection, spent a night at Laredo on the Mexico&#150;United States border, which was close to a large oil discovery in the Texan oilfields. Although entirely ignorant of the petroleum industry, he glimpsed the commercial opportunities if oil could also be discovered in Mexico, and began to acquire oil concessions, a process facilitated by his close relations with the Mexican dictator, Diaz. By 1907 the firm owned 600,000 acres of land in that country. There followed a considerable business drama and a vivid demonstration of &#145;Pearson luck&#146;. Pearson invested heavily in refining facilities and shipping, but his drillers found comparatively little oil. He was forced to buy oil in Texas to meet his marketing commitments, and by 1908 things looked desperate as his personal fortune had been pledged to support the oil business. He also became embroiled in a vicious trade war with the American company which had formerly dominated the Mexican market. But in 1910 Pearson's drillers struck oil on an enormous scale. By 1914 Mexico had become the third largest oil producing country in the world, after the United States and Russia, and Pearson controlled about 60 per cent of this production. He created a large, vertically integrated business which controlled oil production, refining, distribution, and selling.<br>
<br>Pearson pursued a rather reluctant political career. He was elected a Liberal MP for Colchester in 1895, after failing to win the seat three years earlier, and retired in 1910. He appears never to have spoken in the House of Commons and he was so frequently absent that his critics called him the &#145;member for Mexico&#146;. Nevertheless, he had strong political beliefs, advocating old-age pensions and other welfare measures, supporting the principle of home rule for Ireland, and&#151;together with his wife&#151;actively advocating female suffrage. For his various services Pearson was created baronet in 1894 and raised to the peerage in 1910 as Baron Cowdray, of Midhurst, Sussex. During the First World War Cowdray served as president of the Air Board in 1917. The output of aircraft increased significantly during his appointment, but he resigned in November of that year on learning that the prime minister, Lloyd George, had offered the newly created Air Ministry to Lord Northcliffe rather than to himself. Cowdray was created a viscount in 1917.<br>
<br>Cowdray maintained an active business career after the end of the war. Concerned about the deteriorating political situation in Mexico and anxious to pursue new business activities, in 1919 he sold the majority of his equity in the Mexican oil business to the Shell group. The deal was a further manifestation of &#145;Pearson luck&#146;, for by 1922 the most prolific Mexican oil well had been infiltrated by salt water, and in 1938 all foreign-owned oil properties in Mexico were nationalized. However, Cowdray continued to be involved in the oil business, and his drillers searched for oil in a range of countries, including Britain, where they had discovered oil in Derbyshire in 1917. The only long-term and commercially viable discoveries were made in the United States, where in 1919 Cowdray participated in the formation of the Amerada Petroleum Corporation. He also continued to be closely involved with contracting, especially the huge Sennar Dam project in the Sudan, designed to irrigate the Gezira plain which lay in the triangle between the Blue and White Niles to the south of Khartoum.<br>
<br>Cowdray was a generous benefactor to good causes. He gave &pound;325,000 to establish the Royal Air Force Club after the end of the First World War, and made substantial donations to a number of universities, including Aberdeen, Birmingham, Cambridge, and University College, London. He owned extensive estates in Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire, and made substantial donations to various causes in Aberdeen. In 1920 he was unanimously elected lord rector of Aberdeen University.<br>
<br>Cowdray was made GCVO in 1925. On 1 May 1927, two days before he was due to become a freeman of Aberdeen, he died in his sleep at his home, Dunecht House, Dunecht, Aberdeenshire, having suffered for some time from heart disease. He was buried at Echt on 3 May.<br>
