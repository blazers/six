<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pratt,  John Jeffreys</span>, first Marquess Camden  (1759&#150;1840), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 11 February 1759 at 34 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, and baptized on 13 March, the eldest child and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22699/', "Charles Pratt, first Earl Camden (1714&#150;1794)")</script>, politician and judge, of Camden Place, Chislehurst, Kent, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1779), daughter and heir of Nicholas Jeffreys of Brecon Priory, Brecknockshire.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerto1794"></a>Early career, to 1794</h2>The Hon. John Pratt, as he was known after his father became Baron Camden in 1765, was educated by the Revd Thomas Powys, later dean of Canterbury, at Fawley, Buckinghamshire, and may also have attended Eton College about 1773. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 11 November 1776 and graduated MA three years later. Among his university friends was William Pitt the younger, the second son of his father's closest political associate. In March 1779 Pratt became an ensign in the West Kent militia, and was promoted lieutenant in the following May, but he resigned his commission in June 1782. On 21 May 1780 he succeeded to one of the tellerships of the exchequer, a lucrative sinecure, the reversion to which had been secured for him fourteen years earlier by Camden on the latter's resignation as chief justice of common pleas.<br>
<br>Pratt, who supported the aims of the association movement at the Kent county meeting on 22 April 1780 and joined Brooks's Club in May, was returned to parliament as MP for Bath, where his father had a substantial interest, at the general election later that year. A young man about town, he initially took little interest in politics and failed to live up to expectations in the Commons. However, on 12 June 1781 he spoke against the war with the American colonies, and on 6 May 1782 for economies in the management of the exchequer, despite his own vested interest. Having voted regularly with the opposition to Lord North's administration, in July 1782 he was appointed a lord of the Admiralty in Lord Shelburne's ministry, in which his father served as lord president. He voted with his colleagues in favour of the peace preliminaries on 17 February 1783 and left office with them on the accession of the Fox&#150;North coalition. He voted for Pitt's parliamentary reform motion on 7 May and against Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span> on 27 November 1783. Like Camden he resumed his former office on the appointment of Pitt as prime minister in December 1783.<br>
<br>On 31 December 1785, at Lord Lucan's house in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, Westminster, he married Frances (1766&#150;1829), daughter and heir of William Molesworth of Wembury, Devon, and Anne Elizabeth Smith. Owing his position mostly to his connection with Pitt, Viscount Bayham (as he was styled from 1786) remained a solid and popular, if undistinguished and almost entirely silent, junior minister. He left the Admiralty to be a lord of the Treasury in August 1789, and was sworn of the privy council on 21 June 1793 on being named a member of the Board of Trade. He succeeded his father as second Earl Camden on 18 April 1794 and inherited estates in Kent, including Wildernesse, near Sevenoaks, where he had lived since his marriage. No longer MP for Bath, he followed his father as recorder of the borough (until 1835) and for many years exercised the electoral patronage over one of its seats. He relinquished his position in the government but continued to give it his support and, having been introduced to the House of Lords on 13 May, he seconded the address of thanks there on 30 December 1794.<h2>
<a name="LordlieutenantofIreland17951798"></a>Lord lieutenant of Ireland, 1795&#150;1798</h2>Camden, whom Pitt had previously approached with a view to taking on the role, was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland on 11 March 1795. His tenure in Dublin was more significant for the events that immediately preceded and followed it than for the uninspired application during it of the twin policies of concession and repression, which as usual characterized British attitudes towards its nearest colony. Yet the period also witnessed developments of vital importance for the future of the sister kingdom. Aged just thirty-six and lacking appropriate experience for so demanding a position as viceroy, Camden nevertheless impressed the ascendancy with his character, being described by Lord Charlemont as &#145;a plain, unaffected, good humoured man, of pleasing conversation and conciliatory address&#146;  (<span class="italic">Charlemont MSS</span>, 2.264). He displayed considerable assiduity in fulfilling his functions, as well as a good deal of personal bravery, not least during the riot that greeted his arrival in Ireland on 31 March, when he was admitted to the privy council there. But, taking over at a difficult time, his talents were insufficient for the task confronting him and he was ill served both by the largely distracted ministry in London and by the government, or &#145;Castle&#146;, interest in Dublin.<br>
<br>During his short administration Camden's predecessor, Earl Fitzwilliam, who was drawn from the whig contingent of Pitt's wartime coalition, had raised hopeless expectations among opposition politicians and leading representatives of the majority Catholic population. As instructed by George III and Pitt, Camden reversed Fitzwilliam's ill-advised changes, reassuring the protestant &eacute;lite by reinstating the so-called Irish cabinet of senior office-holders, upon whom he was thereafter largely dependent. As expected, and believing that the times made any such steps impracticable, he also crushed the attempt to enable Catholics to sit in parliament and to hold high office, Henry Grattan's motion being defeated in the Irish Commons by 155 votes to 84 on 5 May 1795. In line with the long-term policy of securing the loyalty of the Catholic priesthood, as well as in compensation for the defeat of Catholic emancipation, he oversaw the opening of St Patrick's College, Maynooth, later that year and laid the foundation stone of its new building on 20 April 1796.<br>
<br>Yet rural violence continued, with the sectarian struggle reaching a new peak on 21 September 1795, when the battle of the Diamond, near Loughgall, in co. Armagh, between Catholic Defenders and protestant Peep o'Day Boys led to the formation of the Orange Order. The arming of the secret society of United Irishmen, which except in the north was mainly Catholic in composition, made it necessary to pass the <span class="roman">Insurrection Act</span> (24 March 1796) and the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Suspension Act</span> (26 October), the main legislative measures in an extensive programme of repression. In addition, despite his own reservations, Camden introduced late in that year a new system for raising county yeomanry corps; largely protestant in character, these were intended for civilian peacekeeping duties as well as national defence. The abortive attempt to land French forces, accompanied by the revolutionary Theobald Wolfe Tone, at Bantry Bay in December 1796 was the most significant invasion scare during Camden's time in Ireland. The delicate European situation and the fear of domestic unrest in Britain strengthened the hand of those demanding firm action, and in March 1797 he ordered the forcible disarming of the peasantry in Ulster. However, the general election passed off peacefully that summer and on 9 January 1798 he opened what proved to be the last Irish parliament until the early twentieth century.<h2>
<a name="TheIrishrisingof1798"></a>The Irish rising of 1798</h2>Alarmed at the extent of the outrages that swept Ireland at the start of 1798, Camden was hesitant to act on the basis of conflicting intelligence reports and before damning legal proof of treasonable activity could be ascertained. However, bowing to pressure from Dublin Castle he closed down the United Irishmen's newspaper, <span class="italic">The Press</span>, ordered the arrest of the leaders of its Leinster directory in Dublin on 12 March, and issued a proclamation declaring martial law on the 30th. Critical of the conduct of the Irish gentry and magistracy&#151;by turns timid and vindictive&#151;his sentiments coincided with the view of the commander of British forces in Ireland, Sir Ralph Abercromby: that firm but disciplined measures of pacification were preferable to acts of exemplary harshness. But he could not long protect Abercromby from the furore that greeted his condemnation of the Irish army's lack of discipline, and he ultimately had little control over the excesses subsequently meted out in the name of the king's government.<br>
<br>In short Camden came across as irresolute in a crisis; in a remark that was typical of the criticisms voiced against him the southern magnate Lord Shannon wrote to his son on 11 April that &#145;Things look as bad as possible, and his Excellency very undecided, where vigour and decision are so necessary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shannon's Letters</span>, 81). Although the arrest on 19 May of Lord Edward Fitzgerald (whose family blamed Camden for his death shortly afterwards) crippled the attempted full-scale uprising, a limited one began in earnest on the night of 23&#150;4 May. There followed one of the most unsavoury episodes in Irish history, in which sporadic fighting and bloodthirsty outrages on both sides marked an unpredictable contest between disorganized rebels and an almost equally disorderly force of loyalists and semi-professional soldiers. Bewildered and despondent, Camden applied urgently for reinforcements from England, and more than once offered to resign so as to enable General Cornwallis to become joint viceroy and commander-in-chief. On Camden's repeating his offer the king agreed to the recall of the &#145;too much agitated&#146; lord lieutenant  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.1755). Cornwallis's strong military grip and steady assertion of undivided political authority rapidly restored order after his succeeding Camden on 20 June 1798.<br>
<br>Among Irish commentators there was some sympathy for Camden, who regretted that he had departed before his conduct could be vindicated by the ending of the uprising. As Sir Jonah Barrington recollected:<blockquote>Earl Camden was of a high mind, and of unblemished reputation: his principles were good, but his talent was not eminent;&#151;he always intended right, but was repeatedly led to do wrong; he wished to govern with moderation, but he was driven by his council into most violent proceedings. (Barrington, 2.244&#150;5)</blockquote>By contrast Anglo-Irish loyalist opinion was especially hostile in its judgement. The author of a popular pamphlet, <span class="italic">Considerations of the Situation to which Ireland is Reduced</span>, blamed him for tergiversation, observing that:<blockquote>though some men thought a system of <i>coercion</i> more likely to succeed than a system of <i>concession</i>;&#151;and some again gave a preference to the latter; yet, that there was one mode of proceeding which by all honest men of every party was equally condemned, and that was a system which, by <i>weakly</i> attempting a mixture of both, became neither <i>coercion</i> nor <i>concession</i>. (p. 28)</blockquote>In essence, however, Camden's role was that of a largely powerless agent faced with tumultuous political challenges, and his influence probably did little either to provoke or to contain the uprising. Indeed it could be argued that his most important legacy as lord lieutenant was in bringing to the fore&#151;first as private secretary and then as acting replacement chief secretary to the ailing Thomas Pelham&#151;his sister's brilliant young stepson, Viscount Castlereagh. Anxious not to appear a scapegoat for the Irish rising Camden, on his return to England, secured a seat in the cabinet (without portfolio) and the promise of a Garter (which he was awarded on 14 August 1799), while also letting it be known that he had refused a marquessate. Subject to vociferous criticisms in the British parliament he defended his record in the Lords on 19 March 1799, when he argued that he was not responsible for the murderous atrocities, many of which occurred after the end of his mandate.<h2>
<a name="Cabinetminister17981812"></a>Cabinet minister, 1798&#150;1812</h2>Camden was a firm supporter of the plan for legislative union between Britain and Ireland that Pitt had originated at the time of the uprising and praised it in parliament on 8 May 1800. Cautiously in favour of Catholic emancipation, he resigned from office with Pitt in the following February on George III's refusal to countenance such a policy, and privately blamed the outgoing prime minister for having failed to prepare the ground with the king well in advance of the union settlement. Following his chief's line of not opposing Henry Addington's administration outright he stated, in the Lords on 13 May 1802, that he approved the principle but not the details of the peace preliminaries. He returned to office with Pitt in May 1804 and was made secretary of state for war and the colonies, an office in which he was little more than a cipher, as the premier handled the most important matters. He moved the second reading of the <span class="roman">Additional Forces Bill</span> on 24 June 1804 and, among other departmental interventions, commented on the state of the national defences on 15 February and 8 March 1805. On 10 May of that year he remarked that the times were not apposite for granting Catholic relief.<br>
<br>Camden succeeded his uncle Thomas Pratt to the family estate of Bayham Abbey, on the Kent and Sussex border, in 1805, and this became his principal residence. Always declining to return to Ireland, he served from July 1805 to February 1806 in the largely decorative office of lord president of the council. Known as Lord Chuckle  (Gray, 96), he was not reckoned among the chiefs of the remaining Pittites but opposed the Grenville ministry, defending the <span class="roman">Additional Forces Act</span> on 20 May 1806. In March 1807 he resumed the lord presidency under the duke of Portland, and he continued occasionally to speak for the government in the House of Lords. He was named lord lieutenant and custos rotulorum of Kent in June 1808. An indefatigable intriguer, he was invariably privy to the negotiations that attended the rise and fall of statesmen and administrations, and among his papers can be found many of the memoranda and letters in which he provided self-justificatory accounts of his conduct on these occasions.<br>
<br>The most disgraceful affair in which Camden was implicated was the proposed reshuffle that culminated in the duel of 1809 between Castlereagh and his ambitious rival, George Canning. With less excuse than his cabinet colleagues, given what had hitherto been his close connection with Castlereagh, he connived at the ministerial deceit practised upon his nephew, who was soon to be ousted. When the brouhaha became generally known it was to Camden that Canning addressed his public explanation in the form of <span class="italic">A Letter</span>, published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 28 November 1809 and then in pamphlet form. The affair exposed Camden as a liability, and Canning, ever an opponent, in that year described him, along with Lord Westmorland, as &#145;useless lumber&#146; in the ministry  (<span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence</span>, 2.180). However, Camden retained his post under Spencer Perceval from that time until April 1812, and was a minister without portfolio in Lord Liverpool's cabinet from then until the close of the year. He retired from high office with the consolation of a promotion in the peerage, being made Marquess Camden on 7 September 1812.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife18121840"></a>Later life, 1812&#150;1840</h2>Camden expressed himself cautiously in favour of granting Catholic emancipation on 1 July 1812. From that time onwards he spoke rarely in parliament but backed Liverpool's tory government, applauding the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill</span> on 19 June 1817 and the <span class="roman">Irish Insurrection Bill</span> on 9 February 1822. Reiterating his former views on the Catholic question he again supported it on 17 May 1825 and, having advocated concessions at the Kent county meeting on 24 October 1828, he spoke and voted for it in the house on 10 April 1829. He divided against the Grey ministry's parliamentary reform bills on 7 October 1831 and 13 April 1832, and thereafter continued to act with the duke of Wellington's Conservative opposition in parliament. On 14 August 1833 he was appointed one of the original members of the judicial committee of the privy council. Having received a doctorate of laws from Cambridge in 1832 he became chancellor of the university on 12 December 1834, and many of his later parliamentary interventions were on the subject of higher education.<br>
<br>Camden's tellership had long been the object of radical condemnation, particularly because of its inflated wartime profits, which rose ten-fold from about &pound;2500 in 1782 to about &pound;24,000 in 1808. However, he had voluntarily contributed &pound;7000 a year in taxes between 1798 and 1802 and had remitted a third of the revenues from 1812 until the end of the war in 1815. On 11 February 1817 Castlereagh told the Commons that his uncle had decided to renounce all the revenue paid to him except for a salary of &pound;2500 a year, and this arrangement was given statutory form in Marquess Camden's <span class="roman">Tellership Act</span> of 1819 (59 Geo. III c. 43). He was thanked by parliament on 21 May 1819 for this &#145;large sacrifice of public fortune to the service of his country&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>) and received numerous public accolades for his munificent gesture. Because of the extraordinary size of his contribution, which amounted to just under &pound;245,000 in 1834, he was exempted (by clause 30) from the abolition of the office under the <span class="roman">Exchequer Receipt Act</span> of 1834 (4 and 5 Wm. IV c. 15), and his income from the now defunct office finally lapsed only on his death.<br>
<br>Camden, who was elected FSA in 1802, held numerous minor and charitable offices. In 1805 he was chosen an elder brother of Trinity House, of which he was master three times (1809&#150;16, 1828&#150;9, and 1831&#150;7). He was appointed a governor of Charterhouse in 1811, a director of Greenwich Hospital in 1815, and a trustee of the British Museum in 1826. As well as seeing service in various troops of the Kent yeomanry during the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars he was colonel of the West Kent militia from 1827 to 1832. Remembered for his financial beneficence, Camden died at Wildernesse on 8 October 1840 and was buried in nearby Seal church on 17 October. In addition to a surviving daughter (two others predeceased him) he left an only son, George Charles Pratt (1799&#150;1866), who inherited the marquessate and estates in Kent and elsewhere, as well as the bulk of personal wealth sworn under &pound;40,000, but failed to fulfil his father's ambitions for him in national politics.<br>
