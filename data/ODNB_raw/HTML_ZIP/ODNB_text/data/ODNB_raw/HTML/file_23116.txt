<span class="headword">Randolph,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1566), <span class="occ">soldier and military administrator</span>, was one of at least three sons and two daughters of Avery Randolph (<i>d</i>. 1561), landowner, of Badlesmere, Kent, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1561), daughter of Sir John Gaynsford of Crowhurst, Surrey, and his wife, Katherine. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23122/', "Thomas Randolph (1525/6&#150;1590)")</script>, a diplomat, was one of his brothers. His wife was Sybil Croft, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6719/', "Sir James Croft")</script>. Born in Kent, he was one of Sir Thomas Wyatt's &#145;alise neighbours companions in the same profession of armes&#146;  (Loades, 50), and possibly one of his proposed militia in 1549. Not surprisingly, Randolph was involved in Wyatt's rebellion of November 1553 to February 1554, when, like many others, he escaped punishment by fleeing abroad. Two months later he was in Paris with his brother Thomas, distancing himself from the rebels there and seeking pardon from Mary's government. That was promised on condition that he remained in France and sent useful information home. Consequently, Randolph estimated rebel numbers abroad&#151;his figure, real or imagined, was 150&#151;spied on the French army, and acted as intermediary for Sir Peter Carew. His official pardon came in October, and in the following April (1555) he received an annual pension of 200 crowns from Philip II with the designation of colonel of infantry. It was a rare distinction, recognizing his military talent perhaps, but certainly intended to bind him to the Marian regime. A show of outward conformity masked Randolph's continuing opposition; he met with other sympathizers at Arundel's tavern and kept in touch with the French ambassador. He was &#145;vehemently suspected&#146;, with his brother-in-law (&#145;Croft and he all one&#146;), of complicity in the Dudley conspiracy of March 1556  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1553&#150;8</i>, 325&#150;6).<br>
<br>Hence Randolph was one of the &#145;young heads&#146;  (Loades, 245), allied by marriage and limited prospects, who opposed Mary's government both openly and surreptitiously. His credentials thus established, like &#145;other gentlemen that be soldiers&#146;  (Loades, 207&#150;8), his talents were put to good use by the Elizabethan regime. Her accession brought the rewards of military recognition and office: Randolph became a valued field commander and lieutenant of the office of ordnance. In November 1559 he was sent to Scotland with 300 men to counter the French threat and &pound;3000 &#145;to comfort the Protestants&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1559&#150;60</i>, 262). He won golden opinions at Leith: &#145;He is wise, painful, skilful and no pillar or robber&#146;, wrote Cecil to Norfolk  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1560&#150;61</i>, 242(4)).<br>
<br>In 1563 Randolph was appointed high marshal of the garrison at Le Havre, under Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, and between June and July subscribed to a series of letters, describing the inadequacies of the fortifications, the equipment, the victuals, and the pay, then, finally, the enemy trenches closing to arquebus range, the windmills lost, the ovens broken, and the bakers dead of the plague. Randolph, &#145;of whom they have great want&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1563</i>, 1042(3)), was seriously ill by 18 July, and the constable of France gave permission for an English messenger to see him.<br>
<br>After the fall of the garrison and his own repatriation, Randolph was appointed lieutenant of the ordnance, once again second in command to Warwick. (His predecessor, William Bromefield, had succumbed to wounds suffered at Le Havre.) At the Minories, Randolph carried out routine commissariat work and sat on boards of commission to inspect accounts, including those of Le Havre, Berwick, Admiral William Winter, and Lieutenant Bromefield. In July 1566 he headed an expeditionary force to Ireland. As the leaseholder of an estate in Queen's county, he may have had a particular interest. Shane O'Neill's attack on the Derry garrison in November was defeated with heavy losses, but Randolph was one of the few English casualties. After his death, which may have occurred on 12 November, his account books were put in safe custody, and his debts to the ordnance office were listed. A year later his widow had her annuity confirmed&#151;an appropriate recompense from a government now firmly established.<br>
