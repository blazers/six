<span class="headword">Penny,  Edward</span>  (1714&#150;1791), <span class="occ">portrait, historical, and genre painter</span>, was born at Knutsford, Cheshire, on 1 August 1714, and was baptized on 15 August, one of the twin elder sons of Robert Penny (1687&#150;1738), surgeon, and Clare (1683&#150;1760), daughter of William Trafford of Swythamley, Staffordshire. Many in his family had pursued a career in the church or as a surgeon, as did his twin brother, Henry. Penny, however, pursued his interest in painting and was sent to London to study with Thomas Hudson, whose influence is clearly evident in his early portraits. He subsequently studied in Rome with the portrait painter Marco Benefiale. About 1748 he returned to England and began to execute portraits in all formats from oval to full-length, a practice he continued throughout his career. Penny married on 4 September 1755 at St Anne's, Soho, London, Elizabeth (1719&#150;1790), daughter of John Simmons of Millbank, Westminster, and widow of Richard Fortnam of St George's, Hanover Square, London.<br>
<br>Just as his contemporary Sir Joshua Reynolds imbued portraiture with the grand manner, Penny developed a highly original amalgam of history painting and genre, infusing historical events with the quotidian and genre scenes with the gravitas of more elevated subjects. The first works he exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1762 were a small whole length of a lady and a scene from Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>. Penny exhibited almost yearly at the Society of Artists until 1768, sending primarily subject paintings and history paintings. In 1764 he exhibited an innovative modern dress depiction of the death of Wolfe, signed and dated 1763 (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). Another version without the subsidiary figures is at Petworth House, Sussex. Subsequent to the success of Benjamin West's version, Penny's was engraved by Richard Houston in 1772. He also displayed a scene from Swift's description of a city shower (engraved Thomas Chambers, 1775; Museum of London), one of several works by Penny that were favourably recognized by Walpole. The next year he exhibited <span class="italic">An Officer Relieving a Sick Soldier</span> (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) which Walpole noted as depicting Lord Granby. The theme of charity would become one of the most prominent in his work. Penny became the vice-president of the Society of Artists in 1765, a position he held until his resignation from the society in 1768. He then became one of the founders of the Royal Academy and was appointed the first professor of painting.<br>
<br>At the first Royal Academy exhibition in 1769, Penny avoided the prohibition against quotation by exhibiting a painting with the following title: <span class="italic">&#145;I saw a smith with his hammer thus,/The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,/With open mouth swallow a taylor's news.&#146; Shakespeare, King John</span> (Tate collection, known as <span class="italic">The Gossiping Blacksmith</span>). Ostensibly a genre painting, the picture contained marked political overtones. It was engraved in 1771 by Richard Houston as <span class="italic">The English Politicians</span> and was quickly co-opted by the supporters of John Wilkes. A print based on Penny's painting was published in the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> in 1771 with the significant addition of a print of John Wilkes hanging on the back wall of the forge. Penny exhibited almost every year from 1769 to 1782. The India Office commissioned <span class="italic">Lord Clive explaining to the nabob the situation of the invalids in India; at the same time showing him a deed whereby he relinquishes Meer Jaffier's legacy, five lacke of rupees, to the honourable East India Company, for the support of the military fund</span> (Department of the Environment, Foreign and Commonwealth Office) which was sent to the Royal Academy in 1772.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Penny executed a number of paired pictures. Two were sent to the Royal Academy in 1774, <span class="italic">The Profligate Punished by Neglect and Contempt</span> and <span class="italic">The Virtuous Comforted by Sympathy and Attention</span> (Yale U. CBA). His 1776 Royal Academy entry returned to the theme of Jane Shore. He exhibited <span class="italic">Jane Shore led to do penance at St. Pauls: the insolent in office, and pretenders to purity, by insulting the wretched, betray their own baseness</span> (Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery). The flat bright colours of the painting and planar composition depart from Penny's usual style. Given the radical nature of the composition, it is not surprising that the painting remained in the possession of his family until the middle of the twentieth century. Penny's compositional experimentations are also evident in a pair of paintings exhibited in 1780, <span class="italic">A Boy Taken out of the Water, Drowned</span> and <span class="italic">&#145;The boy by proper means recovered&#146;: vide Dr. Franklin's sermon to the Humane Society, humanie nihil a me alienum&#151;Ter.</span>, in which the principal action described in the title takes place in the background of the painting and the foreground depicts the reaction to the main events. The pair was engraved as <span class="italic">Apparent Dissolution</span> and <span class="italic">Returning Animation</span> by William Sedgwick in 1784 and by J. Corner and P. Audinet (in smaller versions).<br>
<br>Penny resigned his professorship of painting owing to ill health on 31 December 1781. In the final year of his exhibition at the Royal Academy, 1782, among the pictures he submitted were <span class="italic">Widow Costard's cow and goods distrained for taxes, are redeemed by the generosity of Johnny Pearmain</span>. Penny died at Chiswick, Middlesex, on 16 November 1791, and was buried with his wife, who had died on 30 April the preceding year, at Chessington, Surrey. Penny's lectures were bequeathed by his will to his nephew, the Ven. George Buckley Bower, archdeacon of Richmond. There is no record remaining of the lectures, although they were praised by his successor as professor of painting, James Barry.<br>
