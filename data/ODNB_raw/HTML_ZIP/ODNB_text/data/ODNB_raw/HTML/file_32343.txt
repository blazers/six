<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chadwick,  Roy</span>  (1893&#150;1947), <span class="occ">aircraft designer</span>, was born at Farnworth, near Widnes, Lancashire, on 30 April 1893, the elder son of Charles Henry Chadwick, a mechanical engineer in Manchester, and his wife, Agnes Bradshaw. Educated at a school in Urmston and at the Manchester College of Technology, Chadwick was early fascinated with the idea of flying machines, and made model gliders and aeroplanes. Having decided to make aeronautics his career, in 1911 he became associated with Alliott Verdon-Roe, a pioneer of British aviation. With R. J. Parrott and Roy H. Dobson they dedicated their lives to the design and manufacture of aeroplanes, in the small concern known as A. V. Roe &amp; Co. Ltd, later one of the largest aircraft companies. Chadwick was, therefore, from the beginning closely associated with the design of practical aircraft, including the famous Avro 504. During the First World War he worked on the design of several twin-engined biplanes and experimental fighters, and when hostilities ceased he was recognized as one of the youngest and most experienced aircraft designers. In 1920 he married Mary, daughter of Hubert Gomersall, head cashier of the English Sewing Cotton Company, Manchester; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Chadwick next designed several big military aircraft and also a number of light machines, including the Avro Baby, probably the first real light aeroplane in the world, to be followed later by the Avro Avian, famous for the record-breaking flights from England to Australia by H. J. L. Hinkler (1928) and Charles Kingsford Smith in 1930. He also devoted his energies to the development of the all-metal aeroplane.<br>
<br>Much of Chadwick's genius lay in an uncanny understanding of the need for perfect control in aeroplanes. This subtle characteristic was particularly noticeable in his trainer aircraft such as the Tutor which in 1932 replaced the 504, thus perpetuating the Avro tradition of training the Royal Air Force. Some years later, during the Second World War, another design by Chadwick, the Anson, was used extensively for training purposes. Already in 1935 events compelled him to turn his thoughts to military aviation. He designed the Manchester twin-engined heavy bomber which marked a gigantic step forward in aircraft design, although at first the project was almost abandoned on account of the failure of the engines to produce the power promised. Chadwick eventually proved the rightness of his design, however, and it was out of the Manchester that there emerged his greatest triumph, the four-engined Lancaster, capable of carrying a 10 ton bomb, and extensively used for night attack on Germany. Other wartime designs were the York and the Lincoln, followed after the war by the Lancastrian which, with the York, was used for civil aviation.<br>
<br>Chadwick's first true post-war aircraft, however, was the Tudor, the first pressurized civil aeroplane in the world. A national controversy arose over the Tudor design, but throughout Chadwick never lost faith in his aeroplane. Although production was greatly curtailed, the Tudor later proved its worth on the Berlin airlift. The Ashton, a Royal Air Force research aircraft, was a direct development of the Tudor. It was a tragic irony that it was in a Tudor that Chadwick was killed, when the plane crashed into a field at Shirl Fold Farm, Adlington, Cheshire, during a test flight on 23 August 1947.<br>
<br>Chadwick's death was an incalculable loss to the cause of British aeronautics which he had greatly served, particularly in the two wars. He designed some forty successful aircraft and the benefit of his last thoughts on design were seen in the Coastal Command Shackleton and the Avro delta-wing aircraft. Chadwick was friendly and good-humoured, but untiring in his quest for the better aeroplane. A combination of visionary and practical engineer, he could always see the next step clearly, and before he died he saw the enormous potential of jet propulsion, particularly in conjunction with the delta-wing form. He was appointed CBE and had received the honorary degree of MSc from Manchester University in 1944. He was a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.<br>
