<span class="headword">Smith,  Simon Harcourt  Nowell-</span>  (1909&#150;1996), <span class="occ">book collector</span>, was born on 5 January 1909 at Southgate Corner, Southgate Road, Winchester, the second of three sons (there was also a daughter) of Nowell Charles Smith (1871&#150;1961), assistant master of Winchester College and previously a fellow of Magdalen and New College, Oxford, and his wife, Cecil Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vernon-Harcourt (1875&#150;1961), one of the ten children of Augustus George Vernon-Harcourt FRS, patriarch of a minor Oxford dynasty. Simon and his siblings adopted the form Nowell-Smith instead of the single surname of their father. Nowell-Smith was educated at Sherborne School, where his father had become headmaster, and at New College. His Oxford career was undistinguished, but his book collecting developed there. His large account with Basil Blackwell proved, as he said, to be a good investment for both parties, in spite of his father's strong remonstrations to each.<br>
<br>His mother's cousin Sir Bruce Richmond found Nowell-Smith a job at <span class="italic">The Times</span>, where he worked from 1932 to 1940 on general duties but particularly assisting Richmond on the <span class="italic">Literary Supplement</span>. He was given the back page of the <span class="italic">Literary Supplement</span> for bibliographical news and reviews, assisted anonymously by a circle of well-informed bibliophiles who met in an informal dining club, the Biblios (or Biblioboys). The back page became an important feature of the bibliographical world.<br>
<br>On 6 October 1938 Nowell-Smith married Marion Sinclair, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crichton (1914&#150;1977), the orphaned daughter of W. S. Crichton of a prosperous Liverpool shipping family. Early in the war they found Hill House at Ewelme in Oxfordshire, which was their principal home until they moved to Headington Quarry, Oxford, in 1965. From February 1940, however, Nowell-Smith worked at the Admiralty (his eyesight not being good enough for active service), where he edited a <span class="italic">Weekly Intelligence Report</span> digesting press information. He worked alongside the poet William Plomer, whose posthumously published autobiography (1975) he edited; Ian Fleming, then a journalist, was another colleague. Nowell-Smith served there until February 1946, having decided at the end of 1944 not to return to <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>Nowell-Smith had long been an enthusiast for the writings of Henry James (his definitive collection is now at McMaster University Library) and compiled a lively biographical anthology about him: <span class="italic">The Legend of the Master</span> (1947). This enhanced his own literary reputation and in 1950 was influential in his being invited to become librarian of the London Library. He started there in October 1950. It was not an easy time to take over, not least because his predecessor, C. J. Purnell, had been retained to complete a further volume of the printed catalogue. Nowell-Smith had the full support of his committee, which soon felt the presence of a distinctive personality as their librarian: &#145;he is an odd crotchety little man&#146;, the chairman Harold Nicolson wrote in his diary, &#145;but I like him.&#146; He revived an institution that was still recovering from the war, acquisitions were given a clearer focus, and the printed catalogues were brought up to date. The Nowell-Smiths enjoyed living in London, but he found the job unsatisfying and resigned after only six years, leaving the library in much better shape than he had found it.<br>
<br>Nowell-Smith was short in stature (some friends knew him as &#145;the Bantam&#146;); he dressed with flair, and there was a sharp and quizzical look behind his round horn-rimmed glasses. He wrote much in bibliographical journals under his own name or as Michael Trevanion. Though he insisted he was an amateur, his combination of detailed technical knowledge and exacting literary taste proved otherwise. In the 1960s he started work on <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span> for the Clarendon edition of Dickens's novels but did not find the effort satisfying: his notes were passed on to another editor. He had a sustained interest in publishing history, anticipating later views of its importance. His main contribution was <span class="italic">International Copyright Law and the Publisher in the Reign of Queen Victoria</span> (1969) based on his Oxford lectures as Lyell reader in bibliography in 1965&#150;6. It is a concise but authoritative guide to a complex subject. He advised Macmillans on the disposal of the firm's archives, now in Reading University and at the British Library: <span class="italic">Letters to Macmillan</span> (1967), a well-constructed anthology, is the by-product of his investigations.<br>
<br>From 1956 Hill House at Ewelme again became Nowell-Smith's main home, until he moved to Oxford in 1965, and he wrote of his own library as &#145;The Ewelme collection&#146;. From the very start he had not been a retentive collector. As with Henry James, he collected Robert Bridges in depth; the latter group is now at the University of South Carolina. He keenly collected what he termed &#145;the four Georges&#146; (Borrow, Eliot, Meredith, and Gissing). His most sustained interest, however, was in English poetry from Landor to the First World War. He relished rarity but valued readability even more. Latterly he sold many minor items to concentrate on inscribed first editions or association copies of the greatest English poets of his chosen period. A loan exhibition, &#145;Wordsworth to Robert Graves and beyond&#146;, was shown at the Bodleian Library in 1983.<br>
<br>Nowell-Smith's wife died in 1977, and in 1986 he married, second, an art book dealer, Judith (<i>b</i>. 1944/5), daughter of the American bibliophile Frederick Baldwin Adams. The marriage did not succeed, and Nowell-Smith and his second wife latterly lived apart. He died of Alzheimer's disease on 28 March 1996 at St Luke's Nursing Home in Oxford where he had spent his final three years. His remaining collection was sold to the London dealers Bertram Rota Ltd, and formed their substantial catalogue number 300 in 2002.<br>
