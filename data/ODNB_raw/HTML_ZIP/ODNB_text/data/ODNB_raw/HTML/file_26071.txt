<span class="headword">Sowerby,  George Brettingham, the first</span>  (1788&#150;1854), <span class="occ">conchologist and natural history dealer</span>, was born at Lambeth, London, on 12 May 1788, the second son among the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26073/', "James Sowerby (1757&#150;1822)")</script>, botanical artist and natural history periodical publisher, and his wife, Anne de Carle (1764&#150;1815). His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26074/', "James De Carle Sowerby (1787&#150;1871)")</script>. The first G. B. Sowerby is thought to have been educated at home by private tutors, but, as with all the children, he was soon caught up in the production and publication of the Sowerby natural history works, contributing descriptions to the <span class="italic">Mineral Conchology</span> (1812&#150;22).<br>
<br>On 16 May 1811 G. B. Sowerby the first married Elizabeth Meredith. The couple had nine children, including <a href="#cosubject_26071">George Brettingham Sowerby the second</a> and <a href="#cosubject_26072">Henry Sowerby [<i>see below</i>]</a>. It seems likely that an estrangement from his father at about this time, thought by some to be due to business matters  (Sowerby, <span class="italic">Saga</span>, 43; Macdonald, 395) was, instead, due to his marriage. Whatever the cause, the estrangement led to G. B. Sowerby establishing himself as a dealer in natural history objects at King Street, Covent Garden. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1811. An early interest in entomology provided his first paper (1812) but, on being persuaded that the study was cruel, he turned to other subjects. On his father's death in 1822 he became responsible for completing <span class="italic">The Genera of Recent and Fossil Shells</span> (1820&#150;22).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Shells in the &hellip; Tankerville Collection</span> (1825) influenced the illustration and nomenclature of conchology and helped to establish the first G. B. Sowerby's reputation in that field. His acquisition of the Tankerville collection in the 1820s, followed by the purchase of that of George Humphreys, caused him considerable financial embarrassment when the removal of import duty reduced the resale value of that stock. In a letter to Royer, in Paris, he wrote:<blockquote>I am at this moment in the midst of two enormous collections of Shells, Minerals and Fossils that I have purchased and actually know not which way to turn myself. I believe I shall go distracted unless I can find some person to assist me, or dispose of the whole concern together. (12 Oct 1824, G. B. Sowerby MS 208)</blockquote>These transactions marked the first G. B. Sowerby's entrance into the commercial market, which caused considerable anxiety to other dealers and later led to rivalry over the quality of shells that were used for illustrations.<br>
<br>Correspondence from 1822&#150;46 indicates the complexity of his dealings in shells, minerals, and fossils, as well as his role as a publisher and/or agent for other European dealers and publishers. His wide knowledge and good reputation meant that his opinion was frequently sought in making valuations. Between 1825 and 1830 he became involved with the <span class="italic">Zoological Journal</span>, a periodical dealing with new and exotic discoveries produced by a group of zoologists anxious to establish their own society, for which he wrote a succession of short papers on Mollusca. Further contributions were made to its successor, once the Zoological Society had been formed, and to other natural history periodicals.<br>
<br>In the 1830s, collaborating with his brothers, Sowerby tried numerous subscription schemes to raise finance (including an attempt to dispose of the Yorkshire meteorite in 1835) for a &#145;Sowerby Museum&#146;. He also founded the <span class="italic">Malacological and Conchological Magazine</span> and financed it for twelve months until it failed through lack of support. His own collection of natural history objects and stock of shells had to be sold by Thomas and Stevens on 27 May 1833.<br>
<br>Through his conchological reputation, Sowerby was involved in the description and illustration of recent and fossil molluscs collected on expeditions made during the late 1830s and 1840s (Beechey, 1839; Darwin, 1844; Strzelecki, 1845; and Adams, 1850). In particular he collaborated with Hugh Cuming in describing and marketing extensive collections from South America, but it was later realized that many &#145;new species&#146; were created solely as commercial opportunities.<br>
<br>In a sales leaflet (<i>c</i>.1841) &#145;GBS&#146; observed that his exertions for many years had been devoted to advance natural history, but that owing to ill health and with a numerous family, he now sought assistance from the &#145;Friends of science&#146; in order to continue. His health had been weakened by an inflammation of the lungs before 1811 and this condition was aggravated by the stress of a dealer's life. He died on 26 July 1854 at Hanley Road, Hornsey, London. Shortly before his own death, Gideon Mantell wrote, in his last journal entry (27 October 1852): &#145;Called on poor Mr. G. Sowerby, a decrepit and paralytic old man! and I remember my first interview with him at his father's when he was a laughing healthy youth&#151;life is a sad enigma&#146;  (G. Mantell, diary, Lewes, Sussex Archaeological Society).<br>
<br>The first G. B. Sowerby's oldest son, <a name="cosubject_26071"></a><span class="headword">George Brettingham Sowerby the second</span>  (1812&#150;1884), <span class="occ">conchologist and artist</span>, was born in Lambeth on 25 March 1812. He was probably educated at Harrow School and then assisted his father with publications and the natural history business. On 25 December 1835 he married Margaret Hitchen, the daughter of the Revd Thomas Hitchen.<br>
<br>He collaborated with his father in the production of <span class="italic">The Conchological Illustrations</span> (1841), a work that was initially intended to be a companion volume of coloured figures to a &#145;descriptive catalogue&#146; of hitherto unfigured shells described by J. E. Gray. He also published other significant conchological works with various members of the Sowerby family: <span class="italic">The Conchological Manual</span> (1839), <span class="italic">Thesaurus conchyliorum</span> (1848&#150;87), <span class="italic">Popular British Conchology</span> (1854), and <span class="italic">Illustrated Index of British Shells</span> (1859). He was persuaded to produce <span class="italic">The Popular History of the Aquarium</span> (1857) by Lovell Reeve, but not having the necessary knowledge he was criticized for incorporating material published by other authors and labelled as &#145;one of the greatest proficients in the art of &#147;scissors and paste&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</span>, 20, 1857, 139).<br>
<br>The second G. B. Sowerby is renowned for the illustrations he produced for the works of other specialists. A volume of drawings, <span class="italic">Palaeontology of the Vicinity of Cheltenham</span> (<i>c</i>.1844), showing fossils in the collection of Charles Fowler, suggests that he ought to be regarded as the most artistically talented of the Sowerbys. Crosse in a review  (Crosse, 260) commented that he was a mediocre naturalist, a shocking Latinist, but an excellent draughtsman and concluded &#145;Faites des planches, faites des planches &hellip; mais pour l'amour de Dieu ne d&eacute;criver point de coquille!&#146; (&#145;Make plates, make plates, &hellip; but for the love of God don't describe any shells!&#146;). Sowerby died at Wood Green on 26 July 1884.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26072"></a><span class="headword">Henry Sowerby</span>  (1825&#150;1891), <span class="occ">librarian and draughtsman</span>, the second son of G. B. Sowerby the first, was born in Kensington on 28 March 1825. He was educated at Bickerdike's School, Kentish Town, and then at University College, London. Between 1843 and 1853 he served part-time as assistant librarian to the Linnean Society. Later his carelessness as sub-curator was thought to have been partly responsible for &#145;serious injury&#146; to the collection of shells  (Gage, 128). During that period he published his only work <span class="italic">Popular Mineralogy</span> (1850) as one of Reeve's popular handbooks. In his preface, Henry Sowerby claimed that the plates were the first illustrations of minerals to be produced by lithography. On 21 April 1849 he married Annie Faulkner, daughter of Bridges Faulkner, merchant, and they had two children. In 1854 he went to Australia where he became a draughtsman at Melbourne University. After teaching drawing in various state schools he became occupied in gold mining for the last twenty years of his life. He died on 15 September 1891 in Daylesford, Victoria.<br>
