<span class="headword">Mapletoft,  Robert</span>  (1609&#150;1677), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 25 January 1609, at North Thoresby, Lincolnshire, the son of Hugh Mapletoft, rector of that parish, and his wife, a member of the Stennits family of Wainfleet, Lincolnshire. He was educated at the grammar school at Louth. He was admitted a sizar of Queens' College, Cambridge, on 25 May 1625, graduated BA in 1628, and proceeded MA in 1632. On 8 January 1631 he was elected fellow of Pembroke College and became chaplain to his friend and patron Bishop Matthew Wren. On Wren's recommendation, in 1639, the year he proceeded BD, he was presented to the rectory of Bartlow, Cambridgeshire, by Charles I.<br>
<br>Mapletoft was cousin to Nicholas Ferrar, whom he assisted with his translation of a temperance treatise by Leonard Lessius. He frequently wrote to and visited Ferrar's religious community at Little Gidding, Huntingdonshire. Mapletoft was there when Ferrar died in 1637; he preached the funeral oration and officiated at the funeral. His brother, Joshua, married Susanna Collett, Ferrar's niece, and was father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18018/', "John Mapletoft (1631&#150;1721)")</script>, the physician and clergyman.<br>
<br>During the civil war Mapletoft was among the fellows who unsuccessfully attempted to prevent William Dowsing, the iconoclast, from cleansing Pembroke College chapel. Mapletoft was ejected as a malignant from his living at Bartlow in 1643 and at the parliamentary visitation of the university in 1644. The charges against him included refusing the solemn league and covenant and permitting Bishop Wren's son to wear Prince Rupert's colours. He subsequently &#145;lived as privately and quietly as he could&#146;  (Baker MSS, CUL, MS 36, fol. 103) and was sheltered in Sir Robert Shirley's house in Leicestershire, where he met Gilbert Sheldon, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury. During the protectorate Mapletoft provided prayer book services to a private congregation in Lincoln. &#145;Being discovered, he was like to come into some trouble, but came off safe when it became known that his congregation had made a considerable purse for him, which he would not accept&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, on 28 July 1660 Mapletoft received the degree of DD by royal mandate. On 23 August he was presented by the crown to the subdeanery of Lincoln Cathedral and the prebendal stall of Clifton, and on 8 December revived the mastership of the Spital Hospital. While subdean he was involved with a dispute with the cathedral's precentor, John Featley, about capitular appointments, and was attacked by him in the manuscript tract &#145;Speculum Mapletofianum&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). As master of Spital Hospital he received the practically defunct charity with Dean Michael Honywood. A bill in chancery was exhibited in 1662 against Sir John Wray for the restoration of the estates, and Mapletoft at his own expense rebuilt the demolished chapel and increased its revenues, making the office rather one of expense than profit. He was nominated master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, but Mapletoft's recommended candidate, Mark Frank, served in the office until Mapletoft succeeded him, in 1664. He held the mastership until his death. He was made dean of Ely on 7 August 1667, holding the subdeanery of Lincoln with the deanery until 1671.<br>
<br>When in 1668 Anne Hyde, duchess of York, began to waver in her allegiance to the Church of England, Mapletoft was recommended as her chaplain by his friend Sheldon, as a &#145;primitive and apostolical divine&#146;  (Baker MSS, CUL, MS 36, fol. 103) whose influence might prevent her secession, but feeling himself &#145;unfit for court life&#146;  (Baker MSS, CUL, MS 38, fol. 191) he was reluctant to undertake the office. Shortly after resigning the subdeanery he moved to Cambridge, serving as vice-chancellor in 1671. He received from the crown the living of Clayworth, Nottinghamshire, which in 1672 he exchanged for the college living of Soham, near Ely, resigning his fellowship; he held the living of Soham until his death.<br>
<br>Mapletoft died, unmarried, on 20 August 1677 in the master's lodge at Pembroke, and, by his desire, was buried the same day in the chapel near Bishop Wren. It is recorded of him that &#145;wherever he resided he kept a good table, and had the general reputation of a pious and charitable man&#146;  (Baker MSS, CUL, MS 38, fol. 192). He was exceedingly thin, &#145;vir valde macilentus&#146;  (ibid.). In his will he made numerous bequests, including his library, the &#145;small reserves from the late plundering times&#146;  (Cambridge University Archives, will, vol. 4, 158), &pound;100 to Ely Cathedral, and the same sum to poor clerical widows in Ely. He also founded catechetical lectures at Queens' and Pembroke colleges, and petty schools at North Thoresby and at Louth.<br>
