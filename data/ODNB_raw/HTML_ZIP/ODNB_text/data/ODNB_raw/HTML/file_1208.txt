<span class="headword">Balliol <span class="st"> [Baliol]</span>,  John  de</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1208, <em>d.</em> 1268), <span class="occ">magnate and benefactor</span>, was the eldest son and heir of Hugh de Balliol (<i>d</i>. 1229), lord of Barnard Castle in co. Durham and of Bailleul-en-Vimeu in Picardy. Probably named after King John, to whom his father, exceptionally among the baronage of the north of England, had remained loyal, John was born some time before 1208, and succeeded to his patrimony on his father's death in 1229. Probably the single most decisive event in his long career, however, was his marriage in 1233 to Dervorguilla (<i>d</i>. 1290) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49378/', "Balliol, Dervorguilla de")</script>], third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49362/', "Alan")</script>, lord of Galloway, and the second daughter of his second marriage, to Margaret, daughter of David, earl of Huntingdon (<i>d</i>. 1219). In 1234 Dervorguilla's father died, and she and John inherited a third share of the Galloway lordship. Further substantial inheritances followed upon the deaths of Dervorguilla's maternal uncle, John (le Scot), earl of Huntingdon and Chester, and his widow, Helen, in 1237 and <i>c</i>.1253 respectively, and of her own elder sister, Christina (or Christiana), in 1246. By the middle of the thirteenth century Dervorguilla had thus brought considerable material wealth to her husband; hence Matthew Paris's contemporary reference to John de Balliol as &#145;rich and powerful&#146;, and to the &#145;money which he had in abundance&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 5.507, 528), a fact which did not escape Henry III's notice. This dramatic increase in wealth is particularly clearly expressed in the impressive architecture of mid- and later thirteenth-century date at Barnard Castle, the principal Balliol residence and stronghold in England, and at Buittle in Kirkcudbrightshire.<br>
<br>Judging by the frequency of his appearances in English government record from the mid-1240s onwards, this wealth also gave John de Balliol a platform for involvement in public life far beyond that of his predecessors. He was the first member of the family to be appointed as a sheriff, serving as sheriff of Cumberland and constable of Carlisle Castle between 1248 and 1255, and as sheriff of Nottingham and Derby between 1260 and 1264. In 1251 he assumed a prominent role on behalf of Henry III as joint protector of the young king of Scots, Alexander III, and his wife, Margaret, Henry's daughter; his role may have been largely nominal, however, and was certainly subordinate to that of his colleague, Robert de Ros (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1270) of Wark and Sanquhar, with whom he was removed from office in 1255. Between 1258 and 1265, throughout the course of the barons' wars, Balliol was usually to be found among Henry III's select group of counsellors, temporarily suffering forfeiture in 1263 and the effects of the king's defeat at Lewes in 1264. His cross-border landed interests led to his becoming a trusted envoy to Scotland and to France, where, remarkably, he retained possession of the Balliol patrimony, principally because his lands lay in the counties of Vimeu and Ponthieu in Picardy, outside the duchy of Normandy and thus not confiscated by the king of France in 1204.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his international responsibilities, it was a local problem which brought John de Balliol into conflict with his powerful neighbour, the bishop of Durham, and which led to his foundation of Balliol College, Oxford, the best-known memorial to the family name. The origins of the dispute lay in the homage and service for five and a quarter knights' fees held by the Balliols within the wapentake of Sadberge, especially their holdings in the vill of Long Newton. Sadberge, which incorporated part of the Balliol barony of Gainford, held in chief of the king since about 1093, had been purchased by Bishop Hugh du Puiset from Richard I, and since the last decade of the twelfth century had thus effectively become absorbed within the bishopric. In an agreement drawn up in 1231 John de Balliol acknowledged that the homage and service previously due to the king would be transferred to the bishop, but he evidently found difficulty in observing these terms.<br>
<br>A series of royal writs culminated in a letter of August 1255, in which Balliol was charged with the capture of the church of Long Newton, and with physical assault on the men of Bishop Walter Kirkham (<i>d</i>. 1260) by a group which included John's brothers Eustace and Jocelin; four of the bishop's men had been imprisoned at Barnard Castle. On this occasion agreement and redemption were secured. In an account in the <span class="italic">Chronicle of Lanercost</span>, John de Balliol is clearly identifiable as the anonymous baron of the bishopric of Durham who, having transgressed against the church, submitted himself to a public whipping by the bishop in front of the cathedral church door, and undertook to maintain scholars studying at Oxford. Some provision for the support of a house of scholars was made before his death in 1268, and further endowments were made in accordance with the terms of his will; these were brought together and the statutes of what became Balliol College were formulated in 1282 by his widow, Dervorguilla. The latter's uncommonly strong and romantic attachment to her husband was reflected in her foundation, in 1273, of the Cistercian abbey of Dulce Cor, or Sweetheart, in Galloway in memory of him. During her widowhood, she also had his embalmed heart set within an ivory casket always by her side, and, according to Andrew Wyntoun, she instructed that on her death it should be laid &#145;betwene hyr pappys twa&#146;  (Andrew of Wyntoun).<br>
<br>John de Balliol was the head of a family which was evidently both widely ramified and closely knit, acting in concert when occasion demanded, as the Long Newton episode in 1255 shows. The career of his second brother, Eustace, closely shadowed his own, including regular performance of royal service overseas, and a crucial period in office between 1261 and 1265 as sheriff of Cumberland and constable of Carlisle Castle. Married to an important Cumbrian heiress, Helewise of Levington, Eustace may also have been party to unrealized Balliol ambitions in north-western England, bridging the geographical gap between the lordships of Barnard Castle and Galloway. Of John's other brothers, Jocelin and Bernard were also in English royal service in the 1250s and early 1260s, and both benefited from John's marriage by acquiring lands in Scotland, in the Garioch and Berwickshire respectively. A fourth brother, Hugh, also appears fleetingly in Scotland, in Irvine on John's Cunningham estates in 1260, but is much more closely associated with the family's possessions in Picardy. John's only known sister was Ada, who married John Fitzrobert of Warkworth. One of their younger sons, Hugh de Eure or Iver, was executor, possibly principal executor, of John de Balliol's will, later serving as an envoy for his cousin, John, king of Scots.<br>
<br>John de Balliol died shortly before 27 October 1268. He and Dervorguilla had at least eight children. Three of their four sons survived to maturity and married within the social milieu of English earls and the English royal court&#151;a measure of the family's considerably expanded horizons. Hugh (<i>d</i>. 1271), the eldest son, married Agnes de Valence, daughter of the earl of Pembroke and niece of King Henry III; Alexander (<i>d</i>. 1278), the third son, married Ali&eacute;nor de Genoure, a kinswoman of Queen Eleanor; while John, the youngest son, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "John, king of Scots")</script>, married Isabel, second daughter of John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1304). The names and sequence of John and Dervorguilla's four daughters are uncertain, but they were probably Margaret, Cecily, Ada, and Eleanor, in that order. Margaret may have married into the Cumbrian family of Moulton; Cecily certainly married John de Burgh, grandson of the famous justiciar Hubert de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1243); Ada married William de Lindsay, heir to the lordships of Kendal and Lamberton (Berwickshire); and Eleanor married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6045/', "John Comyn (d. c.1302)")</script>, lord of Badenoch, justiciar of Galloway, and one of the guardians of Scotland. Through her, one of the most powerful political figures in Scotland became brother-in-law to the future King John.<br>
