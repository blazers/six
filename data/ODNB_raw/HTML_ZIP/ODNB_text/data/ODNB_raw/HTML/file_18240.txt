<span class="headword">Martyn,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1562, <em>d.</em> 1617), <span class="occ">lawyer and historian</span>, was baptized at St Petrock's, Exeter, on 19 September 1562, the eldest son of Nicholas Martyn (<i>d</i>. 1599) of Exeter and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1576), daughter of Lennard Yeo of Hatherleigh. After having been sent to the grammar school at Exeter, Martyn matriculated at Broadgates Hall (afterwards Pembroke College), Oxford, in the autumn of 1581. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 1 May 1582, and was called to the bar in 1589.<br>
<br>Martyn married at St Petrock's, on 28 November 1585, Susan, daughter of Thomas Prestwood of Exeter, with whom he had three sons, Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1654), William, and Edward, and one daughter, Susanna. He represented Exeter in the 1597&#150;8 parliament, and was its recorder from 1607 until his death. Susan Martyn died in January 1606, and Martyn then married Jane, daughter of Henry Huishe of Sands in Sidbury, Devon.<br>
<br>Martyn was the author of a work of morality (directed towards his son Nicholas) entitled <span class="italic">Youth's Instruction</span> (1612). He then turned to medieval history in <span class="italic">The historie, and lives, of the kings of England from William the Conqueror unto the end of the raigne of Henrie the Eight</span> (1615), containing preliminary verses from his three sons and his son-in-law and an appendix of &#145;succession of dukes and earles&#146; and other particulars. A second edition appeared in 1628, which was illustrated with portraits of the kings by R. Elstrack, most of which were sold by &#145;Compton Holland over against the Exchange&#146;. An enlarged third edition appeared in 1638 with lengthier lives of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. This was written by &#145;B. R., Master of arts&#146; who lifted his accounts nearly verbatim from William Camden's <span class="italic">Annales</span> and Francis Godwin's <span class="italic">Annales</span> of Edward and Mary.<br>
<br>Martyn's history reaches no further back than the Norman conquest, like many of his contemporary historians. Unlike Francis Bacon, Camden, John Hayward, and Samuel Daniel, however, his history is suffused by moral rather than political judgements (of the same flavour as his <span class="italic">Youth's Instruction</span>) which make it appear sententious. The sermonizing character of many of his verdicts on particular kings, especially the Scottish Stuarts, may have offended James I, who only a year earlier had caused Sir Walter Ralegh's <span class="italic">History of the World</span> to be called in. On 25 February 1615, barely a month after Martyn had dated the preface to his book, he was arrested and taken before the council. It fell to Bacon, a future historian himself and then attorney-general, to charge Martyn with having written a history with offensive passages. He was soon released, after apologizing, and returned to Exeter. Fuller's remark that the king forgot the offence seems correct since subsequent issues of the book were unaltered.<br>
<br>But the incident proved too much for Martyn, and he died at Exeter, having never recovered his &#145;former cheerfulnesse&#146; (Fuller, 1.306; Wood, 2.199), on 7 April 1617. He was buried on 12 April in St Petrock's Church. By his will, drawn up on 18 September 1610 and amended on the day of his death, he expressed assurance of salvation &#145;by a lively faith in Christ Jesus my Saviour and Redeemer&#146; and made provision for his wife and children, who survived him, from various properties in Devon  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/130, sig. 81).<br>
