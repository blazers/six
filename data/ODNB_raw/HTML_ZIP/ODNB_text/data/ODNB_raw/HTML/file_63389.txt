<span class="headword">Nance,  Robert Morton</span>  (1873&#150;1959), <span class="occ">Cornish-language scholar</span>, was born on 10 April 1873 at Clevedon Villa, The Walk, Tredegarville, Cardiff, the third of four children of William Edwin Nance (1857/8&#150;1932), coal agent and colliery manager, of Padstow, and his wife, Jane Morton of St Ives. He trained at Cardiff Art School and under Hubert Herkomer in Bushey, Hertfordshire. He married Beatrice (<i>b</i>. 1871/2), an artist, the daughter of Bolton Michell, gentleman, on 3 December 1895, and set up an art school in Wales. They had a daughter, but Beatrice died in 1900. On 27 March 1906 Nance married another artist, (Annie) Maud (1872&#150;1961), daughter of Richard Garnont Cawker, accountant, and moved to Nancledra in Cornwall, then, in 1914, to St Ives; they had two sons and another daughter.<br>
<br>Nance had a special interest in maritime subjects, earned a sound reputation in nautical history, illustrated books, and was a skilled model maker, with examples in various museums. He was a founder member of the Society for Nautical Research, and contributed over forty articles to the <span class="italic">Mariner's Mirror</span>. However, his principal claim to fame is his work in reviving Cornish, a native Celtic tongue not used as a spoken community language since the middle ages. The attempt was nostalgic and occasionally philologically questionable, but it was pursued with passion and meticulous attention to detail.<br>
<br>In Nancledra Nance wrote dialect plays, but, having begun to collect Cornish sea-words (his glossary was published posthumously), he took up Cornish proper. After the First World War, during which he was a volunteer, he set up, with the older scholar Henry Jenner (1848&#150;1934), the first Old Cornwall Society in St Ives in 1920. By 1924 there were enough societies to constitute a federation, with Jenner as president, succeeded by Nance. Although Jenner was never really as convinced about reviving spoken Cornish, the two established in 1928 the Gorseth Kernow, a version of the bardic gathering attached to the eisteddfod. The gorsedd is of dubious historicity, but its harmless eighteenth-century Romanticism helped raise the profile of Cornish. Jenner was the first grand bard, and Nance, who took the bardic name &#145;Mordon&#146; (&#145;Sea-wave&#146;), succeeded him in 1934, serving for twenty-five years. Nance was president of the Royal Institution of Cornwall in 1951&#150;5 and held other such positions, but most publicly available images show him in old age in bardic robes, angular and visionary.<br>
<br>Jenner had published a grammar, but Nance reconstructed Cornish for revival purposes. Feeling that there was insufficient material in late Cornish in the eighteenth century, he returned to the (still somewhat limited) medieval literature, standardizing spellings and calling his language &#145;unified Cornish&#146;. Deficient lexicon was remedied via Welsh and Breton, or with loans from Middle English or modern languages. The procedure was consistent enough, provided one accepted Nance's leap-frogging over late Cornish; not everyone did, sometimes dubbing his language &#145;Cornic&#146; or &#145;Mordonnek&#146; to distinguish it from genuine survivals. Nance's pronunciation system, based on phonetic representations of late Cornish and on the dialect of west Cornwall, was also criticized. But Nance was a popularizer and a pragmatist, providing a form in which the language <i>could</i> be learnt. In 1929 he produced <span class="italic">Cornish for All</span>, and in 1934 his first dictionary, with his close collaborator, A. S. D. Smith (1883&#150;1950); the two provided unified Cornish versions of the medieval texts with translations, as well as original material.<br>
<br>One aim of the Old Cornwall societies was to &#145;gather the fragments&#146;. Nance published more than two hundred articles in the journal <span class="italic">Old Cornwall</span> and elsewhere, many about Cornish domestic history, others linguistic, sometimes salvaging a coherent sentence of Cornish from a half-remembered scrap of apparent gibberish. In an original playlet (<span class="italic">An Balores</span>) written in 1932, Nance took the chough as emblem of the Cornish past, merging the bird with the spirit of King Arthur; a closing song contained the archetypally Romantic motto &#145;nyns-yu marow Myghtern Arthur&#146; (&#145;King Arthur is not dead&#146;).<br>
<br>The revival enjoyed success under Nance and Smith; unified Cornish was taught and examined, and works were written in it. After Nance's death its fortunes varied. School certificate examinations were abandoned in 1991 through shortage of numbers, although language boards in Cornwall maintain interest, as do groups in Australia and North America, and in 1999 parliament debated the status of the language within Europe. Against this, a proliferation of philologically more acceptable (but different) versions of unified Cornish, plus alternatives from different starting-points, led to severe linguistic schisms.<br>
<br>Nance translated some of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> for a service in 1933, but in a sense this was too late; the lack of a Cornish prayer book and <span class="roman">Bible</span> had contributed to the decline of spoken Cornish in Tudor times. Nor was the revived language strictly necessary, as in the case of modern Hebrew. However, contact with the past is always worthwhile; Nance was perhaps the last of the great Cornish antiquaries, and the continued awareness of the Cornish language is his legacy. Vigorous until the end (he was a non-smoking teetotaller and a vegetarian by conviction), Nance died in St Michael's Hospital, Hayle, on 27 May 1959, and was buried in Zennor church on 3 June; his memorial has a Cornish inscription.<br>
