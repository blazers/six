<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cook,  Frederick Charles</span>  (1804&#150;1889), <span class="occ">clergyman and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 1 December 1804 at Millbrook, near Southampton, Hampshire, the son of William Cook. He was admitted as a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, on 8 July 1824, and as a foundress scholar on 8 November 1825. In 1828 he took a first-class award in the classical tripos, and he graduated BA in 1831 and MA in 1844. He also studied under B. G. Niebuhr at Bonn, and became involved in a financially unsuccessful attempt at running a school near Paris. He then returned to England, where he was ordained deacon in the established church on 22 December 1839 and priest on 20 December 1840.<br>
<br>In 1841 Cook became secretary to the London diocesan board and an inspector of schools in London and Middlesex; on 31 January 1844 he became one of her majesty's inspectors of church schools. On 2 June 1846, at Brighton, he married Janet Barbara Sophia (Jessie) MacKenzie (1810&#150;1889), daughter of Alexander Douglas MacKenzie of Bursledon, Hampshire, and his wife, Sophia; they had no children. Cook was then living at St Michael, Highgate, in London. In 1849 he edited two poetry anthologies for schools, and in the following year his commentary on the book of <span class="roman">Acts</span> was published. On 30 June 1855 he was installed prebendary of Ealdstreet, in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>While in London Cook participated in an attempt at dialogue with representatives of the Eastern Orthodox church. On 30 March 1857 he was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria and on 14 September 1861 he became prebendary of Carlton-cum-Thurlby, in Lincoln Cathedral. On 13 February 1862 he was elected preacher at Lincoln's Inn: according to the obituary of Cook in <span class="italic">Notes and Gleanings</span>, E. B. Denison described him as the best preacher in England.<br>
<br>By 1863, following the unease caused by <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860) and by J. W. Colenso's ideas, it had occurred to J. E. Denison, speaker of the House of Commons, that the biblical questions raised should be answered by an authoritative commentary incorporating the church's traditional beliefs. This idea was eventually realized as <span class="italic">The Holy Bible &hellip; with &hellip; Commentary</span> (or <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span>, 10 vols., 1871&#150;81). In view of his knowledge of Hebrew and of the archaeology of the Holy Land, Cook was appointed general editor, &#145;the great work of his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Notes and Gleanings</span>), and wrote all or part of the commentary on <span class="roman">Job</span>, <span class="roman">Mark</span>, and six other books. Many felt that the learning displayed in the work was neutralized by its apologetic aim, and the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> section was severely criticized by Colenso and others.<br>
<br>In April 1864 Cook had been installed prebendary and canon residentiary of Exeter Cathedral, and in 1867, the better to tackle his work on the commentary, he was beginning to study Egyptian hieroglyphics. He was made precentor of Exeter Cathedral on 11 May 1872 and resigned the preachership at Lincoln's Inn in 1880 because of ill health. From then on Cook devoted himself largely to linguistic studies, but his deep misgivings about the Revised Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> led to four publications on the subject between 1881 and 1885. In <span class="italic">The Origins of Religion and Language</span> (1884) he propounded a primeval unity of language and belief among humanity.<br>
<br>Cook was a complete invalid during the last four years of his life, but he continued adding to his remarkable book collection, which he bequeathed to the Exeter chapter and which remains part of Exeter Cathedral Library. The collection contains works in many more than the fifty-two languages with which Cook was reportedly acquainted. Cook was also the author of several sermons, and he contributed to various books and periodicals on religious and linguistic subjects. A photograph, apparently taken when Cook was in his eighties, shows him with a generous growth of white hair and beard. Cook died at his house in Exeter Cathedral close on 22 June 1889 and was buried at the cemetery in St Thomas, near Exeter, Devon, on 26 June. His wife died three months later, on 5 October.<br>
<br>A conservative scholar of international repute, Cook was philanthropic, hospitable, and well liked, a Christian gentleman who used his gifts in the service of his faith and who came to represent a bygone age. One of the tributes to him claimed that he &#145;had done the work of at least a dozen men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Western Morning News</span>, 24 June 1889).<br>
