<span class="headword">White,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1428), <span class="occ">priest and Lollard heretic</span>, was of unknown origins. There is no indication of the date of his birth, and no clear evidence that he studied at a university. On 6 July 1422, described as a chaplain, he was brought before the convocation of Canterbury province at the summons of Archbishop Henry Chichele (<i>d</i>. 1443), accused of being strongly suspected of heresy, and of preaching in the parish church of Tenterden, Kent, without a licence. The proceedings revealed that he had already been imprisoned by the archbishop for the unlicensed preaching, and had been absolved by him from the excommunication incurred. He admitted the suspicion of heresy and abjured his errors. At some date he was allowed to return to Tenterden, as parish chaplain. His dissenting activities continued, principally in this same area of Kent, where he was a member, probably the leading figure, of a wide circle of Lollards. His activities were taken very seriously by Chichele. There are suggestions of a proposed Lollard uprising in the area in 1428 and White may have been one of the leaders, though this is hard to square with his subsequent profession of opposition to warfare. By 1426 at the latest he had also established himself as a Lollard evangelist in East Anglia. It would seem that he moved regularly between the two regions. He took as his wife a woman called Joan.<br>
<br>Lollardy was probably established to a limited extent in East Anglia before White's arrival there. However, he and others working together, including several from Kent, much reinforced and probably enlarged heresy in the region, mainly in an area around the Waveney valley along the Norfolk&#150;Suffolk boundary. He was a leading member of the group, possibly its dominant figure. As an itinerant teacher and evangelist he travelled round the houses of known Lollards, giving instruction and probably holding liturgical services in them. These &#145;schools and conventicles&#146; were conducted in English and contributed to the development of a Lollard vocabulary. The home in Loddon of Thomas Mone, a well-to-do shoemaker, and his vigorous wife, Hawise, provided one base for his operations, neighbouring Bergh Apton another. &#145;A great saint in heaven and a most holy doctor ordained and sent by God&#146; was how <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63489/', "Margery Baxter")</script> of Martham [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50538/', "Lollard women (act. c.1390&#150;c.1520)")</script>], another provider of hospitality, described him  (Tanner, 47). He wrote various books and tracts, though none of them survives.<br>
<br>When Archbishop Chichele sought to arrest suspected heretics in his diocese in the summer of 1428, White was among those who eluded his grasp, with the help of supporters like Baxter. Shortly afterwards, however, he was captured and brought to trial by the bishop of Norwich, William Alnwick (<i>d</i>. 1449). The trial, which took place in the chapel of the bishop's palace in Norwich on 13 September, was something of a show-piece, with numerous clerics in attendance, and it attests to his reputation. Thomas Netter (<i>d</i>. 1430), prior provincial of the English Carmelites, who was one of those present, described him as a &#145;great satrap&#146; and &#145;vassal&#146; of John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384), a &#145;doctor&#146; and &#145;great satellite&#146; of the Wycliffites  (Netter, <span class="italic">Doctrinale</span>, 3, cols. 412, 630, and 795&#150;6). He defended himself with honesty and subtlety, admitting some charges, denying some, and in other cases drawing distinctions. His beliefs lay on the more radical wing of Wycliffism and there is a force and originality of his own. He was forthright in his insistence on the right, indeed the advisability, of priests to marry. Regarding the eucharist, he denied transubstantiation and was accused of substituting for the mass a memorial service of Christ's passion presided over by a layman, a charge he denied. Notable too is the social content of his doctrine: he rejected capital punishment and the lawfulness of war.<br>
<br>The charges admitted by White were sufficient to secure his condemnation. As a relapsed heretic he was handed over to the civic authorities of Norwich for punishment. Accordingly, shortly afterwards, he was executed in the city by being burnt at the stake, together with his Lollard colleagues Hugh Pye, formerly chaplain of Loddon, and the layman John (or William) Waddon, who had been condemned in separate trials somewhat earlier. Margery Baxter, who was present at his execution, said that he tried to preach to the people as he was about to be put to death, but one of the bishop's officials struck him on the mouth to prevent this.<br>
<br>White was a major figure in early fifteenth-century Lollardy. His influence may have spread wider than Kent and East Anglia, though there is no clear evidence to this effect. Links with the west country, for example, were quite possibly made through a priest called Thomas Bikenore and his written works may have had a wide circulation. In East Anglia his impact was striking, though his teachings lost some of their refinement when received by less educated people. To what extent it persisted after the prosecutions conducted by Bishop Alnwick in the diocese of Norwich between 1428 and 1431 is unclear. In the Tenterden area of Kent, too, his influence was marked. In this case, however, current knowledge of well-established Lollard communities in the same area in the early sixteenth century provides stronger evidence that his memory endured.<br>
