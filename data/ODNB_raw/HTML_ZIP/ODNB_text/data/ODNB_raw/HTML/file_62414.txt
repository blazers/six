<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooke,  Alice Margaret</span>  (1867&#150;1940), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at 24 Boston Street, Hulme, Lancashire, on 18 September 1867, the daughter of John Cooke, a cotton yarn agent, and his wife, Eliza Anderson Jackson. She attended a private school in Manchester and then, from 1883 to 1887, Manchester High School for Girls (Girls' Public Day School Trust), where she was first inspired to become a historian. A classmate remembered her as &#145;a hard worker, very earnest and conscientious, and already rather academic, with eyes set on her goal&#146;  (Horner and Haworth, 1). Because her parents did not want her to leave home, in 1887 she entered Victoria University of Manchester (Owens College), which had been open to women only since 1883. There she was an excellent student, earning the Bradford history scholarship in 1888 and a first-class honours degree in history in 1890. In that year she became the first woman to be awarded the Jones fellowship, the highest distinction in history conferred by the college. The fellowship enabled her to pursue her love of medieval history, leading to the publication of &#145;The settlement of the Cistercians in England&#146; in the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> (1893), which was for long the standard account of these early monastic foundations.<br>
<br>In 1893 Cooke received the MA degree, the first to be awarded to a woman at Owens College, and became the first woman to be appointed a lecturer there. She was one of the first women appointed to a university-level academic post in Britain. At that time, provision for women students at Owens College was limited. As well as teaching she served as assistant tutor to women students from 1897 to 1901; in this capacity she raised money for a new women's union and was one of the founders and joint honorary secretary of Ashburne Hall, the first hall of residence for women at Owens, and she served as chairman of the women's athletic union. In 1897 she was elected a member of the court of governors of Victoria University. She lectured for university extension, supported the Manchester University settlement, and worked for the cause of women's suffrage. Furthermore, during this period she was invited by her friend Mrs Rylands to compile a catalogue of Earl Spencer's Althorp Library, which became the nucleus of the John Rylands Library, University of Manchester. She was also fond of cycling and travel.<br>
<br>From 1901 to 1903 Cooke was lecturer in history and head of the Aberdare hall of residence for women students at the University of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff. In 1903 she became the first woman entrusted with librarian's work at the Cambridge University Library, where she was invited to catalogue Lord Acton's library, a historical collection of 60,000 to 70,000 volumes. In Cambridge she lived on Clare Road near Newnham College, where she taught modern history from 1905 to 1907.<br>
<br>In 1907 Alice Cooke was appointed lecturer in history at Leeds University, where she was chosen over the young F. M. Powicke, later regius professor of modern history at Oxford. At Leeds, where she was appointed reader in 1919, she established the department of medieval history and played an important role in strengthening the library's medieval collections. During the First World War she patrolled the streets of Leeds by night as a policewoman, which may have contributed to a breakdown in her health in 1920.<br>
<br>After two years recuperating at home in Manchester, Cooke returned to Cambridge as director of studies in history at Newnham College, where she remained until her retirement in 1927. After her retirement she lived in Cambridge with Lena Ward, the daughter of her old friend Sir Adolphus Ward. Cooke was fond of Cambridge, but her health remained poor, and in 1934 she became a complete invalid after an accident. She was able to retire to Manchester, where, although not a Roman Catholic herself, she was taken in by a community of Catholic nuns, who cared for her until her death, at St Joseph's Hospital, Carlton Road, Whalley Range, Manchester, on 26 January 1940.<br>
<br>Because of her teaching responsibilities and poor health, Alice Cooke was not able to devote as much time to historical research as she might have wished. Nevertheless, as well as her seminal article on the Cistercians, she wrote forty articles on medieval history, beginning with the letter N, for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and made several indexes to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span>. In 1901 the Chetham Society published her edition of the manuscript &#145;Visitationes B.M.V. de Whalley&#146;. While at Leeds she was commissioned to write the chapter on monasticism for the <span class="italic">Cambridge Medieval History</span>, but was unable to complete it because of illness; it was eventually published as &#145;A study in twelfth century religious revival and reform&#146; in the <span class="italic">John Rylands Library Bulletin</span> (January 1925). After a trip to Assisi in 1909 Alice Cooke had become fascinated by St Francis, and published &#145;St. Francis of Assisi&#146; in the <span class="italic">Church Quarterly Review</span> in October 1929. Her greatest contribution, however, was probably as a pioneer in women's education in her native Manchester and as a teacher. A former student at Leeds University recalled that Alice Cooke had &#145;acquired something of the saintliness and humility and the sublime joy of the early Franciscans, and was able to communicate a measure of this to her pupils&#146;  (Horner, 43).<br>
