<span class="headword">Wyatt,  Lewis William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1777, <em>d.</em> 1853), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized on 25 August 1777 in Weeford, Staffordshire, the second of the four sons of Benjamin Wyatt (1745&#150;1818), land surveyor and occasional architect, of Weeford, later agent to the Penrhyn estate, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of William Ford, brewer, of Burton upon Trent. From 1795 to 1800 he was apprenticed to his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38159/', "Samuel Wyatt")</script>, during which time (in 1797) he started exhibiting at the Royal Academy. In the beginnings of his career he was indebted in different ways to both Samuel and his other architect uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30105/', "James Wyatt")</script>. In 1800 he became assistant to the latter, who at the same time gave him a post in the office of works as labourer in trust at Carlton House and also employed him in connection with his work as surveyor of the ordnance; his first recorded works&#151;minor country-house commissions in Staffordshire (1803&#150;5)&#151;were designed in James's office for execution by the Wyatt family building business; and in 1805 he submitted designs for Downing College, Cambridge, after those by James had been severely criticized by Thomas Hope, perhaps in an attempt to salvage the commission for the family. Then, after setting up in practice on his own <i>c</i>.1806, he was employed at Heaton Hall, Lancashire, where both James and Samuel had worked previously; and on Samuel's death in 1807 he completed two of his commissions, Tatton Park, Cheshire, and Hackwood Park, Hampshire, and in effect succeeded to his practice in the Cheshire area.<br>
<br>Wyatt's subsequent work was primarily as a country-house architect and &#145;improver&#146;, although he competed unsuccessfully for a number of major public commissions and in 1816 published <span class="italic">A Prospectus of a Design for Various Improvements in the Metropolis</span>, in which he made radical proposals for replanning the West End. In 1813, however, he succeeded James Wyatt as architect to the Middlesex Hospital, a post he held until 1829, and he also made some further progress in the office of works: in 1818 he was promoted to the clerkship of the works for the eastern division, before transferring in 1829 to Hampton Court, but he then lost his position in the reorganization of the office in 1832. In 1815 he visited Paris, in 1820 he made a six months' visit to Italy, and in 1825 he was in Paris again, having been sent to supervise repairs at the British embassy.<br>
<br>The predominant feature of Wyatt's architecture is a marked stylistic eclecticism. A number of works, including his finest, Willey Hall, Shropshire (1813&#150;15), are in a monumental neo-classical manner developed from the late work of his uncles Samuel and James; at Cuerden Hall, Lancashire (1815), he experimented with a &#145;picturesque classicist&#146; mode reminiscent in part of the work of Sir John Vanbrugh and in part of the contemporary &#145;primitivist&#146; idiom; while at Cranage Hall, Cheshire (1828&#150;9), he used the Tudor style and at Sherborne House, Gloucestershire (1829&#150;34), produced a convincing copy of an Elizabethan design. Similarly skilful pastiches of interior decorative styles included work at Hackwood (1807&#150;13) and Lyme Park, Cheshire (1814&#150;17), in an English late seventeenth-century manner, and at Hawkstone Hall, Shropshire (1832&#150;4), and elsewhere in the Louis XIV mode particularly associated with his cousins <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30101/', "Benjamin Dean Wyatt")</script> and Philip Wyatt.<br>
<br>The death of his father in 1818 left Wyatt quite a wealthy man, able to indulge a taste for connoisseurship and collecting works of art. He married late in life, and in 1833 his wife, Louisa Wyatt, a cousin, died in childbirth (the baby also died). About two years after this tragedy and after a series of professional reverses, notably the discovery of defective work at Sherborne House, which led to a costly negligence award against him, Wyatt gave up architectural practice. He then retired to a small property near Ryde on the Isle of Wight, where he spent his later years carrying out improvements to the grounds and where he died on 14 February 1853.<br>
