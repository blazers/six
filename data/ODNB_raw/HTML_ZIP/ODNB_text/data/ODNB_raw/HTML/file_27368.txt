<span class="headword">Thornycroft <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Francis]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1809&#150;1895), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, born at Thornham, Norfolk, and baptized on 24 December 1809 at Redruth, Cornwall, was the third daughter of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10074/', "John Francis (1780&#150;1861)")</script>, sculptor, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Nelson?), though she told her husband and children that she was born in 1814. In 1823 the Francis family settled at 56 Albany Street in London, where John Francis ran a sculpture studio with assistants and pupils, among them his daughter, Mary. In 1835 Mary Francis made her d&eacute;but at the Royal Academy with her <span class="italic">Bust of a Gentleman</span>. In the same year <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27369/', "Thomas Thornycroft (1815&#150;1885)")</script> of Chiswick, Middlesex, came to the Albany Street household and studio to be apprenticed to John Francis. Five years later, on 29 February 1840, he married Mary. Of their six surviving children, four studied at the Royal Academy Schools: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36513/', "Sir (William) Hamo Thornycroft (1850&#150;1925)")</script> became a sculptor and member of the Royal Academy, (Mary) Alyce Thornycroft (1844&#150;1906) was a sculptor and painter, and Helen Thornycroft (1848&#150;1937) and Theresa Thornycroft (1853&#150;1947) were both painters. The first-born son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36512/', "Sir John Isaac Thornycroft (1843&#150;1928)")</script>, became a naval architect, and Frances (Fanny) Thornycroft (1846&#150;1929) married John Donaldson of her brother's engineering firm. Both Fanny and Hamo had children and grandchildren who became artists as well.<br>
<br>Ideal works of children and portraits in a neo-classically inspired, Romantic style predominate in Mary Thornycroft's <i>&#339;uvre</i>. She exhibited regularly at both the Royal Academy (1835&#150;77) and the British Institution (1845&#150;64) but is best-known for her work for the royal family. Her works in the Royal Collection exemplify the salient features of her style: a highly naturalistic rendering of human form and movement with crisp and detailed carving of surfaces. Her works are by no means radical or unusual for her period, but they manifest a virtuosity in modelling, proportion, and design which is strikingly successful in reconciling the sometimes conflicting nineteenth-century allegiances to classicism and naturalism. Although consistent with the idealizing tendencies of sculpture in the period, her portraits retain a high degree of likeness, as seen, for example, in her bust of <span class="italic">Mary, Duchess of Gloucester</span> (1852, Royal Collection, Frogmore House, Windsor). Her allegorical statues of the royal children are similarly closely observed and modelled in an unobtrusive style which manages to be both realistic and ideal.<br>
<br>Some accounts credit the sculptor John Gibson with launching Mary Thornycroft's career as a court sculptor by recommending her to produce portrait statues of the royal children. However, Mary's father had established a connection with Queen Victoria when he was commissioned to sculpt a bust of her about 1838, and Mary herself had already achieved critical acclaim in 1838&#150;40 for her ideal marble <span class="italic">Orphan Flower Girl</span>, exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution (called <span class="italic">Orphan Girl</span> when exhibited in plaster initially at the RA in 1838). Thus, she may have been known to the queen and Prince Albert as a sculptor of children before she and her husband became friendly with Gibson during their sojourn in Rome from 2 December 1842 to 26 April 1843. While in Rome, having left their first-born child, Ann (1841&#150;1858), in the care of Thomas's mother in England, Mary Thornycroft not only gave birth to her second child, John, on 1 February 1843, but also sculpted a marble statue of a sleeping child watched over by a spaniel (priv. coll.)&#151;another work which could have recommended her ability in portraying children to Gibson.<br>
<br>Mary Thornycroft's first work for the royal family was a statue of Princess Alice in 1845, which the sculptor soon adapted for an allegorical series, produced between 1846 and 1848, representing the eldest royal children as the four seasons. Various versions of these figures were produced in marble, bronze, and statuary porcelain for the royal collections at Osborne House and Buckingham Palace (exh. RA, 1850; British Institution, 1851; Great Exhibition, London, 1851). Further marble statues for Osborne House of Princess Helena as <span class="italic">Peace</span> (1856), Princess Louise as <span class="italic">Plenty</span> (1856), <span class="italic">Princess Beatrice in a Nautilus Shell</span> (1858), the prince of Wales as a hunter (1860), and Prince Leopold as a fisher (1860) followed, as well as numerous busts and statues of four generations of the royal family. Many of these were reviewed in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, accompanied by engraved reproductions. Reduced-scale Parian versions of her bust of Alexandra, princess of Wales, were Art Union of London prizes in 1863&#150;4. From this same period came her <span class="italic">Skipping Girl</span>, shown at the Paris Exhibition in 1855 (exh. RA, 1856 and 1867; British Institution, 1857; Parian version exh. Universal International Exhibition, London, 1862; Osborne House, Isle of Wight), and reportedly praised by the Danish sculptor J. A. Jerichau as &#145;one of six of the finest statues in the world&#146; for its precisely balanced, light, and energetic rendering of the child in mid-skip  (<span class="italic">The Queen</span>, 16 Feb 1895). Tragedy followed shortly thereafter, however, when in 1858 her daughter Ann died of tuberculosis; <span class="italic">Jephthah's Daughter</span> (exh. British Institution, 1858), sculpted in that year, was perhaps the artist's response to her loss.<br>
<br>Mary Thornycroft's steady income from portrait and royal commissions was the mainstay of the Thornycroft family, as Thomas did not enjoy such regular demand for his sculpture. Professional insecurity seems to have incited Thomas in letters to his patron, W. B. Dickinson, to promote his role in the production of Mary's works to the point of implying his own authorship of them. Their granddaughter, Mary Donaldson, recounts that Thomas Thornycroft had been known to cut the heads off Mary's clay models, ostensibly to position them better, but provoking exasperated cries of &#145;Only <i>tell</i> me! Thorny, only <i>tell</i> me!&#146; from his wife as she tried to protect her works  (Manning, <span class="italic">Bronze and Steel</span>, 51&#150;2). The Thornycrofts did, however, collaborate on large sculptural projects. Thomas Thornycroft did much of the carving of the numerous works and replicas ordered from Mary's royal commissions; he wrote in 1861 that: &#145;We have executed in Bronze or Marble for the Queen not less than thirty original works not counting minor commissions of copies in plaster&#146;  (Thomas Thornycroft MSS, letter TTC161). Together the couple produced the funerary portrait of the child John Hamilton-Martin (<i>d</i>. 1851), completed in 1857 for Ledbury church in Herefordshire, and there is some suggestion that they collaborated on the statues of James I and Charles I for the houses of parliament (now in the central criminal court of the Old Bailey). Later the entire Thornycroft coterie participated in realizing two of Thomas's major works: <span class="italic">The Poet's Fountain</span> (1871&#150;5, formerly Park Lane, London; destroyed) and the <span class="italic">Boadicea</span> group (begun 1856; erected 1902, Westminster Bridge, London).<br>
<br>Mary Thornycroft's letters to her children are replete with words of encouragement for their artistic careers. In addition to teaching her children, she was engaged by Queen Victoria to instruct the royal princesses in modelling; of them, Princess Louise went on to work as a sculptor in her own right. After a short illness, Mary Thornycroft died on 1 February 1895 and was buried in Chiswick churchyard at her husband's side as she requested, &#145;within sound of the hammers&#146;  (Manning, <span class="italic">Bronze and Steel</span>, 70).<br>
