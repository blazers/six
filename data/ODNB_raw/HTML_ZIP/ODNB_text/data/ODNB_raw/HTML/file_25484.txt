<span class="headword">Shute,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1557&#150;1598), <span class="occ">translator and soldier</span>, is of unknown origins. His first translation from the Italian, <span class="italic">Two very notable commentaries, the one of the originall of the Turcks and empire of the house of Ottomano, written by Andrew Cambini and the other of the warres of the Turke against George Scanderbeg, prince of Epiro</span> was published in 1562. It was dedicated to his singular good lord and master Sir Edward Fynes, Lord Clinton, high admiral of England and Ireland. This suggests that he was the Captain John Shute who was included in the list of names of the lords and gentlemen who attended Clinton to France in 1557. Clinton became governor of the Tower of London in 1553 and Shute was made a gunner of the Tower of London and yeoman of the ordnance for life in 1569. In his dedicatory epistle to Clinton, Shute promotes the idea that a trained, skilful, and fit soldier was better than an untrained man. Shute uses examples from classical literature to reinforce this. He apologizes to the reader for the roughness of the translation, as he had not been brought up in schools. He added a table of contents and marginalia to the original.<br>
<br>Shute's <span class="italic">The firste parte of the Christian instruction and generall some of the doctrine, conteyned in holy scriptures</span>, translated from the French of Peter Viret and published in 1565, was dedicated to the earl of Leicester by &#145;a simple solider, better practised abroad in martial arts than furnished at home with the cunning of the school&#146;. A continuation of <span class="italic">Christian Instruction</span> was translated and published in 1573 dedicated to Clinton's wife, Elizabeth, countess of Lincoln. Another translation of a work by Viret, <span class="italic">The principal points which at this day are in controversie concerning the holy supper of Jesus Christ, and the mass of the Roman Church</span> (1579), was dedicated to Sir Francis Walsingham. Shute had been connected with Walsingham from December 1573 to January 1574 when he travelled to Lowestoft in Suffolk to view soldiers returned from Holland with captains Bingen and Morgan, for which he was paid &pound;10. During the Armada scare of 1587&#150;8 Shute raised 2000 footmen and 200 horse from Surrey and Sussex, receiving &pound;20 for this. He had retired from the post of yeoman of the ordnance by 1600 as a letter from his successor dated in that year says that as a yeoman Shute had refused to conduct the ordnance from place to place on the grounds that he was a leader of men not of carts. Shute had been given a pension by Bishop Horne of Winchester. In 1598 Shute had to write to Sir Robert Cecil to ask for his intercession in getting the pension paid. When Cecil had arranged this Shute wrote him a note of thanks. This is Shute's last appearance in the records.<br>
