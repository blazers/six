<span class="headword">Buckman,  Sydney Savory</span>  (1860&#150;1929), <span class="occ">geologist and palaeontologist</span>, was born on 3 April 1860 at Dollar Street, Cirencester, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3871/', "James Buckman (1814&#150;1884)")</script>, naturalist, and his wife, Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Savory (1834&#150;1865). After his father lost his job as professor of botany and geology at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, in 1863, the family moved to Bradford Abbas, Dorset, one of the most richly fossiliferous districts in the world. His mother died two years later; thus Buckman's main influences were his naturalist father and Dorset's palaeontological riches.<br>
<br>Between 1871 and 1879 Buckman attended Sherborne School. In 1877, while still at Sherborne, he read a paper on fossil <i>Astarte (Bivalvia)</i> to the Dorset Field Club. The paper was awarded the club's prize, and was published in 1878. First intentions were that Buckman should enter the church, but with the encouragement of his grandfather John Savory (1800&#150;1871), a London pharmaceutical chemist, Buckman set off in 1879 to study at the Chemischen Laboratoriums, run by the Fresenius family in Wiesbaden, Germany. However, the following year Buckman returned to England, where he spent the next two years studying to become a land agent under one of his father's former students, Robert Holland (1829&#150;1893), estate agent of Norton Hill and Mobberley, Cheshire. The two years were also spent courting Holland's daughter, Maude Mary (1860&#150;1946), whom Buckman married on 14 June 1882.<br>
<br>In 1881 Buckman published his first paper in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span>. In it he disagreed with his father's views about the age of sands at Yeovil and the value of fossil &#145;zones&#146; in dating such rocks. The following year he was elected fellow of the Geological Society. It was also in 1882 that Buckman began farming at Upper Hampden, Gloucestershire, a profession he abandoned in March 1886 after being defeated by the great agricultural depression. He now started a new, but precarious, career as a novelist, commercial writer, and dealer in fossils, in order to support his scientific work on Jurassic rocks.<br>
<br>Buckman started work on a Palaeontographical Society monograph on the ammonites of the Inferior Oolite in 1887. In 1889 the first of his critically important papers was published, demonstrating that southern English sands of Toarcian to Aalenian age were diachronous. It remains the classic demonstration of this phenomenon, where identical strata distinguished by their fossil assemblages differ in age from place to place. In 1893 his paper on the subdivision and detailed dating of the Inferior Oolite of Dorset followed. This broke new ground in showing how precisely such condensed and eroded rocks could be subdivided, and how necessary it was to separate the stratal record from the chronological. Buckman was the first to show how precisely time could be revealed from fossils. The first of his pioneering studies of homeomorphy in brachiopods followed in 1901.<br>
<br>In 1904 Buckman suffered a breakdown in health, caused by over-exertion as a cycling geologist. He moved to Thame, Oxfordshire, in order to be closer to scientists based in London and Oxford. However, the move brought a loss of contact with the fieldwork which had been so critical to the quality of his work earlier. This, and the ever-increasing multiplicity of names he was giving to ammonites, caused the council of the Palaeontographical Society to abandon his monograph in 1907. In 1909 he commenced publication of <span class="italic">Type Ammonites</span>, initially those from Yorkshire, as a private venture without interference from referees. The work reached seven volumes by the time of his death.<br>
<br>Buckman's scientific work before 1904 was of a quality quite unequalled for its time, but its worth has only recently become clear. His later work, as an early and &#145;consultant palaeontologist&#146; largely outside government or academic circles, was done in too much isolation from other professional scientists. Buckman was a man of extraordinary breadth, a good linguist, and much interested in political and social reform, having been an advocate of &#145;rational dress&#146; for women cyclists. In 1910 he published his minor, if forgotten, classic, <span class="italic">Marriage, Mating and the Status of Women</span>.<br>
<br>Buckman's work polarized geological opinion, but he was awarded the Lyell medal of the London Geological Society in 1913. In 1914, now busy as a consultant, he was offered a post with the Geological Survey of Canada, but the First World War prevented his appointment. Buckman died at his home, Southfield, Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, on 26 February 1929. He left only &pound;1474 and asked to be cremated, with no religious service of any kind. In 1930 his widow was awarded a civil-list pension for his services to geology. In 1933 his ashes were spread over Thorncombe Beacon, Dorset.<br>
