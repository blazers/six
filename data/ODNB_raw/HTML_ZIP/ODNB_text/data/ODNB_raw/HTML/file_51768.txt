<span class="headword">Mackinnon,  Doris Livingstone</span>  (1883&#150;1956), <span class="occ">protozoologist</span>, was born on 30 September 1883 at 4 Forest Road, Aberdeen, the eldest of five children of Lachlan Mackinnon (1855&#150;1948), advocate and consular agent for France and Belgium, and his wife, Theodora Thompson of London. Her interest in science was stimulated by her father (an amateur ornithologist, botanist, and astronomer) and by her acquaintance with the geologist Maria Ogilvie Gordon, who encouraged her to study science seriously. Mackinnon graduated BSc from Aberdeen University in 1906, at a time when few women were studying science. She gained a special distinction in botany and geology, and submitted her thesis &#145;Studies on protozoa&#146; for the degree of DSc in 1914. She was awarded an honorary LLD by the university in 1943.<br>
<br>After graduation Mackinnon received a Carnegie scholarship and spent a year in the laboratory of Richard Hertwig in Munich. She also spent a few months at the biological station at Roscoff in Brittany (where she worked on protozoological research with M. F. Vl&egrave;s) and at the Quick Laboratory in Cambridge&#151;under the supervision of Professor G. H. F. Nuttall. In 1908 Mackinnon returned to Aberdeen as personal assistant to Professor J. Arthur Thomson at the university; she collaborated with him on several papers. In 1909 she moved to Dundee as assistant to Professor W. D'Arcy Thompson; she was promoted to lecturer in 1916. It was at University College, Dundee, that Mackinnon gained her reputation as a brilliant lecturer and protozoologist specializing in the parasites of insects.<br>
<br>In 1916 Mackinnon was introduced to the study of amoebic dysentery by Clifford Dobell. From then, until 1918, she took a leave of absence to do war work as a protozoologist in military hospitals, including the 1st Western General Hospital, Liverpool, and University War Hospital, Southampton. During this period she published several papers and reports with colleagues concerning <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> (the bacteria responsible for amoebic dysentery in humans). She returned to Dundee in 1918, where, for some months, she ran the zoology department single-handedly, D'Arcy Thompson having accepted a position at St Andrews. In 1919 she was appointed lecturer in zoology at King's College, University of London, later being promoted to reader (1921) and professor (1927). Mackinnon remained at King's until her retirement in 1949, at which time she was elected an emeritus professor and an honorary research associate of University College, London.<br>
<br>Doris Mackinnon was the author of about forty scientific papers, chiefly on parasitic protozoa. A talented writer and artist, with a good knowledge of German and music, she brought a wide perspective to her writing and teaching. While in Dundee she often lectured for a popular audience, as well as publishing a series of articles about children and childhood memories in periodicals and in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. Later she gave a course of broadcast talks for schools which formed the basis of her book <span class="italic">The Animal's World</span> (1936), a revised and expanded edition of which was published in 1950. Her early training in German enabled her to produce in 1926 a translation of Jacob von Uexk&uuml;ll's <span class="italic">Theoretische Biologie</span> and, three years later, of Paul Mies's <span class="italic">Die Bedeutung der Skizzen Beethovens zur Erkenntnis seines Stiles</span> (as <span class="italic">Beethoven's Sketches: an Analysis of his Style, Based on his Sketchbook</span>). Her artistic ability is suggested by her illustrations of specimens. Doris Mackinnon was remembered as an outstanding lecturer who never repeated a lecture in thirty years of teaching. Her colleague Ben Dawes wrote that she was<blockquote>an inspiring teacher, rapid but always lucid in exposition, she had a natural dignity and touch of the grand manner which at all times commanded respect and attention and which could, on occasions, give devastating force to a well deserved reprimand. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>)</blockquote>Doris Mackinnon corresponded with many of her students after graduation, offering them advice and guidance in their careers. During the Second World War she sent news and gifts of books to those who were serving abroad. Following her retirement she began work on a textbook for undergraduates. Frequently interrupted by illness, in the spring of 1956 she invited R. S. J. Hawes of University College, London, to collaborate with her. In that June, however, she suffered a severe stroke, and died at her Chelsea home, 44 St Leonard's Terrace, three months later, on 10 September 1956. <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Protozoa</span>, which was edited and completed by Hawes, was published in 1961.<br>
