<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Poor <span class="st"> [Poore]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1237), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23515/', "Richard of Ilchester")</script>, sometimes called Le Poer, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1188). His mother's name is not recorded, nor is it known exactly when he was born. He was granted papal dispensation to hold a plurality of benefices despite his illegitimacy in 1206, but he had gained ecclesiastical preferment by the 1190s, and a date of birth in the mid-twelfth century seems probable. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22524/', "Herbert Poor")</script>, also rose in the church to the rank of bishop, at Salisbury. Both brothers were left land by their father, in Winchester, Hampshire, and in London. Richard attended the University of Paris, where he was a pupil of Stephen Langton, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1226). Later, as an exile in France during the interdict, with Hugh of Wells, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1235), and Jocelin of Wells, bishop of Bath (<i>d</i>. 1242), he returned to Paris, where he taught theology until his return to England.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareer"></a>Political career</h2>Richard Poor was a member of a curial family; his father was first recorded in the royal service in 1156 and worked both as a royal justice and within the exchequer. Richard had been appointed as one of the executors of King John, although this was probably an honorary position, and like his father he acted as a justice itinerant, visiting Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Hampshire in 1218&#150;19. However, he was most active at court between 1223 and 1232, in the period of Hubert de Burgh's rise to power and Archbishop Stephen Langton's prominence. In 1223 Peter des Roches (<i>d</i>. 1238), Ranulf (III), earl of Chester (<i>d</i>. 1232), and Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; (<i>d</i>. 1226) fell from power, and Hubert de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1243), Richard Poor, and Bishop Jocelin of Bath, with the support of Langton, formed what was in practice a new government. These four men were responsible for the deprivation of Br&eacute;aut&eacute; and many others who in 1223 refused to accept papal letters declaring the young Henry III able to control the government of the kingdom and granting him control of his castles and the royal seal. In 1224 it was Poor who replaced Peter des Roches as castellan of Winchester, Portchester, and Southampton. The same four men brought about a reconciliation between the king and his opponents later that year, possibly to prevent the dispatch of a papal envoy to England. In 1225 Poor was given responsibility for one of the two special exchequers set up to administer that year's fifteenth on movables. In 1228, when he became bishop of Durham, Richard Poor withdrew from the court. However, he was affected by the events of 1232&#150;4, the years when Peter des Roches's influence revived following the disgrace of Hubert de Burgh. In December 1232 Poor and the bishop of Bath were questioned concerning the collection of the fifteenth of 1225, as part of an offensive against Walter Mauclerc's administration of the treasury, and from then until February 1233 both men worked in the exchequer. But thereafter Poor was rarely at court, being forced, like many of his episcopal colleagues, into opposition by des Roches's conduct of affairs.<h2>
<a name="Reformingbishop"></a>Reforming bishop</h2>It was as a churchman, however, not a courtier that Richard Poor made his greatest mark. His rise within the church was swift, aided by the power and influence of his relatives. After his brother Herbert was made bishop of Salisbury in 1194, Richard was appointed archdeacon of Dorset, and in 1197 dean of Salisbury, a post he held until his election to the see of Chichester. During this period he held the prebend of Charminster and Bere. Attempts to elect him bishop of Winchester in 1205, at the urging of his father's connections, and bishop of Durham in 1213, both failed. Matthew Paris described Poor as a man of both unparalleled piety and profound learning, and during these years he did not neglect his intellectual gifts. He was responsible for the completion of Osmund's <span class="italic">Institutio</span>, which set out the duties and privileges of senior members of the cathedral chapter at Salisbury. It is also probable that he compiled the <span class="italic">Ordinale</span>, which summarized custom concerning the conduct of services and provided a general framework for the use of specific service books. He followed this, about 1210, with the <span class="italic">Consuetudinarium</span>, which provided both additions to, and a commentary upon, the <span class="italic">Institutio</span>, summarizing procedural custom at Salisbury. The <span class="italic">Ordinale</span> and the <span class="italic">Consuetudinarium</span> together made up a guide to the use of Sarum, that form of services whose use became widespread in the English church during the thirteenth century, and which was to remain influential.<br>
<br>In 1215 Richard Poor was at last raised to the episcopate, being elected bishop of Chichester early in January and consecrated at Reading on the 25th. His time there was brief, however, as two years later, on 9 May 1217, he was granted custody of the bishopric of Salisbury at the instigation of Guala, the papal legate, although he was still described as bishop of Chichester on 28 May. He held the temporalities of the see of Salisbury by 27 June, when he received royal confirmation of his election. His work at Salisbury demonstrates his concern for church reform (one shared by many bishops of his day), and his wide-ranging abilities and interests. He was an active legislator, issuing a detailed set of statutes for Abingdon Abbey in 1219, concerning the status and rents of the servants of the obedientiaries there, as well as what were probably the earliest English diocesan statutes. These statutes, probably first issued between 1217 and 1219, and later amplified, display a remarkable clarity of thought and demonstrate the bishop's theological training, as well as his interest in the cure of souls, particularly the training and conduct of priests, and in the importance of penance. None of this is surprising in a man trained in Paris, who had attended the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, and who, before his rise to the episcopate, had urged Robert of Flamborough, a canon of St Victor at Paris, to write his penitential. Poor's statutes were to influence diocesan statutes as far afield as Canterbury and York. The bishop also ordered an inventory of all church property, an important step towards the division of episcopal and chapter property.<h2>
<a name="SalisburyCathedral"></a>Salisbury Cathedral</h2>Richard Poor was also the prime motivator behind the ambitious rebuilding of Salisbury Cathedral in the mid-thirteenth century. The old cathedral, at Old Sarum, was in a poor position, too near to the royal castle, and both small and cramped. Permission was sought, and received, from Pope Honorius III (<i>r</i>. 1216&#150;27) to move it two miles to the south in 1217, and the foundation stone was laid in 1220 by Richard Poor himself. The east end was dedicated in 1225, but the cathedral was not consecrated until 1258, more than twenty years after Poor's death, and the roof was not completed until 1266. This cathedral is remarkable, distinctive in style from other cathedrals of the same date, lacking the extravagant ornamentation of, for example, the work at Lincoln. Its unusual design reflects the influence of Bishop Poor, in that its simplicity has been linked to the reform movement of which he was so great an exponent, and to the French Gothic which his time abroad would have given him the opportunity to examine. Possibly, too, the bishop was affected by the well-known views of the Parisian master, Peter the Chanter, on extravagant buildings, views that one of Peter's eminent pupils, Stephen Langton, may well have expounded. The ordered layout of the floor plan can be linked to the processions of the use of Sarum, and the terminology of the use is also reflected in the iconography of the lady chapel. These matters must have been of great importance to the author of the <span class="italic">Ordinale</span> and the <span class="italic">Consuetudinarium</span>.<br>
<br>The cathedral's move seems to have encouraged interest in the cathedral's past, and at a time when the cults of so many local saints were being promoted it is unsurprising that attempts were made in the last years of Poor's episcopate to have Osmund, the first bishop of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1099), canonized. In 1226 the bishop had had the bodies of Osmund, Roger (<i>d</i>. 1139), and Jocelin (<i>d</i>. 1184)&#151;the first three bishops of Salisbury&#151;moved to the new cathedral. The chapter at Salisbury can hardly have been unaware of the translation of several saints in the decade before this. Richard Poor himself had been present at the translation of St Wulfstan at Worcester in 1218, and, more importantly, at the translation of St Thomas of Canterbury in 1220, when he had been the only member of the episcopate to aid his former tutor, Archbishop Langton, in the secret examination of the saint's body. Two other canons of Salisbury had been central in the organization of this ceremony; indeed, one of them, Master Elias of Dereham (<i>d</i>. 1245), may have designed Becket's shrine. In 1228 Pope Gregory IX (<i>r</i>. 1227&#150;41) was petitioned for Osmund's canonization, and Poor's letters show that he was anxious to urge the matter forwards, but this was to no avail. Osmund was not canonized until 1457, although his tomb did in the meantime become a centre for popular devotion.<h2>
<a name="BishopofDurham"></a>Bishop of Durham</h2>In the same year in which the bishop and chapter were petitioning the pope so urgently Poor was again translated, this time to the see of Durham. He was elected on 9 May 1228 and received papal confirmation of his translation five days later, on 14 May. He received the temporalities of the see on 22 July, and was enthroned on 4 September of the same year. At Durham he pursued the interests that he had demonstrated at Salisbury. His earlier statutes were reissued with suitable amendments, for example omitting the clause concerning bequests to the cathedral church at Salisbury, and he also maintained his interest in architecture, drawing up plans for the chapel of the nine altars at Durham, a project not undertaken until 1242, after his death, but one that shows clearly the influence of the work at Salisbury. It was his relationship with the cathedral chapter, however, that overshadowed his years at Durham. At his arrival he found a monastic chapter that had been involved in a bitter conflict with its previous prelate, Richard Marsh, concerning the powers of the bishop in respect to the cathedral priory. As recently as 1220&#150;23 the monks of Durham had appealed to the papal court, disputing the bishop's right to undertake a visitation of the priory.<br>
<br>Almost immediately upon his arrival Poor took an important step towards resolving this quarrel, drawing up the first written agreement on the matter, <span class="italic">Le convenit</span>, in 1228. In this extremely detailed document the monks were granted free election of their prior, subject to canonical legality and episcopal approval, a greater role in the administration of the affairs of the church, and more jurisdictional power in the liberty of Durham. The prior was given the right to stand next to the bishop, on his right, in the choir, and was also granted a court, free of certain episcopal customs. The monks gained the right of presentation to several churches and the custody of their churches <i>sede vacante</i>. The prior could appoint and dismiss all monastic officials, and the monks were to be free of procuration fees, and were granted certain rights in respect to the correction of faults discovered by the bishop during his visitation. Professions made to the prior were to be confirmed without delay by the bishop. The respective interests of the bishop and the prior in judicial pleas, the profits of justice, the spoils of wrecks, woodland, and navigation on the River Tees were defined, and the right of way over the bishop's land for water supplies was agreed. This settlement, detailed as it was, could not define all points of disagreement, and disputes over the rights of the bishop and chapter in Durham continued. Nevertheless, up to the dissolution this document remained the basis for the monastery's claims, and its existence was a remarkable achievement for a bishop with no direct experience of the particular problems of a monastic chapter. In addition Poor worked to settle other disagreements involving the chapter, for example ending a dispute between the cathedral priory and the archdeacon of Durham concerning their rights in several churches and chapels.<h2>
<a name="Judgedelegateandarbitrator"></a>Judge-delegate and arbitrator</h2>Richard Poor did not only settle disputes within his own diocese. Throughout his career he seems to have enjoyed a reputation for sound judgement, which led him to be appointed on many occasions as a papal judge-delegate. He had acted in this capacity before his appointment to the episcopate, for example with the prior of Dunstable in 1214 in a dispute concerning the right of election of the abbot of Bury St Edmunds. As bishop of Chichester he was called on to act as a judge for Salisbury Cathedral, and later as bishop of Salisbury he decided numerous cases both within the diocese, for example Breamore Abbey's claim to Coldstone Wake church, and outside it, as in the quarrel between the priory and the canons of Coventry concerning the right of election of their bishop. His work continued up to his death: in 1235, together with William of Raleigh (<i>d</i>. 1250), treasurer of Exeter and senior justice of the <i>coram rege</i> court, he settled a dispute between the bishop of Bath and Thomas Maudut and Nicholas Avenel, knights, over a portion of a prebend of Wells Cathedral. Richard Poor died on 15 April 1237 at the manor of Tarrant Keyneston in Dorset. Despite later claims in different sources that his tomb could be found at both Durham and Salisbury, it seems that he was buried in the churchyard of Tarrant Keyneston itself, as was his wish.<br>
