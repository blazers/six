<span class="headword">Whitty,  Michael James</span>  (1795&#150;1873), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and proprietor</span>, born in Enniscorthy, Wexford, was the son of a corn merchant and owner of some vessels trading from that port. Whitty was intended for the priesthood, but did not complete his studies. In 1821 he commenced his literary career in London, and among his earliest friends were Sir James Bacon and George Cruikshank. He was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">London and Dublin Magazine</span> in 1823, and in its first volume appeared the substance of a work which he later revised and published about 1870 as <span class="italic">Robert Emmet</span>, with a prefatory note signed M. J. W. He remained editor of the magazine until 1827. From 1823 to 1829 he contributed largely to Irish periodical literature, and was an ardent advocate for Catholic emancipation. He published anonymously in 1824 two volumes of <span class="italic">Tales of Irish Life</span>, with illustrations by Cruikshank. These stories depicted the customs and condition of the people of his homeland, and were a great success, being reprinted in America and also translated into French and German.<br>
<br>Whitty began his connection with Liverpool in January 1830, when he accepted the post of editor of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Journal</span>. He vacated this position in February 1836 on his appointment as chief constable of the borough. He had previously been superintendent of the nightly watch. During his twelve years' tenure of the office he perfected the organization of the police force and formed an efficient fire brigade. On his retirement he was presented by the town council with the sum of &pound;1000 in recognition of his services.<br>
<br>Whitty's connection with the <span class="italic">Liverpool Journal</span> had not been wholly severed during this period of his life, and in 1848 he bought the paper and resumed his literary work. For many years he acted as the Liverpool correspondent and agent of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. In 1851 he was a witness before the parliamentary commission appointed to inquire into the <span class="roman">Newspaper Stamp Act</span>, and he vigorously advocated the abolition of the stamp act, the advertisement duty, and the duty on paper. On the removal of these taxes he issued in 1855 the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, the first penny daily paper published in the United Kingdom. <span class="italic">Whitty's Guide to Liverpool</span> was also published from that office in 1868.<br>
<br>Whitty sold both his newspapers in 1869, and the last few years of his life were spent in retirement at Windermere Terrace, Prince's Park, Liverpool. He died there on 10 June 1873, and was buried at Anfield beside his wife, who was the sister of E. B. Neill, London correspondent of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Albion</span>. He was survived by his daughter, Anna Whitty, and his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29334/', "Edward Michael Whitty")</script>.<br>
