<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oman,  John Wood</span>  (1860&#150;1939), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on the farm of Biggins in the parish of Stenness, Orkney, on 23 July 1860, the second son of Simon Rust Oman, a farmer who in earlier years had been master of a sailing vessel, and his wife, Isabella Irvine Rendall. He owed his early education mainly to a tutor engaged for a neighbouring family and shared by a few other boys. Many references in Oman's works reveal how deeply his mind was shaped by the freedom and simplicity of his boyhood&#151;its close contacts with the soil and the sea, and with the hardy and vigorous folk who gained their living from them. He himself described his father, in the dedication of his Kerr lectures, as &#145;a scholar only of life and action, but my best teacher&#146;. He entered Edinburgh University in 1877, graduating in 1882 with first-class honours in philosophy and winning the Gray and Rhind scholarships. Thence he proceeded to the theological college of the United Presbyterian church in Edinburgh, and at the conclusion of the course there he studied at the universities of Erlangen, Heidelberg, and Neuch&acirc;tel. On his return to Scotland he served for a brief period as assistant minister at St James's Church, Paisley. In 1889 he accepted a call to be minister of Clayport Street Church, Alnwick, thus passing into the Presbyterian Church of England, in the service of which he remained to the end of his life. While at Alnwick he married in 1897 Mary Hannah, daughter of Henry Hunter Blair JP of Gosforth, a very happy union broken only by her death in 1936. They had four daughters.<br>
<br>It was during his ministry at Alnwick that Oman's quality as an unusually learned, powerful, and original thinker in the field of theology&#151;already known to his intimates&#151;began to be more widely known, mainly through the publication in 1902 of <span class="italic">Vision and Authority, or, The Throne of St Peter</span> (rev. edn, 1928), and in 1906 of his Kerr lectures, <span class="italic">The Problem of Faith and Freedom in the Last Two Centuries</span>. The former revealed a mind singularly able to keep profound and informed theological reflection in close relation with the religious life and its problems; the latter showed an easy, firsthand mastery, issuing in penetrating and original judgements, of the works of every relevant writer of importance from Pascal to Albrecht Ritschl. Before the publication of these two works he had produced in 1893 the first translation into English of F. E. D. Schleiermacher's epoch-making <span class="italic">Reden &uuml;ber die Religion</span>.<br>
<br>In 1907 Oman was appointed professor of systematic theology and apologetics in Westminster College, Cambridge, the theological college of the Presbyterian Church of England, where he remained until his retirement in 1935, having become principal in 1922. At Westminster College he was one of a remarkably distinguished teaching staff, his colleagues being John Skinner, Charles Anderson Scott, and Patrick Carnegie Simpson. During this time Oman came to be recognized, first in Cambridge and later more widely, as one of the most learned and original minds at work in theology. He was thrice (1913&#150;16, 1919&#150;22, 1929&#150;31) appointed Stanton lecturer in the philosophy of religion in the University of Cambridge, and served for many years on the board of the faculty of divinity and on its degree committee. In 1909 he became a member of Queens' College and in 1935 an honorary fellow of Jesus College; the honorary degree of DD was conferred upon him by the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford. In 1938 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. His own church honoured him by electing him moderator of the general assembly in 1931. He died at Cambridge on 7 May 1939.<br>
<br>Oman's eminent position as a thinker was achieved partly through his work as a teacher, which greatly influenced all his students, but more through his published writings, among which, besides those already named, should be mentioned <span class="italic">The Church and the Divine Order</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Grace and Personality</span> (1917), <span class="italic">The Paradox of the World</span> (1921), <span class="italic">The Natural and the Supernatural</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Concerning the Ministry</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Honest Religion</span> (published posthumously in 1941 with a memoir of the author by George Alexander and Herbert Henry Farmer). Of these <span class="italic">Grace and Personality</span> and <span class="italic">The Natural and the Supernatural</span> were the most important, both as affording insight into Oman's characteristic teaching and as permanent enrichments of theological literature. Oman's theology was built round a strongly personalistic doctrine of man and of God's dealings with man. Man's true end can only be achieved through a reverence which never subordinates sacred values to expediency or profit, a freedom which accepts all the risks of freedom, a sincerity which walks steadfastly by its own insight. All these needs and prerogatives of personality God himself unwaveringly respects, having himself created and bestowed them. In <span class="italic">Grace and Personality</span> this theme is worked out in relation to the central Christian doctrines of grace and forgiveness with a thoroughness, consistency, and power which made it, in the words of a critic, &#145;one of the major treasures of theological literature&#146;. In <span class="italic">The Natural and the Supernatural</span> the same basic thoughts were made the clue to the understanding of the nature and history of religion, and of the processes of knowledge, evolution, and the natural order, the whole constituting a sustained argument to justify the contention that there is direct awareness of the supernatural which leads on to fuller knowledge of God only as men live in loyalty to those sacred values through which he discloses himself to their souls.<br>
<br>Oman's writing is not always easy to follow, demanding close attention and a willingness to weigh every sentence with care; but it rises at times to real, if restrained, eloquence, is interspersed with apt illustration, and always rests on a vast knowledge which is masked from the uninformed by a refusal to adorn his pages with references to other authors. His character, in its massive and at times almost formidable integrity, was an impressive embodiment of his own teaching. Physically also he was impressive, being tall and with a noble head.<br>
