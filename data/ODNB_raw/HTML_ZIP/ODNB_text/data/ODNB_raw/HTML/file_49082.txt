<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coster family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1685&#150;1764), <span class="occ">copper smelters</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_49083"></a><span class="headword">John [ii] Coster</span>  (1647&#150;1718)<span class="occ"></span>. Born probably in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, he was the second of three sons of John [i] Coster (1615&#150;1678), iron-forge manager or smelter in the forest. John [ii]'s elder brother, Arthur (<i>d</i>. 1679), was involved in leasing property in Leigh Woods near Bristol in 1678 on behalf of Sir Clement Clerke (<i>d</i>. 1693) of Launde Abbey, Leicestershire, who was interested in experimental work in lead smelting. Under the management of Clerke's son Talbot, these experiments resulted in the successful introduction of coal to replace more expensive charcoal, thus lowering the production costs of lead. John [ii] was described in papers relating to a chancery action as &#145;chief agent&#146; of the process by 1685, when he was thirty-eight. The work was abandoned in that year because patent rights were claimed by George Villiers, fourth Viscount Grandison (<i>d</i>. 1699), the entrepreneur with whom the Clerkes worked originally at Leigh Woods and whose attempts elsewhere to use coal for lead smelting had proved less successful.<br>
<br>The Clerkes' Bristol experiments then turned to the coal-fired smelting of copper under the management of John [ii] Coster, who was later acknowledged to have been mainly responsible for the success of these new smelting techniques. An adapted reverberatory furnace was used, which reflected, or &#145;reverberated&#146;, heat from a vaulted roof, and separated the coal and its gases from the melting ores below. Later the process proved applicable also to tin, but it was particularly significant in revitalizing English copper smelting, which previously had proved uneconomic and had been entirely abandoned. Its revival during the early years of the eighteenth century provided a basis for a thriving British industry in the production of copper and its alloy, brass.<br>
<br>John [ii] Coster went on to manage a copper-smelting works for the London partnership headed by William Dockwra (<i>c</i>.1635&#150;1716), at Upper Redbrook on the River Wye. By the 1690s he was supplying, via the Thames, Dockwra's copper and brass works at Esher in Surrey. In the next decade he was developing his smelting methods, extending his activities to copper mining in Cornwall, where he bought ores extensively, and, still later, supplying the four major copper and brass companies, which, by then, had become established. In developing his own separate family business, he manufactured copper goods at watermills near Bristol, introducing water-powered rolling to the area. His headquarters were later established in the city.<br>
<br>John [ii] Coster was increasingly assisted by his three sons before his death at Upper Redbrook, Gloucestershire, on 13 October 1718. He left his wife, Mary (1664/5&#150;1734), twenty shares in the Redbrook company, a mansion at Whitecliff, Monmouthshire, and two houses on College Green, Bristol. Both John and Mary Coster were included on an engraved family memorial erected by their son Thomas in All Saints' Church, Newland, the parish church of Upper Redbrook, where they were buried.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49081"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Coster</span>  (1684&#150;1739)<span class="occ"></span>, their eldest son, was born on 20 December 1684. He was married twice, first, in 1720, to Jane Rous, and second, to Astrea (<i>d</i>. 1738), daughter of Sir John Smith of Long Ashton, Bristol. While residing at College Green, Bristol, in 1734, Thomas Coster was elected tory member of parliament for the city. A petition to parliament from the mayor and corporation after the election asserted that invalid votes had been responsible for his defeat of the former whig member but was withdrawn when difficulty arose substantiating the claim, which appears to have arisen solely from political bias. In the Commons Coster actively represented local commercial interests, including presenting a petition on behalf of the Society of Merchant Adventurers of Bristol on 3 March 1738. He retained his seat until his death, some five years later, when the great bell of every parish church in the city is said to have tolled throughout the day.<br>
<br>At Bristol Thomas Coster's responsibility for extending the manufacturing operations of the family business in the city included the establishment in 1728 of an additional new mill site. He became a partner in the Bristol Brass Company when it assimilated the Upper Redbrook Copper Company in 1722. Thomas, like his father before him, had previously worked in close association with the Bristol company and now, also like his father, he continued to confine his business activities to the production of copper. By 1730 the brass company had closed the Redbrook smelting site in favour of its Bristol works.<br>
<br>An abandoned works at Melincryddan, near Neath, south Wales, provided a replacement smelting site for the Costers' own separate family business during the planning of a large new site at White Rock, Swansea. The site had many advantages and, with its accessibility for seaborne transport of copper ores and the existence of massive stocks of coal, Swansea would later become the centre of copper smelting in Britain. However, at that time Bristol still remained the country's main focus of copper production, and satisfied local demands for copper to alloy with zinc in order to maintain production of its large output of brass. White Rock was not completed until after Thomas's death, which occurred in Bristol on 30 September 1739, by which time he was the sole survivor of the Coster brothers.<br>
<br>Thomas Coster left &pound;40,000 and his property to his only child, Jane (1720&#150;1808), who in 1741 married John Hoblyn (<i>d</i>. 1751), after he had become an active partner in the family business. Although the male line of the Coster copper smelters ceased with Thomas, Jane, through her husband, extended the business involvement of the family. She erected a plaque to her father's memory in Bristol Cathedral.<br>
<br>Thomas Coster's two younger brothers were active mainly in Cornwall. <a name="cosubject_49082"></a><span class="headword">John [iii] Coster</span>  (1688&#150;1731)<span class="occ"></span> probably remained unmarried; and <a name="cosubject_47072"></a><span class="headword">Robert Coster</span>  (1696&#150;1736)<span class="occ"></span> married Grace, sister of Sir William Pendarves (1696&#150;1765) of Cornwall. The brothers were concerned with mining management, new mining equipment, and the organization of buying and selling ore, with John [iii] taking much the senior role. In collaboration with his father, John [iii] registered a new type of engine for drawing water out of deep mines, under patent no. 397 in 1714. He and Thomas received an equal number of shares, together with much property in the family business, at the death of their father in 1718. John [iii] Coster died on 27 June 1731.<br>
<br>Robert Coster was still a minor when his father's will was made, and although he received a smaller share of his estate, he grew in influence with time. His wife, Grace Pendarves, inherited Cornish land and mining property from her brother, Sir William Pendarves, after his widow's death. Following Robert Coster's death, aged forty, on 31 March 1736, Grace married Samuel Percival (<i>d</i>. 1764), who then became a partner of the Coster business. Although the women of the family played no active role in the business, they in fact sustained it by bringing in new partners through their marriages. After Thomas Coster's death, the partnership was further expanded and eventually renamed the Samuel Percival and Copper Company. Following Percival's death in 1764, the then senior partner gave his name to the business as the John Freeman and Copper Company, which survived at Swansea in reduced form until about 1870.<br>
<br>Throughout these changes in name the business remained a direct descendant of that built up by the Costers, initiated by John [ii] Coster and made possible by his significant innovations in coal-fired smelting and his development of the reverberatory furnace. Apart from its other important eighteenth-century uses in tin and lead production, this furnace was ultimately adapted late in the eighteenth century by Henry Cort for his process of making &#145;puddled&#146; iron, thus bringing British production of wrought iron to the fore in the early nineteenth century. By then the economic and technical development of copper smelting in the reverberatory furnaces of south Wales was leading the world in copper production.<br>
