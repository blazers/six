<span class="headword">Knightley,  Richard</span>  (1593&#150;1639), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 June 1593, the eldest surviving son of Edward Knightley, esquire (<i>d</i>. 1598), of Preston Capes, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Mary Coles (1577&#150;1611), daughter of Peter Coles, gentleman, of Preston Capes. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 21 October 1612 and on 4 July 1614 married Bridget (<i>c</i>.1593&#150;1639&times;55), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17151/', "Sir Thomas Lucy")</script> of Charlecote, Warwickshire. The marriage was childless and in the inquest following Knightley's death it was declared that his widow was a lunatic. Knightley sat as knight of the shire for Northamptonshire in the parliaments of 1621, 1624, 1625, and 1628&#150;9.<br>
<br>During the 1620s and 1630s Knightley was an influential figure in Northamptonshire, where he inherited the religious and political connections of his renowned grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15744/', "Sir Richard Knightley")</script> of Fawsley. The family had been established in the county since the early fifteenth century when they acquired a large estate centred on the manor of Fawsley. Richard Knightley succeeded to this in 1618 when his uncle, Sir Valentine, died without leaving a male heir; and Fawsley Hall became his principal residence. His return to parliament at a by-election in November 1621 was a reflection of the family's status among the gentry in the western half of the shire, where they were second only to the Spencers of Althorp. Knightley became a justice of the peace about the same time and was made a deputy lieutenant in the mid-1620s.<br>
<br>Knightley was an active figure in local government, notable particularly for the vigour with which he pursued Roman Catholics. This led to a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> in October 1625 when he was assaulted while leading a search for arms at the house of the Catholic Lord Vaux. Vaux seems to have been provoked by Knightley's insistence that, in accordance with the recent statute, his brother be fined for swearing; but Vaux was summoned before the council and imprisoned. Knightley's anti-popery and determination to punish swearing were symptoms of a Calvinist zeal which lay at the heart of his beliefs and many of his actions. His will referred to his conviction that he would &#145;be receaved into everlasting happiness as one of the elect of God&#146;  (will) and he was described by a contemporary as &#145;a great countenancer and protector of the puritans&#146;  (Cliffe, 182). He continued the family tradition of promoting a godly preaching ministry. His restoration of the impropriated livings of Fawsley and Preston Capes to the church earned praise in a 1641 survey of the state of the clergy; he was said to be the &#145;bosom friend&#146; of John Preston, the distinguished court preacher and chaplain to Prince Charles, who retired to Fawsley to die in July 1628  (Morgan, 70); and he supported and protected individual ministers. The main beneficiary of this patronage was John Dod, the eminent puritan divine who had been hounded out of various livings for his failure to conform. Soon after 1625 Knightley procured a licence for him to preach at Fawsley, and he remained there until his death in 1645, shielded from the church authorities in the 1620s and 1630s by Knightley's influence and sustained by a series of trust funds. Knightley's lay friends were also drawn mainly from the ranks of fellow puritans. Among local gentry those he collaborated most closely with were puritans such as Sir Thomas Crewe and his son, John, Christopher Sherland, the recorder of Northampton, and, especially, his near neighbours Erasmus Dryden and his son, Sir John, who also protected Dod. The feoffees Knightley chose to administer Dod's trust were virtually a roll-call of godly allies outside the shire, including Lord Saye and Sele, John Hampden, John Pym, Sir Arthur Hesilrige, and Sir Nathaniel Rich.<br>
<br>Knightley's standing in puritan circles, and his own commitment to the godly cause, ensured that from the mid-1620s he was drawn increasingly into national politics. During the 1624 parliament, when the duke of Buckingham was recruiting puritan allies to support his policy of war against Spain, he became a client of the royal favourite. By late April he was writing to him in familiar terms, lamenting the duke's absence from court and impressing on him the need for urgency in dealing with Spain and the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Cranfield. The relationship continued through 1625 until November, when it was disrupted by Knightley's being pricked as a sheriff to prevent him from sitting in parliament the following year. This was Charles's doing&#151;apparently because he disapproved of Knightley's role in the Vaux case&#151;but he assumed it was the work of Buckingham and loudly protested his &#145;continual and sole dependence&#146; on him and &#145;the endeavours he had used in parliament&#146; for his and the king's service  (Anstruther, 448). Early in 1626 he appears to have become even more disillusioned with the royal favourite. Preston wrote to him soon after the York House conference in February warning that the duke had disappointed their earlier hopes that he would become a supporter of the godly cause. From this point onwards Knightley was a forceful opponent of court policy.<br>
<br>This became apparent in January 1627 when Knightley led resistance to the forced loan in Northamptonshire. At a meeting with a delegation of privy councillors in Northampton he presented a protest by local gentry and freeholders declaring that they were willing to pay the levy only if it was approved by parliament. He was summoned to London where he refused to kneel before the council table&#151;&#145;lest &hellip; he should seem to acknowledge a fault&#146;&#151;and was promptly imprisoned in the Fleet  (Cust, 166). However, he remained defiant, continuing to co-ordinate opposition and agitate for the loan refusers to be heard in court which eventually resulted in the <i>Five Knights' case</i>. He was released from confinement the following January and was again elected knight of the shire for the 1628 parliament.<br>
<br>In spite of his reputation in Northamptonshire as &#145;a parliament man of much esteem&#146;  (Ball, 152), Knightley was never in the front rank of Commons orators; however, he was a diligent attender of committees and would speak out on the issues which concerned him. Foremost among these was religion. He was quick to support any measures to curb Catholics, urging that they be disarmed in February 1624 and warning of the dangers of not enforcing the recusancy statutes in June 1625. He was also very conscious of threats to Calvinist orthodoxy, protesting at the poisonous influence of Arminian sermons in June 1628. His most significant interventions on secular issues were in 1628. He was especially concerned about the dangers of billeting, repeatedly warning that the presence of Catholic Irish soldiers in Northamptonshire was a standing invitation to a papist uprising. He also delivered a fierce attack on Buckingham, whom he described as &#145;an enemy of all christendom&#146;, because of his willingness to grant letters of marque to Catholics and thereby undermine the loyalty of the navy  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 4.120). This last speech&#151;following closely on an attack on Buckingham's religion by his friend Sherland&#151;marked the final stage of Knightley's turning against his former patron.<br>
<br>After the dissolution of parliament in 1629 Knightley's opportunities to intervene in national politics became limited, but he remained a central figure among opponents of Charles's regime. He was &#145;the most faithful friend and brother&#146; to Sir John Eliot while the latter was incarcerated in the Tower in the early 1630s, supplying him with a stream of advice and support  (Forster, 492). In addition he was a leading shareholder in the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95346', "Providence Island Company")</script>, originally established to colonize the West Indies but at the same time providing a forum for covert meetings between leading opponents of royal policy. These were also taking place at Fawsley and at Lord Brooke's residence of Warwick Castle and out of them emerged, among other things, a co-ordinated resistance to the crown's prerogative taxation in which Knightley continued to play his part. According to the earl of Exeter, &#145;Precise Ric Knightley&#146; was among those who refused to pay knighthood fines in 1630, giving as his reason the fact that he had been sheriff at the time of the king's coronation and could not leave the shire  (U. Nott. L., Clifton MSS, 631). He was less openly opposed to ship money than Saye and Hampden, but he was still reported to the council for stirring up disputes over ratings in Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>The impression which emerges from a study of Knightley's career is of a forceful and principled politician who commanded enormous respect among his contemporaries. His commitment to defending the Calvinist religion and the liberties of the subject was unswerving and, had he survived, he would surely have been an influential member of the parliamentarian leadership during the civil war. He died on 8 November 1639 and was buried at Fawsley on the 11th. His cousin Richard Knightley (1580&#150;1650), son of Thomas Knightley of Burgh Hall, Staffordshire, succeeded him, and was in turn succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15746/', "Sir Richard Knightley (1609/10&#150;1661)")</script>.<br>
