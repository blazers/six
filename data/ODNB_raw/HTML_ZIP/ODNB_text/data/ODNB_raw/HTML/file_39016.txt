<span class="headword">Jeyes,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1817, <em>d.</em> 1892), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was baptized on 10 June 1817 at Wootton, near Northampton, the second son and third child of Philadelphus Jeyes (1780&#150;1828), a retail pharmacist, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ward, daughter of a local landowner. On his father's death, the family business in Northampton was taken over by John's elder brother, also Philadelphus, who had been educated at a school in Moulton, his mother's village, before being apprenticed to a local pharmacist. It seems likely that John's own upbringing followed a similar course, although it is not known to whom he was apprenticed or to what extent he received formal training in chemistry. Unlike Philadelphus, however, he did not become a member of the Pharmaceutical Society.<br>
<br>Evidence suggests that Jeyes abandoned a course in pharmacy to pursue an interest in botany, which brought him a partnership with James Atkins, a local nurseryman. Philadelphus also became financially involved, so that by 1845 the joint business as seedsmen and florists, originally styled Atkins and Jeyes, had become Jeyes &amp; Co. Little is known about Jeyes's years as a nurseryman, but it was during this period, on 10 March 1846, that he married Sarah Frances Weldon (<i>d</i>. 1888), the daughter of a &#145;subdistributor of stamps&#146;. The marriage took place at St Mary's Church in her home town of Stamford, Lincolnshire. They had nine children: Oliver Weldon, Jeanne Frances, Edith, Mary Alice, Samuel Henry, Walter, Gertrude, Charles, and Robert, the last dying in infancy.<br>
<br>The family initially lived at Holly Lodge, Northampton, a house built by the younger Philadelphus. Following the birth of Walter in 1859, Jeyes and his family moved to London. The reason for the move is uncertain. It may simply have been to broaden his business interests, since after the birth of Charles in 1863, when the family was living in Finsbury, Jeyes's occupation is entered in local trade directories as &#145;hearth rug manufacturer, boot and shoe factor, importer and purifier of bed feathers, horse hair, wool, etc.&#146; In 1871, in Plaistow, Essex, Jeyes, now styling himself as a manufacturing chemist, set up his first major business venture, the Jeyesine Oil and Paint Company Ltd. The enterprise was a failure and closed in 1873.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Jeyes had become increasingly interested in the &#145;sanitary debate&#146; then current among the medical and allied professions. Sanitary conditions in towns and cities at that time were often rudimentary, especially in the poorer quarters, and there was a constant threat of disease. There was an active medical and commercial concern to develop a product that would effectively combat the widespread filth and pollution. Until then it had traditionally been the practice to treat any disagreeable stench or insanitary conditions by using deodorizers or antiseptics. Jeyes saw that this was not enough. The deodorizer might replace an unpleasant smell by a sweeter one, and the antiseptic prevent decomposition or the breeding of germs, but what was also needed was a disinfectant, to kill bacteria; this could be achieved by means of a carbolic-based solution. On 7 December 1877 Jeyes patented Jeyes' Fluid, a preparation that was chemically a saponified solution of phenols, with added resins and other compounds. Although Jeyes' Fluid was not the only disinfectant, and had rivals in such products as Izal and Condy's Fluid, it had the edge over them in many respects. It was less caustic and generally safer than neat carbolic acid, had a pleasanter yet distinctive smell, and was marketed at a price that suited the public. Jeyes's popular advertising stressed the fact that his fluid was not simply a deodorizer but also an effective disinfectant and antiseptic.<br>
<br>In 1879 Jeyes and his son Walter established Jeyes' Sanitary Compounds Company Ltd, and built a factory to manufacture the fluid in the grounds of Richmond House, Plaistow, his home since 1874. Although initial sales were good, Jeyes was a poor businessman, and rising debts resulting from fraud and mismanagement obliged the firm to go into voluntary liquidation in 1884. Its assets were sold in 1885 to a successor company, of the same name but with a new board of directors. Although Jeyes remained an employee of the reconstituted company that bore his name, he was poorly treated by its directors, to whom he had signed away all his rights. A financial statement of 1888, the year of his wife's death, describes him simply as &#145;works manager&#146; and gives his annual salary as &pound;260, as compared to the &pound;300 received by the company secretary.<br>
<br>On 12 January 1892, at his home, 5 Windsor Road, Forest Gate, West Ham, Essex, John Jeyes died of &#145;senile decay&#146; at the age of seventy-five. He was buried in the same grave as his wife in the East London cemetery, Plaistow. He left only &pound;585, as against the &pound;24,000 in the will of his brother, Philadelphus, who died in 1893, and the &pound;12,000 left by his son, Oliver, who died in the same year and whose business (paint manufacturing in Birmingham) was nothing like the size of his father's.<br>
<br>John Jeyes was a large, amiable, and kindly man, who became a household name more through his inventive mind and sound chemical knowledge than from any business acumen or entrepreneurial shrewdness.<br>
