<span class="headword">Barber,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1675, <em>d.</em> 1741), <span class="occ">printer and local politician</span>, was born at Gray's Inn Lane, London, in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn. He was baptized at St Andrew's on 11 April 1675. His father, Morgan Barber, had been a journeyman barber&#150;surgeon to Benjamin Tomlinson, whose widow, Mary, he subsequently married; John was the only surviving child of the marriage. With the help of his godfather Elkanah Settle, the &#145;City Poet&#146;, John was sent to a school in Hampstead. On 6 May 1689 Settle apprenticed him to George Larkin, a printer in Bishopsgate. Barber served most of his time, however, with Mrs Hannah Clarke, a widow who continued her husband's printing business at Thames Street. Barber was freed of the Stationers' Company on 6 June 1696.<br>
<br>Barber became a manager for Mrs Clarke before setting up his own business in 1700. His business prospered, and in 1705 he became a liveryman of the Stationers' Company, but his rise to prominence in printing circles was attributable to his contacts with the tory party. The printer of <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, he became a friend of Jonathan Swift and Henry St John, later first Viscount Bolingbroke, and the lover of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17939/', "Mrs Delarivier Manley")</script>, with whom he lived from 1714 onwards. When the tories achieved power in 1710 Barber landed some lucrative contracts. In 1711 he became the official printer of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> and the South Sea Company. Two years later he obtained a reversion to the office of the queen's printer.<br>
<br>Although Barber found himself in the political wilderness with the tories' fall from power after the death of Queen Anne in 1714, he remained loyal to his friends and true to his tory principles. In 1715 he was called &#145;Tyrant&#146; by the duke of Ormond in a letter to Swift, a nickname that proved enduring  (Rivington, 71). In 1720 he speculated successfully in South Sea stock, making an apparent profit of &pound;30,000, and this enabled him to purchase a coat of arms, an estate in East Sheen, and a town house at Queen Square, London, and to consider retiring from business. In the same year a former servant of Mrs Manley's, Sarah Dovekin or Duffkin (<i>bap</i>. 1699, <i>d</i>. 1758) replaced Manley in Barber's affections.<br>
<br>Barber's independent fortune also enabled him to focus his energies on civic politics. Already a common councilman for Queenhithe (since 1711) and a well-known opponent of the great whig financiers who dominated the City's upper court, he became alderman for the tory ward of Castle Baynard in 1722 and a leading City critic of Sir Robert Walpole. In 1722 he was implicated in the Atterbury plot (an attempt to restore James Stuart to the throne) following Barber's departure in April for Rome bearing &pound;50,000 in bills of exchange. Never formally accused or punished for this, he was nevertheless unable to return to England until August 1724. Once back in London, he opposed the <span class="roman">City Elections Act</span> of 1725 and as sheriff (1729&#150;30) facilitated the acquittal of Richard Franklin, the printer of <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, who had been prosecuted by the government for seditious libel. As lord mayor (1732&#150;3) he co-ordinated the City's opposition to Walpole's <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> in 1733, and vigorously defended the raucous jubilation that accompanied its withdrawal from the Commons.<br>
<br>Barber's defence of the City's political liberties and trading interests made him very popular in London circles. Even so, he was narrowly defeated in the City parliamentary election of 1734 and failed to make the opposition slate in 1740&#150;41. On both occasions his tory-Jacobite past counted against him.<br>
<br>Barber's interest in City politics waned a little after 1738, but he was active in the controversial mayoral elections of 1740 when the whig-dominated court of aldermen sought to exclude Sir Robert Godschall from the chair. Barber died on 2 January 1741 at his home in Queen Square, London. The bulk of his estate went to his common-law wife, Dovekin. He had no children.<br>
