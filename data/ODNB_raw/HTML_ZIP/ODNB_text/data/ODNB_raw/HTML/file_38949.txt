<span class="headword">Traquair <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Moss]</span>,  Phoebe Anna</span>  (1852&#150;1936), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 24 May 1852 in Kilternan, co. Dublin, the sixth of the seven children of William Moss, surgeon, of Dublin and his wife, Teresa, daughter of John and Jane Richardson of Kilgobbin, co. Dublin. From 1869 to 1872 she studied at the School of Design of the Royal Dublin Society. On 5 June 1873 she married in Dublin the Scottish palaeontologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48896/', "Ramsay Heatley Traquair (1840&#150;1912)")</script>, whose research papers she had illustrated. On his appointment to the Museum of Science and Art, they moved in early 1874 to Edinburgh, where their three children, Ramsay (<i>b</i>. 1874), Harry (<i>b</i>. 1875), and Hilda (<i>b</i>. 1879), were born.<br>
<br>Traquair's earliest surviving works, produced in the late 1870s, are landscape watercolours and embroidered domestic textiles; examples of both are in private collections and in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. By the mid-1880s her expanding social circle included the biologist and sociologist Patrick Geddes, whose Edinburgh Social Union in 1885 engaged her to decorate the tiny new mortuary chapel of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Completed in 1886, the chapel was demolished in 1894 but wall sections survive in a new building. She restored these transferred walls within a new scheme of 1896&#150;8 painted in the simpler style of a child's picture book.<br>
<br>In the later 1880s Traquair worked figural embroidered panels for draughtscreens. The finest is her triptych <span class="italic">The Salvation of Mankind</span> (1887&#150;93; City Art Centre, Edinburgh). Her style was initially close to the symbolist work of Edward Burne-Jones and D. G. Rossetti, which had been promoted in reviews by Geddes and was also supported by another friend, John Miller Gray, first curator of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Gray and Ruskin, with whom she corresponded in 1887, encouraged Traquair to illuminate manuscripts. She also began to work on commercial book design and illustration for Walter Scott of London and T. and A. Constable of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Traquair's decoration of the song school of St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral, Edinburgh (1888&#150;92), won her national recognition. Illustrating the <span class="roman">Benedicite</span> and combining portraiture with a skilful use of colour and decorative pattern, the scheme showed both technical innovation and stylistic independence. Together with the range of her crafts (which now included book cover tooling), her third Edinburgh decoration, at the Catholic Apostolic church (1893&#150;1901), demonstrated a reintegration of art with craft. This major mural scheme turned a neo-Norman church into a &#145;jewelled crown&#146; and, like her outstanding quartet of silk-embroidered panels <span class="italic">The Progress of a Soul</span> (1893&#150;1902; National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), it illustrated the journey of the human spirit through life. Her illuminated manuscripts of the 1890s, many of which illustrated Rossetti, Tennyson, the Brownings, and Dante (and some of which are in the National Library of Scotland and priv. coll.), share with them an intensity of colour and tactile values. She was now Scotland's leading arts and crafts artist.<br>
<br>After 1900 Traquair's diverse studio crafts included the fashionable art of enamelling alongside book cover tooling and art embroidery. She produced hundreds of pieces of jewellery and ornamental work. As she had exhibited by invitation at the world fair in Chicago in 1893, so in 1904 she showed <span class="italic">The Progress of a Soul</span> in St Louis. Her mural work, now on a reduced level, included the chancel of the church of St Peter at Clayworth, Nottinghamshire (1904&#150;5), and the Manners chapel at Thorney Hill in the New Forest, Hampshire (1920&#150;22).<br>
<br>In 1906, on her husband's retirement, the Traquairs moved to the village of Colinton, then developing as an &#145;arts and crafts&#146; suburb of Edinburgh. In 1920 she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy. Phoebe Traquair died in Edinburgh on 4 August 1936 and was buried at Colinton parish church.<br>
