<span class="headword">Cumming,  Hanway Robert</span>  (1867&#150;1921), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, was born at 37 Thurloe Square, Brompton, west London, on 29 October 1867, the fourth son of Hugh Macpherson Cumming, civil servant, and his wife, Emma Spencer Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke. Educated at King's College School, London, he entered the army via the militia, joining the 3rd battalion, the Buffs (East Kent regiment) as second lieutenant in May 1887, before gaining a regular commission in the Durham light infantry on 8 June 1889. He served with the 2nd battalion in India and, following promotion to captain in November 1897, proceeded to south Africa with the 1st battalion. During the South African War he participated in the relief of Ladysmith and saw action at Colenso, Vaal Kranz, Tugela Heights, and Laing's Nek, rising to brevet major in November 1900, receiving the Queen's Medal with four clasps, and being twice mentioned in dispatches. His career path now veered towards staff, rather than regimental, duties.<br>
<br>Having attended the Staff College in 1901&#150;2, Cumming held a succession of staff appointments, first in Ceylon as deputy assistant quartermaster-general (July 1903 &#150; April 1905) and deputy assistant adjutant-general (May 1905 &#150; January 1906) and then as staff officer for coast defence in the Welsh and midland command and western command until 30 July 1907. In a civil ceremony on 9 July 1903 he married Beatrice, the 28-year-old daughter of the late Colonel William Archibald Taylor, a former officer of the Gordon highlanders and yeomanry. The marriage was also solemnized at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 7 June 1905. From January 1909 to January 1913 he commanded a company of cadets at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, but the outbreak of the First World War found him serving with the 1st Durham light infantry on the north-west frontier of India and he briefly held a post on the staff of the 1st (Peshawar) division before returning home to become, on 11 June 1915, general staff officer (GSO) second grade, of the 31st division, a new army formation primarily composed of locally-raised &#145;pals&#146; battalions from northern England.<br>
<br>From this point Cumming's solid but hitherto somewhat uneventful career underwent a notable transformation. He was elevated to GSO first grade, with the rank of temporary lieutenant-colonel, on 24 August 1915, accompanying the division to Egypt in November. Soon after the division was transferred to France in March 1916, he moved on 2 April, still as GSO first grade, to the 48th (south midland) division, a territorial formation. He was centrally involved in the planning of that division's difficult operations around Ovillers and Pozi&egrave;res in July and August 1916, during the battle of the Somme. On 26 August he was given command of his old regular battalion, the 2nd Durham light infantry, leading it in the fighting south-east of Ginchy and near Morval and Lesboeufs in September. He remained with the battalion for two more months but was evidently considered as fitted for further promotion and, on 26 November, was appointed commander of the 91st infantry brigade in the 7th division with the rank of temporary brigadier-general. His brigade major until March 1917 was Major Richard O'Connor, who had been in Cumming's cadet company at Sandhurst and who himself went on to high command in the Second World War. O'Connor learned much from Cumming's attention to detail and insistence on rigorous training and admired Cumming's willingness to put the preservation of the lives of his men before his personal ambitions.<br>
<br>Endowed with both physical and moral courage, Cumming tended to question orders that he deemed unwise. Indeed, on 23 February 1917 he even stood up successfully to the impulsive commander of the Fifth Army, General Sir Hubert Gough, over the timing of an advance by Cumming's brigade in pursuit of German units that were beginning to withdraw to the Hindenburg line. Cumming was twice overruled in March by his divisional commander, Major-General George Barrow, after pointing out obvious flaws in plans for attacks at Bucquoy and Croisilles during later stages of the same pursuit. However, at Bullecourt in May, he pushed his luck once too often, his new divisional commander, Major-General Thomas Shoubridge, proving a tougher adversary than Barrow. When his brigade's assault on 12 May was checked in, and east of, Bullecourt village, Cumming argued against further attacks that day, advocating instead a surprise attack next morning without prolonged artillery preparation. An annoyed Shoubridge promptly accused Cumming of being &#145;too tired to cope with the situation&#146;, suggested that his judgement was therefore &#145;warped&#146;, and compelled him to relinquish his command  (Cumming, 84).<br>
<br>Despite this setback, Cumming was awarded the DSO in June 1917 and, as commander of the machine-gun corps training centre at Grantham from 3 August 1917 to 1 February 1918, he played a pivotal role in the reorganization that removed machine-gun companies from brigade control and formed them into battalions under divisional command. This timely reform, enacted in February&#150;March 1918, gave the divisions of the British expeditionary force the potential to achieve greater concentrations, and tighter tactical control, of automatic firepower in the battles to come. Cumming's reward was a posting back to the western front on 16 March 1918 as commander of the 110th brigade in the 21st division under Major-General David Campbell, a more sympathetic officer who recognized Cumming's abilities and found his advice of &#145;inestimable value&#146;  (Cumming, 13). Cumming reached his new brigade, containing three Leicestershire battalions, on 18 March, three days before the Germans launched their massive offensive in Picardy.<br>
<br>When the storm broke over the British Fifth Army on 21 March 1918 Cumming's brigade, defending the double village of Ep&eacute;hy-Peizi&egrave;re, held its main battle zone throughout the first day, disrupting the German timetable and only falling back next morning under heavy pressure. In the fluid battle that followed, Cumming, like many other brigade commanders, conducted a skilful fighting withdrawal, often out of contact with higher headquarters but keeping in touch with his own scattered units as best he could and assembling scratch forces from his shattered battalions whenever circumstances permitted. On 23 March he narrowly escaped death. Having visited a neighbouring formation he strayed into a German-occupied village and came under close-range fire. His wounded horse died after carrying him to safety. Three days later, by which time the division had retired some 15 miles to positions between the Somme and Ancre, he had to organize a composite brigade from an entrenching battalion, stragglers, reinforcement drafts, and men returning from leave. On relief at the end of March, the division had barely 200 fit fighting soldiers in each battalion, but Cumming observed that their morale was unshaken, that the withdrawal had been carried out with &#145;steadiness and discipline&#146;, and that &#145;the front had remained unbroken&#146;  (Cumming, 129).<br>
<br>Transferred to the Second Army, the 21st division went into the line near Voormezeele, south-east of Ypres, on 4&#150;5 April. Within five days it faced a second German onslaught, the Lys offensive, but with less room to manoeuvre or withdraw than in March. As the battle spread north towards Ypres, the 21st division was soon engaged in another desperate struggle. This came to a head on 28&#150;9 April when the Germans took Voormezeele and pushed on to Lock 8, Bedford House, Rifle Wood, and the Kruistraathoek crossroads. The 110th brigade was drawn into hand-to-hand combat before the Germans were halted. The 21st division was relieved by 1 May but, after this second testing spell of defensive action, Cumming was &#145;weary to the verge of breaking point&#146;  (Cumming, 150).<br>
<br>The exhausted division was sent to a supposedly quieter sector on the Aisne yet, on 27 May, there found itself in the path of a third enemy offensive. The Germans advanced so rapidly that again it fell to Cumming and his fellow brigadiers to make crucial tactical decisions and order movements on their own initiative. This time, however, the ordeal was not lengthy, as the division was relieved shortly after the remnants of Cumming's brigade had pulled back across the Marne on 30 May.<br>
<br>Cumming clearly profited from the experience of the spring battles. In the final, victorious British offensive of August to November 1918, when the conduct of operations once more largely devolved upon divisional and brigade commanders, he handled the 110th brigade with a mixture of determination, flexibility, and common sense. Fresh tactical challenges were encountered almost daily and brigade headquarters sometimes had to move two or three times in twenty-four hours, but Cumming maintained sufficient grip on his subordinate units to enable the 110th brigade to play its full part in the 21st division's successful advance from the Ancre to the Sambre and beyond. In David Campbell's words, Cumming &#145;proved himself to be not only a magnificent leader of men, but also a soldier of the very highest class&#146;  (Cumming, 13). With George Gater and A. J. McCulloch he was one of a remarkable triumvirate of brigade commanders in the 21st division in August 1918.<br>
<br>Although awarded the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, fourth class, and twice more mentioned in dispatches, Cumming surprisingly received no additional major honour after the war and was even on half-pay from April 1919 to June 1920. However, on 7 June 1920, he was made a substantive colonel and given command of the Durham territorial brigade with the rank, once again, of temporary brigadier-general. He held the post until 24 November, subsequently becoming colonel commandant of the Kerry infantry brigade and military governor of Kerry in Ireland. He was shot in the head and killed in a Sinn F&eacute;in ambush at Clonbanin, co. Cork, on 5 March 1921, while driving in convoy to his headquarters at Buttevant from Mallow, where he had presided over a court of inquiry into previous shootings. There is strong evidence to suggest, however, that the intended target of the ambush was actually Major-General Sir Peter Strickland, the commander of the British 6th division in Ireland, who was on a tour of inspection in co. Kerry at the time. His funeral, with full military honours, took place at Golders Green crematorium, London, on 10 March 1921. His widow's claims for compensation involved her in legal disputes, financial distress, appearances before the criminal courts in connection with alleged fraudulent dealings in works of art, and eventual penury.<br>
<br>Cumming's book <span class="italic">A Brigadier in France, 1917&#150;1918</span> was published posthumously in 1922. While curiously written in the third person, it is an outspoken, illuminating, and vivid account of the demanding life of an infantry brigade commander on the western front in the First World War.<br>
