<span class="headword">Allen,  Robert Calder</span>  (1812&#150;1903), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 8 August 1812, was the son of William Allen, a master in the navy and presumably a follower of Admiral Sir Robert Calder. He entered the navy as a second-class volunteer in July 1827. In that grade and as second master he served with credit, principally on the west coast of Africa and in China. On 26 August 1841 he was advanced to be master, and in 1842&#150;5 was master of the <i>Dido</i> under Captain Henry Keppel, during her celebrated cruises against the Malay pirates of Borneo. Here Allen demonstrated both courage and high seamanship. In 1850&#150;51 he was master of the <i>Resolute</i> in the Arctic, under Captain Horatio Austin, whom he followed from the <i>Blenheim</i>, and had charge of the magnetic observations. In 1854&#150;5 he was master of the blockship <i>Hogue</i> in the Baltic, and rendered efficient service by his survey, often under fire, of the approaches to Bomarsund. In June 1863 he was promoted to the then new rank of staff commander, and in July 1867 to that of staff captain. In 1866&#150;7 he was master attendant and harbour-master at Malta and in 1867 he was appointed in the same capacity to Devonport, before being transferred to Deptford. When that dockyard was closed in October 1870 he retired with the rank of captain. He was a silent, thoughtful man, modest and retiring. The subordinate position in which so much of his service was passed prevented his name from coming prominently before the public but in the navy his reputation as a sound and skilful navigator and pilot stood very high, and was officially recognized by a CB in 1877.<br>
<br>Allen was twice married. With his first wife he had a daughter and four sons, who all entered the public service, navy, army or marines. His second wife survived him. He died at his home, 72 Shirland Road, Paddington, London on 29 January 1903.<br>
