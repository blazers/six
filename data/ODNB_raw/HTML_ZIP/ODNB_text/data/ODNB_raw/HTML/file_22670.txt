<span class="headword">Power,  Richard</span>, first earl of Tyrone  (1629/30&#150;1690), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of John Power, fifth Baron le Power and Coroghmore (<i>d</i>. 1665), of Curraghmore, co. Waterford, and his wife, Ruth (<i>d</i>. 1641), daughter of John Pypho of St Mary's Abbey, Dublin, and his wife, Kinbrough Valentine; he was said to be twelve in a document dated 17 June 1642. About the time of his birth his father became a lunatic and in December 1641, shortly after the outbreak of the Irish rising, his pregnant mother died of shock when a party of rebels burst into Curraghmore. The dominant influence on Richard's upbringing was therefore his grandmother Kinbrough Pypho. During the turbulent years of the rising and Commonwealth, it was the lunacy of Lord Power that saved the Curraghmore estate from confiscation: he was placed under the protection of the lords justices in 1642, and was exempted from transplantation by order of the lord protector in 1654.<br>
<br>The allegiance of the Powers, as Catholic landowners, would naturally have been to the Irish Catholic confederation. Richard, however, was too young to take part in the rising and after the victory of the parliamentary army he &#145;demeaned himself inoffensively to the English, [and hath] slain (with the assistance of his father's tenants) divers tories [rebels] and brought others prisoners to the English garrisons where they have been executed&#146;  (<span class="italic">In the House of Lords</span>, no. 16). He appears to have taken his religious loyalties as lightly as his political ones, for in 1654 he contracted a very favourable marriage with Dorothy, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/562/', "Arthur Annesley, the future earl of Anglesey")</script>, an alliance which placed him firmly among the new Anglo-Irish protestant establishment. There were four children of this marriage: Arthur (died in Waterford), Dorothy (died in London), John, and James.<br>
<br>The Restoration brought prosperity to Curraghmore. In 1661 Power was appointed governor of the city and county of Waterford and elected MP for the county. He succeeded his father as Baron le Power in 1665. A letter at Curraghmore from Lord Anglesey to his daughter, dated 1 May 1666, shows how Anglicized the family had become:<blockquote>I am glad to find by your husband that you have chosen an English nurse for the child you go with. He writes me word that he is upon making his house English. &hellip; I wish you had a good chaplain and then I doubt not God would bless all the rest. (cited in Girouard, 257&#150;8)</blockquote>Power's sister Catherine married in 1658 John FitzGerald of Dromana, proprietor of the vast estate of Decies in the western half of the county. They had one child, a daughter Catherine. Upon the deaths of her mother in 1660 and her father in 1664, guardianship of the little heiress passed to her uncle Richard. In May 1673 Richard made a bold stroke to unite the Curraghmore and Dromana estates by marrying his ward and niece to his eldest surviving son, John. Catherine was about twelve and her cousin a mere seven, but Archbishop Sheldon allowed a marriage ceremony to be performed before him in Lambeth Chapel. In October Power was created earl of Tyrone and Viscount Decies (the title formerly borne by the FitzGeralds and now given by courtesy to the child-bridegroom).<br>
<br>In May 1675 Catherine appeared again before Sheldon and repudiated the contract. She was then kept under house arrest by Lord Anglesey, but on Easter eve 1677 she escaped from his house and was married the same day to Edward Villiers, eldest son of the third Viscount Grandison. Chancery proceedings followed, and Tyrone was forced to give up the title-deeds of the Dromana estate, and his family to vacate the Decies title. The case formed an important precedent in cases regarding the validity of child marriages.<br>
<br>Tyrone's skill in walking the religious tightrope turned against him in 1679 when he was accused of involvement in the Popish Plot. He was indicted at Waterford in August 1679 and again in March 1680, and taken to England, where his impeachment was decided on by the House of Commons and he was imprisoned in the gatehouse at Westminster. He remained there until the beginning of 1684 when he was released on bail. Public reaction against the plot, and the king's death, saved him from further trouble on that score.<br>
<br>Tyrone's protestantism did not survive the accession of James II. He became colonel of a regiment of foot, was made a privy councillor in May 1686, and was lieutenant of the county and city of Waterford. He sat as a peer in the Irish parliament of May 1689, at which most of the protestant landowners were attainted. With his regiment he took part in the battle of the Boyne and the siege of Waterford in July 1690. On the approach of King William's army Tyrone's son and heir John Power fled to the royal camp at Carrick-on-Suir, where he obtained from the king a letter confirming that he was and had always been a protestant, and had been &#145;extremely oppressed&#146; by his father on account of his religion. The king's support undoubtedly saved Curraghmore once again from confiscation.<br>
<br>Upon the surrender of Waterford the Jacobite force there joined the defenders of Cork, where they soon found themselves under siege from John Churchill, later duke of Marlborough. The defence of Cork, brave as it was, proved to be a rash mistake, and in order to prevent an all-out Williamite assault Tyrone and Lord Rycault negotiated terms of surrender. They were harsh: the entire garrison of about 4000 men became prisoners of war on 28 September and were shipped off to England. Prison conditions for the ordinary soldiers were grim and many members of Tyrone's regiment died of malnutrition and disease. The senior officers were lodged in the Tower of London, where Tyrone died on 14 October 1690. He was buried on 3 November at Farnborough in the Annesley vault.<br>
<br>Tyrone was succeeded by his elder son John, second earl (hero of the celebrated &#145;Beresford ghost story&#146;), who died unmarried in 1693. Tyrone's younger son, James, now succeeded as third earl, but died without a male heir in 1704. The earldom of Tyrone then became extinct, while the barony of le Power passed to a different branch. Curraghmore was inherited by James's daughter Catherine, who in 1717 married Sir Marcus Beresford; their descendants, the marquesses of Waterford, still occupy Curraghmore. By his energy and resourcefulness&#151;and opportunism&#151;Tyrone restored the ailing fortunes of his family and preserved them through turbulent times. To this end he was apparently prepared to sacrifice religion, principles, and the happiness of his children. However, in the final phase of his public life&#151;his role in the defence of Cork and the negotiations for its surrender&#151;he displayed courage and nobility.<br>
