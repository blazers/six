<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  James  fitz Thomas</span>, <i>styled</i> fifteenth earl of Desmond <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>the <i>s&uacute;g&aacute;n</i> earl of Desmond]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1608?), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas fitz James Fitzgerald, known as Thomas Roe or Red Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1595). His mother may have been a daughter of David, Viscount Roche, or Ellice, daughter of Richard, first Baron Power of Curraghmore, co. Waterford, or a daughter of Theobold Butler, third baron of Cahir. Sir Thomas was bastardized when his father <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9560/', "James fitz John Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond")</script>, annulled his marriage to Joan, daughter of Maurice, Lord Roche, as Joan was his grandniece. James remarried, and when he died in 1558 he was succeeded as fourteenth earl by Gerald, eldest son of his second marriage.<br>
<br>At the outset of the first Desmond rebellion, initiated by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9562/', "James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald")</script> in 1569, Sir Thomas supported the rebellion but soon changed his mind and was thereafter actively engaged in prosecuting the rebels. James fitz Thomas and his father were steadfast in their loyalty to the crown during the second Desmond rebellion (1579&#150;83), also instigated by James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald. In 1581 James petitioned the queen for his father to be made earl in place of Gerald as a means of removing support from Gerald, but the idea was not acted upon. Gerald was killed on 11 November 1583, and the crown determined to dissolve the earldom, this being accomplished by the act of attainder passed by the Irish parliament in 1586. With that, James's hopes of ever becoming earl seemed to have died. Four years later James and his father were reported to be very poor.<br>
<br>In 1598, however, the situation changed when James fitz Thomas proclaimed himself earl. He was known as the <i>s&uacute;g&aacute;n</i> (straw rope) earl from then on. Taking advantage of the increasing antipathy in the province to the English undertakers in the Munster plantation, and the presence in Munster of rebel forces led by Captain Richard Tyrrell and Owney MacRory O'More, who had been sent there by Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, himself then in rebellion, James notified Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, in October 1598 that he would now forcibly take what he considered to be his by right, having failed to get legal redress from the queen. Within days his followers had spoiled the barony of Buttevant in co. Cork, and later that same month his forces were reputed to number over 3000 men. The rebels quickly established control over the province, destroying the Munster plantation, and forcing the English undertakers to seek refuge in some towns and castles. In May to June 1599 Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, the recently arrived lord lieutenant, campaigned in Munster, where he captured Caher Castle. However, James refused to engage his men against Essex's troops, only once assaulting them at Finniterstown, co. Limerick, between Rathkeale and Croom. Subsequently James agreed a truce with Essex, during which he captured Castlemaine Castle following a siege of almost a year.<br>
<br>In February 1600 James fitz Thomas was confirmed by Tyrone as earl of Desmond at a rebel gathering at Inishcarra, co. Cork, while the next month Tyrone appointed him commander of the Old English rebels in Munster. Sir George Carew, the newly appointed lord president of Munster, stabilized the situation, helped by Tyrone's return to Ulster, and in June James was captured by Dermot O'Connor who had agreed a fee of &pound;1000 with Carew for delivering James. James was taken to the castle at Castlelishen, co. Cork, but was freed by a rebel force on the night of 25/26 June before Carew arrived from Kilmallock. He escaped capture the following October by Captain Graeme in the Aherlow woods. Such was the concern over the continuing rebellion that in October, at Carew's instigation, the crown sent James Fitzgerald, the elder son of Gerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, over to Ireland as earl of Desmond in order to draw the allegiance of the Desmond Geraldines away from James. James Fitzgerald, known as the Tower Earl or the Queen's Earl, failed to attract appreciable local support and was back in London by March 1601.<br>
<br>James fitz Thomas thus successfully saw off his first cousin, but in May 1601 he was finally captured by Edmund FitzGibbon, the white knight, who discovered him in a cave near Mitchelstown, co. Cork. Handed over to Sir George Thornton, the provost marshal of Munster, he was conveyed to Carew's castle at Shandon, co. Cork. Carew initially considered employing James against Tyrone but gave up the idea and instead had him conducted to England by Sir Anthony Cooke in August 1601. Once in England, James was placed in the Tower of London where, in 1602, his imprisonment cost &pound;156 p.a. James appears to have first married Margaret, daughter of John, third Baron Power of Curraghmore, in 1585, and subsequently Ellen, daughter of Piers Butler and widow of Maurice FitzGibbon, brother of Edmund, the white knight. He had no children. James, who rebelled to claim a forfeited earldom which had been denied to both him and his father, may have died in the Tower in 1608; he was perhaps buried in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower, although this is uncertain.<br>
