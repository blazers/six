<span class="headword">Stone,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1602?, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">Independent minister in America</span>, was born in Hertford, the son of John Stone, freeholder, and possibly baptized at All Saints', Hertford, on 30 July 1602. Having attended Hale's Grammar School in Hertford he matriculated as a sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 19 April 1620 and graduated BA in 1624. He was ordained at Peterborough in July 1626 and continued his studies under Richard Blackerby, a deprived minister, at Ashen, Essex. In 1627 he proceeded MA and was made a curate at Stisted, also in Essex, becoming part of puritan clerical society in the county. Within the next few years he married. He and his wife, who may have been called Mary, had at least one son, John.<br>
<br>Having been silenced for nonconformity in 1630, in the same year Stone was recommended for a lectureship in Towcester, Northamptonshire, a preaching post funded by one Dr Wilson. His preaching evidently met with some success for the Laudian Robert Sibthorpe reported to Sir John Lambe that the congregation had &#145;been infected by Stoner a lecturer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records of the Borough of Northampton</span>, 2.397). Stone was accordingly suspended for nonconformity in 1633. He offered shelter to a friend, Thomas Hooker, a minister in flight from the ecclesiastical authorities, and shortly after both participated in a clerical conference in Ockley, Surrey, where they and John Cotton persuaded some other ministers to stop conforming to ceremonies they found offensive.<br>
<br>All three were travelling south to board the <i>Griffen</i>, in which they set sail for New England in July 1633. After landing at Boston, Massachusetts, on 4 September, Hooker and Stone moved on to Newtown, in the same colony, where Stone was chosen as teacher to Hooker's pastor. In 1636 Hooker and Stone moved south-west with most of the inhabitants to found a new settlement on the Connecticut, named Hartford after Stone's birthplace. This took the colonists into less familiar territory and conflict arose with the Pequot peoples. The following year Stone served as a chaplain to Major John Mason's expedition against the Pequot inhabitants, and he went on to train the Pequot John Minor in his own home as a missionary and interpreter. He also worked with his later foe William Goodwin in a failed attempt to negotiate a compromise over Connecticut's differences with the sachem Sowheag. In 1640 his first wife died. The following year he married his second wife, Elizabeth Allen; the couple had five children, one boy and four girls, who outlived their father.<br>
<br>Stone's primary role in Hartford was as teacher to the church, and this is reflected in his lesser publication, an unremarkable catechism which was printed twenty years after his death. He also composed a &#145;Whole body of divinity&#146; which was to be transcribed by other, junior, ministers. The first systematic theology written on North American soil, it was sent to England for publication but it was never printed; one complete manuscript and three partial copies survive. Stone is better known, however, as a contributor to the transatlantic controversy on church government of the 1640s and 1650s in which Hooker had already engaged. One of the texts criticized by Hooker was by the minor English presbyterian Samuel Hudson. Hudson had responded in print, claiming that the congregational churches could not be recognized as individual ecclesiological entities, but since this response appeared after Hooker's death Stone published a painstaking reply, entitled <span class="italic">A Congregational Church is a Catholike Visible Church</span> (1652) which defended congregational autonomy.<br>
<br>Stone cannot, however, be seen as representative of a homogeneous New England way. He made considerable claims for clerical authority, most famously describing congregationalism as &#145;a speaking Aristocracy in the face of a silent democracy&#146;  (Mather, 3.118). This faith in the authority of the clergy was reflected in his unpublished &#145;Discourse against the binding persons to make a relation of the time and manner of their conversion in order to their admission into the church&#146;. Most New England churches expected candidates to give an account of their conversion as a condition for their acceptance as members of the church. Stone's rejection of this practice extended Thomas Hooker's similar rejection touched upon in his own published work.<br>
<br>Stone took this theoretical position into his practice. After Hooker's death in 1647, Stone served the Hartford church on his own and his sense of clerical autocracy eventually led to a schism within the congregation. Attempts to secure him an assistant provoked a bitter quarrel with William Goodwin, a lay ruling elder, and led to the notorious Hartford church controversy, a furore lasting from 1653 to 1659 which drew attention across the colonies. Having failed to assert his authority, Stone resigned his office. He was then reinstated but looked to reassert himself by refusing to administer communion. The conflict culminated in a considerable portion of the congregation splitting to form a new church at Hadley, Massachusetts.<br>
<br>In a rather more controlled, although not trouble-free, environment, Stone participated actively in the New England synods, representing Hartford church in 1637, 1643, 1646&#150;8, and 1657. He was an early advocate of the half-way covenant, the attempt to make the church membership more inclusive which would lessen the attention paid to church &#145;relations&#146; and in turn lessen Stone's fears of lay expressions of heterodox ideas in church. Stone died at Hartford on 20 July 1663; his wife, Elizabeth, survived him.<br>
