<span class="headword">Owen,  Josiah</span>  (1710/11&#150;1755), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was the grandson of John Owen of Aber-nant, Carmarthenshire. He was a nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21012/', "James Owen (1654&#150;1706)")</script>, dissenting minister of Shrewsbury, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20987/', "Charles Owen (d. 1746)")</script>, dissenting minister of Warrington. He is said to have been the son of their eldest brother, David Owen, dissenting minister of Henllan, Carmarthenshire, who died on 7 October 1710, aged fifty-nine. He may have been a posthumous son, but has probably been confused with David Owen's son Jeremiah, who was educated by James Owen, succeeded his father at Henllan, and after various pastorates in England died in America.<br>
<br>Josiah was educated by his uncle Charles Owen at Warrington, and then at Carmarthen from 1725 to 1730. His first ministerial settlement was at Bridgnorth, Shropshire. As minister there he received a grant from the Presbyterian Fund Board between March 1733 and December 1739. He then ministered for short periods at Stone and possibly Walsall in Staffordshire. About this time he is supposed to have entered into a controversy with the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Richard Smalbroke, publishing anonymously <span class="italic">Remarks on two charges: deliver'd by the Lord Bishop of L&#151;d and C&#151;y, to the clergy of his diocese</span> (1738). This was answered by Smalbroke in print in the same year. Described as &#145;young Mr. Owen of Warrington&#146; by the diarist Richard Kay of Bury, Owen gave a sermon to the Bury protestant dissenters on 2 September 1739. He soon became minister of Blackwater Street Chapel, Rochdale, Lancashire, the earliest evidence of his settlement there being Richard Kay's diary entry concerning a conversation with &#145;the Revnd. Mr Owen from Rochdale&#146; on 18 October 1739  (Kay, 29).<br>
<br>Owen frequently preached at Bury as well as Rochdale and, in the tradition of his uncle Charles Owen, assiduously supported the Hanoverian cause. His sermons warned of French, Catholic, and absolutist threats to England's liberties. He preached at Bury Chapel on 30 November 1740 from <span class="roman">Amos</span> 3: 6, &#145;God is blowing his Trumpet in the City, is threatening England and all Europe with War and Famine&#146;. He gave a thanksgiving sermon at Bury Chapel on 24 July 1743 for &#145;the late Victory our Forces have had over the French Army at Dettingen in Germany&#146;  (Kay, 39, 65), and this sermon appeared in print in 1753. A staunch whig, he celebrated the &#145;glorious revolution&#146;, publishing <span class="italic">National gratitude just tribute for national deliverances; exemplified in the discovery of the Powder Plot and accession of the prince of Orange to the throne, a sermon preach'd to a society of protestant dissenters at Rochdale, Nov. 5, 1742</span> (1742), and is known to have preached another 5 November sermon in 1744. His ministry was successful, and his chapel was enlarged in 1743. By March 1745 he was preaching the weekly lecture at Bolton, where &#145;he is lately chose Lecturer there instead of Mr Abraham Dawson from Rivington who has lately conformed&#146;  (ibid., 94). About 1750 he is said to have prevailed with the provincial meeting of the associated ministers of Lancashire &#145;to discontinue the customary questions respecting the internal state of congregations&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Owen is chiefly remembered for his attacks on Jacobite and nonjuring principles; these led to harsh exchanges with Thomas Deacon and John Byrom. Owen had already controverted with Thomas Cattell, the chaplain of the Rochdale corporation, a Jacobite club at which Byrom is known to have been present. Tensions were high in the area in November 1745 when Prince Charles Edward Stuart was marching south, and many Presbyterians in Manchester and the surrounding area made themselves scarce during the brief Jacobite interlude. Owen was known to be lodging with Richard Kay at Baldingstone, Bury, when the news came through on 4 January 1746 that Carlisle had surrendered to the duke of Cumberland. In October 1746 Manchester officially celebrated the Jacobite defeat, and Owen assumed the role of &#145;faithful Monitor&#146; of the Jacobites in Manchester.<br>
<br>An anonymous letter by Owen from Manchester, dated 6 October 1746, was published in the <span class="italic">Whitehall Evening Post</span> for 11 October 1746. In it he claims &#145;Jacobite, non-juring, and even popish principles are now making a greater progress here than ever&#146;, and he ridicules Deacon for doffing his hat to the severed heads of the rebels on the Manchester exchange, one of whom was Deacon's son, Thomas  (&#145;Letter from Manchester&#146;, 579). Owen preached a thanksgiving sermon, subsequently published as <span class="italic">All is well, or, The defeat of the late rebellion &hellip; a sermon preached at Rochdale on Oct. 9th, being the day appointed for a public thanksgiving</span> (1746). Byrom responded to Owen's letter with a piece in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> ridiculing Owen as Don Quixote tilting at &#145;innocent fulling-mills, chimeras of his own distempered brain&#146;  (ibid.). Owen attacked Byrom again as a promoter of &#145;the good old cause of popery and slavery&#146; and accused the Manchester nonjurors of worshipping the &#145;rebel skull divinities fix'd up at the Exchange&#146; in the same way the Catholic church venerated saints, as martyrs  (Philopatriae, 688, 690). Byrom replied, charging Owen with &#145;false reasoning, partiality, bitterness, and fury&#146;  (&#145;Reply to Philopatriae's answer&#146;, 76&#150;7).<br>
<br>Owen raised the stakes by directing at Byrom <span class="italic">Jacobite and non-juring principles, freely examined, in a letter to the master-tool of the faction at Manchester, with remarks on &hellip; a Christian catechism &amp; said to be wrote by Dr. D&#151;c&#151;n</span> (1747). In this he admits to being the author of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> letters. In its preface Owen says his Rochdale thanksgiving sermon and his letter to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, together with Nichol's sermon, provoked Byrom to produce his <span class="italic">Epistle to a Friend</span>, which contains the lines &#145;Leave to the low-bred O&#151;ns of the Age Sense to belie, and Loyalty to rage&#146;. Owen retorted in the preface: &#145;The Master-Tool was ordered to his Post, from whence he has since been preaching up Politeness with Dunghill-Breeding, and under Pretence of advocating for the true Catholic Church &hellip; been labouring to introduce the Worship of Dunghill Gods&#146;. Owen attacked Byrom &#145;for his love of scribbling verses &hellip; for his devotion to mysticism and Jacob Behmen; and above all, for his personal dealings in former days with the Pretender at Avignon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems of John Byrom</span>, 1.2, 360). Byrom subsequently brought out a broadside against Owen entitled <span class="italic">Sir Lowbred O&#151;n, or, The Hottentot Knight</span>. Intended to be sung in the taverns to the tune of the &#145;Abbot of Canterbury&#146;, Byrom ensured that the debate remained in the gutter with couplets like<blockquote>
<div>That Son of a &#151;, and that Son of a &#151;,<br>
</div>
<div>Would never have struck me&#151;so quite to the Core.<br>
</div> (ibid., 358&#150;77)</blockquote>Deacon then sought to vindicate himself in print. A letter written from Manchester on 18 April 1748 was first printed in the <span class="italic">Chester Courant</span> (26 April 1748) and subsequently as &#145;Dr Deacon's vindication of himself&#146; in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (18, 1748, 206&#150;7). Owen demonstrated his rebarbative powers in <span class="italic">Dr. Deacon, try'd before his own tribunal, or, An examination of the several facts deny'd by him in the &#145;Gentleman's Magazine&#146; for May last; by those very rules laid down in his catechism for the conviction of offenders, in a letter to the said gentleman</span> (1748).<br>
<br>With Byrom's move to London in early 1748, however, much of the fire went out of the exchange. On 7 April 1748 Byrom could comment on Owen's latest attack as follows: &#145;thank &hellip; friend O&#151;n for his care of my fame and reputation; I am hardly at leisure to mind him, or perhaps I might thank him myself&#146;  (Hancox, 201). Owen was debilitated by a severe illness early in 1750, and the last mention of him in Kay's diary is in May 1750. His ministry at Rochdale closed on 14 June 1752. He became the minister of the Presbyterian congregation at Ellenthorpe, Aldborough parish, near Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, where he died in 1755, aged forty-four. His will records &#145;I always bore my living testimony (to my great temporal loss in favour of virtue and national devotion) against the wild Phrenzy of superstition&#146;. He was buried at Aldborough on 1 October 1755, and had asked for a company of poor men to be paid to bury him on the north side of the parish church without any form of ceremony.<br>
