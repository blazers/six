<span class="headword">Bard,  Henry</span>, first Viscount Bellomont <span class="st"> [Bellamont]</span>  (1615/16&#150;1656), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and diplomat</span>, came of an old-established Lincolnshire family, and was the younger son of George Bard (<i>d</i>. 1616), vicar of Staines, Middlesex, and his wife, Susan, daughter of John Dudley. A scholar at Eton College from about 1628, Bard was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, on 23 August 1633, where he became a fellow in 1636; he graduated BA in 1637 and proceeded MA in 1641. His restless and roving disposition led him to travel extensively, mainly on foot, in western Europe, Turkey, Palestine, Arabia, and Egypt, where he acquired (allegedly stole from a mosque) a handsome <span class="roman">Koran</span>, which he later (on 28 May 1644) presented to King's College. He sent a detailed account of his travels to a King's contemporary, Dr Charles Mason.<br>
<br>Bard returned to England about 1642, and on the outbreak of the civil war his reputation as a traveller and linguist secured him a colonel's commission, possibly through the influence of the queen, Henrietta Maria. He later told parliament &#145;that he had taken up arms neither for religion &hellip; nor for that mousetrap the laws, but to re-establish the king on his throne&#146;  (Bence-Jones, 187). He was knighted on 22 November 1643 and created an Oxford DCL the same year. Having gained the confidence of Prince Rupert, he was sent to Ireland, where he raised two regiments of foot. At Cheriton, Hampshire, on 29 March 1644, against orders, and &#145;with more youthful courage than soldier-like discretion&#146;  (Adair, 140), he impetuously charged the roundhead cavalry and his whole regiment was either killed or captured, Bard himself losing the use of an arm. After a brief imprisonment (April/May 1644) he was granted the reversion to the offices of governor of Guernsey and captain of Cornet Castle. He was created a baronet on 8 October 1644, joined the king at Oxford, and was given the command of a brigade. In 1645 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. in or before 1668), daughter of Sir William Gardiner of Peckham, Surrey; they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Early in 1645 Bard was governor of Campden House, Gloucestershire; according to Clarendon he &#145;exercised an illimited tyranny over the whole country&#146;  (Porter, 30), ordering the constable of Kineton to be thrown into a pond. When the garrison was withdrawn in May he burnt the house to the ground to prevent its occupation by the enemy. After playing a distinguished role in the capture of Leicester on 30 May he commanded a division at Naseby with Sir George Lisle. Shortly afterwards he was appointed governor of Worcester, and on 1 November 1645 he threatened local constables who were late in paying their assessments with &#145;a troop of unsanctified horse (to) &hellip; fire your houses &hellip; hang up your bodies and scare your ghosts&#146;  (Whitelocke, 1.181). On 18 July 1645 Bard was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Bard of Dromboy, co. Eastmeath, and Viscount Bellomont, co. Dublin (an attempt to latinize Ballymount). While sailing to Ireland in December 1646 he was captured by a parliamentarian vessel and brought back, a prisoner, to England. The following year he was released on condition he left the country&#151;possibly through the good offices of his elder brother, Maximilian, a wealthy London mercer who provided horses for the parliamentarian army, and on whom Bellomont appears to have been financially dependent throughout his life.<br>
<br>Upon moving with his family to the exiled court of Charles II, where he became a Catholic, Bellomont was arrested on 12 May 1649 at The Hague and charged with the murder of Isaac Dorislaus, the Commonwealth's ambassador; the charge was soon dropped. In 1653 Bellomont was sent by the king as his envoy to Shah Abbas II of Persia, in the hope of raising money for the royalist cause from payment of an alleged debt owed to the English crown for naval aid in the capture of Hormoz (1622) and from diverting to royal use the East India Company's share of the customs at Gombroon. His journeys were, long afterwards, narrated by Niccolao Manucci, a Venetian boy befriended by Bellomont and allowed to accompany him. Travelling in disguise through Turkey and Armenia, they reached Tabriz early in September 1654. But though the shah was friendly (Bellomont named his youngest daughter Persiana) he proved dilatory over a pecuniary settlement. After more than a year at Esfahan, Bellomont left with calculated brusqueness, and on his own initiative proceeded to India to seek aid from the Mughal, Shah Jahan. He reached Surat in January 1656, but on 20 June he died, probably from heat apoplexy, at Hodal, between Agra and Delhi, where he was buried; fifteen months later his body was reburied at Agra, probably in the Roman Catholic cemetery. Anthony Wood alleged he had hoped to become grand master of the knights of Malta.<br>
<br>Bellomont left his family in straitened circumstances: his widow petitioned the king for a pension in the autumn of 1660 and she seems to have been aided by his old college. Of Bard's children, Charles Rupert, his son (1648&#150;1667) and Charles II's godson, was killed fighting the French on St Kitts; with his death the viscountcy became extinct. Frances, his eldest daughter (1646?&#150;1708), was (<i>c</i>.1664&#150;7) the mistress of Prince Rupert; their son, Dudley Bard (1666?&#150;1686), was sent by Rupert to Eton College and died at the siege of Buda. Although a Catholic and Jacobite supporter, Frances later resided at the court of Hanover as a close friend of the Electress Sophia, Rupert's youngest sister.<br>
<br>Bellomont was more than the heavy-handed, licentious soldier depicted by Clarendon, and a picturesque, intrepid adventurer. Manucci says that he treated him like a son, and the Dutch East India Company's surgeon at Surat found him &#145;very well-informed, modest and courteous&#146;  (Bence-Jones, 192). A manuscript by John Hall (<i>c</i>.1660) at King's College calls him &#145;a man of a very personable body and of a stout and undaunted courage&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 105), and even the waspish Wood, who says he always lived &#145;high&#146;, pronounced Bellomont &#145;a compact body of vanity and ambition, yet proper, robust and comely&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.62).<br>
