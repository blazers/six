<span class="headword">Sheldon,  Edward</span>  (1599&#150;1687), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born on 23 April 1599 at Beoley, Worcestershire, the third of the six children of Edward Sheldon (<i>bap</i>. 1566, <i>d</i>. 1643) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1565&#150;1630), daughter of Thomas Markham of Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Mary Griffin. He became a gentleman commoner at Gloucester Hall, Oxford, about 1613, and was admitted to Gray's Inn, London, on 1 March 1620. He then returned to Oxford, matriculating as a member of University College on 19 November 1621. After travelling on the continent for several years, he returned to the family house at Stratton, near Cirencester, &#145;which at length he lost, or was forced to quit, for the cause of king Charles I and for his religion&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.206: 1). An Edward Sheldon was one of the garrison of Worcester when it surrendered in July 1646 after attempting to hold the city for Charles.<br>
<br>Sheldon's translations provide evidence of his committed Catholicism. His first published work was <span class="italic">The Holy Life of Monsr. Renty</span> (1658), which Wood describes as having been &#145;mangled by an Irish priest when it went to press&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.206: 2). He went on to publish <span class="italic">The Rule of Catholick Faith</span> (1660), an English version of Fran&ccedil;ois V&eacute;ron's <span class="italic">R&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la foy catholique</span>, and two later translations from French, <span class="italic">Christian Thoughts for every Day in the Month</span> and <span class="italic">Counsels of Wisdom</span>, were both published in London in 1680. Of these, his translation of V&eacute;ron's work, later described as &#145;one of the most hazardous and difficult [tasks] a mere layman could have undertaken&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catholic Miscellany</span>), appears to have been most controversial; although it too was printed in London, in 1660, its title-page claims publication in Paris.<br>
<br>Sheldon married Mary, daughter of Lionel Wake, a merchant of Antwerp and of Pedington, Northamptonshire. His Catholic and royalist connections remained strong. Of their fifteen children, Bridget and Teresa became nuns, and another daughter, Mary, married the royalist Sir Samuel Tuke. Both <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66589/', "Dominic Sheldon")</script> and Ralph (<i>d</i>. 1723) served James II, while Lionel (<i>d</i>. 1678) was a Benedictine monk and chaplain to James's first wife, Anne. Ralph, his wife Elizabeth, and his brother Edward were among the Catholics who paid for the keep of Archbishop Plunket when he was imprisoned in London, and witnessed the removal of Plunket's head and arms as relics after his execution. Two other daughters, Frances and Katharine, were maids of honour and dressers to Charles II's wife, Catherine, to whom Sheldon dedicated his <span class="italic">Counsels of Wisdom</span>, &#145;Being desirous in these distracted times to offer something that is serious, and may invite People and direct them to the way of Virtue&#146;  (1680, sig. A2<i>r</i>). One of the copies in the Bodleian Library was given to Anthony Wood by Frances Sheldon. Sheldon died at his house in St James's Street, Westminster, on 27 March 1687, and was buried under the chapel at Somerset House.<br>
