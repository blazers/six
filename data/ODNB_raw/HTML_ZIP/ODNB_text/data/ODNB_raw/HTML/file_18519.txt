<span class="headword">Meilan,  Mark Anthony</span>  (<em>c.</em>1743&#150;1813), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born apparently in England. His family was possibly of Swiss protestant or French origin. Meilan left a position in the Post Office to become, in his own words, an &#145;indefatigable Labourer in the Vineyard of Instruction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holy Writ Familiarized to Juvenile Conceptions</span>, 1791, 1.i) who, for over forty years, offered private instruction in languages, arts, mathematics, and sciences. In 1776 he was keeping an academy in Charles Square, Hoxton, London. Meilan was an equally indefatigable author of works on English grammar and shorthand, drama and poetry, as well as moral and didactic books for children that reflected his wish to &#145;convert instruction into pastime, and seduce them as it were to virtue&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Friend of Youth</span>, 1788, 1.ii).<br>
<br>His first work, <span class="italic">Stenography, or, Short-Hand Improved</span> (1764), was a more curvilinear&#151;and at 3<i>s</i>. cheaper&#151;version of Thomas Gurney's shorthand (based on that of William Mason), the best system then extant, according to Meilan, who employed a simplified alphabet, used different symbols for five letters, and altered Gurney's method for writing vowels. On 4 October 1768 Meilan married Elizabeth Newton in the parish church of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, he at that time being resident in that parish and she in the parish of St Andrew Holborn. They had a large family.<br>
<br>Having from youth nursed the ambition to be a playwright, Meilan submitted in turn three tragedies (<span class="italic">Northumberland</span>, <span class="italic">Emilia</span>, and <span class="italic">The Friends</span>&#151;derivative of plays by Shakespeare and Nicholas Rowe and stories in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>) to David Garrick and George Colman. They were not accepted, but subscription allowed their publication as <span class="italic">The Dramatic Works of Mark Anthony Meilan</span> (1771?), with a preface containing a sharp but entertaining rebuttal to the &#145;despots of the drama&#146;. The published plays met no happier fate: &#145;Such pieces &hellip; would have been dismissed with contempt even by the manager of a company of strollers acting in a barn&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, 31.228). In prefaces to his later works Meilan attacked those who &#145;exercise the tooth of surly criticism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Book of Righteousness</span>, 1800?, vii). Better, if mixed, reception met his verse adaptation of F&eacute;nelon's <span class="italic">Les aventures de T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</span> (<span class="italic">The Adventures of Telemachus, an Epic Poem</span>, 4 vols., 1776; 2nd edn, 2 vols., 1792&#150;4).<br>
<br>Meilan was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1778 and in the following year the bishop of London ordained him priest and licensed him as curate to the rector of Ilford Parva, Essex, at a salary of &pound;30 per annum. He later served as curate of St John-at-Wapping, and, from 1809, was assistant minister of St Mary's Newington, London. He is listed in <span class="italic">A Biographical Dictionary of the Living Authors</span> (1816). Meilan, then living at Kennington Lane, made his will on 16 June 1813, leaving everything he owned to his unmarried daughters Marin and Elizabeth. His will was proved on 3 August, at which time he was described as &#145;late of Francis Street, Newington&#146;.<br>
<br>The popularity in England of French moral and didactic literature for children inspired Meilan to direct his literary ambitions towards what he often termed the &#145;rising generation&#146;, producing between 1786 and 1800 five works (a total of forty-four volumes) on this and religious subjects. <span class="italic">The Children's Friend, Consisting of Apt Tales, Short Dialogues, and Moral Dramas</span> (24 vols., 1786), in small format &#145;suited to the little hands of children&#146;  (24.163), was Meilan's translation and adaptation of the popular <span class="italic">L'ami des enfans</span> (1782&#150;3) by Arnaud Berquin.<br>
