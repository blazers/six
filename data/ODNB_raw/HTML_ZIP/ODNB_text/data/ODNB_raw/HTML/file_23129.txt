<span class="headword">Ranew,  Nathanael</span>  (1602?&#150;1677), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 10 June 1617, graduated BA in 1621, and proceeded MA in 1624. He was incorporated at Oxford on 10 July 1627 and ordained deacon and priest in Peterborough in September of that year.<br>
<br>About 1644 Ranew became minister of St Andrew Hubbard, Little Eastcheap, London, a rectory that had been sequestered from Richard Chambers. The following year he was named as rector of West Hanningfield, Essex. On 29 February 1648 he was instituted under parliamentary order to the vicarage of Felsted, Essex, vacant after the death of Samuel Wharton. There he was &#145;well beloved&#146; by the earl and countess of Warwick, who lived at Leighs Priory, near Felsted  (Kennet, 890). They bestowed upon Ranew &pound;20 per annum during his lifetime. On the division of Essex into classes the same year Ranew was placed in the eleventh, or East Hinckford, classis. He also subscribed to <span class="italic">A Testimony of the ministers in the province of Essex, to the trueth of Jesus Christ, and to the solemn league and covenant; as also against the errors, heresies, and blasphemies of these times</span> (1648) and in 1649 he signed <span class="italic">The Essex Watchmen's Watchword</span>, which sought to explain the ministers' original opposition to the crown and their current opposition to sectaries and the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. In 1650 Ranew was reported by the triers as &#145;an able, godly minister&#146;  (Davids, 389).<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, on 1 March 1661 Ranew secured the vicarage of Coggeshall, Essex, as a precaution in case of difficulties at Felsted, but did not take up the living. After being ejected from Felsted in September 1662, Ranew settled in Billericay. His <span class="italic">Solitude Improved by Divine Meditation</span> (1670), dedicated to the countess of Warwick, reflects his concern for proper preparation for death. On 30 April 1672 he took out a licence as a presbyterian teacher in the house of a Mr Finch, in Billericay, which was the same day licensed as a presbyterian meeting-house. Ranew died in Billericay in 1677 and was buried there on 17 March. His widow, Susanna, renounced administration of the estate in favour of Ranew's son, also Nathanael, bookseller and stationer, of the King's Arms, St Paul's Churchyard, who had published his father's book. Richard Ranew, who proceeded MA from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1660, was possibly another son.<br>
