<span class="headword">Grayson,  (Albert) Victor</span>  (<em>b. </em>1881), <span class="occ">politician</span>, generally known as Victor Grayson, was registered as having been born at 8 Taliesin Street, Liverpool on 5 September 1881. His father was given as William Grayson, a carpenter, and his mother as Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Craig (<i>d</i>. 1929). The circumstances of his birth remain disputed. Some sources  (for example Clark, <span class="italic">Labour's Lost Leader</span>, 156&#150;7) refer to rumours that these were not his natural parents, and that his father was an aristocrat.<br>
<br>Grayson's formal education was at St Mathew's Church of England School on Liverpool's Scotland Road; he then served an apprenticeship as a turner at the Bank Hall engine works. His mother was deeply religious; at the age of eighteen he began to attend the undenominational Bethel mission, and he later moved to the Hamilton Road mission. A talent for oratory became evident during his activities first as a Sunday school teacher, and then as an outdoor speaker. In the autumn of 1904 he entered the Home Missionary College in Manchester to train for the Unitarian ministry, and also attended classes at the University of Manchester. Increasingly involved in socialist activities, he joined the Manchester central branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Unemployment was high in Manchester during 1905 and Grayson emerged as a popular and effective speaker at demonstrations. His passion for socialism replaced his religious commitment, and in July 1906 he withdrew from his course.<br>
<br>Grayson's subsequent political rise was meteoric. In significant respects his experience of the labour movement was narrow. He preferred the emotions of the platform to the humdrum tasks of political organization. He had no experience of trade unionism and could be critical of what he considered its narrowness of vision. But in the circumstances of 1906&#150;7, his revivalist socialism struck a telling chord among many activists of the ILP.<br>
<br>The general election of 1906 had produced a Parliamentary Labour Party of thirty members, several of whom identified themselves as socialists. ILP membership was increasing, and many new recruits were unhappy about the constraints intrinsic to the ILP's alliance with the trade unions. These enthusiasts wished to attack Liberal seats in by-elections. In the context of these sentiments the Mancunian roots of Grayson's politics were perhaps significant. The conurbation's socialists included many who were critical of the Labour Party's caution and wished for an alternative socialist alliance of the ILP and the Social Democratic Federation (Social Democratic Party from 1908).<br>
<br>During 1906 Grayson became a frequent and enthusiastically received speaker in the Colne Valley, a safe Liberal seat to the south-west of Huddersfield. A West Riding constituency of mill villages, nonconformist chapels, and moorland, it included the well-established Colne Valley Labour League. This was essentially a network of ILP branches and clubs; local trade unionism was sparse. When a by-election was called in June 1907 Grayson was adopted as the league's candidate. He was not endorsed by the national Labour Party. Formally this resulted from the lack of a local Labour Representation Committee, itself symptomatic of trade union weakness, but there appear also to have been doubts about Grayson's suitability not least on grounds of his inexperience.<br>
<br>Grayson's campaign combined orthodox Labour politics with revivalist oratory. His victory by 153 votes in a three-cornered contest held on 18 July 1907 led him to a contrasting verdict&#151;&#145;this epoch making victory has been won for pure revolutionary socialism&#146;  (Thompson, 22). Many activists felt that Grayson's victory demonstrated the feasibility of a radical alternative to established Labour politics, and he became symbolic of this discontent. His oratory expressed at socialist meetings could seem threatening to other Labour politicians. Attempts to negotiate his inclusion within the Parliamentary Labour Party failed. The gulf was revealed dramatically on successive days in October 1908 when he twice flouted parliamentary procedure to demand a debate on unemployment. Prior to his first removal from the chamber, he castigated Labour members&#151;&#145;you are traitors to your class&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 4</span>, vol. 194, col. 497, 15 Oct 1908). His use of the parliamentary &#145;scene&#146; brought approval from George Bernard Shaw, but provoked predictable hostility from Labour members. Some responded by spreading rumours about Grayson's liking for alcohol and his enjoyment of luxuries. The ILP conference in 1909 revealed the limits of his influence. Many critics of the Labour Party leadership nevertheless remained committed to the basic strategy of an ILP&#150;trade union alliance. Grayson clearly was not; his journalism firstly for A. P. Orage's <span class="italic">New Age</span> and subsequently for Robert Blatchford's <span class="italic">Clarion</span> demonstrated a commitment to a socialist alternative. A book, <span class="italic">The Problem of Parliament</span> (1909), written with G. R. S. Taylor, presented parliament not as an instrument for reform but as a socialist platform.<br>
<br>Grayson's brief parliamentary career ended with the general election of January 1910. Even in Colne Valley his politics divided socialists, and in an election dominated by the Liberal issues of House of Lords reform and the people's budget, his socialist rhetoric could seem less compelling. His vote fell by 499 and he finished third. In the second 1910 election he stood for Kennington, south London, as a socialist, but polled only 408 votes. Throughout 1911 he campaigned for a new socialist party through his column in <span class="italic">The Clarion</span>. The Salford Unity Conference at the end of September elected him to the steering committee charged with the task of devising a party constitution. Yet his hopes for the consequential British Socialist Party (BSP) proved brief. The Social Democratic Party under H. M. Hyndman moved into the BSP en bloc and soon marginalized the ILP dissidents and <span class="italic">Clarion</span> readers that represented Grayson's support. By the spring of 1912 he had retired from the organization. His combination of passionate platform oratory and high living was lubricated increasingly by alcohol; his status within the socialist movement declined further.<br>
<br>On 7 November 1912 at Chelsea register office, describing his occupation as &#145;journalist&#146;, he married Ruth Nightingale (1886/7&#150;1918), an actress with the stage name of Ruth Norrey; she was the daughter of John Webster Nightingale, banker. The fragility of Grayson's health and the unpredictability of his wife's earnings meant poverty. During 1913 donations from political sympathizers allowed them to travel abroad in the hope of Grayson's recovery. After visiting Italy and, for a longer period, New York, they returned to Britain at the end of the year. A daughter was born in April 1914.<br>
<br>Grayson strongly supported Britain's entry into the war in August 1914. The influence of Robert Blatchford might have been significant; the result was to separate Grayson further from many of his sympathizers. In the spring of 1915 the Graysons left for Australia. Ruth had obtained a theatrical engagement and Victor spoke at meetings and wrote for political journals. Initially his pro-war views harmonized with those of the Australian labour party leadership, but the growth of anti-conscription feeling produced criticism. Similar problems confronted him when he arrived in New Zealand in 1916. Not only did his pro-conscription views prove unpopular, but his speeches could be marred by alcohol, and there were allegations of financial deception. In November 1916 he enlisted in the New Zealand expeditionary force, and he arrived in France in the following September. On 12 October 1917 he was wounded, and subsequently discharged, probably suffering from shell-shock. Early in 1918 he featured as a pro-war orator in alliance with the seamen's leader Havelock Wilson; the campaign was interrupted by his wife's death during childbirth in February.<br>
<br>This reappearance on public platforms was brief. Grayson subsequently lived in apparent affluence&#151;a contrast with his recent poverty&#151;in a West End flat. His associates included Maundy Gregory, the man at the heart of the post-war honours scandal. The significance of this relationship and the source of Grayson's income remain unknown; and then, probably in September 1920, began a greater mystery. Grayson disappeared. Subsequent sightings proved inconclusive; no death certificate was ever issued. Speculations have included murder at the hands of Gregory or his associates, a breakdown, or the construction of a new identity.<br>
<br>Beyond the unresolved mysteries stands the power of Grayson's spellbinding oratory. Often charming, and attractive to both men and women, his politics lacked depth. For his sympathizers he represented the hope of a better world that owed more to moral conversion than to legislation; for his detractors he represented the irrational, the destabilizing, and the potentially violent both as pre-war socialist and as wartime patriot. From one standpoint he is the flawed socialist hero; but his distinctive trajectory also illuminates specific and important themes within the Edwardian left. A character in a morality play, he was nevertheless very much a man of his time and place.<br>
