<span class="headword">Drysdale,  George</span>  (1824&#150;1904), <span class="occ">freethinker and advocate of contraception</span>, was born at 8 Royal Circus, Edinburgh, on 27 December 1824, the fourth son of the city treasurer and tory leader on Edinburgh council, Sir William Drysdale (1781&#150;1843), who was concerned with sanitary reform and was a correspondent of Edwin Chadwick. The five children of Sir William's two deceased wives lived at their Royal Circus house with Margaret Mary (1823&#150;1891), George, and Charles Robert, the children of his third wife, Elizabeth Copeland, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pew (1787&#150;1887), a widow with one other son. Lady Drysdale was known for her interest in literary and scientific people, and in Edinburgh George and Charles Drysdale met Charles Dickens, Francis Jeffrey (editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>), and the secular educationist and phrenologist George Combe. When Margaret Mary and her husband, Dr Edward Wickstead Lane (1822&#150;1891), moved in 1854 to their well-known hydro at Moor Park, Surrey, Lady Drysdale helped to manage it. The Malthusians Combe, James Stuart Laurie, and Alexander Bain, were, like George and Charles, frequent visitors, as was Charles Darwin.<br>
<br>George and Charles Drysdale were educated at Edinburgh Academy, George from 1835. George was particularly brilliant, dux of the school in 1841. About 1839, increasingly overwhelmed by his adolescent sexuality, George's reading convinced him that masturbation was bringing him to mental and physical breakdown. He entered Glasgow University in 1841&#150;2 yet despite excellent results abandoned classics in 1843 and spent two years at home too depressed even to read. He went on a walking tour in May 1844, and was reported drowned in the Danube at Vienna  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 17 Sept 1844). To his family's incredulous joy he returned in March 1846, having walked from Hungary, where for two years he had been slowly recovering. Lady Drysdale escaped Edinburgh gossip by going with George to Dublin, where in 1847&#150;9 he was well enough to study medicine at Trinity College; he then finished his undistinguished MD in Edinburgh (1855) and interrupted his studies for two years to write <span class="italic">Physical, Sexual, and Natural Religion</span> (1855), known after 1857 as <span class="italic">The Elements of Social Science</span>. It was accepted by the free thought publisher Edward Truelove.<br>
<br>Drysdale hid his personal motives for writing <span class="italic">Physical, Sexual, and Natural Religion</span> behind a confessional case history which paralleled his own story: early brilliance, adolescent sexual problems, a walking tour and staged drowning, and a return home to attempt life anew after two years of self-imposed exile. The patient recovered only after he had engaged in sex on the advice of Dr Fran&ccedil;ois Lallemand, whose theories about the necessity of intercourse  (<span class="italic">Des pertes s&eacute;minales involuntaires</span>, 3 vols., 1836&#150;42) Drysdale transmuted in his book into his law of exercise&#151;it was everyone's duty to engage in joyous sexual activity to preserve physical health and mental balance.<br>
<br>Drysdale was fired by Thomas Malthus's analysis of the balance between population and food with war, poverty, starvation, disease, and death as the regulators of over-population; he totally rejected Malthus's solution of sexual abstinence, choosing instead contraception. Without it single women withered as involuntary nuns; thoughtful men abstained from premarital sex and married late to avoid births; the irresponsible brought about over-population, poverty, prostitution, and venereal disease. Prostitutes deserved compassion, even respect, as martyrs to male sexuality. Drysdale believed that the churches had denatured women by prescribing a crippling model of excessive modesty and sexual shame. They had taken from women their female healers, and turned medicine over to the religious orders, whose successors were male. Women could not confide gynaecological problems to men; contemporary physicians were ill-informed, prudish, often incapable of examining them properly, and failed to give patients sexual or contraceptive information. <span class="italic">The Elements</span> described in plain language male and female sexual anatomy, physiology, and reproduction, the mental and physical results of abstinence, and all the known methods of contraception. Drysdale advocated women doctors, though his profession refused to countenance them. Despite a rather restricted middle-class outlook, he was a feminist when the women's movement had hardly started. Unusual in equating women's sexual nature with men's, he believed contraception would free both sexes to live naturally. He looked forward to a smaller population, where women, whose minds were as good as men's, would have an education as thorough as theirs, be their equally matched companions, and compete with them in all professions and trades. For years Drysdale lived with Letitia Gallafent, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Radley (<i>bap</i>. 1825), who was probably his partner.<br>
<br>Drysdale was led by his logic to revolutionary conclusions. Since contraception would permit early marriage, youthful errors would require new divorce legislation. With divorce effectively on demand, marriage would become meaningless. He found himself advocating permissive but publicly avowed relationships, a change of partners when relationships failed, and contracts to protect the children. His sexual permissiveness brought <span class="italic">The Elements</span> notoriety as &#145;the <span class="roman">Bible</span> of the brothel&#146;. <span class="italic">The Elements</span> sold 90,000 copies and was translated into eleven languages, including Hungarian. The cost of new stereotype plates made revision impossible. In 1878 and after Drysdale added appendices, including <span class="italic">The State Remedy for Poverty</span>, where he proposed fines for those who did not limit their families. He elaborated his views in his <span class="italic">Political Economist and Journal of Social Science</span> (1856&#150;7) and <span class="italic">Population Fallacies</span> (1860). As &#145;G.R.&#146; (George Rex, his school nickname) he wrote articles for Charles Bradlaugh's <span class="italic">National Reformer</span> during the 1860s. Later expanded as pamphlets, they discussed J. S. Mill, Irish home rule, and European federation. Bradlaugh (accused by his enemies of having written <span class="italic">The Elements</span>) did not know his contributor's identity; they communicated through Truelove. Known only as Charles's reclusive brother, George was never suspected of writing anything, though he did little else. George Drysdale, who died at 75 Palace Road, Penge, London on 19 November 1904, had begged Charles to fight on for <span class="italic">The State Remedy</span> and left him nearly &pound;18,000. He was buried in unconsecrated ground, without a memorial, at West Norwood, London.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_39446"></a><span class="headword">Charles Robert Drysdale</span>  (1828/9&#150;1907), <span class="occ">freethinker and birth control activist</span>, attended Edinburgh Academy from 1836 to 1842, but he was eclipsed at school by his elder brother, and began to shine only after George left. He began to read mathematics at Edinburgh University in 1843, but was probably with his brother in Vienna in May 1844. The shock of his idolized brother's supposed death made Charles a mediocre student until George's return. Charles read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge (1846&#150;7), then joined the family in Dublin and registered at the school of engineering (16 January 1848). As a pupil of his cousin, George Willoughby Hemans, he surveyed railways in Ireland and on the continent. His paper &#145;On steep gradients&#146; (8 April 1856) won the Telford medal (1856), yet he registered in medicine at University College, London (1855), obtaining a first-class MD at St Andrews (1859). He had seen poverty in Ireland, studied <span class="italic">The Elements</span>, and abandoned his career to become George's disciple and mouthpiece. George remained unknown: Charles, as a Malthusian propagandist, accepted scurrilous abuse as the supposed author of <span class="italic">The Elements</span>. Both poured their considerable fortunes into the cause. Charles claimed in his <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, appended to the posthumous thirty-fifth edition of 1905, that George retained his anonymity to protect his mother; the sensitivity of the material makes it as likely that he was protecting his privacy. Their choice of a profession meant secrecy if they were to implement George's conclusions. Charles and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39448/', "Dr Alice Vickery (1844&#150;1929)")</script> began their relationship when she was his student at the Ladies' Medical College in the 1870s; they never married and kept secret two children, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32908/', "Charles Vickery Drysdale (1874&#150;1961)")</script>. Charles put his property in their joint names; when Alice died it was worth about &pound;30,000. Both brothers guarded their domesticity at addresses which never reached the <span class="italic">Medical Directory</span>. George refused requests (made through Truelove) to debate his ideas. Charles and Alice, needing to work in their profession and maintain a platform presence as Malthusian propagandists, trumpeted George's theories while chafing at a secrecy which humiliatingly compromised their own integrity.<br>
<br>It was Charles who worked among the poor and in a Lock Hospital, specialized in women's diseases and syphilis, lectured on the need for female doctors, and instructed his patients and students on &#145;preventive intercourse&#146;. When the brothers realized that the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> (1864 and 1866) did not protect but rather penalized prostitutes, George changed a paragraph in <span class="italic">The State Remedy</span>, but Charles publicly joined those campaigning against the extension of the act. In 1877 &#145;G.R.&#146; wrote medical notes to Charles Knowlton's contraceptive manual, <span class="italic">The Fruits of Philosophy</span>, but after the trial of Bradlaugh and Annie Besant for publishing it, it was Charles who became president of their newly formed Malthusian League and editor of <span class="italic">The Malthusian</span>. After 1895 they all lived at 28 Carson Road, West Dulwich. At the Malthusian League's annual general meeting in 1907 Charles refused congratulations for his supposed success in lowering the birth-rate, attributing it all to George. A founder member in 1907 (with his son C. V. Drysdale) of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage, there was no time for him to contribute in any way. He edited his last <span class="italic">Malthusian</span> in November 1907, and died a fortnight later, on 2 December at Carson Road. Inscribed on his tomb in Brookwood cemetery is George's authorship of <span class="italic">The Elements</span>.<br>
