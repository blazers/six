</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy,  Thomas</span>  (1729&#150;1811), <span class="occ">writer and Church of Ireland bishop of Dromore</span>, was born on 13 April 1729 at The Cartway, Bridgnorth, Shropshire, the son of Arthur Lowe Percy (<i>d</i>. 1764), wholesale grocer and tobacconist, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nott. The surname appears as Pearcy in the baptismal register at St Leonard's Church, Bridgnorth; Percy himself wrote Piercy until 1756, when he definitively opted for Percy.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Percy was educated at Bridgnorth Free School (1737&#150;41) and Newport School, Shropshire (1741&#150;6). At the age of seventeen he went to Christ Church, Oxford, as a Careswell exhibitioner. His undergraduate studies were mainly classics, with some Hebrew. After taking his BA (1750) he continued with Hebrew as a part-time postgraduate, adding French and Italian. He obtained his MA in 1753.<br>
<br>Percy was ordained first as deacon (1751)&#151;in which capacity he preached in several churches in his home area&#151;and two years later as priest. Shortly after this Christ Church presented him with the living at Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire. He took up residence at Easton in 1756 and in the same year became rector of Wilby, some 6 miles away. He owed the latter appointment to the earl of Sussex, who also appointed Percy as his personal chaplain.<br>
<br>As a parson Percy was sincere, but perhaps somewhat worldly, with a liking for sightseeing, shooting, horse-racing, card games, plays, operas, coffee houses, and pleasure gardens. Nevertheless he was a keen and wide-ranging reader. In the early 1750s he began to write verse, some of which shows the possible influence of the ballads in a manuscript collection he had discovered. While visiting Humphrey Pitt at Shifnal, 11 miles from Bridgnorth, probably in 1753, Percy noticed a battered volume &#145;lying dirty on the floor, under a bureau in the parlour &hellip; being used by the maids to light the fire&#146;  (Hales and Furnivall, 1.lxiv). It proved to be a seventeenth-century collection, which he persuaded Pitt to reprieve from the flames. In due course it provided the basis for Percy's anthology, <span class="italic">The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span> (1765), and for his enduring fame.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandmaturity"></a>Marriage and maturity</h2>On 24 April 1758 Percy married Anne Gutteridge (<i>d</i>. 1806) of Desborough, Northamptonshire, who brought a dowry of &pound;2000. Between 1760 and 1772 their long-lasting union produced six children, of whom two died in infancy and two more, including their only son, Henry, predeceased them. Before these grievous losses, Percy in his sixteenth-century vicarage, with bees and fruit trees, wife and first child, pronounced himself (in 1760) the &#145;happiest of men&#146;  (Davis, 69).<br>
<br>Much though he relished the role of rural parson and patriarch, Percy looked to wider horizons. In 1765 he became chaplain and secretary to Lord Northumberland and tutor to his son, Algernon, in which capacities he often visited Northumberland House in London and also Alnwick Castle. His wife was signally honoured to be appointed (at a salary of &pound;200 a year) wet-nurse to Queen Charlotte's baby son, Edward (the future father of Queen Victoria); she spent eighteen months at Kew and Buckingham House (1767&#150;8), after which she received an annual pension of &pound;100 for life. Percy himself became in 1769 one of the king's chaplains-in-ordinary, a post which required him to preach from time to time before George III. He received DD degrees from Cambridge in 1770 and from his own university twenty-three years later.<br>
<br>Percy took the opportunity of visiting London to mix in literary and artistic circles, where he made many friends, including Edmund Burke, David Garrick, Oliver Goldsmith, Thomas Gray, David Hume, Samuel Johnson (who made a lengthy visit to Easton in 1764), Elizabeth Montagu, and Joshua Reynolds (who painted his portrait). The first such friend, William Shenstone, Percy met at The Leasowes, the latter's home near Halesowen, Shropshire. The ability to make and retain such friendships reflects well on Percy, who kept up a relentless round of meetings, backed by copious correspondence.<h2>
<a name="Publications"></a>Publications</h2>Percy's first published works were two sonnets printed in a periodical called the <span class="italic">Universal Visiter</span> (1756). A further poem of his, simply entitled &#145;Song&#146; and beginning &#145;O Nancy, wilt thou go with me?&#146; appeared in a collection of poems published by Robert Dodsley in 1758. This was later set to music by Joseph Baildon and famously described by Robert Burns (in 1792) as &#145;perhaps the most beautiful Ballad in the English language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Robert Burns</span>, ed. J. D. Ferguson, 1931, 2.126).<br>
<br>With the apparent gift of sensing a need for the new, while at the same time making use of his linguistic skills, Percy then turned away from his own light verses to translating the exotic, the primitive. He catered to the taste for chinoiserie by translating a Portuguese version of a Chinese novel, the argument of a play, some proverbs, and poems, under the title of <span class="italic">Hau Kiou Choaun, or, The Pleasing History</span> (4 vols., 1761), and by editing, the following year, two volumes of <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Pieces Relating to the Chinese</span>.<br>
<br>In 1763 Percy turned to the north, with <span class="italic">Five Pieces of Runic Poetry</span>, which he translated from the Icelandic with the acknowledged help of a clergyman neighbour, the Revd Edward Lye, a distinguished Anglo-Saxon scholar. Other translations were from Hebrew, French, Latin, and Spanish. His new version of the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span> appeared in 1764. <span class="italic">Northern Antiquities</span> (1770) consisted of Percy's translations both of Paul-Henri Mallet's <span class="italic">Introduction &agrave; l'histoire du Dannemarc</span> and of Goranson's Latin version of the <span class="italic">Prose Edda</span>. From the Spanish, Percy's <span class="italic">Ancient Songs Chiefly on Moorish Subjects</span> was ready for the press in 1775 but published only in 1932.<br>
<br>An original work, <span class="italic">A Key to the New Testament</span> (1766), quickly went through four editions. It shows, with <span class="italic">The Song of Solomon</span>, that Percy was not forgetting his clerical role. Nor did he neglect his patrons, the duke and duchess of Northumberland: in 1768 he published his edition of <span class="italic">The regulations and establishment of the household of Henry Algernon Percy, the fifth earl of Northumberland &hellip; begun anno domini MDXII</span>. It is possible that a similar motivation lay behind his ballad-style poem in 800 lines, <span class="italic">The Hermit of Warkworth</span>, begun in 1767 and published four years later. Despite such intense productivity, during the same eventful period Percy conceived, and in some cases started work on, a series of projects which either failed to come to fruition or did so at the hands of others: editions of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">Spectator</span>, and <span class="italic">Tatler</span>; of Buckingham's <span class="italic">Rehearsal</span> and Tottel's <span class="italic">Miscellany</span>; and of his own favourite book, <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>.<h2>
<a name="TheReliques"></a>The Reliques</h2>Another product of the hectic literary activity at Easton Maudit turned out to be Percy's most important and influential work, the three-volume anthology of which the full title is <span class="italic">Reliques of ancient English poetry: consisting of old heroic ballads, songs, and other pieces of our earlier poets. (Chiefly of the lyric kind). Together with some few of later date</span> (1765, published by Robert and James Dodsley). If indeed Percy rescued the original folio manuscript in 1753 it was probably consigned to a cupboard in the Pitt household for several years before he was able to beg it. His mind may have been brought back to it when Shenstone, whom he was visiting in the summer of 1757, read him a version of the ballad &#145;Gil Morrice&#146;. It was only in November of that year that he wrote to Shenstone that he had &#145;a very curious old MS. Collection of ancient Ballads&#146; which Johnson had seen and urged him to publish  (<span class="italic">Percy Letters</span>, 7.1&#150;3).<br>
<br>Johnson, despite being somewhat contemptuous of ballads and prone to teasing Percy with parodies of them, had offered to help select and annotate the material, though he did not do so. The task fell to Shenstone, who greatly influenced both Percy's selection of ballads and his editorial policy. Until Shenstone's death in 1763 the two men engaged in sustained correspondence on ballad topics with frequent exchanges of ballad texts. In addition Percy travelled at least twice to Halesowen, taking with him the precious folio. At an early stage he decided not to publish the manuscript in its entirety but to supplement it from other sources. In the end only a quarter of the printed work came from the folio, though the original contents influenced Percy's selection of material: historical ballads, Robin Hood ballads, metrical romances, traditional items, and modern ballad imitations.<br>
<br>To request possible material and to discuss it Percy wrote to academics such as Thomas Warton of Oxford and Richard Farmer of Cambridge, antiquarians such as the Scots lawyers John McGowan and David Dalrymple (later Lord Hailes), and ballad scholars or collectors such as Evan Evans and David Herd. He went carefully through published anthologies of ballads and consulted unpublished collections held by such bodies as the Society of Antiquaries or preserved in libraries. He went to Magdalene College, Cambridge, to see the Pepys collection, and with the help of amanuenses took copies of a large number of black-letter broadsides. He contacted a contemporary printer, Cluer Dicey, who supplied him with over eighty street ballads issued by his father, William (characterized by Percy as &#145;the greatest printer of Ballads in the Kingdom&#146;; <span class="italic">Percy Letters</span>, 7.109).<br>
<br>The ballad trade was, to say the least, not held in high esteem, and Percy &#145;could never quite satisfy himself that ballad editing was a suitable employment for a conscientious clergyman&#146;  (Davis, 104). Yet he persevered, commenting in 1761:<blockquote>I am content to perform the office of scavenger for the public, and as Virgil found <i>Gold</i> among the <i>Dung</i> of <i>Ennius</i>, from all this learned Lumber I hope to extract something that shall please the most delicate and correct Taste. (S. H. Harlowe, &#145;Letters from Dr Percy to T. Astle, esq.&#146;, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 4 ser., 3, 1869, 25&#150;7)</blockquote>To this end, Percy excluded bawdy, as well as almost all politics and protest. He saw himself including &#145;effusions of Nature&#146;  (Hales and Furnivall, 1.1), deriving from the unspoilt childhood of literature and the nation, yet he was happy to collate, patch, and rewrite whenever he deemed it necessary. He planned to dedicate the book to the memory of Shenstone but at a late stage offered the dedication to Elizabeth Percy, countess (later duchess) of Northumberland. When she accepted, Johnson, swallowing his dislike of patrons, agreed to Percy's request that he write a (suitably grovelling) dedication. Percy then went through the whole text again to ensure that the countess's sensibilities could not possibly be offended, excising and bowdlerizing as he did so. In addition the planned volume 3 was brought forward to be volume 1 so as to give prominence to ballads on the Northumberland Percys.<br>
<br>When the book came out, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> reviewer commented that Percy &#145;has with great judgement selected such specimens [of ballads] as either shew the gradation of our language, exhibit the progress of popular opinion, display the peculiar manners and customs of former ages, or throw light on our early classical poets&#146;, and expressed the view that the work &#145;well deserves the encouragement of the public&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 35, 1765, 179, 183). The public duly responded. Within five months 1100 sets of the three elegant volumes (out of 1500 printed) had sold, at half a guinea a time. Percy's editorial policy seemed to be vindicated, with some of the most doctored ballads securing the highest approval.<br>
<br>One critic, at least, remained unconvinced, the eccentric and choleric Joseph Ritson, who suggested that the &#145;learned collector has preferred his ingenuity to his fidelity&#146; and alleged that the folio manuscript did not exist at all  (J. Ritson, ed., <span class="italic">Ancient Songs and Ballads</span>, 1792, xix&#150;xxi). He kept up the criticism for many years, accusing Percy of printing scarcely &#145;a single poem &hellip; fairly or honestly&#146; and of practising &#145;every kind of forgery and imposture&#146;  (Ritson, <span class="italic">Romance&euml;s</span>, 1802, cix, cxliii n.). A cartoon of 1803 by James Sayer shows Ritson trampling underfoot &#145;Dr Percy's ancient ballads&#146;, while penning from an inkpot marked &#145;Gall&#146; a statement including &#145;Dr Percy a Liar Warton an infamous Liar a pipe&euml;r better than a parson&#146;  (BM satire 10171).<br>
<br>Ritson's criticisms, seen to be broadly justified in 1867&#150;8 when the folio manuscript was published, have been largely endorsed by later scholars. But Percy did at least take ballads seriously, annotating them with great care. He treated them as literary phenomena, largely ignoring their music and their links with oral tradition, but a scholar in the late twentieth century made this assessment: &#145;Percy's work was brilliant and blundering, inspiring both the interest and standards which were later to condemn it. It was, however, a noble experiment and one as remarkable for its failures as for its triumphs&#146;  (Knapman, 213).<br>
<br>Most of Percy's contemporaries welcomed the <span class="italic">Reliques</span> as a powerful blast of fresh air. &#145;Poetry has been absolutely redeemed by it&#146;, wrote Wordsworth  (&#145;Essay supplementary to the preface&#146;, <span class="italic">Lyrical Ballads</span>, 1815, 3, 75). Several generations of poets felt its influence: Blake, Coleridge, Keats, Rossetti, Morris, Swinburne, and many lesser lights. Scott, both as novelist and ballad-editor, owed a debt to the book, as did figures such as B&uuml;rger, Herder, and the Grimm brothers in Germany, and by extension European Romanticism in general.<h2>
<a name="Lateyears"></a>Late years</h2>After the early 1770s Percy wrote little, perhaps burnt out after a prolonged period of frenetic activity. There were verses on the death of Johnson (1785) and a memoir of Goldsmith (1801), together with editions of the works of Buckingham (2 vols., 1806?) and of Surrey and Wyatt (with George Steevens, 2 vols., 1807). A second edition of the <span class="italic">Reliques</span> appeared in 1767 and a third in 1775. When a fourth was called for Percy published it (1794) under the ostensible editorship of his nephew and namesake since he felt that the book was not consistent with his position as bishop.<br>
<br>Percy was appointed dean of Carlisle in 1778, thanks to the patronage of Northumberland. He did not sever his links with Northamptonshire until 1782, when he became bishop of Dromore in northern Ireland. He immersed himself in his pastoral duties in this small town some 60 miles west of Belfast, to the exclusion of much else. After forty-eight years of marriage his wife, Anne, died in December 1806 and was buried in her husband's cathedral. By this time Percy was losing his sight. He died at the bishop's residence, Dromore, more or less blind, on 30 September 1811 at the age of eighty-two, and was buried next to his wife. Several people in northern Ireland were moved to send valedictory poems to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, where an obituarist wrote that Percy:<blockquote>constantly resided [at Dromore], promoting the instruction and comfort of the poor with unremitting attention, and superintending the sacred and civil interests of the diocese, with vigilance and assiduity; revered and loved for his piety, liberality, benevolence, and hospitality, by persons of every rank and religious denomination. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 81, 1811, 483)</blockquote>Reprints of some of Percy's books continued through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. His <span class="italic">Key to the New Testament</span> was republished as late as 1842, <span class="italic">Northern Antiquities</span> in 1882, <span class="italic">The Hermit of Warkworth</span> in 1883, <span class="italic">Regulations and Establishment</span> in 1905, and <span class="italic">Life of Goldsmith</span> in 1976. These were far outstripped by the <span class="italic">Reliques</span>, of which well over a score of reprints or adaptations appeared in the nineteenth century alone. The <span class="roman">Everyman</span> edition of 1906 had at least five printings, and as late as 1996 a facsimile of the first edition of the <span class="italic">Reliques</span> came out.<br>
<br>Nine volumes of Percy's correspondence were published between 1944 and 1988. Percy material, published and otherwise, is widely scattered through private collections in Britain and America, New Zealand, and South Africa. The famous folio is in the British Library. Percy's work continues to attract the attention of scholars around the world. Percy not only travelled from grocer's warehouse to bishop's palace but in a parallel literary career produced at least one book, the <span class="italic">Reliques</span>, long recognized as &#145;a seminal work of English Romanticism&#146;  (Groom, 1.1) and considered a landmark in European literature.<br>
