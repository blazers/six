<span class="headword">Richardson,  Reginald John</span>  (1807/8&#150;1861), <span class="occ">political reformer</span>, was born in the Manchester area. Nothing is known of his parents or formative years except that, aged eleven, he witnessed the Peterloo massacre. In 1822 he became an apprentice to a carpenter and joiner, a trade he followed until a workplace injury in the 1830s forced him to give it up. Married about 1833, he and his wife, Elizabeth, opened a newsagency in Chapel Street, Salford. Alongside the newsagency, he also worked as a newspaper editor, lecturer, and pamphleteer.<br>
<br>Richardson's first public activity was in 1826, when he spoke at meetings in support of striking power-loom weavers; he later achieved national notoriety by moving an amendment for universal suffrage at a public meeting held in Manchester during the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> crisis in 1832. By January 1838 he was secretary of both the South Lancashire Anti-Poor Law Association and the Manchester Trades Council. In September 1838 he was elected as a Manchester delegate to the Chartists' first national gathering, the General Convention of the Industrious Classes. His speech on the constitutional right to bear arms was reprinted as a pamphlet. By mid-1839 he was at odds with the Manchester Chartists on questions of policy and in July he resigned as a delegate. In particular he opposed the inclusion of a &#145;national holiday&#146;, or general strike, in the proposed &#145;ulterior measures&#146; to be enacted should the House of Commons reject the national petition in favour of the Charter. He was nevertheless arrested in September 1839 and indicted along with Bronterre O'Brien and others for sedition and conspiracy. In April 1840, after a trial at Liverpool in which he conducted his own defence, he was convicted and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.<br>
<br>Richardson served his sentence in Lancaster Castle, where he drew up a plan for a national Chartist body. This was published during the debate leading up to the formation of the National Charter Association in July 1840. He also wrote a pamphlet entitled the <span class="italic">Rights of Women</span> which made the case for widows and unmarried women to be given the vote, as well as a series of lengthy essays on the condition of handloom weavers. A prison inspector who interviewed him reported that his &#145;temper is so low that he began to quarrel with the other Chartists as soon as he arrived&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 20/10), a pattern that was repeated throughout his stormy public career. While he was undoubtedly an obstreperous individual, his truculence was indicative of fierce independence.<br>
<br>On his release in December 1840 Richardson declared his unshaken commitment to radicalism in the tradition of Major Cartwright and Henry Hunt. In April 1841 <span class="italic">The Times</span> published a letter from him in support of the candidature of the paper's proprietor, John Walter, who was standing as a tory at a by-election at Nottingham. Richardson praised Walter's opposition to the new poor law and to centralized government, and hailed him as a defender of the ancient rights and privileges of the people. In June 1841 Richardson was himself nominated as parliamentary candidate for the borough of Perth, but he failed even to secure victory at the show of hands over the sitting whig MP, Fox Maule. His relations with the mainstream Manchester Chartists again soured and, pleading heavy debts, he left Salford in October 1841 to become editor of the <span class="italic">Dundee Chronicle</span>, a post he held for six months. In April 1842 he further distanced himself from the Chartist majority in south-east Lancashire by his advocacy of an alliance with middle-class radicals and attendance at the complete suffrage conference in Birmingham. He returned to Salford where he established a &#145;tract library&#146;; he also began writing for Bronterre O'Brien's <span class="italic">British Statesman</span>. Although he often clashed with leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League, he remained a staunch advocate of repeal and in 1843 he published an analysis of the parliamentary support for the corn laws, suggesting that the intransigence of the &#145;monopolist majority&#146; strengthened the case for parliamentary reform.<br>
<br>Although he remained active in Chartism after 1842&#150;3, Richardson's attention shifted primarily to local affairs. He was elected to the Salford police commission in October 1839 and re-elected in 1842. He was also involved in other local government institutions, including the select vestry, and was a churchwarden. In 1844 he took a leading part in the campaign for public parks that resulted in the creation of Peel Park in Salford, although his attempts to have working men represented on the steering committee were unsuccessful. In June 1854, in his evidence to the select committee on public houses chaired by C. P. Villiers, he attributed the improvement in the sobriety of Manchester's city population over the preceding decade to the movement to establish public parks and institutions such as refreshment rooms, libraries, and museums which provided healthy forms of leisure.<br>
<br>For a time Richardson had owned a beer house, but by 1854 he was a land and buildings surveyor, carrying out valuations of house property in Salford. After 1848 he participated in a succession of attempts to establish a joint working- and middle-class reform movement but ill health prevented him from being very active. Nevertheless, his claim to have been involved &#145;in every movement that has taken place amongst the working classes since I can remember&#146;  (&#145;Select committee on the regulation of public houses&#146;, 196) was not an exaggeration. He died at Newton Heath, near Manchester, on 23 January 1861, survived by a widow, Fanny (probably his second wife), and three young children as well as several older children.<br>
