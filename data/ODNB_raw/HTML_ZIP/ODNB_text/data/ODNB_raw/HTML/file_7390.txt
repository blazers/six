<span class="headword">Deane, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1792&#150;1871), <span class="occ">builder and architect</span>, was born on 4 June 1792 in Cork, the eldest of the eight surviving children of Alexander Deane (1759/60&#150;1806), builder, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1828), daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth Sharpe, also of Cork. The Deanes, who had come originally from Scotland, had been involved in the building trade in Cork for several generations. After his father's death in 1806, aged forty-six, his mother took over the business and Deane, who was reputedly self-educated, joined her while still in his teens. In 1809 he married Catherine Connellan, with whom he had two children, John Connellan (1815&#150;1887), assistant secretary to the Dublin Exhibition of 1853 and secretary to the Manchester art treasures exhibition of 1857, and Julia (<i>d</i>. 1863).<br>
<br>In 1811 Deane designed the Cork Commercial Buildings in South Mall, won in competition against William Wilkins of London. This had a competent, if unexciting, palace fa&ccedil;ade in the Regency style. He arranged the education of his siblings, training his brothers Alexander (1796&#150;1847) and Kearns (1804&#150;1847) as architects and sending them to London to study under the drawing master Alfred Nicholson. Kearns, who was particularly talented, designed the Dominican church of St Mary, Pope's Quay, Cork (1832&#150;9). He probably also played a major role in the design of Dromore Castle, near Kenmare, co. Kerry, built by the Deane company in 1831&#150;8. He was jointly responsible for a number of designs with Thomas, including Horsehead, Passage West (1836&#150;7), and Frankfield Chapel, Cork (1838), both in the Gothic style, and the neo-classical Cork Savings Bank on Warren Place (1839&#150;42). The latter superseded Thomas's earlier savings bank on Pembroke Street (1824). Thomas also designed his own residence, Dundanion Castle (1832), the Bank of Ireland in Cork (1838&#150;40; dem.), and the Limerick Savings Bank (1839; executed by W. H. Owen, engineer).<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, Deane married, on 13 January 1827, Elizabeth (Eliza) O'Callaghan Newenham (<i>d</i>. 1851), with whom he had three children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7391/', "Sir Thomas Newenham Deane (1828&#150;1899)")</script>, who was to join the practice, Susanna, and Olivia. In 1830 he was knighted by the lord lieutenant during his second term in office as high sheriff of Cork. He represented tory merchant interests on the corporation, which seems to have effectively excluded him from architectural practice in the surrounding whig-controlled county. Much of this business went instead to the brothers James and George Richard Pain, to whom the Deanes lost the commission (which they had won in competition) for the city and county court house in Cork (built 1830&#150;35). While Deane's public persona was ebullient (one contemporary described him as a &#145;ceaseless chatterbox&#146;), he was watchful of professional and political rivals and was ever ready to seize his opportunity. He was also prone to self-doubt, seeking reassurance from friends for his actions.<br>
<br>In addition to his business and political interests, Deane was one of the founders, in 1816, of the Cork Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts. His prot&eacute;g&eacute;s included the sculptors John Hogan and Edward Ambrose, and the painter Samuel Forde. Deane's collections included geological specimens, carved marbles from Baalbek and Palmyra, and James Cavanah Murphy's survey drawings of the great Gothic monastery at Batalha in Portugal.<br>
<br>In December 1845 the board of works commissioned Deane to design the new Queen's College, Cork. Firm designs were not, however, prepared until after the board had agreed the following April to purchase a site at Gill Abbey, recommended by Deane for its &#145;excellent and commanding&#146; situation. Kearns Deane, who was in declining health and died in January 1847, may have had some involvement with the design, which was in the Perpendicular Gothic style. However, much of the credit was due to Deane's new assistant Benjamin Woodward (1816&#150;1861), who joined the practice some time in the first half of 1846.<br>
<br>In April 1847 Deane was awarded a further board of works commission, a new district lunatic asylum at Killarney. The elevations, in the Early English style and much influenced by A. W. N. Pugin, were probably Woodward's, but the planning, which owes much to the writings of Dr John Conolly of Hanwell, was probably largely dictated by the board. The building was opened at the end of 1852.<br>
<br>After the death of his second wife, from breast cancer, in June 1851, Deane fell victim for a time to recurring bouts of depression. The practice was reconstituted with Deane, his son Thomas Newenham Deane (who had graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1849), and Woodward as partners. In the earliest known design of the partnership, an unplaced entry in the Belgic&#150;Gothic style for the Cork town hall competition of 1851, can be seen the origins of their best-known building, the University Museum at Oxford (1854&#150;60). Deane was one of the instigators of the Irish National Exhibition, Cork's answer to the Crystal Palace, which opened in June 1852: his portrait by James Butler Brenan, which was displayed at the exhibition, is now in the collection of the Royal Hibernian Academy. A slightly later lithographic portrait is in the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. Deane was somewhat stocky in appearance, with striking features and a receding hairline.<br>
<br>In August 1852 Deane and Woodward were invited to submit a design for the new museum building at Trinity College, Dublin, in a limited competition. Following the submission of the working drawings in October 1853, Deane made arrangements to take over the lease of a house on Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, which would serve as both an office and a residence for his son (now married with two children). Deane remarried on 16 November 1853 (in Manchester) and effectively went into semi-retirement, remaining in Cork until 1860. He and his third wife, Harriet Williams (<i>c</i>.1814&#150;1881), had one child, Hermann Frederick (1858&#150;1921), later an ordained minister and librarian and chapter clerk of St George's Chapel, Windsor.<br>
<br>While the partnership of Deane and Woodward continued until Woodward's death from tuberculosis in May 1861, there is little evidence that Sir Thomas played any significant role in the design of the buildings that made them famous: the Trinity Museum building (1853&#150;7); the University Museum at Oxford; the Oxford Union (1856&#150;7), decorated by the Pre-Raphaelites; the Kildare Street Club in Dublin (1858&#150;61); and the highly placed competition entry for the government offices in Whitehall (1857). At the Trinity Museum, where they were tied to the plans of the college architect, John McCurdy, the Ruskin-inspired elevations in the Venetian cinquecento style and the use of naturalistic carving can be ascribed to Woodward. The minutes and archives of the University Museum, Oxford, indicate that while Deane attended some early meetings, Woodward was in charge of both the design and execution. When questioned on the matter in 1855, Ruskin wrote: &#145;Mr. Woodward is, as far as I am concerned, the acting man &hellip; I see Woodward and tell him what I want and if [Sir Thomas] Deane does it I am much obliged to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Ruskin</span>, 16.xlvi). The main contract was substantially complete by the time Woodward's declining health forced him to spend periods abroad. While Thomas Newenham Deane played an increasing role in running the practice from this time, Woodward managed to continue designing, and can be credited with the bulk of the smaller commissions also, such as houses and schools. Sir Thomas Deane's connections remained useful in securing work and his friendship with the Acland family seems to have been a factor in their entering (and winning) the University Museum competition at Oxford.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas assisted in the revival of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in 1863: he was elected president in 1868 but offered his resignation at the end of the year on account of advanced age and ill health. In 1860 he was one of the first architects to be admitted to membership of the Royal Hibernian Academy under a new charter and served as its president in 1866&#150;8. He died in his house, 26 Longford Terrace, Monkstown, co. Dublin, on 2 October 1871, at the age of seventy-nine, leaving an estate of almost &pound;14,000, large by Irish standards. He was buried in St Michael's churchyard, Blackrock, co. Cork. Thomas Newenham Deane continued to run the practice up until his death in 1899, having been joined by his own son Thomas Manly Deane in 1878; both were knighted for their services to the profession.<br>
