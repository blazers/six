<span class="headword">Ramsey,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1595&#150;1644), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born of unknown parents. He apparently passed his adult musical career at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was organist and master of the choristers, and from where he supplicated for the MusB degree, having spent seven years in the study of music. A grace was granted on 10 June 1616 on condition that he compose and perform a motet in the university church of St Mary the Great: this work, the eight-part <span class="italic">Inclina domine</span>, is still extant. His acceptance of these duties may in fact have antedated the award of his degree, and it was probably in a musical capacity that he justified his first recorded payment by the college in 1616 when, styled simply Mr Ramsey, he was allowed 20<i>s</i>. &#145;for extra commons at the tyme of the Kinges being here&#146;  (Payne, <span class="italic">Provision and Practice</span>, 283). This suggests a much earlier date of appointment than has been accepted by most commentators and almost certainly refers to royal visits that had taken place in Easter term of the previous year. An additional commons payment followed in 1619 but, owing to lacunae in the archives, no further payments to him appear until June 1629.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1622 Ramsey married Elizabeth Ryding at Great St Mary's, Cambridge, and the couple moved to the parish of Holy Trinity, where, between 1623 and 1626, three children were born to them. Ramsey is styled master of the choristers in January 1632, though at Trinity these duties and those of organist were discharged by one man. Further &#145;rewards&#146; followed in the 1630s and early 1640s, possibly for the composition of music. These include payments of 10<i>s</i>. made in July 1638 by Peterhouse, very probably for music delivered to that college for inclusion in its so-called &#145;Caroline&#146; partbooks, and of 5<i>s</i>. &#145;for one werke&#146;  (Payne, <span class="italic">Provision and Practice</span>, 284) unfortunately not specified.<br>
<br>Ramsey's music, though variable in quality, is important for its experimental, Italianate features typical of the early baroque. His most adventurous music is contained in his continuo songs and monodies, such as &#145;What Tears, Dear Prince&#146;, which laments the death in 1612 of Henry, prince of Wales, and the highly expressive &#145;In Guilty Night&#146;. Such settings cater to the taste for Italianate music which Thomas Mace says was prevalent in Cambridge at the time, and the composer's royalist sympathies would have been much appreciated at Trinity. Ramsey mourned Prince Henry's death with another work&#151;the &#145;Dialogues of Sorrow&#146;, dated 1615 in its manuscript source and probably meant for publication. This work uses a consort of viols and was probably intended, together with a number of English madrigals, for domestic use at Trinity and, like the majority of them, is both scored in six parts and fragmentary.<br>
<br>Ramsey is perhaps best-known for his settings of English and Latin liturgical texts, which, while embracing Italian practice, are generally more conservative than his solo vocal pieces in the new monodic style. His Latin music employs devices found, for example, in Monteverdi's sacred music; but he is at his best when combining the madrigal and anthem, as in his masterpiece, the six-part &#145;How are the mighty fallen&#146;. Some of his madrigals and anthems, including a fine six-part elegy, probably on the death of Prince Henry, entitled &#145;Sleep fleshly birth&#146;, are preserved in a set of autograph partbooks (Euing Collection, Glasgow University Library).<br>
<br>Ramsey died in 1644 and was buried at Holy Trinity, Cambridge, on 12 February; at Michaelmas of the same year the college paid 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. towards his funeral expenses. &#145;Widdow Ramsey&#146;, very probably the composer's widow, was buried on 2 August 1667  (Payne, <span class="italic">Provision and Practice</span>, 284&#150;5).<br>
