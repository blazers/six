<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ferguson,  John</span>  (1838&#150;1916), <span class="occ">chemist and bibliographer</span>, was born on 24 January 1838 at Alloa in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, the second of three children of William Ferguson and his wife, Margaret Kidd. His father moved from Alloa at an early date, settling in Glasgow as a merchant. Ferguson was educated at the old high school of Glasgow, at that time situated between John Street and Montrose Street, and subsequently matriculated at the University of Glasgow for the session 1855&#150;6. In total he spent nine years as a matriculated student, most of these in the faculty of arts, graduating BA in 1861 and MA with honours in 1862. As an undergraduate he distinguished himself, winning several prize essay competitions, with titles as diverse as &#145;Historical account of the papacy as a temporal power in Europe&#146; and &#145;On cohesion&#146;. However, rather than proceeding to Oxford or Cambridge, the typical course for brilliant arts faculty students to follow, he remained in Glasgow to develop his increasing interest in science, which had begun in the late 1850s.<br>
<br>At that time Professor William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) was engaged on his research into electric telegraph cables and Ferguson was employed by him, both in the laboratory and on field trips, to carry out numerous electrometric experiments. In addition to experimental work Ferguson was also required to prepare an abstract of some of Thomson's lectures for the use of students. This resulted in the publication of <span class="italic">Elements of Dynamics</span>, part 1 (1863), and the first occurrence of his name in print. In 1863 he matriculated in the faculty of medicine in order to pursue studies in chemistry. After a time working as a student in the chemistry laboratory he became assistant to the professor, Thomas Anderson, and in 1868 was appointed university assistant with responsibility for tutorial classes and the supervision of students in the laboratory. By 1869 ill health forced Anderson to hand over general responsibility for running the chemistry department to Ferguson, who became intimately involved in planning its transfer to the new university site at Gilmorehill to the west of the city centre. Following Anderson's death in 1874 Ferguson was appointed to the regius professorship. By all accounts Ferguson was an excellent teacher, to which the number of his students subsequently occupying chairs of chemistry, both in Britain and throughout the empire, bears eloquent testimony. However, by 1867, with the publication of a paper on Geber in <span class="italic">The Laboratory</span>, discussing the identity of this writer with the Arabic author Jabir, Ferguson had already established the historical and bibliographical character of almost all his subsequent output. It was this bias towards the more developmental and philosophical aspects of his subject that was to cause some contemporaries to criticize the absence of experimentation from his work. But as John Millar Thomson, his assistant and subsequently professor of chemistry at King's College, London, remarked, &#145;from the record of the work done by those who came immediately under his influence, it is clear that he encouraged experimental research in others&#146;  (Thomson, 8).<br>
<br>Ferguson lamented the lack of interest shown in the history of science in Britain and determined to use his position to redress this imbalance to some small degree. After he settled into his new position as professor, a steady stream of papers and articles flowed from his pen. Many of these were published in the proceedings of the several learned societies of which he was a member, for example: &#145;On the study of the history of chemistry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow</span>, 1875, 27&#150;39), an attempt to periodize the history of chemistry; &#145;Recent enquiries into the early history of chemistry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow</span>, 1876, 368&#150;89), dealing largely with Greek manuscript sources from the second to the fifth centuries AD; an article on Sir Humphrey Davy for <span class="italic">Good Words</span> (1879); and five entries for the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1879&#150;88) on Geber, Christopher Glaser, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Paracelsus, and Karl Wilhelm Scheele. Between 1882 and 1915 he published a series, <span class="roman">Bibliographical Notes on Histories of Inventions and Books of Secrets</span>, based on talks delivered to the Archaeological Society of Glasgow. In these he focused on the early writers of compendia (Albertus Magnus, Vincent de Beauvais, Polydore Vergil, Roger Bacon, and Conrad Gesner) and books of technical recipes.<br>
<br>Also, from the mid-1870s until its eventual publication in 1906, Ferguson was working on what has become his most enduring monument, the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca chemica</span>. According to the subtitle this purports to be &#145;A catalogue of the alchemical, chemical and pharmaceutical books in the collection of the late James Young of Kelly and Durris&#146; , but in fact was transformed by Ferguson into a detailed biobibliography of alchemical and early chemical writers which has yet to be superseded. By establishing and defining the corpus, the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca chemica</span> has become the primary reference work for anyone commencing research in the area. Carl Gustav Jung, for example, referred to it frequently in his books on psychology and alchemy. Although only describing 1300 books (a fraction of what Ferguson was to possess himself) it runs to over a thousand pages in two quarto volumes due to the wealth of bibliographical and biographical information provided for each entry.<br>
<br>Another subject which was to engage Ferguson over several years was the elusive figure of Paracelsus. His first essay in Paracelsian research was a paper delivered to the Glasgow University Dialectic Society in 1873 simply entitled &#145;Paracelsus&#146;. This was followed by a series of six <span class="roman">Bibliographia Paracelsica</span>, issued privately between 1877 and 1896, and in 1894 he acquired the extensive collection of Paracelsica belonging to Dr Eduard Schubert. In 1897 Ferguson published <span class="italic">Bibliographical Notes on the Witchcraft Literature of Scotland</span>, revealing yet another interest, one which, by his own testimony, &#145;But for the chance acquisition of one or two rare books, I should never have entered on&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Aspects of Bibliography</span>, 1900, 38).<br>
<br>Ferguson's personal library was extensive, containing in the region of 18,000 volumes. While it had been his intention to bequeath his collection intact to a public institution, his will could not be found after his death. Consequently the contents of his estate, books, jewellery, silver, and wines were sold at auctions in Glasgow and London in order to satisfy the claims of inheritors. Fortunately the principal part of his library (some 11,000 volumes) dealing with alchemy, early chemistry, metallurgy, mineralogy, the Rosicrucians, Paracelsus, witchcraft, and the Romani language, was preserved from dispersal when the University of Glasgow purchased it in 1921.<br>
<br>In addition to his scientific pursuits, Ferguson enjoyed music. He was a competent instrumentalist and attended concerts frequently. Thomson in his memoir reports that whenever the violinist Joseph Joachim was playing in Glasgow he would come to visit Ferguson. Ferguson also liked to travel and was often abroad representing the university in an official capacity. He was well liked and possessed a keen if somewhat caustic sense of humour, a fact which may account for his nickname &#145;Soda&#146;. He was energetic to the end of his life and loved hillwalking in the western highlands. Ferguson was president of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow (1892&#150;5) and of the Glasgow Archaeological Society (1891&#150;4), and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Society of Antiquaries, the Chemical Society, and the Institute of Chemistry in London. He was also an honorary member of the Imperial Military Academy of Petrograd. He died of heart disease on 3 November 1916, at 6 Claremont Terrace, Glasgow, and was buried five days later at the family burying-ground at Alloa.<br>
