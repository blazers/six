<span class="headword">Lambert,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1813), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, younger son of Captain Robert Lambert (<i>d</i>. 1810), entered the navy in 1795 on the <i>Cumberland</i> in the Mediterranean, and in her was present in the action off Toulon on 13 July 1795, when the <i>Alcide</i> struck to the <i>Cumberland</i>. He afterwards served in the <i>Virginie</i> and <i>Suffolk</i> on the East India station, and having passed his examination on 15 April 1801 was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Suffolk</i>, from which he was moved in October to the <i>Victorious</i>, and in October 1802 to the <i>Centurion</i>. Continuing on the East India station, he was promoted commander of the <i>Wilhelmina</i> on 24 March 1803, and captain of the <i>San Fiorenzo</i> on 9 December 1804. In February 1805 he distinguished himself by the capture of the French frigate <i>Psyche</i>, commanded by Captain Bergeret; he was confirmed in his rank on 10 April 1805.<br>
<br>In June of the following year Lambert returned to England. In May 1808 he was appointed to the <i>Iphigenia</i>, which he took first to Quebec and afterwards to India. In 1810 the <i>Iphigenia</i> was employed in the blockade of Mauritius; she was also one of the squadron under Captain Samuel Pym in the disastrous attack on the French squadron in Grand Port beginning on 22 August, which resulted in the loss or destruction of three of the four frigates. On the afternoon of 27 August the fourth frigate, the <i>Iphigenia</i>, with the men of two of the others on board, and with little or no ammunition remaining, was attempting to warp out of the bay, against a contrary wind, when three other French frigates appeared off the entrance. Disabled, unarmed, and crowded with men, the <i>Iphigenia</i> could not resist. Lambert surrendered, on an agreement that he, the officers, and crew should be sent on parole to the Cape of Good Hope or to England within a month. In the event the prisoners were detained in Mauritius, and were released only when the island was captured by the British on 3 December, and the <i>Iphigenia</i>, then in French service, was recovered. Lambert was then tried by court martial for the loss of his ship, and was honourably acquitted.<br>
<br>In August 1812 Lambert commissioned the frigate <i>Java</i> (38 guns), formerly the French <i>Renomm&eacute;e</i>, captured off Tamatave on 21 May 1811. On the voyage to the East Indies she fell in with the United States frigate <i>Constitution</i>, off the coast of Brazil, on 29 December 1812. Lambert could have avoided action, but he chose the bolder course, hoping to damage the <i>Constitution</i> enough to cause her commander, Commodore Bainbridge, to abandon his cruise. Poorly manned and heavily laden with stores, the <i>Java</i> was at a considerable disadvantage during the engagement. After about an hour Lambert was fatally wounded by a musket-shot in the breast; the defence continued until the <i>Java</i>, close to sinking, was forced to haul down her colours. On the second day she was cleared out and set on fire. On 3 January 1813 the <i>Constitution</i> anchored at San Salvador, where the prisoners were landed, and where, on 4 January, Lambert died; he was buried on the following day.<br>
