<span class="headword">Athelwold</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1156/7), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was probably born in Yorkshire, the son of unknown English parents. Nothing is known of his early life, but at some point he attracted the attention of Henry I, whose confessor he became. The lands in the Yorkshire soke of Pocklington which he came to hold were presumably given to him by this king. By 1122, moreover, he had become prior of the Augustinian house of Nostell, recently founded by Henry I to replace a community of hermits and the recipient of a papal bull of confirmation in 1120. Athelwold built the crypt of the new monastic church, and under his direction Nostell flourished, supported by local magnates, Thurstan, archbishop of York, and Henry I. Indeed he remained active in court circles, and the election of William de Corbeil to be archbishop of Canterbury in 1123 is said to have been partly due to Athelwold's advice. In 1131 he was one of the English churchmen who represented Henry I at the papal council held at Rheims. But he was also at work in the north of England. Not only was he prior of Nostell, but it was also the unanimous tradition at Carlisle that upon the foundation of the Augustinian priory there in 1122 or 1123, Athelwold was its first prior. Such a promotion might seem improbable, but given the likelihood that the foundation of Carlisle Priory was from the first intended to lead to the creation of a bishopric in English Cumbria, it may be that his priorate was intended to be only a temporary office, and lasted longer because the establishment of the new see was delayed for a decade. It is certain, however, that as prior of Nostell Athelwold was involved in the foundation of houses of Augustinian canons in Scotland, a programme supported by Alexander I and David I. Scone was a daughter house of Nostell, and the first prior of St Andrews after its refoundation as a house of Augustinian canons had been a Nostell canon under Athelwold, who was present at his consecration at York in 1127.<br>
<br>In 1133 a new diocese of Carlisle was created, and Athelwold was appointed its bishop, being consecrated on 6 August. Since one of the purposes of the new see was to exclude the claims of the bishop of Glasgow in a region taken under English rule only in 1092, it may have been hoped that Athelwold's Scottish connections would make the creation of his diocese, which was bound to appear provocative north of the recently created border, acceptable to David I. But only two years later David annexed the northern counties of England. Whether Athelwold had been active as bishop between 1133 and 1135 is impossible to say. He certainly continued to attend Henry I, but a letter of Osbert of Clare, praising the industry of this new light on the church's candlestick, could be construed as showing that Athelwold had also been busy in his diocese. But following David I's seizure of that diocese, he seems to have stayed at Stephen's court, accompanying Stephen to Normandy in 1137, and several times attesting his charters. However, in 1138, following the battle of the Standard, the papal legate, Alberic, secured Athelwold's return to Carlisle and his reconciliation with King David. The bishop did not finally sever links with Stephen until 1143, but was increasingly likely to be found in his diocese, and at the Scottish court, witnessing charters for David I, and for David's son and grandson, at Edinburgh and Bamburgh, as well as at Carlisle. He secured for Nostell a grant of 40<i>s</i>. yearly from the Scottish king's revenues at Bedford, and when those were lost, had it replaced by an equivalent grant from the Carlisle silver mines.<br>
<br>In Cumbria Athelwold attended to the organization of his diocese. The archdeaconry which served it was his creation. Charters for Wetheral Priory refer to synodal and archidiaconal dues, and express concern that vicars be properly maintained. An attempt to affiliate Carlisle Priory to the austere observance of the Augustinian abbey of Arrouaise seems to have failed, but local tradition ascribed to Athelwold the foundation of the hospital of St Nicholas outside Carlisle, and he may well have also founded the city's grammar school. In a wider ecclesiastical context he supported William de Ste Barbe against the attempts of William Cumin to intrude himself into the see of Durham between 1141 and 1144, and later showed his sympathies with the cause of ecclesiastical reform by aligning himself with Henry Murdac against William Fitzherbert in their struggle for the archbishopric of York. Athelwold was numbered among Murdac's supporters in 1147, and when Murdac was driven from York in the following year, Athelwold received him with appropriate respect at Carlisle. But although Murdac's cause owed much of its strength to the fervour of the Cistercians, Athelwold clearly continued to show favour to traditional Benedictine monasticism, confirming grants to Whitby, Wetheral, and St Mary's of York.<br>
<br>By the early 1150s Athelwold's health and strength were probably beginning to fail. A prior of Carlisle appears for the first time in 1150, indicating that if Athelwold had indeed held that office, he was now relinquishing it. A significant proportion of his income must have come from the revenues of Carlisle Priory, since the bishopric had never been adequately endowed. But now he confirmed the cathedral canons in their own possessions. In 1153 he resigned as prior of Nostell, pleading bodily weakness (though it is also possible that he was anxious to avoid having anything to do with William Fitzherbert, by then reinstated as archbishop of York). He was able to attend the coronation of Henry II in Westminster Abbey on 19 December 1154, and he subscribed a charter of the new king's at York in the following year, but he died on either 25 May 1156 or (more probably) 10 May 1157. Athelwold was later believed to have been buried at Carlisle Priory. The diocese of which he was the first bishop was by that time so firmly established that after his death it was able to survive an episcopal vacancy of nearly fifty years.<br>
