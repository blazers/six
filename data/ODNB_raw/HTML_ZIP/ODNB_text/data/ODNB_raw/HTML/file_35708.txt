<span class="headword">Reed,  Edward Tennyson</span>  (1860&#150;1933), <span class="occ">cartoonist and caricaturist</span>, was born on 27 March 1860, at Greenwich, London, the only son of the naval architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35707/', "Sir Edward James Reed (1830&#150;1906)")</script> and his wife, Rosetta, eldest daughter of Nathaniel Barnaby of Sheerness, Kent, and sister of the naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby. He was educated at Harrow School and at the age of twenty had visited Egypt, China, and Japan. As a young man he spent time at the House of Commons sketching politicians in action. In March 1890 he became a permanent member of the staff of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, having been recommended by his friend and fellow cartoonist Linley Sambourne. He had very little early training as a draughtsman, but he conceived the idea of applying a burlesque of prehistoric life to contemporary events and persons and called the series <span class="roman">Prehistoric Peeps</span>. Thus <span class="italic">A Quiet Game of Whist in Early Times</span> demonstrates the inconvenience caused to card-playing cave dwellers by the presence of the stegosaurus, the triceratops, and the pterodactyl. The drawings, which were executed in a spirit of broad and riotous comedy, became fashionable, and no doubt the fact that the Natural History Museum at South Kensington had not been open long enough for the skeletons of ancient monsters to lose the charm of novelty, greatly added to their appeal. It is certain that scientific lecturers bore witness at the time to their probable verisimilitude, and that schools applied for the use of Reed's pictures as instructional magic-lantern-slides. For many years he used palaeontology, archaeology, and heraldry as the basis of his humour.<br>
<br>In 1891 Reed married Beatrice, daughter of William Bullen of Earlsfield; they had a son and a daughter. He succeeded Harry Furniss in 1894 as the illustrator of <span class="italic">Punch</span>'s parliamentary pages under the title <span class="roman">Essence of Parliament</span>, a post which he held for eighteen years. His style was similar to that of his rival Sir Francis Carruthers Gould in the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>. He captured the likenesses of politicians with the soft shading of a pencil. He was a popular after-dinner speaker and lecturer, and his cartoons were purchased by politicians. George V visited his exhibition at the Dudley Gallery in Piccadilly and purchased two cartoons. Many of his drawings were published in collections, notably <span class="italic">Mr. Punch's Prehistoric Peeps</span> (1896), <span class="italic">Mr. Punch's Animal Land</span> (1898), <span class="italic">Mr. Punch's Book of Arms</span> (1899), and <span class="italic">The Tablets of Azit-Tigleth-Miphansi the Scribe</span> (1900), the last-named (as the portentous paronomasia implies) being a mock-historical record of current politics illustrated in the Assyrian monumental manner.<br>
<br>Reed left the staff of <span class="italic">Punch</span> in 1912 and subsequently drew for <span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, the <span class="italic">Passing Show</span>, the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday Evening Telegraph</span>, and the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>. He died in London on 12 July 1933 after a long illness.<br>
