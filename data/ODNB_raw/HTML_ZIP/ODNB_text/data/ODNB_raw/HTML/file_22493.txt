<span class="headword">Ponsonby, Sir  Frederic Cavendish</span>  (1783&#150;1837), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 6 July 1783, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63967/', "Frederick Ponsonby, third earl of Bessborough (1758&#150;1844)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38506/', "Henrietta Frances Ponsonby (1761&#150;1821)")</script>, second daughter of the first Earl Spencer. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15911/', "Lady Caroline Lamb")</script> was his sister. He attended Harrow School and then entered the army in January 1800 as a cornet in the 10th light dragoons, becoming lieutenant on 20 June of that year, and captain on 20 August 1803. In April 1806 he exchanged to the 60th regiment, and served on the staff of the lord lieutenant in Ireland. He became major in the army on 25 June 1807, and on 6 August obtained a majority in the 23rd light dragoons. He went with them to Spain in 1809, and distinguished himself at Talavera.<br>
<br>Ponsonby served on the staff as assistant adjutant-general at Busaco and Barossa. Graham, in his report of the latter action, said that a squadron of the 2nd hussars, King's German Legion, under Ponsonby's direction, made &#145;a brilliant and most successful charge against a squadron of French dragoons, which were entirely routed&#146;  (Gurwood, 4.697). He had become lieutenant-colonel on 15 March 1810, and on 11 June 1811 obtained the command of the 12th light dragoons, and led that regiment for the rest of the war. He played a principal part in the cavalry action near Llerena on 11 April 1812, when he was in temporary command of Anson's brigade, to which his regiment belonged. The French cavalry under Pierre Soult was about 2000 strong, while Ponsonby had about 600, as one regiment of the brigade was still in the rear. He was told by Sir Stapleton Cotton to detain and distract the French while Le Marchant's brigade moved round upon their flank. The French, seeing his lack of numbers, advanced, and he retired slowly before them into a narrow defile between some stone walls. They were on the point of charging when his missing regiment came up, and the head of Le Marchant's brigade appeared on the right. The French turned, and were pursued by the two brigades to Llerena, where they rallied with their infantry, having lost more than 150 men. Ponsonby was praised by Cotton for his gallantry and judgement.<br>
<br>Ponsonby was actively engaged with his regiment in covering the movements of the army immediately before Salamanca, and in the battle itself on 22 July 1812, towards the evening, he made some charges and dispersed some of the shaken French infantry, his horse receiving several bayonet wounds. After the failure of the siege of Burgos he helped to cover the retreat of the army, and was wounded. At Vitoria his regiment formed part of the force under Sir Thomas Graham which turned the French right, and barred their retreat by the Bayonne Road. Engaged in the action at Tolosa, when Graham overtook Foy, the regiment covered the communications of Graham's corps during the siege of San Sebastian. Ponsonby took part in the subsequent operations in the Pyrenees and in the south of France, and brought to Wellington, after Toulouse, the news that Napoleon had abdicated. He returned to England in July 1814, and on 4 June of that year was made a brevet colonel and aide-de-camp to the king in recognition of his services. Ponsonby's frequent letters on his experiences in the Peninsula are printed in <span class="italic">Lady Bessborough and her Family Circle</span>, edited by Lord Bessborough and A. Aspinall (1940).<br>
<br>In 1815 the 12th light dragoons, with Ponsonby still in command, formed part of Vandeleur's light cavalry brigade. At Waterloo this brigade was at first posted on the extreme left; at about half past one, when the two heavy brigades charged, it was moved towards the centre, and two regiments, the 12th and 16th light dragoons, were ordered to charge, to cover the retirement of the Union brigade. They were told to descend the slope, but not to pass the hollow ground in front; once launched, however, they were not easily stopped or rallied. Ponsonby himself, after receiving wounds in the lung and both arms, fell from his horse on the crest of the ridge occupied by the French guns. He later admitted they had advanced too far. He lay on the field all night and was plundered by soldiers but, contrary to all expectations, he recovered, nursed by his sister Caroline.<br>
<br>Ponsonby left his regiment on 26 August 1820, exchanging to half pay, and on 20 January 1824 he was appointed inspecting field officer in the Ionian Islands. He married, on 16 March 1825, Lady Emily Charlotte Bathurst (<i>d</i>. 1 Feb 1877), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1696/', "Henry Bathurst, the third Earl Bathurst")</script>, and left three sons and three daughters. His eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22497/', "Henry Frederick Ponsonby")</script>.<br>
<br>Ponsonby became major-general on 27 May 1825, commanding the troops in the Ionian Islands, and on 22 December of the following year he was made governor of Malta, where he remained until May 1835 and where a column, later destroyed, was erected in his honour. On 4 December 1835 he was given the colonelcy of the 86th regiment, from which he was transferred to the 1st (Royal) Dragoons on 31 March 1836. In 1831 he was made a KCB and a KCH; he was also a GCMG (1828), and had Portuguese and Austrian orders. He kept up his interest in cavalry issues, on which Wellington consulted him, for the duke was quite a close friend, which proved of value to his son, Henry. When in Spain he had made an abridgement of <span class="italic">Instructions for Cavalry on Outpost Duty</span>, drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel von Arentschildt, who commanded the hussar regiment which was to have charged with the 23rd at Talavera; this abridgement was printed at Freneda in 1813 and reprinted, together with the original instructions, in London in 1844.<br>
<br>Ponsonby was a brave soldier, but impetuous. He was in youth a gambler, but cured himself of the habit. He died suddenly at the Wellesley Arms, Murrell Green, near Basingstoke, on 11 January 1837.<br>
