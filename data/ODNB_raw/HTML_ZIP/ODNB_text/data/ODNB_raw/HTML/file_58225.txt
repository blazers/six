<span class="headword">Cromek,  Thomas Hartley</span>  (1809&#150;1873), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 64 Newman Street, London, in late July 1809, the only son of the engraver and book illustrator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6752/', "Robert Hartley Cromek (1770&#150;1812)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hartley (1779&#150;1848). Following his father's death in London, his mother took him to live with his grandfather at Bridge House, Wakefield; he attended the Moravian school at Fulneck, near Leeds, from 1820 and Wakefield grammar school from 1821. His early interest in drawing was greatly encouraged by James Hunter, a local portrait painter, and Joseph Rhodes of Leeds who accompanied him on sketching tours. In 1827 Thomas Teale, a Leeds surgeon, commissioned Cromek to make some detailed anatomical drawings, for each of which he was paid 5<i>s</i>.: Cromek observed later that &#145;to the very minute attention which these drawings required I attribute careful and accurate drawings&#146; which became his &#145;principal merit as an artist&#146;  (Cromek, &#145;Reminiscences&#146;, fol. 5).<br>
<br>For the sake of his mother's health Cromek set out in June 1830 for Florence and Rome, armed with letters of introduction from the duchess of Leeds. Before leaving he met John Constable who lectured him about &#145;young men going to Italy to study&#146;, supposing that &#145;England was not large enough for an artist now a days&#146;  (Cromek, &#145;Reminiscences&#146;, fol. 13). After a short stay in Florence he quickly moved on to Rome and there met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37277/', "Edward Cheney")</script> and later Henry Cheney: these two brothers figured among Cromek's most important patrons, giving him many introductions and becoming his lifelong friends. In the spring of 1831 he sketched fragments in the Vatican Museum and in the forum and the ruins of the colosseum, Caesar's palace, and the Farnese Gardens, subjects which proved to be significant and regular sources for his commissions. He visited the Roman campagna and many towns and villages such as Frascati, Assisi, Tivoli, and Ariccia, and was shown the excavations at Pompeii by the archaeologist Sir William Gell. By the winter of 1832 he was admitted to a private Russian sketching society which concentrated on sketching figures in costume; the influence of this group can be seen in many of his watercolours. While in Rome he also met many British artists, including the sculptors John Gibson, M. C. Wyatt, and Joseph Gott, and the painters Joseph Severn, Penry Williams, and Thomas Uwins. In 1834 Cromek journeyed to Greece; he had intended to go to Palestine but upon reaching Syria he was forced back by the plague then raging in the Levant and returned to Greece. He spent time in Mycenae and Argos, and then stayed for two months in Corfu before returning to Venice to join Edward Cheney for a sketching tour. Arguably this journey to Greece prompted some of his finest drawings, many of which were sketched <i>en plein air</i>; they reveal a freshness of colour and an originality of method somewhat lacking in his later, more finished, drawings.<br>
<br>Cromek returned to England in 1835 and in January 1836 was received into the Roman Catholic church. Soon afterwards, in July 1836, he married Anastasia Priestman; they had three daughters. In September 1836 he made another visit to Florence, where, in the following year, he continued to sketch all the prominent views and buildings of the city. Cromek's memorialist, James Fowler, recorded that by now his reputation was fully established, and that he gave lessons to Edward Lear at about this time. On 5 July 1837 he was invited to the Palazzo Pitti to present his work to the grand duke and duchess of Tuscany; they selected seven views of Greece. He wrote: &#145;In consequence of this patronage I am much talked about and I expect it will lead to an increase in my connections and commissions&#146;  (Cromek, &#145;Reminiscences&#146;, fol. 41). These expectations were indeed fulfilled, as his career flourished between 1840 and 1849: in both Florence and Rome he received a constant flow of commissions and gave lessons to many of the distinguished visitors then flocking to Italy. By 1845 he was able to undertake a second visit to Greece. As Fowler proclaimed, &#145;these were prosperous days&#146;, and Cromek &#145;moved in the most intellectual society in Rome&#146;. Back in London in the summer of 1843 he was summoned to Buckingham Palace to show his drawings to the queen and Prince Albert. Victoria bought two drawings: when the artist Peter DeWint heard of this he jealously remarked that &#145;the Queen has no taste&#146;. Appalled, Cromek wrote that he &#145;was so disgusted with de Wint's illiberality and apparent friendship that I never saw him more&#146;  (Cromek, &#145;Reminiscences&#146;, fol. 96).<br>
<br>The outbreak of the civil war in Italy in 1849 compelled all English residents to leave Rome, and thus Cromek returned to England. In 1850 he exhibited four major drawings at the Royal Academy and he was elected an associate of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours. Despite sympathy and help from many of his friends, especially Clarkson Stanfield, he never maintained in England the level of success he had achieved in Rome. By 1861 his health had so deteriorated that he had lost the use of his hands and no paintings are recorded after this date. He died in Hatfield Street, Wakefield, Yorkshire, somewhat impoverished, on 10 April 1873.<br>
