<span class="headword">Munro, Sir  Hugh Thomas, of Lindertis</span>, fourth baronet  (1856&#150;1919), <span class="occ">mountaineer and landowner</span>, was born on 16 October 1856 at 27 Eaton Place, London, the eldest of the nine children of Sir Campbell Munro of Lindertis, third baronet (1823&#150;1913), and his wife, Henrietta Maria (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of John Drummond. Munro enjoyed a privileged childhood at the family residence in London and at their Scottish country estate near Kirriemuir, Forfarshire. The climbing career for which he gained posthumous fame began at the age of seventeen when, having travelled to Stuttgart to learn German, he first holidayed in the Alps. This trip also marked the beginning of a lifetime punctuated by foreign travel and interwoven with the martial and diplomatic networks of the British empire. As a young man Munro's training for a career in business was placed on hold after he found in military service a more obvious means to satisfy this wanderlust. Having spent several years abroad serving as an aide-de-camp, he travelled to the Cape of Good Hope in 1880. While this trip was initially restorative following an attack of pleurisy, an opportunist streak helped him secure a post as private secretary to Sir George Pomeroy Pomeroy-Colley, the governor of Natal. With the outbreak of hostilities in the Basuto War, Munro volunteered for active service and was given a posting as a courier in Landrey's Horse, an irregular cavalry corps. Much later in life his appointment as a king's messenger of foreign dispatches would revive these field skills, although in the rather more luxurious circumstances which international diplomacy afforded.<br>
<br>Following his return to Britain from southern Africa, Munro's attention turned north to the ancestral seat in Forfarshire. First as estate manager and heir apparent, then, following his father's death in 1913, as laird and fourth baronet, Lindertis was the focus for family life and a base for local activism on behalf of the Conservative Party. A member of the central council of the Conservative Party in Scotland, he stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for Kirkaldy district of burghs at the general election of 1885, but was subsequently elected a member of Forfarshire county council. He married Selina Dorothea, the daughter of Major-General Thomas Edmond Byrne, on 29 August 1892; the couple had a son and three daughters before the premature death of Selina in May 1902. Although he had a predictable enthusiasm for field sports and highland dress, family memories also reveal a less conventional dimension to Munro's establishment image. An idiosyncratic vein of natural mysticism was evidenced by a belief in the supernatural, his abilities as a water diviner, and the existence of heavenly music. That he had experienced the last of these atmospheric phenomena in the Scottish mountains is entirely appropriate. It was here, scaling the heights, that Munro was in his element.<br>
<br>Permanently bearded, compact, and wiry of stature, Munro was renowned among the membership of the Scottish Mountaineering Club for powers of endurance and resourcefulness, and for his redoubtable character on even the most demanding expeditions. Despite this muscular image, combined with a pair of feet small and nimble enough to secure his reputation as a skilled highland dancer, Munro was no mountain gymnast. He would happily skirt precipitous rock faces in favour of the simplest route leading to any mountain peak. Such an approach aligned him with the &#145;salvationist&#146; tendency of the Scottish Mountaineering Club, as opposed to the rope-bound &#145;ultramontane&#146; with whom they enjoyed a jocular, very masculine rivalry. A near permanent fixture at early outings and social gatherings, Munro's &#145;clubbable&#146; nature led to his election as honorary president in 1894. He was equally comfortable walking alone. Equipped with compass, aneroid barometer, maps, thermometer, and measuring poles, he navigated his way across entire hill ranges, covering prodigious daily distances. The many published accounts of these arduous solo expeditions are functional and factual in character rather than effusive. However, they do attest to an enduring fascination with topographical survey techniques, and an obvious frustration with the still flawed 1-inch maps being produced by the Ordnance Survey. Thus his progress on any route was punctuated by regular stops to take aneroid readings, measure distances between prominent landscape features, fix summit heights, and scribble detailed notes on visible montane panoramas. It is tempting to see this enthusiasm for recorded fact and classificatory order as an extension of a boyhood yen for natural history, indulged in collections of butterflies, birds' eggs, shells, and fossils.<br>
<br>While measuring Scotland's &#145;mountains&#146; was at first Munro's private passion, this pedestrian odyssey was to be afforded official sanction by the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1889. His commission, to assemble an accurate list of all summits rising to heights of 3000 feet or above, clearly reflected the club's constitutional objective of furthering scientific study in the mountains. The completion of the project consumed Munro for three years. With a tenacity verging on fanaticism he even undertook some of the necessary field expeditions under cover of darkness in winter conditions. These clandestine operations were deemed the most effective means to respect the claims to privacy made by fellow sporting landowners. The results of these labours originally appeared in the club's journal of 1891. &#145;Munro's tables&#146;, as they would soon become known, listed some 283 mountains by name, height, grid reference number, and according to seventeen geographical areas. This did not mark an end to his efforts. Munro remained committed to the continual revision and refinement of the tables for the remainder of his life. Indeed, when he succumbed to pneumonia on 19 March 1919 at the Red Cross canteen which he had helped establish in Tarascon, southern France, a second edition of his treasured tables was very close to completion.<br>
<br>Steeped in the traditions of Victorian field science and imperial exploration, Hugh Munro's schema for mountain classification has since become a key influence on the popular understanding and experience of Scotland's geography. Thousands of &#145;Munro-baggers&#146; devote their weekends to collecting the country's summits, with the long-term objective of &#145;compleating&#146;. Ironically Munro, having failed to climb three peaks, was not the first to accomplish this feat. For active &#145;Munroists&#146;, and those now confined to the armchair, this discovery is emblematic of a contested and intriguing legacy. Munro's specific criteria for the award of mountain status were far from transparent. Although he relied heavily on repeatable scientific practice, this was combined with value judgements on the relative merits of different landscapes. Thus while certain shapely peaks were considered deserving of inclusion in the tables, less distinctive points of the required height were assigned the more lowly status of a &#145;top&#146;. Although revised metric maps produced by the Ordnance Survey, depicting the 3000 feet contour with greater accuracy, have led to the discovery and deletion of Munros, other amendments have been made by the Scottish Mountaineering Club on less obviously objective grounds. That ultimate sanction for these decisions still lies with just one organization means that the whole question of promotion to, and deletion from, the tables remains highly contentious among the climbing community. The debates show few signs of subsiding.<br>
<br>Munro was buried near Lindertis on 2 April 1919. From his graveside several &#145;mountains&#146; are in view.<br>
