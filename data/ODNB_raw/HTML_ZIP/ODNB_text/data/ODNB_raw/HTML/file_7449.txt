<span class="headword">Delaune,  Gideon</span>  (1564/5&#150;1659), <span class="occ">apothecary</span>, was born in N&icirc;mes, France, the eldest of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7452/', "William Delaune (c.1530&#150;1611)")</script>, physician and Reformed protestant minister, and Katherine des Loges (<i>d</i>. 1607). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7450/', "Paul Delaune")</script> was a younger brother. The family moved to England in 1572&#150;3, to escape the persecution of Huguenots in France, and settled in the Blackfriars precinct in London some time about 1575. Although it is not known where he received his medical training, by 1590 Delaune was established as an apothecary in Blackfriars and was married to another French immigrant, Judith Chamberlen. This marriage and his sister Sarah's subsequent marriage to Judith's cousin, Pierre Chamberlen, tightly connected Delaune to this other prominent Huguenot refugee medical family, whose members were principally known for their contributions to obstetrics. Judith died in 1631, and Delaune remained a widower for eighteen years before he married Jane Johnson on 31 May 1649. Jane was still living at the time of his death in 1659.<br>
<br>Some time between 1606 and 1610 Delaune was appointed apothecary for Anne of Denmark, James I's queen. Together with the king's physician, Th&eacute;odore Turquet de Mayerne, another Huguenot refugee, Delaune pressed for the formation of a separate guild or society for apothecaries, who at that time were subsumed within the Grocers' Company. In 1610 he was the foremost advocate of a parliamentary bill that would have distinguished apothecaries from grocers. That bill failed, but in December 1617 James I did grant a charter incorporating apothecaries into a separate society, placing them, however, under the ultimate supervision of the College of Physicians. Delaune, one of the original members of the new society named in the charter, immediately took an active and prominent part in the life of the new body. He headed the first court of assistants of the society, and in 1618 oversaw the revision of the <span class="italic">Pharmacoepia Londoniensis</span>, which set out the proper ingredients of the goods which members of the society could make and sell. After the City of London made him a freeman in 1623, Delaune served as under-warden of the society in 1624&#150;5, upper-warden in 1627, and master in 1628&#150;9 and again in 1636&#150;7. In 1632 he provided the property for the building of Apothecaries' Hall in Blackfriars, the area of London where he resided throughout his life in England. An entry in the court minutes of the society in 1648 acknowledged Delaune as &#145;a principal means for the procuring of the said company to be made a corporation and for the purchasing of the capital messuage now belonging to the said company called Apothecaries' Hall&#146;.<br>
<br>Delaune was also one of the foremost members of the Huguenot immigrant community in the capital, which gathered together in the autonomous French church in Threadneedle Street, London. The minister of this church, Nathaniel Marie, was his brother-in-law, while Delaune's own brother Pierre was minister to the Huguenot congregation in Norwich. Delaune himself served as a deacon of the London church from 1593 to 1596, and as elder from at least 1614 and throughout the 1620s. In 1621 he served on its delegations, which called on the archbishop of Canterbury and the privy council to argue for the preservation of the church's distinct Calvinist ecclesiastical discipline.<br>
<br>Delaune's alien birth at times impeded his participation in the political and economic life of London. In January 1626 he had to step down from the office of alderman of Dowgate Ward, to which he had been elected, because he was a &#145;stranger&#146;. Although he only became a &#145;denizen&#146; of the realm in April 1635, Delaune largely overcame the disabilities connected with his alien birth and was able to enter the circles of the native English &eacute;lite. In 1613 the College of Arms awarded him and his brothers a coat &#145;of the arms of the family of Delaune of Belmesnil in Normandy, from which they were descended&#146;. He owned the manor of Sharsted in Kent, an estate at Roxted in Bedfordshire, shares of land in Virginia and Bermuda, and a mansion and ten tenements in Blackfriars, London. The two children from the twelve born to him who grew to adulthood both married into the English gentry. His daughter, Anne Delaune, married Sir Richard Sprignell, baronet, of Coppenthorpe, Yorkshire; his son, Abraham Delaune, married Anne Sandys, the daughter of Sir Edwin Sandys of Northbourne Court, Kent.<br>
<br>A kinsman, Thomas Delaune, claims with a good deal of hyperbole in his <span class="italic">The Present State of London</span> (1681) that Delaune was worth &pound;90,000 at the time of his death at Blackfriars in 1659  (p. 330). Much of this great wealth probably came from the sales of &#145;Delaune's pill&#146;, which Thomas Delaune claimed &#145;is in great request to this day, notwithstanding the swarms of pretenders to pill-making&#146;  (ibid.). Gideon Delaune's will and a funeral certificate from the College of Arms both claim that he was aged ninety-four years at his death. He left &pound;1000 for his burial and was buried on 3 March 1659 in the churchyard of St Anne Blackfriars; the funeral was conducted by the College of Arms and followed the ceremony usually reserved for an alderman of London.<br>
