<span class="headword">Foster,  George</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1650), <span class="occ">millenarian and religious writer</span>, is virtually invisible in contemporary records. Nearly everything known about him comes from two tracts of 1650. In <span class="italic">The Sounding of the Last Trumpet</span>, which was circulating in April Foster recorded a series of visions he had experienced in the first two months of the year, beginning on 14 January, and which he claimed had been commanded by God to be printed. In these visions God had prophesied to Foster that unequal wealth would end; that after its recent tyrannical treatment of the Levellers parliament and its forces would be overthrown by an army led by Lord Fairfax, whom Foster unsuccessfully attempted to meet on 15 January in order to deliver his prophecy; and that a period of equality in wealth and power would follow. In November, Foster published a reset but otherwise unaltered version of this tract together with <span class="italic">The Pouring Forth of the Seventh and Last Viall</span>, which combined the message of social levelling with a philosemitic one (Foster now signed himself Jacob Israel). The saints and converted Jews, he predicted, would in 1651 gather in Italy where they would proceed to defeat and by 1654 kill the pope, and by 1656 kill the sultan of Turkey. This would clear the way for the founding of Sion in Jerusalem, first as a large temple resembling St Paul's Cathedral, then as a purely spiritual construction: the community of the saints. However, between April and November Fairfax had resigned his command as commander-in-chief of the parliamentary army and retired to Yorkshire; the leader of Foster's apocalyptic crusade would be an unspecified Englishman.<br>
<br>Foster's visions were of God revealing a fiery apocalypse to come, in which all inequality of wealth would disappear and some people would be destroyed. The very rich and very poor would respectively find their lot eroded or raised up to the level of the godly middling sort; charity would abound; and all forms of selfish behaviour would cease. Foster stated that the New Model Army was to be accepted as the instrument of God, its occupying presence in London being a way of silencing all opposition to millenarian politics. The language of these works is impeccably both prophetic and experiential. It inhabits and refashions the writings of several <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophets (notably <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> and <span class="roman">Daniel</span>), and the epistle of <span class="roman">James</span>, and is painstaking in its detailed account of elaborate vision sequences, and the physical fits, shakings, and tremblings that accompanied them. These would sometimes last some seven hours, and some had, in Foster's mind, musical accompaniments. Characteristically, God was experienced by Foster as an interpreter of the visions, and occasionally angels visited with divine messages. There is evidently some connection, at least in <span class="italic">The Sounding of the Last Trumpet</span>, with the writings of the ranters Abiezer Coppe and Laurence Clarkson, and possibly also of Digger Gerrard Winstanley, since Foster appears to repeat some of their key phrases. This suggests that Foster may have been part of the ranter circles, though in the absence of further evidence it may be that Foster simply read ranter tracts. His interest in the joining of Jews and Christians resembles in outline the vision of the prophet Thomas Tany.<br>
<br>Foster had a distinctive vision of the final &#145;revolution of all things&#146;, as he put it: a construction by God of new, non-fleshly bodies for the souls of everyone. He understood man to be an angel driven into a fleshly form at the fall, and the recovery of Eden to involve a vegetarian (indeed, vegan) paradise of subsistence on fruit, with animals brought into the universal freedom enjoyed by humans. In the fallen world, Foster claimed, the spirits of dead, wicked men possessed witches and noisy animals such as dogs and hens. This was the state of hell, which would last for the wicked until the general restitution. Finally, in the redeemed world, only one language would be spoken.<br>
<br>Charges for Cromwell's entertainment on 6 June 1652 from, among others, Israel Jacob, may locate Foster in Canterbury among aldermen and city officials, in more elevated company than he is usually supposed to have kept.<br>
