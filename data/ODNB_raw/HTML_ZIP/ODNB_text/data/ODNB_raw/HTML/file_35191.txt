<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nehru, Jawaharlal</span>  (1889&#150;1964), <span class="occ">prime minister of India</span>, was born in Allahabad on 14 November 1889, the eldest child of the lawyer and politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35192/', "Motilal Nehru (1861&#150;1931)")</script>, and of his second wife, Swarup Rani. He had two younger sisters, the elder of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47741/', "Vijayalakshmi Pandit (1900&#150;1990)")</script>. Nehru was doted on by his parents and brought up in luxury.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandearlycareer"></a>Education, marriage, and early career</h2>From his mother Nehru learned Hindu legend and folklore, while a Muslim retainer told him stories of the uprising of 1857. But his father wanted for him the best that British education could offer and in 1905 took him to England and had him admitted to Harrow School. Joe Nehru, as he was known, was a good pupil but not specially distinguished in any way. After two years he moved to Trinity College, Cambridge, where again he made no mark. In 1910 he obtained a second class in part one of the natural sciences tripos and joined the Inner Temple. On being called to the bar in 1912 he returned to India and for the next four years led an aimless life in Allahabad. He accompanied his father to the high court but had no interest in a legal career. In politics, too, he had no deep involvement.<br>
<br>Nehru married in Delhi on 8 February 1916 a bride selected by his father. Kamala (<i>c</i>.1899&#150;1936), daughter of Jawaharmal Kaul, the owner of a flour mill in Delhi, was a Kashmiri Brahman, as was Nehru&#151;hence the caste honorific pandit (Brahman), which was often used but which he disliked. Ten years younger than her husband, Kamala lacked a Western education and in the Nehru household felt bitterly conscious of her inadequacies. In November 1917 a daughter, Indira [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31136/', "Gandhi, Indira")</script>], was born. Kamala's health was poor, and by 1920 she showed incipient signs of tuberculosis.<br>
<br>In June 1914 Nehru was drawn into active politics by Annie Besant. His first public speech was to protest against the demand that Mrs Besant give pecuniary security for good behaviour under the <span class="roman">Press Act</span>. He withdrew his application to join the Indian Defence Force, constituted on the lines of the Territorial Army, and became one of the secretaries of the Home Rule League in Allahabad. He also helped to run <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, the newspaper started by his father in 1918 to express the viewpoint of the Indian National Congress.<h2>
<a name="Nationalistleader"></a>Nationalist leader</h2>In 1919, when Mahatma Gandhi launched his campaign of civil disobedience, Nehru at last found a cause meriting his full dedication. Gandhi seemed to offer effective leadership in contrast to other Indian politicians. The response of British public opinion to the shooting of an unarmed crowd in Amritsar in April 1919 cast doubt on British goals for India, and the worth of the proposed constitutional reforms. Nehru accepted without reserve Gandhi's moral preoccupations and, though he later moved away from many of them, the deep personal bond between him and Gandhi remained unbroken until Gandhi's death in 1948.<br>
<br>In 1920 Nehru by chance found himself involved in peasant unrest in the United Provinces, his home province. He encouraged the peasants to organize themselves and formulate their demands. He was impressed by their stoicism, though he was not as yet fully aware of their economic wretchedness. In December 1921 he was arrested for unlawful activity and, though sentenced to prison for six months, was released after three months on technical grounds. Baffled by Gandhi's having called off civil disobedience in February 1922, after a mob had caused the deaths of several constables by setting fire to a police station, he yet remained a loyal campaigner and organized spinning, boycott, and picketing in his province. In May 1922 he was back in prison, this time for eight months. Released in January 1923 through a general amnesty in the province, he found the Congress divided, with his father the leader of a group wishing to return to electoral politics and Gandhi opposed to this strategy. His inclinations were with Gandhi and, torn by the conflict of loyalties, he supported the compromise which permitted members to contest the elections to the legislative council without leaving the party. Drawn against his will into municipal politics, he won widespread respect during his two years as chairman of the Allahabad municipal board from April 1923. In December 1923 he was appointed a general secretary of the Congress.<br>
<br>Kamala lost an infant son in 1924 and her health was deteriorating. So in March 1926 Nehru accompanied her to Europe with their daughter to seek medical treatment, and settled in Geneva. Kamala's health showed little improvement, but Nehru took advantage of his stay to read widely and to make contact with left-wing movements in Europe. In February 1927 he attended, as the representative of the Indian National Congress, the International Congress against Colonial Oppression and Imperialism in Brussels. He now gave emphasis to the economic side of imperialism, developed contacts with nationalists in China and Latin America, and gained an international perspective. Joined by his father, in November 1927 he visited the Soviet Union, where he was impressed especially by what he saw of rural reconstruction and the fight against illiteracy.<br>
<br>In November 1927 Nehru returned to India with pronounced radical views and, at the December session of the Congress, forced through a resolution proclaiming independence rather than dominion status as India's objective. He also formed the Independence for India League as a pressure group within the Congress to work for political freedom and economic change. But both the resolution and the League amounted to little. Nehru was more effective in organizing a boycott of the statutory (Simon) commission appointed (without any Indian members) by the British government to consider the working of the 1919 constitutional reforms. At Lucknow in November 1928 Nehru, participating in a procession protesting against the arrival of the commission, was beaten up by the police. He also found time during this year, while wandering around the country, to try to educate his daughter by writing to her about the early history of humanity. These letters were published in 1929 as <span class="italic">Letters from a Father to his Daughter</span>.<br>
<br>In November 1929 Nehru presided over the annual session of the All-India Trade Union Congress at Nagpur and the next month at Lahore over the annual session of the Congress, which was now, after a year's notice, committed to independence and civil disobedience. In his presidential address he asserted that he was a republican and a socialist, and would like the Congress to commit itself to ending the domination of any class; but he recognized that the immediate task was to acquire political power.<h2>
<a name="CivildisobediencegaolandIndianindependence"></a>Civil disobedience, gaol, and Indian independence</h2>Early in 1930 Congress again launched a non-violent campaign of resistance under Gandhi's leadership. Its initial thrust was against the official salt monopoly. Nehru took charge of the civil disobedience campaign to manufacture salt in Allahabad district and sold packets of contraband salt. In April 1930 he was arrested and sentenced to simple imprisonment for six months. Lodged in Naini gaol, he was released in October but was arrested again after a week and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two years plus five months in default of fines. In prison again, he took up the writing of letters to his daughter, tracing the history of humanity.<br>
<br>In January 1931 Nehru was released, along with other leading Congressmen, to facilitate the effort at a settlement between Gandhi and the viceroy, Lord Irwin. Bereft of the support of his father, who died on 6 February 1931, he was disillusioned with the terms of the truce reached in March 1931. But he loyally accepted Gandhi's decision and devoted his attention to the agrarian crisis caused by the current economic depression in the United Provinces. The harassment or eviction of tenants by Indian landlords for their inability to pay rents led him to consider a no-rent campaign. He was arrested in December 1931 and sentenced to imprisonment for two years.<br>
<br>In gaol, mostly at Dehra Dun, Nehru recommenced writing to his daughter; the letters were published in 1933 as <span class="italic">Glimpses of World History</span>. He was released in August 1933, but arrested in February 1934 for sedition and sentenced to simple imprisonment for two years. Lodged first in a prison in Calcutta and then shifted to Dehra Dun gaol, he was released for eleven days in August 1934 as Kamala's health had worsened. He was then taken to Almora gaol, which was near the sanatorium to which she had been admitted. He wrote in these months his autobiography, which was published in 1936 and became a best-seller in Britain.<br>
<br>In May 1935 Kamala proceeded to Europe for treatment and, her condition becoming critical, Nehru's sentence was suspended to enable him to join her. She died at Lausanne on 28 February 1936. Elected in his absence as president of the Congress, Nehru returned to India to lead the party in the elections to the newly powerful provincial legislatures created by the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935. He campaigned throughout the country, travelling over 50,000 miles in five months, presided over the sessions of the Congress at Lucknow in April and at Faizpur in December 1936, and did more than any other individual to ensure an overall Congress victory. But he did not favour the acceptance of office which followed in eight provinces.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1938 Nehru visited the republican side of the battle-front in the Spanish Civil War, met politicians of all parties in Britain, and declined to meet Nazi officials in Germany, but went to Prague to demonstrate solidarity with the Czech government in their resistance to Hitler. The next year he visited China. The only activity within India at this time which gave him satisfaction was the chairmanship of the national planning committee set up by the Congress. He regarded this work as paving the way for the creation of a socialist economy within a democratic structure in free India. His priorities created tensions with other Congressmen, and with Gandhi himself; but Nehru was not prepared to divide the Congress on &#145;socialist&#146; issues.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in September 1939 Nehru's sympathy was with the allies, and he was eager that Britain should make it possible for the Indian people to join the war against fascism. But the expected response was not forthcoming. Instead, he was arrested in October 1940 for anti-imperialist speeches and sentenced to imprisonment for four years. In Dehra Dun gaol he started to write a second volume of his autobiography, but this was later incorporated into an analysis of India's past. In December 1941 he was released following an official decision to release all political prisoners. In March 1942 he was the principal spokesman of the Congress in discussions with Sir Stafford Cripps, who went to Delhi as the emissary of the British cabinet to seek to end the political deadlock and to gain Indian political co-operation in the war. Nehru was keen on a settlement which would enable the Congress to co-operate in the war effort, but the Cripps mission was a failure. Thereafter Nehru was unable to prevent a collision between the Congress and the government. Gandhi planned a Quit India movement of renewed civil disobedience, and on 9 August 1942 Nehru, along with other senior Congress leaders, was arrested. The Congress working committee was detained at Ahmednagar Fort without communication with the outside world. Here Nehru completed <span class="italic">The Discovery of India</span> (1946), a survey of India's history emphasizing the composite culture which in his view had held the country together over the years. He was released on 15 June 1945. He had spent altogether almost nine years in prison.<br>
<br>In the subsequent negotiations for the transfer of power from British to Indian hands, with M. A. Jinnah and the Muslim League now claiming a separate homeland for India's Muslims, Nehru hoped that, if the right to secede were granted, the Muslims would shed their fears and not in fact exercise that right. But the situation increasingly seemed to be one of insoluble conflict and escalating violence. In September 1946 Nehru became vice-president of the executive council in the provisional government. He held the external affairs portfolio and in that capacity he convened in March 1947 at New Delhi an Asian relations conference to enable the leaders of Asia to come together. (Here he asserted that a free India would develop an active concern in world affairs and would pursue an independent policy compatible with her own national interests. Self-respect demanded consideration of every issue on its merits and commitments only to the principles of anti-colonialism and racial equality and to the promotion of peace.) The provisional government meanwhile was unable to function normally once the representatives of the Muslim League joined it, and Nehru and the Congress recognized that partition of the country had become inevitable. (The degree of inevitability, the nature of Muslim demands, and Congress's response remain one of the most disputed aspects of India's recent history, however.) He worked closely with the last viceroy, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, and in May 1947 he persuaded Mountbatten to revise his current plan and avoid the danger of India being fragmented. The two dominions of India and Pakistan came into being on 15 August 1947. Mountbatten stayed on in India as governor-general. Lady Mountbatten became Nehru's close friend and, until her death in January 1960, helped to mitigate his loneliness.<h2>
<a name="PrimeministerofIndia"></a>Prime minister of India</h2>Nehru was sworn in as prime minister in 1947 and held the office until his death. His first task was to subdue the turbulence in India caused by the large-scale massacres and migrations which followed partition. The climax of communal violence was the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by a Hindu fanatic in January 1948. Nehru denounced Hindu chauvinist feeling and insisted that in a free India Muslims should be treated as equal citizens.<br>
<br>Relations with Pakistan were also tense. The ruler of Kashmir, a former princely state, delayed acceding to either India or Pakistan. To force the issue, tribesmen from Pakistan entered the state and advanced on Srinagar, the capital. The ruler now acceded to India and Indian troops were flown out to push back the tribesmen. Nehru secured the appointment of Sheikh Abdullah, a popular leader with secular views, as chief minister. He also offered to hold a plebiscite, after law and order had been restored, to ascertain the views of the people on the future of Kashmir, and referred the issue of Pakistan's perceived aggression to the United Nations. Although disappointed by the failure of the Security Council to reach a quick decision, Nehru agreed on 31 December 1948 to the ceasefire suggested by a commission sent out by the United Nations. This left a third of Kashmir in Pakistan's hands.<br>
<br>In August 1953, on Sheikh Abdullah's own position vacillating in favour of an independent Kashmir, Nehru permitted him to be dismissed and subsequently imprisoned. Nehru reconciled himself to the holding of a plebiscite and the possible loss of Kashmir to Pakistan, but reversed his position in 1954, when Pakistan concluded a military alliance with the United States. Nehru's contention was that this brought the cold war to south Asia and that Pakistan was seeking to settle the issue with superior American arms. Nehru was of Kashmiri descent himself, but many Indians recognized that the issue of Kashmir, and its presence with a Muslim majority in the Indian Union, was a vital and visible proof that India was a secular and not a Hindu state.<br>
<br>Nehru saw the political advantages of India remaining in the Commonwealth, and in April 1949 persuaded the Commonwealth prime ministers to agree to continued Indian membership even after she became a republic on 26 January 1950. Nehru found the Commonwealth a useful multiracial association for the exchange of views, and he resisted demands in India from time to time, and especially during the Suez crisis in 1956, that India withdraw from the Commonwealth. In 1961 he was among those responsible for securing South Africa's withdrawal by warning of the dangers of the Commonwealth disintegrating if apartheid were tolerated.<h2>
<a name="Foreignpolicyandnonalignment"></a>Foreign policy and non-alignment</h2>Nehru established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and appointed his sister Vijayalakshmi Pandit as India's first envoy to the USSR. He did not align India with either the United States or the Soviet Union, but at the start his sympathy was with the Western powers. In September 1948 he conveyed to the United States that there was not the least chance of India lining up with the Soviet Union in war or in peace. In October 1949 he visited the United States and emphasized repeatedly that detachment in the cold war did not imply indifference on basic issues such as freedom, justice, and aggression. He was well liked by the American public, but his discussions with President Truman and senior officials at Washington, where Vijayalakshmi Pandit was now ambassador, were not fruitful. Relations were soured by what Nehru regarded as the American tilt towards Pakistan and by American dislike of Nehru's support for the recognition of the People's Republic of China.<br>
<br>Nehru's sponsorship of mainland China was not born of any sentimental pan-Asian considerations. He thought that China's admission to the United Nations would make it easier for her to function normally in world affairs rather than as an outlaw state. Containment through friendship was also for India a preferable alternative to heavy expenditure incurred in building defences in the Himalayas. When, in 1950, China occupied Tibet, Nehru protested because he felt that India, while recognizing China's suzerainty over Tibet, had a right to express an interest in the maintenance of Tibet's autonomy. On China objecting to such intervention, Nehru avoided an open breach and discouraged the Dalai Lama from fleeing to India. In 1954 he concluded a treaty with China providing for the abandonment by India of all extra-territorial privileges in Tibet. But he missed the opportunity this provided for securing Chinese recognition of what was now a long common boundary defined for the most part, in India's view, by custom, usage, and tradition. To the Soviet Union Nehru was driven closer by circumstances. He tried to keep the problem of Kashmir out of the cold war; but from January 1952 the Soviet Union exercised its veto in the Security Council on all resolutions on Kashmir which were slanted against India. Nehru visited China in September 1954 and the Soviet Union in June 1955. He found his hosts eager to please, but Nehru retained his critical sense.<br>
<br>This non-aligned approach provided Nehru in the 1950s with a pivotal role in the world. His leadership enabled India to arrange in 1953 for the repatriation of prisoners taken in the Korean War and to implement the peace settlements in Indo-China in 1954. He was forthright in opposing racial discrimination in Africa and resisted, in all ways short of war, attempts to hold on to empire or to promote domination by settlers. He gave the lead at the Asian&#150;African Conference at Bandung in Indonesia in April 1955 and facilitated the acceptance of the People's Republic of China by most of the participating countries. Relations with the United States also improved at the time of the Suez crisis in October 1956, when both India and the United States condemned the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. In December 1956 he visited Washington, and, despite the feeling that he had been tardy in condemning Soviet action in Hungary, he was given a warm welcome by President Eisenhower.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarydemocracy"></a>Parliamentary democracy</h2>Within India, Nehru's main achievement was the establishment on firm grounds of parliamentary democracy. He made sure that the constitution which came into effect when India became a republic provided for adult suffrage, and toured the country incessantly to explain issues to a largely illiterate people and to teach them the value of the vote. In his time three general elections were held: in 1952, 1957, and 1962. He created the machinery of cabinet government and built up healthy traditions in the two houses of parliament. He strengthened a free press and enabled the judiciary to function with independence and full authority to protect the fundamental rights laid down in the constitution. Under Nehru's guidance India transformed herself from a traditional and passive into an open and participant society.<br>
<br>To buttress the parliamentary system at the local level Nehru elaborated schemes of community development and planned the setting up in all groups of villages of a council, a co-operative, and a school. In October 1952 fifty-five community projects covering about 17,000 villages were inaugurated; and in 1953 national extension services to provide trained workers were set up. By 1956 community development covered over a quarter of rural India. This policy did not succeed in improving the economic condition or strengthening the self-reliance of the peasant, but it helped in promoting political awareness.<br>
<br>In building a democratic system, Nehru utilized the Indian National Congress, which had a network of committees and cadres reaching down to every town and village. His relations with the deputy prime minister, Vallabhbhai Patel, were not without friction, but after Patel's death in December 1950 Nehru repulsed a challenge from within the party in 1951 to his secular approach. He was president of the party from 1951 to 1954, and even thereafter his control of the Congress was unquestioned. Throughout his years as prime minister the party was in office at the centre and, except for the two years 1957 to 1959 in the southern state of Kerala, in all the provinces. So relations between the central and the state governments caused Nehru no problems. He allowed the Congress parties in the states to choose their leaders and permitted these chief ministers to exercise autonomy. He utilized the Congress as a cementing force and to secure wide support for his policies. He himself functioned as a national rather than as a party leader. His bona fides were accepted by left-wing parties, and after 1951, when the Indian Communist Party renounced violent methods and agreed to work the parliamentary system, Nehru, approving of many of the party's objectives, permitted it to function and in 1957 to form a ministry in Kerala after it had secured a majority in the elections. He dismissed it two years later with reluctance as he believed that it had lost popular support, but he did not regard the Communist Party with its new tactics as posing a threat to the democratic process. On the right he regarded the Conservative Party which was formed in 1959 with contempt. The only political party which he regarded as threatening the unity of India was the Hindu Communal Party, and he gave it no quarter.<br>
<br>In internal administration Nehru had to act against his will in 1956, when he was obliged by public opinion to agree to the redrawing of provincial boundaries on the basis of languages. He regarded this as a marginal problem which merited low priority, but saw that the passions roused in all parts of the country by the love of local languages would, if not appeased, weaken the sense of community in India. He also gave way on the question of the continuation of English as an all-India language. While himself fluent in English and a sensitive writer of English prose, he believed that Hindi, spoken over a large part of northern India, and not English, known only to a small minority, should be the language linking the whole country. He therefore favoured the gradual abandonment of the use of English as an official language and its study only as a second language. In line with this, the constitution of 1950 stated that English would be used as an official language, in addition to Hindi, only until 1965. But, faced with agitation in southern India against the imposition of Hindi, Nehru realized that it endangered Indian unity and recognized the fear of the non-Hindi-speaking people that a ban on English would handicap them in the search for employment. So in 1959 he pledged that there would be no imposition of any language by decree and English would remain an associate, additional language for an indefinite period; the final decision on the replacement of English by Hindi would rest with those sections of the Indian people who did not know Hindi as a local language. In 1963 he translated this assurance into permissive legislation, providing that English &#145;may&#146; continue to be used after 1965, in addition to Hindi, for the official purposes of the Union and in parliament. He was unwilling to provide an explicit commitment that English would continue as an official language for ever, as this seemed to him unnecessary and even constitutionally improper; but he ensured that the protagonists of English need have no cause for concern. The use of English as an official and a linking language continues to this day.<h2>
<a name="Economicandsocialpolicy"></a>Economic and social policy</h2>One of the greatest problems facing independent India was economic development. Nehru recognized that it was an essential condition of genuine national freedom, and the only way eventually to meet the legitimate aspirations of India's peoples. In the late 1930s he had begun to concern himself with planning for India's economic future, and in March 1950 he constituted a planning commission, and from 1951 initiated a series of five-year plans, considerably influenced by the Soviet example. The objective was to create a self-reliant, self-generating modern economy, with a strong public sector in heavy and strategic industries, and a regulated private sector. The plan was to produce capital goods and growth through industrialization and import substitution: the state was to play the dominant role, controlling strategic and basic production, but leaving some space in other areas for a tightly controlled private sector. Following his personal commitment to furthering &#145;the scientific temperament&#146;, Nehru also encouraged India's atomic industry and the harnessing of her great rivers for energy production through several large dam projects. This broad range of planning undoubtedly helped to transform the economy in a way the imperial government neither wished nor would have been able to do. It provided the technological base for industrial development, created the facilities required for modern manufacture, and in the first decades of independence greatly increased industrial production, consumption of energy, and access to a broader range of consumer goods. Simultaneously India developed its capacity for conventional defence and raised a large corps of scientists, engineers, and technicians, despite the heavily arts-oriented educational system inherited from the British raj. It soon became clear, however, that Nehru's economic strategy was failing to address problems of large-scale poverty and poor agricultural production, problems which in turn hampered industrial growth, limiting domestic savings and the home market, and making India even more dependent on foreign aid and food imports. Consequently, by the end of the 1950s a new emphasis was given to family planning, in response to a now rapidly increasing population, and to bolstering agricultural production by various means. In the longer term it also became evident that tight state control of the economy was hampering growth and producing what came to be known as a &#145;licence-permit raj&#146;. In the late 1980s Nehru's grandson Rajiv Gandhi began dismantling the Nehruvian system, a process furthered by his successors in the 1990s after India's near international bankruptcy. However, it should be remembered that Nehru was dealing with the burdensome economic inheritance of an imperial regime at a time when the main examples of radical economic change and growth were the industrialization patterns of the Western world and of the Soviet Union, long before the dramatic successes of the export-led economies of south-east Asia in the later twentieth century provided alternative models.<br>
<br>Nehru's economic strategy emphasized growth rather than issues of distribution of goods and resources. However, in 1955 he committed the Congress to the creation of a &#145;socialistic pattern of society&#146;. His socialism was always more an ethical pledge than a doctrinal belief, reflecting the need to raise standards of living and provide more equality of opportunity rather than to further any dogma. He had realized by the mid-1950s that industrial growth had to be accompanied by an increase in agricultural productivity. Part of this new concern for agriculture was his decision to promote service co-operatives in every village as a prelude to co-operative farming over the next three years. The latter part of his strategy petered out; and none of Nehru's rural plans really tackled the fundamental investment and technological constraints on agricultural production. One of India's essential rural problems was still that of radically unequal access to land. Nehru had expedited the abolition of the largest landed estates soon after 1947, but had not ensured that this was followed up by redistribution of land to the peasantry, with security of tenure. Here the democratic process itself proved a hindrance, as the powerful and landed sector contrived to block truly radical land reform.<br>
<br>On social reforms, too, Nehru did not act quickly and fully: again he was hampered by widespread social conservatism and vested interests. He secured the statutory abolition of untouchability in 1955, and made its public practice a criminal offence. But the law by itself was not enough to ensure equality and opportunities for the most deprived and degraded in Hindu society. He assiduously proclaimed the need for a &#145;scientific temper&#146; in modern society, for the prevalence of reason and logic to ensure civilized behaviour. But, while he gave emphasis to the promotion of higher education and set up five institutes of technology and several national laboratories in various branches of pure and applied sciences, he failed to give priority to the directive in the constitution that free education should be provided by 1961 for every child up to the age of fourteen.<br>
<br>Entrenched obscurantism also stood in the way of the creation of the fully secular society to which Nehru attached prime importance. He wished religion to play no part in public life, and embedded this principle in the constitution. But his implementation of secular principles was incomplete. He failed to act, because of legal difficulties, on the resolution of 1948 of the constituent assembly banning political parties which exploited religion. He was opposed to the banning of cow slaughter, but allowed it to be included among the directive principles of state policy in the constitution. Above all, while in favour of a uniform civil law for all Indians as recommended in the constitution, he did not sponsor legislation imposing it. He had recognized from before independence the need to elevate the status of Indian women. But he did not wish to hurt the prejudices of Muslims immediately after partition by revising their personal laws. In 1951 he sponsored changes in the civil law only as regards Hindus. Monogamy was enforced on Hindu men, and rights of divorce, inheritance, and property were granted to Hindu women. But the lack of a uniform civil law in India has been a major hindrance to the development of an equal and secular society.<h2>
<a name="Internationalrelations"></a>International relations</h2>From 1956, when Nehru's reputation in India and the world was at its peak, problems and relations with other countries became more pressing. Believing that China had accepted India's stand that her northern boundary was established and not negotiable, he was surprised at Chinese incursions at three points across the border between Tibet and the Indian province of Uttar Pradesh and by the building of a road traversing Aksai Chin in Kashmir which linked Sinkiang (Xinjiang) with western Tibet. Nehru regarded these not as unfriendly acts but as matters for discussion. But the problem broadened in March 1959 with his humanitarian act of granting asylum to the Dalai Lama, who fled to India from Tibet. China's vituperative criticisms were not toned down by Nehru's directive to the Dalai Lama to refrain from political activity. In September 1959 China asserted that the whole boundary was unsettled and claimed about 40,000 square miles of what India regarded as her territory in Kashmir and in the north-east. Nehru decided that this could no longer be a matter for confidential correspondence between governments and informed parliament. The public reaction was intense and limited Nehru's scope for manoeuvre. It also drew India closer to the United States, and President Eisenhower was received cordially when he visited Delhi in December 1959.<br>
<br>Nehru was convinced that India's boundary was a firm one, sanctified by history, but he was anxious to avoid hostilities with China and willing to negotiate any minor rectifications that she might desire. He invited the Chinese prime minister, Zhou Enlai, to Delhi, but their talks in April 1960 were inconclusive. Thereafter China stepped up her incursions. Nehru persisted in his policy of avoiding confrontation, sending out patrols and establishing posts in Indian forward areas not taken over by China, and awaiting negotiations for a final settlement. He acted on the assumptions that China would not mount a large-scale offensive and that, if she did, Indian armed forces would be able to resist effectively and that such a war between India and China would not be confined to the border areas and would involve other countries.<br>
<br>Nehru had prevailed on Zhou to agree to officials on both sides examining the evidence pertaining to the boundary; and in the time thus gained he was able to turn his attention to other problems. In September 1960 he visited Pakistan to sign the agreement which had been reached on the distribution of the Indus Canal waters. The public goodwill created by this visit could not be translated into progress on the Kashmir question. Nehru's proposal that the ceasefire line, with a few adjustments, be converted into an international frontier was not acceptable to Pakistan. Later that year he went to New York to attend the session of the general assembly of the United Nations and sought to promote talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on disarmament. He also supported the intervention of the United Nations in the Congo and, at a time when India needed her troops at home, dispatched, at the request of the secretary-general of the United Nations, a brigade to the Congo. This was testimony of both his belief that the United Nations was an indispensable international organization and his commitment to freedom in Africa.<br>
<br>In September 1961, at the Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade, Nehru's influence was the decisive factor in giving priority to the urgent issue of disarmament over the receding issue of colonization. He criticized the Soviet resumption of nuclear testing, and this dampened the enthusiasm of his hosts when he proceeded from Belgrade to Moscow. But he did prevail on the Soviet authorities to be more responsive to suggestions for nuclear disarmament. In November 1961 he went to the United States to meet President Kennedy. Their personal meeting was not a success. Nehru was uncertain of Kennedy's resolution and popular backing, while Kennedy felt that Nehru was aloof, indifferent, and tired. But the relations between the two countries continued to be cordial. At Kennedy's request Nehru used his influence in Hanoi and Moscow to secure a ceasefire in Laos.<br>
<br>On his return to India, Nehru was confronted with a crisis developing over the Portuguese settlement of Goa, in western India. After the British withdrawal from India in 1947 and the transfer of the French settlements in 1954, the only foreign possessions in India were the pockets of Portuguese territory. No solution short of merger with India was acceptable to Nehru, but he sought to secure a peaceful transfer and to avoid the use of force as long as possible. Now, with reports of increased Portuguese repression and fading hopes of internal revolt or international intervention, especially by the United States, Nehru sanctioned the occupation of Goa by Indian troops in December 1961. It weakened Nehru's standing abroad as a champion of peaceful methods.<br>
<br>In 1962 China, attaching no importance to the reports of the officials who assessed the evidence regarding the border, continued to spread into Kashmir, and in September made an incursion south of the boundary east of Bhutan, which had been formalized by a treaty in 1914. The next month her troops moved across both the western and the eastern sectors of the boundary in large numbers. Though the Soviet Union, involved in the Cuban crisis, expressed for the first time sympathy for the Chinese position, and India appeared to be isolated, Nehru's morale was unshaken. He took direct charge of the defence portfolio and secured military supplies from western Europe and the United States. But to make it easier for the Soviet Union to revert to its earlier position friendly to India, he did not declare war on China or even break off diplomatic relations, refer the issue of Chinese aggression to the United Nations, or seek to form any military alliance. But his hopes of the Indian army drawing the Chinese onto the plains and holding them there were dashed. Indian resistance was instead offered on the mountain tops and was easily dispelled. In this critical situation, on 17 November he appealed to Kennedy for the dispatch of fighters to protect Indian cities from attack from the air, for assistance to the Indian Air Force in air battles, and for the loan of bombers to enable India to strike at Chinese bases and airfields. Kennedy promised to be as responsive as possible. But on 21 November the Chinese declared a unilateral ceasefire and withdrew from Indian territory in the eastern sector.<br>
<br>To Nehru the Chinese aggression was a personal as well as a national betrayal. He had extended his friendship and sponsored China's cause in the world; and for China to have given the impression to him and the Indian people that she recognized India's northern boundary and expected only some rectifications, to have crept gradually and by stealth into inaccessible and sparsely populated Indian territory, and then to have challenged the validity of the whole boundary and mounted large-scale offensives was to him a breach of faith. But he utilized the military setbacks to draw the people closer together. He accepted the proposals of Ceylon and five other non-aligned countries that a demilitarized zone be created in the western sector by the Chinese withdrawing 20 kilometres from their advanced position; and talks on the boundary recommenced thereafter. The Chinese rejection of these proposals strengthened Nehru's diplomatic position.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsanddeath"></a>Final years and death</h2>Nehru's health, sustained for years by regular yoga exercises, began to decline from April 1962, when a viral infection of the urinary tract brought on low intermittent fever, which he took nearly a month to shake off. But he never fully got rid of the infection and from this time a slight puffiness round the eyes was always noticeable. Recognizing that the end could not be far off, he took the first step in preparing for the succession by persuading the Congress Party in 1963 to direct all its leading members except himself to withdraw from office in order to devote themselves to organizational work. On 6 January 1964, at the Congress session in Bhubaneswar in Orissa, he suffered a mild stroke on the left side, and he inducted back into office Lal Bahadur Shastri, his henchman in Uttar Pradesh, ostensibly to assist him in his work, but in fact making clear whom he wished to replace him.<br>
<br>Nehru also took steps to settle, if possible, the Kashmir problem. In 1963 he had agreed, on the initiative of Britain and the United States, to resume talks with Pakistan. His objective was still a final settlement of Kashmir along the ceasefire line, and Pakistan's insistence on the transfer of almost the whole state led to the collapse of the talks. In 1964 he had Sheikh Abdullah released, and approved of his going to Pakistan to assess ways of reaching a settlement. Nehru himself was thinking in terms of a confederation of India, Kashmir, and Pakistan. But no tangible progress had been made when in Delhi, in the early hours of 27 May 1964, Nehru suffered a rupture of the abdominal aorta and died that afternoon. He was cremated the next morning on the bank of the Jumna River. The site has been planted with trees to form Shanti Vana (Wood of Peace) as a memorial to him.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>To have resisted imperialism, denounced fascism, transformed the nature of the Commonwealth and saved it from possible disintegration over South Africa, stood up for the rights of the African people, and shown the way for countries to steer clear of the cold war while being concerned with the problems of the world, places Nehru among the leading statesmen of the twentieth century. The shadows are created by his failure to stabilize India's relations with Pakistan and the deterioration of her relations with China. Seeking to eliminate in India the influence of religion in public life, he could not concede that Kashmir should be a part of Pakistan merely because the majority of its inhabitants were Muslims. The impact of the cold war in south Asia precluded in his opinion the possibility of a plebiscite; and his imaginative idea of a confederation was foreclosed, even if at all acceptable to Pakistan, by his death. The uneasy peace with China he sought to maintain with friendly, patient, and pragmatic diplomacy; but China was not to be deflected by such an attitude.<br>
<br>Within India Nehru consolidated a nation, established a democratic system and trained the people to work it, constructed a model for economic development, and set the country on the path to growth. But his belief in a phased approach led him to neglect agriculture until the late 1950s, and he gave social justice a low priority. He did not enforce land reforms, introduce universal primary education, or improve the status of all Indian women. He did not recognize that the growth of the population, unless controlled, would nullify every aspect of economic development. He insisted that India, as a whole, was not very heavily populated and family planning was only a part of the larger movement for raising the people's standard of living; and this would be attained by education and economic planning. But offsetting all the shortcomings of Nehru's policies was his provision of objectives&#151;unity, democracy, secularism, the self-respect of developing nations&#151;which have become, thanks to his hold on the public mind, which is second only to that of Mahatma Gandhi, part of the general consciousness of the Indian people.<br>
<br>Nehru was a handsome man, 5 foot 7 inches in height, and of a light, olive complexion. His premature baldness was usually concealed under a Gandhi cap. He discarded Western clothes in 1950 and dressed in a buttoned-up tunic with a red rose in the buttonhole and tight-fitting breeches. During summers in India he wore what is now known as a Nehru jacket. Entirely different from his mentor and confidant Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru none the less had great charisma, felt by the millions of his own compatriots and those many from abroad who found in him a profoundly attractive personality, and a sensitive interpreter of different cultures to each other.<br>
