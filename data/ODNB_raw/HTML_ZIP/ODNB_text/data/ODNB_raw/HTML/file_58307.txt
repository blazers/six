<span class="headword">Duncan <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Cotes]</span>,  Sara Jeannette</span>  (1861&#150;1922), <span class="occ">novelist and journalist</span>, was born in Brantford, Upper Canada (now Ontario), on 22 December 1861, the oldest surviving of the eleven children of Charles Lees Duncan (1832&#150;1907), a prosperous Scottish Presbyterian dry goods merchant, and Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bell (1837&#150;1931), from New Brunswick and of Irish descent. Educated at Brantford Ladies' College and Brantford Collegiate Institute, Duncan satisfied the expectations of her class and time by training as a teacher (at Brant County model school in 1879 and Toronto normal school in 1882). Between 1880 and 1884 she published poems and essays in Ontario newspapers, vigorously seeking a full-time position as a journalist. In 1884 she suggested to <span class="italic">The Globe</span> (Toronto) and <span class="italic">The Advertiser</span> (London, Ontario) that she might report on the New Orleans cotton centennial fair; her articles (under the pen-name Garth) appeared in several Canadian and American newspapers. From 1885 to 1888 she wrote for <span class="italic">The Globe</span>, the <span class="italic">Washington Post</span>, and the <span class="italic">Montreal Star</span>, and contributed to the important Toronto journal <span class="italic">The Week</span>. In the spring of 1888, though Canadian women were still unenfranchised, she was one of the <span class="italic">Montreal Star</span>'s parliamentary correspondents in Ottawa.<br>
<br>In September 1888, with the Montreal journalist Lily Lewis, Duncan began the unchaperoned round-the-world trip which produced her first book, <span class="italic">A Social Departure: how Orthodocia and I Went Around the World by Ourselves</span> (1890), dedicated irreverently &#145;to Mrs Grundy&#146;. It was a great success, making possible the international career which she had resolved upon as a young woman in Canada. Its journalistic flair and sharp social observation recur in all her later writing, whether in popular magazine genres or the one-volume commercial best-seller addressed to a middle-class audience. She wrote an interesting &#145;new woman&#146; novel (<span class="italic">A Daughter of Today</span>, 1894) and experimented with both Henry James's &#145;international&#146; themes, in the charming <span class="italic">An American Girl in London</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Cousin Cinderella</span> (1908), and his style, in the tedious <span class="italic">The Path of a Star</span> (1899). But Duncan's edgy satire would eventually isolate her between John Galsworthy, whose bourgeois subjects and audience she shared, and E. M. Forster, whose modernist vision she anticipated in her later critiques of Anglo-Indian life. In 1912 Forster described her as &#145;clever and odd&#151;nice to talk to alone, but at times the Social Manner descended like a pall&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 1.159).<br>
<br>Presented at court on 17 March 1890, Duncan married Everard Charles Cotes (1862&#150;1944), entomologist at the Indian Museum in Calcutta on 6 December 1890 in St Thomas's Church in that city. A child (undocumented) was reportedly born in 1900 but died within days. She resided in Calcutta, Simla, and Delhi and shuttled between India and London to manage her career. Her Canadian journalism of the 1880s has been studied, but her extensive Indian journalism (assisting her husband in editing the <span class="italic">Indian Daily News</span> from 1895) remains untraced; a formidable anonymous attack on Lord Curzon in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> of August 1900 has recently been identified. Her novels were usually serialized in London and the USA before publication in Britain and America. Duncan was market-wise and tailored much of her writing to popular expectations&#151;the children's book <span class="italic">The Story of Sonny Sahib</span> (1894) generated royalties until 1940&#151;but her experience of Anglo-India produced a core group of successful novels of increasing depth and post-colonial political insight: <span class="italic">The Simple Adventures of a Memsahib</span> (1893), <span class="italic">His Honor, and a Lady</span> (1896), <span class="italic">Set in Authority</span> (1906), and <span class="italic">The Burnt Offering</span> (1909). These novels centre on the Anglo-Indian professional class into which she had married; their social wit and ruthless irony sharply distinguish them from the popular Anglo-Indian romances of the period, a genre which she repeatedly satirized.<br>
<br>It is <span class="italic">The Imperialist</span> (1904), however, that is Duncan's major novel. A richly envisioned chronicle of political inexperience set in Brantford (here called &#145;Elgin&#146;), its combination of bourgeois subject and ironic viewpoint make it the first recognizably &#145;modern&#146; Canadian novel. It was, however, initially rejected by Canadian readers. Duncan invested funds in Canada and strove to have her books published there; she retained a strong belief in its tradition of egalitarian civility. Late-twentieth-century appreciation of <span class="italic">The Imperialist</span> would have consoled her for the post-1920 oblivion of her Anglo-Indian novels&#151;too conventional for modern readers and too sceptical for Edwardians.<br>
<br>Duncan's husband became proprietor of the Eastern News Agency, and when they were separated by the First World War, she turned London playwright, but without success; she never returned to India after 1915. Reunited in 1919, the Coteses established themselves prosperously in England, where family recollections describe Redney (as she was nicknamed) holding court, a formidable personality but of frail physique. Between 1914 and her death she published four late novels of lesser distinction. She died of pneumonia and emphysema on 22 July 1922 at her home, Barnett Wood Lodge, Ashtead, Surrey, leaving her estate to her husband, who remarried in 1924. She was buried in St Giles's Church, Ashtead.<br>
