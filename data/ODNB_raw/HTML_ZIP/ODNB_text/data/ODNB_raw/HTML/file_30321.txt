<span class="headword">Abercrombie,  Lascelles</span>  (1881&#150;1938), <span class="occ">poet and literary critic</span>, was born at Manor House, Ashton upon Mersey, Cheshire, on 9 January 1881, the sixth son, and the tenth of eleven children (two of whom died in childhood), of William Abercrombie (1838&#150;1908), stockbroker, of Ashton upon Mersey, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heron (1842&#150;1916). One of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30322/', "(Leslie) Patrick Abercrombie")</script>, the town planner. From boyhood Abercrombie was devoted to music and literature; his taste was fostered at a preparatory school, and also at Malvern College, where he read Greek and Latin eagerly. From 1900 to 1902 he studied science at the Victoria University of Manchester, but then turned to quantity surveying for a living, and to poetry for his vocation. He became a journalist in 1907, writing much for the Manchester, Liverpool, and national papers. His first poem, &#145;Blind&#146;, appeared in 1907 and his first volume of verse, <span class="italic">Interludes and Poems</span>, in 1908. On 23 January 1909 he married Catherine (1881&#150;1968), daughter of Owen Gwatkin, surgeon, of Grange-over-Sands; they had one daughter and three sons, the eldest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50766/', "David Abercrombie")</script>, became a phonetician, and the middle son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30742/', "Michael Abercrombie (1912&#150;1979)")</script>, a biologist. After a stay of more than a year in Birkenhead he and his wife migrated first to Herefordshire and then in 1911 to a cottage, The Gallows, at Ryton, near Dymock, Gloucestershire, where, inspired by happiness and by the noble scenery, he published some of his best verse. It included <span class="italic">Mary and the Bramble</span> (1910), <span class="italic">The Sale of St. Thomas</span>, act <span class="smallcap">I</span> (1911), and also some poetic plays in <span class="italic">New Numbers</span>, 1&#150;4 (1914), a periodical privately issued in partnership with Rupert Brooke, John Drinkwater, and Wilfrid Gibson [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/100255', "Dymock poets")</script>].<br>
<br>Abercrombie now came to be recognized as a leading poet of the new generation, distinguished for his lyrical power and speculative daring. He was praised by Robert Bridges for his lucid exposition of difficult themes, and Yeats was to devote eight pages of the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Modern Verse</span> (1936) to Abercrombie's poetry. He responded profoundly to natural beauty; his love poetry was ardent and exalted; and the mystical and metaphysical strain was ever present. It is heard again in the prose of <span class="italic">Speculative Dialogues</span> (1913), with its musings on life and love and on the last things; and also in several dramatic poems, such as <span class="italic">Deborah</span> (1912), which were not designed for the stage. But several were acted; of these the most notable is <span class="italic">The End of the World</span> (published in <span class="italic">New Numbers</span>), in which some homely folk are terrified by a false alarm that doomsday has arrived. His appreciative study of Thomas Hardy, published in 1912, gives some insight into his own poetic development.<br>
<br>Abercrombie was still to write his best verse, but his richest period of poetic production was over. The First World War came as a grievous interruption. Although a keen patriot, he was not strong enough for military service, and laboured in Liverpool as an examiner of munitions. After the war he took up a lecturership in poetry at Liverpool University; this appointment, which he held from 1919 to 1922, was an event that was to affect his whole career. He spoke upon his own craft; he held public audiences, not least by his rare gift for reading aloud; and he taught small classes the outlines of literary criticism and of its history. Abercrombie published many critical studies, often based on the public lectures which he gave at Cambridge, at Baltimore, to the British Academy, and elsewhere. They include <span class="italic">An Essay towards a Theory of Art</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Principles of English Prosody</span> (1923), and <span class="italic">Romanticism</span> (1926). In 1930 Oxford University Press published (in the <span class="roman">Oxford Poets</span>) Abercrombie's collected <span class="italic">Poems</span>, all but one, the richest and maturest of all, the completed <span class="italic">Sale of St. Thomas</span> (1930). Here, in a style which often rises to grandeur, he proclaims his faith in an omnipresent divine spirit embodying the law of ideal beauty. Abercrombie deepened and ennobled English metaphysical poetry. He charged it anew with his passionate feeling for the essential beauty of nature and of human nature. <span class="italic">Poetry, its Music and Meaning</span> (1932) ably states the artistic and critical convictions upon which his work was based.<br>
<br>A very active professor, Abercrombie rose quickly in the academic world. He occupied the chair of English language and literature at Leeds University from 1922 to 1929 and was Hildred Carlile professor of English literature in London University, at Bedford College for Women, from 1929 to 1935. In 1935 he became Goldsmiths' reader in English at Oxford and a fellow of Merton College. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge, Manchester, and Belfast, held several special lecturerships, including the Clark lecturership at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1923, and was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1937.<br>
<br>Abercrombie was closely involved in the Association of University Teachers as well as Labour student organizations and the League of Nations Union. From 1925 to 1936 he was president of the Society for Cultural Relations between the Peoples of the British Commonwealth and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (known as the SCR). His anti-Nazi activities included being a founder member of the German Relief Fund, the Academic Assistance Council, and the British Committee for the Relief of German Teachers. He was also a founder member of the (National) Council for Civil Liberties, and the Academic Freedom Committee.<br>
<br>Abercrombie's health declined, and he died of diabetes at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, St John's Wood, London, on 27 October 1938; he was survived by his wife. Two posthumous volumes of his work were published, <span class="italic">Lyrics and Unfinished Poems</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">The Art of Wordsworth</span> (1952).<br>
