<span class="headword">Barstow, Sir  George Lewis</span>  (1874&#150;1966), <span class="occ">civil servant and business executive</span>, was born in India on 20 May 1874, the second son of Henry Clements Barstow (1838&#150;1902) of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Cecilia Clementina, daughter of the Hon. and Revd John Baillie, canon of York. His grandfather was Thomas Barstow of Fulford Park and Garrow Hill, York; members of the family had been prominent merchant adventurers in York since the early seventeenth century. Barstow was a scholar of Clifton College, Bristol, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was in the first class in both parts of the classical tripos (1895&#150;6). He entered the home civil service in the Local Government Board in 1896 and transferred to the Treasury in 1898.<br>
<br>In 1904 Barstow married Enid Lilian, only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34433/', "Sir Alfred Tristram Lawrence (later first Baron Trevethin)")</script>. They had a daughter and two sons, the elder of whom won the DSO, and the younger of whom was killed in action, in the Second World War. Barstow became a principal clerk at the Treasury in 1909 and was appointed companion of the Bath in 1913. During the First World War he was primarily involved in the problems of supply to the armed forces. In the unprecedented circumstances of a world war he earned the gratitude and respect of many chiefs of the services for being so positive and helpful when dealing with their requirements. But he was also a firm advocate of tight fiscal control and he questioned Winston Churchill's decision, as minister of munitions, to build four large-scale electricity generating plants, when smaller installations could be built at a reduced cost that would still provide the power necessary for munitions production. He suspected Churchill of seeking &#145;not to provide for war necessities but to equip the country for after-the-war trade&#146;, a form of &#145;State Capitalism&#146; at the taxpayers' expense which his rigid Treasury outlook would not allow  (Peden, 118).<br>
<br>In 1919 Barstow was appointed an assistant secretary in control of one of the major functions of the Treasury, the supply services, and served until 1927 in the post, where he was notable not only for his efficiency but also for the humour he brought to his job. It fell to him to approve on behalf of the Treasury the settlement of the numerous points, some trivial in terms of money but some serious, and many of them highly technical, arising out of the financial control of the railways during the war. It was not always easy to see where the Treasury might benefit from pressing against a particular company&#151;and there were then over 100 of them covered by the agreement. But Barstow's acumen in discerning what to challenge and where to compromise impressed the highly skilled railway accountants with whom he dealt, and he showed an almost instinctive ability to combine a sense of equity with instant insistence on what was due to the public purse. He was promoted KCB in 1920.<br>
<br>During the British navy's transition from coal- to oil-firing before the war Barstow had been concerned in the Treasury with the negotiations whereby the British government took a substantial share in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. When he left the Treasury in 1927 he was appointed to be the government director of the Anglo-Persian (later Anglo-Iranian) Oil Company in succession to Lord Bradbury and he so remained until 1946. By the time that he left the Treasury he had been in the civil service for nearly thirty years, but his resignation may have been hastened by a clash of personalities with Churchill, who was chancellor of the exchequer in 1924&#150;9. Churchill was often impatient in his search for new ideas and methods, and Neville Chamberlain observed that he treated &#145;the older Treasury men like Barstow&#146; with such &#145;marked discourtesy&#146; that they &#145;eventually resigned&#146;  (Gilbert, 296).<br>
<br>Barstow was for many years also a director of the Midland Bank and other companies, but his most significant work after leaving the public service was on the board of the Prudential Assurance Company. He joined as a director in 1928, became deputy chairman in 1935, and was chairman from 1941 until his retirement from the board in 1953. He bore the heavy responsibility of chairman during the war years in London after 1941 and after the war he served the Prudential during a period of vigorous growth and reorganization. The board exchanged much of its earlier formal routine for a more lively and informed participation by all the directors who, under Barstow's chairmanship, learned to work in close intimacy with the management; the change had lasting effect.<br>
<br>As chairman Barstow regarded with trepidation the Attlee government's implementation of the insurance proposals in the Beveridge report. At the Prudential's annual general meeting in 1946 he hailed the &#145;humanitarian&#146; instincts of the <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span> then before parliament, but also warned against undermining the spirit of free enterprise and voluntary thrift  (Dennett, 293). And in May 1949 he went further, condemning the government's proposals to nationalize industrial assurance as &#145;an unmitigated disaster to the insurance industry and to the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 May 1949, 4f). He remained an active chairman until his retirement in 1953. At the Prudential, as in the civil service, Barstow was long remembered for his wit. He was a man of erudition and wide reading with catholic tastes both in literature and in the arts and a most retentive memory. A member of the Society of Dilettanti, he also possessed a marked talent for writing light verse which he employed for the pleasure of his family and friends. In the Confr&egrave;res, a well-known dining club, he excelled most in the cut and thrust of conversation across the table rather than in the more formal statements of points of view which followed dinner.<br>
<br>While still at the Prudential, and after his retirement, Barstow reorganized the finances of the Church in Wales as chairman of the finance committee at an important time. He took a great interest in the University of Wales, and in particular University College, Swansea, of which he was president from 1929 to 1955. He was also deputy chairman of the court of the University of London and a governor of Christ College, Brecon. The Barstows were devoted to their home, Chapel House, Builth Wells, Brecknockshire, where Barstow died on 29 January 1966.<br>
