<span class="headword">Bunyard,  Edward Ashdown</span>  (1878&#150;1939), <span class="occ">nurseryman and pomologist</span>, was born on 14 December 1878 at 74 King Street, Maidstone, the eldest son of <a name="cosubject_67780"></a><span class="headword">George Bunyard</span>  (1841&#150;1919), <span class="occ">nurseryman</span>, and his wife, Katherine Sophia Ashdown. His father was born on 5 February 1841 at London Road, Maidstone, the son of Thomas Bunyard (1804/5&#150;1880) and his wife, Mary Ann Butler (1814/15&#150;1889). He married Katherine Sophia (<i>b</i>. 1850/51), daughter of Charles Ashdown, paper maker, on 3 June 1873 and they had eight children. George Bunyard became one of Britain's foremost nurserymen, a leading fruit authority and head of George Bunyard &amp; Sons Ltd, of Allington and Maidstone. His grandfather, James Bunyard (<i>d</i>. 1844), had founded a nursery at Maidstone in 1796 and George entered this business aged fourteen in 1855, before becoming partner and manager in 1869. Severe family and financial problems brought the firm to bankruptcy in 1879, but George was able to get the business back and begin again. His fortunes had changed with a contract in 1880&#150;81 to supply half a million trees for Lord Sudeley's estate in Gloucestershire and the business continued to prosper with the enormous investment in fruit that occurred in the last decades of the nineteenth century as the modern British fruit industry was founded.<br>
<br>George Bunyard was at the centre of this activity. His nursery provided many of the trees for the new orchards and George was a key figure in the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) and the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers&#151;the main organizations that, through fruit shows and exhibitions, were encouraging the public to buy home-grown produce. George helped stage the historic National Apple Congress of 1883 and the Great Fruit Show at the Guildhall in 1896, for which he was made a freeman of the City of London, and he was among the first sixty to receive the prestigious RHS Victoria medal of honour in 1897. Throughout this period his firm was staging prize-winning exhibitions and he held many prominent positions on horticultural and trade societies: member of the RHS council, 1904&#150;13; member of the fruit and vegetable committee from 1880 and chairman 1901&#150;13; and master of the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers, 1906.<br>
<br>Bunyard was also a successful author: <span class="italic">Fruit Farming for Profit</span>, published in 1881, went into six editions and <span class="italic">The Fruit Garden</span> (1904), which he wrote with Owen Thomas, Queen Victoria's head gardener, became the amateurs' bible. He contributed the fruit section to <span class="italic">The Century Book of Gardening</span> (1899), and wrote <span class="italic">A Book on Apples and Pears</span> (1910), <span class="italic">Handbook of Hardy Trees and Shrubs</span> (1907), and <span class="italic">England's National Flower</span>, on roses, his favourite flowers. He died at his home, The Crossways, Mereworth, near Maidstone, on 22 January 1919, survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Edward Bunyard was educated privately at home with his brothers and sisters, followed by a period in France with leading nurserymen, before he entered the family business in 1896. By the time he took over on his father's death it had become one of the foremost British nurseries, with an international reputation for fruit. He directed the business until 1939, when he retired and became librarian of the RHS's Lindley Library in London, and editor of the society's publications. He remained a bachelor. His main interest was in pomology, the study of fruit. He made many distinguished contributions through papers and books: <span class="italic">The Handbook of Hardy Fruits</span> (1920) and <span class="italic">Stone and Bush Fruits</span> (1925) cover the main cultivars of all the fruits then grown in Britain and remain standard reference works. He was acknowledged as Britain's leading pomologist, the successor to the great Victorian authority Dr Robert Hogg. In recognition of his work in systematic pomology, Bunyard was made a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1914, and sat on its council from 1924 to 1927. He was ideally placed to study fruit, with a wealth of material growing in the nursery around his home at Allington. The Bunyard nursery claimed &#145;800 kinds true to name&#146;. He was also a gifted bibliophile, and sought out rare books about fruit, creating an extensive library. His botanic and historical studies included many other plants and particularly roses. <span class="italic">Old Garden Roses</span> has inspired many gardeners to plant the &#145;older roses&#146; since its publication in 1936.<br>
<br>Like his father, Edward Bunyard was a prominent figure in the horticultural world: council member of the RHS, 1924&#150;39; chairman of its fruit and vegetable committee, 1930&#150;39, and chairman of the library committee, 1925&#150;39. He was closely involved with the work of the newly established government funded fruit research institutes&#151;particularly East Malling Research Station, near Maidstone. In 1919 he founded, edited, and published the <span class="italic">Journal of Pomology</span>, which he ran for two years until it was adopted as the official organ of East Malling and Long Ashton Research Station. Bunyard was a member of the advisory committee to the national fruit trials formed in 1922, and also a key figure in setting up the associated national fruit collections, now internationally renowned and located at Brogdale, Faversham, Kent.<br>
<br>Edward Bunyard was a prolific writer, not only of scholarly works but also of lighter articles and books on the pleasures of the table. <span class="italic">The Anatomy of Dessert</span>, published in 1929, encompassed all the temperate fruits that could be enjoyed at the grand finale of dinner&#151;the fresh fruit dessert&#151;which was at its zenith in Victorian England. He wrote lyrically of the nuances of flavour to be found in fruit, especially the apple, and revived interest in many old favourites. The book was widely acclaimed and remains treasured by all fruit lovers. In the second (1933) edition he included a section on the best wines to enjoy with fruit, and in 1937 wrote <span class="italic">The Epicure's Companion</span> in collaboration with his sister Lorna. Bunyard's delight in good food and wine led to his close association with the London dining clubs&#151;the Wine and Food Society and the Saintsbury Club&#151;to which he brought up baskets of fruit and nuts from the nursery, and organized tastings.<br>
<br>Bunyard had embarked on a career in broadcasting with the &#145;radio gardener&#146;, C. H. Middleton, shortly before his tragic death on 19 October 1939. It was said that he had become extremely depressed over the war and this had led to his taking his life. He shot himself in the Royal Societies Club, St James's, London, with the gun he used for frightening the bullfinches from the cherries at the nursery. Bunyard died on the way to St George's Hospital, London.<br>
<br>Edward's younger brother <a name="cosubject_67781"></a><span class="headword">(George) Norman Bunyard</span>  (1886&#150;1969), <span class="occ">nurseryman and iris grower</span>, was born on 21 October 1886 at London Road, Maidstone. Norman joined the family nursery in Kent on his return from the war in 1919. The business was still famous for its fruit trees and ornamental plants, especially roses, and he took over as its head on his brother's retirement in 1939. Under his direction the firm had begun an interest in irises in 1920 and Norman Bunyard raised a number of fine cultivars. He helped found the British Iris Society in 1922 and was its secretary in 1922&#150;7 and for many years served on its committee. He married, and he and his wife, Dorothy Mary, had two daughters. Norman Bunyard died at home at 10 Faraday Road, Maidstone, on 9 February 1969.<br>
