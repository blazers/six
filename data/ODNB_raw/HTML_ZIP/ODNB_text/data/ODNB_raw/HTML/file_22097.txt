Although his time as co-monarch has largely vanished from the collective memory, to be replaced by images of invincible armadas and inquisitorial fires, it remains true that during his years of kingship (and especially during his two lengthy periods of residence in England) he was regarded by many of his adoptive subjects as hardly less than the political equal of his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18245/', "Mary I (1516&#150;1558)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Preparationtorule"></a>Preparation to rule</h2>Philip was born in Valladolid in northern Castile on 21 May 1527. His mother was Isabella (1503&#150;1539), the sister of the king of Portugal, and his father was Charles V (1500&#150;1558), king of Spain and Holy Roman emperor. Philip was brought up by his mother, during his father's many absences overseas, until her death in 1539. The empress fostered in him a love of the arts as well as an abiding affection for all things Portuguese, and also a deep if unostentatious religious faith, onto which was bracketed an unshakeable belief in God's providence and in his own part in the unfurling of the divine will. Philip was taught Latin, along with French, Portuguese, and some Italian, but although he was a competent linguist he was always reluctant to converse in languages other than Spanish, and he never troubled to learn English. A steady fare of humanist learning, including Erasmian texts on how to be a Christian prince, was supplemented by a musical education, leading to a brief passion for the guitar. His lifelong love of hunting began early, though he never cared much for the running of bulls.<br>
<br>Philip became nominal ruler of Spain in 1543, when he was sixteen. This was also the year of his first marriage&#151;to his cousin Maria (1527&#150;1545), another princess of Portugal. It was also when his father presented him with a famous set of instructions, which were to influence his reign in England as well as later in his life. The paternal advice might be summed up as a double warning. First, Philip was not to become prey to sexual licence at his still tender age because this, the emperor reminded him, had been the cause, through nuptial over-indulgence, of the premature death of Prince Juan, the heir to Philip's grandparents, Ferdinand and Isabella, and thus the reason why the Spanish thrones passed to the Catholic kings' Habsburg descendants. The emperor's second admonition was that his heir should never rely on a chief minister. He should always be sure to pit the leaders of different factions against each other, and every minister should be set to work according to his own talents. For instance, the emperor warned his son about the overweening ambition of the duke of Alva, who later accompanied Philip to England and then took the lead in Spain's response to the Dutch revolt. The duke was useful in military matters, but it would be unwise to let so powerful and ambitious an aristocrat take overall control of government. Charles was doubtless pushing at an open door, for his son was predisposed to such ideas, but for the rest of his rule, whether in England or in his hereditary territories, Philip never allowed a single minister to influence the royal mind.<br>
<br>In August 1548 Philip ceased to dine in public according to the rituals of the Castilian royal court, and for the first time was waited upon in a manner appropriate to the heir of the fifteenth-century dukes of Burgundy. This alteration in etiquette represented a conscious attempt by Charles to prepare his son for his first visit outside the Iberian peninsula. In November Philip set out on a visit which lasted two and a half years and took in not only the Habsburg dominions in Italy but also the Burgundian Netherlands and Germany. Charles's desire to preserve the links between Spain and his northern dominions helps to explain his decision to marry his son to Mary Tudor. Philip's first marriage ended in July 1545, when the princess of Spain survived the birth of their son, Don Carlos, for only a few days. In 1553, when Philip was about to marry another Portuguese princess, despite a liaison with Isabel Ossorio which lasted for several years, news reached the imperial court in the Netherlands that Edward VI had died and that Princess Mary was successfully fighting her way to the throne. Charles's links with Mary had long been very close. He had often protected her from the wrath of her father, Henry VIII, as well as from her half-brother's councillors. Moreover, they were first cousins. Katherine of Aragon was the sister of his mother, Juana the Mad.<br>
<br>Naturally Charles felt that it was his duty to support his cousin, not least because of her determination to restore the old religion. Initially Mary let it be known that she would take Charles as her husband, but the elderly emperor replied that he was too old and that his son was more appropriate. It is unclear how far Charles, still recovering from a nervous breakdown after his defeat by the protestant princes of Germany and their allies, was in charge of these negotiations, or whether they were in the hands of his haughty sister, Mary of Hungary. What is certain is that Philip's marriage to Mary Tudor gave Charles the upper hand in the squabbles then tearing the Habsburgs apart. There was glory attendant on the restoration of Catholicism within the Tudor dominions, but the English throne was also a pawn in Habsburg dynastic politics.<br>
<br>The problem was that Philip was indeed Charles's heir, but it was not entirely clear what he was heir to. Even his claim to be heir to the Castilian throne was debatable. If Charles died before his own mother, Juana the Mad, with whom he was co-sovereign of Castile until her death in April 1555, who would then take his place&#151;her second son Ferdinand, king of the Romans, or Philip, her grandson through Charles? A less hypothetical and more pressing problem was how Charles's empire outside Spain should be divided. In 1550 an unhappy compromise had been reached between Charles and his brother. Spain and the fabulously wealthy Netherlands would pass to Philip, but the hereditary lands in Germany and Austria, along with the imperial title, would fall to Ferdinand. On the latter's death Philip would become emperor, and thereafter that title would alternate between Vienna and Madrid. The English match threatened to upset these arrangements. If the Viennese branch of the family succeeded in winning Mary's hand in marriage, then its members would be able to mount an irresistible claim to the Netherlands. Not only were the Low Countries England's principal trading partner, but each country guaranteed the other's defence against France. In April 1553 Philip had been specifically warned by his father that he needed to take steps to court popularity in the Netherlands. Marriage to England's new Catholic queen now held out the immediate prospect of Philip's undisputed succession in the Netherlands.<h2>
<a name="Themarriagesettlement"></a>The marriage settlement</h2>Charles V's negotiators recognized that Philip could only be governor of England, as they put it. He could have no proprietary rights of his own to enable him to remain England's king if his spouse died childless before him. The imperial court was highly doubtful that any issue would survive to inherit, but if there were a son by Philip and Mary he would receive England and the Netherlands. If Philip's son from his first marriage, Don Carlos, were to die, then any surviving child from his second would also inherit Spain and the Italian Habsburg possessions, as well as the New World. If Philip and Mary had only a daughter, she was <i>not</i> to inherit the Low Countries unless she married with the approval of Don Carlos. Perhaps the most interesting clause was an alternative which the imperial court offered to the English for insertion into the draft, dealing with what should happen if Don Carlos died but there were two sons from the English marriage. This possibility was extremely remote, but it was suggested that if the English wanted a king of their own they could take the younger son, but on condition that England and the Netherlands went together. Charles told Renard that this was because England was the best ally for the Netherlands. Mary's privy councillors apparently declined to incorporate this into the treaty, however, and no provision was made for carving out a North Sea kingdom for a younger son. Also included in the treaty were stipulations that only Englishmen should wait on the king and take command of the country's forts, and that neither munitions nor the royal jewels should be at the king's disposal. Philip was even to surrender his right to take his wife out of the country.<br>
<br>At the heart of these restrictions lay England's relations with France. The question on everyone's minds was whether the new king's arrival would automatically involve the kingdom of his wife, which looked to Philip for protection from France, in a war against that country. Again, the imperial court was prepared to put English minds at rest. The settlement did bind all parties to mutual assistance but it was pointed out that this was no more than a reiteration of existing treaties in force since the days of Henry VIII, and that since Charles had not invoked these treaties to oblige England to join the current war with France, he would hardly do so now. Some of Mary's councillors none the less felt that a drift into war with France would be unavoidable. But according to the imperial ambassador, Simon Renard, Lord Chancellor Stephen Gardiner was determined to prevent it, and it was probably he who was responsible for a declaration in the second part of the settlement that England &#145;by occasion of this matrimony shall not directly or indirectly be entangled with the war that now is betwixt&#146; the emperor and the French king, and also that Philip would &#145;see peace between the said realms of France and England observed, and shall give no cause of any breach&#146;  (Hughes and Larkin, 2.25).<br>
<br>Philip did not receive a copy of the draft treaty until the new year. His disappointment was palpable. The normal prerogatives of a husband had been denied him, and he was effectively forced to share his wife with the English realm. On 4 January 1554 he denounced the terms of the treaty, declaring that he was not bound by an agreement that had been reached without his knowledge, and a copy of his protest was placed among the other papers dealing with the treaty. In the end he adhered scrupulously to the public restrictions placed on him in the settlement, but when he sent permission for his formal betrothal to be conducted by proxy in England on 6 March 1554, he sent his future wife neither a letter nor a gift, as Renard uneasily pointed out. Philip's Spanish advisers, too, had a grievance. They felt that their equivalents in Brussels had pursued their own interests during the negotiations, and indeed, in order to avoid a transfer of power to Vienna, the emperor's counsellors had been content to arrange a loose alliance between England and the Netherlands, instead of ensuring the former's subservience to the heir to the Spanish thrones.<br>
<br>These misgivings were not voiced in public, and the marriage negotiations were ratified by the English parliament during January 1554. Gardiner announced the successful outcome of the negotiations to MPs in the presence chamber on the 14th and, in an attempt to fend off hostility to the queen's marriage to a foreigner, introduced the constitutional restrictions placed on Philip's kingship by first thanking God that &#145;so noble, worthy and famous a prince would vouchsafe so to humble himself as, in this marriage, to take upon him rather as a subject&#146;  (Nichols, 35). However, it was not until 13 July that the prince of Spain sailed out from La Coru&ntilde;a. This was partly because Sir Thomas Wyatt's rebellion had raised doubts about Philip's security, but equally important was the need to settle the government of Spain. There was little need to hurry, however, since Philip's betrothal to Mary blocked any attempts from Vienna or Paris to bid for the hand of England's first virgin queen. The new king sailed into Southampton Water accompanied by eighty large ships and over a hundred smaller ones, and stepped ashore on Friday 20 July. He moved on to Winchester, and shortly after 10 o'clock on the night of 23 July crossed from his lodgings to the palace where the queen was housed. According to a Spanish reporter, the queen was in her privy chambers and chaperoned by a handful of senior councillors and her ladies-in-waiting. When Philip arrived, the queen, with wifely subservience, &#145;made her way to the door where the prince kissed her, which is the custom of the country&#146;  (Mu&ntilde;oz, 92). The 27-year-old Philip was fair-haired, with blue eyes, and despite some awkwardness of face was regarded as attractive, not least for his shapely legs. He was also experienced in the ways of the world. A widower with a nine-year-old son, he had had several love affairs and also had a reputation for carousing. His bride, though sexually inexperienced, was far from blushing, having been solemnly betrothed to her husband's father before he married. Aged thirty-seven, Mary was of a different generation from Philip. She was the granddaughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, whereas he was their great-grandchild; revealingly, Philip referred to her as his &#145;cousin and aunt&#146;.<h2>
<a name="KingofEngland"></a>King of England</h2>The wedding of Philip and Mary in Winchester Cathedral was conducted with enormous pomp and ceremony on the morning of Wednesday 25 July 1554. It was also fraught with difficulties of protocol, despite the fact that Philip had been made titular king of Naples by the emperor so that he could marry Mary as an equal. Thus Philip arrived at the cathedral to await the queen, and at the following banquet he was served with silver whereas the queen was served on gold. These apparent indignities barely mattered, however. One reason was that Mary accepted that Philip held the upper hand in their marriage, despite Gardiner's earlier protestation that it was as a subject that Philip was marrying her, and subtly worked to undermine the restrictions of the marriage settlement. Philip was accorded precedence within the marriage and in the country. His name preceded his wife's, in the dating of regnal years as well as in acts of parliament. Within days of the wedding the queen also contrived that conciliar business was to be transacted in such a way that Philip and his courtiers could find out what was being done in their joint names. It was determined that &#145;a note of all such matters of Estate as should pass from hence should be made in Latin or Spanish from henceforth&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1554&#150;6</i>, 53). There were also efforts to create an image for Philip as England's king. The most successful of these came in September 1554, when new coins appeared on which both Philip and Mary appeared in profile. The king was shown on the dominant or right-hand side, with a single crown floating above them both. This iconographical shift away from the constitutional concessions made on Philip's behalf was noticed by contemporaries. One pamphleteer complained that Philip was being turned into a &#145;king of England indeed&#146;, with his name now appearing on proclamations and on &#145;the coined money going abroad current&#146;; and in another reference to the coinage Anna Hooper, wife of Bishop John Hooper, remarked to Heinrich Bullinger that the king and queen were like &#145;Ahab and Jezebel&#146;  (Richards, 915&#150;16).<br>
<br>A further reason for the unimportance of the issue of precedence lay in the remarkable fact that when Philip set foot in England, he intended to stay only for a week or two. Once the marriage was consummated, he planned to sail to the Netherlands and deliver to his father the army that he had brought with him from Spain; for that reason, neither the Spanish troops nor their horses were disembarked. It seems unlikely that Mary had any idea that her conjugal life was intended to be so brief, but it was only after he had landed in England that Philip heard the unwelcome news that, following the repulse of a French invasion of the Low Countries, his father&#151;or perhaps his father's ministers&#151;no longer wished to see a rival court in the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Philip fortunately had more than enough to occupy him during summer 1554. He had to get to know his wife. Language was a difficulty. Mary could understand Spanish, her mother's language, but could not speak it. The king spoke in Spanish and the queen replied in French. Their marriage was obviously not one made in heaven, but all observers noted how respectfully Philip treated his wife, even if her penchant for dressing in the French fashion added to her dowdiness in Spanish eyes. As with all royal marriages of the time, the king and queen spent much of their lives apart. Mary continued to live on the &#145;king's side&#146; of her palaces, while Philip moved into the vacant side traditionally allotted to consorts. The organization of his court also took up much of Philip's time. Not only had Philip arrived with 6000 soldiers and 1500 cavalry, who soon sailed on to the Low Countries, but he was also accompanied by a household of some 3000 people. In addition to trusted advisers like Gonzalo P&eacute;rez and Ruy G&oacute;mez da Silva, there were also at least two dukes (Alva and Medinaceli), a bevy of marquesses and counts, bishops, confessors, choristers and instrumentalists, together with kitchen staff and cleaners.<br>
<br>Communications between London, Brussels, and Madrid had been so poor that Philip barely realized that in accordance with the marriage treaty&#151;which had stipulated that the king &#145;was to receive and admit into the service of his household and court gentlemen and yeomen of the said realm of England in convenient number&#146;  (Hughes and Larkin, 2.24&#150;5)&#151;another complete household, staffed only by Englishmen and rapidly trained in what was assumed to be Burgundian ceremonial, awaited him on his arrival. The question which then arose, of which nation should actually wait upon Philip, threatened to develop into an international incident. Although the son of the duke of Infantado was permitted to act as a cup-bearer, the duke of Alva was forced to concede to Lord Williams of Thame the wand of office that was the symbol of headship over the royal household. Spain's greatest general even found himself struggling to proffer King Philip the royal napkin. Though Alva stayed longer than most, the other distinguished members of Philip's entourage soon headed across the channel in search of military glory.<br>
<br>Philip sought his father's advice about how to conduct his life in England, now that he was required to stay longer than expected. He was especially concerned at the way in which English noblemen, professing a dubious religion, invaded his privy chamber. The emperor told him always to appear affable, and that he might stroll through the palace and allow access to his person that way. Affability came at a price, as it had been agreed that Philip would have to pay for his own household. The fleet which brought Philip over had also carried a large number of gold and silver ingots. On 2 October 1554 twenty cartloads of these precious bars were transferred to the safety of the Tower of London, and soon afterwards it was ordered that they be turned into coin of the realm. In January 1555 the king's treasurer, Domingo de Orbea, received &pound;40,507 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. sterling from the officers of the royal mint. The money was desperately needed if Philip was to pay the daily expenses of his court, and also keep faith with nearly two dozen councillors and advisers of the queen whom on Renard's advice he had pensioned most handsomely.<br>
<br>Following his ceremonial entry into London in August 1554, King Philip rarely ventured further afield than Hampton Court, Greenwich, or Windsor. At Westminster, as in other palaces, he continued to be lodged in the apartments normally reserved in palaces for the queens of England. During his first few weeks in residence, he paid out of his own coffers for some small-scale building work, possibly to increase office space for his many advisers and attendants. He was normally protected by a special bodyguard of some 100 archers whom he brought with him from Spain. Although there were constant fears for his safety, there is little evidence that his daily routine was unduly constrained. Whenever he could, he seems to have enjoyed hunting in the royal parks. As for day-to-day business, it was organized around his liturgical requirements. He would hear mass either in a private chapel or in one of the chapels royal, with his own party meeting the queen's so that both could process together to hear mass. According to the Venetian ambassador, he attended meetings of the privy council on Tuesdays and Fridays, though for linguistic reasons his participation was probably only a formality, except perhaps when the future of the church lands was under discussion. It was also reported that Philip gave public audiences, at which no mediator was required even for the most humble petitioner. His own accounts reveal that he was sometimes presented with small gifts of food or wildfowl.<h2>
<a name="PrincessElizabethandreligiousissues"></a>Princess Elizabeth and religious issues</h2>Philip and his wife were not always of one mind. In her dealings with the daughter of Anne Boleyn, Queen Mary's feelings were always those of the daughter of Katherine of Aragon. But in the euphoria that greeted him on his arrival, Philip was able to save Elizabeth, in the words of Jane Dormer, one of Mary's ladies-in-waiting, from &#145;extreme punishment&#146;  (Rodr&iacute;quez-Salgado and Adams, 313). Doubtless advised by Baron Paget, who consistently tried to protect Elizabeth, the king and his counsellors accepted that any judicial attempt on the princess's life would inspire further rebellions, quite apart from opening the way for Mary, queen of Scots, to claim the English throne for herself and her husband, the French dauphin. Instead Philip tried to engineer a safe Catholic marriage for Elizabeth, preferably with Duke Philibert Emmanuel of Savoy, who came to England on a family visit in December 1554. But the princess refused to entertain the idea of such a marriage, and anyway the queen was disinclined to allow her half-sister the full royal honours necessary for such a prestigious union. Though it was rumoured that in 1557 Philip asked his confessor, Fray Bernardo Fresneda, to raise the possibility of the Savoy marriage for Elizabeth with both Mary and Cardinal Pole, he was prevented from actively reviving his plans until the very end of Mary's life.<br>
<br>Elizabeth apart, the most pressing political issue for Philip during the first few months of his reign was the embarrassing fact that his new country was still constitutionally, if not spiritually, separated from Rome. Philip was advised in England on theological matters by a small junta of churchmen, which, in addition to Fresneda, included Bartolom&eacute; Carranza, the future archbishop of Toledo and a friend of Cardinal Pole, as well as the great jurist Alonso de Castro. Mary probably planned to restore papal authority in her first parliament at the same time as she successfully repealed the Edwardian religious legislation, but the attempt failed, and she seems thereafter to have been more than happy to leave the restoration of Roman primacy to her husband. Working closely with Paget, Philip and his advisers brokered a compromise with the nobility of England, in which the latter's right to retain former church lands was guaranteed even after the reintroduction of papal authority. Apparently Philip employed Carranza to press Cardinal Pole to accept this compromise, while at the same time using the Habsburgs' diplomatic network to put pressure directly on Pope Paul III to insist upon the concession. Meanwhile, the king favoured summoning a parliament for November 1554 in the expectation of negotiating a satisfactory agreement. The king and queen attended on several occasions, and a speech advocating peaceful union was read out in Philip's name.<br>
<br>The consequent restoration of English communion with Rome greatly enhanced Philip's political authority. In January 1555 the scope of the treason laws was extended to give him protection during Mary's lifetime. It was even possible to amend some of the restrictions of the marriage treaty. It had initially been laid down that Philip should retain only his kingly title if the queen died after giving birth to an heir, with the regency being exercised by a council of nobles. Now it was decided that Philip should be guardian of the kingdom until the heir was eighteen, if a son, or fifteen, if a daughter.<br>
<br>Philip's role in the persecution of protestants is hard to pin down. During an exchange of memoranda with his father, one of the headings for discussion referred starkly to &#145;greater firmness in religion&#146;. But it is unclear whether Philip was seeking his father's support for intensified persecution, or asking for advice concerning the wisdom of moderation. Ambassador Renard persistently advised Philip, as a foreign-born king, not to become tainted by the campaign against protestants. The question of Philip's involvement is also complicated by the divisions within his own household. The Dominican Carranza was active in seeking Thomas Cranmer's death, once it became clear that the archbishop would not give an unequivocal recantation. But the Franciscan Castro advocated a degree of moderation. Matters came to a head on Sunday 10 February 1555, when Castro preached before the king at court. According to John Foxe, the friar argued from the pulpit that the bishops had &#145;learnt it not in scripture, to burn any for his conscience: but the contrary&#151;that they should live and be converted&#146;  (Foxe, 6.704&#150;5). But despite a temporary halt to the burnings following Castro's sermon, probably all that can be said is that Philip did not intervene on either side, which is tantamount to saying that he saw no reason to restrain his wife or their ministers.<br>
<br>Where Philip openly involved himself in religious affairs was in his enthusiastic and public endorsement of the restoration of Catholicism. His chapel choir joined forces more than once with the choristers of St Paul's Cathedral, and he also attended services outside the palace. According to his household accounts his organist received additional payments for assembling a portable organ whenever Philip ventured into the city to hear mass or attend other public festivals. Equally significantly, the king allowed his own churchmen to show their support for the restoration of the old religion. Vestments were imported from the Low Countries to help restock the new religious houses. Carranza even composed his ecumenical <span class="italic">Catechism</span>, for which he was later suspected of heresy, with the conversion of English protestants in mind.<br>
<br>In addition to overseeing his wife's direction of English affairs, Philip also had to play a part in the administration of the Habsburg empire. Although his titular role as king of Naples did not include the actual administration of the kingdom, which the emperor retained, Philip mediated between his sister Juana, the new regent of Spain, and his father's court in the Netherlands. Philip never knew when his father might summon him from England, but he and his youthful Hispanic advisers were preparing for the day when they would take over control of Charles's far-flung realms from the latter's ageing Francophone court. He had his own private council, headed by the aged Juan de Figueroa. Interestingly, many of his advisers lived out of court and lodged with English families. Gonzalo P&eacute;rez lodged with the young William Cecil, while Carranza stayed with Bishop Bonner of London. There was in fact one issue over which Philip and Mary presented a united front against Charles V. Philip was able to use his new position as a king of England to press for an end to hostilities with France. Philip's Spanish advisers were concerned that when he inherited the Netherlands and Spain he would not have the ability, without the empire, to defend the Low Countries against an aggressive France. In their efforts to end the Franco-imperial conflict they made common cause with Cardinal Pole, whose legatine mission was to promote peace among all Christian princes. In May 1555 Philip and Mary, together with the papacy, sponsored a peace conference at La Marque, in the English enclave around Calais.<h2>
<a name="KingshipinIrelandandEngland"></a>Kingship in Ireland and England</h2>Philip took his titular responsibilities as king of Ireland seriously. In the mid-1530s Charles V had given lukewarm support to Irish Catholics resisting Henrician policies in Ireland, and Philip now joined with Mary in supporting a partial restoration of the pre-Reformation <i>status quo</i> there. Mary's hereditary rights in Ireland were reinforced when both she and her husband were specially invested by Pope Paul IV as monarchs of the island on 7 June 1555, a step which also reinvigorated Rome's claim to ultimate lordship. Links with the Old English aristocracy were also reanimated. Together they supported moves to allow the Geraldine earls of Kildare to recover something of their former glory, with Gerald Fitzgerald being restored as eleventh earl in 1554, while his wife, Mabel, was one of the ladies of Mary's court whom the Spanish courtiers treated with greatest respect. In 1557 forfeited Irish lands in Laois and Offaly were shired to form King's county and Queen's county. Philip was not averse to intervening in person, as when he wrote late in 1555 to English councillors concerning the Irish lands of one Christopher Bloncquet, quite probably a member of the important Plunket family. Perhaps his most important involvement with Ireland came in September 1555, when Lord Clinton was being proposed as lord deputy for Dublin. Although Philip had already left for the Netherlands, and had relations with France principally in his mind, he wrote to his English ministers that this was not the time to be sending such an experienced soldier away from England. Another of the Irish magnates whom Philip encouraged was Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond. On 13 May 1557 the king wrote to thank him for his work in defending Ulster from the Scots, and shortly afterwards Ormond returned the favour, asking Philip at the start of Elizabeth's reign to appoint a Catholic king for Ireland.<br>
<br>Overall, there is little evidence that during his first visit Philip wished to direct England's affairs in anything but the most general terms. The day-by-day running of the country was of no interest either to him or to his Spanish advisers. Yet his ability to determine the direction of English affairs should not be underestimated. He was primarily responsible for engineering the restoration of papal authority on terms acceptable to the nobility. He successfully defended Princess Elizabeth. He even manipulated English policy so as to put pressure on his own father. Whereas at first he was seen as defending England against a French invasion, on his second visit he persuaded Mary to countenance English involvement in war against France. Sometimes Philip flexed his political muscles in public, as in healing the breach with Rome. More often he acted behind the scenes, through influential councillors like Paget and Pole, or by persuading his wife. In so doing he gave a highly intelligent response to a delicate constitutional position. The bravura show of disdain with which he had first reacted to the marriage treaty had slowly given way to the realization that as king of England he could serve God by restoring the true religion, and his future empire by securing the transfer of power in the Netherlands. He owed his influence to the fact that Mary's compliance and the patriarchal values of the time were more than enough to override the limitations imposed on his freedom of manoeuvre by the marriage settlement. But that influence was in itself a diminishing quality, in that implicit in his authority was the assumption that he would father an heir. Thus the settlement of 1554 had made it plain that only a royal birth would allow Philip to retain the title of king of England after his wife's death, even if his powers of regency had been extended. Probably only the birth of a child would have secured for Philip the coronation at Westminster which he felt was his due.<br>
<br>Philip remained in England until the beginning of September 1555. His father, and perhaps still more his father's courtiers, were reluctant to summon him to the Netherlands, but his departure was further delayed by the belief that the queen was expecting a child. By the time of Pole's arrival in England in November 1554, Mary believed that she was pregnant. On 28 November a service of thanksgiving was held in St Paul's Cathedral and throughout the land prayers were said after every mass for the birth of a prince. The news of Mary's pregnancy was not good news for everyone, and a full-blown conspiracy was allegedly planned to kill the king and queen at a demonstration of cane-play which Philip organized at this time. Dressed in purple and silver, and with the queen looking on, Philip took part in Diego de C&oacute;rdova's team. The indifference of Londoners, who did not comprehend the rules of the game, combined with the atrocious weather, led to the spectacle's being abandoned before the third round, which was later said to have been the point at which a group of heavily armed men was to rush forward and murder the royal pair. By the end of April 1555 a rumour spread from London to the Low Countries that the queen had given birth to a son, but by July Philip had finally given up all hope of an heir. On 29 August he left Greenwich, and travelled with a small entourage by Canterbury to Dover. His ecclesiastical household stayed behind for several months, along with his Spanish and Flemish guards, but it is not clear whether this was a sign that he seriously intended to return to London or merely a sop to his wife, who increasingly felt herself to have been abandoned.<br>
<br>Despite Philip's absence in the Netherlands, he was still able to monitor English affairs. Before his departure he had been instrumental in setting up a &#145;select council&#146;. As in so many things, Philip was co-operating with William Paget. He drew up a memorandum whereby the select councillors were to reside at court, report three times a week to the king or queen, and brief the other councillors each Sunday. Philip asked Cardinal Pole to supervise the select council, and he also requested the privy council as a whole to defer to the cardinal, even though Pole's ecclesiastical scruples had previously made him hesitate to take a councillor's oath of obedience. After the first few months, the select council's reports to the king, and his own replies, became increasingly infrequent, but it was not an ineffective channel of communication. It was through this medium, for instance, that the king gave detailed advice about the preparations for the parliament summoned for later that year, in the process shedding a rare gleam of light on his attitude towards religious persecution. In August 1555 Philip secretly discussed Gardiner's plans for that parliament with English representatives at Brussels. They consisted of three points: that only Catholics should be returned as MPs; that offences against religion should be dealt with in the localities; and that they (presumably the MPs&#151;the text is ambiguous) should hear mass daily. The king was taken aback to be told that while the first proposal was unexceptionable, the other two were otiose. On 15 October 1555 Philip authorized a message to the English parliament. He cited his absence as a reason for greater consideration to be given to his wishes, and added, according to the Venetian ambassador, that &#145;the queen, who represented their joint authority, would act in his stead&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1555&#150;6</i>, 228).<br>
<br>Philip also had less formal channels of communication. Thus when Gardiner died on 12 November 1555, the members of Philip's household left behind in England, led by Carranza, put concerted pressure on him to advise the queen against appointing Paget as chancellor, even though the marriage settlement had stipulated that appointment to public office was to remain in the queen's gift. They wanted another churchman to succeed Gardiner, and though it cannot be proved that Philip's intervention was decisive, Paget was not appointed and Archbishop Nicholas Heath became chancellor. During this first absence from England there was, however, one issue over which Philip certainly did not manage to have his own way. This concerned his coronation. According to the Venetian ambassador in Brussels, the king intimated to Mary that they might be reunited the sooner if she were to arrange this. Mary told him that parliament would not tolerate his being crowned, and Philip wisely let the matter drop.<h2>
<a name="WarwithFranceandthedeathofMary"></a>War with France and the death of Mary</h2>The La Marque peace conference failed, and consequently Philip inherited an empire still at odds with France. During his first absence from London his father had bequeathed all his dominions to his son, allowing only the imperial title and the Austrian lands to pass to Ferdinand. Since renewed hostilities with the French were only a matter of time, it became increasingly urgent for Philip to draw England into this continental war, even if it meant infringing his marriage settlement. It could be argued that Philip's war against France was a different conflict from his father's, but Mary's advisers were none the less minded to put up a stout rearguard action against English involvement. Philip concentrated on winning over the queen. To achieve this he returned to England on 18 March 1557 and stayed for barely three months. Mary was most anxious that her husband be royally entertained. She ordered her players to do the best they could, despite their protestations that the king had already seen all their productions as well as many others &#145;fair and rich beyond the seas&#146;. Eventually, on 25 April, a revival of a &#145;Great Mask of Almains, pilgrims, and Irishmen&#146; was &#145;shown before the queen's majesty in his highness's court at Whitehall&#146;  (Feuillerat, 245, 225). There were other distractions from war. The king and queen were visited by two relatives, the duchess of Lorraine and Philip's half-sister Margaret of Parma. Rumours spread that the duchess was the king's lover, though the queen was probably just as perturbed by the problems of precedence which overshadowed their visit. Apparently Margaret left for Italy in a huff after she was inadvertently locked out of the chapel at Greenwich by the duchess's servants. Then a French-backed attack on Scarborough at the end of April gave the queen a pretext to declare war on 7 June. Mary accompanied Philip to Dover, where in mid-afternoon on 6 July he bade farewell to the queen and to his English kingdom for the last time.<br>
<br>Once over the channel, Philip awaited the arrival of an English army of some 7000 men and 200 gentlemen and officers. It was eventually brought over by the eager-to-please William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, who doubtless had his eye on a dukedom. Among the army's strengths were sappers from the west country whom the king had been particularly anxious to recruit. The expedition was significant politically as well as militarily. Philip was damping down the flames of religious division in England by uniting his subjects in a war against their old enemy. The earls of Arundel and Rutland, along with the young Viscount Montagu, took part in defensive operations, while former supporters of Wyatt's rebellion used the war to display their loyalty to Philip and Mary. Even the relatives of Lady Jane Grey rallied to the cause. King Philip missed the battle of San Quentin on 10 August because he was waiting for his English regiments to cross the channel and break out from the pale; however, they arrived in time for him to lead them in the siege of the city, which fell on the 27th. During the siege the king called upon his English archers to shoot over the city wall. Wrapped around their arrows was a message calling upon the inhabitants to surrender to their lawful king, an allusion to Queen Mary's hereditary claim to the French throne. But the defenders responded in kind with the words &#145;<i>Regem habemus</i>&#146;&#151;&#145;We have a king!&#146; Although subsequent events overshadowed England's military contribution to the campaign, Philip had achieved a stunning political success. The weakness of his position as the uncrowned partner in his marriage to Queen Mary had been largely nullified by his riding at the head of an English army, and it appeared now that he only needed to cross the Narrow Seas for a coronation to be his for the asking.<br>
<br>There seemed to be no end to Philip's run of luck. In December 1557 Mary informed him that she was pregnant. Although it was six months since they had parted, the queen had wanted to wait until she was certain. Then fate intervened, with loss of Calais on 10 January 1558 casting a pall over Philip's successes of the previous autumn. Though no Spanish soldiers were in the pale at the time, the king offered to mount a campaign for its recapture, only to be told that his wife had no reserves to assist a counter-offensive. On the same day that he commiserated with the English councillors over the loss of Calais, on 21 January, he also wrote to Pole. The cardinal had sent him letters containing &#145;news of the pregnancy of the Queen, my beloved wife, which has given me greater joy than I can express to you&#146;. It was, Philip continued, &#145;of the greatest importance for the cause of religion and the welfare of our realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554&#150;8</i>, 340). But the queen's pregnancy was quickly recognized for what it was, irremediable illness. By May Philip's letters ceased to mention the possibility of an heir.<br>
<br>Philip's relationship with England in the last year of his reign was conducted at second hand. The nobles he had pensioned before his first arrival, possibly with the intention that they should form the nucleus of a &#145;king's party&#146;, were now reduced to complaining of arrears of payment. In February 1558 the count of Feria was sent to London. The mission of the king's close friend was ostensibly to congratulate the queen on her pregnancy, but his real task was to maintain English support for Philip's French war. Again the recruitment of English sappers was high on the king's list of priorities. Feria found few allies, even among the king's former allies, Paget and Pembroke, who blocked efforts to reinvigorate England's war effort. Lord Clinton was consulted but showed no enthusiasm. Naval operations round the coast of Brittany achieved modest success, soon reversed. The man in whom Philip had reposed most confidence, Cardinal Pole, was said by Feria to be quite moribund.<br>
<br>King Philip now concentrated on achieving a smooth transfer of power to Princess Elizabeth. The marriage settlement had stated that his prerogatives would lapse if Mary died childless (though it is noteworthy that in 1557 he had drawn up a will bequeathing to Don Carlos all his patrimonial realms, including the Netherlands, in clear defiance of another part of the settlement). News that the queen's death could not be long delayed obliged Feria to return to England in October 1558. There was a forlorn hope that Elizabeth could still be married as a royal princess while the queen lived. But Mary was dying, and Feria visited Elizabeth to express Philip's hope that the amity would continue between Spain and the Tudor dominions. Relations between the king and his half-sister through marriage had been respectful though never cordial. The queen-in-waiting reminded the envoy that she would always be grateful to Philip, principally because &#145;when she was in prison [the king] had shown her favour and helped to obtain her release&#146;  (Rodr&iacute;quez-Salgado and Adams, 330). The suggestion that she should reconsider marriage to the duke of Savoy was dismissed with disdain. To the suggestion that she might marry Philip, floated either just before or shortly after Mary's death, Elizabeth gave an answer-answerless. Yet when she learned in April 1559 that Philip's peace negotiators with the French were already proposing a marriage alliance with Elisabeth de Valois without waiting for her own formal refusal, the English queen could not resist saying that the erstwhile king &#145;could not have been much in love with her, since he did not have the patience to wait four months&#146;  (Kamen, 72). But his fears that the French-backed Mary, queen of Scots, might take the English throne kept Philip well disposed towards Elizabeth, at least for some years, and he recoiled from suggestions, put forward by Cardinal Granvelle among others, that he should invade England from the Netherlands and restore Catholicism by force.<h2>
<a name="Postscript"></a>Postscript</h2>In February 1570 Philip wrote concerning the pope, &#145;that I could give him better information and advice on that kingdom, and on its affairs and people, than anyone else&#146;  (Parker). He was incensed that Pius V could excommunicate Elizabeth and call for her deposition without consulting him first. Philip's time as king of England made a profound impression on him. He had seen at first hand the lack of reverence shown by heretics towards royal as well as divine authority. He became convinced that England was a dangerous and unstable country that was best left alone. Mary died on 17 November 1558 and in the decade after her death he struggled to maintain amicable relations with Elizabeth. Unfortunately Spanish intervention in the Netherlands, and the activities of English corsairs in the New World, made an ideological and military struggle with protestant England unavoidable. By 1571 he was prepared to commit himself to the Ridolfi plot and Elizabeth's overthrow (though not her assassination) in favour of Mary Stuart. The failure of the Invincible Armada of 1588 did nothing to stop him from supporting a variety of military and naval operations against England and in Ireland, culminating in 1597 in a second armada, which, however, came to grief like the first. Two years earlier a book attributed to Robert Persons, <span class="italic">A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crowne of Ingland</span>, had argued for the claims of Philip's daughter Isabella, on the grounds of her father's descent from John of Gaunt. In hindsight, Philip's identification with the struggle against his former sister-in-law is the principal reason why his time as king of England has not made a stronger impression upon the historical imagination. But he too was prepared to erase the memory of his years as England's king. When his statue was commissioned for a place above the high altar in his monastic church of the Escorial, it represented him kneeling alongside his wives as a supplicant before God. His first wife appeared, as did his third, Elisabeth de Valois (<i>d</i>. 1568) and fourth, Anna of Austria (<i>d</i>. 1580). But Mary Tudor was omitted. And late in 1558, when news of the queen's death had reached him as he was heading for Brussels to mourn his father, Philip himself informed his sister in Spain of the queen's death, noting only that &#145;my wife is dead. May God have received her into his glory. I felt a reasonable regret for her death&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554&#150;8</i>, 440). Philip II of Spain, as by then he had long been, died in the Escorial after an agonizing illness at dawn on 13 September 1598. He was buried in the Escorial on the next day.<br>
