<span class="headword">Ogilvy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gore]</span>,  Mabell Frances Elizabeth</span>, countess of Airlie  (1866&#150;1956), <span class="occ">courtier and literary editor</span>, was born in Charles Street, London, on 10 March 1866, the eldest of the four children of Arthur Gore (1839&#150;1901), who was at that time Lord Sudley and who succeeded as fifth earl of Arran in 1884, and his first wife, Edith Elizabeth Henrietta Jocelyn (<i>c</i>.1844&#150;1871), daughter of Robert, Viscount Jocelyn. Her mother died when she was four, and she was brought up by her dour widowed grandmother, Frances, Lady Jocelyn, who was the daughter of Lady Palmerston and a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Victoria. Visits to the duchess of Teck at White Lodge in Richmond Park, where Mabell met the duchess's daughter, Princess May (the future Queen Mary), were among the few events that lifted the enforced gloom of the children's childhood. Mabell and her two sisters received a restricted education from governesses.<br>
<br>On 19 January 1886 Lady Mabell Gore married an active army officer, David William Stanley Ogilvy, sixth or twelfth earl of Airlie (1856&#150;1900)&#151;the number is confused because of an eighteenth-century attainder&#151;at St George's, Hanover Square. Despite being in love, she found it difficult to adapt to the submissive role required of young wives, and to cope with her six pregnancies, which produced three daughters and then three sons. Neither domesticated nor maternal by nature, Lady Airlie enjoyed army life, and her relationship with her husband deepened as she involved herself in his world. He went to South Africa with his regiment on the outbreak of the South African War, and on 11 June 1900 he was killed in action at Diamond Hill, Transvaal. Lady Airlie threw herself into managing Cortachy, the Airlie estate in Forfarshire, on behalf of her six-year-old son. In 1902 her old friend the princess of Wales (as Princess May had become) offered her the position of lady-in-waiting, and, after some hesitation, she accepted.<br>
<br>Thus began a fifty-year association between the two women. Lady Airlie offered a perceptive analysis of the relationships between Queen Mary, George V, and their children in her memoirs, and supported the queen through both world wars, the king's death, and the abdication of Edward VIII. She watched three generations of the royal family from close quarters, and encouraged the engagement of the future George VI to Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, whom she had known from their childhoods. In 1953 Elizabeth II recognized her long service by investing her with the GCVO. Lady Airlie was valued at court for her wisdom and her lively conversation. She became more attractive in maturity and enjoyed the company and conversation of men, but she did not remarry, maintaining that only her firm conviction that she would be reunited with her husband after death enabled her to enjoy life without him.<br>
<br>Away from court Mabell Ogilvy's priority was her family. Her working day began at four each morning, but she was always available to her children, whom she encouraged to be active and independent. She supported the Red Cross, and served for many years on the board of Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service. The First World War cut a swathe through her family: a son-in-law was killed in action in 1915, then her youngest son in 1917, and her third daughter was killed while exercising army horses in 1918.<br>
<br>When her eldest son married in 1917, Lady Airlie moved from Cortachy Castle to Airlie Castle, near Kirriemuir, where she began to edit family letters for publication. <span class="italic">In Whig Society, 1775&#150;1818</span> (1921) and <span class="italic">Lady Palmerston and her Times</span> (1922) were based on the papers of her great-grandmother, and <span class="italic">With the Guards We Shall Go</span> (1933) followed a great-uncle through the Crimean War. Her volumes remain a fascinating source, although her editing skills, unsurprisingly, do not meet exacting modern scholarly standards. In later life she wrote <span class="italic">The Red Cross in Angus</span> (1950) and began work on her memoirs, but did not complete them. They were discovered after her death by Jennifer Ellis, who edited them for publication as <span class="italic">Thatched with Gold</span> (1962).<br>
<br>Famously outspoken, Mabell Ogilvy defied fashion: &#145;With her striking appearance, with masses of white hair piled up, usually beneath a large picture hat, she could easily have been the subject of a portrait by Gainsborough, and she rarely deserted that old and elaborate fashion&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). But she adapted gracefully to a changing world. As early as the 1890s she had written a pamphlet advocating improvements in women's education and employment, and, when asked in the 1930s if the admission of a working-class woman to the Queen Alexandra nurses would lower the prestige of the service, her response was characteristically blunt: &#145;stuff and nonsense&#146;  (Airlie, 193). All forms of suffering moved her, and in her late eighties she was still looking for ways to help disabled former servicemen. The death of Queen Mary in 1953 was a blow, and in 1955 heavy taxation, the rising cost of living, and shortage of servants forced her to leave Airlie Castle. Declining to impose on her children, she clung to her independence, taking up residence at 129 Bayswater Road, Paddington. Even this reverse did not break her effervescent spirit, and on her ninetieth birthday her daughter found her dancing a jig. Lady Airlie died there a few weeks later, on 7 April 1956. The Airlie family maintained and extended the close relationship with the royal family established by Mabell Ogilvy: her eldest son David served as lord chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, while his second son, Angus, married Princess Alexandra, daughter of the duke of Kent.<br>
