<span class="headword">Howe, Sir  Assheton Gore  Curzon-</span>  (1850&#150;1911), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born at Gopsall, Leicestershire, on 10 August 1850, was the ninth son of Richard William Penn Howe, first Earl Howe of the second creation (1796&#150;1870), being the second son of his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 23 July 1877), second daughter of Admiral Sir John Gore. He was a great-grandson of Richard Howe, first Earl Howe, the great admiral, whose daughter and heir, Sophia Charlotte, Baroness Howe, married Penn, eldest son of Assheton Curzon, first Viscount Curzon. Curzon-Howe entered the navy on board the <i>Britannia</i> in December 1863, and from 1868 to 1871 served in the frigate <i>Galatea</i>, captain the duke of Edinburgh, which went round the world during that commission. He was promoted sub-lieutenant on 18 March 1870, and served on the <i>Bellerophon</i> in the channel squadron. His commission as lieutenant was dated 18 September 1872, and in November 1873 he was appointed to the sloop <i>Eclipse</i> on the North American station. A year later he was transferred to the <i>Bellerophon</i>, flagship on the same station, and in February 1876 was appointed to the <i>Sultan</i> in the Mediterranean, commanded by the duke of Edinburgh, whom two years later he followed into the <i>Black Prince</i>.<br>
<br>In July 1879 the <i>Bacchante</i> was commissioned by Captain Lord Charles Scott for a cruise round the world, and to give Albert Edward, duke of Clarence, and the prince of Wales, afterwards King George V, their sea training as cadets. Curzon-Howe was chosen to be her first lieutenant, and was directly responsible for the seamanship instruction of the princes. On the return of the ship to England he was promoted commander on 31 August 1882.<br>
<br>In January 1883 Curzon-Howe became executive officer of the <i>Sultan</i> in the channel squadron, and two years later was appointed in the same capacity to the <i>Raleigh</i>, flagship on the Cape station. In July 1886 he was given the command of the royal yacht <i>Osborne</i>, from which on 6 January 1888 he was promoted captain. Shortly afterwards Curzon-Howe commissioned the <i>Boadicea</i> for the East India station, where, in August 1888, she relieved the <i>Bacchante</i> as flagship of Sir Edmund Fremantle. As flag captain and chief of the staff he took part in the Vitu (Witu, Kenya) expedition of October 1890, for which he received the CB. Curzon-Howe married on 25 February 1892 Alice Ann (<i>d</i>. 5 Nov 1948), eldest daughter of General Sir John Cowell PC KCB, master of her majesty's household. They had two sons and three daughters. Their eldest daughter, Victoria Alexandrina, to whom Queen Victoria was godmother, died at Malta on 3 February 1910.<br>
<br>From August 1891 he served for a year at the Admiralty as assistant director of naval intelligence, and then went to the North American station in command of the <i>Cleopatra</i>, and as commodore during the Newfoundland fishing season. In this ship he was present at Bluefields, Nicaragua, during the disturbances of 1894, and by his prompt action in landing a party of seamen and marines averted a civil war. In January 1896 he was created CMG for his services in Newfoundland, and in the same month became flag captain to Rear-Admiral A. T. Dale in the <i>Revenge</i>, flagship of the flying squadron which was put in commission shortly after the publication in January 1896 of the Kaiser's telegram to Kruger; this congratulated Kruger on the defeat of the Jameson raid, a gesture perceived by the British as a hostile intervention in their imperial affairs. In April 1897 he was appointed to command the training ship <i>Britannia</i> at Dartmouth, and afterwards, from February 1900, he commanded the battleship <i>Ocean</i> on the China station. In July 1899 Curzon-Howe was appointed an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria, and held this post until promoted to flag rank on 23 July 1901.<br>
<br>In June 1902 he hoisted his flag in the <i>Magnificent</i> as second in command in the channel, and from that time his employment was practically continuous. In June 1903 he became second in command on the China station with his flag in the <i>Albion</i>. On 30 June 1905 he was appointed KCB, and on 12 September he was promoted vice-admiral. In the December following he returned to the Channel Fleet, now greatly enlarged, as second in command, with his flag on board the <i>Caesar</i>. In February 1907 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet, whence in November 1908 he was transferred in the same capacity, but with acting rank as admiral, to the Mediterranean, his flagship during both commands being the <i>Exmouth</i>. The disastrous earthquake at Messina in December 1908 called the commander-in-chief with part of his squadron to aid in the relief work, and the crisis which accompanied the revolution in Turkey made the Mediterranean for the time the centre of concern. On 2 January 1909 he was advanced to admiral, and in July received the GCVO. He was relieved in April 1910, and immediately hoisted his flag on the <i>Victory</i> as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth.<br>
<br>Curzon-Howe died suddenly at Admiralty House, Portsmouth, on 1 March 1911 and was buried with naval honours at Highcliffe, near Christchurch. A memorial tablet was placed in Portsmouth Dockyard church. &#145;Holding strong opinions on some points, he constantly stood aloof from all controversies of public character. Few flag-officers who have held such important appointments have ever been so little in the public eye as he&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). This reflected a solid career, undistinguished by any particular contribution.<br>
