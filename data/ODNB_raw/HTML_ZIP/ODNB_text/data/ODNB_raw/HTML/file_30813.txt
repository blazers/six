<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bernal,  (John) Desmond</span>  (1901&#150;1971), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 10 May 1901 at Brookswatson, Nenagh, co. Tipperary, eldest of the three sons and two daughters of Samuel George Bernal, a farmer of Limerick, and his wife, Elizabeth Miller, elder daughter of the Presbyterian minister in San Jos&eacute;, California. The Bernal family can be traced back to Sephardic Jews in sixteenth-century Spain. Among their descendants in the nineteenth century several flourished in England, but Bernal's grandfather lived in Ireland. Bernal's father, Samuel, had run away to sea and farmed sheep in Australia before he settled to farming in Ireland.<h2>
<a name="Educationandpoliticalsympathies"></a>Education and political sympathies</h2>There seems to have been little in the way of a bond between father and son, but a rewarding companionship between Elizabeth Bernal and her first-born. His mother was described by C. P. Snow as literary and cultivated (she attended lectures at Stanford University and the Sorbonne, and contributed articles to the <span class="italic">San Francisco Argonaut</span>), and it was her care for his education which meant that at the age of ten he was sent, with his brother Kevin, to Hodder, the preparatory school for Stonyhurst College. However, both boys were miserable at Stonyhurst, and their mother moved them to Bedford School, where some science was taught. Emmanuel College, Cambridge, awarded Bernal a scholarship in mathematics in 1919, so it was to Cambridge he went, and when he completed his undergraduate courses in 1923 he had been educated in England for twelve years. For the rest of his life he spoke with the voice of an educated member of the upper class.<br>
<br>Bernal brought with him to Cambridge, alongside his passion for science, a deep concern for the state of Ireland and a strong attachment to Catholicism which he viewed positively as a powerful hindrance to the Anglicization of his home country. Long before&#151;he claimed at the age of ten&#151;he had come to the conclusion that the answer to Ireland's problems lay with science. Living in both countries as a boy he had been made painfully aware of the striking contrast between the poverty of agricultural Ireland and the growing wealth of industrial England. Ireland, he believed, needed to attain economic as well as political independence from Great Britain. His enthusiasm for science was not, therefore, solely that of curiosity but more importantly out of concern for its wealth-giving applications. In this he proved steadfast, despite the revelations of the atom's dread powers. Among fellow students he soon became something of a legend&#151;his encyclopaedic knowledge and his photographic memory, his articulate and persuasive speech, and his passion for what he held dear earned him the nickname Sage. C. P. Snow described his &#145;shock of fairish hair gone wild&#146; and &#145;beautiful, humorous, hazel eyes&#146;  (Snow, 19). He married (Agnes) Eileen (1898&#150;1990), a former student of Newnham College and the daughter of Dr William Carr Sprague, on 21 June 1922, having just reached his majority, but not his graduation. In any event, his marriage did not cramp his amorous nature. In addition to his two sons, Michael and Egan, with his wife, he had Martin with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94500/', "Margaret Gardiner (1904&#150;2005)")</script> and (Susanna) Jane with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39546/', "Margot Heinemann (1913&#150;1992)")</script>.<br>
<br>The intellectual qualities that Bernal displayed as an undergraduate, one would have thought, would have endeared him to his college and university, but there were problems. His young Cambridge friends had influenced him in the direction of Marxism. The Irish national foundation of his political concern, they considered, was too narrow. H. D. Dickinson introduced him to the socialist society. His communist friend Allen Hutt lent him Marx's works. Bernal was soon converted and his faith in the Roman Catholic church weakened. Already in his pioneer work <span class="italic">The Social Function of Science</span> (1937) his admiration for Marx's writings and for the organization of science in the Soviet Union is evident. Twenty years later he was to sum up his view of Marx in the little work <span class="italic">Marx and Science</span> (1957). By that time he could look back on the Second World War as &#145;another world catastrophe brought about by the insane greed and violence of a decaying capitalism&#146;  (J. D. Bernal, <span class="italic">Marx and Science</span>, 42). On the bright side, though, both in China and in the &#145;People's Democracies of Europe&#146;, he declared, &#145;the age-old role of the landlords is over and the natural talents of the people can find expression&#146;. With pride and confidence he pointed to the 800 million of them now living under socialism. The Soviet intervention in Hungary was four years away, but Lysenko's destruction of Russian genetics had begun in the 1930s and proved to be a serious embarrassment to socialist scientists in Britain. In due course J. B. S. Haldane resigned from the Communist Party chiefly because of it, but in 1939 Bernal had attributed the controversy to the fact that Soviet science as it grew was only just finding out its philosophy, a process which he described as &#145;lively and at times almost violent&#146;  (J. D. Bernal, <span class="italic">The Social Function of Science</span>, 1939, 231, 237). Reports of the matter had been greatly exaggerated outside the Soviet Union, he thought, and it was misleading to describe the controversy as a revival of the old Weismann&#150;Lamarck debate. Over the years Bernal became more critical, and in 1968 he was prepared to admit that Lysenko had ignored contemporary biology&#151;Bernal had by then visited Lysenko and seen his work. But it was modern molecular biology and the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA that changed Bernal's mind. These developments were to him &#145;more materialistic and hence more Marxist than Lysenko's views&#146;  (J. D. Bernal, &#145;The material theory of life&#146;, <span class="italic">Labour Monthly</span>, 50, 1968, 326).<br>
<br>Judged by the natural sciences tripos examinations results Bernal did not excel, perhaps due to the extent of his interests outside the formal curriculum, and to his discovery of a passion for crystallography. Taught this subject by Arthur Hutchinson, Bernal decided to derive the 230 space groups using Hamiltonian quaternions. This enormous task took his attention away from the physics of Professor Rutherford, and a second class in the part two physics final examination was the result&#151;a disappointment after his first in the part one in chemistry, geology, and mineralogy, but the work on the space groups deeply impressed Hutchinson. Through his recommendation Bernal was offered a position at the Davy&#150;Faraday Laboratory at the Royal Institution in London, directed by Sir William Bragg.<h2>
<a name="Researchincrystallography"></a>Research in crystallography</h2>By natural inclination Bernal was a theoretician rather than an experimentalist, but Sir William, who with his son Lawrence had worked out the structure of diamond in 1913, wanted the structure of graphite determined. These two forms of carbon could be considered as prototypes for the dimensions of the carbon-carbon bond in aliphatic and aromatic compounds respectively. Introduced to the exact method of measuring diffraction intensities using the X-ray spectrometer, Bernal recoiled at the patience required&#151;a whole day to measure only two reflections! The alternative was to use photographic film, not so accurate but much quicker. The snag was that he had to assemble his equipment himself from bits and pieces. Doggedly he persisted and the structure came out with a carbon-carbon distance of 1.42 &Aring; in contrast to the distance for diamond of 1.54 &Aring;. This work done, Bernal turned to methods of analysis. He popularized Paul Ewald's conception of the reciprocal lattice, gave a systematic account of rotation methods, and in 1926 published the very useful charts he had laboriously calculated for plotting the layer lines of diffraction patterns. The distances between these lines represent the reciprocal of distances separating scattering points in the crystal lattice. To make the photographic method easy to use he designed equipment that was marketed by a Cambridge company as the X-ray photogoniometer. Bernal also worked on the structure of metal alloys while at the Royal Institution&#151;a subject with obvious industrial applications.<br>
<br>In 1927 Bernal returned to Cambridge on his appointment to the revived lectureship in structural crystallography. He was to remain there until 1938, becoming assistant director of research in 1935. Then he moved to the chair of physics, subsequently crystallography, at Birkbeck College, London, retiring in 1968. If his years at the Royal Institution were the most exciting and formative of his scientific life, the decade he spent in Cambridge was the most significant for our assessment of his contribution to science, for it was then that the foundations were laid for the tradition of research on the structure of biologically important compounds which we associate with Cambridge, where he made firm friends with several biochemists. There followed a productive collaboration with the outstanding experimentalist Dorothy Crowfoot (subsequently Hodgkin) and Isidore Fankuchen. Between 1931 and 1937 Bernal published his preliminary study of the crystallography of amino acids and oligopeptides, the structure of the carbon skeleton of sterols, the structure of water, and the first description of the diffraction patterns of protein crystals using the trick of bathing the crystals in their mother liquor; the latter two achievements gave the first glimpse of the world of molecular structure that underlies living things. The hope of creating a molecular account of the organic basis of life was born here.<br>
<br>For a number of reasons Bernal's plans for crystallography at Birkbeck College did not enjoy quite the same success. His substantial contributions to civil defence, Bomber Command and combined operations, during the war won him the medal of Freedom (with palms) from the United States but inevitably took him away from the college. Then, as the cold war began, he became a globe-trotter&#151;working indefatigably for world peace and for the socialist cause. The fact that he found time to write his ambitious and extensive 1000-page <span class="italic">Science in History</span> (1954), although greatly aided by Francis Aprahamian and Anita Rimmel, suggests that his enthusiasms now lay outside the laboratory, that the man who had been torn away from his research by the war could not again recover the urge and the patience he once showed for the structural analysis of the proteins. Having shipped off his equipment with Fankuchen to America when hostilities began, he lived to mourn the loss of his promising researches of the inter-war years. When the double helical structure of DNA was discovered his regret at not being in the story was evident, but he could take pride in the contribution of his department, for it was Sven Furberg who came from Norway in 1947 to work at Birkbeck, there establishing the three-dimensional structure of cytidine (pyrimidine plus sugar)&#151;essential information for the solving of the structure of DNA.<br>
<br>Also in 1947 Francis Crick visited Bernal in his quest for a research position in biology, followed two years later by an enquiry from Rosalind Franklin for the same purpose. Bernal had by this time a grant from the Nuffield Foundation, and the Medical Research Council's secretary, Sir Edward Mellanby, assured Crick that an application supported by Bernal would be accepted automatically, but Bernal was out of the country. In the meantime the biophysicist A. V. Hill urged Crick to consider Cambridge. Likewise the physical chemist Charles Coulson advised Franklin to apply to King's College rather than Birkbeck. After the DNA research was completed she did move to Birkbeck and carry out her fine researches into viral RNA. It seems, therefore, that it was neither the lack of funds nor Bernal's politics that prevented him from re-establishing his pre-eminent place in the field of biomolecular structure after the war, but the opinion formed about his commitment to research on a day-to-day basis. Was he not a founder member of the World Federation of Scientific Workers and the World Peace Council? Snow described him at this stage as &#145;in continuous motion, scurrying from Birkbeck, the most recent scientific paper being corrected in the car to London airport, off to one of the socialist capitals, Moscow, Warsaw, Bucharest, or Peking&#146;  (C. P. Snow, &#145;John Desmond Bernal&#146;, <span class="italic">DSB</span>, 15, Suppl., 1978, 19).<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>To view Bernal's achievement by comparing it with the success of 1950s molecular biology, however, fails to reveal Bernal's vision of biomolecular structure. First it is not clear that he was interested in genetics, or in the nucleic acids as the genetic material. Had he not, in support of Lysenko, claimed that genetics had inherent weaknesses due to its design to serve capitalist aims? Second, he was fascinated by the mystery of the origin of life, an interest continued over many years, and leading to his full-length study <span class="italic">The Origin of Life</span> (1967). This subject raised the question of the level of organization at which life could be said to emerge. He envisioned a series of levels from the molecular to the organismic, and his focus was on organization at the <i>inter</i>-molecular level of colloids, membranes, and Aleksandr I. Oparin's coascervates. Thus his pioneer study with Fankuchen of tobacco mosaic virus crystals was directed chiefly to the behaviour of the molecules at varying degrees of hydration, rather than to the internal structure of the molecules themselves. This was very understandable at the time: in the absence of the electron microscope the interpretation of the diffraction intensities corresponding to distances between molecules was the only way to bridge the gap between the molecular and the cytological structures. Hence, on his return from war work to Birkbeck College he wrote to Fankuchen describing his hopes and explaining that &#145;the main idea is to link up the long-range forces with the biological systems&#146;  (Olby, 262).<br>
<br>Additionally, the data of the diffraction patterns of the tobacco mosaic virus were not those of a single crystal to which the standard methods of interpretation could be readily applied. They were, it later turned out, the transforms of the molecules rather than of the crystal lattice. This explains why Bernal and Fankuchen experienced such difficulty in establishing the features of the unit cell. Nor was the pattern blessed with numerous spots, at least not enough of them to justify the use of the standard methods of analysis which Bernal preferred. As he was later to remark (1968):<blockquote>The picture of a helical structure contains far fewer spots than does that of a regular three-dimensional crystalline structure, and thus far less detailed information on atomic positions, but it is easier to interpret roughly and therefore gives a good clue to the whole. (Bernal, &#145;Material theory&#146;, 324)</blockquote>He added that it may appear &#145;paradoxical that the more information-carrying methods should be deemed the less useful to examine a really complex molecule&#146;. Here he implied, it seems, that as far as methods of analysis for the nucleic acids were concerned, he had &#145;backed the wrong horse&#146;.<br>
<br>The theme running through Bernal's popular writing is one of developing science in the service of all mankind. Like Marx, Bernal saw science as part of the productive forces, not an abstract body of idealistic thought. Time was when science was the occupation of the curious supported by the wealthy. Now, he explained, it has become &#145;an industry supported by large monopolies and by the State&#146;  (Bernal, &#145;Material theory&#146;, xiii). The problem for Bernal was to set out the conditions under which science can be most successfully pursued and most advantageously deployed for the benefit of all. In <span class="italic">The Social Function of Science</span>&#151;a truly prophetic work&#151;he stressed the need for organized and planned research, for co-operation in research, for adequate documentation, and for the scientific study of scientific activity&#151;what was to become the &#145;science of science&#146;. Bernal wrote the book because he resented the inefficiency and frustration of scientific research on the one hand, and its diversion to base ends on the other. Later he was to turn to the history of science, for only with that knowledge, he claimed, could we hope to understand the significance of the institution of science and its relation to society. In 1937 he remarked that existing histories of science &#145;are little more than pious records of great men and their works&#146;  (Bernal, <span class="italic">Social Function</span>, 11). What is history, he asked, but the progressive unfolding of the productive relation between man and nature? It was therefore fitting that he should take his great work <span class="italic">Science in History</span> (1954) up to the post-war period. Viewed from the present Bernal's unfailing optimism for nuclear power, world energy supplies, antibiotics, synthetic fibres, massive irrigation to make the deserts bloom, and changing the course of rivers to suit man's needs, seems outdated and na&iuml;ve. Yes, he admitted, agriculture has produced devastation, but only because of the &#145;predatory nature of capitalism&#146;  (Bernal, <span class="italic">Science in History</span>, vol. 3, 964). In truth, Bernal remained to the end a passionate visionary. He was elected to fellowship of the Royal Society in 1937, and was the Society's royal medallist in 1945. In 1953 he received the Lenin prize for peace, in 1965 an honorary fellowship of his Cambridge college, and in 1969 fellowship of Birkbeck College. He began to suffer from health problems in 1951. The severe stroke he suffered in 1963 increasingly limited his activities and after several further strokes he died on 15 September 1971 and was buried in London.<br>
