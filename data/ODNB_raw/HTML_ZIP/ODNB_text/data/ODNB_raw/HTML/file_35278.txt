<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Ignatius John</span>, Baron Shandon  (1857&#150;1930), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was born in Cork on 31 July 1857, the ninth child and youngest son of Mark Joseph O'Brien, merchant, and his wife, Jane, daughter of William Dunne, of Cork. He was educated at the Vincentian school, Cork, and then privately; at the age of sixteen he entered the Catholic University of Ireland, Dublin, an institution which had no power to award recognized degrees. He left after only two years, because of financial difficulties at home, and had to earn his own living immediately. He worked first as junior reporter on <span class="italic">Saunders' Newsletter</span>, a Dublin Conservative daily newspaper, and then for <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, while studying for the bar in his free time.<br>
<br>O'Brien was called to the bar in 1881, but he continued to have to support himself through his freelance journalism and was very slow to build up a practice. In his first year at the bar he made only 6 guineas and in his second only 29; in his third year he began to acquire a small practice on the Munster circuit. Despairing of any real success, he was about to emigrate to New South Wales when he unexpectedly won public acclaim. In 1887 the parish priest of Youghal, Canon Keller, had been questioned in the bankruptcy court as a witness to the financial circumstances of some of his parishioners. Since the priest had acquired his knowledge in his capacity as confessor, and so was bound to silence according to Catholic canon law, he refused to give evidence, and was sent to prison for unsatisfactory answering. T. M. Healy, supported by the Land League, suggested that O'Brien should bring a motion of habeas corpus to secure Canon Keller's release. Although unsuccessful in the court of Queen's Bench, O'Brien secured an order of release from the Court of Appeal, and became a popular Irish Catholic hero, which helped him to build up a good practice. On 11 February 1886 O'Brien had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of John Talbot Scallan, a well-known Dublin solicitor. O'Brien soon gave up circuit business and devoted himself to cases in Chancery and bankruptcy; before long he was a leading authority in bankruptcy law, and in 1899 he finally took silk.<br>
<br>Once his career was launched, O'Brien's professional success was from 1906 ensured by the steady rise of the Liberal Party, which reflected his own political preferences. Since there were very few eminent Liberals in the Irish bar, he helped his party at elections, though he did not stand as a candidate himself. In 1907 he became a bencher of King's Inns, and in 1910 he was promoted to the position of serjeant-at-law. In 1911 he was appointed solicitor-general for Ireland and in 1912 he became attorney-general and was admitted a privy councillor for Ireland. In 1913 the offices of lord chancellor and of lord chief justice of Ireland became vacant at the same time, and as attorney-general O'Brien sought for and obtained the chancellorship.<br>
<br>The same political climate which enabled O'Brien to rise in his profession also made his tenure of office rather insecure at times, as Conservative English politicians attempted to oust him from office. When the first coalition government was formed in 1915 he was on the verge of being superseded in favour of the unionist James Henry Mussen Campbell, a former solicitor-general and attorney-general for Ireland, but the government feared American and Irish nationalist opinion too much to appoint such a staunch and uncompromising unionist as Campbell. In the end, an outcry was averted and O'Brien kept his position. On 15 January 1916 he was created a baronet, and in 1917, when his rival Sir James Campbell was made lord chief justice, his position seemed safe. However, in 1918 Conservative opinion again seemed to be in the ascendant and O'Brien was dismissed as lord chancellor in favour of Campbell, being offered consolation in the form of a peerage in July 1918. He accepted, choosing the title of Baron Shandon after the church bells described in the poem &#145;The Shandon Bells&#146; by Father Prout (Francis Sylvester Mahony). Horrified and exasperated by the violence perpetrated and justified by Sinn F&eacute;in, who had raided his own house, he left Ireland for good; he sold his Irish property at Ardtona, near Dublin, and went to live at St Lawrence on the Isle of Wight. He also kept a house at 12 Newton Court, Church Street, Kensington, London. He was called to the English bar by the Middle Temple in 1923.<br>
<br>Initially sceptical about the House of Lords, Lord Shandon found the peers unexpectedly agreeable and even became reconciled to the hereditary system. He took an active part in negotiations and debate over the abortive <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span> (1920), but afterwards became less voluble, speaking only on questions which directly affected Ireland, or on matters in which he had legal expertise. His last speech was delivered in 1927, on the <span class="roman">Law of Libel Amendment Bill</span>, which he opposed. He died at his London home on 10 September 1930; since he had no children, the peerage became extinct on his death.<br>
<br>Unlikely to be remembered as a truly great advocate, judge, or statesman, Shandon worked hard all his life and will be remembered as a competent judge. During the troubled times when he was in office, he exercised a moderating influence over the political activists of his day. His wish was for home rule in Ireland without severing completely the imperial tie with Britain. However, his views were overborne by those of his more vociferous political opponents.<br>
