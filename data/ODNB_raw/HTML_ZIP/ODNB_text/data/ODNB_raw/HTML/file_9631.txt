<span class="headword">FitzRoy, Lord  Charles</span>  (1764&#150;1829), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 17 July 1764, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9628/', "Augustus Henry FitzRoy, third duke of Grafton (1735&#150;1811)")</script>, and his first wife, Anne, daughter of Henry Liddell, Baron Ravensworth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/88658/', "Fitzpatrick, Anne, countess of Upper Ossory (1737/&#150;1804)")</script>]. His parents divorced in 1769. He was educated at Harrow School (1774&#150;6), Mr Newcombe's school, Hackney, Middlesex (1776), and Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated in 1782, MA 1784). After entering the army as an ensign in 1782 he was appointed captain of the 3rd foot guards in 1787, and in 1788 equerry to the duke of York, under whom he served in the Flanders campaign of 1793&#150;4. FitzRoy was present at the siege of Valenciennes.<br>
<br>In 1795 FitzRoy was made aide-de-camp to the king with the rank of colonel; he became a major-general in 1798, served on the Irish staff from February 1798 to April 1799, and was then on the home staff until 1809, with the exception of the peaceful interlude of 1802. He also commanded the garrison at Ipswich. He was colonel-commandant of a battalion of the 60th foot in 1804&#150;5 and colonel of the 48th foot from 1805 until his death. He became a lieutenant-general in January 1805, and a general on 4 January 1814. On 20 June 1795 FitzRoy married Frances (<i>d</i>. 9 Aug 1797), the daughter of Edward Miller Mundy, who had been MP for Derbyshire; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9632/', "Charles Augustus FitzRoy")</script>. His second marriage, on 10 March 1799, was to Lady Frances Anne Stewart (<i>d</i>. 9 Feb 1810), eldest daughter of Robert Stewart, first marquess of Londonderry; they had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9639/', "Robert FitzRoy")</script> and George, and one daughter.<br>
<br>FitzRoy was MP for Bury St Edmunds between 1787 and 1796, and again from 1802 to 1818, during which time he did not speak in the house. He supported Pitt, and favoured abolition of the slave trade and Roman Catholic emancipation. By 1810 he was considered an adherent of the whigs. During the last twenty years of his life he lived mainly at his seat at Wicken, Northamptonshire, where he endeared himself to the poor by many acts of charity. He died at his house in Berkeley Square, London, on 20 December 1829, and was buried at Wicken on 30 December.<br>
