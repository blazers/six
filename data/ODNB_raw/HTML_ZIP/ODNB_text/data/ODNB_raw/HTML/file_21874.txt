<span class="headword">Pennington,  James</span>  (1777&#150;1862), <span class="occ">writer on currency and banking</span>, born at Kendal, Westmorland, on 23 February 1777, was the son of William Pennington, a bookseller, and his wife, Agnes Wilson. Educated first at Kendal grammar school, he afterwards became a pupil of John Dalton (1766&#150;1844) of Manchester. Subsequently Pennington worked in business in London. In 1811 he married Mary Anne, eldest daughter of John Harris of Clapham; they had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>At the end of 1831 Pennington was appointed to investigate the accounts of the East India Company, but the appointment was cancelled when the administration changed. Thrown out of employment Pennington devoted himself to the study of currency and finance, and attracted the favourable notice of William Huskisson, David Ricardo, and Thomas Tooke. On Tooke's recommendation he joined the Political Economy Club in 1828; he also contributed appendices to Tooke's <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Grenville</span> (1829), and to his <span class="italic">History of Prices</span> (2, appx C). When, on the emancipation of slaves in 1833, it became necessary to regulate the currency of the West Indies, Pennington was employed for that purpose by the Treasury, and framed the measures which were adopted. In 1848 he published <span class="italic">The Currency of the British Colonies</span>, which was printed for official use, and which contains much detail of historical interest.<br>
<br>As early as 1827 Pennington had urged, in a paper submitted to Huskisson, the desirability of some restriction on the issue of notes by the Bank of England. He had further explained his views in a pamphlet addressed to Kirkman Finlay (1840). During the preparation of the <span class="roman">Bank Act</span> (1844) he was confidentially consulted by Sir Robert Peel. Though he accepted the principle of that legislation, he was not in entire agreement with Peel, and disapproved of the separation of the banking and issue departments of the Bank of England. From this time until his death he was frequently consulted by the government on currency and finance, on which he was regarded as a leading authority. He died on 23 March 1862 at his home in Clapham Common. His son Arthur Robert became canon of Lincoln and rector of Utterby, Louth.<br>
