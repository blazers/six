<span class="headword">Walsh,  John  Benn-</span>, first Baron Ormathwaite  (1798&#150;1881), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at Warfield Park, Berkshire, on 9 December 1798, was the only son of Sir John Benn-Walsh, baronet, of Warfield Park, Berkshire, and Ormathwaite, Cumberland. His father was the son of William Benn of Moor Row, Cumberland, a member of an old north-country family; he married, in 1778, Margaret [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/63563">Walsh,  Margaret  Benn-</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/63560">Fowke,  Joseph  (1716&#150;1800)</a>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63560/', "Joseph Fowke")</script> of Bexley, Kent, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph Walsh, governor of Fort St George. On 4 April 1795 he assumed the surname and arms of Walsh by royal licence, in compliance with the will of his wife's uncle, John Walsh (1726&#150;1795), son of Joseph Walsh. He was created a baronet on 14 June 1804, sat for Bletchingly in 1802&#150;6, and died on 7 June 1825.<br>
<br>Walsh was educated at Eton College, and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 3 December 1816. He entered parliament for the borough of Sudbury in 1830, and represented that constituency as a tory until December 1834. An energetic politician and an able writer, he published several pamphlets on parliamentary reform, the second of which, <span class="italic">Observations on the Ministerial Plan of Reform</span> (1831), Lord Ellenborough thought would secure him &#145;a good efficient place&#146;  (Aspinall, 77); but he had no seat when Peel regained office in 1834. In January 1835 he contested the county of Radnor, but was defeated by a small majority. After defeat at Poole in the general election of 1837, he was elected for Salisbury at a by-election in March 1838. He then moved, unopposed, to Radnorshire at a by-election in June 1840, holding the seat unopposed (except in 1841) until 1868. Despite his ability, he did not hold office, even in the three Derby&#150;Disraeli tory governments.<br>
<br>Walsh was JP and deputy lieutenant for Berkshire, and served as high sheriff of that county in 1823. Being lord of the manor of Trewerne in Radnorshire and the owner of over 12,000 acres there (his seat was Newcastle Court), he was also JP for that county and high sheriff in 1825; he was lord lieutenant and <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Radnorshire from 1842 to 1875. He was a staunch defender of Anglicanism in Wales. He married, on 8 November 1825, Jane (1803&#150;1877), youngest daughter of George Harry Grey, sixth earl of Stamford and Warrington. With her he had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In addition to his political pamphlets, Walsh wrote <span class="italic">Chapters of Contemporary History</span> (1836), <span class="italic">Political Back-Games</span> (1871), <span class="italic">Astronomy and Geology Compared</span> (1872), and <span class="italic">Lessons of the French Revolution, 1789&#150;1872</span> (1873). On 16 April 1868 Disraeli had him created Baron Ormathwaite of Ormathwaite. He died at his Berkshire seat, Warfield Park, on 3 February 1881 and was buried at Warfield.<br>
