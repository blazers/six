<span class="headword">Manby,  Charles</span>  (1804&#150;1884), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 4 February 1804, at West Cowes, Isle of Wight, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17917/', "Aaron Manby (1776&#150;1850)")</script>, engineer, and his wife Juliana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fewster. He received his early education at a Roman Catholic seminary, from where he was sent in 1814 to the semi-military college of St Servan at Rennes in Brittany. His uncle, Captain Joseph Manby, private secretary and aide-de-camp to the duke of Kent, had already obtained a commission for him, but the end of the Napoleonic wars caused him to change his plans. He joined his father at the Horseley ironworks, Tipton, in 1815 and assisted in building the first iron steamboat, the <i>Aaron Manby</i>. About 1823 Manby went to Paris to take charge of the gasworks established there by his father, and he subsequently superintended his father's foundry at Charenton. After a short stay at the Creusot ironworks, which his father had undertaken to reorganize, he was employed by the tobacco department of the French government, and he also received a commission in the French military engineers. In 1829 he returned to England and took the management of the Beaufort ironworks in south Wales. There he met his first wife, Ellen Jones, whom he married in 1830. After spending a short time at the Ebbw Vale ironworks and the Bristol ironworks, he established himself in London in 1835 as a civil engineer, specializing in the heating and ventilating of buildings. In 1838 he became connected with Sir John Ross's steamer service to India, which was soon absorbed by the Peninsular and Oriental Company.<br>
<br>In 1839 he was appointed secretary to the Institution of Civil Engineers, performing the duties of this office for seventeen years with conspicuous success, his wide range of social contacts being of great help in establishing the status of the institution. Upon his retirement in 1856 he was elected honorary secretary, in which capacity he continued to be heavily involved in institution activities until his death. From 1856 he was the London agent for Robert Stephenson &amp; Co., travelling widely in Europe to secure work for them.<br>
<br>In 1853 Manby was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and he received many foreign awards and honours. He was a member of the international commission which met in Paris to consider the feasibility of constructing the Suez Canal. His perfect command of the French language was of considerable service in maintaining a good understanding between the engineers' societies of London and Paris. In 1864 he helped to establish the engineer and railway volunteer staff corps. His interests ranged beyond the engineering world, and for many years he was involved in the management of the Adelphi and Haymarket theatres. His first wife predeceased him and in 1858 he married Harriet, daughter of Major Nicholas Willard of Eastbourne, and widow of W. C. Hood, formerly a partner in the publishing house of Whitaker &amp; Co. There were no children of either marriage, and towards the end of his life he lived with his stepson, Arthur Robert Hood, at The Grays, Eastbourne. He died at his London home, Ranelagh House, 10 Lower Grosvenor Place, on 31 July 1884.<br>
