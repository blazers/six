<span class="headword">Hopkins,  Charles</span>  (1671?&#150;1700), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, probably born in Dublin, was the elder son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13746/', "Rt Revd Ezekiel Hopkins (1634&#150;1690)")</script>, bishop of Derry, and his first wife, Alice (<i>bap</i>. 1645, <i>d</i>. 1681), the daughter of Samuel Moore and niece of Sir Thomas Vyner, a goldsmith. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13749/', "John Hopkins (b. 1675)")</script>, the writer. A number of eighteenth-century authorities state that Hopkins was born in Exeter, perhaps in 1664, but the well-documented career of his father, who left London and became the minister of St Mary Arches, Exeter, in 1666, and who accompanied John, Lord Robartes of Truro, to Ireland as the lord lieutenant's chaplain in 1669, makes this account difficult to sustain. On 7 July 1685, moreover, when his age was recorded as fourteen, Hopkins was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin. He continued his education at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he was admitted pensioner on 14 May 1687. He graduated BA in 1688/9.<br>
<br>Following the events of 1688, Hopkins returned to Ireland. Over his loyalties records again differ, but it is probable that he fought for the protestant cause. He subsequently settled in London, where he led a fashionably dissolute life. Although he was admitted to the Middle Temple on 17 August 1695, he moved in predominantly literary circles, counting among his acquaintance William Wycherley, William Congreve, and Thomas Southerne. Hopkins published <span class="italic">Epistolary Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1694), a collection of verses addressed to friends and patrons, including Charles Sackville, earl of Dorset, and Walter Moyle, and translations of Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, and the <span class="italic">Elegies</span> of Tibullus, which he dedicated to Anthony Hammond, the poet and pamphleteer. He further published <span class="italic">The History of Love. A Poem in a Letter to a Lady</span> (1695), dedicated to Isabella FitzRoy, duchess of Grafton, a selection of renderings from the <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, and <span class="italic">Heroides</span>, which attracted Dryden's favour and which was subsequently appended to <span class="italic">Ovid's Art of Love</span> (1709), a popular compendium of translations and paraphrases by Dryden, Congreve, Nahum Tate, and Arthur Maynwaring; <span class="italic">White-Hall, or, The Court of England</span> (Dublin, 1698), dedicated to Mary Butler, duchess of Ormond, an effusive but able Williamite panegyric which was reprinted in London the following year as <span class="italic">The Court-Prospect</span>, and which may have suggested itself to Alexander Pope during the composition of <span class="italic">Windsor-Forest</span> (1704&#150;13; published 1713); and <span class="italic">The Art of Love: in Two Books: Dedicated to the Ladies</span> (1700), a paraphrase of parts of <span class="italic">Ars amatoria</span>, not to be confused with <span class="italic">The History of Love</span>.<br>
<br>The anonymous prose tract <span class="italic">A Letter to A. H. Esq; Concerning the Stage</span> (1698), a sensible contribution to the dispute which had arisen from Jeremy Collier's views on the &#145;immorality&#146; of the English stage, has also been attributed to Hopkins (the initials have been thought to denote Anthony Hammond). He certainly enjoyed a parallel career as a playwright. <span class="italic">Pyrrhus King of Epirus</span> (published 1695), a tragedy&#151;this was his only dramatic genre&#151;appears to have been written by November 1693, but it is likely that it was first performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in August 1695, a month when the capital was thinly peopled, as the prologue, by Congreve, elaborates. <span class="italic">Neglected Virtue, or, The Unhappy Conquerour</span> was performed at Drury Lane to no greater success, probably in February 1696, and published anonymously that same year, under the supervision of Hildebrand Horden, who took the part of Artaban, a Parthian general. <span class="italic">Boadicea Queen of Britain</span> (published 1697) played to applause at Lincoln's Inn Fields, however, probably in November 1697. Hopkins ascribed its success to the versification; he was, Dryden wrote, &#145;a poet who writes good verses without knowing how, or why; I mean he writes naturally well, without art or learning, or good sence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of John Dryden</span>, 1942, 124), a just, if faintly ironic, appreciation of Hopkins's undoubted abilities.<br>
<br>Dryden's comments, in a letter of 7 November 1699, were prompted by the opening night of what was to be Hopkins's final play, <span class="italic">Friendship Improv'd, or, The Female Warriour</span> (published 1700). It is unlikely that the author saw the production: the dedication to Edward Coke of Norfolk, written in Londonderry and dated 1 November 1699, attests to his poor health. In <span class="italic">A Select Collection of Poems</span>, John Nichols reprints a none the less characteristically poised hymn written &#145;about an hour before his death, when in great pain&#146;. Hopkins died in the parish of Templemore, Londonderry, from the effects, it was stated, of a dissipated life, and was buried, presumably in Templemore, on 7 March 1700.<br>
