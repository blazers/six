<span class="headword">Lyde,  Lionel William</span>  (1863&#150;1947), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 28 March 1863 at the vicarage, Wigton, Cumberland, the eldest son of William Lyde (1829/30&#150;1914), vicar of Wigton, and his wife, Elizabeth Emily Hart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chamberlain (1841/2&#150;1874). He was educated at Sedbergh School, and at Queen's College, Oxford, where he took a second in classical moderations in 1883 and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1886. He became a schoolmaster, teaching English at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh (1887&#150;90), and the Glasgow Academy (1890&#150;99) before becoming headmaster of Bolton School (1899&#150;1903). In 1896 he married Elizabeth Susan Frances (Lily) Gildea (<i>b</i>. 1868), daughter of Major-General George Gildea.<br>
<br>Lyde's first book was <span class="italic">An Introduction to Ancient History</span> (1890), which considered classical events in relation to environmental conditions, and was followed by texts on Scottish history, English grammar, poetry, and the plays of Shakespeare. Lyde also developed a fascination for geography, publishing five <span class="roman">Elementary Geography</span> titles on parts of the British empire in 1892&#150;3, followed by <span class="italic">A Commercial Geography of the British Empire</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Man on Earth</span> (1895), <span class="italic">Black's School Geography</span> (1897), <span class="italic">Man and His Markets</span> (1898), and <span class="italic">A School Geography of the World</span> (1899). Already a fellow of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1901. Two years later Edmund Johnston Garwood, professor of geology at University College, London (UCL), advocated that human geography should be taught in the college. The senate of the University of London and the council of UCL accepted his case for a new chair in economic geography, which was offered to Lyde. The teaching of human geography was duly reinstated at UCL, after the tenure of Alexander Maconochie (1833&#150;6). In 1903 Lyde was the only holder of a chair of geography in the British Isles.<br>
<br>Until 1919 Lyde taught students reading for non-specialist degrees and schoolteachers enhancing their qualifications. In 1903&#150;4 he delivered sixty lectures on economic geography and regional geography. He published three <span class="roman">Elementary Geography</span> titles in 1904, on Asia, America, and the British Isles, and worked with Colonel Mockler-Ferryman on <span class="italic">A Military Geography of the Balkan Peninsula</span> (1905). Lyde displayed a remarkable and unflagging talent for distilling information into brief textbooks and attractive lectures. <span class="italic">A Short Commercial Geography</span> (1906) was followed by <span class="italic">A Child's Geography of England and Wales</span> (1908), <span class="italic">The Teaching of Geography</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Man in Many Lands</span> (1910), and four <span class="roman">Junior Geography</span> titles in 1914; later books in that series appeared in the 1920s. <span class="italic">Some Frontiers of Tomorrow: an Aspiration for Europe</span> (1915) advocated peace from the depths of war. Lyde was still a comparatively young man when his publishers gave a dinner to mark the sale of 2 million copies of his books; by the end of his life his sales exceeded 4 million.<br>
<br>Lyde taught alone for most of his tenure at UCL, and also lectured at the London School of Economics in 1905&#150;6 and 1912&#150;17. Students reading for the BSc (Econ) degree, instituted at UCL in 1914, attended his classes. He is reputed to have arrived top-hatted for lectures, with the hat concealing his notes and then receiving his lavender gloves. He gained a reputation as an excellent lecturer. His fine voice, the flash of his brilliant eyes, and his unfailing dignity left a powerful impression. He assembled material from newspapers and learned journals, using highly personal turns of phrase to evoke regions, landscapes, and physical and human processes. He was neither explorer nor fieldworker, relying on the published word to fashion his own version of geography. His remarkable powers of assimilation and argument were enhanced by an impressive use of language. For him geography was a synthetic human science, rather than one ruled by environmental determinism. His greatest faults were an inability to distinguish the important from the trivial, and a tendency to advance arguments based on flimsy evidence.<br>
<br>In 1919 Lyde was president of section E (geography) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and inaugurated the honours school of geography at UCL. Five years later he worked with three assistants and received support from staff in cognate disciplines. His own teaching was on Europe and the Mediterranean lands, economic geography being taught by colleagues. Lyde also delivered evening lectures, Saturday classes, and short courses for schoolteachers, being a trustee of the Geographical Association from 1914 to 1947. He continued to revise his elementary texts and prepared more substantial books for university students, such as <span class="italic">Peninsular Europe</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">The Continent of Asia</span> (1933); his much reworked <span class="italic">The Continent of Europe</span> (1913) was still in print in 1930. All these books were illustrated by well-drawn maps but included few references.<br>
<br>Containing forcefully expressed opinions and an amalgam of the relevant and the fanciful, Lyde's publications dominated the market for geography textbooks in Great Britain for many years. They had a massive impact on schoolchildren, teachers, and undergraduates alike. He retired from UCL in 1928, and was replaced by Charles Bungay Fawcett. For a further two decades he updated his textbooks and produced completely new works. He died at his home, the Old House, Gloucester Street, Cirencester, of heart failure on 24 January 1947, and was survived by his wife and two sons.<br>
