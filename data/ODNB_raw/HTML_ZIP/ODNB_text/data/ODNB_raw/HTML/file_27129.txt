<span class="headword">Tenison,  Richard</span>  (1642&#150;1705), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Meath</span>, was born at Carrickfergus, co. Antrim, the eldest son of Major Thomas Tenison. His father, who apparently was second cousin to Dr Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury, seems to have settled in Ulster shortly before the Irish rising and was bailiff or sheriff of Carrickfergus in 1645. Richard Tenison attended a local school in Carrickfergus before he was sent into the care of Francis Radcliffe at St Bees School, Cumberland. He was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, on 2 November 1659 at seventeen. There is no record of Tenison receiving any degree in the college registers but he was referred to as MA in some contemporary documents. He was appointed to the mastership of Trim Diocesan School, where he taught with considerable success before taking holy orders. By 1666 he had married a woman whose name is unknown, his eldest surviving son, Henry, being born in that year.<br>
<br>Tenison was appointed chaplain to Arthur Capel, earl of Essex, shortly after Essex had been appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1672. Essex awarded him the sinecures of the rectories of Laracor and Augher, the vicarages of Donaghmore and St Peter's, Drogheda, and the deanery of Clogher. In February 1682 Tenison was consecrated at Christ Church, Dublin, as bishop of Killala, and during the same year was awarded a DD by Trinity College. He had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1696), daughter of John Norbury, by 1684, the year in which Richard, the first of their five sons, was born. By 1688 Tenison and John Vesey, archbishop of Tuam, were the only prelates in the province of Connaught. Along with Vesey he gave &#145;encouragement to the Protestants as long as they remained without imminent danger of their own lives&#146;  (Mant, 1.697) before they were finally forced to remove to England in that year. Tenison settled in London, where he was employed as lecturer alongside Henry Hesketh in the parish of St Helen, Bishopsgate. He was probably placed in this position with the aid of Thomas Tenison, who was at that time rector of St Martin-in-the-Fields and St James's, Piccadilly.<br>
<br>After the Williamite victory Tenison returned to Ireland, where he was presented to the see of Clogher on 26 February 1691. Hesketh was nominated to replace him as bishop of Killala but was never consecrated. Tenison was among the group of Church of Ireland reforming bishops in the 1690s associated with William King and Nathaniel Foy. While bishop of Clogher he completed substantial repairs to the bishop's palace at his own expense, and obtained a reputation for preaching &#145;by which he reduced many dissenters to the church&#146; and in one visitation confirmed about 2500 people  (Harris, 2.191). In June 1697 he was translated to the bishopric of Meath. During the following year he became vice-chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, and was later elected a privy councillor. He died probably in co. Meath on 29 July 1705 and was buried in the chapel of Trinity College. Tenison did not publish any major scholarly work save for five of his sermons. His will benefited the poor of Navan and Kells and bequeathed &pound;200 to set up a fund for the support of orphans and widows of clergymen, an example that he desired others would emulate. He was survived by his six sons, two of whom, Henry and Richard, sat as MPs in Irish parliaments; his sons Norbury and Thomas were named as beneficiaries of Archbishop Tenison's will. His offspring were the forerunners of the Hanbury-Tenison family of Lough Bawn, co. Monaghan.<br>
