<span class="headword">Rogers <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Roe]</span>,  Hester Ann</span>  (1756&#150;1794), <span class="occ">Methodist writer</span>, was born on 31 January 1756 in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where her father, James Roe (<i>d</i>. 1765), was the Anglican clergyman. She received a good education, presumably at the hands of her strict but sincere father, who died on 10 April 1765. She was confirmed by the bishop of Chester at Whitsuntide 1769 and very opposed to Methodism, but in 1774 was influenced by David Simpson, the evangelical clergyman at Christ Church, Macclesfield. She dated her conversion from 11 November 1774, having been affected by the preaching of Samuel Bardsley, the Wesleyan Methodist itinerant in Macclesfield. Her family was outraged and virtually disowned her, but when she threatened to leave home and go into service they relented. Hester then proposed to become her mother's servant on condition she could attend Methodist meetings. Her mother, thinking it would not last, agreed, but Hester persevered, winning her freedom after eight months. Her journal dates from this time. She first met John Wesley in April 1776 and they began a lifelong correspondence. He made her a class leader in 1781 and she became a dedicated sick visitor.<br>
<br>Hester first met James Rogers (1749&#150;1807) on 27 March 1781. When he came to Macclesfield in 1782 as the Wesleyan Methodist itinerant she became close friends with the family, but was shocked in December 1783 when his wife Martha (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Knowlden) said she hoped Hester would marry James after her death. Martha died on 15 February 1784, leaving two sons, Joseph (aged four) and Benjamin (aged two), and after much heart-searching James and Hester married on 19 August 1784, sailing for Dublin nine days later. They remained there until 1787, when they moved to Cork, going on to Bandon, co. Cork, in 1789. While in Dublin Hester became a class leader and started her <span class="italic">Spiritual Letters</span> (1796), which, together with extracts from her diary, was extensively used as a devotional book. She also contributed to the <span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span> and wrote poetry.<br>
<br>In 1790 Wesley brought the family back from Ireland to the New Chapel, City Road, London, intending Hester to be his housekeeper, though these duties were not taken up on account of her ill health. Both she and James were at Wesley's deathbed in March 1791. In September 1793 they moved to Belmont Road Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Birmingham, and in the following year attended the Bristol conference as Hester was particularly anxious to see their sons&#151;Joseph, a printing apprentice, and schoolboys Benjamin and James. She died at the Belmont Road manse, Birmingham, on 10 October 1794 shortly after giving birth to her fifth child. She was buried in St Mary's chapel yard, Birmingham, where a memorial obelisk was erected.<br>
