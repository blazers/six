<span class="headword">Clifford,  Arthur</span>  (1777&#150;1830), <span class="occ">family historian</span>, was born on 5 July 1777, the fourth son of the nine children of Thomas Clifford (1732&#150;1787), fourth son of Hugh Clifford, third Lord Clifford of Chudleigh (1700&#150;1732). His mother was Barbara Aston (1744&#150;1786), youngest daughter and coheir of James, fifth Lord Aston of Forfar (1723&#150;1751); through her the estate of Tixall, in Staffordshire, came into the Clifford family. With his twin brother, Lewis (<i>d</i>. 1806), Arthur Clifford became a pupil at the English College at Douai in September 1786; when the college was taken over by French revolutionary forces, both were imprisoned, with the professors and other students. After their release, they returned to England, and reached London in March 1795; Lewis later wrote a brief account of their captivity. After spending a term at Stonyhurst College, Arthur Clifford rejoined some of his former fellow prisoners at St Edmund's College, Old Hall Green, near Ware, in late 1795. In May or June 1809 he married Eliza Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1827), daughter of Captain John Macdonnell of Leagh, Inverness-shire; the couple had one daughter and two sons, the eldest of whom, Arthur Lewis (1818&#150;1841), became a Jesuit.<br>
<br>In 1809 Clifford published <span class="italic">The State Papers and Letters of Sir Ralph Sadler</span> (2 vols.); Sadler's granddaughter Gertrude had married Sir Walter (later Lord) Aston (1584&#150;1639) and Clifford drew his materials from original manuscripts found at Tixall. Allegedly stored in an old oaken box and preserved by female members of the family from destruction, the papers had been deciphered, copied, and generally prepared for publication by John Kirk (1760&#150;1851) in the 1790s. Thus Clifford's part in the preparation of the collection for publication must have been relatively small, as Sir Walter Scott wrote both the memoir of Sadler's life and the historical notes that accompanied the work. These tasks interrupted Scott's writing of <span class="italic">Marmion</span> (1808), and involved the poet in correspondence with the Durham antiquary Robert Surtees (1779&#150;1834). <span class="italic">The State Papers and Letters</span> received an unfavourable review in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, where the critic opined that &#145;its inaccuracy is still more remarkable than its beauty &hellip; the whole publication bears the marks of great negligence and precipitancy on the part of all concerned&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 16, August 1810, 461). Nevertheless, it was a far more complete publication than the earlier 1720 collection of Sadler's papers.<br>
<br>At Tixall, Clifford also found letters and papers relating to the family of Sir Walter Aston; this discovery led to his publication in 1813 of <span class="italic">Tixall Poetry</span>, a collection of poems either written or transcribed by members of the Aston family, concluding with Clifford's own verses. Among these was his &#145;Midnight Meditation among the Ruins of Tixall&#146;, also published separately. <span class="italic">Tixall Poetry</span> was the subject of two complimentary essays in Nathan Drake's <span class="italic">Evenings in Autumn</span> (2 vols., 1822). Of more note, however, was Clifford's collection <span class="italic">Tixall letters, or, Correspondence of the Aston family and their friends during the seventeenth century</span> (1815), which sheds light on the family life of the seventeenth-century Catholic gentry. It includes interesting correspondence relating to Walter Aston's conversion to Roman Catholicism and the courtship by his son Herbert (promoted avidly by his sister Constantia) of his future wife, Catherine Thimelby, as well as the letters of Winefred Thimelby, an abbess in Louvain, to Herbert. Clifford also published <span class="italic">Collectanea Cliffordiana</span> (1817), a miscellany of material relating to his family, including a tragedy from his own pen; in the same year he also published, with his elder brother Sir Thomas Hugh Constable Clifford, <span class="italic">A Topographical and Historical Description of the Parish of Tixall</span>.<br>
<br>Both these works were published in Paris: Clifford's unfortunate experiences during the revolutionary years do not seem to have prejudiced him against France, as he lived and wrote for many years in the French capital. In addition to editing a paper for the French publisher Galignani, he also wrote guides for him to Paris (n.d.), France (1822), Italy (1823), and Switzerland (1823). He also seems to have acted as editor of the <span class="italic">Antiquities and Anecdotes of the City of Paris</span> (n.d.). Clifford also published (in Oxford) several works on the teaching of languages, especially Greek and Latin. He died at Winchester on 16 January 1830.<br>
