<span class="headword">Martin, Sir  William Fanshawe</span>, fourth baronet  (1801&#150;1895), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18214/', "Sir Thomas Byam Martin (1773&#150;1854)")</script> and his wife, Catherine, daughter of Captain Robert Fanshawe RN, was born on 5 December 1801. He entered the navy in June 1813, served under his father's flag off the Scheldt, and in January 1816 was appointed to the <i>Alceste</i>, then going to China with Lord Amherst. After his return he was in the yacht <i>Prince Regent</i> with Sir Edward Hamilton, and in the frigate <i>Glasgow</i> with Captain Anthony Maitland in the Mediterranean. On 15 December 1820 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Forte</i>, and a few months later was moved into the <i>Aurora</i>, going out to the South American station, where, on 8 February 1823, he was promoted commander of the sloop <i>Fly</i>. In her he rendered valuable assistance to the British merchants at Callao in a time of civil war, and was afterwards known in the navy as Fly Martin. He attained post rank on 5 June 1824. From 1826 to 1831 Martin commanded the frigate <i>Samarang</i> (28 guns) in the Mediterranean. On 25 July 1827, he married Anne Best (<i>d</i>. 1836), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2294/', "Hon. William Best, the first Baron Wynford")</script>. They had two sons who died young, and two daughters. On 21 May 1838 he married Sophia Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 12 Nov 1874), daughter of Robert Hurt of Wirksworth; they had five daughters and one son, Richard Byam Martin, who succeeded to the baronetcy. Up to 1831 Martin's career was driven by the powerful position filled by his father, thereafter he spent the 1830s on half pay while the whigs held office. The ill health of his first wife, who died on 1 April 1836, and the care of his children also kept him from the sea until he had remarried.<br>
<br>In 1844 and 1845 Martin was flag captain at Sheerness, and in 1845&#150;6 he commanded ships in the squadrons of evolution, demonstrating his strong antipathy towards those designed by Sir William Symonds. From 1849 to 1852 he was commodore in command of the Lisbon squadron, where he carried out a series of trials that demonstrated the suitability of the screw propeller as an auxiliary source of power in large sailing ships, which led directly to the decision to build an all-steam navy, taken in 1852. On 28 May 1853 he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral. From 1853 until his promotion to vice-admiral on 13 February 1858, he was superintendent of Portsmouth Dockyard, an appointment that reflected the esteem in which his father was still held. Here he demonstrated great ability, having to administer the largest dockyard at a critical period, meeting the twin demands of the Crimean War and the Anglo-French naval race. Between March 1858 and June 1859 he was senior naval lord in Lord Derby's second ministry, a post that recognized both his standing in the service and his strong tory politics. Although he refused to take a seat in the House of Commons, Martin dominated the board, especially in the all too frequent absence of the first lord, Sir John Pakington. He stopped Pakington's scheme to remove naval patronage from the board to the first lord's private office, by threatening to resign. An advocate of heavier artillery, Martin led the discussions that culminated in the order for the first British seagoing ironclad, HMS <i>Warrior</i>, part of a reconstruction of the navy to reflect the experience of the Crimean War and the strategic impact of new technology. In 1860 he was appointed to the command of the Mediterranean station, primarily to develop steam tactics, an area where the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, believed that the navy was falling behind the French. His systems of evolution, practised on a small scale, and then tried at sea, were meant to train the officers of the fleet to understand the limitations of their equipment, and ensure that they could execute the relatively simple manoeuvres required in battle with speed and precision. He held this post for three years, and in that time effected a major reform of naval discipline. Many of the ships of his fleet were manned by &#145;bounty&#146; men and were bordering on mutiny. Martin none the less made the fleet into an excellent fighting force. His insistence on obedience was not always agreeable to captains and commanders, but if not loved, he was feared, and the work was done.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1861 Martin was made KCB, and on 14 November 1863 became an admiral; on the death of his cousin, Sir Henry Martin, third baronet, he succeeded to the baronetcy on 4 December 1863. From 1866 to 1869 he was commander-in-chief at Plymouth. In April 1870 he was retired under the scheme introduced by Hugh Childers. On 24 May 1873 he was made a GCB, and in September 1878 appointed rear-admiral of the United Kingdom. In 1879 he published a small pamphlet, <span class="italic">Cyprus as a Naval Station and a Place of Arms</span>, an exposition of Mediterranean strategy. In his later years he resided mainly at Upton Grey, near Winchfield, Hampshire, and he died there on 24 March 1895.<br>
<br>After a career made by his father, and from whom he took his politics, his professional ideas, and much else, Martin proved a worthy beneficiary of his rapid advancement. Although a bitter partisan of the tory party Martin was a thorough professional, who earned the respect of all who served with him. One of the most important flag officers of the era, he was a critical architect of the thoroughly professional service.<br>
