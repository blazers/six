<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hastings, Sir  Stephen Lewis Edmonstone</span>  (1921&#150;2005), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 4 May 1921, at 13 Washington House, Basil Street, Knightsbridge, London, the only son of Major Lewis Aloysius Macdonald Hastings (1880&#150;1966) and his wife, Meriel Eda St John (1888&#150;1971), daughter of Neil Edmonstone, lieutenant-colonel in the 4th hussars. His father had absconded from Stonyhurst College after being accused of homosexuality, and went to southern Africa, where he prospected for diamonds, joined the Cape Mounted Police, became a political organizer, and commanded the emergency reserves during the Johannesburg strikes of 1913. After war service he bought a tobacco farm in Southern Rhodesia in 1922, founded the Southern Rhodesian Tobacco Growers' Association, and was MP for the Lomagundi constituency in the Southern Rhodesian parliament from 1931 until his return to England in 1939 to rejoin the army. He became one of the most popular and pungent of the BBC's war correspondents, and made his first parachute jump at the age of sixty-three. Brandishing his stick, he liberated Bremen town hall in 1945, and was among the first to enter Buchenwald concentration camp. He was a remote but heroic figure in his son's boyhood; his sturdy individualism, contempt for doubters, imperial pride, intrepid war service, and mistrust of progressive beliefs were exemplary for his son.<br>
<br>A bout of malaria resulted in Stephen Hastings's return from Rhodesia to live in Berkshire with his maternal grandmother, who doted on him as a surrogate son and encouraged his lifelong passion for horses. He was educated at Durnford School, Langton Matravers, Dorset (1929&#150;34), Eton College (1934&#150;9), and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1939). After being commissioned into the Scots Guards on the outbreak of the Second World War, he fought against the Italians and Germans in the desert until 1943, when he joined the Special Air Service and participated in daring raids in Benghazi and elsewhere. He was briefly aide-de-camp to Richard Casey, minister resident in Cairo, before training as a Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent. In 1944 he was parachuted behind enemy lines in the Apennines, and organized three divisions of about 4000 Italian partisans, who seized Piacenza and held a bridgehead over the Po for three days. He was awarded the MC. After the war he was based in Vienna as personal assistant to the head of the economic division of the control commission in Austria (1946&#150;8).<br>
<br>In 1948 Hastings was recruited by a friend of his father's into the Secret Intelligence Service (M16). Under the guise of an assistant military attach&eacute; at the British legation in Helsinki (1950&#150;53) he watched the Russian bear during a freezing phase of the cold war. He was posted to the British embassy in Paris in 1954&#150;8, and then to Cyprus as first secretary in the political office of the Middle East forces' headquarters during the guerrilla war with EOKA. He was in post in Paris at the time of the Hungarian uprising and the Suez d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, and, in disgust at the mood of national retreat in Britain, applied to Conservative central office to join the parliamentary candidates' list. This resulted in his election as Conservative MP for Mid-Bedfordshire at a by-election in 1960.<br>
<br>Just as Lewis Hastings scorned the influence in Britain of &#145;the Nancy Left&#146; and &#145;bottle-party intellectuals&#146;  (L. Hastings, 224, 256), so his son regarded socialism as an egregious mixture of the ideas of Karl Marx, John Knox, and Father Christmas. He was an effective Commons performer, thorny in his questioning of ministers and adept at calling for emergency debates. A forceful speaker, with an officer's authoritative tones, he was upright and gallant, but out of tune with his parliamentary leaders, though his views chimed with many party members.<br>
<br>In 1961 Hastings paid the first of many political visits to Rhodesia, and he soon became a vocal opponent of official British policy in southern Africa. He opposed immediate majority black rule, and felt that the Macmillan government was surrendering to African nationalist extremism. When the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence in 1965 Hastings rebelled against his party's line, and opposed economic sanctions. His support for the Rhodesian rebels rendered him ineligible for office under Edward Heath's leadership (1964&#150;75). He opposed the Lancaster House agreement of 1979, which created Zimbabwe and brought Robert Mugabe to power. He was a stalwart member of the Monday Club, and deplored Whitehall defeatism, Commonwealth idealism, and American prejudice against British colonialism. Julian Amery and Ronald Bell were his diehard allies in resisting decolonization and multiculturalism.<br>
<br>Hastings's connection to the security services was well known, and he monitored communist infiltration of British trade unions and institutions in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1976&#150;8 he formed a secret advisory committee, code-named Shield, which also included Nicholas Elliott of MI6 and Brian Crozier, to brief Margaret Thatcher and her shadow cabinet colleagues on communist subversion in Britain. Shield adduced evidence that there was a plot to turn Britain into a communist state on the east European model, and in the Commons in 1977 Hastings named five trade union leaders whom Czech intelligence officers had tried to suborn on behalf of the KGB. The Shield committee's recommendation of a counter-subversion executive to act as a cold war equivalent of SOE, under MI6, was defeated by Lord Carrington, the shadow foreign secretary, at a meeting in 1978 chaired by Thatcher, and attended by, among others, Sir Keith Joseph and William Whitelaw. Hastings obtained libel damages from <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1986 after that newspaper named him as part of an MI5 plot to oust Harold Wilson.<br>
<br>As a backbench MP, Hastings became a non-executive director of several companies, including Anglo-European Marketing Ltd and the Handley Page aircraft factory at Cricklewood. This led him to a keen interest in the aviation sector. He deplored the cancellation in 1965 of the TSR2 tactical strike aircraft as a betrayal both of British strategic power and of aeronautical manufacturing, and published his polemic <span class="italic">The Murder of TSR2</span> in 1966. The book was dismissed in some quarters as the result of heavy, embittered briefing by special interests. His pillorying of Lord Mountbatten and Lord Zuckerman, who had put their weight into the scales against TSR2, and of the Treasury for mishandling the project's steeply rising costs and squandering technical expertise, showed his powers of invective, but the book was thoughtful in its analysis of the difficulties when the rate of scientific development outstrips managerial organization, and in drawing lessons for the nuclear energy and electronics sectors. Hastings was also active in campaigns to stop a large airport being built in the vale of Aylesbury.<br>
<br>Hastings was knighted in July 1983, a month after his retirement from parliament. A painter, sculptor, and raconteur, who drank with gusto and had a great sense of fun, he loved horses and Labradors, hunted regularly with the Quorn, and was president of the British Field Sports Society in 1982. His autobiography, <span class="italic">The Drums of Memory</span>, was published in 1994.<br>
<br>Hastings married, on 29 September 1948, Harriet Mary Elizabeth Jephson (<i>b</i>. 1921), a widow, daughter of Colonel Julian Latham Tomlin, director of posts and telegraphs in the Sudan. They had a son and a daughter. This marriage was dissolved in 1971, and in September 1975 he married Elizabeth Anne Marie Gabrielle (1934&#150;1997), formerly wife of Sir Vivyan Naylor-Leyland, third baronet, and ostensible daughter of the second and last Viscount Fitzalan of Derwent. Her mother, before her birth, had become the lover of the tenth and last Earl Fitzwilliam, and ultimately married him: Elizabeth Hastings inherited the Fitzwilliam estates at Milton, Castor, Cambridgeshire, and Malton, Yorkshire, on his death in 1979. Hastings became a director of the Fitzwilliam Estates Company (1980&#150;97), partner and manager of the Milton Park stud, and joint master of the Fitzwilliam hunt. In 1995 he led an appeal for funds for the preservation and development of Peterborough Cathedral, and raised &pound;7.3 million by the end of 2000. He died of cancer of the oesophagus on 10 January 2005, at his home, Stibbington House, Wansford, Cambridgeshire. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Marholm, on 18 January, following a funeral service at St Kyneburgha's Church, Castor, near Peterborough. A memorial service was held at Peterborough Cathedral on 17 April 2005. He was survived by the two children of his first marriage.<br>
