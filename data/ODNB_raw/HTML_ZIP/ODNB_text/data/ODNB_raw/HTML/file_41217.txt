<span class="headword">Hughes,  William</span>  (1818&#150;1876), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born in Middlesex. Nothing is known of his parentage, early life, or education, though it seems probable that he had no education beyond school. On his election to the fellowship of the Royal Geographical Society on 26 November 1838 he was an engraver of 9 Wharton Street, Pentonville, London. He continued to trade as an engraver, printer, and map seller, but it is as a pioneer of geographical education that he is best remembered. An early teaching appointment was as professor at an (unidentified) college of engineers, but his most influential appointment came in 1840 when he became lecturer at St John's College, Battersea. At this newly established pioneering college which used the methods of Pestalozzi to train poor boys to be teachers in schools for the poor, Hughes taught geography and cartography. His own inclinations to teach by explanation rather than rote learning and to follow the scientific German school of geography were mirrored in the attitude of the school's founder, James Kay-Shuttleworth, who drew inspiration from progressive developments throughout Europe.<br>
<br>While at Battersea Hughes published his first major work, <span class="italic">Principles of Mathematical Geography</span> (1843), a treatise on the construction of maps, which ran to three editions in English and one in Urdu for use by civil engineering students in India. He also continued his engraving and map business and, from 1841 to 1843, worked three days a week in the British Museum, cataloguing maps and charts. He expounded his teaching methods in <span class="italic">Remarks on Geography &hellip; Chiefly with Reference to the Principles upon which it should be Taught in Normal Schools</span> (1847) and a textbook, <span class="italic">A Manual of Geography</span> (1852; reissued 1864).<br>
<br>In 1853 Hughes was appointed to teach geography at the Church of England Metropolitan Training College, Highbury, but was less successful there. He began, possibly in 1858, to teach evening classes at King's College, London, and his success here and his publications, which now included <span class="italic">Classbook of Modern Geography</span> (1859), led to his appointment as first professor of geography at the college in 1864, to teach day-boys, &#145;riotous hobbledehoys sent by parental compulsion&#146;  (Hughes, in Vaughan, 49), and evening classes for serious, eager, older students, many of whom were teachers. From 1863 Hughes was also professor at Queen's College, Harley Street, a women's college. His textbooks were by now used in many leading public schools as well as national schools, and contemporaries found them eminently readable. Unlike most geography textbooks which simply gave lists to be memorized, Hughes sought to help students understand the nature and distribution of phenomena. His methodological writings and lectures stressed the scientific nature of geography, its links with the natural and physical sciences, and his belief that an understanding of physical geography could unify the physical and human, pure and applied, aspects of the subject. He felt that students must be able to draw maps to understand the character of great natural features and thus come to revere the natural world. Through his books for young children, such as <span class="italic">A Child's First Book of Geography</span> (1854), he hoped to excite children's wonder at and interest in studying the world around them. Believing that maps could captivate children's imagination, Hughes published educational maps, wrote the text for a Philips schoolroom map of 1859, and helped produce a map jigsaw puzzle. Despite his publishing success he died in modest circumstances on 21 May 1876 at Adelaide Road, Hampstead, leaving less than &pound;1500. He was survived by a widow, Susanna, and two daughters of whom no more is known.<br>
<br>Unquestionably a pioneer of geographical education, Hughes foreshadowed rather than shared in the main developments in British scientific geography. His death before John Scott Keltie's 1886 report, which revolutionized British geography, combined with lack of money and education, which cut him off from developments in German geography, led to the obscurity from which he was deservedly rescued in the late twentieth century.<br>
