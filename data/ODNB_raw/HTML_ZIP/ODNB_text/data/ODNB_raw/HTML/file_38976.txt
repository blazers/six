<span class="headword">Batsford,  Bradley Thomas</span>  (1821&#150;1904), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born in Hertford, the fifth of the nine children of James Batsford (1791&#150;1835), a tailor, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradley. When his father died he left for London, where he lived with his cousins above their Leicester Square bookshop and bindery. In 1837 he was apprenticed to one of those cousins, the bookseller Henry Bickers. When he came of age in 1842 he inherited &pound;325 from his grandfather, Roger Bradley, which enabled him to set up his own business. On 2 April 1843 he married Letitia Josephine (1821/2&#150;1906), daughter of Raphael Turner, carver and gilder, and opened a bookshop at 30 High Holborn. The shop moved a few years later to 52 High Holborn, then to 94 High Holborn in 1893.<br>
<br>Batsford's sons Bradley Batsford (1846&#150;1906), Henry George Batsford (1851&#150;1882), and Herbert Batsford (1861&#150;1917) all followed him into the business. During the manpower shortage of the First World War, his youngest daughter Florence worked briefly for the firm as a travelling saleswoman&#151;perhaps the first in the British book trade, though she found the job distasteful.<br>
<br>B. T. Batsford began as a medical and general bookseller. In 1862 the death of a competitor, John Weale, who specialized in architectural and engineering books, allowed Batsford to move into that market and out of general bookselling. With his son Bradley taking the initiative, the firm then ventured into publishing. Their first known title was J. K. Colling's <span class="italic">Examples of English Medieval Foliage and Coloured Decoration</span> (1874).<br>
<br>By the end of the century, Batsford had built up an international clientele and a reputation for publishing finely illustrated volumes on architectural history and the decorative arts. In the early 1890s he pioneered the use of photographs in architecture books. He also produced practical handbooks for builders, notably Charles F. Mitchell's <span class="italic">Building Construction and Drawing</span>: first published in 1888, it went through numerous editions and was still selling briskly more than a century later. The firm and its authors were remarkably loyal to each other: J. Alfred Gotch published with Batsford for fifty-six years, including his magisterial <span class="italic">Architecture of the Renaissance in England</span> (1891&#150;4) and <span class="italic">Early Renaissance Architecture in England</span> (1901).<br>
<br>A fire in 1874 destroyed most of the early records of the firm and much of the stock. B. T. Batsford handed the business over to his sons Bradley and Herbert in 1902. He died at his home, 128 Abbey Road, St John's Wood, London, on 3 November 1904. He had published mainly for professional architects, but Herbert would appeal to general readers with beautifully illustrated books on English villages and country houses.<br>
