<span class="headword">Yorke,  Albert Edward Philip Henry</span>, sixth earl of Hardwicke  (1867&#150;1904), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at the British embassy in Paris on 14 March 1867, the only son in the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61075/', "Charles Philip Yorke, fifth earl (1836&#150;1897)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Sophia Georgiana Robertina Wellesley (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of the first Earl Cowley. The prince of Wales, afterwards Edward VII, was his godfather. Styled Viscount Royston until 1897, he was educated at Eton College (1881&#150;4), and served as honorary attach&eacute; at the British embassy in Vienna from 1886 to 1891. His father (Champagne Charlie) had squandered a fortune and the family's estates were put up for sale in 1891. In the following year Royston became a member of the London stock exchange, and in 1897 a partner in the stockbroking firm of Basil Montgomery &amp; Co., succeeding to the earldom upon the death of his father in May 1897. In 1898 he was elected as a moderate (Conservative) member of the London county council, representing West Marylebone, and also acquired the largest part of the ownership of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>.<br>
<br>Hardwicke gained significant political notoriety through a series of events played out in the House of Lords in 1899 and the following year. He was vehemently opposed to the erection of a statue of Oliver Cromwell near the entrance to the house and in August 1899 he took the opportunity, when there were only nine peers present in the house, to move a motion censuring the Salisbury government over this matter. Despite the appeals of the lord chancellor, Lord Halsbury, Hardwicke pushed the issue to a division, and the government was formally censured by five votes to four. Henry Lucy regarded this as most &#145;deplorable&#146; behaviour, and when Hardwicke raised the matter again in the following session, Halsbury, &#145;trembling with indignation&#146;, condemned him for adding &#145;neither to the dignity of the House nor to respect for the decisions of Parliament&#146;  (Lucy, 367).<br>
<br>In November 1900 Hardwicke was appointed parliamentary under-secretary for India. The following month he again came to prominence in the Lords, this time through allegations of a conflict between his business and political interests. He had been permitted by Salisbury, upon taking his position in government, to retain his connection with the stock exchange. This unusual arrangement was immediately seized upon by Lord Rosebery as an opportunity to attack the ethics of the government, claiming that Hardwicke's case risked creating a precedent &#145;full of peril to the interests of the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Nov 1904, 6). Hardwicke was forced to explain to the house that his &#145;financial embarrassments&#146;  (Searle, 50) meant that he was unable to forgo the income from his business connections.<br>
<br>In the office of government itself, Hardwicke was a hard-working and effective under-secretary, and he was transferred, in the same role, to the War Office in August 1902. But here again he found controversy, through his chairmanship of a committee formed to report on the establishment of a formalized intelligence division. In its recommendations the committee went &#145;some way beyond their original brief&#146;  (Gooch, 25) and demanded sweeping changes throughout significant parts of the office. This was &#145;rejected comprehensively&#146; by senior officials  (ibid., 26), and Hardwicke pursued the matter to the War Office council where, however, the matter was allowed quietly to lapse.<br>
<br>In 1903 Hardwicke returned to the India Office, again as under-secretary. He died suddenly of heart failure on 29 November 1904, at his home, 8 York Terrace, Regent's Park, London, and was buried at the Marylebone borough cemetery, East Finchley, Middlesex, on 3 December. He was unmarried.<br>
