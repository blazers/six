<span class="headword">George,  Georgina</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Oldmixon]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1835), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, was born in Oxford, the daughter of Tobias George. She was sometimes described as coming from the pipe office, Oxford, so her father may have been a clerk employed in connection with the sheriff's accounts for Oxfordshire. She made her d&eacute;but at the Holywell Music Room, Oxford, on 11 February 1779 and sang regularly in Oxford concerts for four years. In November 1780 her father was involved in an acrimonious dispute between the cellist G. Monro and her teacher, Dr Philip Hayes, over her non-appearance at Monro's benefit, from which it is clear that her father was not a clergyman as has been stated. She moved to London in 1783 to sing at the Haymarket Theatre in the summer and began a three-year engagement at Drury Lane that autumn. She made her stage d&eacute;but as Rosetta in the pasticcio <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> and then sang Euphrosyne in Thomas Arne's <span class="italic">Comus</span> and the taxing role of Mandane in his <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span>. She became a great favourite at the Haymarket in light musical pieces composed by Samuel Arnold, William Shield, and Charles Dibdin, singing there each summer (except for 1788, when she was ill) until 15 September 1789, when she made her last London appearance. She was less successful in the larger, more demanding Drury Lane Theatre, where she was criticized in the press for laughing and talking on stage when in the chorus of singing witches in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. Her contract was not extended beyond 1786, and she worked at the Brighton Theatre that autumn. When Mary Ann Wrighten left Drury Lane for the USA the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> of 3 January 1787 suggested that since one star had left, the wandering but brilliant &#145;Georgium Sidus&#146; might be employed. (This flattering use of Herschel's name for his recently discovered planet Uranus has led to modern reference books describing Georgina George as &#145;<i>n&eacute;e</i> Sidus&#146;.) Miss George was a soprano soloist in the Lent oratorios at Drury Lane in 1784&#150;8 and also sang at Ranelagh. She moved to the Edinburgh Theatre in spring 1788 and to Dublin that autumn, and returned to Edinburgh for the first few months of 1789, when she also fitted in a week with Tate Wilkinson's company in York, playing seven leading roles to fashionable and crowded houses. In Dublin in 1790&#150;91 she sang at the Rotunda concerts and at the Crow Street Theatre, where in November 1790 she played Lucy to Elizabeth Billington's Polly in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. After Mrs Billington had been applauded for singing her verse of their duet in the second act with sweetness and expression,<blockquote>Miss George in reply, availing herself of her extraordinary compass of voice, and setting propriety at defiance, sang the whole of her verse an octave higher, her tones having the effect of the high notes of a sweet and brilliant flute. (Parke, 128)</blockquote>At Cork the following year their relationship on stage &#145;could compare to nothing but St. George and the Dragon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hibernian Chronicle</span>, 20 Oct 1791).<br>
<br>While performing in John Palmer's new Royalty Theatre in east London in winter 1787&#150;8, Miss George sang in <span class="italic">Apollo Turn'd Stroller</span> by Sir John Morella Oldmixon (1758?&#150;1818), a man of fashion and army officer whom she appears to have married between 1788 and 1793. They were in financial difficulties by May 1793, when she was recruited by Thomas Wignell for his new theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. As Mrs Oldmixon, she made her d&eacute;but at the Chestnut Street Theatre as Clorinda in Shield's <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span> on 14 May 1794. She began to take non-singing roles, such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan's Mrs Malaprop in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> and Mrs Candour in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. When she appeared at the Park Theatre, New York, in 1798&#150;9, she was the highest-paid performer &#145;engaged for the first comic singing characters, and her choice of serious ones&#151;the best comic old women, and the best chambermaids&#146;  (Ireland, 181). Mrs Oldmixon also performed in the pleasure gardens, and many songs, including several by American composers, were published as sung by her. The Oldmixons had separated by January 1809, when a New York paper called her &#145;a widow with seven children dependent on a mother's professional talents for support&#146;  (Porter, 223). Sir John died in eccentric obscurity in 1818. As late as May 1810 the New York theatrical correspondent of the <span class="italic">Mirror of Taste</span> described her as &#145;the only female singer among us!&#146; Mrs Oldmixon retired from the stage in 1814 and settled in Philadelphia, where she ran a ladies' academy with two of her daughters. She died on 3 February 1835.<br>
