<span class="headword">Mercer, Sir  Walter</span>  (1890&#150;1971), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 19 March 1890 at Cockholmbank, Stow, Midlothian, the second son of Ebenezer Beattie Mercer, a woollen manufacturer, and his wife, Jessie Mary Graham (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Greenfield). He was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1907. From there he graduated MB, ChB in 1912, and then held a number of posts as house officer in hospitals at Carlisle and Berwick upon Tweed. In 1915 he joined the King's Own Scottish Borderers as the regimental medical officer, and later the Royal Scots Fusiliers. He served on the western front at the battle of the Somme, on the Messines Ridge at the third battle of Ypres, and at base hospitals in France and Italy. During the war Mercer received a permanent injury to the index finger of his left hand, but this was never allowed to interfere with his dexterity as a surgeon.<br>
<br>In 1918 Mercer joined the Edinburgh War Hospital at Bangour, West Lothian. There he met several distinguished American orthopaedic surgeons, who aroused his interest in orthopaedics. After demobilization in 1920 he was appointed as surgeon in charge of the Tynecastle Orthopaedic Clinic, Edinburgh, which was set up to care for disabled ex-servicemen. In 1921 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In the same year he became assistant surgeon to Professor John Fraser at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, where he was responsible for both the emergency and the elective work in orthopaedic surgery as well as being a clinical tutor. On 14 March 1923 Mercer married Helen May Margaret (Maisie) Lunan (<i>b</i>. 1899/1900), daughter of George Lunan, a pharmaceutical chemist, and his wife, Sarah Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Milne). They adopted a son, David. In 1925 Mercer was appointed consultant surgeon to the South Eastern Counties of Scotland Sanatorium, East Fortune, East Lothian, which specialized in caring for patients with tuberculosis and where he was especially interested in the effects of tuberculosis on the bones and joints. He later became a consultant in tuberculosis at the City Hospital, Edinburgh, and at Bangour, where he established the thoracic unit for the east of Scotland during the Second World War.<br>
<br>Mercer published <span class="italic">Orthopaedic Surgery</span> in 1932 and this became a standard textbook, running to eight editions. It was his most important publication. He also wrote many articles on orthopaedics. In recognition of his work he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1935. During the war Mercer was appointed consultant in orthopaedic surgery to the Department of Health, Scotland, and chaired the Ministry of Health advisory committee on artificial limbs. Despite all this Mercer was essentially still a general surgeon, skilfully performing operations in abdominal, thoracic, and vascular surgery. To extend his range, immediately after the war he went to the USA to train in cardiac surgery under Alfred Blalock at Baltimore, where he also undertook research on babies born with congenital heart defects. Mercer then returned to Edinburgh, to concentrate on heart surgery at the Royal Infirmary. In 1948 he became the first occupant of the Law chair in orthopaedic surgery at Edinburgh University, and he devoted himself exclusively to orthopaedics. His teaching ward rounds were attended by large numbers of postgraduates from all over the world. He set high standards for his surgical trainees, by whom he was greatly respected, and was universally recognized as a most skilled and dexterous surgeon in all aspects of surgery. His reputation was enhanced by his becoming chairman of the editorial board of the <span class="italic">Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery</span> from 1954 to 1961 and vice-president of the British Orthopaedic Association.<br>
<br>In 1951 Mercer became president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; hitherto the college had acted merely as a surgical examining body, but under Mercer it adopted a more active role. Mercer started short courses in surgery to help postgraduates, especially those from overseas, to prepare for their fellowship and other examinations. For the fellows he founded the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh</span> in 1955 and organized regular clinical meetings, to enable them to keep abreast with the latest surgical developments and with college news. He then laid plans to redevelop the college buildings, and the work began in 1960. Mercer was knighted in 1956 and made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. In the next year he retired as professor of orthopaedic surgery and as president of the college. From 1959 to 1971 he was honorary librarian of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In 1960 he was appointed a deputy lord lieutenant of the county of the city of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>A contemporary noted that Mercer<blockquote>moved and spoke with a briskness characteristic of his operating. He never wasted time but always had an ear for any approach worthy of consideration. He was impatient of irrelevance and vague discussion and preferred the direct approach to any problem surgical or personal. To his intimate circle he showed a sense of humour and a warm understanding of problems which superficially might have seemed contrary to his outward, almost mechanical, efficiency. (<span class="italic">Lancet</span>, 501)</blockquote>Mercer, whose hobbies had included tennis and golf, died in Edinburgh on 23 February 1971 of heart disease. He was survived by his wife and son.<br>
