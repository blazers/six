<span class="headword">Charlton,  Donald Geoffrey</span>  (1925&#150;1995), <span class="occ">scholar of French literature</span>, was born on 8 April 1925 at Haslam Maternity Home, Heaton, Bolton, the son of Harry Charlton, local government clerk, and his wife, Hilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whittle. He was educated at Bolton School and read philosophy on a short course scheme at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1943&#150;4 before enlisting in the Royal Navy as an interpreter in French and German. In 1946 he returned to university studies, but this time to read modern languages at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1948 with first-class honours. Elected an Emmanuel College research scholar, he was appointed the following year to an assistant lectureship at the University College of Hull. He spent fourteen happy years at Hull, where he met Thelma Doreen Edith Masters (daughter of Albert Wilfred Masters, a psychiatric nurse), who was studying to become a social worker. They married at St James's Church, Darwen, Lancashire, on 26 June 1952, and had one son and two daughters. Charlton worked for a London PhD under the direction of H. J. Hunt, participated actively in the administration of a college that was preparing its submission for a university charter (granted in 1954), became secretary and chairman of the local Association of University Teachers, and added adult education classes to his work for the French department.<br>
<br>Charlton was awarded his PhD in 1955 for a thesis on positivism, which was published in 1959 as <span class="italic">Positivist Thought in France during the Second Empire, 1852&#150;1870</span>. This was followed in 1963 by <span class="italic">Secular Religions in France, 1815&#150;1870</span>. In the same year he was appointed to the chair of French at the new University of Warwick, which was planned to open in 1964. This gave him the opportunity to put into practice his ideas for a much wider programme of French studies than the exclusive concentration on language and literature then characteristic of modern language syllabuses, with opportunities to study French political and social history, philosophy, art, and soon cinema.<br>
<br>At Warwick Charlton played a leading role for the next twenty-five years in the creation of one of the most successful of the new universities, while remaining for twenty-one of those years an inspiring chairman of department and creative gadfly for the humanities as a whole. In the complicated business of day-to-day administration he never lost sight of the wider educational issues, and in later years he served on the National Council of Languages in Further and Higher Education, on the committee for the Association of University Professors of French, and on the editorial boards of new journals like the <span class="italic">European Studies Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal of European Studies</span>, and <span class="italic">Parnasse</span>. In 1972 he produced an influential multidisciplinary volume <span class="italic">France: a Companion to French Studies</span>, long the standard book of reference, and in 1984 a similar two-volume collection of international essays, <span class="italic">The French Romantics</span>. In 1961&#150;2 he had already spent a year at the University of Toronto, and he returned to North America often to lecture, to listen, and to advise on new developments: in 1966 to Berkeley, in 1969&#150;70 to Yale, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Brown, the City University of New York, and Toronto, in 1972 to Laval University, Quebec, and in 1981 to the University of California at Santa Barbara and Riverside. A brilliant speaker, in 1983 he was invited to give the Gifford lectures at the University of St Andrews, and delivered a series subsequently published as <span class="italic">New Images of the Natural in France: a Study in European Cultural History, 1750&#150;1800</span> (1984). It was characteristic that when he was elected president of the Society for French Studies in 1988 he succeeded in rejuvenating the annual conference of the society with a forward-looking programme.<br>
<br>Charlton encouraged broad views of cultural developments in his teaching and the same outlook governed his research, which proved most influential on the history of nineteenth-century thought. In particular the Methodist lay preacher he had once been remained fascinated by the nineteenth-century struggle to fill the gap left after the French Revolution by the loss of faith and sense of community. On retiring in 1984 he settled with his wife in Bath and was appointed to a part-time visiting professorship of French at the University of Bristol. The Festschrift that was presented to him in 1993, <span class="italic">French Literature, Thought and Culture in the Nineteenth Century: a Material World</span>, reflected the breadth of his views, and showed clearly the affection and admiration with which he was regarded by colleagues and pupils. He died of heart disease on 22 December 1995 while on holiday in Tenerife and was survived by his wife and their children.<br>
