<span class="headword">Collingwood,  William Gershom</span>  (1854&#150;1932), <span class="occ">author, artist, and antiquary</span>, was born on 6 August 1854 at 87 Chatham Street, Liverpool, the eldest son of the artist William Collingwood (1819&#150;1903), of the Royal Watercolour Society, and his wife, Marie Imhoff (<i>d</i>. 1873) of Arbon, Switzerland. At Liverpool College he acquired sound classical scholarship, but much of his early life was spent travelling and drawing with his father in the Alps. Meanwhile in England he spent long holidays in the cottage of a fisherman, William Alexander, at Gillhead, Windermere. In 1872 he went up to University College, Oxford, where in 1876 he won the Lothian prize and obtained a first in Greats. More importantly, at Oxford he met and fell under the spell of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24291/', "John Ruskin")</script>. He attended Ruskin's lectures and breakfasts, and helped build Ruskin's road at Hinksey. In his introduction to Collingwood's <span class="italic">Limestone Alps of Savoy</span>, Ruskin was later to describe him as &#145;one of the best and dearest of those Oxford pupils&#146;, and during the summer of 1873 Collingwood, with his father, visited Ruskin at Brantwood, Coniston. Two years later Collingwood was staying at Brantwood with Alexander Wedderburn, translating Xenophon's <span class="italic">Economist</span> for Ruskin's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca pastorum</span>, and helping with the enlargement of the harbour there. Ruskin admired his draughtsmanship, and on leaving Oxford, Collingwood went to the Slade to study, between 1876 and 1878, under Alphonse Legros; he exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1880.<br>
<br>The succeeding years were dedicated to helping Ruskin. Collingwood stayed at Brantwood in 1881 as his assistant and travelled with him in the following year to Switzerland, where he filled his sketchbooks with details of French and Italian sculpture and collected material for his <span class="italic">Limestone Alps of Savoy</span>, published in 1884 as a supplement to Ruskin's <span class="italic">Deucalion</span>. Meanwhile, in 1883 he had already published his <span class="italic">Philosophy of Ornament</span>. That same year he married Edith Mary Isaac (1857&#150;1928) and settled at Gillhead, though in 1891 he moved to Lanehead, Coniston, to be even nearer to Ruskin. In this decade he edited a number of Ruskin's texts: <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1891), <span class="italic">Studies in both Arts</span> and <span class="italic">Poetry of Architecture</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Verona and other Lectures</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">Lectures on Landscape</span> (1897). His biography of Ruskin, published in 1893 and rewritten in 1900, became a standard work, but after Ruskin's death in 1900 Collingwood declined to edit the Ruskin <span class="roman">Library Edition</span> because he saw it as a mere money-making venture by Ruskin's executors. However, he arranged Ruskin exhibitions in Coniston (1900 and 1919), London (1901), and Manchester (1904).<br>
<br>In 1896 Arthur Ransome first met the Collingwoods and their children, Dora 
    (<i>b</i>. 1886, later Mrs Ernest Altounyan)
  , Barbara 
    (<i>b</i>. 1887, later Mrs Oscar Gnosspelius)
  , Ursula 
    (<i>b</i>. 1891, later Mrs Reginald Luard Selby)
  , and Robin (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32503/', "Robin George Collingwood")</script>, the historian and philosopher). An excursion in the Collingwoods' boat <i>Swallow</i> was followed by a firm friendship, and much later, after teaching Collingwood's grandchildren to sail in <i>Swallow II</i>, Ransome's <span class="italic">Swallows and Amazons</span> series resulted. Partly because of lack of income, Collingwood and his wife educated their children at home for their early years.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Collingwood found his vocation as a painter and also became drawn into the group of men studying Lake District history. He joined the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society in 1887 and wrote a large number of papers for its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>; he became editor in 1900, a post which he nominally relinquished in 1920 on being nominated the society's president. Collingwood was particularly interested in Norse lore and the Norsemen in Lakeland, and he wrote a series of novels, including <span class="italic">Thorstein of the Mere</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">The Bondwoman</span> (1896), against this background. In 1897 he visited Iceland for three months, and two years later published, with Jon Stefansson, his <span class="italic">Pilgrimage to the Sagasteads of Iceland</span>. He was a member of the Viking Club and served as its president. Adverse criticism of <span class="italic">The Bondwoman</span> directed Collingwood's interests to a more intensive study of Norse and Anglican archaeology in the north, particularly the artistic aspect of it, on which he became widely recognized as the leading authority. Following Ruskin's death Collingwood continued to help for a while with secretarial work at Brantwood, but in 1905 he went to University College, Reading, as master of drawing and painting, and served as professor of fine art from 1907 until 1911.<br>
<br>Collingwood was sixty at the outbreak of the war; he joined the Admiralty intelligence division, but life in London did not improve his health. He returned to Coniston in 1919. He was vice-president of the Lakes Artists Society from its formation in 1903, and he and his wife regularly exhibited at their shows. His writing continued with <span class="italic">Lake District History</span> (1925) and perhaps his most important work, <span class="italic">Northumbrian Crosses of the pre-Norman Age</span> (1927). The intense activity of Collingwood's life was taking its toll, and in 1927 he experienced the first of a series of strokes. His life was further saddened by the death of his wife in the following year. Collingwood's last task was the revision of his <span class="italic">Lake Counties</span>. Originally published in 1902, this highly regarded book had long been out of print and was reissued in 1932. Collingwood died on 1 October 1932 at Lanehead, Coniston, after a stroke and was buried four days later in Coniston churchyard, near to Ruskin whose monolithic memorial cross he had designed.<br>
<br>In stature Collingwood was short, broad-shouldered, and erect; his eyes, like Ruskin's, were bright and piercingly blue. He was great climber and swimmer, and a tireless walker into advanced age. A fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and an honorary member of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, the Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, the Alpine Club, and the Carlisle Society of Arts and Crafts, Collingwood was an artist of no mean accomplishment, a scholar of great versatility, and an accomplished musician. Few English scholars have been better versed in Scandinavian languages. His books in various fields remain standard works at the end of the twentieth century and continue to be reprinted.<br>
