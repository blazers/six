<span class="headword">Major,  John</span>  (1782&#150;1849), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was probably born at Duke Street, West Smithfield, London, the son of Samuel Major. His first business was a shop located in the gateway of St Bartholomew's Hospital, but he moved successively to Skinner Street, Great Russell Street, and Fleet Street. In 1813 he privately printed his own verse, <span class="italic">Rational Madness, a Song for the Lovers of Curious and Rare Books</span>, which was adapted to the tune of &#145;Liberty Hall&#146;. Having an extensive knowledge of bibliography, Major was heavily involved with the famous bibliophile and author Thomas Frognall Dibdin. When Dibdin in 1815 threatened to burn the remaining copies of the fourth volume of the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Spenceriana</span> because it was selling badly, Major took them on generous terms.<br>
<br>Major's contemporary the publisher Charles Knight noted that he was also a reprinter of &#145;beautiful and cheap&#146; standard works  (Knight, 1.277). His most famous publication, which he edited himself, was an illustrated edition of Izaak Walton's and Charles Cotton's <span class="italic">Complete Angler</span> in 1823; there were new editions in 1824, 1835, 1844, and 1847, with many reprints. His other publications included Walton's <span class="italic">Lives</span> (1825), Walpole's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span> (1826), Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span>, and Defoe's <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1830). Between 1825 and 1836 Major, a minor poet, frequently contributed rhyming commentaries on the politics of the day to the weekly newspaper <span class="italic">John Bull</span>. He published his own <span class="italic">A Poetical Description of Bartholomew Fair</span>, by &#145;One under a Hood&#146;, in 1837.<br>
<br>Major continued to support Dibdin's publications, subscribing for fifty copies of Dibdin's edition of Thomas &agrave; Kempis (1828), and publishing his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> (1836). However, according to Thomas Rees, in the mid-1830s Major began to accept bills for Dibdin's speculations which Dibdin failed to honour. This eventually caused his financial ruin and a period of mental illness. He struggled on for a few years, first at 29 St Martin's Court, Leicester Square (1838), and then at 6 Museum Street, Bloomsbury (1839). His own rhymed version of Dean Swift's <span class="italic">Advice to Servants</span> was published in 1843, and in conjunction with his son John Stenson Major, a composer and music teacher, he issued <span class="italic">The Pastoral Week</span>, in the style of Walton. On the recommendation of the Rt Hon. Thomas Grenville, Major obtained an asylum in the Charterhouse, where he prepared the last and finest edition of <span class="italic">The Complete Angler</span> (1847), and died on 9 January 1849.<br>
