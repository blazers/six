<span class="headword">Pakeman,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1614&#150;1691), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, at Easter 1631, later migrating to Clare College, where he was admitted on 1 June 1633; he graduated BA in 1634 and proceeded MA in 1637. He was then employed for some years as a proofreader in the king's print house, and with three others presented a petition protesting against deteriorating conditions of work and a reduction in pay, imposed by the customs farmers.<br>
<br>On 28 January 1643 Pakeman began his ministry at Little Hadham, Hertfordshire. He was one of sixty-three Hertfordshire ministers who petitioned the Lords on 24 July 1646, in protest against the growth of sects and of anti-Scottish sentiment, urging the establishment of presbyterian church government. On 13 August that year the county committee of Hertford was ordered to investigate the estates at Hadham of its sequestered minister, Thomas Paske, and Pakeman was named as a minister there. On 4 November 1646 Pakeman was nominated vicar of Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex; he was officiating there by September 1648. He had already married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1690), daughter of Andrew Studeley of Shrewsbury, for they had baptized seven children at Harrow by 1659 and a son, Thomas, matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 18 October 1662, aged seventeen.<br>
<br>After his ejection under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662 Pakeman seems at first to have remained at Harrow, and there &#145;had the instruction and boarding of several children of persons of quality&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.468). Soon, however, he moved to Brentford, where he continued to preach and to teach, with the assistance of Ralph Button, the former professor of geometry at Gresham College, who lived next door. Button was imprisoned under the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> but Pakeman escaped, finding shelter at the house of a Mrs Methwold in Brompton, near Knightsbridge. Here he continued as a preacher until finding more permanent accommodation in the household of Erasmus Smith, where, Calamy reports, he continued some years. Philip Henry recorded on 25 June 1672 a dinner at Stanwardine Hall, Shropshire, at which Pakeman and other ministers were present, and this may suggest he was sheltering with relations of his wife. In 1685 the family settled in London, where Pakeman attended the parish church of St Martin Outwich under its then minister, Richard Kidder, and sometimes received communion. Also in that year, when he was preaching at the house of his son Thomas both men were seized by the city marshal and fined by the lord mayor, Sir Henry Tulse. Pakeman moved in 1687 to Stratford, Essex, where he employed a schoolmaster at his own expense to teach poor children to read. He died in June 1691 aged seventy-seven, and was buried at St Martin Outwich on 8 July. His funeral sermon was preached by Kidder, who was soon to be instituted as bishop of Bath and Wells. In his will, dated 18 March 1691, Pakeman left land in and around Shrewsbury to his son, Timothy, and small sums to his daughters, Elizabeth Brise, Johanne Paulfreman, Anne Scadding, and Mary Abbott.<br>
