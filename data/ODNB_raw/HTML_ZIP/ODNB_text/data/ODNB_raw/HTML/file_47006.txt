<span class="headword">Foster,  William</span>  (1821&#150;1884), <span class="occ">worsted manufacturer and merchant</span>, was born on 2 February 1821, probably at Low Fold, Clayton, Queenshead (later Queensbury), near Bradford, Yorkshire, the eldest son of John Foster (1798&#150;1879), worsted cloth merchant, and his wife, Ruth (1801&#150;1882), daughter of Abraham Briggs; the Briggs family were farmers in Bradford. William obtained a modest but sound education at the local nonconformist academy of Joseph Hinchliffe at Horton House, Bradford, and in 1834 joined his father at Prospect House, Queensbury, in his successful business as a master manufacturer in the domestic worsted trade. From a warehouse adjoining Prospect House, pieces of worsted cloth, woven in the cottages of local hand-loom weavers, were stored before their sale at the piece halls of Bradford or Halifax. In the same year Abraham Briggs conveyed land to his son-in-law John Foster, including a farm at Black Dyke. From this farm the purpose-built spinning mill (opened in 1835) took its name, and became known as Black Dyke mills (later famous as the home of the brass band of that name). William's apprenticeship (1834&#150;42) familiarized him with all the processes of production, and when he came of age his father had every confidence in making him a full partner in the business.<br>
<br>For the next forty years Foster was the dominant figure in the affairs of the firm, which carried the name John Foster &amp; Son, in spite of the founder's subsequently taking three other sons into the business. By 1874 William had brought into the firm three sons from his first marriage, William Henry (<i>b</i>. 1848), Robert John (<i>b</i>. 1850), and Frederick Charles (<i>b</i>. 1851). They extended the wide range of commercial interests initiated by their father between 1842 and 1882. In addition to the manufacture of worsted cloth, the partnership at Black Dyke mills operated as merchants and bankers, as well as manufacturers of soap, tiles, coke, tar, and chemical dyestuffs. Profits also accrued from collieries, farms, brickworks, and building contracts.<br>
<br>It was, however, as a principal manufactory of worsted cloth made from cotton warps and alpaca or mohair wefts that Black Dyke mills gained an international reputation and generated massive wealth for William Foster and his family. The firm's growth during Foster's chairmanship is revealed in the extensive business archive discovered by E. M. Sigsworth, which shows that the number of spindles in use for spinning yarn was 3036 in 1842 and by 1889 had increased to 51,368. The number of power looms for weaving cloth increased from 61 in 1842 to 962 in 1875. Combing was the last sector of the worsted trade to be mechanized and the firm's six combing machines in 1852 increased gradually to fifty-seven by 1880. When the textile trade was subdued in 1880&#150;81 Foster founded a movement to promote the weaving of ladies' fashion garments from wool. It was patronized by leading society people, including the marquess of Salisbury and the countess of Bective, after whom it was named, and enjoyed a moderate success.<br>
<br>In addition to his widespread textile interests, Foster was quick to realize the importance of railways. By 1864 he was a director of the West Riding and Grimsby Railway, the sale of which he personally negotiated to the Great Northern Railway in 1865, and by virtue of which he became a director of that large and successful company. He founded and chaired the Bradford and Thornton Railway Company in 1870, and in 1872 he was invited to join the board of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company.<br>
<br>William Foster was first married in January 1848 to Emma Elizabeth (1828&#150;1865), daughter of Swithin Anderton, a leading Bradford manufacturer. During their seventeen-year marriage she gave birth to five sons and four daughters. From 1856 she and William lived at Harrowins House, a mansion erected by him in a commanding position at Queensbury. Foster's second marriage, in 1867, to Mary Ellen Hornby of Filey, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, produced six more children.<br>
<br>In 1862 Foster's father paid &pound;205,000 for a castle and an estate of nearly 11,000 acres at Hornby, near Lancaster. In 1878, shortly before his father's death, Foster and his second wife left Queensbury to live for a while at Hornby Castle, which became their permanent home in 1882. His landed estates in Lancashire (Hornby Castle) and west Yorkshire had a gross annual value of &pound;9098 by 1879. The Fosters took their place in the ranks of the landed gentry with further land purchases at Egton Hall (Whitby), Canwell Hall (Staffordshire), and Moor Park (Oxford). This transfer into the upper reaches of English society was reinforced by the marriages of most of William Foster's children to sons or daughters of the landed classes. Such upward social mobility was made possible by the enormous wealth created by the ever expanding manufactory at Black Dyke mills, one of the largest woollen textile mills in the world.<br>
<br>Foster's devotion to business matters did not preclude him from a career in public service. He sat for many years as a magistrate for Bradford, the West Riding, and Lancashire. He served as high sheriff of Lancashire in 1881, and deputy lord lieutenant of Yorkshire. A Liberal in politics, he declined to stand as the Liberal candidate for North West Lancashire in 1880 on health grounds. He became vice-president of the Bradford chamber of commerce and was a member of the Queensbury local board of health (1864&#150;73). A prominent freemason, he was also an active member of the Anglican church in Queensbury, financing extensions to Holy Trinity Church, and acting for twenty-five years as trustee and manager of the national school there.<br>
<br>Foster's interests included music (he was a member of the committee that organized the Bradford Subscription Concerts) and game shooting on the family estates. He was a regular churchgoer (twice on Sundays) and enjoyed wine in moderation. Portraits and diary entries  (Sigsworth, 355&#150;64) suggest that he was forthright and decisive, but approachable and understanding when the need arose, particularly with his children. Throughout middle age he was constantly pained and irritated by bowel ulcers, inclining him to depression and melancholy. Daily application of nitric acid for his condition and, ultimately, surgery of the bowel finally took their toll and he died at Hornby Castle on 8 February 1884, only two years after his retirement, and was buried on 13 February at Holy Trinity Church, Queensbury. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
