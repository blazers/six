<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Schnadhorst,  Francis</span>  (1840&#150;1900), <span class="occ">political organizer</span>, was born on 24 August 1840 in Birmingham, the younger son and second of the three children of John Edward Schnadhorst, a draper of German extraction, and his wife, Amelia (1807/8&#150;1872). His father died while he was still young and he was brought up by his mother and paternal grandfather, Andrew Schnadhorst, who owned a tailor's shop in Moor Street, Birmingham. He was educated at King Edward VI's Grammar School, Birmingham, and at the age of sixteen, following the death of his grandfather, he took charge of the family business.<br>
<br>Schnadhorst was brought up as a nonconformist and as a young man he acted as secretary to the Revd R. W. Dale, the pastor of Carr's Lane Congregational Church. Dale officiated at his marriage there, on 26 September 1865, to Mary Anne (1845/6&#150;1912), daughter of Edward Thomas, provision merchant. The alliance between nonconformity and radicalism was particularly close in Birmingham, so Schnadhorst joined the Birmingham Liberal Association soon after its formation in 1865 as a matter of course. He first became involved in the active work of the association in 1867, when he was elected vice-chairman and joint secretary of the St George's ward committee. In 1870, as secretary of the Central Nonconformist Committee he was engaged in educational reforms, especially with respect to endowed schools. In 1872 he served briefly on Birmingham town council, being elected to fill a casual vacancy in October only to be defeated at the municipal elections a month later, but by this time it was apparent that he was a talented organizer and in 1873 he was appointed full-time secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Association in succession to William Harris.<br>
<br>The Birmingham Liberal Association was already regarded as a model of efficiency, following the success of its &#145;vote as you are told&#146; campaign at the 1868 general election, which had secured the return of Liberal members for all of Birmingham's three seats, but Schnadhorst fine-tuned its organization to an even higher pitch. He quickly engineered the overthrow of the Conservative and Anglican majorities on the town council and the school board and put in place a political machine which carried all before it for well over a decade. This was the heyday of the &#145;Birmingham caucus&#146; and to its detractors Schnadhorst, with his Teutonic name and &#145;spectacled, sallow, sombre&#146; features, was the perfect embodiment of its sinister power.<br>
<br>In 1877 Schnadhorst was appointed part-time secretary of the newly formed National Liberal Federation (NLF), while retaining his post with the Birmingham Liberal Association. The work involved in the dual appointment eventually proved too onerous even for someone of his energy and dedication and in 1884 he resigned the Birmingham post to become full-time secretary of the NLF at a salary of &pound;800 per annum. Two years later the Liberal Party organized a national testimonial for him and over &pound;10,000 was raised.<br>
<br>In 1885 Schnadhorst was given a seat on the standing committee of the Liberal Central Association, the party headquarters, and in July 1886 he was appointed secretary of this body. He remained secretary of the NLF, thus becoming the link between the leadership and the constituency associations and hence the key figure in rebuilding the party following the split over Irish home rule and the defection of the Liberal Unionists. Schnadhorst's achievement in keeping the NLF Gladstonian rather than Chamberlainite in 1886 was of considerable importance to the Liberal Party. He reorganized the NLF to make it more responsive to the needs of local associations, so encouraging affiliations, and revolutionized the Central Association's conduct of elections, the improvements being reflected in a series of favourable by-election results at the end of the 1880s. The work of co-ordinating the activities of the NLF and the Central Association proceeded more slowly but some progress was made, most notably in candidate selection. In 1889 Schnadhorst's own candidature in Newcastle under Lyme was approved but he stood down in the following year because of ill health. In 1891 he secured a donation of &pound;5000 to the Liberal party from Cecil Rhodes, whom he visited in Kimberley, and details of which were later made public  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Oct 1891).<br>
<br>Schnadhorst's health continued to decline and within two years of masterminding the Liberal victory at the 1892 general election, so enabling Gladstone to form his fourth ministry, he resigned all his offices with the party. He had always been very highly-strung and eventually suffered a complete mental and physical breakdown before dying at The Priory, a private lunatic asylum in Roehampton, on 2 January 1900. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter.<br>
