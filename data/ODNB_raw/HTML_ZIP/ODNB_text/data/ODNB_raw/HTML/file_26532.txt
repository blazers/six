<span class="headword">Stirling, Sir  James</span>  (1791&#150;1865), <span class="occ">naval officer and colonial governor</span>, born at Drumpellier, Lanarkshire, was the fifth son of Andrew Stirling of Drumpellier and his wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26536/', "Sir Walter Stirling (1718&#150;1786)")</script>. He entered the navy in August 1803 and went out to the West Indies, where he joined the <i>Hercules</i> (74 guns), flagship of Sir John Thomas Duckworth. In 1805 he was in the <i>Glory</i>, flagship of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26529/', "Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling")</script>, at Calder's action off Cape Finisterre on 22 July. He continued with his uncle in the <i>Sampson</i>, and again in the <i>Diadem</i>, in which he served during the operations in the River Plate in 1807. He was promoted lieutenant on 12 August 1809, and in 1811 returned to the West Indies as flag-lieutenant to his uncle, who promoted him, on 19 June 1812, to command the sloop <i>Brazen</i>, in which for some months he cruised successfully off the mouths of the Mississippi. Still in the <i>Brazen</i> he was afterwards in Hudson's Bay, in the North Sea, on the coast of Ireland, and again in the Gulf of Mexico, and after the peace commanded her in the West Indies until 1818. On the special recommendation of the commander-in-chief he was promoted to post rank on 7 December 1818. He married, on 3 September 1823, her sixteenth birthday, Ellen (1807&#150;1874), third daughter of James Mangles of Woodbridge in Surrey, MP for Guildford 1832&#150;7. They had five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1826 Stirling was appointed to the <i>Success</i> and was sent to form a settlement in Raffles Bay, Torres Strait. For his success he was highly complimented by the commander-in-chief and by the government of New South Wales. His report of further explorations in 1827 determined the government to attempt a strategic settlement in Western Australia to forestall an announced French settlement. In October 1828 he was appointed by Sir George Murray, the colonial secretary and an old family friend, to command a party of intending colonists. The expedition sailed in spring 1829 and reached its destination in June. The sites of two towns, Fremantle and Perth, were marked out, and within four months of its foundation the colony had a population of 1300. Stirling returned to England in 1832 for two years, and was knighted in 1833. His commitment and ingenuity preserved the fledgeling colony during a decade of difficulties, many of which reflected the over-optimistic report of 1827. He was also given 100,000 acres of land, and remained committed to the colony for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Stirling remained governor of Western Australia until 1839, when the apparent imminence of a war with France, and disappointment at the lack of progress in the colony, led him to resign in order to return to active service. From 1840 to 1844 he commanded the <i>Indus</i> (78 guns) in the Mediterranean, and from 1847 to 1850 the <i>Howe</i> (120 guns) on the same station. On 8 July 1851 he was promoted rear-admiral, and served briefly as a lord of the Admiralty in February 1852. He was commander-in-chief in China and the East Indies from January 1854 to February 1856, during a complex period, involving large-scale piracy, the Taiping uprising, commercial negotiations, and war with Russia, which last scarcely interfered with the routine of the station. His colonizing experience, Russophobia, and fine sense of commercial opportunities led him to propose that Britain take control of China. This ambitious plan was ignored. He became vice-admiral on 22 August 1857, and admiral on 22 November 1862. He was a knight grand cross of the Redeemer of Greece. Stirling died at Woodbridge, near Guildford, Surrey, on 22 April 1865. His daughter Georgiana Janet married first <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27506/', "Sir Henry Tombs")</script> and second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26474/', "Sir Herbert Stewart")</script>. Although more enthusiastic and active than reflective and analytical, Stirling was a capable and effective naval officer, and played a vital role in the creation of Western Australia.<br>
