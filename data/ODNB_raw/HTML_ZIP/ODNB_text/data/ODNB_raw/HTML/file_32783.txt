<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Denniston,  Alexander Guthrie <span class="st"> [Alastair]</span></span>  (1881&#150;1961), <span class="occ">cryptanalyst and intelligence officer</span>, was born on 1 December 1881 at Greenock, the eldest child of James Denniston, a medical practitioner, and his wife, Agnes Guthrie. He was educated at Bowdon College, Cheshire, and at the universities of Bonn and Paris.<br>
<br>From 1906 to 1909 Denniston taught at Merchiston Castle School. He then went to teach foreign languages at the Royal Naval College at Osborne, Isle of Wight. A considerable athlete, he played hockey for Scotland in the pre-war Olympic games. When war broke out in 1914, he was one of the few men in the service of the Admiralty who were fluent in German, and he played a leading part in the hasty establishment of Room 40 OB. Taking its name from the office in which it operated (Room 40, Old Buildings, Admiralty), this organization intercepted, decrypted, and interpreted on behalf of the naval staff German and other enemy wireless and cable communications. For its wartime exploits&#151;and most of all, perhaps, for its success in decrypting the notorious Zimmermann telegram&#151;Room 40 OB subsequently became internationally known. The fame did not extend to Denniston, nor (though he was at the centre of the cryptanalytical process) did he contribute to the publicity on which it rested: he was by nature reticent, and in 1919 he had been selected to lead the country's peacetime cryptanalytical effort as head of the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS). In 1917 Denniston married Dorothy Mary Gilliat, who worked at the time with him in Room 40 OB. She was the daughter of Arthur Gilliat, a businessman; they had one son and one daughter. Their son, Robin, made his career in publishing and became the academic publisher at Oxford University Press.<br>
<br>Denniston served as the operational head of GCCS from 1919 to February 1942. He supervised its formation as a small interdepartmental organization of twenty-five people recruited from Room 40 OB and its equivalent section in the War Office, MI1B. It included defectors from Russia, linguists, and talented amateurs of all kinds. Denniston, appointed CBE in 1933, presided over its slow inter-war expansion. In those years it had to cope with the continuously increasing sophistication of cipher security and with a decline in wireless communications, as well as with a shortage of funds. Yet he succeeded in the important task of preserving continuity of expertise and experience, and also presided over GCCS's rapid expansion and transfer to Bletchley Park on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.<br>
<br>In 1937 Denniston had begun to recruit a number of dons who were to join GCCS on the outbreak of war. His contacts with academics who had been members of Room 40 OB helped him to choose such men as Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman, who subsequently led the attack on Wehrmacht Enigma. Denniston's foresight, and his wise selection of the new staff, who for the first time included mathematicians, were the basis for many of GCCS's outstanding wartime successes, especially against Enigma. In the first half of 1940 Denniston had the satisfaction of knowing that, reinforced by the wartime staff which he had recruited and with the aid of vital information supplied by Polish cryptanalysts who had solved Wehrmacht Enigma many years earlier, GCCS was beginning to solve the problem which had most stubbornly defied all its efforts. This was the problem posed by Germany's adoption of the Enigma cipher machine in various versions for the secret communications of the armed forces, the railways, the secret service, and other government organizations.<br>
<br>Yet Denniston knew that GCCS could not hope to tackle the ciphers of the axis powers on its own. From early 1941 onwards he strove to promote full co-operation between GCCS and the United States' army and navy code-breaking units, urging the Americans to attack Japanese traffic, with GCCS concentrating on German and Italian signals. Although some senior figures both inside and outside GCCS were initially very reluctant to share GCCS's Enigma secrets with the Americans, his views were implemented in the Holden agreement of October 1942 on naval ciphers and the BRUSA (Britain&#150;United States of America) agreement of May 1943 on the army, air force, and secret service ciphers of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Both Britain and America benefited immeasurably from the resulting co-operation, which later led to similar far-ranging post-war agreements between the two countries.<br>
<br>GCCS achieved a substantial mastery of Enigma in the second half of 1941, reading from then until the end of the war many of the ciphers it employed. In the course of doing so, it increased its staff from about 200 in September 1939 to 10,500 (including its out-stations in England) by January 1945. GCCS also encountered new administrative requirements, and to an ever greater extent came to rely for its operation on specialized apparatus and machinery. Although Denniston recognized that these developments called for a major reorganization, he was not himself the man to carry it out: he had always been a reluctant administrator, preferring to concentrate on technical matters. Nor was he forceful enough in pressing GCCS's case for priority in obtaining junior staff and vital code-breaking machinery. In October 1941 four cryptanalysts, including Turing and Welchman, became so frustrated with the resulting delays in breaking Enigma that they appealed for help directly to Winston Churchill, who immediately ordered that they were to &#145;have all they want on extreme priority&#146;  (minute, 22 Oct 1941, TNA: PRO, HW 1/155). A reorganization in February 1942 divided GCCS into a services and a civil, and much smaller, wing, which had only about 250 staff (including its commercial section) by March 1944. As head of the services division Denniston was succeeded by Commander Edward W. Travis; he himself, having been appointed CMG in 1941, remained the head of the civil division, moving to London (to above Madame Rich&eacute;, &#145;couturier des dames&#146; in Berkeley Street), where, on seven floors, he and his team dealt with the diplomatic traffic of Germany, Italy, Japan, and many neutral countries&#151;the commercial section, which had fifty staff in May 1943, worked in the nearby Aldford House.<br>
<br>The department worked eighteen hours a day, seven days a week, and achieved many successes. Colonel Alfred McCormack, the influential deputy head of the US army's special branch, which supervised signal intelligence in the US war department, was extremely impressed by Berkeley Street during a lengthy visit to GCCS in 1943. He informed the department that it would be &#145;absolutely astonished&#146; by the &#145;resources of intelligence &hellip; here in Denniston's show, waiting for somebody to tap them&#146;  (cable 4952, 2 June 1943, &#145;Colonel McCormack's trip to London&#146;). Denniston, continuing his policy of co-operating fully with the United States, had &#145;turned his people over to us [McCormack's team] for questioning and given us a free run of his place&#146; more than anybody else in GCCS  (&#145;Conversations with Denniston&#146;, <span class="roman">Colonel McCormack's trip to London</span>, 63). Although Denniston was bitterly disappointed at no longer being sole head of GCCS, he headed the Berkeley Street section most effectively. He retired in 1945 and thereafter taught French and Latin at a Leatherhead preparatory school.<br>
<br>Throughout his long period of office as operational head of an undivided GCCS, directly responsible to the chief of the secret service, Denniston brought unusual distinction and expertise, as well as devotion, to his work. If he had little liking for questions of administration, he had even less for the ways of bureaucracy and the demands of hierarchy. By his willingness to delegate, his trust in subordinates, his informality, and his charm he set his stamp on the character of the place, particularly in the early war years in Bletchley Park. More than any other man, he helped it to maintain both the creative atmosphere which underlay its great contribution to British intelligence during the Second World War and the complete security which was no less an important precondition of its achievement.<br>
<br>Alastair Denniston, as he was known, was a small man, with a strong, craggy-featured face&#151;indeed, colleagues referred to him as &#145;the little man&#146;. With his athletic figure, he was always very neatly turned out. He died at the Memorial Hospital, Milford-on-Sea, Hampshire, on 1 January 1961.<br>
