<span class="headword">Eversden,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1294&#150;1315), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and chronicler</span>, derived his surname from either Great Eversden or Little Eversden, villages near Caxton in Cambridgeshire. At an unknown date he became a monk of Bury St Edmunds, and by 1294 was kitchener and by 1296 cellarer, holding the latter office for about twenty years. The thirteenth-century chronicle of Bury St Edmunds Abbey records that in 1299 John Eversden, cellarer, stayed at the cellarer's manor of Warkton (near Kettering in Northamptonshire), endeavouring to obtain the manor's disafforestment. The chronicle records that he was successful and that he visited Warkton again the next year, this time defending the abbey's right to a certain pasture. In 1302 Eversden was one of the six delegates chosen by the monks to elect their new abbot, and he was the delegate chosen to announce the election of Thomas Tottington to the rest of the convent. In 1306&#150;7 he was one of Abbot Thomas's two proctors at the parliament in Carlisle, and again in 1309 at the parliament at Westminster. The abbey's registers have a number of entries for the period between November 1296 and November 1315 recording some of Eversden's other activities, mainly on business relating to the cellarer's office.<br>
<br>Eversden was evidently a monk of some, but not outstanding, importance. He owes his subsequent reputation to the attribution to his authorship of part of the Bury chronicle. This originated as a chronicle from the creation of the world to 1265 by the Bury monk, John of Taxster (<i>d</i>. 1265). Some time before the end of the 1270s Taxster's chronicle was revised at Bury. This new recension survives complete in only two copies, London, College of Arms, Arundel MS 30, and West Suffolk Record Office, MS A 8/1, both of the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century. The text has significant variants from Taxster's work. For instance, it omits the notice under 1244 that Taxster took the habit in that year, and a notice under 1264 about the siege of Gloucester by the Lord Edward, but adds to Taxster's narrative a note (an addition, not by the original scribe in Arundel MS 30 but incorporated in MS A 8/1) under 1255 <i>hic attonsus fui</i>, and a paragraph under 1264 about the fine of 800 marks imposed on Bury St Edmunds Abbey by the parliament at Winchester. This revised version of Taxster's chronicle was the basis of two continuations, to 1296 and 1301 respectively, both valuable sources for Edward I's reign. The 1265&#150;96 continuation was borrowed from by chroniclers in a number of monasteries, most of them in East Anglia: Bartholomew Cotton (<i>d</i>. 1321/2) at Norwich, the chronicler known as John of Oxnead at St Benet of Hulme, and the Peterborough chronicler were especially indebted to it. This continuation, together, with the revised version of Taxster's chronicle, is the section of the Bury chronicle usually attributed to John Eversden, who, it has been supposed, was the monk whose tonsuring the chronicle records under 1255.<br>
<br>The reason for the chronicle's attribution to Eversden is to be found in Arundel MS 30. This manuscript is of Bury provenance and contains, besides the chronicle, a miscellaneous collection of treatises and notes, in various thirteenth- and fourteenth-century hands. It has the best, and only complete, copy of the 1265&#150;96 continuation, and the unique copy of the 1296&#150;1301 continuation. In the margin by the passage recording Eversden's expeditions to Warkton in 1299 and 1300 is a sketch of the head of a man&#151;apparently a rustic&#151;hooded. Arundel MS 30 was once owned by the antiquary and bibliographer John Bale (<i>d</i>. 1563). Quite possibly it was because of the above reference to Eversden in the text that Bale attributed the whole Bury chronicle to him. Bale may also have supposed that the marginal sketch represented Eversden. Until the twentieth century scholars concurred with the attribution in so far as it referred to the 1265&#150;96 continuation, although Liebermann in 1888 pointed out that the known evidence for Eversden's authorship is extremely weak. Then in 1943 V. H. Galbraith reiterated Liebermann's doubts, and further research has yielded nothing to substantiate the attribution. Bale attributed four other works, besides the chronicle, to Eversden, copies of all of which are in Arundel 30. Nothing is known to corroborate these attributions. It would seem that Bale, having attributed the chronicle in Arundel MS 30 to Eversden, concluded that these other works in the manuscript must likewise have been by him.<br>
