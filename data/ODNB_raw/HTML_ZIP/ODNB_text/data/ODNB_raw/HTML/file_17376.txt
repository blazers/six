<span class="headword">MacCarthy,  Cormac  Oge Laidhir</span>, lord of Muskerry  (<em>d.</em> 1536), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was the son of Cormac MacCarthy, lord of Muskerry (<i>d</i>. 1495), and Mary, daughter of Edmund Fitzmaurice, baron of Lixnaw. In 1498 Cormac Oge killed his uncle E&oacute;ghan MacCarthy, lord of Muskerry, who three years earlier had killed his father and taken over the lordship. In this he was aided by his brother-in-law Thomas fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, subsequently eleventh earl of Desmond, the two proving firm allies and important actors in Munster's political history in the early sixteenth century. In 1501 Cormac Oge became lord of Muskerry. He continued to be involved in events outside his lordship and participated in the expedition led by the lord deputy, Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare, against Teige O'Brien of Thomond in 1510. In 1516 he joined with his brother-in-law Thomas in support of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, subsequently tenth earl of Desmond, then in conflict with John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, subsequently twelfth <i>de facto</i> earl of Desmond. In 1520, however, they sided against James, who had succeeded as tenth earl earlier that year, and inflicted a very heavy defeat on him at the battle of Mourne, co. Cork. Cormac and Thomas again attacked James in December 1527 when they joined Piers Butler, earl of Ormond, in besieging him at Dungarvan.<br>
<br>Thomas fitz Thomas succeeded as eleventh earl of Desmond in 1529, and when he died five years later Cormac supported Thomas's grandson and heir <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9561/', "James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, twelfth de jure earl")</script>, who was married to Cormac's daughter Mary. He provided James with military support and wrote to Henry VIII on his behalf in 1535, but James was opposed by the majority of the Desmond Geraldines and was in England by the following year. Cormac met Lord Lieutenant Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, at Waterford in 1520 and appeared willing to hold his lands of the crown, but nothing came of the meeting.<br>
<br>Cormac Oge married Katherine, daughter of John, Lord Barry, with whom he apparently had at least five sons: Tadhg, who succeeded as lord of Muskerry (<i>d</i>. 1565), Diarmuid, E&oacute;ghan, Ceallach&aacute;n, and Cormac; there were also at least three daughters: Julia (Shely, Cicely), Ellen (Joan), and Mary. He died in 1536 and was buried at Kilcrea, co. Cork.<br>
