<span class="headword">Morley,  Muriel Elizabeth</span>  (1899&#150;1993), <span class="occ">speech therapist</span>, was born on 20 February 1899 at The Wells, Skircoat, Halifax, Yorkshire, the eldest daughter of Samuel Edwin Morley, a boiler composition manufacturer, and his wife, Helen Ann Monk, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fletcher. Morley was educated at Halifax and Monkseaton high schools, then read physics and biology at Armstrong College, a division of the University of Durham located in Newcastle upon Tyne. She graduated in 1920 with a BSc and a certificate of education. She taught physics at the Church high school in Newcastle for ten years and then took a teaching post in India. While in India she contracted dysentery and, on her return to England, was advised that she was no longer strong enough for work in the classroom.<br>
<br>Thus forced into a change of career, after a period working as a secretary, in 1932 Morley responded to an advertisement placed by William Wardell, a Newcastle plastic surgeon. Wardell had developed a new type of pharyngoplasty for children with cleft palate and wanted an &#145;educated woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>) to assess the children's speech before and after surgery in order to determine the effectiveness of the operation. Morley, who had not even heard of the profession of speech therapy before applying for the post, was appointed and immediately immersed herself in her new job, reading everything available on the subject of cleft palate and also learning photography as a useful adjunct to her work. The work interested her immensely and she became a leading authority of international repute in this field. After some five years, patients with disorders of speech other than cleft palate were referred to her and she realized that she needed to further her knowledge. Unable to afford the part-time speech therapy training that was available in London, she devised her own scheme. This included working with speech therapy colleagues in hospital and school clinics in Liverpool and London. Her efforts were rewarded when she gained the diploma of the British Society of Speech Therapists in 1938.<br>
<br>Now qualified, Morley was, in 1939, appointed as a speech therapist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. Initially she worked for just two sessions a week at the rate of 1 guinea per session and spent her spare time preparing a thesis on cleft palate. Her thesis, later the basis for her book <span class="italic">Cleft Palate and Speech</span>, was passed in April 1939 and she gained membership of the British Society of Speech Therapists; its members were admitted to the College of Speech Therapists, founded in 1945. The book gave thorough descriptions of the anatomy of cleft palate, surgery, associated speech problems, and practical suggestions for treatment. Published in 1945, it became a standard work in this field.<br>
<br>It was during the early 1940s that people became increasingly aware of speech therapy and the profession gained more recognition. By 1945 Morley had set up Newcastle's hospital speech therapy service and was working full-time as a therapist in three hospitals, treating people with a variety of speech and language disorders, including former servicemen suffering from dysphasia as a result of head injuries sustained during the Second World War. Morley's practice grew apace and she was obliged to involve parents in their children's treatment in order to enable her to treat her ever-burgeoning caseload. She soon recognized the benefits of this, however, and became an exponent of parental involvement in speech therapy.<br>
<br>Between 1950 and 1953 Morley's department researched into the normal and abnormal development of speech in a group of over 1000 children as part of the Newcastle family survey. In 1957 she published part of this study together with examples of her work in multidisciplinary clinics as <span class="italic">The Development and Disorders of Speech in Childhood</span>. This work was regarded as a landmark in speech pathology in the USA and it was on the basis of this book that she was awarded the degree of DSc by the University of Durham in 1958.<br>
<br>Morley made the first of many visits to the USA in 1951, finding that the standard of clinical work was below that of the UK but that academically the training was more extensive. In the hope that a university degree course might &#145;convince those concerned of the true status of the profession&#146;  (Morley, 3), she eventually persuaded the university in Newcastle, still then part of the University of Durham, to investigate the possibility of setting up such a degree. Her idea was finally realized in 1959 and Morley delayed her retirement, due at this time, in order to establish the course. She was appointed lecturer in speech and speech pathology in the departments of child health and education. Morley eventually retired in 1963 from what was by then the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>Morley's contribution to the speech therapy profession was considerable. In addition to her pioneering clinical work, her professional philosophy that language and speech must be taught in universities and that studies of speech pathology must always be based on sound knowledge of normal behaviours, was innovative at the time. She strove to convince people within the profession of the need for research into the origins and treatment of speech disorders and those outside it of the importance of speech therapy. Morley joined the ultimately successful campaign against registration under the <span class="roman">Bill for Professions Supplementary to Medicine</span> because she was convinced that the profession, in order to survive, must exist as a discipline completely separate from general medicine. She also wrote numerous articles concerning speech disorders and their treatment.<br>
<br>As a member of the College of Speech Therapists, Morley served many terms on the council as a fellow's representative and served as its third president from 1971 to 1973. In retirement she edited the college journal from 1967 to 1973, effecting significant changes and encouraging international distribution and contributions for the first time. She forged strong links with the speech therapy professions in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA, where she travelled widely as a visiting professor. She was involved in achieving reciprocal recognition of speech therapy qualifications with the USA and was made an honorary member of the American Cleft Palate Association and honorary fellow of the Australian College of Speech Therapists.<br>
<br>Morley was appointed OBE in 1980 in acknowledgement of her pioneering work in research and education in speech therapy. Donald Court, professor of child health at Newcastle and her former colleague, described Morley in 1984 as a &#145;remarkable woman&#146; who was &#145;fuelled and directed by her unwavering belief in the value of her subject and an unyielding commitment to its practice at the highest level&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
<br>For the last thirty years of her life, Morley lived in Northumberland, a place she loved. The photography that she originally learned as part of her cleft palate work remained a lifelong hobby; she also enjoyed painting with oils, baking, making carpets and tapestry kneelers, gardening, sewing, and knitting. Muriel Morley never married but was devoted to her family. She died of bronchopneumonia on 15 September 1993 at Greenfields, Powburn, Alnwick, Northumberland.<br>
