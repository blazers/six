<span class="headword">Bedyngham,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1459/60), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown parentage and birth, though his name suggests a family of Norfolk origins. A hypothesis that he is identical with John Bodenham (1422&#150;1458), scholar and fellow of New College, Oxford, has not won general acceptance. Bedyngham left a small but distinguished body of secular and sacred music. Apart from three mathematically intricate proportional puzzle motets, his works are known almost entirely from manuscripts compiled on the continent of Europe. This may suggest that he travelled, as does his composing a chanson mass, but the presence of texts in foreign languages among his songs is by no means conclusive evidence for this, since in many cases it can be shown that the words are not original; and the marked propensity of foreign copyists to ascribe his works to more famous masters suggests that he was not personally known to them.<br>
<br>Bedyngham's music, especially his secular songs, survives in a surprising number of different manuscripts. He probably composed the famous setting of Giustinian's &#145;O rosa bella&#146; commonly ascribed to John Dunstaple  (Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, &#145;Chansonnier de Jean de Montchenu&#146;, MS Rothschild 2973 (I.5.13), fols. 8<i>v</i>&#150;10<i>r</i>, item 7). The song does not observe the niceties of the ballata form. The eight songs attributable to Bedyngham are between them supplied with no fewer than twenty different texts in four languages; three remain doubtful as to their form, but two are ballades and three rondeaux, types well known and widely practised in England at the time.<br>
<br>Expertise in the medium of song may have led Bedyngham to become one of the first composers, along with Walter Frye and Guillaume Dufay, to experiment with the technique of building a mass cycle not on plainchant, but on a model taken from secular music. There is a remarkable cycle on Gilles Binchois's ballade &#145;Deuil angoisseux&#146;, in which material from all voices of the song informs other parts than the tenor alone  (Trento, Castello del Buonconsiglio, Monumenti e Collezioni Provinciali, MS 1375, fols. 27<i>v</i>&#150;31<i>r</i> and 17<i>v</i>&#150;21<i>r</i>). Two other masses (one of doubtful attribution) are hardly less distinguished. In turn, Bedyngham's own songs served as models on which other composers based mass cycles, including three on &#145;O rosa bella&#146;.<br>
<br>Bedyngham appears to have spent the last seven years of his life in Westminster. By Michaelmas 1453 he was in the employ of the lady chapel of Westminster Abbey, while by May 1456 he had become verger to the collegiate church of St Stephen, Westminster, a post he still held in 1457&#150;8, when he made over all his property to others by letters patent. The membership list of the Confraternity of St Nicholas, the London guild of parish clerks, of which he was already a member in 1449, reveals that Bedyngham died between 3 May 1459 and 22 May 1460.<br>
