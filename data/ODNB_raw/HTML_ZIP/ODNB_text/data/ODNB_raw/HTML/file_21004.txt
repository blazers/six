<span class="headword">Owen,  Henry Charles  Cunliffe-</span>  (1821&#150;1867), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of Captain Charles Cunliffe-Owen RN, from the ancient family of Cunliffe of Wycoller, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 3 May 1841), daughter of Sir Henry Blosset, kt, chief justice of Bengal, was born at Lausanne, Switzerland, on 16 October 1821. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20997/', "Sir Francis Philip Cunliffe-Owen (1828&#150;1894)")</script> was his brother. He was educated privately and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, obtaining a commission as second-lieutenant, Royal Engineers, on 19 March 1839. After the usual Chatham course, he went to Devonport. In January 1841 he was sent to Mauritius. On 30 September he was promoted lieutenant. In January 1845 he was ordered to the Cape of Good Hope, where he took part in the campaign against the rebel Boers and in the Cape Frontier War of 1846&#150;7, and was thanked for his services in general orders. On 28 October 1847 he was promoted second-captain. He returned to England in April 1848 and was stationed at Devonport, then at Chatham, until, in November 1850, he was permitted to accept an appointment under the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 as computer of space for the United Kingdom, and later as superintendent of the foreign departments, and finally, after the exhibition was opened, as its general superintendent. Cunliffe-Owen's courtesy, firmness, and business habits won him most favourable opinions. When the exhibition closed Cunliffe-Owen was appointed inspector of art schools in the department of practical art, then under the Board of Trade, with offices at Marlborough House. He was elected an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 3 February 1852.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Crimean War, Cunliffe-Owen resigned his civil appointment, and in January 1855 he joined the army before Sevastopol. Severely wounded by a musket ball, he lost his leg and was invalided home. He was mentioned in dispatches, made a CB (February 1856), given a pension of &pound;100 per annum, appointed officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and received the Mejidiye (5th class). On 17 July 1855 he was promoted brevet major.<br>
<br>In October 1855 Cunliffe-Owen was appointed assistant inspector-general of fortifications at the War Office, and in April 1856 deputy inspector-general of fortifications under Sir John Fox Burgoyne. The latter post he held until August 1860, when he was appointed commanding royal engineer of the western district. He had been promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 6 June 1856, and on 22 November 1861 he was promoted brevet colonel. On 1 April 1862 he became a regimental lieutenant-colonel. During his command in the western district were begun the important land and sea fortifications for the defence of Devonport, converting the place into a first-class fortress, as well as the defences of the Severn at Breandown and at Steep and Flat Holmes, which were also in his district. The Plymouth defences absorbed most of Cunliffe-Owen's time and attention, and it was while inspecting some of these works that he caught a chill, from the effects of which he died.<br>
<br>Cunliffe-Owen married in 1855, in London, Agnes, daughter of Lewis Cubitt; they had a son, Edward, born on 1 January 1857. His widow married, in 1872, the Revd Henry Edward Willington. Cunliffe-Owen was a good man: popular, charming, a pleasant companion, a hard worker, and devoted to his profession. He was a high-churchman, a friend of Pusey, and one of the founders of the English Church Union (1860). He contributed on fortification to the <span class="italic">Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers</span>. Cunliffe-Owen died at his home, 3 Leigham Terrace, Plymouth, on 7 March 1867, and was buried in Plymouth cemetery. A memorial window was placed in St James's Church, Plymouth.<br>
