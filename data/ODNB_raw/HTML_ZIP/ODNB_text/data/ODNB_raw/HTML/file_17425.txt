<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Alexander</span>  (1791?&#150;1850), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was employed at an early age as a clerk in the General Register House, Edinburgh, where he assisted Thomas Thomson in the preparation of <span class="italic">Acts of the Scottish Parliament</span> and other works. In 1824 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and in 1836 he was joint curator of the society's museum. For some years he had acted as curatorial assistant to James Skene, and had played an important part in the transfer of the society's collections to its new rooms in the Royal Institution building at the Mound. In 1836 he was appointed principal keeper of the register of deeds and probate writs or protests at Register House.<br>
<br>Macdonald is said to have supplied a considerable amount of the material for Sir Walter Scott's notes to the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels. Certainly it was his custom to provide scholars and men of letters with historical material extracted from the records in his care. In 1829, for instance, he transcribed for Scott lengthy extracts from the <span class="roman">Orderly Book</span> of the duke of Cumberland's army in Scotland in 1745&#150;6; and Scott indeed incorporated portions of this in <span class="italic">Tales of a Grandfather</span>. (Macdonald's manuscript is in the National Library of Scotland.) Earlier, in 1825, Scott had stated that nothing could be more civil than the way Macdonald was superintending the work of gathering source material on King James VI and I. An invitation from Scott to Abbotsford in 1829 was clearly a great event in Macdonald's life. That year he had found an amanuensis for Scott. Many scholars acknowledged their debt to him. As Robert Chambers put it in 1826, by his assistance to him and to others Macdonald helped to advance the &#145;invaluable cause of antiquarian literature&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 3134, 219).<br>
<br>It was, however, as editor of the publications of the Maitland Club that Macdonald rendered most service to historical research. The volumes edited by him were: <span class="italic">The Register of Ministers, Exhorters, and Readers of the Church of Scotland</span> (1830); <span class="italic">Maitland Club Miscellany</span> (vols. 1 and 2, 1834); Adam Blackwood's <span class="italic">History of Mary, Queen of Scots</span> (1834); and <span class="italic">Report on the State of Certain Parishes in Scotland</span> (1835). He also edited <span class="italic">Letters to King James the Sixth</span> (1835), <span class="italic">Papers Relative to the Royal Guard of Scottish Archers in France</span> (1835), and <span class="italic">Letters to the Argyll Family</span> (1839). For the Bannatyne Club he edited <span class="italic">Registrum honoris de Morton</span>, published posthumously in 1853. Macdonald died at Edinburgh on 23 December 1850, aged about fifty-nine. His library at 5 Regent Terrace, rich in works on Scottish history and related matters, was sold by Tait and Nisbet on 7 May 1851.<br>
