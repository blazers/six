<span class="headword">Hook,  Walter Farquhar</span>  (1798&#150;1875), <span class="occ">dean of Chichester</span>, was born on 13 March 1798 in Conduit Street, London, the eldest child of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13684/', "Revd James Hook (1772?&#150;1828)")</script> and his wife, Anne Farquhar. His early childhood was spent at his father's rectory of Hertingfordbury.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>At the age of nine Hook was sent with his only brother, Robert, to Dr Michael Henry Thornhill Luscombe's school at Hertford, and two years later to Tiverton School, where the discipline was severe but the teaching indifferent. In 1812 he was entered as a commoner at Winchester College, where he formed his lifelong friendship with William Page Wood. Although weak at both formal scholarship and games, he acquired at Winchester a deep love for the works of Shakespeare and Milton, and his physical strength ensured that he was never bullied. Indeed, he retained his substantial and robust physique for the rest of his life. By working diligently he passed the examination to enter the sixth form, and twice won the silver medal for speech-day recitations.<br>
<br>In 1817 Hook's grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9181/', "Sir Walter Farquhar (1738&#150;1819)")</script>, obtained a nomination for him from the prince regent to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford. Here he had an undistinguished career, leading a rather isolated and reclusive life, with little interest in the formal course of studies; he became a keen reader of the works of Sir Walter Scott, and made his first, rather tentative, contacts with some of the future leaders of the Oxford Movement, such as E. B. Pusey and J. H. Newman. His failure in 1821 to win the Newdigate prize for an English poem, the only university honour which he tried to obtain, was a great disappointment to him, and he was glad to leave Oxford after graduating BA in 1821. He subsequently obtained his MA in 1824, and his BD and DD in 1837.<br>
<br>This life of comparative indolence changed completely after Hook's ordination as deacon on 30 September 1821. He now acquired a sense of purpose and direction that had previously been absent, and his time as his father's curate from 1821 to 1825 at Whippingham in the Isle of Wight was spent in an intensive programme of study. He built a small hut for himself where he spent up to ten hours a day working through a detailed reading plan of church history and theology, which confirmed his high-church interpretation of Anglicanism. His ideas were clearly outlined in his first published sermon in 1822, and at Christmas that year he was ordained priest. At the same time he discovered a talent for pastoral work. In the village of East Cowes, some 2 miles from the rectory and with no church of its own, Hook improvised Sunday evening services in a sail-loft, and for the first time in his life came into intimate contact with working people.<br>
<br>This growing self-confidence was demonstrated in 1825 when Hook's former schoolmaster, Dr Luscombe, pointed to the absence of episcopal supervision for the scattered Anglican congregations on the continent. After the initial proposal of a suffragan to the bishop of London was rejected for constitutional reasons, it was Hook who pointed to the precedent of the Scottish Episcopal church consecrating the first bishop for the American republic in 1785. His idea was adopted, and on 20 March 1825 Dr Luscombe was himself consecrated at Stirling, Hook preaching the sermon. This was subsequently published as <span class="italic">An attempt to demonstrate the Catholicism of the Church of England and other branches of the episcopal church</span>, in form and content marking an advance in his thinking over the sermon of 1822. In May 1826 Hook defended the consecration of Luscombe in an article in the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span>, which further demonstrated his recently acquired command of church history.<br>
<br>With the departure of his father to the deanery of Worcester in 1825 Hook left Whippingham and was appointed perpetual curate of Moseley, near Birmingham. Here he established a village school and experienced the first opposition to his work from local evangelicals. His appointment to a lectureship at St Philip's, Birmingham, in 1827 enabled him to appoint a curate at Moseley, while he established a penitentiary in Birmingham.<h2>
<a name="VicarofCoventry"></a>Vicar of Coventry</h2>In 1828 Hook became vicar of Holy Trinity, Coventry, and it was here that he had his first contact with a large urban parish, an experience that was to prepare him for his later work in Leeds. He arrived at Coventry in a period of great economic distress among the textile workers of the town, with much consequent poverty, and from this point onwards Hook's ministry always combined spiritual revival with a strong social concern. By 1830 he had begun evening services, and in 1831 a course of lectures. When he arrived in Coventry there were only 120 children in the Sunday schools; by the time he left in 1837 there were 1200. He increased the frequency of holy communion, and founded a savings bank and the Religious and Useful Knowledge Society. In all this work he was now supported by his wife, Anna Delicia (<i>d</i>. 1871), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14968/', "Dr John Johnstone")</script>, whom he married on 4 June 1829. They had several children, the eldest son dying in 1836.<br>
<br>It was while Hook was at Coventry that the Oxford Movement gained momentum with the first of the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span> appearing in September 1833. His relationship to the Tractarians was often misunderstood at the time, and has sometimes been misinterpreted subsequently. Hook's theological position had been clearly formed in the years before the movement began, and, while he showed much sympathy with its earlier manifestations, distributing the tracts among his flock in Coventry, he also had some clear areas of disagreement with the movement's leaders, valuing the church establishment and its sixteenth-century Reformers more highly than many of them did. Over the years his reservations matured into distrust, especially with what he saw as the increasingly Roman tendencies of the more extreme members of the movement. Hook always remained a traditional high-churchman, and, unlike some of that persuasion such as Henry Newland, he never departed from his original views.<h2>
<a name="VicarofLeedsanddeanofChichester"></a>Vicar of Leeds and dean of Chichester</h2>In 1837 Hook became vicar of Leeds: it was his work there over the following twenty-two years as a pioneer in restoring the position of the Church of England in the new industrial towns that marked it as one of the most important parochial ministries of the nineteenth century. However, even before his formal election by the trustees, Hook encountered opposition in the form of a petition against his appointment signed by 400 of his future parishioners, and he was attacked in the local press as a Tractarian. At that time Leeds was a town of very decided protestant sympathies; as Hook himself wrote to Samuel Wilberforce in 1837: &#145;the <i>de facto</i> established religion is Methodism&#146;. Between 1770 and 1840 some twenty-two Wesleyan Methodist chapels had been founded in the outer townships of Leeds alone. In contrast in 1825 the Church of England had its parish church, thirteen chapels of ease, and only eighteen clergy, many of whom were non-resident, for a parish of 125,000 souls. It was a system which had proved unworkable in the eighteenth century, and was now totally inadequate for an industrial town of the nineteenth. In the years immediately before Hook's arrival in Leeds, Anglicans had lost control of the improvement commission in 1829 and of the town council following the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span> of 1835. In 1827 the nonconformist majority in the vestry had voted against any further payments towards the building of new Anglican churches, and by 1833 the majority of the churchwardens were nonconformists; not surprisingly the sums raised by the church rate fell from &pound;2611 in 1818, to &pound;614 in 1833, and from that latter year no further rate was raised.<br>
<br>Hook's achievements in Leeds fall into three broad areas. First of all, he largely overcame the suspicion and opposition which he faced in 1837; secondly, he reconstructed the material resources of the Church of England; and thirdly, he developed a new concept of pastoral mission for an urban community. Upon his arrival the ratepayers deliberately elected seven churchwardens hostile to him who refused to pay to replace the tattered surplices and service books. However, Hook's first success came as early as 19 August 1837, at a meeting in the Old Cloth Hall called to fix a church rate. He effectively found himself faced by a hostile mob of 3000 persons, but with shrewdness, good humour, wit, and tolerance brought the meeting to an end with a vote of thanks to himself carried by acclamation. During the following years Hook encountered opposition on many occasions, notably in March 1841, when it became known that he had defended Newman's publication of <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> in letters to Newman and others, and again faced a hostile audience at a meeting of the Pastoral Aid Society in Leeds. But gradually the opposition subsided in the face of his tireless work in Leeds, and his departure in 1859 was marked by a testimonial collection of 2000 guineas.<br>
<br>Hook knew that the material resources at his disposal when he first arrived in Leeds were totally inadequate to the demands made of them. Nevertheless, one of his first decisions was to build a new parish church, which was completed in 1841 at a cost of &pound;28,000, and which had a capacity of nearly 4000 persons, many of them in free seating. He also embarked on a parallel programme of church building throughout the town, and by the time he left Leeds he had doubled the number of Anglican churches to thirty-six. In addition, he increased the number of parsonages from six to twenty-nine, and the number of church schools from three to thirty. In all of this work he found a ready ally in Charles Thomas Longley, the first bishop of the newly reconstructed diocese of Ripon in 1836; the Diocesan Church Building Society gave grants of up to 30 per cent of the cost for building many of the new churches in Leeds. In many ways the centrepiece of this aspect of Hook's work was the <span class="roman">Leeds Vicarage Act</span> of 1844, by which the chapels of ease were reconstituted as parishes in their own right, the former vicar sacrificing not only control but also about one-third of his income.<br>
<br>The liturgical and pastoral life of the town's Anglican churches also underwent a transformation, with Hook increasing the frequency and dignity of the services. His new parish church was specifically designed for a surpliced choir and sacramental worship. When he arrived in Leeds the parish church could barely muster fifty communicants; within four years he had raised that to nearly 500, and could count former Methodist ministers among their number. However, as well as gaining friends by his work Hook could also on occasion arouse equal measures of hostility. His open support for the Ten Hours Movement for factory reform as demonstrated in his speech to a public meeting in Leeds in 1844, when he defended the proposed bill then before parliament on medical, moral, and educational grounds, caused a temporary rift with some of his supporters among the Leeds merchants and manufacturers. In 1846 he published a pamphlet, in the form of a letter to the bishop of St David's, outlining his views on education: he argued that only the state had the capacity to educate all the nation's children, but as there was no longer a common religion in England, secular and religious education should be separated and no one denomination favoured over another. Such ideas led to criticism of him by other high-churchmen, the National Society, and some nonconformists. On the other hand, his frequent lectures at mechanics' institutes and his friendly relations with his churchwardens who were Chartists made him popular with the working population of Leeds. In his early life Hook had been a natural tory, but by the early 1850s he had become sceptical of all organized political parties; the one politician with whom he retained friendly relations throughout his career was William Gladstone, who shared his educational views.<br>
<br>Hook's relationship with his fellow Tractarians also underwent change in the 1850s. His one major disappointment at Leeds was the building of St Saviour's church by E. B. Pusey as a Tractarian centre in the town. His initial support for this was shaken in 1847 when the first clergy from this church converted to Roman Catholicism, followed by further waves of converts into the early 1850s. Indeed, this whole episode was crucial in confirming his own growing disillusionment with the Oxford Movement. By 1859 Hook's energies were clearly waning, and in that year he accepted the offer of the deanery of Chichester, where he could retire to compose his most significant work of scholarship, the <span class="italic">Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury</span>, of which ten volumes were completed before his death. This, his <span class="italic">Church Dictionary</span>, and <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Ecclesiastical Biography</span> (8 vols., 1845&#150;52) were his major academic works. Although well regarded in their time, they were soon overtaken by more advanced historical scholarship. Many of his sermons were collected into two volumes entitled <span class="italic">The Church and her Ordinances</span> (1876). On 5 May 1871 his wife died, and he followed her on 20 October 1875, dying at the deanery in Chichester and being buried next to her at Mid Lavant, Sussex, on 27 October.<br>
