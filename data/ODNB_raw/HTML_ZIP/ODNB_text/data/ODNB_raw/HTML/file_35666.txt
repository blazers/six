<span class="headword">Randall,  Richard William</span>  (1824&#150;1906), <span class="occ">dean of Chichester</span>, born at Bloomsbury Square, London, on 13 April 1824, was the eldest son of James Randall (1790&#150;1882), archdeacon of Berkshire, and his wife, Rebe, only daughter of Richard Lowndes of Rose Hill, Dorking. A younger brother, James Leslie, was appointed suffragan bishop of Reading in 1889. Randall was educated at Winchester College from 1836 to 1842, and then at Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated BA in 1846, with an honorary fourth class in classics, and proceeded MA in 1849 and DD in 1892. In 1847 he was ordained curate to his father, the rector of Binfield, Berkshire. On 6 November 1849 Randall married Wilhelmina, daughter of George Augustus Bruxner, originally a merchant of St Petersburg, who had settled in the Manor House at Binfield. They had six sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1851 Randall was nominated to the rectory of Lavington-cum-Graffham, Sussex, in succession to Archdeacon Manning who had just seceded to Rome. Manning had already become his model and was influential in his adoption of Tractarian practices. At Lavington, Randall's innovations in high-church doctrine and ritual excited some opposition in 1858 and 1859, led by his own curate and taken up by the evangelical press.<br>
<br>In 1868 Randall was presented by the trustees to the new parish church of All Saints, Clifton, designed by G. E. Street and intended as a centre of Tractarian worship and teaching in Bristol. Daily services as well as daily celebrations of the holy communion were instituted, and lectures, <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes, guilds, and confraternities were organized in the parish. Randall showed himself a capable administrator, and raised large sums in support of church work. He gained a wide reputation as a preacher, was chosen by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce as preacher of Lenten sermons at Oxford, and became a well-known director of retreats. His few published works, mainly devotional, originated in this Clifton period. Randall was always a ritualist and a supporter of the English Church Union, and in 1873, owing to complaints as to certain practices at All Saints, Charles John Ellicott, bishop of Gloucester, refused to license curates to the church; however, he declined to allow proceedings to be taken against Randall under the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span>. In 1889 the bishop resumed confirmations in the church, and in 1891 bestowed on Randall an honorary canonry in the cathedral, where he occupied the stall formerly held by his father.<br>
<br>In February 1892 Randall was appointed dean of Chichester by Lord Salisbury. Here he introduced a daily celebration of holy communion, and undertook restoration work at his own expense. Despite suspicion and hostility he effectively began the long high-church tradition at Chichester Cathedral. Owing to ill health he retired in 1902, and settled for a time in London, before moving to Bournemouth. He died at his home, Pelham, Lindsay Road, Bournemouth, on 23 December 1906, and was buried nearby at Branksome.<br>
