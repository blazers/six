<span class="headword">Welsted,  Leonard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1688, <em>d.</em> 1747), <span class="occ">poet</span>, baptized on 3 June 1688 at Abington, Northamptonshire, was the eldest child of Leonard Welsted (1649?&#150;1694), rector of Abington, and Anne Staveley (<i>bap</i>. 1663, <i>d</i>. 1694), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26329/', "Thomas Staveley (bap. 1626, d. 1684)")</script>, the Leicester antiquary. Both parents died in 1694, two years after the father became vicar of St Nicholas, Newcastle upon Tyne: Anne was buried on 18 July, her widower on 15 November; so the orphaned Leonard and his younger brother and sister were brought up by Staveley relatives in Leicestershire. Leonard followed his father to Westminster School (queen's scholar, 1703) and Trinity College, Cambridge (admitted pensioner on 12 June 1707), but, unlike his father, he never graduated. His clandestine &#145;Fleet&#146; marriage on 25 February 1708 to Frances Purcell (<i>bap</i>. 1688), daughter and residuary legatee of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22894/', "Henry Purcell")</script> ended his university career. The only offspring of this union of under-age orphans was a daughter, Frances, baptized on 2 September 1708.<br>
<br>Welsted's first wife died young. On 4 December 1712 he married Anna Maria Walker (<i>d</i>. 1747), sister of Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker; she was called Zelinda in poems by Welsted and his friends, and was said to be a great beauty. There were no children from the second marriage. Welsted's daughter, Frances, died in her eighteenth year and was mourned in his fine <span class="italic">Hymn to the Creator</span> (1727).<br>
<br>Welsted's earliest verse was written at school. His longest known poem, &#145;Her Majesty's Success&#146; (praising the third earl of Peterborough's campaign in Spain), was completed, in 507 lines, before April 1707 and remains unpublished. It was addressed to Robert Harley and was the first of a number of unpublished poems&#151;written between 1707 and 1711, and bidding for tory patronage&#151;which survive among the Harley papers in the Portland collection. Two poems by Welsted in praise of the first duke of Marlborough and his elegy on the poet John Philips were published in 1709. His &#145;Apple-pye, a Poem&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Tory Tatler</span> (1710), which achieved several reprints because it was attributed wrongly to William King, is the only early poem by Welsted that is neither panegyric nor an exercise in patron-hunting. In 1712 he published a translation of Longinus with appended <span class="italic">Remarks on the English Poets</span> addressed to Addison, after which his enrolment among the whigs was confirmed in 1714 when he published <span class="italic">The Prophecy</span>, a satire on Harley, and <span class="italic">An Epistle to Mr Steele on the King's Accession</span>. He became Steele's secretary or assistant and in that capacity carried &pound;500 of government secret service money to Steele, though Pope, in <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>, falsely claimed that Welsted received the money for himself. Welsted contributed to such whig periodicals as Steele's <span class="italic">Town-Talk</span> (1715&#150;16) and Ambrose Philips's <span class="italic">Free-Thinker</span> (1718&#150;19); he wrote a prologue and epilogue for Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span> (1722). Bezaleel Morrice's satirical verse <span class="italic">Epistle to Mr. Welsted</span> (1721) characterizes him, on the strength of his poems in <span class="italic">The Free-Thinker</span>, as a smooth, lightweight, fashionable love poet.<br>
<br>Between 1720 and 1726 Welsted addressed complimentary poems to the duke of Chandos, the duke of Dorset, Earl Cadogan, General Wade, Dr Garth, and the countess of Warwick (on her marriage to Addison). Welsted's comedy, <span class="italic">The Dissembled Wanton</span>, was acted with James Quin in the lead in December 1726, at Lincoln's Inn Fields; it earned the author &pound;138 7<i>s</i>., together with &pound;60 for the printed copy. In 1727 Welsted published proposals for editing and translating the whole works of Horace in five volumes by subscription at a guinea a volume; a few specimens were published, but he soon abandoned the project.<br>
<br>Samuel Garth included Welsted's work in the well-known collective translation of Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> which he edited in 1717. In April of that year Garth asked the duke of Newcastle to find an allowance or a place worth &pound;100 a year in the custom house for Welsted&#151;&#145;a scholar and very modest, your Schoolfellow, and has dedicated things to you&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32658, fol. 12)&#151;but Welsted's place, secured by 1725 and worth &pound;50 p.a., proved to be an extraordinary clerkship in the Ordnance office and was probably owing to the favour of Earl Cadogan, master-general of the ordnance, to whom the poet had also dedicated things.<br>
<br>Welsted described his official residence at the Tower of London in <span class="italic">Oikographia</span> (1725), an engaging poem in octosyllabic couplets where he dwells with relish on his furniture, the family portraits (including his bewhiskered grandsire, the antiquary), the view from an alcove on the roof, and the parlour furnished for a lev&eacute;e of humble bards: altogether a well-appointed dwelling except for the emptiness of its cellar. In 1730 Welsted was advanced to the post of clerk-in-ordinary at the Ordnance office (&pound;70 p.a.), probably through the interest of Bishop Hoadley; in May 1731 he became a commissioner and manager of the national lottery (&pound;150 p.a.), by the favour of Bubb Dodington.<br>
<br>In 1717 Welsted published <span class="italic">Palaemon to Caelia, or, The Triumvirate</span>, a lively verse satire on Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot's <span class="italic">Three Hours after Marriage</span>; in 1724 Welsted's &#145;Dissertation&#146;, prefacing <span class="italic">Epistles, Odes, &amp;c.</span>, contained a slighting reference to a line in Pope's <span class="italic">Essay on Criticism</span>; a year later Welsted was introduced as Pope's main antagonist in Thomas Cooke's <span class="italic">The Battel of the Poets</span>. As a result Welsted's verse and servility to patrons were ridiculed in Pope's <span class="italic">Peri Bathous</span> (1728) and in text and notes of <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> (1728, 1729): most memorably in the Denham parody beginning: &#145;Flow Welsted, flow! like thine inspirer, Beer&#146;  (A. Pope, <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>, 3). Welsted responded with <span class="italic">One Epistle to Mr. A. Pope</span> (1730), <span class="italic">Of Dulness and Scandal</span>, and <span class="italic">Of False Fame</span> (both 1732): the first of these was a collaboration with another <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> victim, James Moore Smythe. Pope had the last word in his <span class="italic">Epistle to Arbuthnot</span> (1735).<br>
<br>Welsted's verse address to the princess of Wales in 1737, at the height of the prince's quarrel with his father, suggests that he was flirting with the whig opposition, but he wrote very little thereafter. He turned to prose in <span class="italic">The Scheme and Conduct of Providence</span> (1736), a conventional vindication of the justice and goodness of God.<br>
<br>Welsted is best known today as a Pope dunce. His complimentary poems are obsequious, his translations, verse tales, and love lyrics are, at best, competent; he was massively outgunned by Pope in satire; but there is merit in his relaxed, conversational, convivial poems, such as &#145;The Invitation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Free-Thinker</span>, 124, 1719), <span class="italic">Oikographia</span>, and his last published work, <span class="italic">The Summum bonum, or, Wisest Philosophy</span> (1741), a poem in praise of simple pleasures, such as the sociable drinking of wine and spirits. Apart from such invitations, and the complaint in <span class="italic">Oikographia</span> that he lacked wine for his spacious cellar in the Tower, there is no evidence for Pope's libel that Welsted was a drunkard or even a beer drinker. John Nichols wrote, &#145;a gentleman now living recollects hearing of Welsted's fame as a chess-player at the Temple Coffee House&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, xxii). Welsted died intestate at the Tower in August 1747; his second wife survived him only for a few months; his brother, Thomas, had died in 1713, so letters of administration were granted on 24 May 1748 to his unmarried sister, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1757).<br>
