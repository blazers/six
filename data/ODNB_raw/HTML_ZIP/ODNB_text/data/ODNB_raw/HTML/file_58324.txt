<span class="headword">Meautys, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1649), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was the third son of Thomas Meautys (<i>d</i>. 1614) of West Ham, Essex, and St Julian's Hospital, Hertfordshire, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1641), daughter of Sir Henry Coningsby of North Mimms, Hertfordshire. The family was descended from John Meautas (or Meautis), a native of Calais and secretary of the French tongue to Henry VII. Thomas Meautys's great-great-grandfather, Philip, was a clerk of the privy council under Henry VII and Henry VIII. His great-grandfather, Sir Peter, gentleman of the privy chamber to Henry VIII, undertook delicate continental missions for the king and acquired the family's Essex estates, former monastic property.<br>
<br>Meautys attended Lincoln's Inn and as a young man was employed by Robert Cecil, first earl of Salisbury. Salisbury's secretary, Sir Thomas Wilson, his uncle by marriage, probably introduced him to Sir Francis Bacon, later lord chancellor and by 1616 he was in Bacon's employment, as were two of his brothers, while a third was employed by Bacon's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Sir John Finch. Meautys and his brothers benefited from their association with Bacon through holding a series of administrative offices in chancery. In 1619 he became an extraordinary clerk of the privy council. He was elected to the parliament of 1621 for the Cambridge borough through the lord chancellor's patronage and would also represent it in every Caroline parliament up to the Short Parliament, though usually as an inactive member.<br>
<br>In 1621, however, Meautys was a vocal and vehement defender of Bacon, accused of using his office to solicit bribes. He said he could see the proceedings were already &#145;chalked out&#146; and demanded hard evidence of his patron's offences. Ultimately he was accused by the house of having served as middleman in the lord chancellor's misconduct, but seems to have escaped punishment when Bacon submitted to the charges. This trial infused him with a bitterness and cynicism toward politics and government, attitudes especially evident in the long series of letters he wrote to his cousin and future mother-in-law, Jane, Lady Bacon.<br>
<br>Whether involved in misconduct or not, Meautys did serve as middleman for Bacon in numerous financial and political transactions. He negotiated Bacon's transfer of a lease on York House to the lord treasurer Sir Lionel Cranfield in hope of obtaining his assistance in Bacon's quest for restoration. It was also through Meautys that Bacon approached the king and the royal favourite, the duke of Buckingham, on matters ranging from approval for the publication of Bacon's life of Henry VII to his return to court. Buckingham defended the offices and reversions held by Meautys in chancery when they were attacked by the new lord keeper, John Williams. When he attempted to redeem a reversion to a mastership of requests, however, Sir John Coke approached Buckingham for that office. He suggested Meautys be given one of the two council clerkships about to become vacant and Buckingham agreed, though he upheld incumbent clerk Sir Francis Cottington's wish to be paid &pound;450 for the office. Meautys was later allowed to recoup the money from the making of a baronet, for which he preferred his cousin, Sir Frederick Cornwallis.<br>
<br>In 1626 Buckingham aided Meautys in his attempt to add the clerkship of writs and processes in Star Chamber to his collection of offices. Meautys borrowed &pound;600 of the &pound;900 it cost him from Jane, Lady Bacon. Sir Francis Bacon died in April 1626 and the probate of his will a year later made Meautys, along with the other chief creditor, Sir Robert Rich, co-administrator of his patron's debt-ridden estate. He funded a marble monument with an epitaph composed by his cousin Sir Henry Wotton to be erected over the grave of his beloved master in St Michael's, Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, and seems to have done quite well for himself out of Bacon's estate. Gorhambury was conveyed to trustees for the use of Meautys, who leased it to his cousin-by-marriage, the earl of Sussex, and then to the earl's widow and her new husband.<br>
<br>In June 1626 Meautys was admitted to Gray's Inn and took up residence in Bacon's old chambers there. The following September he purchased the crown manor of Redbourne, Hertfordshire, once held by Bacon. His combined income from land and the offices he held has been estimated at between &pound;1000 and &pound;1200 per annum, a comfortable sum despite his complaints that the demands of continual service deprived him of any free time. Some of his colleagues in the council office believed him expert at &#145;slipping his neck out of the collar&#146; of his service in the post, undertaken in rotation. After Bacon's death he apparently conducted occasional business for members of the nobility such as Bacon's old friend Edward Sackville, earl of Dorset, and Thomas Wentworth, earl of Cleveland, of whose family Meautys counted himself a member.<br>
<br>Twice during the 1630s Meautys applied for a licence to remove butcher's offal from London, but was denied both times. On the basis of his council clerkship, he was appointed muster-master general in March 1636. In 1638 Meautys and his heirs were granted a weekly market and three annual fairs at Redbourne, and that same year he became treasurer for life to the Company of Starchmakers. The next spring he was one of two council clerks designated to attend the king on his journey to York, but he fell ill and returned to London to recover. He was elected to the Short Parliament for Cambridge on the lord keeper's nomination, alongside Oliver Cromwell, but despite his provision of money and venison for feasting the corporation at the spring election, he lost the seat in the Long Parliament to town councillor John Lowry.<br>
<br>In February 1641, the same month he was knighted by the king at Whitehall, Meautys arranged for his Coningsby nieces to inherit Redbourne, but changed his mind on his marriage three months later, settling the manor on his young bride, Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1615, <i>d</i>. 1680), daughter of Jane, Lady Bacon. He was reportedly very ill again in 1642: &#145;pore man he lokes miserably&#146;, one of his cousins wrote  (Verney, 1.254). He effectively retired and was living at Gorhambury when he was lightly taxed by the parliamentarian commissioners in 1645. He died at Gorhambury and was buried at Bacon's feet in St Michael's Church on 31 October 1649. His infant daughter Jane was his sole heir but his estate passed to his brother Henry at the child's premature death in 1652. His widow married Sir Harbottle Grimston, an old business acquaintance and later speaker of the Convention Commons, who purchased Redbourne and Gorhambury.<br>
