<span class="headword">Poulett,  John</span>, first Baron Poulett  (1586&#150;1649), <span class="occ">local politician and royalist army officer</span>, was the eldest son and heir of Sir Anthony Poulett 
    (or Paulet; 1561/2&#150;1600)
   of Hinton St George, Somerset, governor of Jersey from 1588 until his death, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1602), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20272/', "Henry Norris, first Baron Norris of Rycote")</script>. Poulett's paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21612/', "Sir Amias Paulet")</script>, the gaoler of Mary, queen of Scots, and Elizabethan privy councillor. While in wardship following his father's death on 22 July 1600 John matriculated at University College, Oxford, in 1601, aged fifteen, and travelled abroad in 1603. Already established in Somerset county society with a colonelcy of militia cavalry in 1608, he was admitted specially at the Middle Temple in January 1611. By 1613 he was a justice of the peace, and in 1616 sheriff of Somerset. He was a deputy lieutenant at least from 1624. His social position was reinforced by his financially advantageous marriage, about 1614, to Elizabeth (1593?&#150;1663?), daughter of Christopher Ken or Kenn, of Kenn Court, Somerset, with whom he had five daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>Poulett sat for Somerset in the last six weeks of the 1610 session of parliament and appears not to have spoken in debate. He was returned, again for the county, to the parliament of 1614. It was a brutal election, in which he was returned instead of Sir Robert Phelips, whom he had promised not to oppose. Phelips was forced to sit for Saltash. The election ruptured the slight friendship that had existed between Poulett and Phelips, and began a rivalry which dominated Somerset for two decades. Poulett's parliamentary service in 1614 was no more than being named to the committee for the oath <i>ex officio</i> and speaking once on the last day, while Phelips's parliamentary career began in earnest. In 1621 Phelips sat for Bath and Poulett sat for Lyme Regis. While Phelips achieved prominence in 1621 Poulett figured not at all in debate. He did not again attend a parliament until he took his seat in the Lords in 1628, and was there no more voluble than he had been in the lower house.<br>
<br>Both Poulett and Phelips aspired to political power in Somerset, the former by assiduous and often obsequious cultivation of contacts at court, the latter by bold and exaggerated defence of the &#145;country's&#146; interests. Phelips's appeal was broader and more populist; Poulett's more narrowly focused on the county's numerous and prosperous gentry. There was little ideological distinction between them. Poulett was not involved in the sedition of Edmond Peacham, vicar of Hinton St George, among whose papers was found a sermon he had written foretelling the king's death as a divine judgment. Peacham had been presented to the living by Poulett's grandfather Sir Amias a quarter-century earlier, and Poulett's examinations by the privy council in 1614&#150;15 were merely an exercise of its routine prudence. Poulett was no more a &#145;popular man&#146; in 1640 than the rest of the aristocracy who realized the regime could not stop the Scots without a parliament. In their rivalry for local power Poulett and Phelips divided the county's magnates along lines of kinship and affinity and of office. Poulett, as the principal deputy lieutenant to a non-resident lord lieutenant, controlled the lieutenancy; Phelips regularly carried a majority of the magistrates with him. But they made no appeals to higher loyalty or to sectarian principles. By the same token both were substantially indifferent to the larger issues which were in train towards revolution.<br>
<br>Poulett's advancement was sudden and considerable. Charles I visited him at Hinton in 1625, and at the king's request Poulett entertained the exiled Huguenot military commander Benjamin de Rohan, seigneur de Soubise, at Hinton from October 1625 to September 1626. Soubise, agitating for a major expedition to relieve La Rochelle, was an embarrassment to the king, and his rustication removed him from court. One of Poulett's opponents remarked that the king had &#145;committed Monsieur de Soubize to Mr Poulettes custodie, because hee knewe him to bee a good gaoler&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/40/58). So he was, for Poulett kept Whitehall informed of his guest's restlessness, and when Soubise finally bolted, Poulett despaired. However, largely for his painful service, Poulett was created first Baron Poulett on 23 June 1627.<br>
<br>Peerage gave Poulett extraordinary standing in a county with only one other resident peer, one who took no active part in county politics or administration. But it did not save his hunting when the disafforestation of Neroche Forest ended his office as warden there, and his uncharacteristic complicity in popular opposition to the project very nearly brought his disgrace at court in 1631. His command, from May to September 1635, of the king's ship <i>Constant Reformation</i> in the earl of Lindsay's ship money fleet in the channel was gratifying. But the round of personally expensive on-board entertainment and short sallies to force Dutch merchantmen to strike their colours ended with his illness, the accolade of knighthood for himself and his eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_22633">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, in 1635 being slight consolation. Poulett's choleric temperament repeatedly caused him to overreact to Phelips's challenges. Even with the court's favour, in virtually every confrontation with Phelips&#151;over the payment of the muster-master, pressing of Phelips's adherents as soldiers, sacking a friend of Poulett as a militia officer, deputy lieutenants' warrants, churchales, disafforestation&#151;Poulett lost, both in the county and at the council table.<br>
<br>In the first civil war Poulett achieved something of an apotheosis. With the militia ordinance of 1642 he withdrew from the Lords, signed the York manifesto in June, and joined the marquess of Hertford at Wells in executing the commission of array. As the roundheads slowly reduced Somerset, Poulett fortified Hinton St George in September and put up a stiff fight before retreating with two cannon to Sherborne. In March 1643 parliament impeached him for treason while he was in Wales and the marches with Hertford. The earl of Essex captured Poulett in October in Shropshire. After escaping he served under Sir Ralph Hopton, recruiting a sizeable force around Oxford which invaded Dorset, besieging Lyme Regis with Prince Maurice. After Essex raised the siege in June 1644 Poulett retreated to Exeter and was commissioner there until the city's fall in April 1646, when he was taken prisoner. Thanks to the good offices of Sir Thomas Fairfax, Poulett was treated leniently by parliament, being ordered to pay a &pound;2742 fine, &pound;1500 compensation for destroying Lady Drake's house in Dorset, and an annuity of &pound;200 to Lyme Regis. He was allowed to retire to Hinton, where he died on 20 March 1649. He was buried in Hinton, and his memorial is the chapel dedicated to his memory in the parish church.<br>
<br>All three of Poulett's sons&#151;John, Francis, and Amias&#151;were solid royalists. His youngest daughter, Elizabeth, married the eldest son of John Ashburnham, who having married Poulett's relict in 1649 was both father-in-law and stepfather of Elizabeth.<br>

<a name="cosubject_22633"></a><span class="headword">John Poulett</span>, second Baron Poulett  (<em>c.</em>1615&#150;1665), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, matriculated at Oxford from Exeter College in 1632, without apparently graduating; in March 1643 he was awarded an honorary MD degree at Oxford. He was knighted with his father in 1635 and took no active part in Somerset affairs until he was returned for the county in the Long Parliament. But he had travelled on the continent, and in February 1640 was with Lord Conway's army in the north. He figured only slightly in the Commons, and withdrew with his father to do battle in Somerset in the summer of 1642, being impeached in September. Appointed to the council of Munster, he commanded a regiment against the Catholic confederate insurgents which was sent to Bristol after the 1643 armistice. He and his younger brother Amias served valiantly in the battles of 1644 in Somerset. John was in the Winchester Castle garrison that surrendered to Cromwell in October 1645. He joined his father at Exeter, and with its fall in April 1646 was barely allowed composition under the articles of capitulation. But it was his marriage to Sir Thomas Fairfax's sister-in-law, Catherine (1612/13&#150;1648&times;53), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28211/', "Sir Horace Vere")</script> and widow of Oliver St John, which had taken place in March 1641 (by marriage licence dated 6 March 1641) that moved Fairfax's several interventions to save the Poulett fortunes. John and Catherine had two sons and three daughters. She was alive in March 1648 but had died by 30 January 1653 when he married Anne (<i>b</i>. 1635, <i>d</i>. in or before 1711), the second daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Browne.<br>
<br>Having succeeded to the barony in 1649 Poulett remained a stalwart, though circumspect royalist: he was imprisoned in 1655 in Major-General Disbrowe's sweep of Somerset royalists, and again in 1658 though under more lenient conditions. A deputy lieutenant after the Restoration, he died on 15 September 1665 at his house at Court de Wick in the parish of Yatton, Somerset, and was buried on 24 October at Hinton St George. John Poulett, his eldest son with Catherine, succeeded as third baron, and was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22634/', "John Poulett, first Earl Poulett")</script>.<br>
<br>The Pouletts were very wealthy. In 1638 the estate was worth &pound;2100 per annum clear. The second baron's properties in Somerset, Dorset, Berkshire, and Essex were settled on him during his father's life, and were valued at &pound;1500 per annum. Besides the great house at Hinton St George and the commodious house of Court de Wick (or Courtaweek), the house and lands in Chiswick, Middlesex, served for the London season. The first baron made generous provision for his daughters and two younger sons. He made his son and heir both executor and residual legatee of all other chattels, real and personal, demonstrating a deep affection and trust forged in the comradeship of arms.<br>
