<span class="headword">Sangster,  Vernon Edmund</span>  (1899&#150;1986), <span class="occ">football pools promoter</span>, was born at 69 Orient Street, Cheetham, Manchester, on 25 June 1899, the son of Alfred Edmund Sangster and his wife, Robina Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burgess. His father was a wholesale draper operating from a number of warehouses in Manchester. Sangster manifested little interest in pursuing the family business. Following the First World War, during which Sangster spent a brief period of service as a teenage soldier of the Manchester regiment in the 55th West Lancashire division, he and his father noticed the growing interest in football betting in the north-west of England. They drew up a plan based on the principle that large prizes for a little outlay would appeal to the gambling instinct, and that enough stakes pooled could generate large prizes. They launched their scheme, based on coupons, in 1923 in Manchester.<br>
<br>The scheme was successful, and in 1925 the Sangsters moved their operation to Liverpool, where Littlewoods and other pools companies were based, giving as their reason the spur of competition. The business prospered during the 1920s, and boomed during the 1930s, causing Vernons, as the company was known, to invest in new plants throughout the Liverpool area. A wealthy man, Vernon Sangster purchased West Lodge on Meols Drive, Hoylake, in the Wirral. Within commuting distance of his various workplaces in the north-west, it was to be his lifelong home, shared with his wife, Margaret Martha (Peggy), with whom he had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93631/', "Robert Edmund Sangster")</script>, born in May 1936. The house was also conveniently next door to a golf course: golf was Sangster's favourite hobby.<br>
<br>Sangster was a paternalistic employer, pioneering a house magazine from 1935, with a variety of features and a regular contribution from himself. He was known as the &#145;Guv'nor&#146; to his 6000 employees. The works-based singing group, the Vernons Girls, sang their way to national fame during the war. Sangster thus developed both formal and informal techniques of securing good working relations in his pools-checking plants, as well as publicity for his company. Most of his workforce were women, largely employed on a part-time and seasonal basis.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Sangster engaged in public philanthropy, donating large sums to local charities at a time when there was considerable national concern over the health and morale of the unemployed in poorly-off areas. In particular, he donated thousands of pounds to Liverpool city council to found the Vernon Sangster Sports Centre at Stanley Park. Set alongside his paternalism and philanthropy, however, was his oft-repeated maxim to his son that there was no room for sentiment in business.<br>
<br>Vernons, in common with other pools companies, faced difficulties despite its prosperity. During the 1930s a strong anti-gambling lobby wanted to stamp out pools betting. The Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake raised the spectre of a national lottery. A few tricksters attempted fiddles by infiltrating coupons into the system after the football results were published. As a consequence, Sangster was a leading founding member of the Pools Promoters' Association (PPA), formed in 1934 to articulate and lobby for the interests of his company. Through the PPA, Sangster also opposed the imposition of a pool betting duty by the Labour government in the later 1940s.<br>
<br>Sangster ran the business until his retirement in the early 1970s. By then, Vernons's market share had decreased in competition with Littlewoods. Sangster appears to have been upset about, and to have resisted, the attempts by his son, Robert, to sell the company. In retirement Sangster lived with his wife and a number of house servants. He died at his home on 17 December 1986 from cardiac failure and arteriosclerosis. His funeral took place at St Hildeburgh's Church, Hoylake. Survived by his wife, he left an estate worth almost &pound;3 million.<br>
