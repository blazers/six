<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Connor <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Conner; <em>later </em>Condorcet-O'Connor]</span>,  Arthur</span>  (1763&#150;1852), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and political theorist</span>, was born on 4 July 1763 at Connorville, near Bandon in co. Cork, the second youngest of nine children, four daughters and five sons, of Roger Conner (<i>d</i>. 1798), MP, and Anne Longfield (<i>d</i>. 1782), daughter of Robert Longfield MP and sister of Richard Longfield, made Viscount Longueville in 1800. Arthur and his brother Roger Conner [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20523/', "O'Connor, Roger")</script>] changed their surname to O'Connor in the 1780s. Arthur's upbringing and education were typical of the prosperous Munster Anglican gentry and he was steeped in their attitudes, including their notorious anti-Catholicism. His early schooling was at Bandon and at Mr Browne's school, Castlelyons, and he entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner in 1779. He delayed his legal education at the inns of court owing to his grief at his mother's death but was called to the Irish bar in 1788, though he never practised. His father broke up the family estate after his wife's death and Arthur's portion allowed him to buy his own property and build a house, Fort Arthur, in the vicinity of Kinsale. Through his uncle's political influence he was MP for Philipstown from 1790 and was appointed high sheriff of Cork for 1791.<br>
<br>O'Connor's intellectual and cultural interests differentiated him from his class. He was an early and passionate enthusiast for Adam Smith's political economy. He renounced anti-Catholicism through his discovery, or perhaps invention, of his own descent from the O'Connors of co. Kerry, a Gaelic noble family. This motivated his connection with Charles O'Conor of Belangare and an interest in Irish antiquity. A visit to France in 1784 had convinced him that there the monarchy could not survive and he confirmed his enthusiasm for the French Revolution, despite an acquaintance with Edmund Burke, in a return journey in 1792, when he first met Lafayette. Yet these views did not prevent his uncle, Richard Longfield, from proposing to William Pitt in 1792 that O'Connor be given office in the Irish administration as part of the package of measures to encourage independent support for the ministry in the Irish House of Commons.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war with France in 1793, for which, in common with much of the opposition, O'Connor blamed Pitt, strained his commitment to establishment politics. He finally broke with them after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of the Fitzwilliam viceroyalty. The debate on the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Bill</span> in 1795 gave him a platform from which to announce his support of emancipation, manhood suffrage, and the full agenda of political reform, and from which to hint at separatism and the possibility of revolution:<blockquote>France must have lost her senses if she hesitates as to what part she must take: it is not an eighty-fourth department you will have moulded to her wishes; it is not simply <i>La Vend&eacute;e</i> you will have kindled in the bosom of your country. (&#145;Arthur O'Connor's speech on the Catholic question, in the House of Commons, on the 4th of May 1795&#146;, <span class="italic">The Beauties of the Press</span>, 1800, 597)</blockquote>This speech catapulted him to prominence in radical politics in England as much as in Ireland. He made lasting political friendships with Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Sir Francis Burdett as well as gaining entry to the Devonshire circle. His connections among the Foxites, including Charles James Fox himself, Lord Moira, and Sheridan, were his character witnesses when he was tried for treason at Maidstone in May 1798.<br>
<br>O'Connor's politics would have made him a radical in England, but the political conditions in Ireland made a principled but pacific opposition to the government almost impossible. As political options polarized, few members of the establishment chose republicanism over protestant ascendancy; O'Connor and his friend Lord Edward Fitzgerald were the two most prominent members of the religious and political establishment to do so. In 1796 O'Connor joined the United Irishmen and travelled in company with Fitzgerald in May and June through Hamburg and Basel to Angers to negotiate a French invasion in support of an Irish rising. Building on Wolfe Tone's impressive diplomatic work, O'Connor and General Hoche agreed to French military support for an independent Irish republic. The result was the abortive landing at Bantry Bay in December 1796.<br>
<br>O'Connor played little part in the planning for the 1798 rebellion. Though he represented Ulster on the United Irish Directory he could play little part in its deliberations. He was gaoled from February to August 1797 and then arrested at Margate, Kent while trying to travel to France in February 1798 and so was either incarcerated or abroad for most of this period. His major contribution was as the most sophisticated political thinker in the movement. He developed his ideas in the pages of his Dublin newspaper <span class="italic">The Press</span> and in his most important pamphlet, <span class="italic">The State of Ireland</span> (1798). His project was to reinterpret Irish social and political development in the context of general European trends. Working from the Scottish social theorists, especially Smith, he argued for an ideal of the nation as a productive community organized through an equality of political and civil rights. His work blended French universalist ideas of politics with British patterns of commercial development to create a commercial republicanism. O'Connor thought that the defects of the British constitutional order were most spectacularly evident in Ireland, but not confined to it. His eventual goal was to transform the British Isles into a comity of sister republics. The alternative, he argued, was state oppression punctuated by outbreaks of sectarian <i>jacquerie</i>. O'Connor was by no means the only United Irishman who thought in terms of universal political principles and in an international context, but his work made the most original use of those principles in the complexity of the Irish situation.<br>
<br>After the failure of the 1798 rebellion O'Connor was confined in Fort St George, along with twenty other prisoners, where previous disagreements between O'Connor and Thomas Addis Emmett over political tactics degenerated into personal antipathy. O'Connor had a domineering personality and an ironic disposition; Benjamin Constant wrote of him that &#145;he has something of the French defect of joking about his own opinion&#146;  (B. Constant, <span class="italic">Journaux intimes</span>, ed. A. Roulin and C. Roth, 1952, 189), and this made him a difficult partner in adversity. His personal fortunes did improve after his release to France on the peace of Amiens in 1802. Napoleon gave him the rank of <i>g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de division</i> in 1804, though without any command. He became part of the <i>id&eacute;ologue</i> circle and in 1807 married the writer Eliza Condorcet (1791&#150;1867), the daughter of Sophie de Grouchy and Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, marquis de Condorcet. His last publication was to be the definitive edition of Condorcet's works and he took the name Condorcet-O'Connor as the family title. In 1808 he and his wife bought the former ch&acirc;teau of Mirabeau p&egrave;re at Le Bignon in the department of the Loiret. He took French nationality in 1818.<br>
<br>Condorcet-O'Connor's later life was difficult. His three sons predeceased him and his relationship with his brother Roger collapsed over disputes about Roger's use of the power of attorney he had been given over Arthur's Irish property. This put a barrier between Arthur and Roger's son, Feargus O'Connor, leader of the Chartists. Furthermore, his reputation in Ireland suffered an eclipse. To the Irish public, Lord Longueville's judgement that &#145;of all bad men he is the worst&#146; was too epigrammatic to resist. Though he initially made friendly contact with Daniel O'Connell during his visit to Ireland in 1834, he later condemned him as a tool of the Jesuits. Much of his later work, including his <span class="italic">Monopoly, the Cause of All Evil</span> (1849), relapsed into rampant anti-Catholicism and he has not been included in the pantheon of national heroes. He died at Le Bignon on 25 April 1852, and was buried there in the park.<br>
