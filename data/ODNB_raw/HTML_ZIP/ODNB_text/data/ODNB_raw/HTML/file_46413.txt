<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moncrieff,  Charles Kenneth Michael  Scott</span>  (1889&#150;1930), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born on 25 September 1889 at Weedingshall, Polmont, near Falkirk, Stirlingshire, the third son of William George Scott Moncrieff (1846&#150;1927), advocate and sheriff substitute for Stirlingshire, and his wife, Jessie Margaret (1858&#150;1936), daughter of Robert Scott Moncrieff, merchant of Calcutta. The Moncrieffs (variously spelt) are an ancient Scottish family; Scott Moncrieff, a keen genealogist, traced their history in the introduction to his translation (1925) of <span class="italic">The Adventures of Zelo&iuml;de and Amanzarifdine</span> by an eighteenth-century French cousin, Paradis de Moncrif. He never used the form Scott-Moncrieff, by which he is often known.<br>
<br>Scott Moncrieff's boyhood was spent in Scotland in a number of different places. His father was transferred successively to Inverness and Lanark, and he himself, who was proud of his Scottishness, wrote ruefully in 1929 that he had no place of his own: &#145;it is a grim thing to be homeless&#146;  (Scott Moncrieff, 189).<br>
<br>Being considerably younger than his brothers, Scott Moncrieff had a somewhat solitary childhood, developing a taste for books and starting early to write poetry. He went to school in Inverness and Nairn, and in 1903 won a scholarship to Winchester College, from where in 1908 he went to Edinburgh University; he took a first degree in law, was awarded a bursary in Old English in 1913, and graduated with first-class honours in English language and literature in 1914. Among his teachers was Professor George Saintsbury, who was to become a valued friend.<br>
<br>A keen officer cadet, Scott Moncrieff was commissioned second lieutenant in 1913; in August 1914 he joined the King's Own Scottish Borderers. He served in Flanders for more than two years, though with long periods of sick leave, and won the admiration and affection of his fellow soldiers through his concern for them and his bravery. In 1915 he was promoted captain. In April 1917 he was severely wounded in the leg while leading his battalion into an attack; the wound left him permanently lame. In May 1917 he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. After convalescing he served in the War Office until the end of the war.<br>
<br>The experience of war left its mark on Scott Moncrieff, not only physically, but through the loss of many friends. His translation (1919) of the Old French <span class="italic">Chanson de Roland</span> contains dedicatory poems to three of these, including Wilfred Owen, to whom he became deeply attached in 1918. The <span class="italic">Song of Roland</span> was followed by a translation of another epic, <span class="italic">Beowulf</span>, in 1921. In the immediate post-war period he moved in London literary circles, reviewing regularly in G. K. Chesterton's <span class="italic">New Witness</span>, and publishing occasional stories and poems. He worked for a time as private secretary for Lord Northcliffe and as a journalist on <span class="italic">The Times</span>, but from 1923 lived entirely on his earnings as a translator.<br>
<br>In 1919 Scott Moncrieff had discovered Marcel Proust's <span class="italic">A la recherche du temps perdu</span> (rendered in his translation as <span class="italic">Remembrance of Things Past</span>). Over the next ten years he published <span class="italic">Swann's Way</span> (2 vols., 1922), <span class="italic">Within a Budding Grove</span> (2 vols., 1924), <span class="italic">The Guermantes Way</span> (2 vols., 1925), <span class="italic">Cities of the Plain</span> (2 vols., 1927&#150;9), <span class="italic">The Captive</span> (1929), and <span class="italic">The Sweet Cheat Gone</span> (1930). (The final volume of Proust's sequence, <span class="italic">Time Regained</span>, was done by his friend Sydney Schiff after his death.) Although Scott Moncrieff joked irreverently about Proust, he set great value on him and after Proust's death edited <span class="italic">Marcel Proust: an English Tribute</span> (1923).<br>
<br>Scott Moncrieff translated much else besides: four major works of fiction by Stendhal (<span class="italic">The Charterhouse of Parma</span>, 2 vols., 1925; <span class="italic">Scarlet and Black</span>, 2 vols., 1926; <span class="italic">The Abbess of Castro and other Tales</span>, 1926; <span class="italic">Armance</span>, 1928); three volumes of Pirandello; the Latin letters of Abelard and H&eacute;loise; the memoirs of Lauzun; a frivolous tale by Paradis de Moncrif; a novel by Jean-Richard Bloch. He translated quickly, for modest financial rewards, and some of his authors (for example, Bloch and Abelard) he found less congenial than Proust. The bookseller Orioli described his way of working in these terms:<blockquote>He carried in his left hand the French volume he was translating, read a few lines of it, interrupted his reading in order to talk to me, and then took a notebook out of his pocket and wrote in English the few lines he had just read, leaning against a pine tree. (Orioli, 228)</blockquote>From 1923 until his death Scott Moncrieff lived principally in Italy, first in Tuscany, mainly in Pisa, and from 1928 in Rome. His friend the German scholar E. R. Curtius wrote that &#145;he was a Roman body and soul&#146;, loving &#145;the everyday life of the city&#146;. He returned to Britain from time to time, and cultivated a wide circle of friends. He loved conversation; according to Curtius, &#145;a dominating, brilliantly humorous mood was his usual attitude&#146;  (Scott Moncrieff, 179). His reviewing was combative and caustic, notably in a prolonged polemic with the Sitwell circle begun in <span class="italic">New Witness</span> in 1919 and culminating in the pamphlet <span class="italic">The Strange and Striking Adventures of Four Authors in Search of a Character</span>, published under the name of P. G. Lear and L. O. in 1926. Some found him malicious, but the <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist insisted on the goodness and kindness beneath the surface. He remained close to his mother and supported the families of his brothers, giving as his recreation in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> &#145;nepotism&#146;.<br>
<br>Scott Moncrieff was a handsome, well-built man, with a fine head and a remarkable voice. Having converted to Roman Catholicism during the war, he practised assiduously and fervently. At the same time he had a marked taste for the scandalous, writing an enthusiastic preface for a reissue (1923) of the <span class="italic">Satyricon</span> of Petronius, with whom he compares Proust for his frank description of unorthodox morals (Scott Moncrieff shared Proust's homosexual orientation).<br>
<br>Vyvyan Holland, in his obituary, wrote that Scott Moncrieff did much to raise the profession of translator to an honourable position in the world of literature. He is, with Constance Garnett, the most celebrated of twentieth-century translators into English. He attempted in <span class="italic">Beowulf</span> and in the assonant verse of the <span class="italic">Song of Roland</span> to respect both form and meaning, bringing readers into contact with something foreign and archaic. These versions were much praised in his day, but it was in the translation of modern writing that he made his lasting contribution to English literature. His Stendhal, vigorous and witty though it is, was partly superseded by other versions, but his Proust, later revised to take account of new French editions, was the classic text which exerted an incalculable influence on readers and on literature in English in the twentieth century. There are errors and omissions in the translation, but it is generally scrupulous, rendering Proust's rhythms and images with remarkable flair. His English has acquired a not inappropriate period flavour; although some feel that his version prettifies Proust, he creates in language an attractive and witty narrator worthy of the original.<br>
<br>In November 1929 Scott Moncrieff was admitted to hospital in Rome, suffering from terminal cancer. He suffered great pain and died there on 28 February 1930. His funeral service was held in the baptistery of the church of St John Lateran, and he was buried in the Verano cemetery on 2 March. His estate after death (almost entirely books and currency) was estimated at &pound;418.<br>
