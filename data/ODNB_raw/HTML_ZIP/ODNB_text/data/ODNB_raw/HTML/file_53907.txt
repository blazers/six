<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armitt,  Mary Louisa</span>  (1851&#150;1911), <span class="occ">author and founder of the Armitt Library, Ambleside</span>, was born at 19 Melbourne Terrace, Salford, Lancashire, on 24 September 1851. She was the youngest of three daughters of William Armitt (1815&#150;1867), an impecunious assistant overseer who valued learning, and his wife, Mary Ann Whalley (1813&#150;1879), from Rivington, Lancashire. Although suffering poor health, the daughters&#151;Sophia (1847&#150;1908), Annie Maria (1850&#150;1933), who later became Mrs Stanford Harris, and Mary Louisa&#151;achieved much, all three becoming versatile writers. Initially they attended the local Islington House Academy, Sophia eventually wishing to specialize in art and botany, Annie in literature, and Mary in music. While Sophia later attended the Manchester School of Art, Mary, who left school at fourteen, began studying music, her great love, at Manchester Mechanics' Institute School. In 1866 the two eldest sisters spent three months in Paris, and it became customary for all the sisters to spend vacations abroad, pursuing their various studies.<br>
<br>Their father died when Mary Armitt was only fifteen, and the sisters had to support themselves. They moved to Eccles, Lancashire, where they set up a successful school, Mary being a year younger than their eldest pupil. They worked very hard, but enjoyed Manchester's cultural facilities, attending the original Hall&eacute; concerts, lectures, exhibitions, and field naturalist meetings. Largely self-educated, their creative lives were spent writing, teaching, painting (Ruskin later gave encouragement to Sophia), and studying. Aged eighteen, Mary sought advice from Ruskin, and she was urged by him &#145;not to wish to write&#146; but to &#145;exercise yourself in all proper girls' and women's work&#146;  (John Ruskin to Mary Armitt, Feb 1870, Armitt Library, MS 377). One day, however, greatly moved by a piano recital by Anton Rubinstein, she was inspired to write a long musical appreciation for the <span class="italic">Manchester City News</span>. It was immediately published (21 April 1877), and became the first of many.<br>
<br>In 1886 Mary and Sophia Armitt retired to Hawkshead in the Lake District, and from 1896 they lived at Rydal, near their invalid sister. There they found themselves in an intellectual ambience suited to their temperaments and talents. Through close friendships with neighbours such as Frances Arnold of Fox How and Charlotte Mason, the educational pioneer of what became Charlotte Mason College, Ambleside, they met many distinguished writers, artists, and educationists.<br>
<br>Mary Armitt suffered heart trouble, and was no longer able to travel abroad, or to visit libraries such as the Bodleian, where she had loved to pore over old books and manuscripts to produce erudite articles (for example, &#145;Old English viol music&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Musical Quarterly Review</span> of 1888). She now joined the London Library, and began to study local history. Using the Le Fleming family archives at Rydal Hall, she prepared two books&#151;<span class="italic">Rydal</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">The Church of Grasmere</span> (1912), both published posthumously&#151;and papers for the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society. She wrote prolifically for national magazines, newspapers, and educational publications such as the <span class="italic">Parents' Review</span>, edited by Charlotte Mason. She was also interested in natural history, especially ornithology, and at W. G. Collingwood's request contributed a full report of the birds of the Lake District in the opening chapter of part 3 of his <span class="italic">Lake Counties</span> (1902).<br>
<br>Shortly before Mary Armitt's death, a legacy enabled her to found and endow in 1909 the Armitt Library, in Ambleside, a reference library and museum for subscribing &#145;students and book-lovers&#146;. It was opened in November 1912, and became an important depository of rare books, prints, manuscripts, pictures, and artefacts, mainly about the Lake District but also including items of international interest. It embodied two earlier libraries: the 1828 Ambleside Book Club, of which Wordsworth had been a member, and the 1882 Ambleside Ruskin Library, founded with Ruskin's help and approval.<br>
<br>Subscribers included members of prominent local literary and artistic families, not least Beatrix Potter, who was a member for nearly thirty years and who gave many family books, as well as hundreds of her fungus and natural history watercolour drawings and microscope studies. Important original archives include letters, drawings, manuscripts, and memorabilia of Ruskin, Harriet Martineau, the Lake Poets, the Arnolds, William Green, W. G. Collingwood, and Robin G. Collingwood, among many others.<br>
<br>Mary Armitt died at her home, Rydal Cottage, on 31 July 1911, and was buried on 2 August beside her sister Sophia in St Mary's churchyard, Ambleside. Annie was later buried with them.<br>
