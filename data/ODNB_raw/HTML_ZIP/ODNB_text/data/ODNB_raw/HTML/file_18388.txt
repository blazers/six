<span class="headword">Maurice,  William</span>  (1619/20&#150;1680), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the son of Lewis Maurice of Cefn-y-braich, Llansilin, Denbighshire, a man of literary interests, descended from the house of Moelyrch, and Jane, daughter of John Holland, vicar of Cegidfa. His education is unrecorded. He married first Lettice, daughter of Roger Kynaston of Cefn-y-carneddau, Ruabon; they had three sons who died young and two daughters: Ann, who married David Williams of Glan Alaw, brother of Sir William Williams (1634&#150;1700), speaker of the House of Commons, and Lettice. From his second marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of George Ludlow of Morehouse and widow of Thomas Gethin, he had a daughter, Elizabeth. He resided at Cefn-y-braich and T&#375; Newydd, Llansilin.<br>
<br>By 1638 Maurice was making copies of Welsh poetry. He became the best-read Welsh antiquary of his generation, with interest in literature, history, and law. Helped by amanuenses, he was an assiduous transcriber. His collection of manuscripts, known from copies of his own catalogue, amounted to over a hundred. His transcripts are notable for his care in recording exemplars and sources. A young associate of Robert Vaughan, he catalogued the Hengwrt manuscripts in 1658; his coarse hand appears in scores of manuscripts which survive in the Hengwrt and other collections. He is said to have built himself a three-storey library.<br>
<br>Maurice's scholarly virtues can best be appreciated in his <span class="italic">Deddfgrawn</span> or <span class="italic">Corpus Hoelianum</span>  (Wynnstay MSS 37&#150;38), his compilation of Welsh law: his analysis laid the basis of the modern classification of the texts. His detailed, matter-of-fact chronicle of events in north Wales from 1638 to 1647, which betrays no obvious sympathy with either side, was printed from his manuscript in 1846 before its destruction. However, in religion Maurice was radical and in 1653 he wrote a forceful tract against &#145;altar-worship&#146;. His style, when polemical, as in this and his antiquarian tracts (none was printed), whether writing in Latin, English, or Welsh, is florid and bombastic. The scholarly Humphrey Humphreys, referring to a tract on British coins, described Maurice as &#145;a very injudicious man&#146;  (NL Wales, MS 2029, no. 2, p. 34); other contemporaries regarded him as eccentric.<br>
<br>Maurice made his will on 11 March 1680, &#145;somewhat crasie and infirme in body&#146;, leaving his books, both printed and manuscript, to his daughter Lettice. He died on 27 March 1680 and was buried at Llansilin on 31 March. His manuscript collection was bought after his death by Sir William Williams and descended to the Williams-Wynns of Wynnstay. The greater part was lost in the fire which destroyed the Wynnstay library in 1858. Fewer than ten of Maurice's manuscripts survived the fire; a few more, and a number of his annotated printed books, survive in other collections.<br>
