<span class="headword">&Oacute; Domhnaill,  Gofraidh</span> <span class="st"> [Godfrey O'Donnell]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1258), <span class="occ">king of T&iacute;r Conaill</span>, was one of five recorded sons of Domhnall M&oacute;r &Oacute; Domhnaill (<i>d</i>. 1241), king of T&iacute;r Conaill (which comprised most of the modern co. Donegal) and overlord of territories in Fermanagh, Monaghan and northern Sligo; he was grandson to &Eacute;igneach&aacute;n &Oacute; Domhnaill (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1208), first of this dynasty to achieve local kingship. A bardic poem by Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe names Gofraidh's chief residence as Inis Saimh&eacute;ar (Fish Island) at the mouth of the River Erne. It contains this significant remark, &#145;Gofraidh would be similar to Domhnall M&oacute;r if the foreigners did not hold sway&#146;  (Williams, 61). In the thirteenth century a renewed westward expansion by the Anglo-Normans in Ireland saw Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1257) become lord of Sligo, with a speculative grant of the kingdom of T&iacute;r Conaill itself to hold in fee from the earl of Ulster. Fitzgerald's first raids northwards came before the death of Domhnall M&oacute;r and continued through the reign of Gofraidh's (presumably elder) brother Maoilsheachlainn &Oacute; Domhnaill, culminating in the latter's defeat and death at the battle of Ballyshannon in 1247. Kingship of T&iacute;r Conaill was then awarded by the victorious Fitzgerald to Ruaidhr&iacute; &Oacute; Canann&aacute;in, member of an earlier ruling dynasty of the area, also backed by Brian &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, the powerful king of neighbouring T&iacute;r Eoghain, whose western borders had been threatened by &Oacute; Domhnaill expansion.<br>
<br>Gofraidh &Oacute; Domhnaill recovered his inheritance by persuading Maurice Fitzgerald to invade T&iacute;r Conaill yet again in 1248, banish Ruaidhr&iacute; &Oacute; Canann&aacute;in, and install Gofraidh as his vassal-king. When Ruaidhr&iacute; &Oacute; Canann&aacute;in subsequently re-entered the country with a force from T&iacute;r Eoghain, &Oacute; Domhnaill killed him, and another claimant, Niall &Oacute; Canann&aacute;in, was killed by Maurice Fitzgerald in 1250. Once rid of his rivals, Gofraidh &Oacute; Domhnaill proved anything but submissive. According to the annals of the four masters, supported by the contemporary poem mentioned above, he plundered the Anglo-Norman lordship of Sligo in 1249, raided and defeated Brian &Oacute; N&eacute;ill in 1252, and forced submissions from Fermanagh and Br&eacute;ifne (the modern co. Leitrim) in 1256. As a result of &Oacute; Domhnaill's constant warfare, Mag &Eacute;ine (that part of modern co. Donegal lying south of the River Erne) was annexed to the kingdom of T&iacute;r Conaill, though remaining part of Clogher diocese. In 1257 Maurice Fitzgerald died, and &Oacute; Domhnaill promptly brought an expedition to raze his castle of Belleek and invade the Anglo-Norman lordship of Sligo, burning the town itself and killing many of the settlers. A pursuing army of colonists was heavily defeated at Credran, near Drumcliff in Sligo, though &Oacute; Domhnaill himself received a mortal wound there. The four masters, using a literary source, state that Gofraidh was wounded in single combat with Maurice Fitzgerald himself, lingered on his sickbed for another year at Lough Beagh (near Glenveagh Castle, Donegal), and led the troops of T&iacute;r Conaill to a last victory against Brian &Oacute; N&eacute;ill in 1258, while lying on his bier. After the battle, they say, the bier was carried back to Conwal, where Gofraidh died. A late medieval genealogical source states more plausibly that Credran was fought against the sons of Maurice Fitzgerald, that Gofraidh died in Lough Beagh a year later, and that &Oacute; N&eacute;ill invaded as Gofraidh's people were carrying their king on his bier, but was repulsed.<br>
