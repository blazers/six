<span class="headword">Ballinger, Sir  John</span>  (1860&#150;1933), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born in Pontnewynydd, Monmouthshire, on 12 May 1860, the younger son and second of four children of Henry Ballinger of Whitchurch, Herefordshire, a metallurgical engineer, and his wife, Jane Williams (1827&#150;1896) of Llanrumney. His father died in 1866. He was educated at Canton School, Cardiff, and privately until 1875, when he was apprenticed at Cardiff Free Library. In 1880 Ballinger was appointed librarian at Doncaster. Before returning to Cardiff as chief librarian in 1884 he developed journalistic skills, contributing a series &#145;About books&#146; to the <span class="italic">Doncaster Chronicle</span> between 1880 and 1884. In 1888 he married Amy, daughter of Captain David Boughton, master mariner, of Cardiff. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Cardiff's policy of providing school libraries, inaugurated in 1899, and children's reading-halls in branch libraries, evidenced the practice of principles advocated by Ballinger in a stream of papers and pamphlets urging their educational function. Children's literature became an abiding interest. <span class="italic">Books for Village Libraries</span> (with Frank Burgoyne, 1895) and articles on library planning and administration, foreshadowing <span class="italic">The Rate Limit and the Future of Public Libraries</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">Library Politics: a Sequel</span> (1905), reinforced Ballinger's many dynamic contributions to the public libraries movement.<br>
<br>Although Ballinger knew little Welsh, he made a name as a bibliographer by publishing the monumental <span class="italic">Catalogue of Printed Literature in the Welsh Department of Cardiff Free Library</span> (1898), articles on Vicar Prichard of Llandovery (1899) and on the Trefeca printing press (1905), and <span class="italic">The Bible in Wales</span> (1906), all with the assistance of James Ifano Jones. Bibliography and acquisitions of valuable collections of Welsh books and manuscripts for Cardiff led to his appointment in 1908 as first librarian of the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth, which was opened in 1909.<br>
<br>There Ballinger's reputation as an administrator and expository bibliographer increased with the publication of reports and papers on the library and its educational role, and with his contributions to the south Wales press, the journal of the Welsh Bibliographical Society, which he served as treasurer (1910&#150;24), and <span class="italic">Y Cymmrodor</span>. He pioneered the historiographic use of ephemera in <span class="italic">Gleanings from a Printer's File</span> (1928). Assisted by William Llewellyn Davies and other Welsh scholars, he prepared new editions of <span class="italic">The History of the Gwydir Family</span> (1927), and <span class="italic">Basilikon Doron</span> (1604), and four seventeenth-century Welsh religious books for the University of Wales press board, on which he served from 1922 until 1930. He co-directed, then directed, the Library Association's summer schools at Aberystwyth from 1917 until 1929.<br>
<br>Ballinger was awarded an honorary MA by the University of Wales in 1909 and he was appointed CBE in 1920. He served as president of the Library Association (1922&#150;3), was elected an honorary fellow of the association in 1929, and, just before he retired, was knighted in 1930. In 1932 the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion awarded him its medal for services to Wales in the field of Celtic bibliography. In private an autocrat, Ballinger was popular with the public and its political representatives, whom he impressed with his authority, journalism, and the exhibitions he organized; but, sadly, his lack of humour and austere sense of mission alienated many of his associates and he intimidated his subordinates.<br>
<br>Until he died at Hawarden, Flintshire, where he lived, on 8 January 1933 Ballinger helped organize the St Deiniol's Library of Henry, Baron Gladstone of Hawarden. He was buried at St Deiniol's, Hawarden, and was survived by his wife.<br>
