<span class="headword">Jowett,  Frederick William</span>  (1864&#150;1944), <span class="occ">socialist and politician</span>, was born on 31 January 1864 at 108 Clayton Street, Bradford, one of eight children (three of whom died in infancy) of Nathan Jowett, cotton warp dresser, and his wife, Emma Gerry. Born into a working-class household, his education was limited, and at the age of eight he started work in the Bradford textile trade as a half-timer, before transferring to full-time employment at the age of thirteen. His education was continued through a mixture of self-directed reading and attendance at classes at the mechanics' institute and the technical college. He made rapid progress in the textile trade and became a power-loom overlooker at the age of nineteen. On 19 July 1884 he married Emily Foster, the daughter of a Bradford wool waste dealer, and through his marriage he became a partner in a small textile firm. However, by this point his interests were already more clearly related to trade unionism and the infant labour movement, which were to dominate the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>In 1886 Jowett joined William Morris's Socialist League, and on the closure of the Bradford branch in 1889 he was a founder member and secretary of the Labour Electoral Association, an organization committed to the selection and election of working men as parliamentary candidates. His acceptance of socialism grew out of reading Carlyle, Ruskin, and Morris (influences which he later acknowledged in the <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, June 1906, 575), combined with observing working-class life: his direct experience of the social, economic, and political situation in late Victorian Bradford dominated his political career. In that period the textile industry was undergoing increasing difficulties, which led to worsening labour relations and culminated in the Manningham mills strike (December 1890&#150;April 1891). Out of that strike emerged a growing demand for independent working-class political activity, which, faced by locally a conservative Liberalism and a weak trade unionism, led to the formation in the spring of 1891 of the Bradford Labour Union, subsequently the Bradford Independent Labour Party. Jowett, who was a founder and first president of the Bradford labour church, was a key figure in this burgeoning movement; in November 1892 he was the party's first candidate for Bradford town council to win a contested election. For the next fifteen years his major sphere of activity was Bradford town council, and from 1897 the city council. As chairman of the sanitary committee and later the health committee, he was a driving force behind municipal socialism, particularly municipal housing. His thinking in this field was outlined in his book <span class="italic">The Socialist and the City</span> (1907).<br>
<br>But even before this publication Jowett's main area of activity had moved to Westminster. He had been a delegate to the founding conference of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1893, and had stood as an ILP candidate for Bradford West in 1900, when he was narrowly defeated. He was elected in 1906 and represented Bradford West until the 1918 general election. Although he remained deeply involved in Bradford issues, for much of the remainder of his political life his primary role was in the House of Commons and within the central administration of the ILP. He wrote a parliamentary column in <span class="italic">The Clarion</span> until 1909 and then in the <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>.<br>
<br>Small in stature, Jowett was a fiery speaker who, unlike many of his contemporaries, retained his radicalism until the end of his life. In the period before the First World War he was an active spokesman in parliament on most issues affecting working-class life, notably the provision of school meals. During this period two of the key issues which were to dominate much of his political thinking emerged. The first was his concern to democratize parliament, for which he advocated a central role for committees of MPs to scrutinize all legislative and administrative matters relating to each department of state, as described in <span class="italic">What's the use of Parliament?</span> (1909) and in his evidence to the select committee on House of Commons procedure (1913&#150;14). The second was his active opposition to secret diplomacy in international relations. On the left of the party, he was strongly suspicious of Ramsay MacDonald, and of attempts to stifle the rights of Labour members to vote according to conscience. He campaigned against the <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span> in 1911, objecting to its contributory principle, and this stand placed him at odds with the majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party. As a member of the select committee appointed to investigate the Putumayo scandal, he was deeply impressed by the evidence of the exploitation of the local labour force in the Amazon rubber collecting industry. Having previously been chairman of the ILP in 1909&#150;10 he was re-elected for a further three-year term in 1914.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Jowett passionately opposed war. He spoke out against the South African War, and during the First World War he was a bitter opponent of its conduct. He was never a pacifist, though, and believed in the right of national defence. As well as being a member of the executive of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95108', "Union of Democratic Control")</script>, he spoke out against secret diplomacy, which he believed responsible for the outbreak of war, and was a constant advocate for British war aims to be defined and peace negotiations to be entered into.<br>
<br>Defeated at the 1918 general election, Jowett concentrated on his work within the central party apparatus: he was the ILP representative on the Labour Party executive and was chairman of the Labour Party in 1921&#150;2. During this period he was often a member of overseas delegations: he made visits to Hungary to investigate reports of a &#145;White terror&#146;, to Geneva for the International Socialist Conference held to consider the post-war situation, and to Ireland to inquire into the policies of the British state during the war of independence. Jowett and his fellow Labour Party delegates recommended the withdrawal of British forces and the recognition of the right of the Irish to self-determination.<br>
<br>In 1922 Jowett was elected for Bradford East, and in parliament he was chairman of the public accounts committee. After being re-elected at the general election of 1923, he became in January 1924 the first commissioner of works, with a seat in the first Labour cabinet. With John Wheatley he refused to wear morning dress and a top hat when receiving the seals of office from the king. As commissioner of works he was best remembered for authorizing Epstein's statue of <span class="italic">Rima</span> as the central feature of the W. H. Hudson memorial in Hyde Park. He advocated socialist policies and opposed collaboration with the Liberal Party to keep the government in office.<br>
<br>Jowett lost his Bradford seat at the general election of 1924, and during the next five years out of parliament he was closely associated with the leftward movement of the ILP, in conjunction with James Maxton and John Wheatley. He was again chairman of the ILP (1925&#150;6) and was party treasurer from 1927 until his death. His thinking as expressed in the pamphlet <span class="italic">Parliament or Palaver?</span> (1926) returned to the need for the democratization of both the party and parliament, and was coupled with a deep hostility to cabinet government as a result of his experience of the first Labour government. He restated his arguments for the reorganization of parliament on the basis of a committee system, and carried these proposals at the ILP conference in 1926. But they were opposed by Ramsay MacDonald and other Labour leaders who feared that they would make parliament a permanent coalition, and would emasculate a future Labour government  (Morrison, 169). He worked for the ILP's &#145;socialism in our time&#146; programme, and was a powerful supporter of the miners both during 1926 and after. He firmly opposed another west Yorkshire labour pioneer, Ben Turner, in his involvement in the Mond&#150;Turner talks, which were concerned to develop a more co-operative relationship between employers and trade unions in the context of pressures for industrial rationalization.<br>
<br>Jowett regained his seat at Bradford East in the general election of 1929. During the second Labour government he was associated with the left ILP rebels: he proposed a socialist amendment to the king's speech at the opening of the session in 1930 and opposed restrictions on entitlement to unemployment benefit. He also refused to sign a declaration that, if elected, all candidates should accept the standing orders of the Parliamentary Labour Party. For Jowett, as for a small number of MPs sponsored by the ILP, such a declaration would prohibit support in parliament for ILP policy when this was in conflict with the position of the majority of Labour MPs. He was defeated in the general election of 1931 and never sat in parliament again. At a special conference at Jowett Hall in Bradford (opened in 1927 by James Maxton in his honour) in July 1932, the ILP disaffiliated from the Labour Party. Jowett recognized that this was likely to lead to an increased marginalization of the ILP, but believed that commitment to principle was more important. The issue of standing orders was the basis of Jowett's support for disaffiliation. He did not share some ILP members' beliefs that disaffiliation in a context of capitalist crisis would permit the party to become an effective revolutionary alternative to both the Communist and Labour parties. For Jowett, this period, following the death of his wife of over forty-five years in September 1931, was not a happy one. Politically, he remained committed to the parliamentary road to socialism, and was appalled by the ILP's subsequent flirtation with ultra-left tendencies and willingness to co-operate with communists. He stood as an ILP candidate for Bradford East in 1935 but was defeated.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Bradford was Jowett's major focus of activity, and he wrote a weekly article of 1000&#150;1500 words for the Bradford <span class="italic">ILP News</span>. In these articles he reflected on his political career and pushed forward a number of key issues: the reform of parliament, the &#145;living wage&#146; and &#145;socialism in our time&#146;, anti-militarism, and&#151;arising out of the experience of the second Labour government&#151;an increasing concern with the role of finance and the need for a clear socialist policy in this area. He never embraced the populism of the ILP Clydesiders and was unusual on the left in taking a powerful interest in the reform of existing political institutions.<br>
<br>In 1939 Jowett opposed the declaration of war, once again arguing for the clear articulation of war aims and proposing immediate peace negotiations. He died at his home, 10 Grantham Terrace, Bradford, on 1 February 1944, survived by two daughters, a son, and five grandchildren. He was cremated at Scholemoor cemetery. His memorial service was conducted in Bradford's nineteenth-century cathedral of nonconformity, Horton Lane Congregational Chapel, where James Maxton paid a glowing tribute to a friend and colleague, referring to him as one of the giants of the labour movement.<br>
