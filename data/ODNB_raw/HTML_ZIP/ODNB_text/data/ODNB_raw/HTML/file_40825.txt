<span class="headword">Pedersen,  Mikael</span>  (1855&#150;1929), <span class="occ">engineer and designer of bicycles</span>, was born on 25 October 1855 at Marbjerg, near Roskilde in Denmark, the eldest of six children of Peder Hansen, farmer, and his wife, Karen Mathiasdatter. His parents were both Danish.<br>
<br>Pedersen was known in Marbjerg as an ingenious and musical child. After schooling in Fl&oslash;ng, he became apprenticed to the Maglekilde machinery factory in Roskilde where in 1878 he produced important improvements to cream separators. By 1878 he had moved to the Roskilde machinery factory where again he improved the separator design to create the famous Alexandra model. In 1889, Robert Lister of R. A. Lister &amp; Co. Ltd, agricultural engineers of Dursley in Gloucestershire, acquired the selling rights of this model. However, the design was still imperfect, and after an accident in which the rotating bowl broke and killed a man, Lister invited Pedersen to Dursley to sort out the problem. Manufacture then began in Dursley itself. In 1893 Pedersen settled in Dursley.<br>
<br>At about this time Pedersen, who was a cycling enthusiast, invented a hammock saddle to make riding more comfortable and also designed a triangulated cycle frame to support it. In a small former woollen mill at the bottom of his garden in Dursley he refined his cycle design and attempted, unsuccessfully, to interest established cycle makers in manufacturing it. In consequence of this failure he opened his own factory in Dursley in 1899 under the name of the Dursley Pedersen Cycle Company.<br>
<br>Pedersen's talent as a designer flowered during this period. He built multi-seat cycles and produced new designs for many cycle parts and accessories. These latter included one of the first variable gears, a folding cycle which he vainly hoped would be of use in the South African War, and also a motorcycle. In 1905, because of financial problems, the company was taken over by R. A. Lister; cycle production continued until 1914. During the First World War Pedersen made thread gauges used in munitions production and is credited with the invention of the ML magneto which was used in most British aircraft of this time.<br>
<br>Like many inventors, Pedersen was obsessive and moody. He could be seen, lost in thought, striding the streets of Dursley, with his head down in his beard. At other times he was highly sociable, enjoying parties and holding musical evenings at which instruments of his own invention were played. He was said to be generous to his workforce and their families. Although involved with three women, it is not known whether he married any of them. With the last, Ingeborg, the relationship produced three boys and a girl.<br>
<br>In 1920 Pedersen returned penniless to Denmark where in 1928 he entered Den Gamle By, an old people's home in Copenhagen. There he died of old age on 22 October 1929. He was buried in Bispebjerg cemetery, Copenhagen. In 1995 the remains from his unmarked grave were brought to England and on 21 September reinterred in Dursley cemetery.<br>
<br>Although Pedersen's cycle had no real influence on the mass production cycle industry, his designs later became famed for their elegance and eccentricity. In the late 1970s interest in the Pedersen frame revived, when new machines to his designs were built, first in Denmark, then in England and Germany.<br>
