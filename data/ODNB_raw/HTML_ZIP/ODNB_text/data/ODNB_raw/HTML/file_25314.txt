<span class="headword">Shelley,  Samuel</span>  (1756&#150;1808), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born in Whitechapel, London, in August 1756. He entered the Royal Academy Schools on 21 March 1774 (their records state that he was &#145;17 last August&#146;) but he had first exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1773. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1774 to 1804, in that period missing only the 1775 exhibition. Through a judicious use of frames containing between five and ten miniature portraits Shelley exhibited well over 200 works. Initially he exhibited conventional miniature portraits but from 1780 he began exhibiting subject pictures.<br>
<br>Shelley was self-taught as a miniaturist but was greatly influenced by the RA and its president, Sir Joshua Reynolds, who encouraged students towards history painting. Shelley aspired to be more than a painter of faces, hoping to demonstrate his invention and originality through painting subject pictures. He was probably equally encouraged by ventures such as the Shakspeare Gallery and Thomas Macklin's Poets' Gallery, which commissioned oil paintings based on subjects from Shakespeare and the great English poets. Reynolds contributed a painting, <span class="italic">Macbeth and the Witches</span>, which was the subject that Shelley chose for an exhibition piece at the RA in 1782 (V&amp;A).<br>
<br>Shelley collaborated successfully with engravers such as Bartolozzi. A major project was the <span class="italic">Cabinet of Genius</span> (1787), a collection of poems by writers such as Gray, Pope, Thomson, and Goldsmith, each accompanied by an original design by Shelley. These were engraved by C. Taylor and W. Nutter in an oval format with a &#145;frame&#146; in imitation of conventional oval portrait miniatures, and usually of a single figure, such as Sylvia from Pope's &#145;Summer&#146;. The poems were published in batches of twelve but &#145;Gentlemen [could] bind any numbers together to make a volume, and in any order they please&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cabinet of Genius</span>, 1, 1787, ii), and its success led to a second volume. This was a massive undertaking and the sixty-six designs by Shelley are of variable quality.<br>
<br>Shelley worked prolifically on developing his ideas. The Royal Academy has the drawing <span class="italic">A Vestal Virgin Attending a Sacred Flame</span>, in pencil and watercolour. (Foskett refers to &#145;letters and drawings&#146; held by the RA but only one drawing by Shelley and one brief letter from him, referring to and accompanying a drawing by another artist, are in the Royal Academy collection  (Foskett, 1.504).) The Scottish National Gallery has sketches of symbolical figures in oil on paper and the Victoria and Albert Museum has sketchbooks in which Shelley worked out his compositional ideas. Shelley also belonged to an informal sketching society referred to by Farington in 1804: &#145;for four years past [they have] been accustomed to meet once a week during the winter season at each others houses &hellip; to sketch and converse upon Art&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 6.2271).<br>
<br>But while Shelley's studio contained evidence of serious study&#151;in the form of Livy, Ripa, and others&#151;Shelley's designs, especially those for the <span class="italic">Cabinet of Genius</span>, would rank more as pretty, &#145;fancy&#146; pictures than as rigorous &#145;histories&#146;. While his prints were successful his subject miniatures failed to find a market. The public was interested only in miniatures of loved ones and the famous. When Shelley died his studio contained many unsold subject miniatures.<br>
<br>Shelley was however a highly successful portraitist. He was employed at the court of George III and Queen Charlotte, although he was not accorded an official position there. He was ranked among the most well known and fashionable miniaturists of his time. The young miniaturist Andrew Robertson reported in a letter to his brother in 1802 that Shee had stated that if he pursued his ambition he would exceed Cosway and Shelley, the standard to be beaten. A number of Shelley's most beautiful and compositionally complex portraits are notable for their rich, heavily gummed colour in imitation of oil, such as <span class="italic">The Misses Annabella and Mary Crawford</span> (1782; V&amp;A). But most of his miniatures found in public collections and in salerooms are conventional in size, composition, and colouring.<br>
<br>Farington reports that Shelley was very exercised about being chosen by the Royal Academicians as an associate  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.1042). He was passed over on two occasions, which probably exacerbated his frustration with the lack of public interest in his &#145;histories&#146; and his suspicion that his work was at a disadvantage next to the oil paintings which dominated the RA exhibitions. In 1804 Shelley and W. F. Wells encouraged seven other watercolour artists to found the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96320', "Society of Painters in Water Colours")</script> (subsequently known as the Old Watercolour Society) and at a meeting on 30 November 1804 he was made treasurer. The first exhibition opened on 22 April 1805, and in the period up to 1808 Shelley submitted sixty-three paintings. A large watercolour on paper, <span class="italic">Memory Gathering the Flowers Mowed Down by Time</span> (V&amp;A), appeared at the first exhibition. Shelley was the only miniaturist to join the society and his fellow members were mostly landscape artists. Miniature painting had always had a place in the main exhibition room at the RA but landscape watercolours were relegated to small anterooms. Shelley's fellow watercolourists believed that in exhibiting portraits at the new society Shelley was not promoting the objectives of the society and so voted to exclude him from a share of the profits. Shelley resigned as treasurer in December 1806.<br>
<br>Shelley lived in London all his working life, at 7 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, from 1784 to 1794 and at 6 George Street, Hanover Square, from 1794 until his death there on 22 December 1808. (Coincidentally the dowager Lady Shelley died on the same day, leading some writers to suggest that there is confusion over the date of Shelley's death.) Edward Nash and Alexander Robertson were his pupils. The sale catalogue of his collection of books, prints, drawings, and miniatures, organized by his friend the auctioneer Peter Coxe on 22 March 1809, pays tribute to him as &#145;Nobleman, Gentleman, Collector, Connoisseur and Artist&#146;, and states that he &#145;Leaves his best Image in his Works enshrined&#146;.<br>
