<span class="headword">Carlyle,  John</span>, first Lord Carlyle  (<em>d.</em> 1501), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, came from a family of Annandale gentry. His father, William, acquired the Dumfriesshire barony of Torthorwald through marriage, but John was the first of his line to gain real prominence. First recorded in 1433, he received formal ownership of Torthorwald in 1449 (although tenancy did not follow until his father's death in 1463), was knighted in 1449 or 1450, and enjoyed royal favour from the late 1450s. His early career was probably the result of Douglas patronage, but following their collapse in 1452&#150;5 he emerged as an important royal agent in the south-west. He was keeper of Threave Castle in 1458, captain of Lochmaben Castle in 1460&#150;64, and justiciar in Annandale for the duke of Albany in 1465, while he also maintained his position at court, becoming master of the queen's stable in 1460&#150;61.<br>
<br>Carlyle was one of James III's closest supporters in the 1470s. He was created Lord Carlyle between October 1473 and July 1474, probably close to 3 December 1473, when Torthorwald was erected into a free burgh of barony. On 31 October 1477 the king granted him Drumcoll, Dumfriesshire, in one of his few major grants of patronage in that decade. This was in reward for Carlyle's services, particularly in France in 1473&#150;4 at the time of the Anglo-Scottish peace. In the period 1476&#150;81 he was very active in central and local crown administration as a regular witness to charters under the great seal, an auditor of exchequer, a member of the lords of council, a parliamentarian, and a custumar of Kirkcudbright and Wigtown. Importantly, he was involved in receiving Edward IV's dowry payments to James III for the proposed marriage and alliance negotiated in 1474, which suggests sympathy for this controversial policy. Following the crisis of 1482, however, he was less prominent in the 1480s, though he returned to court in 1487 and was probably in James III's army at Sauchieburn in 1488. His loyalty to the defeated monarch may explain his apparent absence from public affairs in the next reign. Carlyle died between 12 January and 3 March 1501, probably at Torthorwald. He was married three times: first to Elizabeth Kirkpatrick (marriage contract of 1433); second to Janet, of unknown family, from before 1476 to <i>c</i>.1484; and third to Margaret Douglas (<i>d</i>. after 22 Dec 1509), widow of Herbert Maxwell, from before February 1493. He had six children and was succeeded by his grandson, William.<br>
