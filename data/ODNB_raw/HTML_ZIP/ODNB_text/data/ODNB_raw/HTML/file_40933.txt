<span class="headword">Clinton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Knevitt]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, countess of Lincoln  (1574?&#150;1630?), <span class="occ">noblewoman and writer</span>, was the daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Knevitt 
    (Knyvett; <i>d</i>. 1598)
   of Charlton, Wiltshire, and Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Sir James Stumpe. Some time after 21 September 1584 (when the earl of Huntington wrote that he hoped the match would soon be settled) she married Thomas Clinton (otherwise Fiennes), Lord Clinton (1567/8&#150;1619). The early years of the marriage were not easy. In August 1597, writing on the occasion of the recovery of his daughter-in-law, the privy council wrote to the earl of Lincoln reminding him &#145;what it is for young folks to want&#146;. Prompted by the queen, they asked him to provide &#145;some convenient house where the young lord and lady may live with their children&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>). Elizabeth writes of having had eighteen children; at least nine survived infancy (five daughters and four sons).<br>
<br>Clinton succeeded his father as third earl of Lincoln in 1616, and died three years later at his castle at Tattershall, Lincolnshire, on 15 January 1619. He in turn was succeeded by his third, but first surviving son, Theophilus (<i>c</i>.1600&#150;1667), who married Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of William Fiennes, first Viscount Saye and Sele in 1620. At the time of the third earl's inquest (1620), the countess and her three younger sons were living at Sempringham, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>In 1622 the dowager countess published a short tract on breastfeeding, <span class="italic">The Countesse of Lincolnes Nurserie</span>. She dedicated the work to her daughter-in-law, who, she writes, &#145;doe goe on with that loving act of a loving mother&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nurserie</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>). She herself had not nursed any of her babies, and writes in contrition, having been &#145;partly &hellip; overruled by anothers authority, and partily deceived by some ill counsell, &amp; partly I had not so well considered of my duty&#146;  (ibid., 16). She confesses that she believes &#145;the death of one or two of my little Babes came by the defalt of their nurses&#146;  (ibid., 18). Unpretentious in tone and unpreachy, firmly anchored in biblical sources, the dowager countess justifies her writing straightforwardly:<blockquote>Because it hath pleased God to blesse me with many children, and so caused me to observe many things falling out to mothers, and to their children; I thought good to open my minde concerning a speciall matter belonging to all childe-bearing women, seriously to consider of. (ibid., 1)</blockquote>She discusses numerous worthy biblical women who nursed their children, and sets forth rather individual interpretations of biblical precepts and of God's works as proofs of her thesis. She ends by asserting that it is the duty of older women to exhort younger ones:<blockquote>Thinke alwaies, that having the child at your breast, and having it in your armes, you have <i>Gods blessing</i> there. For children are Gods blessings. Thinke again how your Babe crying for your breast, sucking hartily the milke out of it, and growing by it, is the <i>Lords owne instruction</i>, every houre, and every day, that you are suckling it, instructing you to shew that you are his <i>new borne Babes</i>, by your earnest desire after his word; &amp; the syncere doctrine thereof. (ibid., 20)</blockquote>Clinton describes the <span class="italic">Nurserie</span> as &#145;the first worke of mine that ever came in print&#146;  (sig. A2<i>r</i>), and it is her only known work. In 1625 Theophilus brought a suit in chancery against his mother in her capacity as guardian of the three younger sons. She probably died in 1630.<br>
