<span class="headword">Kenney,  Peter James</span>  (1779&#150;1841), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Dublin, probably at 28 Drogheda Street, on 7 July 1779, the son of Peter Kenney (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1740&#150;1810) and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Molloy, who ran a small business together. Kenney's known siblings were Anne Mary, who joined the convent of the Sisters of St Clare, and an elder brother, or half-brother, Michael, who set up an apothecary shop in Waterford. Peter was apprenticed for a while to a coach-maker, and was educated in the schools run for poor children and apprentices by the former Jesuit priest Dr Thomas Betagh, in cellars and back lanes in Dublin. He was impressed by Betagh and another former Jesuit, Richard Callaghan, and this influenced his choice of career. The Jesuits had been suppressed in 1773, except in Belorussia; their continuation there was formally recognized by the papacy in 1801, which gave hope of a general restoration of the order. As a result Father Callaghan sent Kenney and some other young men to Carlow College to prepare for the priesthood. From there they were sent to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, which was run by former English Jesuits, where they commenced their noviciate. Kenney made an impression almost immediately with his ability, sound piety, and eloquence, despite suffering from asthma. Following the recognition of the society in Sicily, Kenney was sent there in 1808 to complete his studies and for the sake of his health.<br>
<br>The island of Sicily was in danger of invasion by Napoleon, and depended on the British navy and British military garrison for its defence. For this reason, Kenney's ordination and that of his colleagues was brought forward: he was ordained on 4 December 1808, but remained in Sicily until 1811. It was a period of cultural and spiritual development, and his ability and general maturity so impressed the Jesuit superior that he termed him &#145;L'incomparable P. Kenney&#146;  (Morrissey, 64). During his time in Sicily he was chosen to act as interpreter in a British naval expedition to rescue the pope from imprisonment by Napoleon. However, the pope refused to leave Rome. Kenney and an English Jesuit friend, Thomas Glover, also acted as chaplains to Catholic soldiers and sailors in the British force on the island, many of whom were Irish. Their efforts were terminated by the intolerance of &#145;Scotch generals&#146;  (ibid., 58&#150;9). Kenney's and Glover's reports about the matter gave rise to questions in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Kenney returned to Ireland on 31 August 1811 and found himself much in demand. Dr Daniel Murray, bishop of Dublin, sought his assistance at Maynooth College, the national seminary, where there were problems with morale and discipline. Under Murray as president and Kenney as vice-president, the college was transformed within a year. Kenney's sermons and spiritual meditations were written down by students and passed from hand to hand for years. In 1814 he founded Clongowes Wood College, co. Kildare, which became the leading boarding college for the middle-class Catholic population. Five years later he opened a house at Rahan, near Tullamore, in the midlands, which subsequently became St Stanislaus College, and then a small church in Dublin, which became in turn the forerunner of the large church of St Francis Xavier at Gardiner Street and of the well-known day school Belvedere College. The Jesuit order was restored universally in 1814, and Kenney was appointed superior of the Irish mission. Despite his achievements, he was considered too demanding and strict by some fellow Jesuits and was replaced after four years. His standing with the Jesuit-general, however, led to his being sent in 1819 to North America to sort out the problems of disunity among the Jesuits of different nationalities working there.<br>
<br>Kenney's visitation of the Jesuits, mainly in Maryland, proved successful. He brought order into the temporal administration, introduced customs and structures which promoted order and team effort, revitalized Georgetown University, and prepared for the future by approving the sending of six young men to Rome to further their studies. On his return to Ireland, he was appointed superior once more, and soon achieved further distinction as a preacher and spiritual guide. He played a prominent part in assisting many religious congregations, and was particularly close to the founders of the new religious bodies&#151;the Irish Sisters of Charity, the Irish Christian Brothers, and the Sisters of Loreto. From 1830 to 1833 he went once more to the United States of America on behalf of the Jesuit-general, this time as superior of the entire mission, which by now had spread southward into the vast area then termed Missouri. They were years of endeavour, long journeys, periods of ill health, and eventual achievement. He helped to consolidate the universities at Georgetown and St Louis, promoted harmony and good order across the vast territory, established better management in the estates which had supported much of the early work, improved the living conditions of the slaves who worked the estates, and raised the question of managing without their forced labour. He also laid the ground for the renewal of the society's mission to the North American Indians. As he left Maryland was raised to the status of a province of the society, and Missouri was acknowledged an independent mission. On the day of his departure, 11 July 1833, the diary for Georgetown University contains the entry: &#145;Never has a man lived among us whom all without exception so loved and reverenced&#146;  (Morrissey, 338). His standing with the diocesan clergy and bishops is indicated by his name's having been put forward at different times for the bishoprics of New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati.<br>
<br>When Kenney returned to Ireland, a very tired man, he was appointed once more the overall superior. This post he tried to combine with pastoral work at the Gardiner Street Church. It was too much. Owing to the constant demands from people, clergy, religious, and bishops, for confession, sermons, and spiritual direction, he neglected his reports to Rome and was unable to act adequately as provincial. He was removed from the position, much to his relief, in May 1836. His pastoral endeavours led to his being termed &#145;the modern apostle of Dublin&#146; and &#145;to an incalculable extent, of Ireland at large&#146;  (Meagher, 93). In 1841 he was chosen by his fellow Jesuits to represent them at a general congregation of the procurators of the society at Rome in October. He set out despite very severe asthma and a strained heart. After a journey marked by rain, floods, and other hardships, he arrived at Rome exhausted, and after some days suffered a stroke. He died on 19 November, and was buried under the high altar at the Jesuit church of the Ges&ugrave; in Rome. When the news reached Dublin on 3 December, large crowds mourned his passing. Kenney was one of the most eminent preachers, theologians, and spiritual directors in Ireland in the first half of the nineteenth century, and he also had very considerable influence as an educationist and through his foundations. His greatest contribution to the development of the Catholic church, however, was probably in the United States of America. Manuscript copies of his &#145;Meditations&#146; have been preserved, as have parts of his American diaries.<br>
