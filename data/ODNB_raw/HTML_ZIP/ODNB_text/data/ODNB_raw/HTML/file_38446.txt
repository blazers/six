<span class="headword">Macdonogh, Sir  George Mark Watson</span>  (1865&#150;1942), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 4 March 1865, the son of George Valentine Macdonogh, deputy inspector of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich. Macdonogh was commissioned lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 5 July 1884. Of considerable intellectual ability and with a penetrating analytical mind, the diffident and taciturn Macdonogh, who was to spend most of his military career in staff appointments without seeing active service, was promoted captain on 22 October 1892. He and his fellow engineer, James Edmonds, passed the entrance examinations for the Staff College, Camberley, in 1896 so far ahead of other candidates that the publication of results was delayed and the usual order varied to try and conceal the degree of their intellectual superiority. Neither found the course stimulating and, while Edmonds used the opportunity to write a history of the American Civil War, Macdonogh qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in 1897. An excellent linguist, Macdonogh married a Finnish woman, Aline Borgstr&ouml;m of Helsingfors (Helsinki), on 8 November 1898, and became fluent in a number of Scandinavian languages; their only son died in 1915.<br>
<br>After graduation from Camberley, Macdonogh's first staff appointment was as deputy assistant adjutant-general in Dublin from November 1898 to November 1899, and this was followed by that of secretary to the School of Military Engineering at Chatham from December 1899 to August 1903, in the course of which Macdonogh received his majority on 1 April 1901. He was then deputy assistant quartermaster-general for the Thames district; but he found his real vocation when appointed general staff officer, grade 3 (GSO3), in the War Office on 27 October 1906; he advanced to GSO2 in January 1908 and to GSO1 in December 1912, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 22 January 1909 and colonel on 30 October 1912. Macdonogh was responsible with Edmonds, whom he succeeded in charge of MO5 in the military operations directorate, for the drafting of measures to control aliens in the event of war. However, Macdonogh enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the director of military operations, Henry Wilson, who distrusted Macdonogh for his conversion from Methodism to Roman Catholicism. It was a distrust heightened by Macdonogh's being one of the few officers in the War Office prepared to contemplate coercing Ulster into accepting Irish home rule during the Curragh incident in March 1914.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in August 1914 Macdonogh was posted as GSO1 for intelligence to the general headquarters (GHQ) of the expeditionary force, and on 7 November 1914 he became brigadier-general, general staff. Macdonogh served GHQ well, especially during the first battle of Ypres and again when providing timely warning of a forthcoming gas attack on the Second Army in December 1915. He was summoned back to the War Office on 3 January 1916 as director of military intelligence with the rank of major-general. In this capacity he pushed for operations which would contribute to the weakening of German domestic morale, presenting a paper to this effect to the war cabinet in October 1917. He had created the propaganda department, M17(b), as soon as he reached the War Office and from the summer of 1917 onwards carefully orchestrated what became a model subversion campaign. Macdonogh's agents and painstaking methodology provided him with an extremely accurate picture of the state of the German army so that by May 1917 he had compiled an entire order of battle for their forces in the west with the exception of a single <i>Landwehr</i> unit. He was also able to predict the date, time, and location of the German spring offensive in March 1918. However, Macdonogh was distrusted by Sir Douglas Haig and by Haig's chief of intelligence, John Charteris, not only because of his Catholicism but also because he did not share their over-optimistic assessments of the imminent collapse of the German army. Thus Haig recorded in his diary on 15 October 1917 that Macdonogh &#145;is a Roman Catholic and is (perhaps unconsciously) influenced by information which reaches him from tainted [that is, Catholic] sources&#146;  (Haig MSS). In turn, Macdonogh had considerable doubts about Haig's strategy, and engaged in a particularly acrimonious correspondence with Charteris, whom Macdonogh regarded as &#145;a dangerous fool&#146;  (Kirke MSS).<br>
<br>Macdonogh was appointed adjutant-general with the rank of temporary lieutenant-general on 11 September 1918, substantive rank as lieutenant-general coming on 1 January 1919. He was briefly considered as a possible liaison officer to the White Russian army of Admiral Kolchak, but remained adjutant-general until 10 September 1922, and retired from the army on 11 September 1925. For his wartime services Macdonogh was created CB in 1915 and KCMG in 1917, the appointment as KCB following in 1920 and the GBE on his retirement.<br>
<br>Macdonogh then entered business, held a variety of directorships in banking and manufacturing, and became president of the Federation of British Industries in 1933&#150;4. He was also active in a number of institutions such as the Zoological Society of London and the Royal Institute of International Affairs, while his interest in the plight of his wife's country brought him the presidency of the Anglo-Finnish Society, the vice-presidency of the Finland Fund, and membership of the Finnish Aid Bureau in 1940. He was also a commissioner for the Imperial War Graves Commission, a member of the royal commission on local government from 1923 to 1929, and, between 1939 and 1941, a member of the central committee for the regulation of prices. Macdonogh died in the Memorial Hospital, Teddington, London, on 10 July 1942.<br>
