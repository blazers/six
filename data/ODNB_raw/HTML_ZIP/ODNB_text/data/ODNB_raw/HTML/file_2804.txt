<span class="headword">Bolton,  James Jay</span>  (1824&#150;1863), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 11 February 1824 at Southdown College, near Weymouth, the fifth son of Robert Bolton, nonconformist minister, and his wife, a daughter of the Revd William Jay of Bath. His early years were spent at Henley-on-Thames, where his father was a minister. At the age of twelve he went with his parents to America, where circumstances placed his father in charge of an episcopal congregation at Christ Church, Pelham, New York. He was educated at Dr Muhlenburg's, College Point, New York, after staying for some time at Brook Farm, New Rochelle, and Pelham. He returned to England, and entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1844. He obtained a scholarship in his first year, and took a BA degree in 1848. After taking orders in 1848 he was curate of Saffron Walden from 1849 to 1851, and of St Michael's, Chester Square, Pimlico, from 1851 to 1852. In 1853 he was appointed to the incumbency of St Paul's Episcopal Chapel, Kilburn, where he remained until his death. On 30 June 1853 he married Lydia Louisa, third daughter of the Revd W. W. Pym, rector of Willian, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Bolton's faith was strongly evangelical, and he excelled as a children's preacher. His brother, W. J. Bolton, arranged and published two series of his <span class="italic">Selected Sermons</span> in 1863 and 1866. Bolton also contributed extensively to the <span class="italic">Family Treasury</span>, the <span class="italic">Sunday Scholars and Teachers' Magazine</span>, and similar children's publications. He published several other religious works, not all for children. Among the most significant were <span class="italic">Fragments of the Great Diamond Set for Young People: being Addresses to Children</span> (1856) and <span class="italic">Life Lessons, or, Scriptural Truths Illustrated</span> (1862). Bolton died at the parsonage, Kilburn, on 8 April 1863.<br>
