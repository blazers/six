<span class="headword">Cole,  Abdiah</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1602&#150;1664), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was a prolific translator of medical books, of whose career little is known. He must have been born late in the sixteenth century, and is probably the Abdiah Cole of Yorkshire admitted as a scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1602, who graduated BA in 1604 and MA in 1607, was a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, from 1611 to 1618, and graduated BD in 1616. He was incorporated at Oxford in 1611 and was instituted as rector of Ashington with Buncton, Sussex, in 1615 but was deprived for simony in 1619. He apparently took up medicine about 1612, since he is described on the title page of his revised edition of Nicholas Culpeper's <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia Londinensis</span> (1661) as having &#145;practised physick forty-nine years&#146;. He appears to have passed the middle part of his life abroad, since he is said on the same title page to have &#145;lived above thirty years out of his own country&#146;, and to have &#145;seen the practice of France, Italy, Germany, Turkey and the Indies&#146;. In the preface to his translation of Lazare Rivi&egrave;re's <span class="italic">The Practice of Physick</span> (1655) he is said to have spent &#145;twenty-nine years in the service of three of the greatest princes in Europe&#146;. He describes himself as &#145;doctor of physick and the liberal arts&#146;, but where he obtained this degree is unknown. He did not belong to the College of Physicians. In addition to the above-mentioned edition of Culpeper's <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia Londinensis</span>, his name is associated with Culpeper's in numerous translations of standard continental medical works published between 1655 and 1664 purporting to have been originally written by Culpeper and left unpublished at his death in 1654. Cole's role was, therefore, presumably largely editorial. The fact that all the works were printed and sold by Peter Cole suggests a possible relationship, but as he was a native of Suffolk this seems doubtful, if the identification of Abdiah Cole as a Yorkshireman is correct. To complicate matters further several of the title pages also carry the name or initials of William Rowland who, in his translation of Johann Schr&ouml;der's <span class="italic">The Compleat Chymical Dispensatory</span> (1669), claimed to have translated all the authors ascribed jointly to Culpeper and Cole. The works formed part of a series entitled <span class="roman">The Rationall Physitian's Library</span> or <span class="roman">The Physitian's Library</span>, which eventually extended to some thirty titles, though Cole was not involved in all of them. The authors in whose work he had&#151;or was alleged to have had&#151;a hand were Thomas Bartholin, Jean Fernel, Jan Jonston, Felix Platter, Lazare Rivi&egrave;re, Martin Ruland, and Daniel Sennert. The only translation in which his name appears unaccompanied is Santorio Santorio's <span class="italic">A New Art of Physick</span> (1663). A portrait showing Cole in advanced age and with a furred doctor's gown appears with portraits of Rivi&egrave;re, Culpeper, and Rowland on the frontispiece (engraved by Thomas Cross) to Rivi&egrave;re's <span class="italic">The Practice of Physick</span> (1655).<br>
