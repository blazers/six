<span class="headword">Wilde, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1611&#150;1679), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the son and heir of William Wilde (<i>d</i>. 1650), a vintner of Bread Street, London. Admitted to the Inner Temple from Clifford's Inn on 13 February 1630, Wilde married, on 6 July that year, Hannah Terry, the daughter of another London vintner; their relationship was ended prematurely by Hannah's death two months later. Called to the bar on 21 May 1637, Wilde may have been practising in chancery and king's bench the following year, although his professional career was soon disrupted by political crisis and civil war. In summer 1643 William Wilde junior of the Temple was assessed at a mere &pound;50 by the parliamentarian committee for advance of money. Two years later he claimed that his net worth was only &pound;500, disregarding lands held by his father for life, and that over the previous eighteen months he had made less than &pound;15 as exigenter of Yorkshire, an office connected with the court of common pleas which Wilde may have held since 1631.<br>
<br>Despite the obscurity of the next few years of Wilde's life, his acquisition of an additional chamber in Figtree Court in 1649, election to the bench of the Inner Temple in November 1652, and second marriage that same year or earlier to Jane Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1661) of Hanwell, Middlesex, who would bear his son and heir, Felix, all point to a steadily expanding practice. With the revival of royalist City presbyterianism following the military coup which overthrew Richard Cromwell's protectorate, Wilde was elected on 3 November 1659 to the politically sensitive post of recorder of London. His personal standing and influence were further enhanced early next year when he was returned unopposed as one of the members for London in the Convention Parliament, where he busied himself with committee work and delivered at least eight speeches. As a member of the committee appointed to prepare parliament's response to the royal declaration of Breda, Wilde also joined the MPs who waited on Charles II in the Netherlands, and was knighted there together with London's other representatives after presenting a loyal address which he had helped to draft.<br>
<br>After his return to England, Wilde continued to play a linking role between parliament and the City. As recorder he served on the commission for the trial of the regicides, after moving successfully in the Commons that Sir Arthur Hesilrige not be indicted, and was raised to a baronetcy during the September adjournment. Created serjeant-at-law in October (when the patrons of his count were the earl of Northumberland and the lord mayor of London), Wilde was appointed king's serjeant on 10 November 1660. He also served in such local offices as justice of the peace and assessment commissioner, not only for London (where he became deputy lieutenant in 1662), but also for Middlesex and Kent. These reflected his extensive landed property, both leased and freehold, at Ash, Dunmow, and Lewisham, where he lived when not occupying his town houses at Great St Bartholomew's Close and Lincoln's Inn Fields, or his chambers at the Temple and Serjeants' Inn. However, Wilde did not stand for the Cavalier Parliament, perhaps because his failure to oppose the excise had damaged his political standing in London.<br>
<br>Following the death of his second wife in August 1661, Wilde married for a third time in October 1662. His bride was a 32-year-old spinster, Frances Barcroft (<i>d</i>. 1719), of St Michael Bassishaw, London. Their only son, William, was confusingly given the same baptismal name as both his father and his older half-brother, Wilde's second son by Dame Jane, the first Lady Wilde  (BL, Add. MS 5520, fol. 251). In April 1668 Wilde was made a puisne justice of common pleas; his appointment &#145;during pleasure&#146; signalled a major policy shift, since from 1641 onwards virtually all judges had been appointed &#145;during good behaviour&#146;. The significance of this change became apparent six years after his transfer to the court of king's bench in 1673, when Charles II revoked the patents of Wilde and three other judges. According to Burnet the dismissal of this &#145;worthy and ancient judge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.199) in April 1679 followed Wilde's judicial censure of perjured testimony by a key witness to the supposed Popish Plot.<br>
<br>Wilde died on 23 November 1679 and was buried on 2 December in the Temple Church (despite an expressed wish for his &#145;fraile body&#146; to lie in St Bartholomew's &#145;neere my deceased vertuous wife Dame Jane&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/361, fol. 333). His large estate of lands and leases, loans and mortgages, plate, fine furniture, jewellery, books, and musical instruments comprised the accumulated fruits of parental inheritance, marriage settlements, and a successful legal career. Wilde had been friendly with the learned physician Sir George Ent and was known to Sir John Evelyn. His only significant publication was as editor of Sir Henry Yelverton's king's bench reports (1661, and four subsequent editions).<br>
