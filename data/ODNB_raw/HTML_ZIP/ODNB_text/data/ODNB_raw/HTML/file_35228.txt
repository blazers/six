<span class="headword">Nicholson,  George</span>  (1847&#150;1908), <span class="occ">gardener and botanist</span>, was born at Ripon, Yorkshire, on 7 December 1847, the son of James Nicholson, gardener, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burr. Initially trained under his father, he then worked for some time in the gardens of Messrs Fisher and Holmes at Sheffield, before spending two years at the municipal nurseries of La Muette, Paris. On his return to England he worked at the nurseries of Messrs Low at Clapton. In 1873 he was appointed clerk to John Smith, the curator at Kew; in 1886 he succeeded Smith as curator. In 1875 he married Elizabeth Naylor Bell; she died soon after, leaving him a son who become an engineer in the Royal Navy. Nicholson retired owing to ill health in July 1901, but continued his botanical researches at Kew as far as his strength allowed.<br>
<br>A fluent speaker in French and German, Nicholson paid holiday visits to France and Switzerland, and travelled in Germany, northern Italy, and Spain. He was impressed with the value of a knowledge of foreign languages to young gardeners, and devoted much of his leisure to teaching some of them French. In 1893 he went to the Chicago Exhibition as one of the judges in the horticultural section; there he took the opportunity to study the forest trees of the United States. In 1902, the year after his retirement, he visited New York as delegate of the Royal Horticultural Society to the plant-breeding conference.<br>
<br>Until 1886 Nicholson devoted much attention to the critical study of British flowering plants. His first published work, &#145;Wild flora of Kew gardens and pleasure grounds&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany, British and Foreign</span>, for 1875. In the same year he joined the Botanical Exchange Club, and to its reports and to the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span> he contributed notes on such segregates as those of <i>Rosa</i> and of <i>Cardamine pratensis</i>. The &#145;Wild fauna and flora of Kew Gardens&#146;, issued in the <span class="italic">Kew Bulletin</span>  (additional ser. 5) in 1906 was largely his work. Out of 2000 fungi enumerated, 500 were found by Nicholson. His herbarium of British plants was presented, towards the end of his life, to the University of Aberdeen, through his friend James Trail, professor of botany there.<br>
<br>When Sir Joseph Hooker was reorganizing and extending the arboretum at Kew he found an able assistant in Nicholson, who wrote on the genera <i>Acer</i> and <i>Quercus</i> and twenty articles on the Kew arboretum in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, during 1881&#150;3. A valuable herbarium which he formed of trees and shrubs was purchased by the Bentham Trust in 1889 and presented to Kew. His <span class="italic">Hand-List of Trees and Shrubs Grown at Kew</span> (1894&#150;6) demonstrated his knowledge of this class of plants. Nicholson's <i>magnum opus</i> was <span class="italic">The Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening</span> (4 vols., 1884&#150;7; French edn, 1892&#150;9; two supp. vols., 1900&#150;01). This standard work of reference, most of which was not only edited but also written by Nicholson, became the forerunner of the Royal Horticultural Society's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Gardening</span>. Although an expert on oaks and maples he never realized his ambition to write a standard work on hardy trees and shrubs.<br>
<br>Nicholson's gentle, unselfish character, together with his reputation as a horticulturist, made him the obvious choice for first president of the Kew Guild, which was founded in 1893. He was elected an associate of the Linnean Society in 1886, became a fellow in 1898, and was awarded the Veitch memorial medal of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1894, and the Victoria medal of honour in 1897. In 1901 Udo Dammer named a Central American palm <i>Neonicholsonia georgei</i> and C. E. Salmon named a moss, found on a tree-fern at Kew, <i>Fissideus nicholsoni</i>. An athletic man, and a keen mountaineer, Nicholson died of heart trouble at his home, 37 Larkfield Road, Richmond, on 20 September 1908. His remains were cremated. The Royal Horticultural Society founded the Nicholson prize, awarded to students sitting the Wisley diploma examination, in his honour.<br>
