<span class="headword">Phillips,  Samuel</span>  (1814&#150;1854), <span class="occ">journalist and novelist</span>, born in London on 28 December 1814, was of Jewish origin, and was the third son of Philip Phillips, a tradesman (at first in St James's Street and afterwards in Regent Street, London) who dealt principally in lamps and chandeliers. At an early age Samuel showed such talent for mimicry and recitation that his parents were disposed to train him for the stage. He attracted the attention of the duke of Sussex by an essay on Milton and by his recitation of Collins's &#145;Ode to the Passions&#146;, a performance repeated by him at the Haymarket Theatre. On 23 June 1829 the fourteen-year-old Phillips appeared in an act of <span class="italic">Richard III</span> at the Covent Garden Theatre. He then had to turn his attention to his studies, first at the University of London and then at the University of G&ouml;ttingen in Germany, where he remained for more than a year. On 12 September 1836 he entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, intending to take orders in the Church of England. After one term, however, he was obliged, through the death of his father in financial difficulties, to leave the university, and in conjunction with his brother attempted to carry on his father's business. When they failed in their enterprise Phillips was forced in 1841 to take to his pen for subsistence. He was already married, to Rebecca Lyons (14 August 1839), and was moreover suffering from consumption, but he worked on with indomitable courage, though with little success.<br>
<br>While living in desperate straits at Ventnor in the Isle of Wight Phillips began a novel, <span class="italic">Caleb Stukely</span>, and sent the first part to the publishing firm of Blackwood at Edinburgh, who accepted it. Phillips then went to London to complete the work, and obtained temporary employment as private secretary and private tutor to Lord Francis Bruce. <span class="italic">Caleb Stukely</span> was finally published in 1844. In 1843 Phillips's first wife died and he married again in 1845. In the same year, through the interest of Lord Stanley, he was engaged by the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, and wrote two leaders a week for it for two years, chiefly on the subject of protection. About 1845 he obtained an appointment on the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a writer of literary reviews, and this post he filled for the rest of his life. He was also appointed secretary to an association formed in 1845, under the patronage of the duke of Richmond, for the support of farmers who had been injured through fiscal changes.<br>
<br>With the aid of Alderman Salomons Phillips soon afterwards purchased the <span class="italic">John Bull</span> newspaper, and for little more than a year he was both editor and proprietor. But the speculation was not very prosperous, and the labour overtaxed his strength. He parted with the paper in 1846. From 1843 to 1846 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> besides working for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He was a severe reviewer; Thackeray maintained that his review of <span class="italic">Henry Esmond</span> (1852) &#145;absolutely stopped&#146; sales of the novel  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 2.488). Phillips was as conservative in his literary tastes as in his politics. He disliked the pre-Raphaelites, and it was said of him that he could see nothing in <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> but a violation of the rights of property. A selection of his pieces, <span class="italic">Essays from &#145;The Times&#146;</span>, was published in 1851 as the first volume in Murray's series <span class="roman">Reading for the Rail</span>. <span class="italic">A Second Series of Essays from &#145;The Times&#146;</span> followed in 1854. Both these volumes were published anonymously, but were republished by Murray in 1871 under Phillips's name. One of Phillips's most popular contributions to <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, &#145;The banking house&#146;, was also republished in Philadelphia in 1855. In 1852 Phillips was honoured by the University of G&ouml;ttingen with the degree of LLD.<br>
<br>On the establishment of the Crystal Palace in 1853 Phillips was appointed its literary director, and for a time he was the company's treasurer. He wrote a <span class="italic">Guide to the Crystal Palace and Park</span> and <span class="italic">Portrait Gallery of the Crystal Palace</span> (1854). In August 1853 he suggested the formation of a society for promoting Assyrian archaeological exploration, and in a short time a staff of skilled operators was dispatched to Nineveh. From the commencement of his connection with the Crystal Palace Phillips resided at Sydenham Hill, London, but he also bought a house in Cleveland Gardens, Hyde Park, for future residence. While his new home was being prepared Phillips went to Brighton for his health, but died there very suddenly on 14 October 1854. He was buried in Sydenham church on 21 October 1854. His widow and five children survived him and were left very well provided for.<br>
