<span class="headword">Legge <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Finch]</span>,  Augusta</span>, countess of Dartmouth  (1822&#150;1900), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 18 February 1822, eldest of the two sons and two daughters of Heneage Finch, fifth earl of Aylesford (1786&#150;1859), and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lady Augusta Greville (<i>d</i>. 1845). She grew up at the family home at Packington in Warwickshire, and was educated by a governess of strong religious principles. She early became a devoted churchwoman, to the consternation of her family: &#145;I was not confirmed till I was nineteen&#146;, she later recalled, &#145;and my mother very much wished me to go to a ball the night before, and I was thought strange for not going&#146;  (How, 204). On 9 June 1846 at St James's, Westminster, she married a childhood friend, William Walter Legge, Viscount Lewisham (1823&#150;1891), who in 1853 succeeded his father as fifth earl of Dartmouth. It was a happy marriage, although one of her daughters was to comment that &#145;When I first remember her she was always ill. She had a very large family though only five of us [two sons and three daughters] grew up&#146;  (How, 212).<br>
<br>The family lived at Sandwell, near Birmingham, until 1853, when they took over the main Dartmouth family residence, Patshull Hall, near Wolverhampton. Unwilling to see Sandwell let to tenants, Lady Dartmouth persuaded her husband to use the house for a charitable purpose of benefit to the people of the Black Country. After a false start as a school for training girls for domestic service, the institution eventually settled down as a school for girls &#145;who, more or less gently born, were in needy circumstances&#146;  (How, 209). The first head of the school was Laetitia Frances Selwyn, sister of the bishop of Lichfield, and it remained open until the death of Lord Dartmouth in 1891. Lady Dartmouth was also active at a local level in the Girls' Friendly Society, in the Ladies' Home Mission Association, the Mothers' Union, and the Church of England Waifs and Strays Society. She also formed clothing clubs and lending libraries for her tenants and poor neighbours, and supplied the largest of the local villages with the services of a parish nurse.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1891, Lady Dartmouth retired to Woodsome Hall, another of the family houses, near Huddersfield. She had previously spent time in the area, and was known to the local independent loom-workers, whom she had assisted by selling their linsey when they were under great pressure of competition from factories. Now based in the newly formed diocese of Wakefield, she was instrumental in the formation of the Mothers' Union there, of which she served as diocesan president. Moreover, in 1892 she established the All Saints' Home for orphaned baby boys, under the auspices of the Church of England Waifs and Strays Society, in the neighbouring parish of Almondbury. She supervised this home personally, keeping the accounts and managing its affairs; she had a highly regarded capacity for business, and a motherly relationship with the boys.<br>
<br>Brought up in the country, Lady Dartmouth was an active agriculturalist. She took charge of the poultry yards at Patshull, and originated (by cross-breeding) the Andalusian bantam. She was particularly proud of the fact that she supplied all the birds for her elder son's twenty-first birthday celebrations. Until late in life she was to be found walking her grounds accompanied by her terriers, occasionally indulging in a surreptitious rat hunt. Lady Dartmouth died from a fall at Woodsome Hall on 1 December 1900, and was buried three days later at Patshull.<br>
