<span class="headword">Day <span class="st"> [Daye]</span>,  Stephen</span>  (1593/4&#150;1668), <span class="occ">locksmith and first printer in the British American colonies</span>, was born in England, probably at Cambridge, and married Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright (<i>bap</i>. 1588, <i>d</i>. 1658), widow of Andrew Bordman, on 24 February 1617 at St Mary-the-Less, Cambridge. He was working as a locksmith in Cambridge on 7 June 1638, when he bound himself and his family to take passage to New England on the <i>John</i> of London. The Revd Joseph Glover, who had resigned his cure at Sutton, Surrey, in 1636 rather than read King James's <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, advanced &pound;51 toward passage and supplies for Day, his wife, their two sons, his stepson William Bordman, and three menservants; Day in return engaged for himself and the servants to work for Glover for two years after their arrival &#145;in the trade wch the said Stephen &hellip; now useth &hellip; at such rates &hellip; as is usually paid &hellip; in the Country there&#146; until the debt of &pound;51 plus interest was worked off  (Harvard University archives, Dunster MSS). Glover took along a small press worth &pound;20, fonts of English, Greek, and unpointed Hebrew, and 120 reams of paper, but he died on the way over and the press, together with the services of Day and his workmen, passed to his widow. On 21 June 1641 she married Henry Dunster, president of Harvard College, who controlled the press until 1654, when he resigned from the presidency and sold it to the college.<br>
<br>The <i>John</i> arrived in Boston about October 1638 and the press began to operate at Cambridge in 1639, evidently under Day's direction, for the general court granted him 300 acres of land on 10 December 1641 as &#145;the first that sett upon printing&#146;  (N. B. Shurtleff, ed., <span class="italic">Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England</span>, 5 vols., 1853&#150;4, 1.344). Until 1667 the product was solely dedicated to the church, state, and college, beginning with the freeman's oath of allegiance to the colony (no copy extant) and 1700 copies of the <span class="italic">Bay Psalm Book</span> (1640), a metrical version by the ministers of Boston and its vicinity. Apart from annual series of Harvard commencement programs (1642&#150;) and possibly of almanacs (1640?&#150;; surviving from 1646) the press produced nothing between 1643 and late 1645, when Governor Winthrop's <span class="italic">Declaration</span> of his dealings with the Narragansetts appeared, printed in a new pica type probably acquired by Dunster.<br>
<br>Day mortgaged much of his Cambridge property in 1642 and, during the lull in printing, launched upon more congenial but less celebrated enterprises, establishing an ironworks and an Indian trading post with others at Nashaway, and prospecting for graphite and bog iron on behalf of John Winthrop jun. at Tantiusques and Chapnacongoe Pond, all in western Massachusetts. He resented his employment at the press, which had not been envisaged in his bond, and, perhaps because he could have earned more as a locksmith, he later claimed that Dunster owed him &pound;100. Day's eldest son, Stephen, died in 1639 and Matthew (the only Day named in a surviving imprint) probably took over the direction of the press in his father's absence; at Matthew's death, on 10 May 1649, Samuel Green succeeded him as colony printer, leasing the press from Dunster or from Harvard. Day was a shaky speller and neither he, Matthew, nor Green had any regular apprenticeship in printing, but the scanty production of the press required no great competence.<br>
<br>According to Governor Winthrop the Nashaway entrepreneurs were &#145;most of them poor men, and some of them corrupt in judgment, and others profane&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of John Winthrop</span>, 504). Despite &#145;entertaining both English &amp; Indians at my own house [in Lancaster], from day to day for some yeares together&#146;  (Massachusetts Archives, Columbia Point, Boston, 30.135) Day never settled there and forfeited his rights as one of the original company after the plantation was incorporated in 1652. His wife died on 17 October 1658 but there is no evidence that he ever remarried, despite Littlefield's circumstantial assertion  (Littlefield, 1.125). He joined the church of Cambridge (where he sat below Samuel Green) on 28 February 1661, and on 22 December 1668 he died, leaving his stepson William, a tailor, about &pound;75 of personal estate, which included his smithy, and land in Cambridge, Lancaster, and Shawshine. A wooden press in the Vermont Historical Society, once hopefully identified as &#145;the Stephen Daye Press&#146;, cannot be dated earlier than 1714.<br>
