<span class="headword">Aveling,  Edward Bibbens</span>  (1849&#150;1898), <span class="occ">Marxist campaigner</span>, was born on 29 November 1849 at 6 Nelson Terrace, Stoke Newington, the fifth of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/921/', "Thomas William Baxter Aveling (1815&#150;1884)")</script>, Congregationalist minister, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1877), daughter of Thomas Goodall, farmer and innkeeper, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. In 1863 he was sent with his brother Frederick to the West of England Dissenters' Proprietary School in Taunton, of which Frederick later became headmaster. He left after two years and received private tuition before enrolling in 1867 as a medical student at University College, London, where &#145;he gathered medals and awards like a child plucking flowers&#146;  (Tsuzuki, 77). He transferred to the science faculty when he was twenty and gained a BSc degree in 1870. After briefly working in Cambridge as an assistant to the physiologist Michael Foster, he returned to London in 1872. On 30 July of that year, in a ceremony at which his father officiated, he married Isabel Campbell Frank (1848/9&#150;1892), daughter of John Frank, a prosperous poulterer who had died in 1868 leaving an estate of &pound;25,000 of which Bell, as she was generally known, was a coheir. After two years the couple separated by mutual agreement. They never divorced and the marriage ended only with her death in 1892. Aveling claimed that she was unable to live with his atheism. Friedrich Engels understood her to have run off with a clergyman. The view that he had married her for money and left her when he had got all he could from her became widespread.<br>
<br>From 1872 to 1876 Aveling was a teacher of elementary physics and botany at the North London Collegiate School for Girls, Camden Road. In 1876 he took his DSc and was made a fellow of the Linnean Society. Also in 1876 he became lecturer in comparative anatomy at the London Hospital, and began teaching science at King's College, London. In 1878 he was awarded a fellowship at University College. His failed marriage aside, he was on a climbing path of conventional success and acclaim, which he left in 1879 when he abandoned his application for the chair of comparative anatomy because the post required its holder to profess Christianity. In July 1879 he made a public pronouncement that he had been an atheist for two or three years. In June 1881 he lost his lectureship, largely because of his atheism.<br>
<br>From early 1879 Aveling had been an anonymous contributor to the <span class="italic">National Reformer</span>, published by the National Secular Society (NSS), and been a friend (probably also a lover) of Annie Besant, one of the society's leaders. He now lectured, wrote, and taught extensively for the organization. The educational programmes at its hall of science in Old Street, London, were largely run by him. These were very successful, and Aveling was clearly a talented teacher. He made a living as a coach and published several textbooks, on biology, chemistry, botany, physiology, and physics. His atheism was informed by his reading of Darwin and he published several articles and pamphlets on Darwinism as well as a book, <span class="italic">The Student's Darwin</span> (1881). In 1880 he was elected a vice-president of the NSS, a position which he held until 1884. In November 1882 he stood successfully for election to the London school board. His candidacy brought him into contact with H. M. Hyndman's Democratic Federation (later the Social Democratic Federation). It was probably around this time that his conversion to Marxism began, though he did not declare his new allegiance until April 1884.<br>
<br>For a while Aveling managed to combine membership of the NSS with his socialist beliefs: during his editorship of the secularist G. W. Foote's periodical <span class="italic">Progress</span> in 1883&#150;4 he made it a socialist paper, for example, and in May 1884 he lectured on socialism in the hall of science. But although there were at this time many socialists in the NSS, it was essentially a movement for civil and religious liberty. Its leader, Charles Bradlaugh, was hostile to socialism. In 1884 Aveling announced that he was to begin living with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40945/', "Eleanor Marx (1855&#150;1898)")</script>, daughter of Karl Marx. This liaison produced extraordinary vitriol from Annie Besant and triggered Bradlaugh's decision to force Aveling out of the NSS in July 1884. It is likely that Bradlaugh was also influenced by financial misconduct on Aveling's part, but Aveling resigned from the NSS before his financial dealings could be fully investigated.<br>
<br>Aveling and Eleanor Marx Aveling (as she became known) were elected to the executive council of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in 1884, but in December they were among those who left the SDF and founded the rival Socialist League under William Morris in protest against Hyndman's attempts to dominate the organization and his support for participation by the SDF in parliamentary elections. Hyndman, like many others, disliked Aveling intensely. Notorious both for the debts which he habitually incurred and for his numerous affairs with women, Aveling was widely regarded as being without scruples in his private life. The many accounts of his repulsive physical appearance are not borne out by surviving photographs and seem to be informed more by the &#145;moral dread&#146; which he occasioned in some people than by his unremarkable features. William Morris's daughter called him a &#145;little lizard of a man&#146;  (Kapp, 264&#150;5) and Olive Schreiner said that he looked like an illicit diamond buyer. According to Hyndman, &#145;nobody can be as bad as Aveling looks&#146;  (ibid.). Though he was plainly a hedonistic and untrustworthy man, his reputation for wickedness owes much to the factious and polemical world in which he worked, with its organized campaigns of personal abuse. Hyndman's hostility arose partly from Aveling's membership of the &#145;Marx clique&#146;. His relationship with Eleanor brought Engels's steadfast patronage. In the spring of 1884, for example, Engels brought Aveling in to assist Samuel Moore in the English translation of <span class="italic">Das Kapital</span>, despite his having only a very basic knowledge of political economy. Aveling also translated Engels's <span class="italic">Socialism, Utopian and Scientific</span>. Engels trusted Aveling in the role of popularizer of orthodox Marxism and in this respect if in no other Aveling deserved trust. He was a highly effective orator, and an uncreative thinker whose publications on Marxism (for example, <span class="italic">The Student's Marx</span>, 1892) were largely expository.<br>
<br>The Socialist League was soon divided between anarchists and socialists, and the Avelings left its executive council in August 1885. On 1 May 1886 Aveling resigned as editor of its journal, <span class="italic">The Commonweal</span>, and on 31 August 1886 he and Eleanor sailed for America, where Aveling had been invited to make a speaking tour by the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) of North America. They travelled very extensively there and were generally well received, but Aveling's extravagant expenses claims caused a huge argument with the SLP, which was gleefully covered by the mainstream press in Britain and America and which continued to rumble in the socialist press until August 1887.<br>
<br>After his return to Britain, Aveling took part in the new unionism of unskilled workers. In 1889 he helped Will Thorne draw up the rules of the Gas Workers' Union. He was active in the movement for an eight-hour working day, and in campaigns for free speech. An overarching objective was the weaning of radical workmen from the Liberal Party to prepare the ground for the formation of a workers' party. In January 1893 he attended the opening conference of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), as a delegate of the Bloomsbury socialists and the Legal Eight Hours and International Labour League. He was elected to its executive and to the committee of six charged with drafting the party's programme. But his personal unpopularity caused his influence in the party to wane and he was expelled from the ILP London district council in May 1894. He continued to be active in the legal eight-hour movement and in the Second International, and he resumed involvement with the SDF.<br>
<br>Alongside his political career, Aveling, like Eleanor Marx, was involved in the theatre. From April 1885, as Alec Nelson, he had been a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Dramatic Review</span>. Three plays written by him under the same pseudonym were performed at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London in 1889, and a fourth was produced in 1890. He was involved with Eleanor in introducing English audiences to Ibsen's work. In 1892 he produced an operetta. In 1896 he produced and acted in his comedietta <span class="italic">The Landlady</span>. On 8 June 1897 he secretly married an actress in this production, Eva Frye (<i>b</i>. 1874/5), using the name Alec Nelson. He left Eleanor in August but returned to her in September, probably because of a lack of money and his increasingly poor health. Since about 1894 he had been suffering from an abscess on his side, which was the result of kidney disease. He remained seriously ill and dependent on Eleanor Marx's very attentive nursing. In February 1898 he underwent surgery. On 31 March 1898 Eleanor committed suicide. Aveling's infidelity and the financial straits which his extravagance and then his illness had brought on her were undoubtedly factors in her death. There was widespread speculation that he had somehow participated in killing her. He outlived her by only four months, dying&#151;from complications arising from his operation&#151;on 2 August 1898 at his home, 2 Stafford Mansions, Albert Bridge Road, Battersea, the home he had established with his new wife after Eleanor's death. He was cremated in Woking, Surrey, on 5 August. Despite his numerous relationships with women, he is not known to have had any children.<br>
