<span class="headword">Beckett,  John William</span>  (1894&#150;1964), <span class="occ">political activist and journalist</span>, was born at 165 King Street, Hammersmith, London, on 11 October 1894, the only son of William Beckett, master draper, and Eva Dorothy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Salmon). He was educated at the local elementary school and Latymer Upper School, but left at fourteen to become a shop assistant. Later he became a part-time student at the polytechnic, and studied journalism and advertising by correspondence course. At the outbreak of the First World War he immediately volunteered for the army. He was wounded and discharged in March 1917 as unfit for further service. On 2 April 1918 he married Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shaw (<i>b</i>. 1892), daughter of a commercial traveller.<br>
<br>Beckett's experiences as a &#145;temporary soldier&#146;  (<span class="italic">WW</span>) wrought a profound change in his thinking. In Sheffield, where he was seeking work, he was converted to socialism, joining the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in September 1917. When his employers dismissed him for publicly advocating socialism, he returned to the south of England, settled in Hackney, and joined the local branch of the ILP. He became co-founder and chairman of the National Union of ex-Servicemen. The union was soon dissolved for, unlike similar associations, it refused to amalgamate into the British Legion.<br>
<br>Beckett swiftly established a reputation as an effective public speaker. Elected to Hackney council, his angry words once again caused offence to his employers and he was dismissed. Unabashed he pursued his political activities with even greater purpose. In 1920 he was elected to the divisional council of the ILP. Later that same year he was appointed Clement Attlee's full-time political agent. Next, he became secretary both to the ILP's divisional council and the No More War Movement. At Clifford Allen's invitation Beckett, with other enthusiasts, helped to draft the ILP programme for the 1922 national conference. When Attlee entered parliament in 1922, Beckett became his private secretary. In 1923 came Beckett's own first, unsuccessful, attempt to enter parliament, for North Newcastle, but the following year he was adopted for Gateshead and was returned in a three-cornered contest with a majority of more than 9000. In 1929, for personal as much as for political reasons, Beckett abandoned Gateshead for Peckham, serving as their ILP MP until 1931.<br>
<br>Though comparatively short, Beckett's parliamentary career was packed with tumult and incident. He was twice suspended from the Commons: in 1929 for calling the prime minister a liar, and in 1930 for seizing and making off with the mace. He had little respect for the traditions of parliament, believing them to be outdated. His relations with most of his colleagues were not easy. Many thought him vulgar and untrustworthy. He was certainly indiscreet, both in his extramarital relations and in his eagerness to tackle issues that others as eagerly avoided. His impatient, passionate, incautious nature was offended by what he supposed was the Labour Party's reluctance to implement its supporters' wishes. His disillusion was compounded by the death of the left-wing Labour MP John Wheatley in 1930, and made complete when MacDonald's government introduced the <span class="roman">Unemployment Insurance Anomalies Bill</span>. This measure, Beckett openly avowed, discriminated unfairly against the most vulnerable groups of workers. In the subsequent general election he stood against the official Labour candidate to no avail: the National Government candidate was elected.<br>
<br>Beckett's first marriage ended in divorce in 1929. The following year, on 5 July, he married Violet Kyrle (1892/3&#150;1948), daughter of Louis Hance Falck, solicitor, and widow of Arthur Bourchier, actor and theatre manager. She was herself better known as the actress Kyrle Bellew. From 1921 to 1923 Beckett successfully edited a monthly magazine he had founded, the <span class="italic">East London Pioneer</span>. When his other duties allowed, he contributed occasional articles to the small Labour press. His journalistic skills enjoyed more scope when, like some other disillusioned Labour supporters, he joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96364', "British Union of Fascists")</script> in March 1934. This inversion of political loyalties followed an unsuccessful period as business manager of his wife's theatre, the Strand, which ended in bankruptcy. Oswald Mosley's New Party provided Beckett with unrivalled opportunities to indulge his pugnacity in street-corner confrontations. His histrionic skills made him a rousing public orator, and he was appointed the New Party's director of publicity. For all his anti-Jewish ranting, Beckett was never a doctrinaire antisemite: Jews were a convenient focus for his anger and aggression. He edited <span class="italic">Fascist Weekly</span>, supposedly the more highbrow of the party's two weekly papers. It was renamed <span class="italic">Action</span> in 1936, the reincarnation of the equally pitiful little paper that Harold Nicolson had edited until its closure in 1931. Beckett's diatribes attracted a series of sensational lawsuits. In March 1937 Mosley told his senior staff there was insufficient money to continue paying them. Beckett, together with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37621/', "William Joyce")</script>, did not wait for their dismissal, but left to form the National Socialist League. This hopelessly ineffectual organization at least afforded Joyce and Beckett a platform from which to censure Mosley, the leader to whom they had previously shown sycophantic loyalty.<br>
<br>Beckett admired Joyce, but in 1939 they parted, for Beckett, the old soldier, could not bring himself to support Hitler. Beckett acquired new, more aristocratic political associates in Viscount Lymington and the duke of Bedford. They formed the British People's Party (BPP), another hopelessly impotent political grouping that espoused a bizarre hotchpotch of contradictory ideas on pacifism, fascism, and social credit. At the outbreak of war, they renamed themselves the British Council for Settlement in Europe. In May 1940 Beckett, then secretary of the BPP and an enthusiastic member of the Local Defence Volunteers, was arrested under regulation 18B of the <span class="roman">Emergency Powers (Defence) Act</span> of 1939, which allowed the government to imprison without trial and without term anyone thought to endanger national security. This was because of his former association with Mosley. Though his imprisonment was clearly politically motivated, his <i>ex parte</i> application for a writ of habeas corpus failed, and Beckett was one of the last of those imprisoned under the regulation to be released in October 1943. It was a neat, though cruel, irony that the man responsible for Beckett's tardy release was home secretary Herbert Morrison: in the early 1920s, when Morrison was appointed mayor of Hackney, Beckett had accused him of political jobbery.<br>
<br>Ill, and under a restrictive order, Beckett re-established contact with the BPP. In the public's mind, whatever was claimed to the contrary, the BPP was tarred with antisemitism and pro-Nazi sentiments. BPP meetings invariably prompted public protest. When the duke of Bedford, who had been effectively Beckett's patron since his release from prison, died in 1953, Beckett's career as a political activist was ended. In the years that remained, he supported himself and his family (he had two sons and two daughters) by publishing a fortnightly stock market tip sheet, <span class="italic">Advice and Information</span>. An interest in Roman Catholicism prompted by his painful experiences in both world wars culminated in Beckett's reception into that church in 1952. He died at his home in London, 187 Queen's Gate, on 28 December 1964, leaving a third wife as his widow.<br>
