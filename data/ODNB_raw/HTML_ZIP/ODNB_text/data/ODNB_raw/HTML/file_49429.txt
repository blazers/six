<span class="headword">Leuthere</span>  (<em>d.</em> 675/6), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was a Frank who was the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39117/', "Agilbert (d. 679x90)")</script>, sometime bishop of the West Saxons and later bishop of Paris. Leuthere originated from the Soissons area in Francia, and since his name is a form of Clothar, a name borne by three Frankish kings, it is likely that he was related to the Merovingian royal family. His name is also basically the same as that of the contemporary king of Kent, Hlothhere (<i>d</i>. 685), which suggests that Leuthere had family links with the Kentish royal house. Here one is reminded that his uncle, Agilbert, likewise had the Frankish form of a Kentish royal name, &AElig;thelberht.<br>
<br>According to Bede  (<span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span> 3.7), in 670 Cenwalh, king of the West Saxons, wished to recall Agilbert to become once more a bishop in his kingdom, but Agilbert declined the offer because he was now bishop of Paris. In his stead he sent his nephew Leuthere, who was already a priest. Leuthere was consecrated bishop by Theodore of Canterbury in 670 and he held the see of Winchester from 670 to 675 or 676. As bishop he attended the Council of Hertford in 672. In 675 he appeared in a charter granting land at Malmesbury for the foundation of a monastery there. The beneficiary of this grant was Aldhelm, later bishop of Sherborne, whom Leuthere may have ordained priest. Leuthere's successor H&aelig;dde witnessed the Malmesbury charter as abbot, but later in the same year H&aelig;dde appears in another charter as bishop, alongside Leuthere. This may suggest that at least briefly Leuthere ruled Winchester jointly with his successor. In both charters the style of Leuthere's witness reveals use of a so-called Frankish &#145;humility formula&#146;, an observation which supports the argument that it was Frankish, rather than Italian, models which formed the basis of early charter writing in England. The second charter of 675 granted land at Bath for the foundation of a monastery. It is Leuthere's last appearance in the record and he died in that year or the next.<br>
<br>Interestingly, Bertha, the abbess of the new double monastery at Bath, bore the same name as &AElig;thelberht of Kent's Frankish queen, a name similar to that of Bertila who began her career at the double monastery of Jouarre with which Leuthere had strong family connections. The little that is known about Leuthere therefore strengthens the impression that there was a powerful Frankish influence upon the early development of the church in southern England, and that at the centre of that influence lay the family of Leuthere.<br>
