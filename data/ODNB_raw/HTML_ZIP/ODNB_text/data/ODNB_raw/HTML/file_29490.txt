<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Charles James Watkin</span>  (1828&#150;1884), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Llansannan on 23 September 1828, the eldest son of Peter Williams, rector of Llansannan, Denbighshire (afterwards of Llangar, Merioneth), and his wife, Lydia Sophia, the daughter of James Price of Plas-yn-Llysfaen, Denbighshire. After leaving Ruthin grammar school he studied medicine under J. E. Erichsen at University College Hospital, where he won the gold medal for comparative anatomy, and acted for a time as house surgeon. He became the lifelong friend of Sir Henry Thompson and Sir John Russell Reynolds. But he soon resolved to abandon medicine for law. He spent a few terms at St Mary Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 1 May 1851, but he did not enjoy it and never graduated. Also in 1851 he entered the Middle Temple, and read in the chambers of Horatio Lloyd, a well-known special pleader. When called to the bar three years later, he practised in the same branch of the profession, publishing <span class="italic">An Essay on the Philosophy of Evidence</span> (1855), which included discussion of clairvoyance, as well as a book on civil actions (1857), which established his reputation and brought him a large practice, and continued in use as the standard textbook for students at the inns of court until the passing of the <span class="roman">Judicature Acts</span> in the later nineteenth century. In 1859 Williams was named &#145;tubman&#146; of the court of exchequer. He worked first on the home circuit, and afterwards on the south-eastern. Known for clarity of statement rather than any rhetorical technique he none the less displayed a dry sense of humour in court. Williams was made a QC in 1873 and made a speciality of financial and mercantile cases. In <i>Thomas v. R.</i>, Williams vindicated the title of the subject to sue the crown for unliquidated damages resulting from breach of contract.<br>
<br>Williams was twice married: his first wife, Henrietta, the daughter of William Henry Carey and niece of Vice-Chancellor Malins, died in 1864; in the following year he married Elizabeth, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17208/', "Lord Justice Robert Lush")</script>.<br>
<br>Williams was Liberal MP for the Denbigh boroughs from November 1868 until 1880, when he was elected for Caernarvonshire. As early as 1854 he had published a pamphlet on the <span class="italic">Law of Church Rates</span>, and, though himself a churchman, he moved a resolution in the House of Commons on 24 May 1870 in favour of the disestablishment of the church in Wales. The motion was successfully opposed by Gladstone. In 1875 Williams served as a member of Sir Henry James's committee on foreign loans. When Gladstone returned to office in 1880, Williams was offered but declined the post of judge-advocate-general. In November of the same year, on the promotion of Sir Robert Lush to a lord-justiceship, Williams, his son-in-law, was appointed to the vacant puisne judgeship, though he had recently made a public declaration that he would never accept such an office. His judgment in the important case of privilege of counsel (<i>Munster v. Lamb</i>), when he nonsuited the plaintiff, was upheld by the superior courts. To the council of judges Williams submitted a paper advocating the abolition of distinctions between the Common Pleas and Exchequer divisions, but the retention of the chiefships. He publicly repudiated their decisions announced in November 1881, declaring that nothing less than an act of parliament should ever induce him to deprive a prisoner of the right of making a statement to a jury of facts not given in evidence. In <i>nisi prius</i> business his knowledge and quickness of apprehension were invaluable, but his judgments in complicated cases of law were sometimes diffuse and loosely reasoned.<br>
<br>In 1884 Williams was knighted. In July of the same year he came with Mr Justice Lopes to Nottingham assizes. Lopes took the unprecedented step of reading the royal proclamation against vice and immorality. On the night of 17 July 1884 Williams died at Nottingham of heart failure &#145;in disreputable circumstances&#146;. Despite being hushed up the incident became common knowledge in Nottingham and for years afterwards ribald &#145;mourning cards&#146; were circulated. The scandal was still spoken of as late as the 1940s. Williams was survived by his second wife and several children, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 22 July 1884.<br>
