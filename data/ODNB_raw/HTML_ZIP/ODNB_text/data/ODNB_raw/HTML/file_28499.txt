<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (1732&#150;1807), <span class="occ">elocutionist, orthoepist, and lexicographer</span>, was born on 18 March 1732 at Colney Heath, a hamlet in the parish of Friern Barnet, Middlesex, on the eastern side of Finchley Common. Nothing is known about his father, except that he died when John was a child. His mother came from Nottingham and was the sister of the Revd James Morley, a dissenting minister in Painswick, Gloucestershire. Walker attended grammar school, but left early to learn a trade, of which he tried several, but none suited him. On his mother's death, when he was about seventeen, he decided to pursue a career on the stage and joined a succession of provincial theatre companies, the last of which was in Gloucester. In 1757 he joined Garrick's company at Drury Lane, where he at first played minor characters, such as Angus in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, but was soon promoted to play the second parts in tragedy, and those of a grave and sententious nature in comedy.<br>
<br>In May 1758 Walker married Miss Sybilla Minors 
    (Myners; 1723&#150;1802)
  , a well-known comic actress at Drury Lane. Shortly after their marriage they were both engaged by Spranger Barry and Henry Woodward to join the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin, where Walker took on many of Henry Mossop's characters after Mossop joined the Smock Alley Theatre. While he was engaged in Dublin he also played summer seasons in Bristol. In June 1762 he returned to London, where he and his wife joined Beard's company at Covent Garden. His first appearance on this stage was on 25 October 1762 as Downright in <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span>, which was considered to be his best performance, though his Cato and Brutus were also commended. Walker left Covent Garden in 1767 and, after a year's stay in Dublin and a final summer season in Bristol, quit the stage in 1768. Although he achieved a certain level of fame as an actor, it was acknowledged that &#145;though a judicious and correct, he was far from a perfect actor. His gesture was ungraceful and &hellip; his enunciation monotonous&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 78).<br>
<br>In January 1769 Walker started a school at Kensington gravel pits with the Revd James Usher. Under Usher's influence he had converted to Roman Catholicism shortly after his marriage, and he continued to adhere to this faith for the rest of his life. Although the school was a success, Walker left after two years, following a disagreement with Usher, to become a teacher of elocution. He was very successful in this, attracting more pupils than he could accommodate, mainly young men aiming to qualify for the senate or the bar. By 1775 Walker's reputation was such that he was invited to give a series of lectures in Edinburgh. These were so popular that he was invited back, and he also gave the lectures in Dublin and in Oxford, where he was subsequently invited by the heads of several colleges to give private lectures in the university. Walker's pupils included the emperor of Russia's prime minister, the sons of Lord Erskine, and several members of parliament. As well as Garrick, his friends and patrons included Samuel Johnson, John Milner, the Roman Catholic bishop of Castabala, and Edmund Burke, who introduced him to an acquaintance as &#145;Mr Walker, whom not to know, by name at least, would argue want of knowledge of the harmonies, cadences, and proprieties of our language&#146;  (Emerson, 115).<br>
<br>Walker was the leader of the &#145;mechanical&#146; school of elocution, in which detailed rules concerning voice production, posture, and gesture were laid down, as opposed to the &#145;natural&#146; school led by Thomas Sheridan. Although Walker's first publication was <span class="italic">A General Idea of a Pronouncing Dictionary</span> (1774), and he also published <span class="italic">Exercises for Improvement in Elocution</span> (1777) and <span class="italic">Hints for Improvement in the Art of Reading</span> (1783), it was his <span class="italic">Elements of Elocution</span> (1781), <span class="italic">Rhetorical Grammar</span> (1785), and <span class="italic">The Melody of Speaking</span> (1787) which sealed his reputation as an elocutionist. His major contribution was his theory of inflections, whereby the pitch of the voice moves up or down, or both up and down, within a single syllable. These ideas were not original, having been put forward by Joshua Steele in <span class="italic">Prosodia rationalis</span> (1775), but Steele's work, with its elaborate musical notation, was much more difficult for the public to understand. It is unlikely that Walker actually plagiarized Steele because, by his own admission, he had a &#145;total want of knowledge in music&#146; and found himself incapable of understanding Steele's notation  (<span class="italic">Elements of Elocution</span>, 1781, xi&#150;xii).<br>
<br>Walker's ideas on elocution continued to be influential throughout the nineteenth century, but it is as an orthoepist and lexicographer that he is best known. His most important and frequently reprinted works are his <span class="italic">Rhyming Dictionary</span>, first published in 1775 but still in press throughout the twentieth century, and, above all, his <span class="italic">Critical Pronouncing Dictionary</span> (1791). This was the most successful and authoritative pronouncing dictionary of the late eighteenth and the nineteenth century. It was reprinted over 100 times up to 1904 and was the basis of over 20 other dictionaries published in the nineteenth century, including B. H. Smart's <span class="italic">Walker Remodelled</span> (1836). The <span class="italic">Critical Pronouncing Dictionary</span> was successful and influential in the United States as well as Britain, the first American edition appearing in 1803. The success of this work was due to its detailed and authoritative pronouncements on correct pronunciation, set out in 545 &#145;rules&#146; prefaced to the dictionary proper as well as in notes to any word whose pronunciation was controversial. Walker used the same system of notation as Sheridan, marking the different pronunciations of vowels with superscripted numbers, but criticized him for &#145;numerous instances &hellip; of impropriety, inconsistency, and want of acquaintance with the analogies of the Language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Pronouncing Dictionary</span>, 1791, 1). Walker was acknowledged to have &#145;settled all doubts on the subject&#146; of English pronunciation, and his <span class="italic">Critical Pronouncing Dictionary</span> came to be regarded as the &#145;statute book of English orthoepy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 81). By the end of the nineteenth century Walker had become a byword for linguistic correctness, so that those who used an affected pronunciation were accused of trying to &#145;out-Walker Walker&#146;  (Mugglestone, <span class="italic">Talking Proper</span>, 41). In the twentieth century his authority came to be superseded by that of Daniel Jones, and he has come to be regarded as an arch-prescriptivist. This criticism was first levelled at him by Alexander Ellis, who, while acknowledging his &#145;good and hard work&#146;, accused Walker of being one of &#145;these word-peddlars, those letter-drivers, those stiff-necked pedantic philosophical, miserably informed, and therefore supremely certain, self-confident and self-conceited orthographers&#146;  (<span class="italic">On Early English Pronunciation</span>, 1869, 2.629, 1.155).<br>
<br>After the <span class="italic">Critical Pronouncing Dictionary</span> Walker published <span class="italic">A Key to the Classical Pronunciation of Greek and Latin Proper Names</span> (1798), which, as &#145;Walker's key&#146;, was appended to several dictionaries in the nineteenth century, including an edition of Webster's American dictionary in 1829, Joseph Worcester's <span class="italic">Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language</span> (1846), and several later editions of the <span class="italic">Critical Pronouncing Dictionary</span>. His last works were <span class="italic">The Academic Speaker</span> (1801), <span class="italic">The Teacher's Assistant in English Composition</span> (1801), and <span class="italic">Outlines of English Grammar</span> (1805).<br>
<br>Walker died at Tottenham Court Road, London, on 1 August 1807, his wife having died in April 1802. He was buried at St Pancras on 7 August, and left about &pound;7000, most of which was bequeathed to distant relatives and the rest to friends. Although, as his authoritative pronouncements suggest, he was dogmatic and opinionated, and at times irritable and impatient, he was scrupulously honest, generous, and charitable, and a loyal friend even to those who disagreed with him.<br>
