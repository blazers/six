<span class="headword">Harrison,  John Vernon</span>  (1892&#150;1972), <span class="occ">geologist and explorer</span>, was born on 16 March 1892 at Bloemfontein, Orange Free State, the son of J. Frederick Harrison, a civil engineer. Of Scottish parentage, he was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and Allan Glen's School, Glasgow, before proceeding to Glasgow University where the inspiration provided by the great explorer professor John Walter Gregory was to set the pattern for Harrison's whole professional life.<br>
<br>Harrison graduated in 1914, and became an explosives chemist before being commissioned in the Royal Engineers, where he was concerned with water-supply problems in Mesopotamia. In late 1918 he was seconded to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, joining their staff on demobilization and remaining with the company for the next twenty years. During this period he undertook geological exploration in Central and South America, Borneo, and the West Indies, as well as the work in Persia for which he became best-known. Harrison's gifts of observation coupled with vivid geological imagination enabled him to visualize in three dimensions the large-scale geological structures with which he was confronted, particularly in the Zagros Mountains, and the sometimes singular processes which had given rise to them. Striking results emerged from arduous fieldwork carried out in the roughest of terrains; it is said that many mules died nobly in Harrison's service in Persia. Among some forty published papers, those with G. M. Lees on salt dome emplacement and with N. L. Falcon on gravitational tectonics long retained classic status.<br>
<br>In 1938 Harrison accepted a university demonstratorship in geology at Oxford where he undertook all the undergraduate teaching in structural geology and in petrology. The field classes he led, clad in a kilt of no recognized tartan, to Arran, Skye, and Assynt became legendary and he played a major role in the training of many geologists. His outstanding research record, as well as his qualities as a teacher, stressing rigour and accuracy, were recognized by his election to a readership <i>ad hominem</i> in 1956. Harrison's Oxford years saw no diminution in his urge to continue geological exploration in remote regions, and he surveyed thousands of square kilometres of the Peruvian Andes in a series of summer expeditions on which he was often accompanied by one or two of his students, who would return exhausted, but with vivid travellers' tales.<br>
<br>Harrison (universally known simply as &#145;J. V.&#146;), believing that any young geologist who married was placing fetters upon his activities to the extent of being unfaithful to his science, did not himself marry until 1939 when, predictably, he married another Scottish geologist, Janet Mitchell Dingwall. They were active churchgoers and a devoted couple until her death following a road accident in 1971.<br>
<br>Harrison was tall and spare of build, with a short pointed beard. On first acquaintance he could seem cold, austere, remote; the humanity, together with a keen wit and acid sense of humour, became apparent later. He was fond of music and was an enthusiast for Scottish dancing. But the predominant passion of Harrison's life remained exploration geology in remote places, carried out under the most arduous conditions that could be arranged.<br>
<br>Harrison's work was recognized by his election to FRSE in 1934, by the award of the Lyell medal by the Geological Society in 1961 and by his appointment in 1957 as a grand officer of the Order al Merito por Servicios Distinguidos by the Peruvian government. He died at Oxford on 31 July 1972.<br>
