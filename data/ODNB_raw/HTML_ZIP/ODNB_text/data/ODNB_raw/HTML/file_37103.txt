<span class="headword">Stainsby <span class="st"> [Stavensby]</span>,  Alexander  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1238), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, was in all likelihood a native of Stainsby within Ashby Puerorum, Lincolnshire, where his brothers Gilbert and Master William of Stainsby held land. His parentage and schooling are obscure, though he may well have been a pupil of Stephen Langton, later archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1228), himself a native of a village less than 10 miles from Stainsby. Master Alexander makes his first recorded appearance as witness to a settlement presided over by Archbishop Langton in 1216, in the company of several members of the archbishop's household. A tradition passed down by early historians of the Dominican order would make Stainsby already a teacher of theology at Toulouse in 1215, when his lectures were attended by the order's founder, the future St Dominic. In due course he moved, like Dominic, to Bologna, from whose schools he was promoted chamber clerk to Pope Honorius III (<i>r</i>. 1216&#150;27) before 1224. Stripped of later accretions, the tradition is entirely plausible. A Master Alexander the theologian was indeed associated with the Dominicans of Bologna between 1221 and 1223, while in due course Bishop Alexander of Stainsby is credited with the foundation of Dominican houses at Chester and Derby, and with assisting the establishment of the Dominicans in Oxford. Several members of his episcopal household joined the friars, including his brother Master Richard of Stainsby, author of a revised alphabetical concordance to the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and the great scholar Alexander of Hales (<i>d</i>. 1245), who was afterwards to be the first Franciscan doctor of theology in Paris.<br>
<br>Despite Alexander of Stainsby's own scholarly reputation, his only writings to survive are two short tracts, on the seven deadly sins and on confession, circulated together with his diocesan legislation. Both his statutes, which are remarkable for the number of scriptural quotations they contain, and the tracts show a keen awareness of the reformist approach to preaching, instruction, and penance common both to Dominican spirituality and to the tradition of Stephen Langton and the schools of Paris. Their content and tone alike make it probable that they are the works of Stainsby himself, rather than of some member of his entourage, even though a number of distinguished scholars joined his household.<br>
<br>Stainsby was resident at the papal curia at the time of his election to Coventry in 1224. It was Honorius III who conferred the see upon him, acting as mediator in an election disputed between the secular canons of Lichfield and the monks of Coventry. The monks' election of their own prior as bishop had recently been quashed by Archbishop Langton, who almost certainly approved, though he may not have engineered, the election of Alexander. Stainsby's episcopate was to witness the elevation of Lichfield to equal status with Coventry, and from <i>c</i>.1226 the bishop himself adopted the joint style of bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, in preference to Coventry alone. Following further argument in Rome it was decided that episcopal elections were to fall to the convents of Coventry and Lichfield by turn.<br>
<br>Stainsby also did much to augment the common fund for resident canons at Lichfield, reserving pensions to it from several churches appropriated to monastic houses, securing the endowment of Lichfield's sacristy and of chaplains celebrating masses to the Virgin, and continuing the rebuilding of Lichfield Cathedral begun by his predecessors. He added new prebends to the cathedral's endowment, several of them being bursaries financed from the proceeds of the antiquated papal tax known as &#145;Peter's pence&#146;. In addition he purchased estates to augment the temporal endowment of his see. In 1236, following a long legal battle, Stainsby secured visitation rights over the monks of Coventry. Assiduous in the correction of monastic abuses, he established resident vicars in many churches appropriated to the religious.<br>
<br>Outside the diocese Stainsby's cosmopolitan early career ensured that he was much in demand as a diplomat. He was sent by Henry III to Rome in 1226, 1227, 1228, and 1234; to Antwerp for negotiations with envoys of the emperor Frederick II (<i>r</i>. 1220&#150;50) in 1227; and on several occasions to France or Wales to renew truces. His trip to Rome in 1228 was intended to secure the succession to Archbishop Langton (whom he also served as executor). Politically, Stainsby's interventions were made in company with Langton's other prot&eacute;g&eacute;s among the English bishops. In 1224 he acted as envoy to the disgraced courtier Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; (<i>d</i>. 1226), during the siege of Bedford Castle.<br>
<br>A decade later Stainsby was one of several bishops to oppose the controversial regime of Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1237). Accused before the council in January 1234 of favouring the rebellious Richard Marshal, sixth earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1234), he denied the charge, at the same time excommunicating those whom he dubbed the king's true enemies, a group taken to include Peter des Roches and his alien associates. Besides being one of Henry III's most frequent ambassadors to Rome, Stainsby served many times as papal judge-delegate. He died on 26 December 1238 in Andover, where he had gone to assist the cause of a papal clerk. By a deathbed grant he ensured the foundation at Denhall in the Wirral of a hospital to care for the poor and for those shipwrecked on the passage to Ireland. His body was brought back to Lichfield Cathedral, where he was commemorated in a chantry at the altar of St Ceadda (Chad).<br>
