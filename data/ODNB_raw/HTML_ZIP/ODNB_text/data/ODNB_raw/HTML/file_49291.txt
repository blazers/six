<span class="headword">Heddle,  Charles William Maxwell</span>  (1811/12&#150;1889), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Goree, Senegal, the son of Dr John Heddle (1776&#150;1812), an Orcadian medical officer in the Royal African Corps, and Sophy Boucher, a Senegalese, with whom he had several children. He was educated at the Dollar Academy, Clackmannanshire, at the expense of his uncle, Robert Heddle, who, having made a large fortune trading in Senegal, returned to Orkney in 1818 and bought the estate of Melsetter. Through his uncle's influence he was employed by the London firm of Forster and Smith, then the leading import and export firm in west Africa. After a brief period in the London office he returned about 1834 to west Africa where he spent the rest of his business career.<br>
<br>Heddle began as Forster and Smith's employee in the Gambia, but by 1838 had moved to Freetown, Sierra Leone. There he set up as an import and export trader, at first with locally recruited partners, but after about 1843, having inherited &pound;2000 from an elder brother, a medical officer in India, on his own. He remained Sierra Leone agent for Forster and Smith, and could draw on their credit, while they acted as his agents in London. He traded from the most conspicuous commercial building in Freetown, a huge old store at the government wharf.<br>
<br>It was the start of a period of commercial prosperity in west Africa. By the middle of the nineteenth century many of the Sierra Leone recaptives (those liberated over previous decades from slave ships taking them illegally across the Atlantic) and their descendants had moved into the import&#150;export trade. Freetown was becoming a prosperous commercial centre for the export of oil-bearing produce, increasingly in demand for processing in Europe for lubrication, cooking, and soap making.<br>
<br>Heddle had already begun exporting groundnuts (peanuts) from the Gambia, and is credited with being the first to export them from Sierra Leone. He was also the first entrepreneur to exploit the commercial potentialities of palm kernels, as distinct from palm oil. From the &pound;4 worth he exported in 1846 exports grew until by the 1860s palm kernel exports outstripped the export of palm oil from Sierra Leone and, with groundnuts, had become the mainstay of the export trade.<br>
<br>It was a period when Heddle's African descent was of no serious disadvantage; indeed, during his years in Sierra Leone almost every senior official post, including governor, was at one time or another held by a man of part African descent. Hence he was not subjected to the discriminatory pressures that would have put him at a disadvantage later on during the period of racial imperialism. In 1845 he was appointed a member of the governor's council, and when the constitution was revised in 1863 he became a member of the legislative council.<br>
<br>Much of the export produce was grown along the rivers north of Sierra Leone, still unannexed by any European government. Heddle wanted them annexed to Sierra Leone and in 1845 persuaded the government to make treaties of friendship with the ruling chiefs. But policy in London at this period was against further acquisitions of territory in west Africa and, despite his continuing efforts, they were annexed by the French in 1867.<br>
<br>Heddle is reported as saying that once the first &pound;10,000 has been made the second follows in half the time. But how he made his many thousands is not clear. The total annual import and export figures for Sierra Leone amounted to under &pound;300,000 each at this period, so the profits from import&#150;export trading, shared with many competitors, were limited. He invested extensively in Freetown house properties, but most were valued in hundreds rather than thousands. And although a shrewd property deal with the government netted him &pound;16,000, this was a small sum for a &#145;merchant prince&#146; (as he was called) who was able to write off unconcernedly a loss of between &pound;20,000 and &pound;30,000 when his uninsured warehouse burnt down. It seems likely to suppose that his largest gains were not made directly in west Africa but from investments on the London stock market.<br>
<br>In 1871 he left Sierra Leone, lame, and with impaired eyesight, and retired to France, where he purchased a former ducal mansion, the Ch&acirc;teau de M&eacute;r&eacute;ville, Seine-et-Oise, which he furnished opulently. He had never married, though with Emilie Caille (<i>d</i>. 1876), with whom he lived during his years in Freetown, he had an illegitimate son, John, whom he adopted legally. However, on 4 September 1888, aged then seventy-six, he married a twenty-two year old divorcee, Marie L&eacute;ocadie Hortense Prume, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leduc (<i>c</i>.1867&#150;1898). He died at Cannes some eight months later on 29 April 1889. His will, leaving almost everything to his young widow, was contested in the courts, and eventually the estate was shared by settlement between her and his son. She died soon after, as the result of a car crash; he squandered his inheritance and died in debt. Neither left descendants.<br>
<br>Heddle's estate was valued for probate at &pound;352,018 16<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. Adding to this the money spent buying and maintaining his ch&acirc;teau, and his wife's marriage settlement, the fortune he had gained from his entrepreneurial activities is likely to be closer to half a million than quarter of a million pounds, a fortune far outstripping that of any contemporary in west Africa.<br>
