<span class="headword">Richardson,  (Sarah) Katharine <span class="st"> [Katy]</span></span>  (1854&#150;1927), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born on 24 April 1854, at Edlington, near Doncaster, Yorkshire, the second of five daughters of the Revd George Richardson, curate of Edlington and later vicar of Kilburn, Yorkshire, and his wife, Isabel Nussey. She first visited the Alps at the age of sixteen. After 1879 Katharine became a distinguished mountaineer, making 176 ascents over 11 climbing seasons, 116 of which were considered major ascents (including 6 first ascents and 14 first ascents by a woman). Although short, petite, and thin, her endurance and agility were remarkable. In 1882, for example, she climbed Zinal Rothorn, Weisshorn, Matterhorn, and Monte Rosa in eight days, and in 1889 she climbed the Aiguille Verte, Grand Dru, and Petit Dru in just three days. Michel Payot, a guide, said of her: &#145;she glides along the rocks like a lizard&#146;  (Paillon, 329).<br>
<br>Katharine Richardson's reputation as a climber often preceded her. In 1888 she made the first ascent of the Aiguille de Bionnassy, including a traverse to the D&ocirc;me du Go&ucirc;ter which had been considered impossible, and the first female ascent of Aiguilles des Charmoz. While still in Chamonix, she read in a newspaper that an Englishwoman had arrived in La B&eacute;rarde intending to make the first female ascent of the Meije. She quickly travelled to the Dauphin&eacute;, where she inquired as to the name of her compatriot and competitor. The name she was told, however, was none other than her own. Fulfilling the prophecy, she climbed the Meije with Pierre Gaspard and J. B. Bich, and observers below recognized her on the summit by her petite stature and skirt.<br>
<br>One of these observers was Mary Paillon (1848&#150;1946), from a French medical family, who met Richardson afterwards and arranged to climb with her the following year. They became close friends and Richardson settled at Oullins, near Lyons, on the Paillon family estate, where she lived for the rest of her life. Richardson had a round face, full nose, green eyes, pulled her straight, brown hair back, and invariably wore a skirt while climbing. Paillon had high cheekbones, a thin, Gallic nose, close-cropped, wavy hair, wore a pince-nez, and was a strong advocate for women climbing in trousers. The two women often climbed together, including Pelvoux in 1897, one of the peaks of which was later named Pointe Richardson. After this ascent Paillon's eyesight began to fail and they attempted only less difficult walks. Richardson refused to climb peaks on which Paillon could not join her. They were both members of the Lyonnaise section of the Club Alpin Fran&ccedil;ais, and they joined the Ladies' Alpine Club in 1908; Paillon was elected vice-president in 1910, and Richardson declined the presidency in 1912 and 1919. Richardson was also a distinguished watercolourist. She died on 20 August 1927 at the Paillon home, 48 rue de la R&eacute;publique, Oullins, Rh&ocirc;ne, France. Paillon wrote innumerable articles for climbing journals, including an obituary notice on Richardson that said she had been &#145;almost a sister to me&#146;  (Paillon, 326). Neither ever married.<br>
