<span class="headword">&Oacute; D&aacute;laigh <span class="st"> [Ua D&aacute;laig, O'Daly]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1100&#150;<em>c.</em>1620), <span class="occ">poets</span>, apparently originated as local chieftains of Corcu Ro&iacute;de (roughly the barony of Corkaree, Westmeath). Five eminent <i>ollamhain</i> (&#145;master poets&#146;) of the surname are recorded during the twelfth century, the first of whom, C&uacute; Chonnacht Ua D&aacute;laig, described in the annals of Tigernach as &#145;the best poet in Ireland&#146; died in 1139 as an old man in religious retirement at the ecclesiastical settlement of Clonard. Mael &Iacute;sa Ua D&aacute;laig (<i>d</i>. 1185), whom the annals of Loch C&eacute; call the &#145;master-poet of Ireland and Scotland, and high chieftain of Corcu Ro&iacute;de&#146;, also died in old age at Clonard. Two others, Ragnall (<i>d</i>. 1161), and Gilla na Trin&oacute;iti (<i>d</i>. 1165), are described as master poets for the kingdom of Desmond, or south Munster, indicating that they were court poets to the Mac Carthaig kings there. The family acquired in the course of this century an extraordinarily high reputation, being among the earliest practitioners of the newly regulated art of <i>d&aacute;n d&iacute;reach</i> (&#145;strict composition&#146;), though no extant texts attributed to its members predate the early thirteenth century.<br>
<br>A number of fresh and elegant compositions ascribed to <a name="cosubject_20535"></a><span class="headword">Muireadhach &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1213)<span class="occ"></span> of Lissadill, Sligo, date from this period. The two best-known  (Bergin, nos. 20, 22) are: first, his address to the young Richard de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1243), <span class="italic">Cr&eacute;d agaibh aoidhigh a gc&eacute;in?</span> (&#145;Whence comes it that ye have guests from afar?&#146;) in which he styles himself &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Midhe, and petitions the Anglo-Norman lord for refuge from the anger of Domhnall &Oacute; Domhnaill, king of T&iacute;r Conaill (<i>r</i>. 1208&#150;41), whose servant he has killed in a quarrel; and, second, his lament for his dead wife, Maol Mheadha&#151;<span class="italic">M'anam do sgar riomsa araoir</span> (&#145;My soul parted from me last night&#146;), mourning her as his first love, who during twenty years of marriage had borne him eleven children. The account of his life in the annals is a semi-legendary composition of a later century. It relates that he went to Scotland after his exile by &Oacute; Domhnaill, and he has been claimed as the ancestor of the distinguished Scottish poetic family of MacMhuireadhaigh. Fifteenth-century Irish genealogies (Royal Irish Academy, MS 1233, fol. 36<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>) assert that Muireadhach of Lissadill was brother to the celebrated <a name="cosubject_20534"></a><span class="headword">Donnchadh  M&oacute;r &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1244)<span class="occ"></span>, &#145;a master of poetry who never has been excelled and never will be&#146;, according to the annals of Connacht, where it is also stated that he was buried in the Cistercian monastery of Boyle; another version of his obit says that he kept a guest house, or hostel for travellers, a charity commonly offered by Irish scholars at the top of their profession. Such was his reputation as a religious poet that many folk hymns and ballads of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have been fathered on him, but a group of poems preserved in the fourteenth-century <span class="roman">Book of U&iacute; Mhaine</span>  (McKenna, <span class="italic">D&aacute;n D&eacute;</span>) are probably genuine compositions of Donnchadh M&oacute;r. They are long and austere, and do not translate well, but the Irish text corruscates with redundance of rhyme, since like all true bardic poetry it was intended for public recitation. In <span class="italic">Gabham deachmhaidh ar nd&aacute;na</span> Donnchadh M&oacute;r pledges to address a tithe of all his professional eulogies to God, and ends with a prayer that those learning or reciting his poem may receive heaven as their reward. Very few of his secular poems survive, the most striking being his lament for the death of his son Aonghus, <span class="italic">Ar iasacht fhuaras Aonghus</span> (&#145;I obtained Aonghus on loan&#146;; MacCionaith, <span class="italic">Dioghluim D&aacute;na</span>, no. 69). Another possible example is a eulogy for the three sons of Mac Giollamhuire (a chief in north Down): <span class="italic">Cuaine r&iacute;oghna rug &Eacute;adaoin</span> (&#145;&Eacute;adaoin bore a queen's litter [of whelps]&#146;; Book of the Dean of Lismore, p. 75; NL Ire., MS 992, fol. 37), which ends with an envoi to Aodh, son of Aodh &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, who may be the king <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20774/', "Aodh M&#233;ith &#211; N&#233;ill (d. 1230)")</script>.<br>
<br>Some poems from late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century Connacht are ascribed to Mac Cearbhaill Bhuidhe (&#145;Son of Yellow-Haired Cearbhall&#146;), perhaps for a time the title of the head of a particular line in the &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh family. Cearbhall Buidhe &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh himself died in 1245. His son Tadhg, court poet to Aodh son of Feidhlim &Oacute; Conchobhair, king of Connacht, died in 1274, the same year as his patron. Another Mac Cearbhaill Bhuidhe, court poet to Aodh, son of Eoghan &Oacute; Conchobhair, king of Connacht (<i>r</i>. 1296&#150;1309), composed one, perhaps both, of two poems in honour of the king's palace (MacCionaith, no. 119; Quiggin, 333&#150;52), the first variously ascribed to C&uacute;chonnacht son of Cearbhall Buidhe, Aonghus son of Cearbhall Buidhe, or Aonghus son of Tadhg son of Cearbhall Buidhe, and the second attributed to Aonghus Ruadh &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh, or Aonghus son of Cearbhall Ruadh (Red-Haired Cearbhall) &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh. The other Mac Cearbhaill Bhuidhe poems are also of a high quality, but most remain unpublished. Genealogies indicate that the line of &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Breifneach, who composed poems for the &Oacute; Raighilligh chieftains in the late medieval and early modern period, descended from this section of the family.<br>
<br>In the mid-fourteenth century the main line of &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Midhe (&Oacute; D&aacute;laigh of Meath) divided, when its head, <a name="cosubject_20532"></a><span class="headword">Aonghus  Ruadh &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1350)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Donnchadh son of Aonghus son of Donnchadh M&oacute;r, quarrelled with a local chief in co. Westmeath, Ruaidhr&iacute; &Oacute; Maolmhuaidh (<i>d</i>. 1383). In a poem to the latter, <span class="italic">Ceangal do sh&iacute;oth riom a Ruaidhri</span>  (McKenna, &#145;Irish bardic poems&#146;, 317&#150;25), Aonghus Ruadh threatened that if the quarrel were not resolved, he would reside with the more prominent &Oacute; Briain chieftains of Thomond, in modern co. Clare. The existence in 1415 of a line of &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh of Corcumroe, Clare, headed by Fearghal (<i>d</i>. 1420), son of Tadhg son of Aonghus Ruadh, suggests that this threat was fulfilled.<br>
<br>However, from the fourteenth century onwards the poetic gifts of the Meath, Breifne, and Corcumroe lines of the family were outshone by the Munster branches of &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Fionn (&Oacute; D&aacute;laigh the Fair) and &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Cairbreach (&Oacute; D&aacute;laigh of Carbery, barony, in west Cork). This trend began with the career of <a name="cosubject_56826"></a><span class="headword">Gofraidh &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Fionn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1387)<span class="occ"></span>, styled by the annals of Ulster <i>Ollam Erenn re d&aacute;n</i> (&#145;chief master of Ireland in the art of poetry&#146;). Educated by the Mac Craith poets of Thomond, he soon outdid his teachers, much to their disgust, as the poem <span class="italic">Mairg chaitheas dl&uacute;s re dalta</span>  (&#145;Woe to him who favours a pupil&#146;; MacCionaith, no. 104) suggests. Gofraidh's earliest patron was Conchobhar &Oacute; Briain (<i>d</i>. 1328), but he also addressed chiefs of T&iacute;r Conaill and U&iacute; Mhaine, besides Mac Carthaigh M&oacute;r, Mac Carthaigh Cairbreach, and their sub-chieftains, and was court poet to the first, second, and third earls of Desmond. His association with the third earl, Gerald the Rhymer 
    (Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, <i>d</i>. 1398)
  , began during the latter's childhood and may have influenced the earl's subsequent development as an amateur poet in the Irish language. In some famous verses to the child Gerald and his father Maurice, the first earl, Gofraidh states: &#145;In the foreigners' poems we promise that the Irish shall be driven from Ireland, in the Irishmen's poems we promise that the foreigners shall be routed across the sea&#146;  (MacCionaith, no. 67). Religious poems and verse tracts on the composition of poetry are also attributed to him.<br>
<br>By the sixteenth century a branch of the &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh family had settled at Pallis, Wexford. One member was Aonghus son of Doighre &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh (<i>fl</i>. 1598), poet to the Gabhal Raghnallach, or clan Ranelagh O'Byrnes. From this branch also came the semi-legendary lover of the seventeenth century, Cearbhall na mBan (Cearbhall of the Women). However most prominent at this time was the Munsterman <a name="cosubject_56827"></a><span class="headword">Aonghus &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Fionn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1601<span class="mult">x</span>9), son of Amhlaoibh &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Fionn and author of a lament for Domhnall Mac Carthaigh, earl of Clancare (<i>d</i>. 1596): <span class="italic">Soraidh led ch&eacute;ile a Chaisil</span>  (&#145;Farewell to thy Husband, O Cashel!&#146;; <span class="roman">Book of O'Conor Don</span>, Royal Irish Academy, MS 2, fol. 363a), and one for the latter's son Tadhg, baron of Valencia (<i>d</i>. 1587/8): <span class="italic">A theachtaire thig &oacute;'n bhFrainnc</span>  (&#145;Messenger who comes from France&#146;; Royal Irish Academy, MS 490, p. 151). After the earl's death &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Fionn appears to have concentrated on religious compositions, becoming nicknamed Aonghus na Diadhachta (Aonghus of the Divinity). He ran a poetic school at his residence in Duhallow, under the patronage of the local chief, Domhnall &Oacute; Caoimh, who died in the same year as his eminent prot&eacute;g&eacute;. A contemporary, Aonghus Ruadh, or Aonghus na nAor (Aonghus of the Satires) &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh (<i>d</i>. 1617) lived on the peninsula of Muntervary in West Carbery, and composed a libellous poem, &#145;The tribes of Ireland&#146;. From the same period, Lochlainn (<i>fl</i>. 1596&#150;1620) son of Tadhg &Oacute;g &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh, probably of the &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh Breifneach branch, is a transitional figure, who composed genre poetry as well as eulogies for patrons, including a lament for the collapse of Gaelic society in the wake of the plantations, <span class="italic">C'&aacute;it ar ghabhadar Gaoidhil?</span> (&#145;Where have the Gaels gone?&#146;), which mentions the new generation's indifference to his family's historic profession.<br>
