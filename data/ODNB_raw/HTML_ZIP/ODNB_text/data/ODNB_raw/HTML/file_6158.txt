<span class="headword">Cooke,  Edward</span>  (1772&#150;1799), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 14 April 1772, the son of Colonel George John Cooke of Harefield, Middlesex, and Penelope, only daughter of Sir William Bowyer, third baronet, and Anne Stonhouse. His brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6162/', "General Sir George Cooke")</script>, army officer, who commanded the first division at Waterloo, and Major-General Sir Henry Frederick Cooke, private secretary to the duke of York. Following the death of Edward Cooke's father, his mother married General Edward Smith, uncle of Admiral Sir W. Sidney Smith.<br>
<br>Cooke entered the navy and was made lieutenant on 14 September 1790. In 1793 he was appointed to the <i>Victory</i>, going to the Mediterranean as Lord Hood's flagship. In August he was entrusted with the negotiations with the royalist inhabitants of Toulon, a service which he conducted with skill and boldness, and which resulted in Lord Hood's obtaining possession of the town and arsenal. Cooke was then appointed Toulon's lieutenant-governor and served with the governor, Captain George Elphinstone (later Viscount Keith). He continued in this post until the town's evacuation at the end of December. His services were rewarded by promotion, and on 12 April 1794 he was advanced to the rank of post captain. He took charge of the landing for the siege of Calvi in June 1794, and played an active part in subsequent operations, his zeal drawing the praise of Nelson, under whose immediate orders he was serving.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1794 Cooke was appointed to the <i>Sibylle</i>, a fine (40-gun) frigate, recently captured from the French, and in her he went out to the Cape of Good Hope, from where he was sent on to the East Indies to escort home the China trade. In early January 1798, in company with Captain Charles Malcolm of the <i>Fox</i>, he reconnoitred the Spanish force in the Philippines with the hope, if possible, of capturing two richly laden ships reported as ready to sail from Manila. As they neared the islands it occurred to Cooke that they might pass themselves off as French. The <i>Sibylle</i>, a French-built ship, was easily disguised, as was the <i>Fox</i> once it had been repainted. Between them, Cooke and an officer on the <i>Fox</i> spoke fluent French and some Spanish.<br>
<br>On 14 January the two frigates were off Manila where they aroused no suspicion. The guardboats came alongside, and the Spanish officers were taken down to the cabin and hospitably entertained, while in the foremost part of the ship the Spanish seamen were stripped, and British sailors dressed in their clothes were sent away in the guardboats to capture what they could. They thus took the Spanish entirely by surprise and brought off three large gunboats. By the time the townsmen and the garrison realized that the two frigates were British, Cooke and Malcolm, in friendly talk with the Spanish officers, had gained much confidential information. They then sent them on shore along with the 200 prisoners, and, with the three gunboats in tow, stood out of the bay.<br>
<br>In February 1799 the <i>Sibylle</i> was lying at Madras when Cooke learned that the French frigate <i>Forte</i> was in the Bay of Bengal, and on 19 February he put to sea in search of her. On the evening of 28 February the <i>Sibylle</i> was off the Sand-heads; about nine o'clock she made out three ships, which she understood to be the <i>Forte</i> and two recently captured country ships. The <i>Forte</i> supposed that the <i>Sibylle</i> was another merchant ship and ordered her to strike. The <i>Sibylle</i> closed at once, and, with her main yard between the enemy's main and mizen masts, poured in a broadside and shower of musketry with deadly effect. The <i>Forte</i> was taken by surprise; the terrible broadside was the first intimation that she had to contend with the largest British frigate on the station. For nearly an hour the two ships lay broadside to broadside at a distance seldom greater than pistol shot. At about 1.30 a.m. Cooke was wounded by grape shot to the chest and shoulder. The action was then maintained by Lucius Hardyman, the first lieutenant. At 2.30 a.m. the <i>Forte</i>, being entirely dismasted, and having lost 150 men killed and wounded, struck her colours. She was at the time the largest and most heavily armed frigate afloat, being about one-third larger than the <i>Sibylle</i>, and carrying 24-pounders on her main deck, as against the <i>Sibylle's</i> 18-pounders. By comparison the <i>Sibylle's</i> loss was comparatively slight.<br>
<br>The darkness of the night, and the superior discipline and training of the <i>Sibylle's</i> crew are principal factors in explaining what proved to be one of the eighteenth century's most brilliant frigate actions. Lucius Hardyman was immediately promoted commander, and in January 1800 captain, of the <i>Forte</i>. However, Cooke's wounds proved fatal. After lingering for some months in extreme agony he died at Calcutta on 25 May 1799. He was buried there with the highest military honours; a monument was erected to his memory by the directors of the East India Company.<br>
