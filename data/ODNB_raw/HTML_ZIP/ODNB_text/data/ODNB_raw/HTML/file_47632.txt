<span class="headword">Haslam <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fisher]</span>,  Anna Maria</span>  (1829&#150;1922), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born in Youghal, co. Cork, in April 1829, sixteenth of the seventeen children of Abraham Fisher (1783&#150;1871), a corn miller, and his wife, Jane Moor (1789&#150;1877), of Neath, Wales. She had eight sisters and eight brothers. She was educated at the Quaker school at Newtown, co. Waterford, from 1840 to 1842, and then, until 1845, at the Quaker school at Castlegate in York. Her parents were active in the anti-slavery, temperance, and international peace movements, and the family helped in a soup kitchen in Youghal during the great famine. Anna later linked her activism in women's rights to her upbringing, noting in an interview that she &#145;could not remember any time when she was not a believer in women's equality. It came to her naturally and was always taken for granted in her household&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Citizen</span>, 21 March 1914).<br>
<br>From 1847 Anna taught at Ackworth School, Yorkshire, where she met her future husband, a fellow <span class="occ">teacher</span>, <a name="cosubject_54137"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Joseph Haslam</span>  (1825&#150;1917). Born in Mountmellick, Queen's county, he had been educated at the Quaker provincial school in that town. In 1840 he became an apprentice teacher at the Friends' School, Lisburn. He became interested in the issue of women's suffrage from reading the works of Herbert Spencer. The couple returned to Ireland and married in Cork in 1854. They then moved to Dublin, where Thomas was employed as a clerk, but in 1866 his health broke down and Anna was left to support them both. This she did by opening a &#145;stationer's and fancy goods repository&#146; at their home in Rathmines, Dublin; the business survived until 1906, when the assistance of friends made the enterprise unnecessary. The nature of Thomas's illness remains a mystery, and he continued to be an active scholar, a member of the Rathmines Public Library Committee, and a &#145;great figure&#146; at the Dublin Friends Institute, where he regularly read papers. The marriage appears to have been a particularly happy one; there were no children. The suffragist Margaret Cousins, who met the Haslams in 1906, described them as &#145;a remarkable old pair, devoted to one another and dedicated to the cause of the advancement and enfranchisement of women &hellip; she a dynamo of energy, small and sturdy; he intellectual, tall, rather like a university don, a good speaker, very refined and kindly&#146;  (Cousins and Cousins, 129).<br>
<br>Anna Haslam's interests spanned a range of organizations and campaigns. In 1861 she helped establish the Irish Society for the Training and Employment of Educated Women in Dublin. She campaigned to have girls included in the <span class="roman">Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act</span> of 1878, and in 1882 was involved in setting up the Association of Schoolmistresses and Other Ladies Interested in Irish Education, which sought to protect rights won for girls' education and to fight for further changes. In 1870 she established a branch of the Ladies' National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts in Dublin. She also served as an executive committee member of the National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. In 1886 she became secretary to the Women's Vigilance Committee, part of the social purity movement which developed from the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> campaign. When the First World War broke out in 1914 she was instrumental in setting up &#145;women patrols&#146; which aimed to keep young girls off the streets of Dublin for fear they would fall into prostitution.<br>
<br>Anna Haslam established the first suffrage society in Dublin in 1876. After many name changes, this organization was to become the Irish Women's Suffrage and Local Government Association (IWSLGA) in 1901. She was secretary to this association from 1876 until 1913, and was then elected life president. A pacifist throughout her life, she did not support the militant tactics of the Irish Women's Franchise League. In addition to campaigning for the national franchise, the IWSLGA also sought to win the right for women to become poor-law guardians and to vote in municipal elections, rights which were eventually won in 1896 and 1898 respectively. Anna Haslam, a leading figure in these campaigns, wrote a number of articles on these issues in the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span>.<br>
<br>Anna Haslam was a staunch unionist and opposed the introduction of home rule for Ireland, fearing that its passage would result in the loyalists of Ireland being &#145;politically extinguished&#146;. She nevertheless welcomed women and men of all political persuasions and all religious denominations into her organizations. To the end of her life she was held in very real affection by feminists of widely differing political opinions.<br>
<br>In the 1918 election, the first in which women over thirty were allowed to vote, Anna Haslam was paraded to the polling booth by members of different suffrage groups, as a symbol of the long years of struggle to attain the franchise. Thomas Haslam, a significant feminist in his own right, did not live to see his wife cast her vote. Like his wife, he had devoted his energies to securing rights for women, and had been active in the IWSLGA. Interested in birth control, he published <span class="italic">The Marriage Problem</span> on the subject in 1868 under the pseudonym Oedipus. In 1870 he wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Few Words on Prostitution and the Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, as a contribution to the Irish campaign for the repeal of the acts. He published the first newspaper in Ireland to support women's suffrage, the <span class="italic">Women's Advocate</span>; but it ran to only three issues, in April, May, and July 1874. He wrote a number of pamphlets on women's suffrage, the last being published in 1916, a year before his death. He was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Temple Hill, Blackrock, in co. Dublin. Anna Haslam died in Dublin on 28 November 1922 at the age of ninety-three, and was buried beside her husband in the Quaker burial-ground.<br>
