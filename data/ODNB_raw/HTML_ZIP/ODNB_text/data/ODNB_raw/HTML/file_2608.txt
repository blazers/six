<span class="headword">Bland,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1555), <span class="occ">protestant martyr</span>, was born at Sedbergh, Yorkshire, and was educated by Roger Lupton, the provost of Eton College, before becoming a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of MA in 1536. According to John Foxe, Bland was at some point in his career the teacher of Edwin Sandys, a fellow Yorkshireman and alumnus of St John's, who went on to become archbishop of York. In 1537 Bland was presented to the living of Ospringe, Kent, which was in the gift of St John's. In Kent he came under the wing of Christopher Nevinson, the archbishop's commissary; in 1541 Bland received the substantial archiepiscopal living of Adisham, Kent, from Nevinson. Bland made his presence felt not only in his livings, but throughout the diocese. In the winter of 1542&#150;3, in addition to stripping his church at Ospringe of images and furnishings, he preached in Faversham, Canterbury, and the surrounding area, denouncing images, fast days, prayer to saints, and other &#145;superstitious&#146; practices. He also repeatedly preached that confession was unnecessary. At the same time, Bland was associating with protestant radicals, including some with direct ties to the Anabaptist Joan Bocher. (Significantly, when Bland was arrested a decade later, some Kentish freewillers would rally to his defence.)<br>
<br>How radical Bland's own views were is hard to determine. He was accused of making some statements in 1542&#150;3 which pushed against the envelope of prevailing English protestant orthodoxy: that the mass was just a remembrance, &#145;that in the christening of children priests be murderers&#146;, and that the term <i>Trinitas</i> was not scriptural but was coined by Athanasius  (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 128, pp. 67, 69, and 71). On the other hand, it is difficult to believe that Bland would have retained the support of both Nevinson and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer had his religious radicalism been too pronounced. The patronage of Cranmer and Nevinson, along with Bland's outspoken protestantism, made him a natural target for religious conservatives in Kent, and in the spring of 1543 his heresies were denounced to the king, as part of the conspiracy against Archbishop Cranmer which became known as the prebendaries' plot. Almost immediately the protestants in Cranmer's circle rallied round Bland. Nevinson resigned to him a prebend which he had held, and Rowland Taylor and Ralph Morrice, two zealous evangelicals closely associated with Cranmer, stood surety for the payment of first fruits for Bland's new living. Bland himself preached a defiant Palm Sunday sermon at Adisham, in which he denounced the hallowing of palms and other traditional ceremonies. In his sermon Bland also claimed that he had been commanded to preach on these topics by certain members of the privy council. Nevertheless, he was indicted for heresy on 27 September 1543, although the case against him disintegrated once it became clear that Cranmer retained Henry VIII's support.<br>
<br>Mary's accession, and Cranmer's consequent disgrace, left Bland dangerously isolated. On 3 September 1553 Bland got into a dispute with John Austen, one of his churchwardens; when Austen tried to remove the communion table from the church at Adisham, Bland, with the support of Edward Isaac, a stalwart protestant JP, instituted legal proceedings against him. On 26 October, Thomas Austen, another churchwarden, demanded that Bland rebuild the altar and pay for the restoration of a rood loft he had destroyed. Bland refused. The conservative faction in Adisham procured a priest from a neighbouring parish to celebrate mass. But on 28 December Bland disrupted the planned service and vehemently denounced the mass as an invention of Antichrist. He was assaulted by the churchwardens and then arrested, along with Laurence Ramsey, the former parish clerk of Adisham and a close ally of Bland's. (And perhaps significantly, Ramsey had been a freewiller as late as 1551.) Bland (who was also denounced as a married priest) and Ramsey were both taken to Canterbury, where they were released under bond.<br>
<br>If this had been merely a local dispute the matter might have ended here, but Bland's past came back to haunt him. In late February 1554, Sir Thomas Moyle, one of the former leaders of the prebendaries' plot, who had organized the accusations of heresy against Bland in 1543, ordered that Bland's bail be revoked. For the next year an elaborate cat and mouse game ensued as Bland was re-released on bail, then arraigned in an ecclesiastical court, then transferred to the county sessions, and finally transferred back to spiritual jurisdiction. The object of this manoeuvring was to keep Bland detained, so that he could face heresy charges the moment that the statute criminalizing heresy, which had been repealed in the previous reign, was re-enacted. Having been informally examined by Nicholas Harpsfield, the archdeacon of Canterbury, Bland was examined in the chapter house of Canterbury Cathedral on 21 May 1554. This remarkable session, which took place almost a year before Bland was actually tried for heresy, demonstrates the importance the diocesan authorities attached to this case. A particularly striking feature of this examination was that Cyriac Pettit, a layman (who had been deeply involved in the prebendaries' plot), took the lead in interrogating Bland. A little over a month after this ordeal, Bland was interrogated at the county sessions by Sir Thomas Moyle and Sir John Baker (another of the leaders of the prebendaries' plot).<br>
<br>In February 1555, with the heresy statute finally re-enacted, Bland was interrogated for a final time by Sir John Baker, and then transferred to spiritual jurisdiction. Richard Thornden, the suffragan bishop of Dover, and a long-standing adversary of Cranmer, took charge of Bland's protracted trial in the spring of 1555. Bland was condemned on 25 June 1555. He was burnt at Canterbury on 12 July, along with&#151;in vivid, if not necessarily intentional, symbolism&#151;another Edwardian cleric and two radical protestants. To a remarkable degree, Bland's career epitomizes the early Reformation in Kent. The staunch support and implacable enmity Bland attracted as a particularly active agent of evangelical reform are indications of the passions that would make Kent a burnt-over district, both literally and figuratively, by the end of Mary's reign. A belated but not insignificant sign of the changing of the old order in the county was a payment of 5<i>s</i>. made in the spring of 1576 by the chapter of Canterbury Cathedral to &#145;John Blande whose father was brent to help him withall&#146;  (Canterbury city and cathedral archives, misc. accounts, 40, fol. 451<i>r</i>).<br>
