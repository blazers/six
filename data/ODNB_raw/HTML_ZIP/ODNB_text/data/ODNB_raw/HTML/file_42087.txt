<span class="headword">Horrabin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Batho]</span>,  Winifred</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Freda Wynne]</span>  (1887&#150;1971), <span class="occ">socialist and journalist</span>, was born on 9 August 1887 in Sheffield, the fourth of the six children (three died in infancy) of Arthur John Batho (1855/6&#150;1891), postal telegraph clerk, and his wife, Lilian Outram (1858/9&#150;1938). Her parents came from artisan families and were members of the Wicker Congregational Church. Her father sailed to South Africa on the SS <i>Durban</i> in 1890 hoping to cure his tuberculosis, but, shortly after being joined by his family, he died and was buried in Graaff-Reinet in May 1891.<br>
<br>Batho returned to Sheffield and attended the Central School, then the Sheffield School of Art from 1907 where she met her future husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33995/', "James Francis Horrabin (1884&#150;1962)")</script>, the cartoonist and cartographer. Her political awakening reflected the legacy of her father's death; she became anti-Boer and felt a close affinity with the South African feminist and socialist Olive Schreiner, whose biography she began to write. Batho joined the Women's Social and Political Union and disrupted a speech by Winston Churchill in 1909 with the suffragettes' cry &#145;votes for women&#146;. She &#145;converted&#146; to guild socialism &#145;via William Morris art&#146;  (Horrabin MS DWH/1/64) and wrote a play, &#145;Victorian Love Story: Beloved Good&#146;, about Thomas Carlyle and his wife, Jane.<br>
<br>Winifred Batho and James Horrabin were married on 11 August 1911 and moved to London. Together they worked in the labour college movement: they favoured independent workers' education and published these views in <span class="italic">Working Class Education</span> in 1924. Horrabin was honorary secretary of the Plebs League and edited <span class="italic">The Plebs</span>. She joined the Communist Party and delivered a paper in 1912 to the Fabian Society in which she argued that only the destruction of private property would release women from economic slavery (<span class="italic">Is Woman's Place the Home?</span>, published in 1933). During the First World War she began writing an autobiographical novel about a wartime love affair.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Horrabin became internationalist and pacifist in her outlook. She visited Russia in 1926, meeting N. K. Krupskaya and making a pilgrimage to Lenin's tomb. In Poland she observed a mass trial of political dissidents. When her younger brother, Harold Batho, died from First World War injuries in 1932, she told the National Conference of Labour Women that the international working classes should resist war, choosing starvation over employment in munitions factories.<br>
<br>In 1937 Horrabin began reviewing films and books for <span class="italic">The Tribune</span> (she continued until 1948), beginning a long career in journalism which included travel writing, social commentary, and short stories for journals such as <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>. She had a weekly column in the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span> from 1944 under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Freda Wynne. In 1938 Horrabin's mother died, Horrabin's novel was rejected by publishers, and she was diagnosed as having an ovarian cyst. She underwent a hysterectomy in February 1939. She moved to Oxford at the outbreak of war and in March 1942 her husband, who was immersed in his second extramarital affair, asked for a separation. Despite knowledge of his adultery, she was devastated and sought psychoanalytical treatment. On 13 October 1947 the marriage was dissolved. Horrabin lived and worked for six months in Jamaica before moving to Blackheath in 1950.<br>
<br>Horrabin's final years were marred by loneliness and a deep sense of failure. In 1951 her elder brother, Arthur (Artie) Denton Batho, died, leaving her without family, and she never fully recovered from the dissolution of her marriage. She compiled, but did not publish, &#145;The Summer of a Dormouse&#146;, a series of autobiographical essays. Their significance lies in her recollection of suffragist work with Adela Pankhurst in 1909 and socialist contacts in the 1920s and 1930s such as Harold Laski and H. G. Wells. She polished her novel and gave it the title &#145;After which War?&#146;, but, like her play and the Schreiner biography, it remained unpublished. She died at her home, Sandycross, Ridgeway Road, Dorking, Surrey, on 24 June 1971 and was cremated at Randall's Park crematorium, Leatherhead, on 30 June. Her estate of &pound;185 was bequeathed to Robert Alfred Blatchford.<br>
