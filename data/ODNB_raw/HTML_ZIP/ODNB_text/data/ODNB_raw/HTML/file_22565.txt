<span class="headword">Porter,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Captain Porter]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1659&#150;1728), <span class="occ">Jacobite conspirator and informer</span>, was probably born in London, the only son of the dramatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22579/', "Thomas Porter (1636&#150;1680)")</script> by his second, legal, marriage to his first wife Anne Blount (<i>c</i>.1637&#150;1659). His paternal grandfather was the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22562/', "Endymion Porter")</script>. Porter inherited his fatness, Catholicism, and a streak of crazy violence from his father. He received a &pound;5000 legacy under the will of his maternal grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2692/', "Mountjoy Blount, first earl of Newport")</script>. This was tripled after his cousin Anne Knollys, by marrying without consent, forfeited to him Newport House near Charing Cross, their childhood home. He sold it for redevelopment in 1682 for &pound;9500; a Porter Street, named after him, was destroyed in cutting Charing Cross Road. During the 1680s he wasted his inheritance in gross debauchery. On 11 October 1684 he mortally wounded Sir James Halkett when jostled at Dorset Garden playhouse. He was convicted of manslaughter but pardoned. When in 1688 he bought a &pound;200 annuity from Thomas Bruce, earl of Ailesbury, venereal disease and quarrelsomeness made him an apparently bad &#145;life&#146;.<br>
<br>Before William of Orange's invasion Porter became captain of a proposed new troop in Henry Slingsby's regiment. In summer 1689 he prepared a rising against the new king at Epsom, his frequent haunt. He was named in the proclamation of 9 May 1692, but surrendered after the French invasion attempt failed. In 1693 Colonel John Parker made him senior captain of his Jacobite cavalry regiment. In May 1695 Sir William Parkyns brought Porter to two tavern meetings at which Jacobites headed by Ailesbury, Viscount Montgomery, and Sir John Fenwick sent his fellow captain Robert Charnock to France seeking an immediate invasion. Characteristically, Porter then helped to turn a Jacobite demonstration in Drury Lane on 10 June into a counterproductive drunken riot, which left him and other Jacobite officers detained, awaiting trial just when the invasion was hoped for. Despite similar indiscretions Porter's criminal activities, including highway robbery, made him a suitable participant in the plots to kidnap or murder William, discussed by extremists every winter from that of 1693&#150;4 onward. Sir George Barclay, Charnock, and Parkyns therefore initiated him early into the 1696 assassination plot, and he took a leading part in planning and recruiting for it. However, he unintentionally doomed the conspiracy by recruiting his friend Thomas Prendergast, who was horrified and betrayed it. When William avoided going hunting on 22 February 1696, the assassins scattered.<br>
<br>A proclamation offered &pound;1000 for each of the conspirators, and Porter, his servant Thomas Keyes, and Prendergast were captured on 27 February at Leatherhead. Unaware of Prendergast's determination to save him, Porter instantly offered to betray his comrades, demanding not only life but rewards. William promised a pardon, and on 28 February Porter made a full confession, which falsely implicated James II. On 11 March Porter was the main witness against Charnock, Edward King, and Keyes. That his testimony hanged the servant whom he had inveigled into the plot provoked widespread disgust. To ensure his being rewarded, Porter was required to take part in the prosecution of the Jacobite leaders who had supported Charnock's 1695 mission. This required a second witness, and he pretended that his fellow assassin Cardell Goodman had attended one meeting. Goodman deduced from his interrogators' clumsy leading questions what they believed he knew, and grasped Porter's lifeline. The perjury made Ailesbury feel justified in lying (even in his memoirs) about the 1695 meetings, and pretending that Porter had been the earl of Portland's <i>agent provocateur</i>. Porter continued to testify against other fellow assassins, including Parkyns, Ambrose Rookwood, and (changing his testimony to hang another subordinate) Charles Cranburn, and against lesser supporters of Charnock's mission, Sir John Friend and Peter Cook. In May Fenwick's and Montgomery's wives tempted him through intermediaries to flee to France, with insincere promises of pardon and an annuity. Porter kept government ministers informed, and got the intermediaries arrested at a rendezvous. To please unscrupulous whigs, he also privately revived the nonsensical popish plot charges against the duke of Leeds. While giving evidence against Fenwick in parliament that winter, Porter panicked when Sir John's supporters encouraged a false murder charge against him. In 1697 he was accused of rape.<br>
<br>Porter received a pardon, payment of &pound;1700 debts, a &pound;260 pension, and a &pound;60 rented house near Whitehall Privy Garden. Decent people shunned him, but Ailesbury's claim that Queen Anne cancelled his pension is untrue&#151;he received it until his death. On 31 December 1712, having evidently converted to Anglicanism, he married Elizabeth Jones (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1684) at St Martin-in-the-Fields. He died on 4 July 1728, and was buried at the same church two days later. His will left everything to his wife, cutting off his natural daughter Anne Fenn with a shilling and her son George with a 20<i>s</i>. ring. Ailesbury's phrase &#145;that monster of a man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.354), seems a fair moral summary.<br>
