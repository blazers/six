<span class="headword">Sherley <span class="st"> [Shirley]</span>, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1564&#150;1633/4), <span class="occ">privateer and travel writer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25435/', "Sir Thomas Sherley (c.1542&#150;1612)")</script> of Wiston, Sussex, and his wife, Anne Kempe (<i>c</i>.1542&#150;1623), daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe of Olantigh, Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25423/', "Sir Anthony Sherley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25433/', "Robert Shirley, Count Shirley")</script>, were his younger brothers. Together the three brothers through their exploits in Persia and the Mediterranean earned a reputation in their day in pamphlet and play as champions of Christendom against the Turk. To a more jaundiced twentieth-century eye &#145;The Sherleys all had unlimited bravura and glib sales talk, everything but a capacity to turn an honest penny&#146;  (Prestwich, 390).<br>
<br>Thomas Sherley matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1579, but left without graduating. In November 1581 he was admitted to the Inner Temple. In 1584 he was returned for the borough of Steyning, Sussex, for which he was to sit in three other parliaments (those of 1593, 1614, and 1621). In 1585 Thomas Sherley accompanied his brother Anthony and his father to the Low Countries, where he commanded a company of cavalry. In January 1588 he saw his only engagement. Encamped outside the walls of the city of Zwolle, Thomas's company was attacked late one evening after a day spent drinking. In the ensuing battle, only twenty horses and thirty men escaped slaughter at the hands of the Spanish. Despite the fact that Sherley's incompetence was largely to blame for this deadly fiasco, the privy council granted him an allowance to rebuild his company. Within two months Thomas had returned to England and his brother Anthony had taken command of the remnants of his company.<br>
<br>Sherley did not stay in England for long, for he entered service in Ireland where he was knighted by Lord Deputy William Fitzwilliam on 26 October 1589. Back in England, Sherley frequented the court, where he succumbed to the charms of a wealthy widow, Frances, Lady Stourton, the sister of Lord Cobham and sister-in-law of Robert Cecil. Although both families favoured the match, Sherley's gaze proved fickle as he met and secretly married Frances Vavasour, the daughter of Sir Thomas Vavasour, in the summer of 1591. But in order to avoid offending his father he still outwardly confessed his intentions towards Lady Stourton. However, in August 1591, while on progress with the court, the queen found out about the match and was furious. Sherley was sent to the Marshalsea prison where he remained until early 1592.<br>
<br>After serving in the parliament of 1593 Sherley later that year returned to the Low Countries as a captain. The increasingly acute financial difficulties of his family forced him to relinquish his command to his brother-in-law Thomas Vavasour. In 1598 he fitted out a fleet to cruise the seas in search of prizes. Spending the summer off the Portuguese coast, he succeeded in capturing four L&uuml;beck ships, and bringing them back to Portsmouth. Although the freight was Spanish the privy council determined that because the ships belonged to a friendly port, they must be returned. Sherley likely received no return on this venture. Undeterred, he set out again late in 1598 but bad weather damaged his ships and he lost one of his prizes. He was forced to borrow money on the security of his ship in order to get home. Nor did his luck improve, for early in 1599 he captured two more ships, the contents of which the privy council deemed the property of foreign merchants resident in London; Sherley was forced to transport them to the capital and restore anything lost.<br>
<br>Sherley's third privateering voyage was probably his most profitable, for in early 1600 he captured two rich prizes, one of which, a merchantman loaded in the West Indies, was deemed to be good. After this he seems to have contented himself in England for a short while. In the elections to the 1601 parliament his father took the seat in Steyning which the family controlled, but Thomas was returned as MP for both Bramber and Hastings, choosing to sit for the latter.<br>
<br>In March 1602 Sherley returned to the seas but decided to avoid the difficulties of privateering (or piracy) on the high seas, concentrating instead on raiding coastal areas. Ten days after leaving Southampton in May, however, he was forced back to port for want of victuals. Selling four of his ships to outfit his remaining two, he proceeded to cruise the Portuguese coast, sacking two small Portuguese hamlets. According to the letter-writer John Chamberlain, when Thomas returned he hurried to court as if he had succeeded in taking Seville.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1602 Sherley staked the balance of the credit he could raise from his estate on a final voyage, deciding to cruise the Mediterranean. Off Gibraltar, he took a Flemish ship but the prize proved to hold little. Over the following months his crew became mutinous and at least two of his fleet departed in the night. In February 1603 the remains of his force were driven by contrary winds to the island of K&eacute;a, the most north-westerly of the Cyclades Islands and Ottoman territory. Under cover of darkness Sherley and his force marched on the city, where he and two other Englishmen were captured. The rest of his crew fled, setting sail without making any attempt at rescue. Without their captain, they captured a rich Venetian galleon in late February 1603, severely complicating the precarious position of Thomas's brother Anthony in Venice where the senate was unaware that the fleet was acting independently.<br>
<br>A month after his capture Sherley was taken to Negroponte, and late in July he was moved to Constantinople. Initially his imprisonment was wretched, but in April 1604 some money arrived from his father and he was able to purchase a chamber. However, he remained captive until 6 December 1605, when, after a direct appeal from James I, he was released. The observations he made while returning to England in the spring of 1606 form the content of his &#145;Discours of the Turkes&#146;. Predictably the tone of this work befits that of one whose author had just been thirty-three months in captivity, for the first half is given over to an ethnography of the Turks which lapses into an especially virulent invective against Turkish vice and irreligion. Sherley also goes to some length to stress that a united effort by all the Christian princes of Europe might succeed in dislodging Ottoman power; this, he feels, would particularly benefit the English whose ships could be used to transport the invaders. The remainder of the work is unremarkable and details the author's passage back to England through Italy and Germany. Although not published until 1936 the pronounced similarity in its phrasing, especially in its section devoted to the origin of the Turks, suggests that Sherley's &#145;Discours&#146; was one of the sources used by Anthony Nixon for his <span class="italic">Three English Brothers</span> (1607), a work perhaps owing more to the genre of panegyric than to history. In turn Nixon's work formed the basis for a short and unremarkable play, more noted for its liveliness than its adherence to the dramatic unities, written by John Day and performed in the same year as Nixon's book was published, <span class="italic">The Travailes of the Three English Brothers</span>.<br>
<br>Back in England, Sherley was in gaol again by September 1607, probably for trying to interfere with the operations of the Levant Company. In August 1611 he was made a prisoner of the king's bench as an insolvent debtor. In the depths of despair he tried to poison himself in the summer of 1612. On his release he was elected to parliament for Steyning in 1614. Following the death of his first wife, Frances, at some point between 1610 and 1615, Sherley married for a second time on 2 December 1617. His new wife was a widow, Judith Taylor, the daughter of William Bennet of London, a woman whose reputation for promiscuity was a subject of gossip. With his first wife Sherley had four daughters and three sons (of whom one was the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25425/', "Henry Shirley")</script>, run through with a sword by Sir Edward Bishop in the course of a quarrel over debts in 1627); with his second he had a further five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>In 1622, shortly before his mother's death, Sherley sold Wiston to Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex, and retired to the Isle of Wight, where he lived at Cosham House, Newport, holding the position of keeper of the royal park. Still weighed down by debt, Sherley resorted to the charity of Sir John Oglander, a kinsman on his mother's side, who lent him money freely &#145;as his kinsman and friend&#146;, but with experience learnt wariness: &#145;yet I knew him to be so ill a paymaster that I was forced to make him honest by taking a pawn for my money&#146;  (Bamford, 238). According to Oglander's commonplace book Sherley died on the Isle of Wight in 1633 (on old-style dating, so between 25 March 1633 and 25 March 1634).<br>
