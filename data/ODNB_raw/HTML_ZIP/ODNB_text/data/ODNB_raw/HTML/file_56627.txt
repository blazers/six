<span class="headword">Deakin,  Joseph Thomas</span>  (1858&#150;1937), <span class="occ">railway worker and socialist</span>, was born at Wednesbury, Staffordshire, on 11 August 1858, the son of Charles Deakin, a blacksmith, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Middleton, the daughter of a labourer. He was educated at Old Park British School, Wednesbury. On leaving at the age of twelve to start work at Wednesbury goods station, he was awarded the South Staffordshire Coal and Ironmasters' Association prize of a family <span class="roman">Bible</span>. When he transferred to the ticket office at the passenger station in March 1890, his workmates presented him with copies of James Thorold Rogers's <span class="italic">Six Centuries of Work and Wages: the History of English Labour</span> (1884) and J. J. Jusserand's <span class="italic">English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages</span> (1889), &#145;in appreciation of his geniality and uniform kindness to all&#146;.<br>
<br>Deakin was an early convert to socialism and in 1887 he became a founder member of the Walsall Socialist Club. He was subsequently elected the club secretary and in this capacity attended the founding conference of the Second Socialist International in Paris in 1889 and its Brussels congress in 1891.<br>
<br>Shortly after returning from Brussels, Deakin became involved with three fellow members of the Socialist Club and two others in the so-called Walsall anarchist plot. This was, in fact, a police trap organized by Inspector William Melville of Scotland Yard. His agent, Auguste Coulon, who claimed anarchist connections in France and England, lured the six men into a bogus scheme to produce bomb making equipment for use in Russia. The six were arrested in January 1892 and following committal hearings in Walsall appeared at Stafford assizes on 30 March 1892, on charges under the <span class="roman">Explosive Substances Act</span> of 1883.<br>
<br>The trial was badly flawed. The judge, Mr Justice Hawkins, ruled that the defence could not question Inspector Melville, who was the chief prosecution witness, about his relationship with Coulon and he admitted as evidence a confession by Deakin, which had clearly been made under duress. Consequentially, four of the accused, including Deakin, were convicted. Three of them were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment but the jury recommended clemency for Deakin and he was given a reduced term of five years. He served most of his sentence in Parkhurst prison, where he acted as prison librarian. He earned maximum remission and was discharged on Christmas eve 1895.<br>
<br>On his release Deakin returned to his home, 238 Stafford Street, Walsall, which was a milliner's shop owned by two of his three sisters, Lucy and Elizabeth. His criminal record effectively made him unemployable so he acted as clerk to his sisters' business and supplemented the small income this provided by doing bookkeeping and similar work for friends.<br>
<br>Deakin's belief in socialism remained unshaken and he became the intellectual driving force behind the rise of the labour movement in Walsall. He never held, or even stood for, any office himself but provided those who did with an endless supply of ideas and information, as well as conducting a relentless propaganda campaign in the local press. His reputation as a socialist thinker and advocate soon spread far beyond Walsall and he received a constant stream of requests for advice from all over Britain and from abroad. He always provided a comprehensive answer, either from his own encyclopaedic knowledge or from his cherished book collection.<br>
<br>Deakin died at home on 7 September 1937 and was buried in Ryecroft cemetery three days later. He never married. His closest surviving relatives were his sisters, Lucy and Elizabeth, and a younger brother, Charles. In an obituary, the former Labour MP for Walsall, J. J. McShane, wrote that in all his experience in parliament and elsewhere he had &#145;never met another comparable with Joe Deakin, in range of knowledge, in ability, and in tenderness of feeling&#146;  (<span class="italic">Walsall Observer</span>, 11 Sept 1937).<br>
