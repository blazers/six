<span class="headword">Aitken,  Edith</span>  (1861&#150;1940), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born at Bishophill, Bishophill Junior, York, on 16 June 1861, the third child of Henry Martin Aitken, surgical instrument manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth Atkinson. She and her elder siblings were baptized at St Mary Minor, Bishophill, on 8 July 1861. Their father had advanced views on the education of girls, and the eldest daughter, Rose (1849&#150;1922), went to Girton College, then at Hitchin, in 1871, before becoming a schoolmistress. Edith was educated at Lendal House, and privately until her father's death in 1875. His wishes were respected and she was sent as a boarder, at the age of fourteen, to North London Collegiate School, under Miss Buss, and where her elder sister was already teaching classics.<br>
<br>In 1879 Aitken went to Girton College, Cambridge, where she read for the natural sciences tripos and achieved first-class honours in part one in 1882, later (1904) taking her MA from Trinity College, Dublin, as Cambridge degrees remained closed to women. She was eventually able to take her Cambridge MA in 1925. She began her teaching career at Manchester Girls' High School, then moved to Nottingham Girls' High School in 1883. She joined the staff of Notting Hill high school three years later and returned to North London Collegiate School as science mistress in 1892. From 1899 to 1902 she was lecturer in chemistry at Bedford College, London. Her <span class="italic">Elementary Textbook of Botany</span>, first published in 1891, went through three editions.<br>
<br>In 1902, immediately after the end of the South African War, Aitken went out to South Africa to take up a position as the first headmistress of Pretoria High School for Girls, following in the footsteps of Ellen Constance Steedman, a fellow Girtonian scientist of her year, who became headmistress of Eunice High School, Bloemfontein, in 1901. Miss Aitken inherited the buildings of a school which had closed in 1899, but little else. She was well suited to the challenge. Although she modelled the new school on the North London Collegiate, even to the point of giving it the same motto (&#145;We work in hope&#146;), she was alert to the need for adaptation in South Africa. She herself qualified to teach Dutch and was adamant that both English- and Dutch-speaking pupils should be taught and received on the same footing, and appointed Dutch speakers as well as English. The school opened in 1902 with 106 pupils; in 1904 there were 167 on the roll, and by December 1908 the old buildings were too small for the 194 pupils, of whom 60 were boarders. From then on &#145;EA&#146;, as she was affectionately known, continually badgered the director of education for new premises further out of town. As a result, the school moved to its new buildings in 1915, though it took Miss Aitken another two years of persistence before she acquired adjacent playing fields. When she retired in 1923, the school had long been known as the best of its kind in South Africa. She last visited it in 1938, when she had the satisfaction of seeing how it thrived in every way. Not least, she was able to see how the pines and jacarandas she had planted stood high around the buildings.<br>
<br>Aitken's interests were wide. As well as enjoying riding, sport, music, and drama, her enthusiasm for art was a great bond with her brother Charles Aitken (1869&#150;1936), director of the Tate collection. She was deeply saddened by his death, which left her isolated. After retiring to England she lived in a London flat, but later moved to Abbot's Holt, Tilford, Surrey. She died suddenly at the Grange Nursing Home, Wrecclesham, Farnham, Surrey, on 2 November 1940, after suffering a coronary thrombosis.<br>
