<span class="headword">Abel,  Robert <span class="st"> [Bobby]</span></span>  (1857&#150;1936), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at 18 Commercial Street, Rotherhithe, London, on 30 November 1857, the son of Thomas Abel (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1815), a lamplighter, and his wife, Elizabeth Highland (<i>b</i>. 1816). After attending school in Southwark and playing cricket for Southwark Park, he began his illustrious career as a professional cricketer at the Oval. He played 514 matches for Surrey, but it was a slow beginning. He was twenty-three before making his d&eacute;but in 1881, and it was 1886 before he was firmly established in the Surrey side. Thereafter he became one of England's most productive batsmen. An opening bat of phlegmatic certainty, his compact efficiency was such that in eight successive summers (1895&#150;1902) he exceeded 2000 runs, including the then first-class record of 3309 in 1901. This dauntless consistency eventually earned him the grand total of 33,124 first-class runs, at an average of 35.46 and with seventy-four centuries. His best innings was 357 not out, for Surrey against Somerset at the Oval in 1899, at that time the second highest score in county championship cricket. In the same year he shared a stand of 447 with Tom Hayward for Surrey against Yorkshire at the Oval, which stood as a world fourth-wicket record until 1943&#150;4. Rightly regarded as a most adept slip fielder, he took no fewer than 586 catches.<br>
<br>Abel played thirteen times for England between 1888 and 1902, and, along with four other professionals, he was involved in the abortive claim for extra money for the Oval test of 1896. However, in an era of mercurial amateur &#145;cracks&#146;, he never became an international star. Rather was it his pleasant fate to be the most popular Surrey &#145;pro&#146; when that county played successfully to crowded houses. His sobriquets&#151;the &#145;Cock Sparrow&#146;, the &#145;Mighty Atom&#146;, the &#145;Little 'Un&#146;, and, indisputably the most quoted, the &#145;Guv'nor&#146;&#151;bear testimony to that renown. Bobby Abel was the classic case of the little man triumphing over larger foes and thereby deserving the plaudits of the ordinary onlooker. He waddled with duck-like gait to open the innings, a curiously gnomic figure who could not have been more unlike, in stature and style, the magnificent ones of that golden age. Less than 5 feet 8 inches in height, &#145;he has&#146;, wrote C. B. Fry, &#145;a curious manner of standing at the wicket (wrapping, as it were, his left leg round the front of his right)&#146;  (Lemmon, 76&#150;7), from which strange position he then carefully demonstrated what H. S. Altham called &#145;that inexhaustible talent for run-making&#146;  (Altham, 174). It seems somehow fitting that, down the road from the Oval in 1889, when Bobby Abel was reaching his peak, Charlie Chaplin, personification of the sorely tried little fellow and masterly exponent of the ten-to-three shuffle, was born.<br>
<br>An eye infection which, in 1893, had briefly threatened to end Abel's career, recurred in the early 1900s, and, although glasses helped a little, he had to give up the game. He played his last first-class match in 1904, and, like many professional cricketers, became involved in sports shops and in coaching. Married to Sarah Reffell (1861&#150;1923) at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 31 January 1881, Abel was as prodigious in domestic as in professional life, fathering no fewer than eleven children. Two, Thomas Ernest and William John, played first-class cricket. Abel died at his home, 43 Handforth Road, Stockwell, London, on 10 December 1936.<br>
