<span class="headword">Boyle,  John</span>, fifth earl of Cork and fifth earl of Orrery  (1707&#150;1762), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born in Glasshouse Street, London, on 2 January 1707. He was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3124/', "Charles Boyle, fourth earl of Orrery (1674&#150;1731)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Cecil (<i>c</i>.1687&#150;1708), daughter of the fifth earl of Exeter. He never knew his mother and saw little of his father, a soldier and diplomat. He was educated at home, being tutored from 1713 by the poet Elijah Fenton, his father's secretary, and from November 1717 at Westminster School. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 16 August 1723, and two years later, now styled Lord Boyle, left Oxford without a degree and departed for a continental tour, ostensibly to complete his education but also disguising his father's Jacobite mission.<br>
<br>On 9 May 1728, soon after coming of age, Boyle married, in London, Lady Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1732), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12069/', "George Hamilton, first earl of Orkney")</script>. As Henrietta's parents strictly forbade her association with her father-in-law and his mistress Margaret Swordfeger (<i>d</i>. 1741) the already uneasy relationship between Lord Boyle and his father grew worse. The fourth earl not only made generous provision in his will for Mrs Swordfeger and their children but, unjustly declaring that his legitimate son had never demonstrated &#145;Inclination either for the Entertainment or Knowledge which Study and Learning afford&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/646/341&#150;342), he bequeathed most of his immense personal library to Christ Church. Struggling between filial deference and devotion to his wife Lord Boyle lamented: &#145;I lost my Mother before I knew I had one; I have a Father but he seems not to know he has a Son&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orrery Papers</span>, 1.83). There was a reconciliation in 1730, but the fourth earl died on 28 August 1731, with his will unamended.<br>
<br>Profound personal tragedy struck the new earl of Orrery again, on 22 August 1732, with the death of Henrietta on the couple's arrival in Ireland. Orrery was left with three small children: Charles (<i>b</i>. 27 Jan 1729), Hamilton (<i>b</i>. 3 Feb 1730), and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 7 May 1731). Compounding his grief was his financial predicament; he had assumed his father's debts of over &pound;20,000 but, owing to negligence and the dishonesty of his father's agent, his Irish estates were far less profitable than had been expected. For eighteen years he pursued lawsuits, attempting to regain sums due.<br>
<br>On 30 June 1738, in Dublin, Orrery married Margaret Hamilton (1710&#150;1758), of Caledon, co. Tyrone, with a fortune of about &pound;3000 p.a.; shortly after the marriage she pledged her diamonds as security for her husband's debts. The pair enjoyed domesticity, and, unlike his own father, Orrery deeply cherished time spent with his growing family. He and Margaret had three children: Lucy, Catherine, and Edmund (<i>b</i>. 21 Nov 1742). At Oxford in 1743 he was created MA (University College) and DCL. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 7 November 1735 but he shunned public affairs wherever possible, preferring instead the rural tranquillity of his estate at Marston, Somerset, or his wife's house at Caledon.<br>
<br>Orrery began his political career as a tory and Jacobite. In parliament he associated with Bolingbroke, and attacked the ministry in 1739; he also communicated with the exiled Stuart court and involved himself in Jacobite schemes before the rising of 1745. He joined signatories who asked Louis XV to dispatch 10,000 troops and was designated a member of the council of regents for Prince Charles Edward in 1743. A Jacobite prisoner disclosed his name to a Lords committee in 1746 but it decided against his prosecution. He was reportedly still toasting James Stuart publicly as late as 1747 but he was also turning towards the opposition court of Frederick, prince of Wales. By 1749 he was listed as a potential office-holder on Frederick's accession, but Frederick died in 1751 and soon afterwards Orrery withdrew from politics. His finances were so hopelessly confused that he was obliged to place his estates in the hands of trustees for the benefit of his many creditors and, in September 1754, to retire with his wife and daughter Lucy to live more economically in Italy. He became acquainted with Horace Mann, the British consul in Florence, whom he convinced of his loyalty to George II; on his return to England in late 1755 he began to receive a secret service pension of &pound;800 p.a. that continued until his death.<br>
<br>Orrery was on intimate terms with Alexander Pope from the early 1730s until the latter's death; his acquaintance with Swift began in 1732, during the dean's waning years. His correspondence with both figures suggests deep friendship and an undying mutual respect; he was instrumental in the publication of their letters and other works. His own best-known work is his popular and controversial <span class="italic">Remarks on the Life and Writings of Dr. Jonathan Swift</span> (1751), in the form of a series of letters to his son Hamilton. Though <span class="italic">Remarks</span> elicited hostile contemporary criticism modern studies applaud Orrery's reasoned objectivity, his creative innovation in utilizing the epistolary method in biography, and his judicious consultation of reliable, first-hand sources, which compensated for his limited acquaintance with Swift.<br>
<br>Orrery's other works include translations of two of Horace's odes (1741); a translation of Pliny's letters (1751), dedicated to his son Charles (which was overshadowed by a more academic edition in the same year); and <span class="italic">Letters from Italy in the Years 1754 and 1755</span>, published posthumously in 1773, which is filled with perceptive social and cultural observations. He also contributed anonymous essays to periodicals, but arguably his greatest literary contribution is as a letter-writer. A two-volume selection from letters now at Harvard, edited by Emily Boyle, countess of Cork and Orrery, (<span class="italic">The Orrery Papers</span>, 1903), poignantly unveils a complicated, hypersensitive individual; an affectionate, attentive father and passionate, devoted husband; and a conscientious landlord of Irish estates whose pungent commentaries about the backward, unsophisticated country around him are both hilarious and informative. Orrery's letters display a man striving for literary recognition, not solely because of his family's historical legacy; his unpleasant youthful memories; and the fact that his leisure and innate abilities lent facility to such endeavours. Orrery encouraged other authors, including Fenton, Thomas Southerne, Elizabeth Rowe, Mary Barber, Samuel Bowden, Lewis Theobald, and Charlotte Lennox; Johnson said that had he &#145;been rich, he would have been a very liberal patron&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 5.238).<br>
<br>Lady Orrery died in London on 24 November 1758, followed by her elder stepson, Charles, on 16 September 1759. Orrery lived on until 16 November 1762, when, at Marston, complications from his long-time affliction with gout ended his life; he was buried at St John's, Frome. Contrary to common misconceptions his lands had not been augmented by the Cork estates of his cousin Richard, earl of Cork and Burlington, upon the latter's death in 1753; all Orrery received was the Cork title.<br>
<br>Johnson called Orrery &#145;feeble-minded&#146; and said that his conversation &#145;was like his writings, neat and elegant, but without strength. He grasped at more than his abilities could reach; tried to pass for a better talker, a better writer, and a better thinker, than he was&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 5.238). Yet Lady Mary Wortley Montagu remarked in 1754 that despite the inherent flaws in Orrery's <span class="italic">Remarks</span>, it clearly established its author as &#145;a Poet, a Patriot, a Philosopher, a Physician, a Critic, a compleat Scholar, and a most excellent Moralist, shining in private Life as a submissive Son, a tender Father, and zealous Friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Letters</span>, 3.56). If her usually acerbic criticism is not the sole motivation for her comments, a re-examination of the man and his writings lends it credence.<br>
