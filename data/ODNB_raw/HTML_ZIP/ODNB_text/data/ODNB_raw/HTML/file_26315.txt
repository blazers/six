<span class="headword">Starkey <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Stirk]</span>,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Eirenaeus Philalethes]</span>  (1628&#150;1665), <span class="occ">alchemist, medical practitioner, and writer</span>, was born George Stirk on 8 or 9 June 1628 in Bermuda, the first child of George Stirk or Stirke (<i>c</i>.1595&#150;1637), a Scottish minister of Calvinist persuasions who had settled there in 1622, and Elizabeth Painter. In or before 1650 he changed his name to Starkey. He had at least four siblings: Sibill or Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1629), Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1632), Agnes (<i>bap</i>. 1633), and Samuel (<i>bap</i>. 1635). Before 20 May 1650 he married Susanna Stoughton (<i>d</i>. 1662), the daughter of the prominent <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26605/', "Colonel Israel Stoughton")</script> of Dorchester, Massachusetts, and the sister of William Stoughton, future governor of Massachusetts. Their marriage seems to have been childless.<h2>
<a name="Helmontianscience"></a>Helmontian science</h2>Early in life Starkey displayed some interest in natural history, for his entomological observations of Bermudan mayflies, silk-spiders, and horse flies were later collected by his English colleagues. He left Bermuda some time after his father's death in 1637 and in 1643 entered Harvard College, where he was tutored by college president Henry Dunster; he graduated AB in 1646 and AM about 1649. He was introduced to alchemical theory as part of the Harvard curriculum, and, accompanied by his classmate John Alcocke (<i>d</i>. 1667), soon took up its practical application under the guidance of Richard Palgrave (<i>d</i>. 1651), a physician of Charlestown. Starkey established a close friendship with Dr Robert Child (1613&#150;1654), an important member of the Hartlib circle, and was in close contact with the younger John Winthrop, who lent him laboratory apparatus and reagents.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1650 Starkey emigrated to England, despite having set up a profitable medical practice in the Boston area. On his arrival in London he joined the loose circle of friends and correspondents of Samuel Hartlib, who were interested in scientific, economic, and educational reform. Lodging at first in Hosier Lane, he soon moved in with one Webbe, an associate of Hartlib, probably to be identified with the brewer and chemist Francis Webbe. He met Hartlib's friend John Durie and his wife, and appears to have undertaken, in 1652, the manufacture of perfumes with Durie at St James's Palace, where Durie was library keeper. He also seems to have lived there for a time.<br>
<br>The Hartlib circle was a major centre for interest in chemical technology of all sorts, but above all in the works of J. B. Van Helmont. Robert Boyle was a member of the group and he promoted Starkey's ventures in the areas of metallic transmutation and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals&#151;particularly those which followed Van Helmont. The two men collaborated on the production of a drug called <i>ens veneris</i>, a copper compound of Helmontian provenance, during the early 1650s. At the same time Boyle took a keen interest in Starkey's &#145;sophic mercury&#146; (to be identified with Boyle's &#145;incalescent mercury&#146; described in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of 1675). The sophic mercury, made from an amalgam of antimony, silver, and mercury, is described in a letter written by Starkey to Boyle in 1651 (part of this letter, called the <span class="italic">Clavis</span>, was later transcribed by Isaac Newton). The sophic mercury dissolved gold and underwent metallic &#145;vegetation&#146;&#151;the formation of dendritic crystals&#151;when heated in a sealed container with the precious metal. The end result of this slow heating was supposed to be the production of the philosopher's stone, an agent for transmuting base metals into noble ones.<br>
<br>Although Starkey's sophic mercury was sufficiently remarkable to impress Boyle, and later to interest John Locke and Isaac Newton, it appears that his excessive claims led him into serious debt. Thus Hartlib wrote to Boyle in February 1654 that Starkey had been imprisoned as a debtor, that he had fled to Rotherhithe, and that he was &#145;altogether degenerated&#146;. Starkey's financial situation never recovered its former level, and his reputation with Hartlib sank accordingly.<br>
<br>After his release from prison Starkey lived in Bristol from about April 1655 to April 1656. At the urging of one Dux Watson, he worked as a refiner of unspecified ores there, perhaps also practising medicine. On his return to London he published two Helmontian treatises, <span class="italic">Natures Explication and Helmont's Vindication</span> (1657), dedicated to the regicide mayor of London, Robert Tichborne, and <span class="italic">Pyrotechny Asserted and Illustrated</span> (1658). At the time of writing <span class="italic">Pyrotechny</span> he was lodging at the White Swan in Foster Lane. <span class="italic">Natures Explication</span> adopts a strikingly invective tone, and in the book Starkey challenges the &#145;Galenical tribe&#146;&#151;mainly the orthodox members of the College of Physicians&#151;to a sort of duel. Rejecting their humoral medicine and its purgative therapies, Starkey suggests that a sample of clinical patients be divided up into respective groups of ten, to be treated either by himself or his opponent. The opponent must pay Starkey an unspecified amount for each patient cured by Helmontian means, while Starkey will pay twice that amount for each one brought to health by Galenical methods. This uncompromising assault on the College of Physicians brought unspecified retributions, and may have contributed to a damaging lawsuit by William Currer, another medical practitioner. None the less, <span class="italic">Natures Explication</span> and <span class="italic">Pyrotechny</span> were fairly popular even into the eighteenth century, having been translated into French, Dutch, and German. Starkey's Helmontian diatribes were even read by the young J. W. von Goethe, who says in his <span class="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit</span> that he perused one or more of these medical texts while suffering from a chronic illness during his student years.<h2>
<a name="EirenaeusPhilalethes"></a>Eirenaeus Philalethes</h2>Although these books were fairly successful, Starkey's real fame sprang from a series of manuscripts circulated initially within the Hartlib circle. These texts, written under pseudonyms such as Eirenaeus Philalethes (&#145;a peaceful lover of truth&#146;), Eirenaeus Philoponos Philalethes, Anonymus Philalethes, Agricola Rhomaeus, and Philosophus Americanus, contain elaborately veiled recipes for the sophic mercury described openly in Starkey's <span class="italic">Clavis</span>. The most famous of the Philalethan works, the <span class="italic">Introitus apertus ad occlusum regis palatium</span> (published in 1667), was written between 1651 and 1654, at the height of Starkey's Hartlibian association. The <span class="italic">Introitus</span> was calculated to arouse interest among Hartlib and his group, and contains numerous allusions to their chiliastic and reformatory goals. About the same time Starkey produced his <span class="italic">De metallorum metamorphosi, Brevis manuductio ad rubinum coelestem</span>, and <span class="italic">Fons chemicae philosophiae</span> (published as <span class="italic">Tres tractatus</span> in 1669), and a number of commentaries on the fifteenth-century alchemist George Ripley, which were published in 1678 as <span class="italic">Ripley Reviv'd</span>. All of these works, along with the verse <span class="italic">Marrow of Alchemy</span> (1654&#150;5), were attributed to Philalethes.<br>
<br>Starkey spread the rumour that Philalethes was a young friend of his, still living in America, who had discovered the philosopher's stone. (A biography of this Philalethes was included in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> together with that of Starkey.) Because it was widely believed that the philosopher's stone could cure disease as well as transmute base metals, Philalethes was said to have rejuvenated a withered peach tree and restored an elderly woman's hair and teeth. When Philalethes' works were published, mostly after Starkey's own death, they met with huge success. The <span class="italic">Introitus apertus</span> went through at least nine Latin editions, and appeared in English, French, German, and Spanish as well. Philalethes' <span class="italic">Opera omnia</span> were collected, and published in the unlikely setting of Modena in 1695. Isaac Newton, now known to have written over a million words on alchemy, numbered Philalethes among his favourite authors. There is good reason to believe that Newton's theories about the corpuscular microstructure of matter and the chemical affinities operating among those corpuscles owe a significant debt to Starkey's Philalethan writings. Newton's arch-rival Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, another devoted student of alchemy, also read Philalethes, and Georg Ernst Stahl, founder of the phlogiston theory of combustion, had a profound knowledge of Philalethes' alchemical writings. Though Stahl ardently opposed dissembling alchemists, he did not deny the possibility of metallic transmutation, and praised Philalethes highly in his own <span class="italic">Philosophical Principles of Universal Chemistry</span> (1730) as &#145;that candid and ingenuous author&#146;.<br>
<br>Despite the immense popularity of Philalethes' works, few readers suspected that Starkey was the real man behind the mask. Only the most recent scholarship has definitely proved that he and Philalethes were one. In the late seventeenth century it was widely believed that the &#145;American philosopher&#146; was still living in the New World, long after Starkey's demise in the London plague of 1665. Ironically, the success that Starkey sought was visited more lavishly on his literary creation than on himself. Indeed, subsequent commentators on Philalethes often portrayed Starkey in unflattering terms as a drunken and dishonest rogue who schemed to extract his master's secrets.<h2>
<a name="Pamphletwarsanddeath"></a>Pamphlet wars and death</h2>Starkey's undesirable reputation was surely bolstered by the pamphleteering activities in which he engaged during and after the Restoration. Despite the fact that <span class="italic">Natures Explication</span> was dedicated to Tichborne, Starkey wrote three pro-monarchy treatises in 1660, <span class="italic">The Dignity of Kingship Asserted</span>, <span class="italic">Britains Triumph</span>, and <span class="italic">Royal and other Innocent Bloud Crying Aloud to Heaven for due Vengeance</span>. These earned him the reputation of being a trimmer, although his conciliatory position towards Charles II was not inconsistent with the mood of other Presbyterians. <span class="italic">The Dignity of Kingship Asserted</span> in fact contains a defence of Presbyterianism, and suggests an alliance between Anglicans and Presbyterians in favour of the Restoration. At this time Starkey was dwelling in St Thomas Apostles &#145;next door to Black-lyon-Court&#146;.<br>
<br>The same year saw the beginning of Starkey's embroilment in a number of pamphlet wars with other medical practitioners. One Richard Matthew or Mathew had in 1655 acquired secret recipes for &#145;Starkey's pill&#146;, a compound employing salt of tartar to detoxify opium. In 1660 Matthew marketed the pill as his own in a book entitled <span class="italic">The Unlearned Alchymist his Antidote</span>. Following Matthew's sudden death, subsequent editions of this work and advertising broadsheets were brought out by Anne Matthew, his widow. In response Starkey published complaints against the Matthew concern in his <span class="italic">The Admirable Efficacy and Almost Incredible Virtue of True Oyl, which is Made of Sulphur-vive</span> (1660), and <span class="italic">George Starkey's Pill Vindicated</span> (undated). The success of Matthew's pill continued unabated. Starkey, meanwhile, entered a period during which he frequently moved&#151;five times in the period from January 1663 to June 1664 (from Fleet-yard to an uncertain address, then to Blackfriars, back to St Thomas Apostles, and finally to Bartholomew Lane and Broadstreet). It is likely that he was fleeing his creditors and possibly persecution from the medical authorities.<br>
<br>A more bitter exchange soon took place between Starkey and Lionel Lockyer (<i>d</i>. 1672), a chymical empiric who had great success marketing a &#145;Pill Extracted from the Rays of the Sun&#146; (an antimony compound). Feeling threatened by the encroachment of unlettered practitioners such as Lockyer on his market niche, Starkey denounced the antimonial pill in a <span class="italic">Brief Examination and Censure</span> published in 1664. This was met with a sharp reply by one &#145;G. S.&#146;, accusing Starkey of gross improprieties. Starkey rebutted this attack in <span class="italic">A Smart Scourge for a Silly, Sawcy Fool</span> (1664), which was met by a counter-attack attributed to &#145;Philo-Chemicus&#146;, and called <span class="italic">Aut Helmont aut asinus</span>. Philo-Chemicus alleges, probably correctly, that Starkey had furnished himself with a spurious medical degree, and that he was a heavy drinker.<br>
<br>Starkey's dedication to drink, which is corroborated by his own &#145;A perfect day booke&#146; or diary, was believed by his contemporaries to have contributed in a surprising fashion to his death. When the great plague began in London in the spring of 1665, most of the established medical profession fled. The buildings housing the College of Physicians at Amen Corner were abandoned, and sacked by thieves. The chymical physicians of London, however, viewed this dereliction as an opportunity to show the superiority of their Helmontian plague remedies to the ineffectual medicines of the Galenists. Under the leadership of Thomas O'Dowde, a courtier and author of <span class="italic">The Poor Man's Physician</span> (1665), an attempt had already been started to establish a <a target="_top" href="/view/theme/107538">Society of Chemical Physicians</a> as an iatrochemical counterpart to the college. With the support of the duke of Buckingham and the archbishop of Canterbury, O'Dowde made a petition for letters patent. Among the signatories were such Helmontians as George Thomson, Jeremiah Astell, and George Starkey, all of whom remained in London during the epidemic. Starkey and other followers of Van Helmont believed they had discovered an effective therapy, the use of a preparation called <i>xenexton</i>, consisting principally of a dried toad (sometimes pulverized) hung about the neck. The toad corpse supposedly emitted plague-attacking atoms that penetrated the body of the patient. Starkey's friend Thomson relates in his <span class="italic">Loimotomia</span> (1666) that the New Englander tried to cure himself when he realized that he was infected with plague, but found that his prior consumption of an inordinate quantity of small beer had caused his pores to contract, rendering the <i>xenexton</i> incapable of penetrating his skin. He died that very night, in the late summer of 1665, probably in penury.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificance"></a>Historical significance</h2>Starkey's historical significance has been little appreciated until recently, in part because of his use of pseudonyms, and in part because his major area of interest, alchemy, was long vilified by historians of science. Despite his nineteenth-century reputation as a minor quack or charlatan, he was the first English-speaking native of the New World to be widely read on the European continent, and became the most famous scientific figure of Anglophone America until Benjamin Franklin. His colourful cures and the flamboyance of his fictive adept, Eirenaeus Philalethes, have done much to obscure the genuine significance of his work, yet it is clear that his writings were an important vehicle for spreading the influential doctrine that chemical phenomena can be explained as the interaction of insensible particles accompanied by powers or forces.<br>
<br>Starkey's various foibles were common to the times. The use of seemingly bizarre medicines was widespread in the seventeenth century, as was the use of pseudonyms, especially among alchemists. What is unusual about Starkey is the wide dispersion of his works and their influence even into the eighteenth century. His example throws serious doubt on the widespread belief that New England's intellectual attainments in the seventeenth century were of a strictly parochial character.<br>
