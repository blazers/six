<span class="headword">Petroc</span> <span class="st"> [St Petroc, Pedrog]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>6th cent.), <span class="occ">monk</span>, was the founder of the church of Padstow and patron saint of Bodmin, Cornwall. His earliest life was probably written in Cornwall in the eleventh century; it survives in the <span class="roman">Obituary</span> of St M&eacute;en, Brittany  (Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 9889). A number of texts concerning St Petroc, including a twelfth-century life partly derived from the St M&eacute;en life but containing much independent material, are preserved in the fourteenth-century Gotha manuscript compilation of British hagiographies, and an abridgement of the St M&eacute;en text was included by John Tynemouth in his fourteenth-century collection of lives of British saints (rearranged in <span class="italic">Nova legenda Anglie</span>). Petroc is also mentioned in several Welsh manuscripts of saints' lives and genealogies.<br>
<br>Unfortunately all these materials are legendary in character. They make Petroc a Welshman, son of King Glywys of Glamorgan (according to one genealogy, an uncle of St Cadog), or alternatively a son of a prince of Cornwall. The lives relate how he gave up his inheritance to become a monk, travelled to Ireland, Cornwall, Rome, the Holy Land, and India, and finally returned to Cornwall and led a life of ever-increasing solitude, abstinence, and miraculous power until his death at Treravel, near Padstow (commemorated on 4 June). An episode in which he visited a mysterious island in a glass boat recalls early Irish legend.<br>
<br>Historically, the most interesting details concern Petroc's relations with two other Cornish holy men, Wethenoc and Guron, who departed from their hermitages at Padstow and Bodmin to make way for him; this may reflect the takeover of independent monasteries by Petroc's expanding church after his death rather than events during his lifetime. The earliest centre of his cult, where he was buried, was Padstow, the site of his first landing in Cornwall. His relics had been transferred to Bodmin by the late eleventh century. In 1177, according to a vivid narrative in the Gotha manuscript, they were stolen by a Bodmin canon and taken to St M&eacute;en, Brittany, whence they were restored by the intervention of Henry II. They disappeared at the Reformation but the ivory casket in which they had been kept was rediscovered in the nineteenth century and is now in Bodmin church.<br>
<br>The wealth and importance of Bodmin church, and Petroc's status as co-patron of the diocese of Cornwall, caused his cult to spread more widely than those of most Cornish saints. He was the patron of many churches in south-west England, south Wales, and Brittany; already in the eleventh century his name was invoked in the litanies of Exeter and perhaps of Winchester and Salisbury, and in the middle ages his feast day was widely celebrated, eventually entering the Sarum calendar.<br>
