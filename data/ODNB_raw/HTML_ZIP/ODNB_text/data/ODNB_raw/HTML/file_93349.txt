<span class="headword">Wickham,  Glynne William Gladstone</span>  (1922&#150;2004), <span class="occ">drama scholar</span>, was born in Cape Town, South Africa, on 15 May 1922, the son of William Gladstone Wickham (<i>b</i>. 1877), British trade commissioner in South Africa, and his wife, Catherine. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36887/', "Edward Charles Wickham (1834&#150;1910)")</script>, dean of Lincoln, and his wife, Agnes (1842&#150;1932), eldest daughter of the prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. He retained his dual nationality until he returned his South African passport following the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, but he grew up mainly in England. As a child he showed a flair for drama, producing plays at the Gladstone family home at Hawarden, and at school at Winchester College, though his youthful ambitions were thwarted when the Dunkirk evacuation put an end to his plans to hire a theatre in Regent Street for his production of <span class="italic">1066 and All That</span>. His education continued at New College, Oxford, where in 1941 he played Hamlet for the Oxford University Dramatic Society under Nevill Coghill's direction. His studies were interrupted in 1942 when he was called up, and he served more than three years in the RAF. Having completed a tour of operations as a navigator in 9 squadron, Bomber Command, he was posted to Scotland to train French navigators&#151;solely, in his own account, on the strength of his school certificate French.<br>
<br>Discharged as a flight lieutenant in 1946, Wickham returned to Oxford, graduated BA in 1947, and began his doctoral research into medieval and early modern drama. He had in 1946&#150;7 been the first post-war president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, and Coghill, who devised a masque to celebrate the visit of the then Princess Elizabeth to Oxford in 1948, chose Wickham to direct it. This combination of scholarship and practice was a distinctive feature of his approach to drama, and one that influenced the development of it as an academic discipline. In the same year he was faced with a dilemma: whether to pursue the opportunity of a professional theatre career, or take up the offer of an assistant lectureship in the fledgeling department of drama, the first in the country, that was being created at the University of Bristol by its innovative vice-chancellor Sir Philip Morris. He chose Bristol, where over the next few years he secured the future of the new department. He nevertheless continued his doctoral research, and was made an Oxford DPhil in 1952.<br>
<br>Wickham was aware from the start that two resources in particular would be essential if the department was to flourish: a performing space in which to conduct theatrical experiments (he frequently likened drama to a laboratory subject) and a dedicated research library. The first aim was achieved when funding was provided by the American Rockefeller Foundation to create the first flexible studio theatre space in the UK, located in a former squash court, the second in 1951 when he persuaded Morris to provide &pound;50 with which he purchased William Etty's portrait of Charles Kean as King Lear. This was the foundation stone of a theatre collection dedicated to illustrative material that subsequently became the largest theatre archive in the UK apart from the London Theatre Museum.<br>
<br>Also in 1951 Wickham convened a symposium at Bristol on &#145;the responsibility of universities to the theatre&#146; at which he enlisted the support of a range of influential academics and practitioners to support the study of drama in the context of theatre. He soon moved to extend theatre to include radio drama&#151;he met his future wife, Marjorie Heseltine (Hesel) Mudford, daughter of William Mudford, journalist and army officer, while attending a BBC training course in 1953. A further symposium in 1954 on &#145;the relationship between universities and radio, film and television&#146; led to the introduction of film and, later, television studies. He and Hesel Mudford married on 1 May 1954. They had two sons, Stephen and Nicholas, and a daughter, Catherine.<br>
<br>Wickham travelled extensively in Europe, laying the ground for departmental tours of its productions to places such as Bayreuth, Vienna, and Parma, and in 1953, with a Rockefeller award, he travelled to the USA, which had long preceded the UK in having drama as a university subject. He maintained close links with the USA as with continental Europe, and was later appointed as a visiting professor at a number of American universities including Iowa, Yale, and Notre Dame. He was also committed to forging links between university drama and the professional theatre, establishing connections with the Bristol Old Vic and the Theatre School. He wanted to encourage new writers, and both Harold Pinter (<span class="italic">The Room</span>, 1957) and John Arden (<span class="italic">The Happy Haven</span>, 1958) had their first plays performed in the department's studio theatre.<br>
<br>Wickham's academic career moved forward with impressive speed. In 1955 he became head of department and, in 1960, the university's&#151;and therefore the UK's&#151;first professor of drama. His inaugural lecture was published in 1962 as <span class="italic">Drama in a World of Science</span>. Having established the discipline's academic respectability he took the opportunity for a broader look at the future of the department and the subject, and to express what he found exciting about drama as an academic subject: its capacity to connect with so many other disciplines (not just in the arts and humanities), its potential to embrace Western and Eastern traditions, and the fact that it had to be pursued through both study and practice&#151;what he described as &#145;the hands reunited with the heart and with the head&#146;.<br>
<br>Wickham published widely and influentially, ready always to make startling connections and to draw on his own practical investigation to enrich his critical and historical writing. His greatest achievement, and one that stemmed from his doctoral research, was his magisterial study <span class="italic">Early English Stages</span>, which appeared in five volumes between 1952 and 2002 and transformed the study of medieval and early modern theatre. In 1959 he initiated <span class="italic">New Theatre Magazine</span>, published by the department of drama until 1973; his other publications included <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Dramatic Heritage</span> (1969), <span class="italic">English Moral Interludes</span> (1975), much of its content drawn from his own production experience, and <span class="italic">A History of the Theatre</span> (1985). He also served as chairman of the Bristol-based editorial board of the Cambridge multi-volume <span class="italic">Theatre in Europe: a Documentary History</span>, with <span class="italic">English Professional Theatre, 1530&#150;1660</span> appearing under his own editorship in 2001.<br>
<br>Wickham's interests outside the department were extensive. He was president of the Society for Theatre Research from 1976 to 1999 and in 1970 he was asked by Sam Wanamaker to advise on the project to reconstruct a replica of the Elizabethan Globe Playhouse on London's South Bank. His contribution to the project was recognized when he received the Sam Wanamaker award for 1999. Between 1979 and 1983 he was the chairman and chief executive of Radio West. In 1982, on his retirement, the drama department's Vandyck Theatre was renamed the Wickham Theatre, the handsome blue plaque in the foyer paying tribute to &#145;Glynne Wickham, who inspired the study of drama in British universities&#146;. In 1996 he was made an honorary fellow of the University of Bristol, the university's highest honour. An event to commemorate and celebrate his life and work was held in the university's department of drama on 23 May 2004. He died at his home, 6 College Road, Clifton, Bristol, on 27 January 2004. He was survived by his wife, Hesel, and their three children. <br>
