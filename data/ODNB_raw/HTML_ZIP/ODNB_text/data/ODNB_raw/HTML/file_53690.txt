<span class="headword">Hope,  Louisa Octavia Augusta</span>  (1814&#150;1893), <span class="occ">promoter of household science teaching</span>, was the youngest of the twelve children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13717/', "Charles Hope, Lord Granton (1763&#150;1851)")</script>, the tory politician and lord president of the court of session, and of his wife (and cousin), Lady Charlotte Hope (1771&#150;1834), second daughter of John, second earl of Hopetoun. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13733/', "John Hope (1794&#150;1858)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72752/', "James Hope")</script> were her elder brothers. Most of Louisa's childhood seems to have been spent at the family home at Granton, north of Edinburgh, where she was educated mainly by her oldest sister. Like six of her seven sisters, Louisa remained unmarried.<br>
<br>Louisa Hope was an evangelical who, during the Disruption crisis, shared her family's prominent commitment to the Church of Scotland. The church subsequently became the vehicle through which she advanced many of her educational ideas. In the 1840s she ran evening classes for &#145;maid servants and female apprentices&#146; and she became convinced of the need for working-class girls to be provided with a more useful education. At the time less than 20 per cent of Scottish girls received school training in sewing and almost none were given guidance in cooking.<br>
<br>In 1849 the Church of Scotland called for the creation of female &#145;schools of industry&#146;, and in 1852 Louisa Hope played a leading part in the establishment of the Scottish Ladies Association for Promoting Female Industrial Education. This was an influential society composed largely of wealthy women associated with the church. Its object was to encourage the instruction of working-class girls in appropriate domestic and industrial skills and Christian beliefs, and it sought to persuade upper-class women to promote such a programme in their localities. In 1853 the association established a boarding-house in Edinburgh for young women training to become teachers. Louisa Hope published her opinions on this movement in her book <span class="italic">The Female Teacher: Ideas Suggestive of her Qualifications and Duties</span> (1853).<br>
<br>From childhood Louisa Hope was a close friend of Lord Aberdeen's family and it may have been her connection with the prime minister (1852&#150;5) which resulted in her being given the &#145;urgent and very worrying mission [of] training nurses&#146; in the latter part of the Crimean War. During her stay in London at this time she assisted the Revd William Gill at the National, Industrial and Sunday School in Fitzroy Square. In 1858 she organized a petition of 130 of &#145;the principal ladies of Scotland&#146; protesting at the lack of needlework instruction for Scottish schoolgirls, and she wrote many letters to the press on this and related subjects (see, especially, <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 18 Feb 1865). In 1860 she submitted a paper to the Social Science Association calling for improved domestic education for girls and female teachers (see <span class="italic">Transactions of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, Glasgow Meeting</span> 1860, 397&#150;404).<br>
<br>The activities of Louisa Hope and her friends were more influential than has sometimes been appreciated. An act of 1861 enabled grants to be made to parish schools which employed a woman to teach girls household skills, and by 1872, when Scottish elementary education came under secular control, almost 70 per cent of girls in inspected schools were being taught sewing. Moreover a tradition had been established whereby upper-class ladies lent support to female domestic training in local schools. These developments formed the foundation for the eventual full introduction of domestic science.<br>
<br>For many years Louisa Hope was a notable Edinburgh character. Her nephew described her as &#145;a strange mixture&#151;so odd, so ugly and sometimes so disagreeable&#151;but the cleverest of the sisters&#146;  (Hope Family MSS). Yet her delightful private memoir of her childhood shows that she was also a woman of real wit and charm. She died at her home, 11 Gloucester Place, Edinburgh, on 23 October 1893.<br>
