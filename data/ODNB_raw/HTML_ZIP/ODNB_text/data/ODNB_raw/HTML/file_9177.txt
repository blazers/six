<span class="headword">Farquhar, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1772&#150;1843), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was a younger son of Robert Farquhar of Newhall, Kincardineshire, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of James Morison, of Elsick, provost of Aberdeen in 1745. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67783/', "William Farquhar (1774&#150;1839)")</script> was a younger brother. He was educated at Aberdeen by a private tutor, and entered the navy in October 1787 on board the <i>Lowestoft</i>. After serving in several other ships, mostly on the home station, and having passed his examination, he entered on an East India Company's ship. He had scarcely, however, arrived in India when news of the war with France led him to enter on board the sloop <i>Hobart</i>, from which he was removed to the flagship, and in April 1798 was promoted lieutenant. On his return to England as first lieutenant of the <i>Heroine</i> he was employed in various ships on the home, Mediterranean, Baltic, and North Sea stations, until promoted commander on 29 April 1802.<br>
<br>In January 1804 Farquhar was appointed to the bomb (mortar) vessel <i>Acheron</i>. On 4 February 1805, when in company with the sloop <i>Arrow</i>, he was in charge of convoy but was captured by two large French frigates, after a defence that was pronounced by the court martial (28 March 1805) to have been &#145;highly meritorious and deserving imitation&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 545) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28314/', "Vincent, Richard Budd")</script>]. Farquhar was acquitted, and a few days later, on 8 April, he was advanced to post rank. He was afterwards presented with a sword, value &pound;100, by the patriotic fund, and by the merchants of Malta with a piece of plate and complimentary letter, 19 September 1808.<br>
<br>From 1806 to 1809 Farquhar commanded the <i>Ariadne</i> (20 guns) in the Baltic and North Sea, during which time he captured several privateers, French and Danish. On 15 August 1809 he married Jane Murray (<i>d</i>. 1816); they had four children, of whom two predeceased their father. From 1809 to 1814 Farquhar commanded the frigate <i>D&eacute;sir&eacute;e</i> in the North Sea, captured many privateers, gunboats, and armed vessels, and was senior naval officer in the operations in the Weser, the Ems, and the Elbe in 1813, which culminated in the capture of Gl&uuml;ckstadt on 5 January 1814. For these important services Farquhar was made a knight of the Sword of Sweden. In 1815 he was made a CB, in 1816 KH, and in September 1817 he received the freedom of Aberdeen. From May 1814 to April 1816 he commanded the frigate <i>Liverpool</i> (40 guns) at the Cape of Good Hope, and from 1830 to 1833 the <i>Blanche</i> in the West Indies, with a broad pennant; for his services there during a slave revolt he received the thanks of the house of assembly of Jamaica, a sword valued at &pound;150, and a piece of plate from the merchants. He was made KCH in 1832 and on his return home in 1833 he was dubbed knight bachelor. He became rear-admiral in 1837, and died at his residence, Carlogie Cottage, Aberdeenshire, on 2 October 1843.<br>
