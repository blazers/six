<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colomb, Sir  John Charles Ready</span>  (1838&#150;1909), <span class="occ">defence strategist and advocate of imperial federation</span>, second son of Lieutenant-General George Thomas Colomb (1788&#150;1874), colonel of the 97th regiment, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Abraham Bradley King, bt, of Corrard, co. Fermanagh, was born on the Isle of Man on 1 May 1838. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5981/', "Vice-Admiral Philip Howard Colomb")</script> was his elder brother.<br>
<br>Colomb was educated privately and at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth. He entered the Royal Marine Artillery in June 1854; he was promoted lieutenant in 1855 and captain on 3 August 1867, and retired on 20 October 1869. He was subsequently adjutant of the Cork artillery militia until May 1872 but, enjoying a comfortable private income, for the rest of his life devoted most of his energies to advocacy of the causes with which he became so closely associated: imperial federation and imperial defence.<br>
<br>The Royal Navy's nineteenth-century adoption of steam power necessitated the creation of a worldwide network of coal depots, which had to be defended. Colomb was the first to consider publicly the problems involved. In 1867 he published anonymously <span class="italic">The Protection of our Commerce and Distribution of our Naval Forces Considered</span>, generally regarded as the first systematic enunciation of imperial defence requirements in the machine age.<br>
<br>British defence planning was dominated by fears of invasion of the home islands. In 1859 the royal commission on the defence of the United Kingdom had concluded that the country could not depend on the navy alone, and advocated elaborate fortifications to defend major ports and arsenals. Colomb disagreed with this fortress mentality. National security was, he acknowledged, an issue of &#145;paramount importance&#146;; also crucial was the protection of commerce, and commercial and imperial security required overseas bases from which naval forces could protect commerce, be established and defended. He emphasized the necessity of coal to the steam-powered navy, and advocated stockpiling supplies at the overseas bases and coaling stations.<br>
<br>So far from perceiving imperial defence to be solely a naval task, as did later and more extreme proponents of the &#145;blue water school&#146; of strategy, Colomb envisaged two important roles for military forces. First, warships were too valuable as commerce protectors to be used to defend the bases from which they operated; such local defence, he maintained, was best provided by fixed fortifications and either marines (his preference) or soldiers. Second, the bulk of the army should be held in readiness not for home defence but for amphibious operations. The navy, as he said, should be the &#145;shield&#146; and the army the &#145;spear&#146; of imperial defence  (D'Egville, 15&#150;16). He did not deviate significantly from these fundamental strategic premises for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Colomb also devoted much time and energy to pressing two ancillary issues: the essential tasks of securing army&#150;navy co-operation and fostering imperial&#150;colonial defence co-operation. To these ends he frequently addressed the Royal United Service Institution and the Royal Colonial Institute, and his speeches were published as pamphlets. Other speeches were collected in <span class="italic">The Defence of Great and Greater Britain</span> (1880). He was one of the founding members of the Imperial Federation League (1884), the chief aims of which were collective security and a preferential imperial tariff policy. He was one of the league's delegation which pressed Lord Salisbury's government to call the first Colonial Conference (1887), the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of which was apportioning defence responsibilities between the British government and Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and the Australian colonies. In recognition of his efforts he was made CMG in 1887 and KCMG in 1888.<br>
<br>Colomb unsuccessfully contested the Bow and Bromley division of Tower Hamlets, London, at the 1885 general election. He was Conservative MP for Bromley and Bow from 1886 to 1892, and for Great Yarmouth from 1895 until he retired in 1906. He spoke frequently on subjects related to imperial defence. His observations made in a 1901 speech on the navy estimates succinctly summed up his impelling ideology: &#145;Can we go on indefinitely paying for the defence of an Empire which covers all parts of the world out of the resources of an island in but a corner of it? I am a true imperialist&#151;I always have been that; but I hate the Imperialism which perorates about the Empire and refuses to face the real question of making the arrangements for its common security a matter of practical and united action of all of its parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 4</span>, 91, 21 March 1901, col. 783). His expertise prompted appointment to the royal commission on the supply of food and raw material in time of war (1905). After he left parliament he continued a tireless advocate of imperial federation, writing to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, making speeches, and using every opportunity to press for greater home&#150;colonial co-operation.<br>
<br>Colomb lived to see one of his great aims achieved with the establishment of the committee of imperial defence to co-ordinate the activities of the services. Sir George Sydenham Clarke attributed much of the credit for Balfour's reconstituting the cabinet defence committee as an imperial defence body proper to Colomb, and Howard D'Egville&#151;Colomb's parliamentary private secretary and biographer&#151;claimed that he &#145;was in constant private communication with the Prime Minister, and was to a large extent responsible for the increasing interest which Mr. Balfour showed in the study of the higher policy of defence&#146;  (D'Egville, 59&#150;60).<br>
<br>Colomb's other public interest&#151;Ireland&#151;doubtless resulted from the acquisition of the estate of Dromquinna, Kenmare, co. Kerry, by his marriage. As an Irish landlord he spoke frequently in parliamentary debates on Ireland, and he published numerous essays and letters on various aspects of the Irish situation. He was also active as an Irish JP, served as chairman of appeals under the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> (1898), became a privy councillor for Ireland (1903), and served on the royal commission on the congestion of Ireland (1906&#150;7).<br>
<br>Colomb married Emily Anna (<i>d</i>. 1907), daughter of Robert Samuel and Anna Maria (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Spread) Palmer, and widow of Charles Augustus Francis Paget, lieutenant RN, on 1 January 1866. According to D'Egville, her &#145;active sympathy and co-operation with her husband throughout his life was to him a source of perpetual encouragement and inspiration&#146;  (D'Egville, xi). They had a son and two daughters. Colomb himself was remembered by his daughter Lady Snagge as a charming and cultivated man, known affectionately to his family as Uncle Johnny. He died on 27 May 1909 at his residence, 75 Belgrave Road, London, ten days after a serious operation.<br>
<br>Vice-Admiral Philip Howard Colomb credited his younger brother with the leading role &#145;in laying down and continually differentiating the governing principles of Imperial Defence&#146;, calling <span class="italic">The Protection of our Commerce</span> &#145;the key-note to all subsequent discussions&#146;, and this assessment captures contemporary perceptions of the man and his life's work  (D'Egville, xiv). There can be no disputing his importance as a lobbyist and publicist for imperial defence and federation. How much impact his efforts had on official policy is less clear. Certainly the Admiralty was aware of the importance of stockpiling coal and defending depots by the late 1850s, several years before Colomb's first pamphlet, and the evolution of imperial defence policy during the 1860s, 1870s, and early 1880s owed little to him directly. His star rose with the growth of imperialist sentiment after 1880, and by the beginning of the twentieth century he was widely regarded as an imperial defence pioneer. &#145;As pioneers of British naval thought and history&#146;, Donald Schurman has concluded, the influence of the Colomb brothers &#145;is hard to exaggerate&#146;  (Schurman, <span class="italic">Education of a Navy</span>, 11).<br>
