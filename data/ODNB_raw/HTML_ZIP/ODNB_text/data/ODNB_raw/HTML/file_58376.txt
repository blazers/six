<span class="headword">Tate,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1448&#150;1507/8), <span class="occ">merchant and paper maker</span>, was probably the eldest son of John Tate (<i>c</i>.1409&#150;1478), mercer and sometime mayor of London, and his wife, Elizabeth, whose maiden name was probably Marshall. He was apprenticed to the Mercers' Company and was made free in 1474. It was probably in this year that he married Elizabeth, with whom he had three sons, John, Robert, and Thomas. Elizabeth outlived her husband by at least fifteen years and remarried. In his will, Tate described himself as &#145;of Mincing Lane &hellip; Citizen and Mercer of London&#146;  (Blewett, &#145;John Tate &hellip; further observations&#146;, 258&#150;63). Tate must have inherited his father's house in Mincing Lane where he also owned another at the time of his death as well as estates near Hertford, in Essex, and elsewhere, so he possessed considerable wealth.<br>
<br>Tate traded as a mercer and therefore principally in fine cloth but possibly in other goods too. The Tate family was influential in the city of London for its members held the offices of alderman, sheriff, and mayor at various times. His father was also a member of the staple at Calais. They would have had trading links with Italy as well. Whether it was these connections or the return from the continent in 1475 of another mercer, William Caxton, who established the first printing press in Britain in London, that turned Tate's attention to paper making will never be known.<br>
<br>The first paper that was used in England came from Italy and France, and by this period had become of sufficient quality and cheap enough to rival parchment. The colophon in the <span class="italic">De proprietatibus rerum</span> printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1495 reveals that John Tate had established a paper mill in England and had made the paper for this book. The paper has Tate's unique watermark, an eight-pointed star or petals of a flower set in a double circle, and de Worde used this paper in some of his other books. This watermark appears also in the printed version of a papal bull recognizing the marriage of Henry VII to his distant cousin Elizabeth of York, issued in 1494. This is the earliest definite surviving evidence of Tate's paper, although earlier dates of 1476, 1485, and 1491 have been suggested. To have produced paper ready for printing in 1494 must have required an earlier production date but when is not known. The quality of Tate's paper is good and stands comparison with contemporary sheets.<br>
<br>The moulds Tate used to produce the paper were probably Italian and a study of the watermarks shows that he made at least two different sizes of sheet on various moulds. This suggests that the mill was quite a large establishment. Tate adapted the water-powered Sele mill, a little upstream from Hertford and its royal castle. No details of the machinery have survived. Henry VII visited the mill in May 1498 when Tate probably had special watermarks of Tudor roses attached to his moulds. Publications and manuscripts with Tate's watermarks have been found as late as 1510 or even 1512 but it is very doubtful whether production continued as long as this. Tate instructed in his will, made on 10 October 1507, that his paper mill be sold, which suggests that it was not functioning by then. However, Thomas Bolle of Hertford was to receive some &#145;whit or other paper&#146; which must indicate that the Sele mill was in use at least as a warehouse  (Blewett, &#145;John Tate &hellip; further observations&#146;, 258&#150;63). The reasons for Tate's ceasing production are unknown. He died in London in 1507 or 1508, and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-East. It would be another fifty years before a second paper mill was established in Britain and then only for brown paper.<br>
