<span class="headword">Goehr,  Walter</span>  (1903&#150;1960), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born on 28 May 1903 in Berlin, the elder of the two sons of Julius Goehr (1872&#150;1948), factory owner, and his wife, Thekla Mendelsohn (<i>d</i>. 1931). His parents were both Jewish. His early musical talent showed itself in the fact that, even preceding his formal education in the composition class of Arnold Schoenberg at the Berlin Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik (1921&#150;4), he had already worked as a conductor of operetta in Berlin theatres. His compositions were performed in Germany until he left that country in 1932, and he was director of music in the theatre of Erwin Piscator. His compositions included a symphony (performed in Kiel), a radio opera, <span class="italic">Malpopita</span> (which was in fact the first ever written for the medium), and &#145;Amerikanisches Songbuch&#146;, <span class="italic">Pep</span>, in collaboration with Lion Feuchtwanger (which was performed at the Baden-Baden Music Festival), chamber music, and songs. Although his student works reflect the influence of his teacher, Schoenberg, he gradually moved into the kind of projects associated with Paul Hindemith, Hanns Eisler, and Kurt Weill. He mainly worked in the theatre, and for the influential Berlin Radio. On 5 August 1930 he married pianist and photographer Laelia Rivlin (<i>b</i>. 1908), from whom he was divorced in 1953, having had a son, the composer Alexander Goehr.<br>
<br>Goehr lost his job at Berlin Radio in 1932 because of his Jewish origins, but at that moment he was invited to London to work as music director for the Gramophone Company (later EMI), and he emigrated with his wife and newly born son. At the Gramophone Company he was responsible for the preparation of the musical materials for recordings, he assisted conductors and artists, and he accompanied (often unacknowledged on the record labels) singers, among them Gigli and John McCormack. He assisted Stravinsky at the first recording of <span class="italic">Les noces</span>, and the story (possibly apocryphal) is told that, because Stravinsky was unable to get one of the takes right, after he had left London the cast was reassembled, and Goehr re-recorded it. Among his own acknowledged recordings of the pre-1939 period were the first performance on record of Bizet's symphony, Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto with Egon Petri, and Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto with Benno Moiseiwitsch. He also contributed to the then revolutionary recorded history of music with the first ever recording of a work by Edgard Var&egrave;se (his <span class="italic">Int&eacute;grales</span>).<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Goehr appeared frequently on BBC broadcasts with his own Orchestra Raymonde. This consisted of some of London's finest players (including Alfredo Campoli, Reginald Kell, and Arthur Cleghorn). Using an innovatory chamber orchestra influenced by Schoenberg, Hindemith, and Stravinsky, he created a repertory of arrangements ranging from Haydn and Mozart to Mussorgsky, Bizet, and even Duke Ellington. It was probably the success of this venture that obtained for him his regular work during the Second World War, writing and conducting much of the music used in wartime radio programmes, such as <span class="italic">Marching On</span> and <span class="italic">Shadow of the Swastika</span>. The BBC team who made these programmes, directed by Lawrence Gilliam, was to become the features department after the war, and Goehr wrote music for and conducted a great number of their later programmes, including those written by Louis Macneice, Wyndham Lewis, and others. In addition, he worked on a number of British films, including <span class="italic">Colonel Blimp</span> (1943), <span class="italic">A Matter of Life and Death</span> (1946, as music director), and David Lean's <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> (1946, as composer). During the war he used the English-sounding pseudonym George Walter.<br>
<br>In the later war years and in the immediate post-war years Goehr achieved considerable success as a conductor of modern and old music. The Walter Goehr concerts at the Wigmore Hall included works by Schoenberg, Bart&oacute;k, and Stravinsky, as well as the first performances of Britten's <span class="italic">Serenade</span> (1943, with Peter Pears and Dennis Brain) and Tippett's <span class="italic">Concerto for Double String Orchestra</span>. At the Central Hall, Westminster, he introduced London to Tippett's <span class="italic">A Child of our Time</span> (1944) and to the Monteverdi <span class="italic">Vespers</span> of 1610. The choir was from Morley College, and it was Goehr's work with Tippett there that led to their close collaboration over a number of years, culminating in the dedication to Goehr of the &#145;Ritual Dances&#146; from <span class="italic">A Midsummer Marriage</span>. In 1946 Goehr returned to the BBC as conductor of the Theatre Orchestra, remaining there until 1949.<br>
<br>The last decade of Goehr's life was characterized, on the one hand, by an expansion of his activity as a symphonic conductor and recording artist, and on the other by his pioneering work as an editor of performing editions of works by Monteverdi. After the performance of the 1610 <span class="italic">Vespers</span> at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of the (1951) Festival of Britain, he continued frequently to perform the <span class="italic">Vespers</span> in his own version, and it was owing to these performances that the work became widely popular. His edition of <span class="italic">L'incoronazione di Poppaea</span> was performed at the Hamburg State Opera and elsewhere.<br>
<br>As a symphonic conductor working in Britain, Europe, and South America, Goehr was known for his remarkable ability to make unusual programmes, juxtaposing old and new, and for his advocacy of contemporary music, giving first British performances to works by Mahler, Schoenberg, Webern, Messaien, and Hindemith, as well as Tippett and Britten, and for his often provocative editions and performances of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century works by Gabrieli, Purcell, Monteverdi, Handel, and Bach. At the same time he recorded a wide repertory of works for the American Concert Hall label, associated in Europe with Jeunesses Musicales, winning the grand prix du disque. In addition to his activities as a practising musician, he was a thought-provoking teacher, with a unique insight (for his time) into analytic techniques and their application to performance practice. Goehr was married for a second time on 22 November 1957; his wife was Jean Morrison (<i>b</i>. 1927), a secretary and publisher. He died in the city hall, Sheffield, on 4 December 1960, having finished conducting a performance of Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>. He was buried at Paddington new cemetery, Mill Hill, London.<br>
