<span class="headword">Walker,  James</span>  (1764&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was son of James Walker of Innerdovat in Fife and his wife, Mary, daughter of Alexander Melville, fifth earl of Leven and fourth earl of Melville. He entered the navy in 1776 on the frigate <i>Southampton</i>, in which he served for five years, in the West Indies, then in the channel. He was appointed to the <i>Princess Royal</i>, the flagship of Sir Peter Parker (1721&#150;1811), who, on 18 June 1781, promoted him lieutenant of the <i>Torbay</i>, one of the squadron that accompanied Sir Samuel Hood to North America. The <i>Torbay</i> took part in the action off Chesapeake on 5 September, in the operations at St Kitts in January 1782, and in the battle of Dominica on 12 April. Walker, whose father was an intimate friend of George Brydges Rodney, was on the point of being promoted when Rodney was superseded by Admiral Pigot, and the chance was gone; he was still in the <i>Torbay</i> when, on 17 October 1782, in company with the <i>London</i>, she destroyed the French <i>Scipion</i> in Samana Bay, Haiti.<br>
<br>After the peace, Walker spent some years in France, Italy, and Germany. While in Vienna in 1787 he heard of the Dutch armament and immediately started for England. Near Aschaffenburg, the diligence in which he was travelling, and which was carrying a considerable sum of money, was attacked by robbers. Walker put up resistance but was knocked on the head, stripped, and thrown into the ditch. He was carried into Aschaffenburg, where his wounds were dressed. Although the Frankfurt lodge of freemasons offered financial assistance, the delay prevented his reaching England until the crisis with the Dutch was over, so he returned to Germany. In 1788 he was offered command of a Russian ship, but the Admiralty refused him permission to accept it. In 1789 he was appointed to the <i>Champion</i> on the coast of Scotland. After postings to the <i>Winchelsea</i> and, in 1793, the <i>Boyne</i>, he was moved as first lieutenant into the frigate <i>Niger</i>, which was attached to the Channel Fleet under Lord Howe and was one of the repeating ships in the battle of 1 June 1794 in the north Atlantic.<br>
<br>On 6 July Walker was rewarded with the rank of commander. Short commissions as acting captain of the <i>Gibraltar</i> and commander of the bomb-vessel <i>Terror</i> led to his appointment in June 1795 as acting captain of the <i>Trusty</i>, in which, having escorted five East Indiamen to a latitude of safety, he learned that some forty English merchant ships were at Cadiz waiting for convoy. Disregarding orders to return to Spithead, he went to Cadiz and brought the ships home, with property, as represented by the merchants in London, of the value of upwards of &pound;1 million, &#145;which but for his active exertions would have been left in great danger at a most critical time, when the Spaniards were negotiating a peace with France&#146;  (Ralfe, 159). It was probably this very circumstance that made the government attentive to the Spanish complaint that money had been smuggled on board the <i>Trusty</i> on account of the merchants. Walker was accordingly tried by court martial for disobeying orders and dismissed the service. In March 1797, after war had broken out with Spain, he was reinstated, and soon appointed to a gunboat intended to act against the Nore mutineers; afterwards, as acting captain of the <i>Garland</i>, he convoyed the Baltic trade as far as Elsinore. On his return he was appointed, still as acting captain, to the <i>Monmouth</i>, which he commanded in the battle of Camperdown on 11 October. As they were bearing down on the enemy, Walker addressed the hands:<blockquote>My lads, you see your enemy; I shall lay you close aboard and give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters [alluding to the recent mutiny] in the blood of your foes. Now, go to your quarters and do your duty. (Ralfe, 160)</blockquote>In the battle two of the Dutch ships surrendered to the <i>Monmouth</i>. On 17 October Walker's promotion as captain was confirmed. Temporary command of various ships in the North Sea followed, and in 1801 he commanded the <i>Isis</i> (50 guns) in the fleet sent to the Baltic, and was in Nelson's squadron at the battle of Copenhagen. In addition to a 14 gun battery, Walker engaged both his own intended target and that of Nelson, whose flagship, the <i>Elephant</i>, had run aground. When the <i>Elephant</i> was refloated and sailed past, Nelson took off his hat, waved it, and cried, &#145;Well done, brave Walker! Go on as you have begun; nothing can be better&#146;  (Marshall, <span class="italic">Royal Naval Biography</span>, 1/2, 1823, 161). After four and a half hours' fighting the two Danish blockships were reduced to silence, but at the heavy cost of 33 killed and 88 wounded out of the <i>Isis</i>'s complement of 350.<br>
<br>Walker shortly afterwards took a convoy to the West Indies in the frigate <i>Tartar</i>. There he was appointed to the <i>Vanguard</i>, and on the renewal of the war took an active part in the blockade of San Domingo, in the capture of the French <i>Duquesne</i> on 25 July 1803, and in the capture of St Marc, taking off its garrison of 1100 men, who were on the verge of starvation, to save them from the vengeance of the local people. Walker returned to England in the <i>Duquesne</i> and was then appointed to the frigate <i>Thalia</i>, in which, after taking convoys to the East Indies and to Quebec, he commanded a squadron of three frigates on the Guernsey station.<br>
<br>In October 1807 he was appointed to the <i>Bedford</i>, one of the ships that went to Lisbon and to Rio de Janeiro with Sir William Sidney Smith. When the fleet dispersed in a gale, Walker's ship alone escorted the two Portuguese men-of-war carrying the Portuguese royal family for the thirteen-week voyage to Rio. For the next two years Walker remained at Rio, where he was admitted to the friendship of the prince regent of Portugal, who on 30 April 1816 conferred on him the order of the Tower and Sword, and, when Walker was recalled to England, presented him with his portrait set with diamonds and a valuable diamond ring. The <i>Bedford</i> was afterwards employed in the North Sea and in the channel, and in September 1814 went out to the Gulf of Mexico, where, during the absence of the flag officers at New Orleans, Walker was left as senior officer in command of the large ships. He was reportedly an officer of pleasing and cheerful disposition who won the respect of his crew by lenity and goodness, and was complimented by his admiral, Sir William Young, for once going five months and three weeks on the <i>Bedford</i> without a flogging while the ship remained in the highest state of discipline.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1814 Walker was selected to accompany the duke of Clarence to Boulogne to bring over the emperor of Russia and king of Prussia. On 4 June 1815 he was nominated a CB. After the peace he commanded the <i>Albion</i>, <i>Queen</i>, and <i>Northumberland</i>, which last was paid off on 10 September 1818, ending his long service afloat. He was promoted rear-admiral on 19 July 1821.<br>
<br>He was twice married: his first wife was a daughter of General Sir John Irvine; his second was the third daughter of Arnoldus Jones Skelton MP (first cousin of the Marquess Cornwallis); they had three sons. Walker died after a few days' illness, on 13 July 1831, at Blatchington, near Seaford; he was survived by his second wife.<br>
