<span class="headword">Playfair, Sir  Robert Lambert</span>  (1828&#150;1899), <span class="occ">author and colonial administrator</span>, born at St Andrews, Fife, on 21 March 1828, was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22366/', "James Playfair")</script>, principal of the University of St Andrews, and the third son of George Playfair (1782&#150;1846), chief inspector-general of hospitals in Bengal, and his wife, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1862), the daughter of John Ross. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22368/', "Lyon Playfair, Baron Playfair")</script>, was his elder brother. After an education in St Andrews and at Addiscombe College, he entered the Royal (Madras) Artillery in 1846. In 1861 he was transferred to the Madras staff corps, and in 1863 he was given the local rank of lieutenant-colonel at Zanzibar. He retired from the army as lieutenant-colonel on 1 November 1867. In 1851 he married Agnes Ranken, the daughter of Major-General Thomas Webster, of Belgarvie, Fife; they had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From November 1848 to May 1850 Playfair was associated with Sir James Outram in a quasi-political mission to Syria. From March 1852 until September 1853 he served as assistant executive engineer at Aden, and in 1854, when Outram became first political resident there, the latter chose Playfair as his assistant. In this capacity, under Outram and his successors, Playfair remained at Aden until 1862. He acted as temporary political resident from 19 April 1860 to 30 October 1861, and for a short time in 1862. While assistant resident he took a share in suppressing the traffic in slaves between Arabia and Somaliland, and in the events connected with the British occupation of Perim in 1857. He had qualified as interpreter of Arabic, and used his time at Aden to research the history of that part of Arabia. His work was published at Bombay as <span class="italic">History of Arabia Felix, or, Yemen from the commencement of the Christian era to the present time</span> (1859), including an account of the British settlement at Aden. In 1860 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1862 Playfair was appointed political agent at Zanzibar, and in July 1863 became consul there. On 20 June 1867 he became consul-general in Algeria, where he remained for the rest of his diplomatic career. On 16 March 1885 he was made consul-general for Algeria and Tunis, and on 2 August 1889 consul-general for the territory of Algeria and the northern coast of Africa. He acquired an extensive knowledge not only of Algeria, but of the Mediterranean countries generally, visiting among other places the Balearic Islands and Tunis, where in 1876 he explored the Khomair country, previously almost unknown to Europeans. In 1874 he wrote <span class="italic">A Handbook for Travellers in Algeria</span>, published in Murray's series; a second edition including Tunis appeared in 1878, and a fifth in 1895. In 1881 he wrote for the same series <span class="italic">A Handbook to the Mediterranean Cities, Coasts, and Islands</span>, which reached a third edition in 1890. During his residence in Algeria he studied the official archives of the consulate, and in 1884 he produced <span class="italic">The Scourge of Christendom</span>, an interesting account of British relations with Algeria until the French conquest in 1830. His most valuable work in connection with the Barbary states was <span class="italic">A Bibliography of Algeria from the Expedition of Charles V in 1541 to 1887</span> (1888). This work, which originally appeared among the <span class="roman">Supplementary Papers</span> of the Royal Geographical Society, was completed in 1898 by a supplement carrying the bibliography from the earliest times to 1895. In 1889 he brought out <span class="italic">The Bibliography of Tripoli and the Cyrenaica</span>, from the earliest times to 1889, which was also included among the <span class="roman">Supplementary Papers</span>, and finally in 1892 he prepared, in conjunction with Dr Robert Brown, <span class="italic">A Bibliography of Morocco from the Earliest Times to 1891</span>. These works were of the most exhaustive character. <span class="italic">The Bibliography of Tunisia</span> (1889), which completes the series, was prepared by Henry Spencer Ashbee.<br>
<br>On 29 May 1886 Playfair was nominated KCMG. At the meeting of the British Association at Leeds in 1890 he presided over the geographical section. He retired from the diplomatic service on a pension on 1 December 1896. In January 1899 he received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of St Andrews. He died at his residence, 18 Queen's Gardens, St Andrews, on 18 February 1899.<br>
