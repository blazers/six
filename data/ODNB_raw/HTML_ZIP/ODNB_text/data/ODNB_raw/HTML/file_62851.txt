<span class="headword">Plint,  Thomas Edward</span>  (1823&#150;1861), <span class="occ">stockbroker and art collector</span>, was born in Leeds, the son of Thomas Plint, woollen merchant and radical reformer. His father was co-founder, with Samuel Smiles, J. G. Marshall, and Homer Stansfield, of the Leeds Parliamentary Reform Association, which advocated household suffrage. A Liberal, like his father, Thomas Edward Plint endorsed Smiles's notion of self-help, which he combined with the ideals of the Christian socialist movement promoting the benefits of educational opportunities and tract societies for the working classes. He was a dedicated evangelical and served as a lay preacher and superintendent of the East Parade Congregational Chapel's Sunday school in Leeds. Plint was also the author of the posthumously published <span class="italic">Hymns and Sacred Poetry</span> (1862).<br>
<br>Plint's social and religious beliefs were transformed into a visual manifesto in the painting he commissioned from Ford Madox Brown entitled <span class="italic">Work</span> (1852&#150;63; Manchester City Galleries). A celebration of the protestant work ethic, it features a range of physical, religious, and intellectual activities that both artist and patron considered essential to the success of society. The artist's son-in-law noted that Plint &#145;looked upon the picture as destined to effect an important moral, almost more than an artistic, revolution of thought&#146;  (Hueffer, 112). This evangelical spirit permeated other paintings in Plint's collection, such as Brown's <span class="italic">Christ Washing Peter's Feet</span> (1851&#150;6; Tate collection), John Everett Millais's <span class="italic">Christ in the House of his Parents</span> (1849&#150;50; Tate collection), and William Holman Hunt's <span class="italic">Finding of the Saviour in the Temple</span> (1854&#150;60; Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery).<br>
<br>Plint's art collecting, however, was not solely motivated by his religious convictions. That he also enjoyed images of beautiful women is evidenced by his purchase of <span class="italic">Queen Guinevere</span> (1858; Tate collection), painted by the relatively unknown William Morris, and <span class="italic">The Blessed Damozel</span> (1860; Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA), which he first commissioned from the young Edward Burne-Jones in 1857. Like the professional risks that he regularly took on the stock market, Plint gambled on new talent in the art market. His eagerness for Pre-Raphaelite art led Dante Gabriel Rossetti, from whom he purchased nine works, to liken Plint, with the Newcastle collector James Leathart, to &#145;twin lambs at the altar of sacrifice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.355). But Plint diversified his artistic investments to cover more than one school of art. He also owned works by earlier British artists, including J. M. W. Turner, Copley Fielding, Clarkson Stanfield, Samuel Palmer, and John Martin, as well as a few canvases by contemporary French and Flemish artists.<br>
<br>It is estimated that Plint spent &pound;25,000 on his art collection. He continued to commission works from artists even after his fortunes plummeted. While his shares in the stock market profited as a result of the buoyant mid-Victorian economy, his portfolio was diminished during the economic recession of the late 1850s. Plint's anxiety over his mounting debts precipitated his premature and sudden death, at the age of thirty-eight, on 11 July 1861 at his home, 2 Hyde Terrace, Leeds. According to his doctor, the cause of death was due to &#145;great feebleness, temporarily intensified, rather than actual disease of the heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leeds Intelligencer</span>, 3 Aug 1861). Sadly, his wife Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1825/6), daughter of Mary Ann Southgate&#151;whom he had married on 7 May 1846&#151;died two months later, after giving birth to their eleventh child. To provide for his orphaned children, Plint's collection was auctioned at Christies on 7&#150;8 March 1862. While his more conservative purchases fetched good prices, some of his more arcane Pre-Raphaelite commissions fell in value, with the result that the 326 objects in the sale netted only &pound;18,265. A second, smaller sale took place at Christies on 17 June 1865. Plint was buried in Woodhouse cemetery, Leeds.<br>
