<span class="headword">Lake, Sir  Henry Atwell</span>  (1808&#150;1881), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, third son of Sir James Samuel William Lake, fourth baronet (<i>d</i>. 1832), and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1866), daughter of Samuel Turner, was born at Kenilworth, Warwickshire, on 15 December 1808. He was educated at Harrow School and at Addiscombe College. On 15 December 1826 he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Madras engineers, then went to India. Until 1854 he was employed in the public works department, principally on irrigation works. He became lieutenant on 4 March 1831, brevet captain on 22 July 1840, regimental captain in 1852, and brevet major on 20 June 1854. He married, on 14 April 1841, Anne (<i>d</i>. 8 Jan 1847), daughter of the Revd Peregrine Curtois of The Longhills, Lincolnshire; they had two sons and two daughters. One son, Atwell Peregrine Macleod Lake (1842&#150;1915), became an admiral. On 22 February 1848 he married Ann Augusta (<i>d</i>. 20 Dec 1877), daughter of Sir William Curtis, second baronet; they had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>While on leave in England in 1854 Lake volunteered for the Crimean War, and was sent to Kars as chief engineer and second in command to Colonel William Fenwick Williams. He became lieutenant-colonel on 9 February 1855. He strengthened the fortifications of Kars, and took a gallant and prominent part in the defence, including the repulse of the Russian forces under General Muravyov on 29 September 1855. On the surrender of Kars he was sent, with the other British officers, as a prisoner of war to Russia, where he remained until the peace in 1856.<br>
<br>For his services at Kars, Lake received the thanks of parliament, was transferred to the British army as an unattached lieutenant-colonel, and was made a CB, aide-de-camp to the queen, and colonel in the army from 24 June 1856. He received the second class of the Mejidiye and the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and was given the rank of major-general in the Turkish army. On his arrival in England he was presented with a finely ornamented sword of honour and a silver salver by the inhabitants of Ramsgate, where his mother then resided, and where his family was well known. He published <span class="italic">Kars and our Captivity in Russia</span> (1856) and <span class="italic">Narrative of the Defence of Kars, Historical and Military, from Authentic Documents</span> (1857).<br>
<br>Lake was placed on half pay on 12 September 1856, but next year accompanied the earl of Eglinton, lord lieutenant of Ireland, to Dublin as principal aide-de-camp, and in the following year retired from the army on his appointment as a commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, subsequently becoming chief commissioner of police in Dublin. In 1875 he was made a KCB of the civil division, and in 1877 he retired. He died at 63 Regency Square, Brighton, on 17 August 1881.<br>
