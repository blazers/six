<span class="headword">Closterman,  John</span>  (1660&#150;1711), <span class="occ">history and portrait painter</span>, was born in Osnabr&uuml;ck, a prince-bishopric in north Germany, from 1648 ruled alternately by a Roman Catholic bishop and a Hanoverian Lutheran prince. &#145;Mr. Tiburing&#146;, a fellow townsman, gave George Vertue Closterman's place and year of birth  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.44). Houbraken stated in his biography of &#145;Kloosterman&#146; that he was born at Hanover in 1656  (Houbraken, 3.284). This may be the birth date of <a href="#cosubject_75282">John Baptist Closterman [<i>see below</i>]</a>, John's brother, also a painter, who was alive in 1713 when Houbraken visited England.<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlyyears"></a>Family and early years</h2>In his outline biography of John Closterman, Vertue gives his death date as &#145;171..&#146; and only once cites &#145;Bapt. Closterman &lt;face painter&gt;&#146;, as a subscriber to the 1711 London Academy  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.140, 6.168). Certainly after Houbraken's biography John and John Baptist Closterman were conflated. This became apparent only in 1964 with the publication of John's will leaving the bulk of his estate to &#145;my Deare and Loveing Brother John Baptist&#146;  (Stewart, &#145;John and John Baptist Closterman&#146;, 307).<br>
<br>John Closterman was the &#145;son of a painter&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.44), perhaps Hermann Cloisterman, elected burgher of Osnabr&uuml;ck on 22 December 1656, who died on 27 January 1682 and whose wife died on 14 June 1669. Tiburing and John Closterman went &#145;in &hellip; 1679. to Paris, where they staid about 2 years &amp; wrought for de Troyes [Fran&ccedil;ois de Troy]&#146;; &#145;by some of [Closterman's] portraits done after his first coming into England, it is very apparent he had much studyed [de Troy's] manner&#146;  (ibid., 1.44, 3.29). In de Troy's <span class="italic">Marie-Anne de Bourbon, Princesse de Conti</span> (Mus&eacute;e des Augustins, Toulouse), we see the draperies with flickering highlights, ivory flesh tones, and an elegant sprightliness, all characteristics of Closterman's best early English work.<br>
<br>Doubtless Closterman and Tiburing went to England because of the death of Sir Peter Lely, principal painter to Charles II. Vertue states that they came in 1681  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.61). He also mentions Closterman's portrait of John Saunders, master of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, London, dated 1680, implying that the painter may have arrived late in that year (ibid., 2.30; Rogers, no. 84). The picture survives, but is in poor condition. A signed pair of oval busts of an unknown man and woman of 1682  (ibid., nos. 109, 120) and the three-quarter-length <span class="italic">Sir William Petty</span> (<i>c</i>.1683; no. 76) show the impact of the dourness of late works by Lely.<h2>
<a name="PartnershipwithJohnRiley"></a>Partnership with John Riley</h2>Closterman went into partnership with John Riley: &#145;had not Riley died [in 1691] he [Closterman] might have been in debt &amp; the other grown rich because Riley did 10 heads to one whole lenght. or two half lenghts. &amp; for each head Closterman was only to have 30 shillings for the Drapery&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.61). This garbled account seems improbable. Closterman knew the portraiture market, and later displayed a shrewd head for business. There are independent works by him through the 1680s; and in 1688&#150;9 the painter Jacques Parmentier (1658&#150;1730) did work (presumably drapery painting) for him  (ibid., 3.46).<br>
<br>Yet the partnership seems confirmed by the composite character of portraits like the three-quarter-length of Katherine Elliott (<i>d</i>. 1688)&#151;in the Royal Collection&#151;described in a Queen Anne inventory as &#145;Ryley ye Head Closterman ye Drapery&#146;  (Millar, no. 331). Also in the Royal Collection is the remarkable full-length of another royal servant, Bridget Holmes (1686), waving a broom at a backstairs page-boy, who dodges behind a curtain. The humour recalls Dutch genre pictures. The <span class="italic">Bridget Holmes</span> bears a strengthened Riley &#145;signature&#146;, yet as Christopher Lloyd has noted: &#145;the drawing is unusually accurate for [Riley]&#146;  (Lloyd, no. 33). The figures have volume and weight and move easily in space whereas Riley's signed three-quarter-length portrait of a scullion (Christ Church, Oxford) shows a flat, cramped static figure. The <span class="italic">Bridget Holmes</span> also contains an urn with a relief of dancers borrowed from Polidoro da Caravaggio, and an unidentified relief of Roman soldiers on the plinth below it.<br>
<br>The composition, forms, learned allusions, and humour of the <span class="italic">Bridget Holmes</span> seem beyond Riley's powers. But they are found in Closterman's works, such as his mid-1680s full-length <span class="italic">1st Earl Poulett</span> (Paul Mellon Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut; Rogers, no. 78). Dressed elegantly like the royal page, Closterman's smiling boy stands in a landscape, nonchalantly cradling a flint-lock musket, his dog at his side. The picture recalls Lely's Arcadian child portraiture, but Closterman uses contemporary dress. Yet the classical portico behind suggests that the painter also knew the mythological origin of hunting: &#145;Game and hounds are the invention of gods, of Apollo and Artemis&#146;  (Xenophon, 367).<br>
<br>Closterman's three-quarter-length <span class="italic">John Dryden</span> (priv. coll.) was painted about 1683. Behind the bulky, powerfully modelled, smiling sitter is a relief of Poetry being garlanded, an adaptation from Cesare Ripa's allegorical handbook <span class="italic">Iconologia</span>. The painting was engraved as a small illustration in a 1709 edition of Dryden's <span class="italic">Virgil</span> (nearly a decade after Dryden's death) as the work of Riley. But its quality, style, and learned accessories seem more consistent with Closterman.<br>
<br>Closterman's first piece &#145;that gain'd much Credit&#146; was his three-quarter-length portrait of Grinling Gibbons, the woodcarver, and his wife, Elizabeth  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.61), now known only from John Smith's mezzotint (1691; Rogers, no. 38). It is a complex composition, with an elaborate curtain, dramatically foreshortened columns, and a relief of putti (whose meaning is enigmatic). Yet there is lively informality in the crossing diagonal poses of the sitters.<br>
<br>An oblong three-quarter-length (an unusual format) portrait of Mary Morrice, wife of Sir John Carew, bt (Antony House, Cornwall), presently attributed to Riley, is surely also by Closterman. The lighting, drapery forms, learned accessories, and diagonal pose recall the Gibbons portrait. Lady Carew leans on a draped funeral urn carved with cupids, one caressing a dog (symbol of faith); she grasps part of a cupid-and-dolphin (the latter a symbol of resurrection) fountain at the right. Her mourning posture and the images of consolation suggest that the portrait was commissioned after her husband's death in 1692.<h2>
<a name="Eminence"></a>Eminence</h2>The three-quarter-length portrait of Sir Christopher Wren (Royal Society, London) was once attributed to Riley. But its easy, dynamic composition, elegant drapery forms, firm modelling, and (again enigmatic) putto relief proclaim it as Closterman's work of the mid-1690s. Closterman's portrait of Henry Purcell is lost, but known from an engraving of 1698 and a powerful black chalk, life-size head study (NPG), the only identifiable drawing by Closterman. The large-scale head study was reintroduced into England by Kneller in the 1680s, and Closterman's use of this type shows contact with his studio. Both artists came from north Germany; and by 1692, symbolic of his new eminence, Closterman had moved into The Piazza, Covent Garden, where Kneller also rented a house from 1682 to 1703.<br>
<br>In 1689 Riley was nominated steward of the St Luke's Club feast, an occasion founded by Van Dyck &#145;for men of the highest character in Arts and Gentlemen Lovers of Art&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.120) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96316', "Society of the Virtuosi of St Luke")</script>]. But Riley &#145;then being much indisposed of an illness of which he died [March 1691; his place] was supplyd by his friend and companion Mr. John Closterman&#146;  (Vertue, BL, Add. MS 39167B, fol. 75).<br>
<br>Closterman inherited much of Riley's clientele, including Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset, who, says Vertue, &#145;took Closterman with him [to auctions] to have his judgment on the pictures&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 4.21). On Closterman's advice the duke bought a Guercino for 200 guineas &#145;when Guineas was raising [from 20] to 26 shillings a piece&#146;  (ibid.). When the picture was delivered the auctioneer demanded more money, which the duke refused to pay. Closterman himself bought the painting but Somerset &#145;became his greatest enemy and from him went to [Michael] Dahl&#146;  (ibid.). Of the duke and his duchess (the latter with a child) Closterman painted full-lengths, and also a large, lively group portrait of their children (Petworth House, Sussex; Rogers, nos. 89, 90, 92). Although these works have been said to be of the mid-1690s, they must have been completed by 1694, the year the guinea peaked in value.<br>
<br>Of 1696 is Closterman's <span class="italic">Children of John Taylor</span> (NPG; Rogers, no. 97), a picture of rhythmic grace and ravishing colour: harmonies of green and gold, deep orange and silver, mauve and grey. The colour shows Closterman's French training but the composition reflects Van Dyck's <span class="italic">Pembroke Family</span>. The picture illustrates the family motto: &#145;Fame is sweeter than a white rose&#146;. The oldest boy, Brook, is seated at the left (the heraldic right), being crowned by two sisters who hold trumpets of fame; another sister distributes white roses. Brook Taylor holds a recorder, doubtless an allusion to his grandfather Nathaniel Taylor, recorder (judge) of Chester. The Taylor group demonstrates the period's love of witty allegory, and Closterman's light-hearted brilliance at expressing it.<br>
<br>In 1699 Samuel Pepys named only two artists for his proposed gift of a picture of the mathematician Dr Wallis to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, &#145;Sir Godfry Kneller&#146; and &#145;Cloysterman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and the Second Diary</span>, 274). (In the event, Kneller was chosen.) Closterman's eminence in literary-artistic circles is further demonstrated by his subscription to Dryden's <span class="italic">Virgil</span> (1697). The 100 first subscribers, mostly nobility and gentry, paid 5 guineas, and each received the dedication of a plate inscribed with his name and arms. Plate 85 was dedicated to &#145;Mr John Closterman&#146;; his &#145;arms&#146; (which also appear on his 1702 bookplate; Franks Collection, BM) show a unicorn rampant. They were perhaps &#145;canting&#146; arms, wittily alluding to the painter's name and place of birth. Closterman (literally cloistered man) is close to the word <i>Closterbruder</i>, German for monk, whose vow of chastity would make the unicorn an appropriate emblem. Yet the unicorn, save for its horn, recalls the heraldic white horse of Hanover. Kneller was the only other artist who was a first subscriber. Both were &#145;gatherers&#146; of second subscribers, being indebted to Dryden for publishing his <span class="italic">Parallel between Painting and Poetry</span> together with his own translation of Roger De Piles's French version of C.-A. Du Fresnoy's <span class="italic">De arte graphica</span> in 1695. Second subscribers paid 2 guineas and just had their names listed.<h2>
<a name="VisittoSpainandItaly"></a>Visit to Spain and Italy</h2>According to Vertue, &#145;having a desire further to distinguish himself in the Art [Closterman] went to Spain&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.139), the first artist from England to go there. He is documented in Madrid between November 1698 and April 1699 in letters from his host, the British resident, the Hon. Alexander Stanhope, to his son James, afterwards Earl Stanhope  (Stewart, &#145;John and John Baptist Closterman&#146;, 307). (As &#145;Col. J. Stanhope&#146; he was a second subscriber to Dryden's <span class="italic">Virgil</span>.) As a present for James, Closterman painted the father, full-length in Spanish court dress, with a page (compositionally a re-working of the <span class="italic">Bridget Holmes</span>). Through the resident Closterman gained introduction to court, where he painted, in competition with Luca Giordano, a dwarf, and full-lengths of Carlos II and his queen, Maria A&ntilde;a of Neuberg, &#145;in a rich hunting dress, a gun in her hand&#146;, a present for his host  (ibid.). Sadly only the portrait of Alexander Stanhope survives (Chevening, Kent). Also missing are letters which Closterman wrote to Richard Graham &#145;concerning paintings in Spanish palaces&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 5.61).<br>
<br>From Madrid Closterman travelled to Rome, stopping at Florence, where he wrote on 19 August 1699 to Lord Ashley, a friend of James Stanhope's, and also a second subscriber to Dryden's <span class="italic">Virgil</span>. Ashley had asked Closterman to obtain statues of virtues for a monument, probably to his grandfather, the first earl of Shaftesbury. Closterman said that he had been unable to find anyone &#145;in all Lombardy &hellip; for your purpose&#146; because &#145;the[y] all want drawing&#146;. However, he hoped to be in Rome &#145;the first of october where I shall in mediatly see for a master for your ocasion &hellip; I hope to stay in rome six mounths and to see them [the statues] done&#146;  (O'Connell, 159).<br>
<br>Closterman wrote to Lord Ashley again from Rome (&#145;where I did long for these manny years&#146;), enclosing drawings of Prudence and Justice by the sculptor Domenico Giudi, but was lukewarm about them. The painter confessed that &#145;my eyes see so many noble things of the ancients that I cant like nothing else&#146;, although he was also enthusiastic about Bernini's works. Ashley had evidently written &#145;his thoughts for a family pictor, and that I shall perform it as sune I come home &hellip; and to goe into the contry is better still then we shall have howly our thought together&#146;  (Wind, 67&#150;8).<br>
<br>In Rome, Closterman met the leading painter Carlo Maratta (perhaps through Kneller, who had studied with him in the 1670s) and painted Maratta's portrait (Richard Graham's sale, 6 March 1712; Rogers, no. 63). Closterman gained access to Maratta's drawings collection, which included 1800 sheets by Domenichino (then considered to be a second Raphael) and drawings by the Carracci and Raphael himself. Furthermore, Closterman negotiated the purchase of this remarkable collection for a deposit of 1000 scudi, and 4000 scudi on receipt of the drawings. By a dramatic <i>avviso</i> (28 April 1703) Pope Clement XI (Albani) bought the drawings himself, refunding the deposit to the &#145;inglese&#146;. Houbraken told the story in 1718, stating that Closterman was acting for an &#145;English Lord&#146; (probably either the second duke of Devonshire or Lord Somers; Houbraken, 2.236&#150;7); Jonathan Richardson also published an account in 1724. Despite his failure Closterman deserves great credit for his enterprise in furthering the taste for old master drawings, then still relatively novel in England. In 1762 James Adams bought the Albani collection for George III, since when it has been one of the great jewels of the Royal Collection.<br>
<br>John Closterman is recorded on 23 July 1700 in the day book of the third earl of Shaftesbury (as Lord Ashley had become in November 1699) at his Dorset estate, Wimborne St Giles. Vertue says that Closterman:<blockquote>went to Italy returned to England brought over several fine pictures. &amp; went again to Italy. &amp; made an additional Collection to his Pictures. came back &amp; livd with great splendor at his house in Covent Garden haveing improvd his Fortune &lt;considerably&gt;. (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.139&#150;40)</blockquote>Closterman's second Italian trip is confirmed by an auction catalogue of a sale of eighty-nine lots of pictures on 26 December 1702 at the painter's house in Covent Garden. Had Closterman brought the pictures from Rome in 1700, it is inconceivable that he would have waited for nearly two years to sell them. To obtain the latter collection of pictures, he must have gone to Rome again, probably in the summer of that year.<h2>
<a name="Laterworks"></a>Later works</h2>John Closterman was doubtless at Lord Shaftesbury's Dorset estate in July 1700 to paint the &#145;family pictor&#146; referred to in the painter's letter from Rome, a double full-length portrait of the earl and his brother Maurice (NPG; Rogers, no. 86) dressed in neo-Greek tunics and caps. The brothers' pose derives from the Hellenistic sculpture of Castor and Pollux (mythical twins of transcendent virtue), now in the Prado, Madrid, but then in the Odeschalchi collection, Rome.<br>
<br>Closterman also painted separate full-lengths of Lord Shaftesbury and his brother (priv. coll.; Rogers, nos. 87, 5). The earl in a gown, representing contemplative life, holds a book; Maurice (active life) appears in a landscape, flintlock in hand, with a groom below holding a horse. The portraits are linked by a figure behind Shaftesbury carrying the peer's parliamentary robes, illustrating the Neoplatonic doctrine that &#145;active righteousness is only the prerequisite of contemplative illumination&#146;  (E. Panofsky, <span class="italic">Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance</span>, 1962, 192). The robes may commemorate a rapid journey to London which the earl made in February 1701 to vote on the second partition treaty. Shaftesbury leans on a plinth on which are more volumes, two labelled Plato, and another Xenophon, who wrote treatises in praise of hunting (noted above), but also on horsemanship and statesmanship (the <span class="italic">Cyropodeia</span>, which Maurice had translated). The twin portraits develop a theme begun in England with Van Dyck's <span class="italic">Lords Digby and Russell</span> (also indebted to the <span class="italic">Castor and Pollux</span>) which Closterman must have known.<br>
<br>Another picture, also possibly painted for Lord Shaftesbury, is the three-quarter-length Lady Ashe as St Cecilia (priv. coll.; Rogers, no. 4), startling in its grisaille colouring&#151;sober greys and browns, subtly relieved by pinks. Vertue says that &#145;about the beginning of Queen Annes Reign [Closterman] lost him self much; especially as to colouring. for from a strong lively manner. he fell into a grey uncertain colour entirely disagreeable&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.29). Actually Closterman was following Pliny the younger's doctrine of a restricted palette&#151;an idea cited with approval in the seventeenth century by Junius, Kneller, and Lord Shaftesbury, and later by Benjamin Haydon. Yet among English baroque painters, only Closterman seems to have applied the doctrine consistently throughout a whole painting.<br>
<br>In his fourth treatise Shaftesbury revealed his unbounded enthusiasm for Closterman. He dismissed the &#145;face painter &hellip; (as Cooper, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Riley, etc.)&#146;, because the patron (supposedly) saw everything&#151;&#145;nothing when their back is turned&#146;:<blockquote>But when a subject is given to a real painter, a heroic great subject: Good heavens! what toil! What study! &hellip; What restless nights! What &hellip; <i>rabiosa silentia</i> [mad silences]! Here remember what said of Michelangelo. Domenichino &hellip; so my painter [Closterman] going into his picture when in the dark and standing long before it. (Shaftesbury, <span class="italic">Second Characters</span> 131&#150;2)</blockquote>Vertue says that:<blockquote>being a Man of great Ambition. [Closterman] was by some disgust against Sir G Kneller. sett up by a party of his [Closterman's] Freinds in Oppossition. &amp; recommended to &hellip; Queen [Anne]&#151;&lt;at Guildhall a large Picture painted by him&gt; the <span class="italic">Duke of Marlbro'</span> &lt;a large Picture on Horseback with Aligroriall figures&gt; whose pictures he drew &amp; many other people of Quality. (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.139)</blockquote>The London Guildhall commission was won in May 1702 in competition with four other painters, including Kneller and Jonathan Richardson. Perhaps because of Closterman's second Italian trip, the painting was not delivered until February 1703  (Stewart, &#145;John and John Baptist Closterman&#146;, 308&#150;9). It is known only from a three-quarter-length studio version (NPG) and John Faber junior's mezzotint. From these it seems to have been a stiff, even clumsy composition, showing the queen standing in robes, holding the sceptre and orb. Yet it impressed the Dutch painter J. C. Weyerman, who was in England in 1709 and later wrote enthusiastically that the viewer &#145;heard the golden fabrics and other costly silk stuffs crackle&#146;  (Weyerman, 3.190).<br>
<br>In October 1703 Kneller nearly lost another commission to Closterman. The diarist Luttrell noted that the archduke Charles was visiting and &#145;Mr. Closterman, the famous picture-drawer, is goeing to Portsmouth to take his picture&#146;  (Stewart, &#145;John and John Baptist Closterman&#146;, 309). In the event the archduke sat to Kneller (the portrait is in the Royal Collection), but the fact that it could even be mooted that this distinguished visitor would be painted by anyone other than the principal painter shows the seriousness of Closterman's rivalry.<br>
<br>The equestrian <span class="italic">Duke of Marlborough</span> cited by Vertue was engraved (head and shoulders only) with the date 1705 and is now at the Chelsea Royal Hospital, London, having been given first in 1852 to the London Drapers' Company by &#145;Mr William Lyle&#146;, when it was stated to have been painted for &#145;a Duke of Buckingham&#146;  (Rogers, no. 66). Perhaps this was the second duke of Buckingham and Chandos (son of a daughter of the last duke of Chandos) who went bankrupt in 1848 and sold many of his possessions at Stowe. The 1725 inventory of Cannons, the Chandos house, lists only one picture on the staircase wall, &#145;the Duke of Marlborough by Closterman&#146;  (Simon, <span class="italic">English Baroque Sketches</span>), almost certainly the equestrian portrait.<br>
<br>The design of the <span class="italic">Marlborough</span> derives partly from Rubens's <span class="italic">George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham</span> (owned by Closterman's client Sir Francis Child) though vertical, rather than horizontal, and more open and airy. The colour, much of it pale, anticipates the rococo, although the handling of paint has none of the brilliance of Kneller's at this date. Above at the right of Marlborough flies Fame; directly above him is an eagle with a laurel wreath; at the left is Victory, extending a palm to the duke and a profile medallion of Queen Anne. The last motif was a French practice, known as <i>le portrait en tableau</i> (a portrait in a painting).<br>
<br>About 1705 Closterman painted the <span class="italic">Unknown Hunter</span> (priv. coll.; Wilton, no. 22), a full-length wrongly inscribed as by Kneller, and representing the duke of Marlborough. The design is a reworking of the portrait of Maurice Shaftesbury, but the pose is more energetic and the lighting more dramatic. The sublime, wild, brightly lit rocky scenery derives from Salvator Rosa, whom Closterman had copied in Italy for Sir John Cropley. Similar rocky backgrounds occur in Closterman's <span class="italic">Duke of Argyll</span> (1704; priv. coll.) and another three-quarter-length, of about the same date, identified as his work only towards the end of the twentieth century, probably representing Sir Richard Temple, afterwards Lord Cobham (Fairfax House, York).<br>
<br>The enthusiasm for Rosa may have been inspired by Henry Cooke (<i>c</i>.1642&#150;1700), who had been Rosa's pupil. Cooke made his &#145;loveing friend John Closterman&#146; an executor of his will; Closterman in turn named Henry Cooke junior an executor of his own will. Closterman's sale in 1702 included three Rosas, two of which, nos. 17 and 26, because of the subjects and sizes, are almost certainly the <span class="italic">Drunkenness of Noah</span> (priv. coll.; Salerno, no. 223) and <span class="italic">Landscape with Bathers</span> (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut; Salerno, no. 147). In furthering the taste for Rosa, Closterman was again in the van; Rosa was to become extremely popular with English collectors as the century progressed.<br>
<br>On 6 August 1705 Closterman advertised that:<blockquote>being obliged at Christmas next to go to Hanover, and afterwards to several Courts of Germany; so that it is uncertain whether he will ever return to England. Such Persons of Quality and others, as have lately sat to him, are desired to take notice, that their pictures will be finished out of hand, and deliver'd as they shall best please to order them.(<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 6 Aug 1705; Ashton, 281)</blockquote>In April 1706 Closterman advertised again that he, &#145;being oblig'd to leave England very suddenly, will sell all his pictures by Auction&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Closterman's decision to go to Hanover may have been connected with events there. In August 1705 the duke of Celle died, his heir being his nephew George Louis, the elector prince of Hanover, whose increased income led to further artistic patronage. As a Hanoverian, Closterman may have hoped for a share of this. Whether he went, and for how long, is unknown.<br>
<br>However, Closterman did paint Richard Newdegate, who had died aged less than a year on 18 March 1706. The child is shown at length, asleep on a cushion, with angels' heads above (priv. coll.; Rogers, no. 71). The design appears to derive from an engraving by Pieter Jode the younger, after Artemisia Gentileschi's <span class="italic">Child Sleeping</span> (Bissell, fig. 113).<br>
<br>In 1708 Closterman acted again as steward for the St Luke's Club feast  (Vertue, BL, Add. MS 39167, fol. 75<i>v</i>). One of Closterman's latest datable pictures is a portrait of Mathew Prior (priv. coll.), presently called <span class="italic">School of Kneller</span>. It is a sombre-coloured yet boldly lit work, showing the poet in cap and open-necked shirt, with his hand on an upright volume labelled &#145;PRIOR&#146;, presumably his <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1709). He continued his picture-dealing career, advertising a sale for as late as 28 February 1711  (Ashton, 281).<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>Closterman's last days were tragic, something hinted at by Vertue: &#145;sometime before he died he was a little delirious &amp; &lt;not rightly in his senses&gt;&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.140). Closterman had buried his wife, Hannah, on 27 January 1702. Later, according to J. C. Weyerman, he took a beautiful mistress who, while he was away in the country, robbed him of his valuables and disappeared, actions which drove the painter into madness. He was buried in St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, on 24 May 1711. His will of 19 August 1710 was probated on 11 June 1711. It shows that he had a sister &#145;Margareta Catherina Gruter&#146;, wife of his &#145;Servant&#146; (assistant) &#145;Philipus ffranciscus fferdinandus Gruter&#146;. Probably the Gruters lived in the Closterman house in Covent Garden. Another sister, &#145;Anna Maria Muino&#146;, was &#145;liveing at the Hague&#146;  (Stewart, &#145;John and John Baptist Closterman&#146;, 306). John Closterman left his assistant &pound;100 and each sister &pound;500, the residue of the estate going to his brother <a name="cosubject_75282"></a><span class="headword">John Baptist Closterman</span>  (<em>b. </em>1656?, <em>d.</em> in or after 1713), <span class="occ">painter</span>.<br>
<br>John Baptist Closterman is known from two full-lengths, <span class="italic">1st Duke of Rutland</span> (<i>c</i>.1703), signed &#145;J. Baptist Closterman&#146;, and the portrait of the second duke, signed &#145;J. Baptista Closterman, Pinxit Ano 1703&#146; (both priv. coll.). The draperies of the former are painted in a coarsened version of John Closterman's style, and neither shows the sense of structure or handling of space seen in John Closterman's work. John Baptist was clearly a very inferior painter.<br>
<br>Several other documents mention John Baptist Closterman, the earliest recording him in July 1700, with his brother, at Wimborne St Giles. With Margaret, his wife, he had a daughter, Catherine, who was baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 15 November 1711. The month before, in Amsterdam, Egbert and Abraham Edens, art dealers, were instructed by &#145;Jan Baptiste Closterman painter&#146; of London to go to the house of Matheus Crackau, open some boxes left there for safe keeping by &#145;Mons. Frans de Gruter also painter at London&#146;, and make a list of the contents  (Bredius). The pictures listed are mostly copies after Poussin and Jacques Courtois, known as Borgognone, and Closterman portraits. The latter included a copy of a portrait of the &#145;dead Closterman&#146;. This was perhaps after one of the self-portraits recorded by Vertue: &#145;Mr John Closterman his picture painted by himself in the hands of Mr. Cope. Another in possession of Mr. Tiburin&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.29). No portrait of either brother is known to have survived.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>John Closterman's tragic end presaged that of his reputation. For over 250 years his identity and <i>&#339;uvre</i> were conflated with those of his brother. John Closterman's early partnership with John Riley further confused the situation. From late twentieth-century research it is clear that John Closterman was an extremely fine painter, with considerable range. The <span class="italic">1st Earl Poulett</span>, the Shaftesbury portraits, and the <span class="italic">Unknown Hunter</span> are equal to Kneller's best full-lengths. The Chelsea <span class="italic">Duke of Marlborough</span> is the only equestrian portrait of the period to rival Kneller's, while Closterman's <span class="italic">Children of John Taylor</span> is undoubtedly the finest group portrait of the period. Closterman also deserves recognition for his enterprise as an art dealer, especially for furthering an English taste for Salvator Rosa, and for his near acquisition of the Maratta drawings collection.<br>
