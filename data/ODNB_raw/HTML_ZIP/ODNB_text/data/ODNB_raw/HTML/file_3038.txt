<span class="headword">Bowen,  James</span>  (1751&#150;1835), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Ilfracombe. He first went to sea in the merchant service, and in 1776 he commanded a ship in the African and West India trade. Shortly afterwards he entered the navy as a master, and he served in that capacity on board the <i>Artois</i> with Captain Macbride during 1781&#150;2, being present in the battle of the Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781. He continued with Captain Macbride in different ships until 1789, when he was appointed inspecting agent of transports in the Thames. Following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War Lord Howe requested Bowen to go with him as master of his flagship, the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, and he had thus the duty of piloting her into the battle of 1 June 1794. It is reported that on Howe's giving the order &#145;Starboard!&#146; Bowen ventured to say, &#145;My lord, you'll be foul of the French ship if you don't take care&#146;. &#145;What is that to you, sir?&#146; replied the admiral, sharply; &#145;starboard!&#146; &#145;Starboard!&#146; cried Bowen, muttering by no means inaudibly, &#145;Damned if I care, if you don't. I'll take you near enough to singe your black whiskers&#146;. He did almost literally fulfil this promise, passing so close under the stern of the French flagship <i>Montagne</i> that the French ensign brushed the main and mizen shrouds of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> as she fired her broadside into the French ship's starboard quarter. For his conduct Bowen was made a lieutenant on 23 June 1794. After the action off Lorient on 23 June 1795, in which he was first lieutenant of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, he was made commander, and on 2 September of the same year he was advanced to the rank of captain. During the two following years he commanded the <i>Thunderer</i> in the West Indies. In 1798 he commanded the <i>Argo</i> (44 guns) in the Mediterranean, and took part in the capture of Minorca by Commodore John Duckworth; and on 6 February 1799, after a brilliant chase of two Spanish frigates of nearly equal force, he succeeded in capturing one of them, the <i>Santa Teresa</i> (42 guns).<br>
<br>For the next three years Bowen was employed in convoy service, in the course of which he was officially thanked by the court of directors of the East India Company, and presented with a piece of plate worth &pound;400 for his &#145;care and attention&#146; in convoying one of their fleets from England to St Helena. In 1803 he was appointed to command the <i>Dreadnought</i> (98 guns), but shortly afterwards, at Lord St Vincent's suggestion, he was nominated a commissioner of the transport board. As first lord of the Admiralty (1802&#150;4) St Vincent relied heavily on Bowen's practical advice. He was sent to Ireland in 1803, on the outbreak of war, to improve the local naval defences. In 1805 he had the charge of laying down moorings for the fleet in Falmouth harbour, and in the following year he served as captain of the fleet to Lord St Vincent off Brest. In January 1809 he superintended the re-embarkation of the army at Corunna, for which he received the thanks of both houses of parliament. He was appointed one of the commissioners of the navy in February 1816, and continued in that office until August 1825, when he was retired with the rank of rear-admiral. He died on 27 April 1835.<br>
<br>Bowen's brother Richard also served in the navy. As captain of the <i>Terpsichore</i> in July 1797 he was involved in the attack on Santa Cruz and earned Nelson's commendation as an &#145;enterprising, able, and gallant officer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters</span>, 2.423). Another brother, George, also a captain in the navy, died at Torquay in October 1817. No details remain of Bowen's marriage but his eldest son, James, died captain of the frigate, <i>Phoenix</i>, on the East India station, in 1812; and another son, John, also a captain, died in 1828. Both sons had been promoted captain in 1805. According to Sir John Barrow, then second secretary of the Admiralty, the elder's promotion was the result of his being mistaken for his father. James Bowen's youngest son, St Vincent, was a clergyman. He had also a daughter, Teresa, who died in 1876.<br>
<br>Bowen was an outstanding seaman, as his selection by Howe in 1793 testifies. His resolute conduct during the battle of 1 June 1794 earned him a place on the quarter-deck, and his ability an early rise to captain. He was equally effective in administrative posts, and St Vincent's support is evidence of his all-round ability at the higher level.<br>
