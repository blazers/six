<span class="headword">Biggs,  Matilda Ashurst</span>  (1816/17&#150;1866), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights and supporter of Italian independence</span>, was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/785/', "William Henry Ashurst (d. 1855)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Ann Brown (<i>d</i>. 1854), of Muswell Hill, Middlesex. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42330/', "Elizabeth Ann Ashurst (known as Eliza)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56461/', "Caroline Stansfeld")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50085/', "Emilie Venturi")</script> were her sisters. Her father, a successful radical solicitor, held advanced views on the rights of women, and the household in which she and her sisters grew up was a centre of political discussion and activity on the radical causes of the day. On 11 October 1837 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58343/', "Joseph Biggs (1809&#150;1895)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58341/', "Biggs, John (1801&#150;1871)")</script>], the youngest brother and partner in the family hosiery firm in Leicester. The Biggs family had a reputation as progressive employers; Joseph's two elder brothers, John (1801&#150;1871) and William (1805&#150;1881), were prominent radical leaders in municipal politics, who became MPs, respectively, for Leicester (1856&#150;62) and for Newport, Isle of Wight (1852&#150;7).<br>
<br>Matilda and Joseph Biggs settled in Leicester. Although the marriage was to produce four daughters Matilda's was not to be a life of quiet domesticity. She continued to share her family's interest in the anti-slavery question and attended the world anti-slavery convention in London in June 1844 with her father and sister Eliza. The exclusion of the American female delegation from participation in the proceedings led her to a lifelong interest in the political emancipation of her sex. During 1847 she circulated in Leicester one of the earliest printed leaflets in favour of female suffrage, sent to her by a fellow anti-slavery campaigner, Anne Knight (1786&#150;1862). Later in 1859 Biggs openly criticized the Northern Reform Union's refusal to campaign on universal suffrage, writing to the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>:<blockquote>I feel it an injustice that I, who am equally taxed with men, should be denied a voice in making the laws which affect and dispose of my property, and made to support a State, where I am not recognised as a citizen &hellip; The Northern Reform Society, which takes its stand upon &#145;justice&#146;, should claim for us at least that we be exempted from the duties, if we are to be denied the rights belonging to citizens. (19 Feb 1859; Biggs, 839)</blockquote>Biggs also sought to improve the condition of women through local philanthropy; together with her sister Emilie she established a rescue home for prostitutes in Leicester.<br>
<br>The other great cause of Biggs's life, which she shared with her sisters, was that of an independent and unified Italian republic. Following Giuseppe Mazzini's introduction to the Ashurst family in 1844 she developed a long and close, if somewhat stormy, friendship with the Italian revolutionary, though she did not succumb to his religious ideals. Through her marriage she brought Mazzini into contact with the world of English provincial radicalism; his letters to her reveal her long-standing commitment to the cause of Italy through local fund-raising and propaganda activities. For a period in 1850 she was also actively involved in clandestine activity in the south of France. In order to finance republican ventures Mazzini started a scheme of selling bonds, redeemable by the future government of a liberated Italy. His fellow conspirator, Felice Orsini, was given the concession for Piedmont, and Biggs journeyed from England to help distribute the bonds among French and Italian sympathizers. She also accompanied Orsini with letters of introduction from Mazzini to encourage a common front among the leaders of the various national independence movements of Europe. After Orsini's arrest she raised funds on his behalf.<br>
<br>In 1851, following a winter sojourn in Genoa with her sister Emilie, Biggs returned to England, where she and her sister were among the original seventy-five women who joined the council of the Society of the Friends of Italy. Thereafter her activities appear to have been confined to subscription campaigns and letter writing. In April 1854 Mazzini wrote to her: &#145;Go on you, and your pretty aides-de-camp, writing for Italy, and creating sympathies for a possible movement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scritti</span>, 52.116&#150;17, 18 April 1854). During the Polish uprising of 1863 she pressed Mazzini to use his influence to bring aid to the insurgents but none was to be forthcoming.<br>
<br>By 1852 Joseph Biggs had retired from business, probably owing to poor health, and the family moved to Barden Farm, near Tunbridge Wells. In the early 1860s Biggs &amp; Sons Ltd came close to bankruptcy and the scale of business was drastically curtailed, with a consequent diminution in the family's income. Moreover, Matilda's health also was now failing. In July 1865 Mazzini wrote to Emilie, confirming that she was in the last stages of consumption: &#145;The first impression had been favourable; but long attentive watching makes me despair. I think she is glad of my visits&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters to an English Family</span>, 3.109). She died at Barden Farm on 15 October 1866 and was survived by her husband and four daughters. Little is known of the eldest, Elizabeth Ashurst Biggs (1838&#150;1905), or of Ada (<i>b</i>. 1859), the youngest. The second child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56219/', "Caroline Ashurst Biggs (1840&#150;1889)")</script>, became a prominent suffragist in her own right.<br>
<br>The third daughter, <a name="cosubject_74800"></a><span class="headword">Maude Ashurst Biggs</span>  (1856&#150;1933)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at 1 Bolton Row, Mayfair, London, on 26 December 1856 (her name at birth being registered in February 1857 as Matilda). She took up her mother's interest in the subjugated nations of Europe, in particular the cause of Poland. During the 1880s she sought to revive interest in the struggle for Polish independence by bringing the epic poems of Adam Mickiewicz to a wider English audience. In 1882 she published <span class="italic">Konrad Wallenrode</span>, a translation of his historical poem, which took as its theme the suppression of Lithuania by the Teutonic order&#151;a political allegory whose contemporary significance had escaped the Russian censors. In 1885 she followed this with <span class="italic">Master Thaddeus, or, The Last Foray in Lithuania</span>, a translation of a historical poem descriptive of the struggle for independence during the Napoleonic era.<br>
<br>Maude Ashurst Biggs was a longstanding member of the council of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland, which had been established under mainly aristocratic patronage in 1832 to provide material support to Polish &eacute;migr&eacute;s. Under the aegis of the association she published a pamphlet in 1886 entitled <span class="italic">The Forgotten Nation</span>; in this she expressed support for the constitutional rather than revolutionary claims for a Polish nation, drawing attention to the continued religious persecution of Poles in the Russian territories and the Bismarckian programme of &#145;Germanization&#146; in the Prussian provinces. This had resulted in the forced expatriation of many thousands of Poles with subject status in the Russian and Austrian territories. Some of these Poles had emigrated to London, where they received material help from the Literary Association alongside the dwindling number of &eacute;migr&eacute;s who had gone to England after the events of 1830 and 1863.<br>
<br>During the late 1890s Biggs lived in Paris, where she was in contact with the close circle of Polish &eacute;migr&eacute;s, including Ladislas Mickiewicz, son of the famous poet. In 1898 they corresponded about the possibility of publishing the letters of Mazzini to her mother on the Polish cause. These were finally published in the 1920s by E. F. Richards in <span class="italic">Mazzini's Letters to an English Family</span>. Biggs lived to witness the creation of a new Poland following the First World War. In 1920 she published a translation of a collection of Polish fairy tales and in 1924 she wrote a history of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland from 1832 to the present day. She maintained a watchful and maternal eye on developments in Poland during the last years of her life. Fearing the destruction of its primeval forests from economic development she wrote:<blockquote>as one to whom the national, romantic and poetic memories of Poland are hardly less dear than to the Poles themselves, I trust that they will not for the mere sake of material gain, suffer to perish all that natural beauty so deeply associated with the historic past and with the immortal memory of Mickiewicz, poet and patriot alike. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 July 1924)</blockquote>After her residence in Paris Biggs lived in Hampstead and later settled at Idbury Manor, Kingham, Oxfordshire. There she set up the Village Press, a small publishing house under whose imprint she published extracts of her father's diary of his journey to America in 1837, <span class="italic">To America in Thirty-Nine Days: before Steamships Crossed the Atlantic</span>, which remains a well written and interesting account of social and economic life in New York during the early mid-nineteenth century. Other titles that she published included a history of the Women's Institute by J. W. Robertson Scott and a volume of poems by Theo Varlet, translated by Malcolm McLaren.<br>
<br>Biggs died, unmarried, at Idbury Manor on 14 July 1933. In keeping with her feminist heritage she made small bequests to the Society for the Employment of Women and to the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital for Women, as well as a legacy to the Home for Lost and Stray Cats, London.<br>
