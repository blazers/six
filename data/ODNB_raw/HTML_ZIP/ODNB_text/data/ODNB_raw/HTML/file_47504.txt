<span class="headword">Grey,  Thomas  de</span>, second Baron Walsingham  (1748&#150;1818), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 14 July 1748 and baptized on the 17th at St Clement Danes, Westminster, the second but only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11571/', "William de Grey, first Baron Walsingham (1719&#150;1781)")</script>, chief justice of common pleas, and Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1719, <i>d</i>. 1800), daughter of William Cowper (<i>c</i>.1689&#150;1740), clerk of the parliaments. He was educated at Eton College from 1760 to 1765, was admitted to the Middle Temple on 24 August 1764, and in 1766 became a fellow commoner of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, taking his BA degree in 1769. In 1770&#150;71 he travelled in France, Italy, and Germany, on the grand tour. In May 1771 George III appointed him a groom of the bedchamber and it was probably that year that his father, having become a judge, resigned to him the sinecure office of comptroller of first fruits and tenths. On 30 April 1772 he married, at her father's house in Lower Grosvenor Street, Westminster, the Hon. Augusta Georgina Elizabeth Irby (1747&#150;1818), daughter of William, first Baron Boston, chamberlain to the princess dowager of Wales, and his wife, Albinia Selwyn; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Like many of his immediate ancestors, de Grey entered parliament, sitting for Wareham from January to September 1774 and being returned for Tamworth at the general election later that year. He seconded the address of thanks for the speech from the throne on 5 December 1774 and thereafter spoke occasionally in support of Lord North's ministry. In July 1777 he became a lord of trade and from January 1778 to October 1780 he additionally served as an earnest under-secretary to the secretary of state for the colonies, George Germain. Having transferred to Lostwithiel at the 1780 election, he again seconded the address on 6 November. In December that year the king thought him an unsuitable candidate for the position of vice-chamberlain to the queen, remarking that &#145;his manner is certainly not quite genteel and from his hurry he might fill the office but awkwardly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 5.172).<br>
<br>On the death on 9 May 1781 of his father, who had been awarded a peerage in the previous year, de Grey succeeded as second Baron Walsingham, and he took his seat in the Lords on 21 May. In the following month he inherited the family's ancestral estates at Merton Hall, near Thetford in Norfolk, from his uncle and namesake, who had been MP for Norfolk (1764&#150;74). On 27 November 1781 he seconded the address, urging continuation of the war against the American colonies' European allies, and by the end of the year he had tardily relinquished his junior ministerial salary. He spoke and voted against Lord Shelburne's peace preliminaries on 17 February 1783 and Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span> on 17 December 1783, and thereafter supported Pitt's administration. On 31 December 1783 he was sworn of the privy council, which he attended frequently; he was both a friend and a near neighbour (at Leather Lake House, Old Windsor) of the king. In March 1784 he became a member of the privy council committee for trade and plantations and was appointed joint vice-treasurer of Ireland. In that year he also joined the India board (serving until 1791) and, a frequent speaker on departmental matters in the Lords, he seconded the address in January 1785 (as he did in December 1792 and October 1795). In July 1787, having given up all but one of his other offices and declining to be named ambassador to Spain, he became joint postmaster-general, in which capacity he proved himself to be a diligent and reforming administrator. He sided with ministers during the regency crisis in 1789 and on 13 April 1795 spoke in defence of Warren Hastings, whom he voted not guilty on all but one of the impeachment charges ten days later.<br>
<br>Walsingham, whose family had several connections with the parliament office and with the management of the upper chamber, seems to have long coveted the office of chairman of committees in the Lords. A procedural expert, he hoped to replace Lord Scarsdale in July 1783 and, having served an apprenticeship as one of his deputies (notably in the 1784 session), was presumably disappointed to be passed over on Scarsdale's retirement in 1789. It was not until late in 1794 that Pitt, as part of a government reshuffle, gave him the post, which carried a salary of &pound;1500, and provided a pension of &pound;1200 in favour of his sons as compensation for giving up the higher remuneration of the postmastership.<br>
<br>Building no doubt on the initiatives of his legally trained predecessor Lord Cathcart and the general climate of parliamentary improvements which brought about many procedural refinements in the 1790s, Walsingham rapidly established an absolute ascendancy in the management of committee business. This was probably made easier by the fact that the most senior official in the chamber was his first cousin Henry Cowper, the clerk assistant. Within a few years he was chairing all but a handful of grand (of the whole house) and select (private bill) committees, which had the effect of ensuring that private parties could no longer secure the passage of self-interested legislation. Such was the assiduity and rigour with which he handled the committee stage of bills that it became common practice for those supervising legislative measures to seek his prior approval of them. Indeed, perhaps because of the absence of a Commons counterpart, this extended also to the lower house and in May 1796 he observed that &#145;they Send to me all private Bills whilst they are in the H<sup>e</sup>. Comm<sup>s</sup>., that I may suggest any alterations I think fit, lest such alterations should lose the Bill in the Comm<sup>ee</sup> of the Lords&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 38231, fol. 31).<br>
<br>Largely at Walsingham's suggestion, and reflecting his concern for what he privately and publicly termed the increasing &#145;weight of property&#146; requiring legislative consideration  (BL, Add. MS 58935, fols. 151&#150;2), his office was for the first time placed on a formal footing by resolution of the house on 23 July 1800, and his salary was raised to &pound;2500 per annum. He had a formidable reputation, not least for the inflexibility with which he applied his <i>de facto</i> policy of standardization in the drafting of statutes. He also attracted adverse criticism; a typical comment was Francis Horner's (in relation to the <span class="roman">Scottish Schoolmasters Bill</span> of 1807) that Walsingham &#145;is more strict than intelligent, and gives unnecessary vexation&#146;  (Horner, 464). Nevertheless, on his retirement on the grounds of ill health in November 1814, the House of Lords voted him a unanimous address of thanks, which praised his &#145;Ability, Integrity, Impartiality and indefatigable Industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 50.8), and recognized his enormous personal contribution, over a period of twenty years, to the process of scrutinizing&#151;particularly private&#151;legislation. He was granted a pension of &pound;2000 a year.<br>
<br>Walsingham, who in later life suffered badly from gout, died at Old Windsor on 16 January 1818 and was buried at Merton on the 30th. He was succeeded in his titles and estates by his two sons in turn: Lieutenant-General George de Grey, third Baron Walsingham (1776&#150;1831), who died with his wife in a fire at the family's London town house at 30 Upper Grosvenor Street, and the Revd Thomas de Grey, fourth Baron Walsingham (1778&#150;1839), who was archdeacon of Surrey.<br>
