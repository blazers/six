<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phipps,  Constantine Henry</span>, first marquess of Normanby  (1797&#150;1863), <span class="occ">politician and diplomatist</span>, was born on 15 May 1797, at Mulgrave Castle, Whitby, Yorkshire, first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22191/', "Henry Phipps, first earl of Mulgrave (1755&#150;1831)")</script>, and his wife, Martha Sophia Maling (<i>d</i>. 1849). Styled Viscount Normanby from 1812, he was educated at Harrow School (1811&#150;13) and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a nobleman in 1814, graduating MA in 1818. At the age of fourteen he was trained in debating by his father and while at Trinity College became president of the Cambridge Union (1815). Among other signs of precocity he became allured by the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1892/', "Eliza O'Neill, later Lady Wrixon-Becher (1791&#150;1872)")</script>, and after proposing marriage to her, was threatened with disinheritance by his father.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1818 Normanby married Maria (1798&#150;1882), eldest daughter of Thomas Henry Liddell, first Baron Ravensworth. She became a powerful whig hostess who partly inspired the character of Berengaria, Lady Montfort, in Disraeli's novel <span class="italic">Endymion</span>. Their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22190/', "George Augustus Constantine Phipps")</script>, was born a year after the marriage.<br>
<br>Normanby was elected tory MP for Scarborough in 1818. His first major speech (3 May 1819) urged Roman Catholic relief. As the son of a former cabinet minister he was expected to support the government but during the summer he joined the opposition. On 14 December he seconded a motion put by Lord John Russell in favour of parliamentary reform. These liberal views displeased his family, and in May 1820 he quitted parliament for Italy. There he wrote three volumes of stories published anonymously as <span class="italic">The English in Italy</span> (1825). By the 1830s Tuscany had become his adopted land: he bought a country villa there, rented boxes in the three principal Florentine theatres, provided amateur theatricals followed by sumptuous suppers, and enjoyed an intimacy with Grand Duke Leopold II, the mildest of the Italian rulers.<br>
<br>After his election as MP for Higham Ferrers in February 1822 Normanby became prominent among the advanced whigs. In 1826 he published pamphlets in support of Canning, and was elected for Malton, which he held until 1830. He next wrote <span class="italic">The English in France</span> (1828), &#145;a sketchy kind of book, composed of essays and tales, all intended to throw light upon France, painting it &amp; all it contains <i>en beau</i>&#146;, according to John Stuart Mill who observed &#145;there is much truth in the book, <i>though</i> not much depth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Earlier Letters</span>, 12.132). Normanby also wrote four romantic novels, <span class="italic">Matilda</span> (1825), <span class="italic">Yes and No</span> (1828), <span class="italic">Clorinda</span> (1829), and <span class="italic">The Contrast</span> (1832). These contain some wittily observed scenes, but his ideas were commonplace and his style almost gushing.<br>
<br>Having succeeded his father in the earldom in April 1831, Mulgrave was appointed governor of Jamaica in 1832, sworn to the privy council on 30 May, and was made a knight grand cross of the Royal Guelphic Order. When Jamaican slaves were emancipated in 1833 Mulgrave distributed compensation of &pound;19 per slave to their former owners. He also suppressed a rebellion. He resigned office in 1834 expecting cabinet preferment from Grey and was thought conceited for refusing the postmaster-generalship in June despite being &#145;so poor that any office would be of value&#146;  (<span class="italic">Elizabeth &hellip; to Her Son</span>, 149).<br>
<br>Mulgrave owed his appointment as lord privy seal in Melbourne's first cabinet (30 July 1834) to his charm: &#145;so eager, gay, pleasant &amp; good humoured&#146;, he seemed to Lady Holland in 1828  (<span class="italic">Elizabeth &hellip; to Her Son</span>, 78); and in 1834 Benjamin Haydon was delighted to find how &#145;little Phipps we used to play with&#146; had grown into &#145;a spirited and talented man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Pope, 4.193). When Melbourne appointed him as lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1835, Greville applauded the appointment: &#145;He has courage and firmness, and no want of ability. He is besides hospitable, generous, courteous and agreeable&#146;  (Greville, <span class="italic">King William IV</span>, 225&#150;6). Brougham, however, mocked the &#145;<i>impossible</i> transmutation of our <i>theatrical</i> and excellent friend Mulgrave into a Viceroy&#146;  (BL, Add. MS. 37311, fol. 258), and Wellesley resigned the lord chamberlainship in protest at the appointment. Mulgrave's arrival in Dublin on 11 May 1835 was welcomed by Roman Catholics. O'Connell declared that he was the best Englishman that Ireland had ever seen. Mulgrave liberated prisoners, discouraged the most offensive demonstrations of Orange bigotry, and controversially entertained O'Connell at Dublin Castle. Initially his social qualities captivated the Roman Catholic party, but Ireland could not be permanently disarmed by his smiles nor could he indefinitely sustain the cost of his charm offensive: &#145;Mulgrave has done very well in Ireland&#146;, Lord Durham noted in 1836, &#145;but I fear he is ruining himself by the expense&#146;  (Reid, 2.100&#150;01). Mulgrave was sincere in believing that the union could only be based upon equal rights. His manner became more grand and condescending during these viceregal years.<br>
<br>On the occasion of Queen Victoria's coronation, Mulgrave was created marquess of Normanby, on 25 June 1838. This promotion was evidence of the partiality in which he was held by Melbourne, for his Yorkshire estates were not extensive; only six other marquessates were created in her reign, of which four were held by viceroys of India.<br>
<br>In February 1839 Normanby was appointed secretary of state for war and the colonies. He was a businesslike administrator but relied on his under-secretary James Stephen in decision-taking. When in May 1839 the ministry was defeated over Jamaican policies in which he had been involved, Normanby in the midst of the so-called &#145;bedchamber crisis&#146; was summoned to Buckingham Palace by the queen and was considered &#145;a candidate for the premiership&#146;  (Parker, 2.405). This attention was perhaps instigated by his wife, who was a lady of the bedchamber; after Peel refused to take office unless she and Lady Morpeth were removed from their posts in the royal household, the whigs resumed office. Normanby, who was considered too weak for the Colonial Office, was transferred on 30 August 1839 to the Home Office&#151;a &#145;very bad and very foolish&#146; appointment, Wellington thought  (<span class="italic">Wellington and his Friends</span>, 122). Normanby remained home secretary until the fall of the ministry in September 1841.<br>
<br>Queen Victoria welcomed Normanby's appointment (August 1846) to the Paris embassy, for his brother Charles Phipps was her equerry, and private secretary to Prince Albert from the following year, and she hoped that Normanby would become &#145;a family Ambassador&#146;  (Longford, 188). Malmesbury and Derby indeed suspected that Normanby's course in Paris was guided by instructions from the prince consort. Though he was rewarded with the GCB (1847) and Garter (1851), his reputation began to decline and his misjudgements to proliferate once he undertook to decide questions of foreign policy. His posting began inauspiciously when the simultaneous marriages in October 1846 of the queen of Spain to the duke of Cadiz and of her sister to the duc de Montpensier destroyed the Anglo-French entente. Thereafter Normanby meddled in French politics. His intimacy with the opposition leader Thiers excited the opprobrium of the Parisian press in 1847, and imperilled harmony with King Louis-Philippe's chief minister, Guizot, who complained of him, &#145;Il est bon enfant, mais il ne comprend pas notre langue&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His precipitate, indiscreet, querulous, and blundering diplomacy provoked the Madrid ambassador, Lord Howden, to say &#145;that Normanby was like the month of March&#151;coming in like a lion and going out like a lamb&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.66). Victor Hugo described him in 1847 as &#145;tall, fair, with an extremely English appearance&#151;he could scarcely look more English&#151;elegant, graceful, high-bred, good-natured and dandyish&#146;  (Hugo, 117). Normanby was in Paris during the disturbances of 1848, and in 1857 published his putative journal of <span class="italic">A Year of Revolution</span>, which in fact relies on his official dispatches. Despite Palmerston's support for Normanby in 1847, the two men diverged in their attitudes to the Bonapartists and quarrelled in December 1851 over Palmerston's hasty recognition of Louis Napoleon's <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>; Normanby's brother Charles Phipps put his complaints before Queen Victoria, thus ensuring Palmerston's dismissal. In February 1852 Normanby retired from Paris as a result of his estrangement from the Russell administration. Charles Greville commented, &#145;His vanity is very amusing, for he talks of his great influence &hellip; when everybody knows that there was never an Ambassador so generally disliked and despised&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.445&#150;6). While in Paris, Normanby had a liaison with an actress, Louise-Agathe Beaudouin (1819&#150;1894), who was usually known by her stage name, Atala Beauch&ecirc;ne.<br>
<br>In December 1854 Normanby was appointed as minister to the courts of Tuscany, Modena, and Parma. In addition to his Tuscan country house, he now rented the Palazzo San Clemente in Florence, once the residence of the Young Pretender. Lord Redesdale describes him at this time &#145;fussing and fuming&#146; with &#145;pomposity&#146;  (Redesdale, 1.136)&#151;a sad contrast to &#145;that light, squally vessel Lord Mulgrave&#146; who had delighted Lady Granville in 1835  (Leveson-Gower, 190). Normanby's local meddling and Austrian sympathies vexed successive foreign secretaries until he was abruptly recalled by telegraph in April 1858. He then reverted to his family's traditional tory allegiance and was considered ungrateful in his conduct to former colleagues.<br>
<br>In youth Normanby was handsome with dark romantic curls, but he was worn and haggard by the 1850s. Such an effective debater when young, he was partly inaudible in his speeches and motions in the Lords against Italian unification and French policy towards Savoy (24 and 27 January, 7 February 1860). Shortly afterwards, he was disabled by paralysis (like his father before him), and he died on 28 July 1863 at Hamilton Lodge, 9 Kensington Gore, London. He was buried on 5 August at St Oswald's, Lythe, near Whitby. &#145;Lord Normanby was one of the men who are clever boys and nothing more. There was, in his early life, a promise of excellence, both literary and political, but the promise has never been fulfilled&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 150).<br>
