<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Howard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dacre]</span>,  Anne</span>, countess of Arundel  (1557&#150;1630), <span class="occ">noblewoman and priest harbourer</span>, was born in Carlisle on 1 March 1557, the eldest daughter of Thomas Dacre, fourth Lord Dacre of Gilsland (1526?&#150;1566), and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1567), daughter of Sir James Leybourn of Cunswick, Westmorland. Her brother, George, sometimes called Francis, was born in 1562, then two sisters followed: Mary, born in 1563, and Elizabeth, born in 1564. Her father died two years later, and in January 1567 her mother became the third wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13941/', "Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk (1538&#150;1572)")</script>. Within a year she died in childbirth.<h2>
<a name="Upbringingandmarriage"></a>Upbringing and marriage</h2>The children's upbringing was largely in the hands of their grandmother, Lady Mounteagle, formerly married to Sir James Leybourn. She was responsible for the children of her two daughters, Anne, the elder, who married the son of her second husband, and the younger, Elizabeth. Lady Mounteagle was a devout Catholic, and in her care the children were instructed by a Catholic priest. Lady Montague, sister of Lord Dacre, was also a member of this Catholic group, whose influence was balanced by the presence in the duke's household of his sister, Lady Westmorland, a fervent protestant. Following a visit to Oxford in 1568 the duke introduced Gregory Martin as tutor, although after the great Norfolk house at Kenninghall was closed in 1570 Martin left for the continent and was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1573. A protestant tutor took his place. As a child Anne showed no inclination to follow the Catholicism of her grandmother and mother.<br>
<br>After much difficulty the duke obtained the wardship of the four Dacre children. He planned that George should marry Margaret, daughter of his second wife, Margaret Audley, and that the three girls should marry his three sons: Philip, his heir, son of Mary Fitzalan, daughter of Henry, earl of Arundel; and Thomas and William, sons of Margaret Audley. George, who had succeeded as Lord Dacre, was killed in 1569 by a fall from a vaulting horse, a wooden structure designed to teach young riders to leap on to their mounts. Margaret Howard, a particular favourite of Anne, married instead Robert Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, later earl of Dorset. The three girls duly married the three sons of the duke.<br>
<br>Anne was first married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13929/', "Philip Howard (1557&#150;1595)")</script> in a ceremony in 1569, when both were twelve. It was repeated two years later after they had reached the age of consent and the duke, then a prisoner in the Tower, had made a bargain with the earl of Arundel that a portion of his inheritance would be advanced to Philip, held in trust until he was twenty-five. Styled earl of Surrey, Philip would succeed to the title of earl of Arundel. Anne, coheir with her sister Elizabeth, inherited extensive Dacre lands, including the estates of Gilsland and Greystoke, nine baronies, and manors in many counties.<br>
<br>The duke showed himself a fond father to the children, and one of his last letters, directed to all of them in January 1572, when he daily expected execution, expresses his love and deep concern for Philip and Anne. He urges Philip to &#145;love and make much of your wife&#146;, speaking of her as &#145;endued with so great towardness in resolve and good qualities and in person comparable with the best sort&#146;. When he writes to her directly, he calls her his &#145;well-beloved Nann, that hath been as dear to me as if you had been mine own daughter&#146;, committing to her care his only daughter, Margaret  (Williams, 239, 243&#150;4).<h2>
<a name="Domesticproblems"></a>Domestic problems</h2>Norfolk's fears that Philip would prove unworthy were justified all too soon. After some years at Cambridge, where his conduct was as reprehensible as that of any young irresponsible nobleman, he presented himself at court, striving to gain the favour of the queen. Meanwhile Anne was entirely neglected. Unsettling moves, from Audley End to Arundel House, London, to Nonsuch, with occasional visits to the Charterhouse, then known as Howard House, occurred frequently for many years. By the early 1580s she was at Arundel Castle in Sussex, and there she was converted to Catholicism, received by a Marian priest to whom she was brought by one of Philip Howard's servants, Richard Bayly. Lady Margaret Sackville also became a Catholic about this time. Philip showed no displeasure; out of favour at court and hurt by the apparent coldness of the queen, he returned to the country and joined his wife. The queen, however, expressed strong disapproval, and ordered Anne to the house of Sir Thomas Shirley at Wiston, Sussex, where her first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1583. She was forced to remain there for about a year, writing pitifully to Sir Francis Walsingham on 10 June 1584 for release from &#145;my unfortunate estate&#146;  (copy, Arundel Castle Archives, MD 2734).<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1584 Philip was converted to Roman Catholicism by the Jesuit William Weston. The queen's suspicions led to his house arrest, and when her fears were confirmed in 1585 on his attempt to escape to France, he was captured at sea and committed to the Tower. He was tried in Star Chamber and condemned to indefinite imprisonment, with a fine of &pound;10,000. From this time the queen's behaviour towards both Philip and Anne was spiteful and mean. Refused permission to live in London, Anne rented a house in Romford, Essex. On 7 July 1585 her son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13943/', "Thomas Howard, the future fourteenth earl of Arundel")</script>, was born in the parsonage of Finchingfield, Essex, a house that had been granted to the third duke of Norfolk by Henry VIII. Philip was told that the child was another daughter, and although he discovered that he had a son, he never saw the child or his wife again.<h2>
<a name="Povertyandwidowhood"></a>Poverty and widowhood</h2>After Philip's imprisonment, and on the urging of Thomas Morgan, her agent in France, Mary, queen of Scots, wrote to Anne to praise the constancy in religion the Howards showed. She expressed her willingness to act in order to secure the release of the earl &#145;who is so dear to me&#146;, but was afraid that her motives would be wrongly interpreted. She enclosed letters addressed to her friends in Scotland, and asked Anne to forward them through her &#145;friends and servants upon the borders&#146; and to receive answers, a correspondence that was to be secret  (Walter, 2.256). There were letters also to Lord Henry Howard, Philip's uncle, and to Lady Cobham. She could apparently rely upon a close friendship with Anne, whom she addressed as &#145;cousin&#146;, for she asked her to purchase silks or velvets sufficient for two gowns for Lady Cobham, leaving the gift to Anne's discretion. The letter was to be delivered by means of the French ambassador, and replies sent by the same route. At this time of such tension it would have been most unwise if Anne had allowed herself to be enmeshed in Mary's political machinations.<br>
<br>In 1588 Anne was living in a wing of Arundel House, for which she paid a lease of &pound;30 a year. When Queen Elizabeth wished to visit Somerset House, next door to the property, Anne was required to vacate it.<br>
<br>Philip's ordeal was intensified when he was accused of arranging a mass to be said on behalf of the Spanish forces at the time of the Armada. He was tried for treason and condemned to death. Execution was postponed, but his close imprisonment continued until his death on 19 October 1595, not without suspicion of poison. His lands and those of his wife were attainted. Arundel House was searched, and most of the furniture carried away. For some time Anne took refuge in small houses, one in Spitalfields and one in Acton. Reduced to a meagre &pound;8 pension a week, irregularly received, she sold jewels to pay her remaining servants and, deprived of her coach, she was forced to walk. Her state seemed to her like penury. Her grandson William Howard, writing the life of his father, describes the difficulties she suffered:<blockquote>all her estate beinge taken from her, and a very small allowance allowed her, hardly enough to kepe her selfe and children, much lesse to bee able to give her sonne such breedinge, as was fitte for a personne of his qualety, during the Queenes rayne. (Hervey, appx 3, 463)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Religiousdevotionmaterialrecovery"></a>Religious devotion, material recovery</h2>Throughout these years the countess called upon the services of Catholic priests. Martin Array, a seminary priest, was her chaplain until his arrest in June 1586 and banishment a month later. Within a few months the Jesuit Robert Southwell entered her household. He acted also as spiritual adviser to the earl, with whom he exchanged letters, the basis of the lengthy prose study <span class="italic">An Epistle of Comfort</span>. The volume was printed on a press set up in one of the countess's houses, probably that in Spitalfields, where the Jesuit John Gerard saw it in 1588. Southwell understood the difficulties faced by the countess in establishing a religious life. For her he wrote &#145;A shorte rule of good life&#146;, a simple statement of faith and a guide to everyday living. It is a directive for a devout laywoman of high rank and, like the Ignatian <span class="italic">Spiritual Exercises</span>, is a flexible outline, expressed in the first person, to be enlarged according to changing circumstances. The countess followed the &#145;Rule&#146; for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>In 1592 Southwell was captured after he had left the comparative security of the countess's house. She tried to alleviate the conditions in which he was held by sending him books and necessaries through his sister, Mary Bannister. He was executed on 21 February 1595, a few months before Philip Howard died. The countess's hopes for her children had to be abandoned. In 1598 her daughter, Elizabeth, died of tuberculosis. As he grew older, she was forced to relinquish the direction of Thomas's education. An early biographer states that he attended Westminster School, and passed on to Cambridge, after which he travelled abroad.<br>
<br>The possessions that should have come to Anne after the death of her husband were withheld. In her financial affairs she was guided by her steward, Robert Spiller, who served her for more than forty years before his death in 1615. When he first undertook the task, she had debts of &pound;14,000 as a result of her husband's free-spending at court. She eventually had to pay &pound;10,000 for lands designated as her jointure. In 1599 and again in 1602 she sold lands in order to secure an income. In 1601 John Hobart, a Norfolk man and an agent for the marquess of Winchester, tried to arrange a loan for the countess and her brother-in-law Lord William Howard so that they might make composition to the queen for Lord Dacre's lands. The baronies of Gilsland and Greystoke finally became her property by an instruction given to the attorney-general, probably in 1603. In 1607 she recovered Arundel House, although forced to pay &pound;4000 to Charles Howard, earl of Nottingham, who had claimed it quite unjustifiably.<br>
<br>As she regained the property due to her as her inheritance and her jointure, Anne was also able to secure a place in society for her son. At the new year's festivities in 1606 both the countess and Thomas made gifts of &pound;20 to the king, who responded with a gift of 30 ounces of &#145;guilt plate&#146;. That summer Thomas married Aletheia (<i>d</i>. 1654), youngest daughter and coheir of Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94252/', "Howard, Aletheia, countess of Arundel")</script>], a match brokered by John Hobart, who proposed it to the countess of Shrewsbury.<h2>
<a name="PillarofCatholicism"></a>Pillar of Catholicism</h2>Anne's admiration for the Society of Jesus was shown in 1612 when she made a gift of &pound;2500 to the Jesuit Richard Blount, then serving in England. She hoped that the sum would be invested and the interest compounded until she died, but the money was mishandled and lost. An even more significant gift was made in 1621, when she founded the tertianship in Ghent. If ever England again embraced Catholicism, the house was to move to Carlisle, where she was born. For the last fourteen years before her death the countess maintained a Jesuit priest who wrote accounts of her life and that of the earl. &#145;The life of the right honourable and virtuouse lady, the Lady Anne late countesse of Arundell and Surrey&#146; has an intimacy that could arise only after many years' observation. The manuscript work is clearly a compilation of reminiscences, some of which represent her attempts to recall early stages in her life, while others record the day-to-day life in her household, when she practised a disciplined and practical piety. Events are overlaid with the emotions that remained with the countess, as in the account &#145;Of the Queen's hatred towards Her&#146;  (&#145;Life of &hellip; the Lady Anne&#146;, chap. 6) and in her thankfulness that Southwell came to live with her as the result of a misunderstanding, admitted some years afterwards &#145;in pleasant discourse&#146;  (ibid., chap. 7). The death of the earl was followed by a period of intense mourning and of physical suffering, when, against the advice of Lady Montague, she took a vow of chastity, regularly renewed. The writer admires her for her &#145;vertuous, modest and discreet&#146; behaviour, and notes that &#145;altho there wanted not many that did not much care for her naturally speaking, yet none were ever hear'd to speak one evil word of her&#146;  (ibid., chap. 8).<br>
<br>The account is made up of frequent anecdotes, including the story of the plan Anne made to rescue George Blackwell, the arch-priest, when he had hidden for three days in a house that was closely watched. She not only provided a substantial bribe for the officer in charge, but sent him a venison pie every year on twelfth night, the anniversary. Not unexpectedly, she was deeply hurt by her son's submission to the Church of England. The explanation given by her biographer is that &#145;partly through fear, partly through desire of the King's favour (meeting with some bad counsellors) he accommodated himself by degrees to the times more than he ought to have done&#146;. In no way did she change her affection for him, but &#145;I and others&#146; heard her say that she would welcome the news of his death if &#145;she might have good hopes of his salvation&#146;  (&#145;Life of &hellip; the Lady Anne&#146;, chap. 12). She was indeed able to rejoice at the deaths of those who died in the old faith. When her eldest grandson, James, died in 1623 of smallpox in Ghent, reconciled by John Gerard, she felt that his good death was a sign of God's approval of the Jesuit house she had founded there, and similarly when her grandson Charles died in her care aged about seven, she was said to have exclaimed aloud of her joy that he had gone to heaven  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>In advanced age Anne spent much of the day in attendance in the chapel and in other religious observances. She oversaw the preparation of medicines and dressings, and many came to her seeking treatment. She had obtained a relic, a bone from one of Southwell's feet, and was said to effect cures by its powers. (At her death it was left to Richard Blount, the Jesuit provincial.) She was extremely generous, giving alms to all kinds of people in need, distributing food three times a week, sometimes to &#145;well nigh a Hundred&#146;, and paying pensions, and also (remembering her northern origins) supplying a quantity of woollen cloth from her northern estates and providing a salary for a schoolmaster in Cumberland. She made great occasions of the birthdays of her three great-grandchildren. When the eldest was three, shortly before her death, she entertained &#145;almost eight score poor Children&#146;, giving each a herring pie (since it was Lent) and three pennies  (&#145;Life of &hellip; the Lady Anne&#146;, chap. 10).<br>
<br>The admiration expressed by Anne's biographer extends to her appearance. Those who knew her when she was young reported that she was fair and beautiful, and she still retained a fresh colour. She was tall, and towards the end of her life was &#145;something corpulent&#146;, a state that might have set off her grace and dignity, but she would do nothing out of vanity. She wore simple black gowns of inexpensive material, with a piece of religious jewellery on festival occasions. The rather unperceptive chaplain found it hard to see that she ever made any change, &#145;the new being so like the old in all respects&#146;  (&#145;Life of &hellip; the Lady Anne&#146;, chap. 17). He records that a portrait was sent to Philip III of Spain and was hung in the Escorial  (ibid., chap. 16), but it can no longer be found. When she was sixty-nine, drawings were made by Lucas Vorsterman: one is preserved in the British Museum, and another was later engraved by Wenceslaus Hollar, of which several copies survive.<br>
<br>During the period when her biographer lived with her the countess moved four times. For the last two years of her life she was at the manor house at Shifnal, Shropshire. She appears to have had such confidence in her chaplain that he was present at the making of her will, and he records that having had the usual legacies to her family and close friends written out for her, she wrote in her own hand a number of particular bequests. After more than six months' decline she became so weak that she could no longer attend chapel. She was visited by Thomas Howard and his wife and children, and by others to whom the reader is told&#151;with perhaps a touch of irony&#151;she gave her last advice and counsel. She died quietly at Shifnal on 13 April 1630 and was buried in the Fitzalan Chapel, Arundel Castle.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>The countess's biographer finished his work on 15 June 1635, meticulously recording the years, months, and days after her death. Two manuscript copies are preserved at Arundel Castle. The earlier, in octavo, probably dates from the mid-seventeenth century and includes material omitted from the other copy in quarto. A printed version, with many abridgements, was edited by the duke of Norfolk in 1857. The manuscripts vary so much in details of style that the biography may have been written originally in Latin, to be sent to Rome.<br>
<br>Although the work is hagiography, from it there emerges a vivid picture of a woman of extraordinary strength and endurance, recalling the past and re-creating in the present a useful, busy, and ordered life out of the public eye. Other sources reveal how watchful she was over her son and his family, whose fluctuating fortunes continued to bring her anxiety. She worked so diligently to recover her lands that it was said at her death that she left Thomas Howard an income of &pound;6000. In her faith she was greatly sustained by the directive prepared for her by Robert Southwell. She was indeed an exemplar of a Catholic woman of rank whose piety and charity helped to keep Catholicism alive in England.<br>
