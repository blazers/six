<span class="headword">Colenso,  Harriette Emily</span>  (1847&#150;1932), <span class="occ">missionary and political activist</span>, was born on 30 June 1847 at Tharston, Norfolk, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5875/', "John William Colenso (1814&#150;1883)")</script>, first bishop of Natal, and his wife, (Sarah) Frances Bunyon (1816&#150;1893). She had two sisters and two brothers. Her sister <a name="cosubject_5874"></a><span class="headword">Frances Ellen Colenso</span>  (1849&#150;1887)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 30 May 1849 at Forncett, also in Norfolk. The youngest child of the family, Agnes Mary (1855&#150;1932), became Harriette's lifelong stalwart supporter; her brothers Robert John (1850&#150;1926) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95487/', "Francis Ernest (Frank) Colenso, (1852&#150;1910)")</script> became a doctor and an actuary respectively. Both settled in England, but Frank continued to give unstinting support to his sisters in their controversies.<br>
<br>Harriette Colenso's appearance was pleasing, and she could be charming and humorous as well as strident and cutting. Her youth was spent at Forncett and Bishopstowe (Ekukanyeni), the estate granted to her father about 5 miles outside Pietermaritzburg, Natal. She became a fluent Zulu linguist. With her sisters, she was a pupil at Winnington Hall, Cheshire, during the early 1860s, when Bishop Colenso&#151;then at the centre of theological controversy&#151;returned with his family to Britain.<br>
<br>Frances Ellen Colenso probably responded more warmly than her sisters to the literary and cultural impulses that the young Colensos experienced in these years. She also attended Winnington Hall (<i>c</i>.1862&#150;1864) and subsequently studied at the Slade School of Art in London. She enjoyed the friendship of Georgiana Burne-Jones, wife of the painter. Although an aspiring artist, she was also the author of works of fiction and literary sketches. Her best-known works, however, were <span class="italic">My Chief and I</span> (published in 1880, but&#151;apart from a sequel&#151;written earlier) and the <span class="italic">History of the Zulu Wars</span> (1880), which were intended to support her father's criticism of official policy and to defend the reputation of Colonel Anthony Durnford, the man whom she could not marry because he was already caught in an unhappy marriage. Durnford was blamed by Natal colonists for the death of colonial volunteers in the skirmish at the Bushman's River pass in 1873; later, Chelmsford made him the scapegoat for the British disaster at Isandlwana.<br>
<br>Harriette Colenso remained uninterruptedly in Natal between 1864 and 1890, although all her siblings either visited Britain again or were educated there. In addition to her responsibilities on the mission station, she accompanied her father on his diocesan visits in Natal and when he went to Grahamstown and Cape Town in 1880. She served a vigorous apprenticeship in political controversy when she assisted her father over the Langalibalele affair.<br>
<br>On the death of Bishop Colenso in June 1883, Harriette Colenso became the acknowledged family leader: when fire destroyed their home in September 1884, it was she who decided the Colenso women would remain at Bishopstowe, living in a farm cottage. She also took over her father's role of advising Frances Ellen in her political writings, helping in the production of the massive and ill-digested two volumes of <span class="italic">The Ruin of Zululand</span> (1884&#150;5), and supervising the family collaboration with &#145;Sir&#146; George Cox over the <span class="italic">Life of Bishop Colenso</span> (1888&#150;9). Neither work was well received. After suffering for several years from consumption, Frances Ellen died on 28 April 1887 in lodgings at Ventnor in the Isle of Wight, perhaps of a heart attack. The family grieved, but emphasized the causes she had championed.<br>
<br>Like her father after 1873, Harriette Colenso was bitterly opposed to arbitrary white authority over the black population of Natal, and she undertook decades of controversy on behalf of the Zulu people. During this period Zulu land was partitioned (1886), and part was annexed to Britain as a crown colony. In 1897 the white-dominated colony of Natal incorporated this previously separate colony of Zululand.<br>
<br>Harriette Colenso condemned policies hostile to Zulu cohesion. She supported Dinizulu ka Cetshwayo, as the son of the man her father befriended, and hoped that Britain (later Natal) would acknowledge and guide his leadership of a cohesive Zulu nation. During many Zulu crises, Harriette's voluminous letters, <i>inter alia</i> to the Aborigines Protection Society, her use of the Bishopstowe press, and her political pamphlets (some far from models of clarity) were evidence of her commitment. She twice visited Britain in the 1890s to appeal to the Colonial Office, address varied audiences, and lobby parliamentarians. She later gave evidence to important government commissions of inquiry and was well known to some of the early leaders of the African National Congress. She was the lifelong friend of Alice Werner, whose interest in African languages Harriette confirmed.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, the Zulu people lost more and more land. Dinizulu was twice arraigned before special&#151;and suspect&#151;courts in 1888&#150;9 and 1908&#150;9. After conviction at Eshowe in 1889, Dinizulu and two uncles were sent to St Helena, where Harriette Colenso twice visited them. When they were repatriated in 1898, she accompanied them. Dinizulu was arrested again in 1907 after the Bambatha uprising and sentenced to imprisonment for harbouring dependants of a rebel leader. At both trials Harriette devoted money, energy, intellect, and legal acumen to the defence, attended the court proceedings assiduously, and encouraged appeals to Britain. In 1910 Louis Botha, first prime minister of the Union of South Africa, freed Dinizulu shortly after the Union of South Africa was constituted. Dinizulu was not allowed to return to Zululand but located near Middelburg in the Transvaal, where Harriette Colenso visited him.<br>
<br>Harriette Colenso believed she had the support of the &#145;better part&#146; of the Natal colonists. Influenced by Harry Escombe, future prime minister of Natal, she supported responsible government for Natal and in January 1895 she telegraphed to London her view that the annexation of Zululand to Natal should precede the exiles' return. Harriette was later disappointed by Escombe but did not quarrel with him. When he died in 1899, she sought the goodwill of other Natal politicians. In 1908 a white audience in Pietermaritzburg listened to her ideas on &#145;native policy&#146; with respect, but most white Natalians were hostile and contemptuous.<br>
<br>For most of their lives Harriette and Agnes Colenso lived at Bishopstowe, where they continued the mission. They held services, conducted a school, and republished some of their father's works of special value to missions. In 1899 they rebuilt a house (now a national monument) on the ruins of the old home and were living there when their brother Frank visited them in 1900.<br>
<br>Through decades of bitter ecclesiastical controversy between rival Anglican groups, Harriette Colenso fought hard to secure the survival of the Church of England in Natal. In 1886 she persuaded leading laymen to select &#145;Sir&#146; George Cox as Colenso's successor, but Cox was denied consecration. William Ayerst was then chosen, but he, too, was not consecrated. Harriette Colenso had nothing to do with the selection of Ayerst, but she had much to do with the opposition to Arthur Hamilton Baynes, chosen by the archbishop of Canterbury to reconcile the divided Anglicans of Natal. Harriette argued that, because Baynes had signed the constitution of the Church of the Province of South Africa, he should not be accepted as bishop of the Church of England. The church council of the Church of England agreed with her, but Baynes and his successor won over the separate vestries of individual congregations. In October 1897 even St Peter's, Colenso's own cathedral, reached an agreement with the Church of the Province of South Africa. Harriette subsequently interrupted a service to make a public protest and then withdrew.<br>
<br>Until 1910 judicial decisions of the 1880s denied the Church of the Province control of church property. Legislation was necessary, but attempts to have laws enacted failed in 1898 and&#151;after vigorous contention&#151;in 1903. When, in 1909, yet another bill was brought before the Natal parliament, Harriette Colenso urged and organized resistance. She attended the sessions of the Natal parliament and would have addressed the upper house if given timely opportunity. Nevertheless, the bill was passed in Natal and accepted by the British government as the <span class="roman">Church Properties Act</span> of 1910. In terms of this law each Colenso sister was allowed an annual pension of &pound;150. Harriette thought this a politically motivated sop to conscience. She applied unsuccessfully to the courts to compel the Church of the Province of South Africa to pay a pension to Moses Sibisi, the catechist of St Mary's, the &#145;native&#146; church in Pietermaritzburg where the Colensos worshipped. When the Colenso women and the Bishopstowe tenants were evicted, the Church of the Province sold off the land in individual plots to German settlers.<br>
<br>Harriette Colenso thought of moving near the exiled Dinizulu but instead lived first in central Pietermaritzburg and then at Sweetwaters. Dinizulu died in 1913. Harriette attended the obsequies and helped influence the choice of his heir. Though disquieted by the possible direction of Union policy, she realized that she could no longer undertake what she might previously have attempted. The Colensos' own household of retainers and black children absorbed much attention. Harriette and Agnes Colenso occasionally visited Durban to keep in touch with Christ Church, Addington, which had not joined the Church of the Province of South Africa. Harriette was always concerned for the black congregations that maintained the Colenso connection and was in touch with other black pastors. When the prince of Wales visited Pietermaritzburg in 1925, the sisters attended the racecourse gathering of black people. The only whites present, they were greeted affectionately by sons of men they had befriended. As they grew older and more frail, they withdrew more and more from white society. They both died in 1932 at Sweetwaters, Harriette on 2 June and Agnes a few weeks later on 23 July. They were buried alongside their mother in the cemetery in Pietermaritzburg.<br>
<br>There are many difficulties in assessing the role of the Colenso sisters. Radical historians are impatient of white missionaries, and it is disconcerting for the Church of the Province of South Africa, so vigorously critical of twentieth-century apartheid, to recall what was shabby in the way the Colensos were treated earlier. In addition, current political perspectives blur the image of the Colensos, especially Harriette: Zulu loyalists appear reluctant to recognize the role of a white woman in fostering Zulu nationality. On the other hand, opponents of political movements based on ethnicity are uneasy about the way the Colensos praised Zulu national identity. In their own view the Colensos were simply loyal to their father's memory and his commitment &#145;to love righteousness and deal justly&#146;. Harriette's best-known Zulu name, uDhledhlwe (&#145;walking stick&#146;), marked her devoted support of all her father stood for.<br>
