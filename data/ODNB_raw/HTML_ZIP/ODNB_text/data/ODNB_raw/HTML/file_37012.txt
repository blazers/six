<span class="headword">Woods,  Henry</span>  (1868&#150;1952), <span class="occ">palaeontologist</span>, was born on 18 December 1868 at Cottenham, near Cambridge, the only child of Francis Woods, a farmer, and his second wife, Mary Ann Granger, daughter of a Haddenham farmer. His father died when he was two years old. He was educated at the village school and, following a move with his mother in 1880, at the higher grade school in Cambridge. Although he gained several prizes and a scholarship, he left in 1883 to start work, but continued to study in his spare time. On entering St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1887 he proved to be a brilliant student. He gained a first class in part one of the natural sciences tripos in 1889, and was elected a scholar; obtaining a first class in part two of the tripos, the following year, taking geology, he was awarded the Harkness scholarship for the best performance in the examination. He took his MA in 1894 and won the Sedgwick prize in 1895.<br>
<br>Woods joined the teaching staff of the department of geology, Cambridge University, in 1892, filling a new post of demonstrator in palaeobotany. In 1894 he also became demonstrator in palaeozoology, and in 1899 he was appointed to the first lectureship in palaeozoology&#151;a post he held until his retirement in 1934. His connections with the department lasted almost to the end of his life, and he continued to act as librarian until past the age of eighty.<br>
<br>Prior to his official appointment Woods had been working on the palaeontological collections in the department  (Bulman, 645), and had published <span class="italic">A Catalogue of Type Fossils in the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge</span> in 1891. He devoted considerable time to the collections until a full-time curator was appointed (in the 1920s). Woods was also involved in planning the new Sedgwick Museum with Professor McKenny Hughes, and on its completion in 1904 became responsible for its arrangement. A zealous teacher, he produced the fundamental treatise <span class="italic">Palaeontology: Invertebrate</span> (1893) from his lecture notes; this textbook went through numerous editions until its concentration on basic morphological facts, reflecting Woods's cautious attitude to the philosophical and interpretative aspects of palaeontology, meant that it was superseded by more modern works.<br>
<br>In 1910 Woods married Ethel Gertrude Skeat (<i>d</i>. 1939), the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36116/', "Walter William Skeat")</script>, professor of Old English at Cambridge. In 1908 she was awarded the Murchison fund by the Geological Society in recognition of her various contributions to palaeontology. She and Woods had no children.<br>
<br>Woods's original contributions established him as one of the foremost invertebrate palaeontologists of his generation. His <span class="italic">Monograph of the Cretaceous Lamellibranchia of England</span> (1899&#150;1913) was still a fundamental reference at the close of the twentieth century. His meticulous observations and clear morphological descriptions, combined with a thorough comparison of the relationship of contemporaneous taxa, and a high standard of illustration, have ensured its lasting importance. His equally precise <span class="italic">Monograph of the Fossil Macrurous Crustacea of England</span> (1925&#150;31) deals with a less abundant group, but has an identical status in modern taxonomy. Woods published other significant descriptive monographs on Cretaceous Mollusca from South Africa (1906, 1908), New Zealand (1917), and Northern Nigeria (1911), and one on Tertiary Mollusca from Peru (1922).<br>
<br>Woods was usually reluctant to indulge in speculative hypothesis, but one of his earlier papers on the supposed evolution of the Cretaceous bivalve <i>Inoceramus</i> had a major role in establishing the importance of the Inoceramidae during that period. His earlier analysis of the chalk rock fauna (1896&#150;7) modified contemporary opinion on chalk deposition and compares with more recent palaeoecological interpretation. He must be regarded as unique in that, despite publishing many systematic descriptions, he only created a single taxon at supra-specific level, the bivalve sub-genus <i>Cucullaea</i> (<i>Dicranodonta</i>), in 1899.<br>
<br>Tall and spare, with a pronounced stoop in later life, Woods had a quiet, reserved manner, tempered by his kindly grey eyes. The only available portrait of him is a passport photograph, confirming both his liking for travel and his self-confessed, unsociable, shy disposition. Although not a dynamic personality, or an outstanding lecturer, he instilled a love of fossils into many of his students.<br>
<br>The Geological Society of London awarded Woods the Lyell fund (1898), the Lyell medal (1918), and the Wollaston medal (1940). He was elected FRS in 1916, was a member of the Geologists' Association for sixty years, and was made an honorary member of the Royal Society of New Zealand, and of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, for his work on Cretaceous fossils. Owing to financial necessity, he became a most practised and efficient examiner for many of the principal examination authorities. He served on the councils of both the Palaeontographical and the Geological societies. But apart from his work, his only other interest was gardening.<br>
<br>After a short illness Woods died on 4 April 1952 at his home, The Homestead, Meldreth, Cambridgeshire, where he had lived since 1924. Precise and methodical to the end, he bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the Palaeontographical Society and the Geological Society.<br>
