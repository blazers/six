</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bragg, Sir  (William) Lawrence</span>  (1890&#150;1971), <span class="occ">physicist and crystallographer</span>, was born on 31 March 1890 at 58/60 Lefevre Terrace, Adelaide, Australia, the elder son (the younger, Robert, was killed at Gallipoli in 1915) and eldest of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32031/', "Sir William Henry Bragg (1862&#150;1942)")</script>, physicist, and his wife, Gwendoline (1869&#150;1929), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36530/', "Sir Charles Todd")</script>, government astronomer of South Australia.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Bragg was educated in Adelaide at Convent School (1895&#150;7), at Queen's preparatory school (1898&#150;1901), and at St Peter's College, Adelaide, the leading Church of England school in South Australia (1901&#150;5). Always ahead of his age group he left school at fifteen to enter the University of Adelaide, in 1905, where he read mathematics, with subsidiary courses in physics and chemistry, in his father's department. He graduated with first-class honours in mathematics in 1908. Most of his tuition was from his father: he had a desk in his office and was drawn into detailed discussion of his father's developing research work on the nature of X-rays.<br>
<br>In 1909 Bragg's family moved to England, where his father had been appointed professor of physics at Leeds University, and Bragg entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He read part one of the mathematical tripos (first class, 1910) and part two of the natural sciences tripos (physics), graduating in 1912 with first-class honours.<h2>
<a name="ResearchmarriageandchairatManchester19121937"></a>Research, marriage, and chair at Manchester, 1912&#150;1937</h2>In the summer of 1912 Friedrich, Knipping, and Laue in Munich discovered the diffraction of X-rays by crystals and in the autumn of that year Bragg showed, first, that the phenomenon can be simply understood in terms of the reflection of X-ray waves by planes of atoms in the crystals (according to Bragg's law) and, second, that the observed effects are capable of revealing the detailed arrangements of the atoms in the crystals. In this single piece of work, which was described to a meeting of the Cambridge Philosophical Society on 11 November 1912, he opened the way to the detailed study of the wave nature of X-rays and, at the same time, began the X-ray analysis of crystal structures that has since revealed the arrangement of the atoms in all kinds of substances from the chemical elements to viruses. Both of these new opportunities for research were quickly exploited. His demonstration of X-ray reflection from mica in December 1912 led immediately to his father's development of the X-ray spectrometer, and the discovery that each element emits a characteristic X-ray spectrum of definite wavelengths; this led in turn to the discovery of the atomic numbers of the elements by H. G. J. Moseley. At the same time Bragg himself quickly determined the atomic arrangements in sodium and potassium chloride in a study described as &#145;the great breakthrough to actual crystal-structure determination and to the absolute measurement of X-ray wavelengths&#146;  (Ewald, 69).<br>
<br>The X-ray spectrometer provided a more powerful method of analysing crystal structures than Laue photographs and Bragg worked in Leeds during the summer of 1913, using the instrument to analyse a number of mineral structures while his father concentrated mainly on spectroscopic studies of the X-rays. Together they determined the structure of diamond. For this body of work, described in <span class="italic">X-Rays and Crystal Structure</span> (1915), written by Bragg in collaboration with his father, they were jointly awarded the Nobel prize for physics in 1915. Aged twenty-five at the time, Bragg was still known as the youngest ever Nobel prizewinner two decades after his death.<br>
<br>Bragg served throughout the First World War, first in the Leicestershire Royal Horse Artillery and then, from August 1915, as officer in charge of sound ranging, a method of locating enemy guns from the sound of their firing. He was awarded the MC (1918), appointed OBE (1918), mentioned in dispatches three times, and rose to the rank of major.<br>
<br>In 1919 Bragg returned briefly to the lectureship and fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, to which he had been appointed in 1914, but left for Manchester in the autumn, where he had been appointed Langworthy professor of physics in succession to Sir E. Rutherford. There he created the leading school of crystallography, to some degree in competition with his father who established another school at the Royal Institution. They seem to have agreed that Bragg should study metals and minerals, and crystal physics more generally, while his father concentrated on organic structures.<br>
<br>In 1921 Bragg was elected FRS and in December that year he married Alice Grace Jenny, the daughter of Albert Hopkinson, a Manchester physician who became, in retirement, a demonstrator in anatomy in Cambridge, and his wife, Olga Cunliffe-Owen. Bragg had met his future wife in 1919 in Cambridge, where she was reading history at Newnham College. Over the period 1924&#150;35 they had two boys and two girls. The elder son, Stephen (1923&#150;2014), an aeronautical engineer with Rolls-Royce, subsequently became vice-chancellor of Brunel University, while the younger, David, inherited the artistic talents of his father and grandmother. The elder daughter, Margaret, married Mark Heath, ambassador to the Holy See 1982&#150;5, and Patience, the younger, an authority on dyslexia, married David Thomson, younger son of Bragg's old friend Sir G. P. Thomson. In later years Bragg's wife was a JP, mayor of Cambridge, chairman of the Marriage Guidance Council, and wrote amusing articles in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>.<br>
<br>Bragg's achievements in Manchester included the introduction of the idea of atomic radii; experimental verification of the theory of X-ray diffraction from perfect and imperfect crystals; the derivation of experimental atomic scattering factors for sodium and potassium that stimulated theoretical work by D. R. Hartree; the development of methods for analysing increasingly complex structures, including especially the Fourier method of calculating the electron density distribution in a crystal&#151;following a suggestion by his father; the demonstration that X-ray analysis is properly regarded as a branch of optics; and the development, with E. J. Williams, of the theory of order&#150;disorder changes. In structural studies his main achievement was the analysis of a wide range of silicate mineral structures that led to a detailed understanding of silicate chemistry, but he also promoted the study of metals and alloys by A. J. Bradley and others that underlies modern solid-state physics.<br>
<br>This work is described in about a hundred original papers and reviews published in leading scientific journals, especially <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span>, <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, and <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Kristallographie</span>. In addition Bragg wrote: <span class="italic">The Crystalline State: a General Survey</span>, which appeared in 1933 as the first volume of a projected series to be edited jointly by father and son; <span class="italic">Electricity</span> (1936), an account of his Christmas lectures at the Royal Institution in 1934; and <span class="italic">Atomic Structure of Minerals</span> (1937), based on his Baker lectures at Cornell University in 1934. The volume <span class="italic">Electricity</span> was translated into many languages, including Czech, Finnish, and Japanese.<br>
<br>Despite his great productivity at Manchester, and the availability to him of a steady stream of postgraduate researchers&#151;for which he felt great gratitude&#151;Bragg was not always happy there. A possible post at Cambridge in 1929 did not materialize, and he refused the offer of a chair at Imperial College, London, in the same year. His mother's death in that year, coupled with his professional disappointments, a difficult relationship with his father, and the effects of the economic crash on his Manchester environment led him to an emotional crisis in 1930, during which his health broke down. However, he recovered quickly in the following year, and his move from industrial Didsbury to rural Alderley Edge, in 1933, helped him face the world with renewed vigour.<h2>
<a name="Cavendishprofessor19381954"></a>Cavendish professor, 1938&#150;1954</h2>Bragg became director of the National Physical Laboratory in November 1937 but he occupied the post for less than a year, being appointed Cavendish professor of physics at Cambridge in March 1938 in succession to Rutherford, who had died the previous October. Thus he followed Rutherford in a major chair for the second time, much to the disappointment of nuclear physicists, who had hoped to see one of their number continue Rutherford's work in Cambridge. Their opposition was the occasion for C. G. Darwin's memorable remark: &#145;nuclear physics is a passing phase&#146;  (Phillips, 110). In the event nuclear physics remained the largest single activity in the Cavendish Laboratory but Bragg concentrated mainly on promoting the development of other new lines of research. Even in his first year, which was taken up increasingly with preparations for war, he made further advances in X-ray optics, strengthened the study of metals in the crystallographic laboratory, and enthusiastically supported the crystallographic studies of proteins by M. F. Perutz, which had been started under the influence of J. D. Bernal and were to be Bragg's chief research interest for the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Bragg played no part in the war research that was conducted in the Cavendish but he acted as consultant to the sound ranging section in the army (the method was still useful and was employed, furthermore, in plotting the trajectories of the V 2 rockets) and to the Admiralty on underwater detection by the use of sound waves (asdic or sonar). He also served on committees set up by the Ministry of Supply to keep its scientific activities under review and as a member of the advisory council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1941 he spent six months in Ottawa, Canada, as scientific liaison officer, and in 1943 he visited Sweden to re-establish contacts with Swedish scientists.<br>
<br>Bragg was knighted in 1941 and his father, still at the Royal Institution, wrote to Lorna Todd, his sister-in-law in Adelaide: &#145;Isn't that fine? &hellip; He will have to be Sir Lawrence: we can't have confusion worse than ever &hellip; In spite of all care, people mix us up and are apt to give me a first credit on occasions when he should have it&#146;  (Caroe, 177). This was an issue that had bothered Bragg&#151;William or Willy to family and close friends&#151;since the earliest days, when his father, as an established senior scientist, was invited to describe Bragg's original work at the Solvay Conference on Physics in 1913, and it was still a sore point with him long after his father's death in 1942.<br>
<br>From 1939 to 1943 Bragg was president of the Institute of Physics. While working hard to maintain the activities of the institute and foster discussion about the needs of the post-war world, he was mainly responsible for the creation of the X-ray analysis group to promote X-ray research in both universities and industry. At the end of the war he also contributed to the formation of the International Union of Crystallography, of which he was the first president, and the publication of its journal <span class="italic">Acta crystallographica</span>.<br>
<br>After the war Bragg reorganized the Cavendish Laboratory, giving each research section as much autonomy as possible. The principal activities included nuclear physics; low temperature physics; radio physics, which embraced radio astronomy under Martin Ryle (of particular interest to Bragg as a further example of physical optics); and the crystallography and metal physics which were his chief concern. In 1946 he was awarded a royal medal of the Royal Society. Work on protein crystallography had been maintained during the war and in 1947 he persuaded the Medical Research Council to set up a research unit on the molecular structure of biological systems at the Cavendish Laboratory. This was the origin of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology&#151;and the site of the preliminary work which later led to the determination of the structure of DNA and, with Bragg's active participation, to the subsequent breakthrough to protein structure analysis.<br>
<br>During this Cambridge period Bragg published a further ninety papers and reviews in scientific journals despite his firm adherence to the principle that he would be listed only as an author if he had made a significant contribution to the work; he was general editor of two further volumes of <span class="italic">The Crystalline State</span> (1948 and 1953).<h2>
<a name="AttheRoyalInstitution19541966"></a>At the Royal Institution, 1954&#150;1966</h2>In 1954 Bragg left Cambridge to become resident Fullerian professor and director of the Davy&#150;Faraday Laboratory at the Royal Institution in London. There he maintained the traditional activities but sought to involve industry more closely through corporate membership. His association with industry and his interest in the industrial development of research had begun during his Manchester days, when he was in contact with local firms and with the Shirley Institute. Among other initiatives at the Royal Institution, he began an intensive programme of lectures for schoolchildren, gave popular science lectures on television, and built up a research team that collaborated with Kendrew and Perutz in the first successful studies of protein structures (myoglobin and haemoglobin) and was the first, in 1965, to determine the structure of an enzyme (lysozyme).<br>
<br>In this period Bragg collaborated with G. F. Claringbull in writing <span class="italic">The Crystalline State</span>, volume 4, entitled <span class="italic">Crystal Structures of Minerals</span> (1965), and he wrote another sixty papers, mainly reviews and published versions of lectures though they included, in his last original scientific paper, &#145;The determination of the co-ordinates of heavy atoms in protein crystals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acta crystallographica</span>, 11, 1958, 70&#150;75), a contribution that was important in the structure analysis of tobacco mosaic virus. Characteristically this method depended on the careful analysis of a few measurements, carried out by hand, and owed nothing to the growing dominance of digital computers in the development of the subject. On the international scene he was chairman of the Solvay Conferences on Physics (1948&#150;61), and president of the International Science Hall at the Brussels Exhibition in 1958.<br>
<br>By the time of his retirement in 1966 Bragg had made the Royal Institution again a leading centre of scientific research and, thanks in large part to the impact of television, a focus for the popular exposition of science to a wider audience than ever before. In recognition of his overall achievements he was rather belatedly awarded the Copley medal of the Royal Society in 1966 and appointed CH in 1967. During his career he had been awarded honorary degrees by eleven universities.<h2>
<a name="Characterandscientificlegacy"></a>Character and scientific legacy</h2>Bragg had a stocky build, a somewhat military appearance resembling his father, and a diffident manner. He was not self-confident in public affairs and he found committees and personal relations generally difficult to handle. He was essentially a private man who delighted in reading, painting, gardening, bird-watching, sailing, and domestic activities with his wife and family. But he wrote quickly and vividly, his public lectures were models of popular exposition, he had a profound grasp of classical physics, and he brought about an important scientific revolution. Through his development and promotion of X-ray crystallography in three major scientific appointments, Bragg transformed our understanding of the natural world: modern mineralogy, metallurgy, chemistry, and molecular biology were completely restructured as a result of his discoveries. Only two weeks before his death he completed the text of his last book, <span class="italic">The Development of X-Ray Analysis</span> (1975), which summarized these advances in his characteristically lively style. Ironically this work, which challenged the dominance of nuclear and quantum physics as <i>the</i> modern scientific disciplines, was carried out almost entirely in physics departments; the struggles for recognition of himself and his associates are a study in the emergence of new disciplinary boundaries.<br>
<br>Bragg died of cancer in Ipswich General Hospital, Suffolk, on 1 July 1971 and was cremated at Ipswich crematorium on 6 July after a funeral service in Waldringfield church near his country home.<br>
