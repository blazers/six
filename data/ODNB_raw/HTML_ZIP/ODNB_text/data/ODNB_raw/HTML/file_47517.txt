<span class="headword">Gestetner,  David</span>  (1854&#150;1939), <span class="occ">inventor of duplicating machinery and industrialist</span>, was born on 31 March 1854 in Csorna, Hungary, the first son of the four children of Sigmond Gestetner, a small businessman, and his wife, Theresa Figdor. He left school at the age of thirteen and in 1871 moved to Vienna to work in the office of a stockbroker before emigrating to the USA in 1873. He struggled to make ends meet in a variety of occupations in both New York and Chicago before returning to Vienna and entering into a partnership making equipment for hectographs (apparatus for copying documents using a gelatin plate). This partnership was dissolved in 1879 and he moved to London where he became an assistant at Fairholme &amp; Co., stationers, in the City. Gestetner had an inventive frame of mind and was preoccupied with the problems associated with copying from his original days in Vienna. In 1879, in London, he filed the first of his many patents in connection with copying. His most fundamental patent, filed in 1881, was concerned with the invention of the Cyclostyle, a pen with a small, sharp-toothed, rotating wheel at its tip which could be used to write and draw by perforating a new kind of stencil; the latter was based on a Japanese tissue with which he was familiar from a period during which he sold kites in Chicago. The pen and the stencil used in conjunction enabled office duplicating to be done for the first time in quantity, at speed, and with good quality results, and Gestetner can with justification be called the founder of the worldwide office copying and duplicating industry.<br>
<br>On 18 August 1885 Gestetner married Sophie Lazarus (1862&#150;1933), daughter of Ralph Lazarus, a government store contractor. They had one son and six daughters. His main interests were his business and his family. At different stages he employed his brother, his brother-in-law, various cousins, nephews, and nieces, as well as his son, three sons-in-law, and several grandchildren. He was a devout Jew who devoted any spare time to communal activities, especially connected with a congregation of like-minded believers he had been instrumental in founding. He never retired and continued to be involved in the firm he founded until his death, going daily to his laboratory in the main factory. The only exception to this routine was an annual two-month winter break in the south of France, from whence he communicated on a regular basis with his assistants in London. He died in the Hotel Ruhl, Nice, on 8 March 1939, during one of these breaks, and was buried in Nice.<br>
