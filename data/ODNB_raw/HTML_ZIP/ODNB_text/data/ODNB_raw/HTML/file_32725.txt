<div class="para">
<span class="headword">David, Sir  (Tannatt William) Edgeworth</span>  (1858&#150;1934), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born at the rectory at St Fagans, Glamorgan, on 28 January 1858, the eldest child of William David (<i>c</i>.1823&#150;1897), rector of St Fagans, and his wife, Margaret Harriette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson (<i>c</i>.1834&#150;1903). He was a descendant of the David family of Radyr Court, Cardiff, and on his mother's side from James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, the Abb&eacute; Edgeworth de Firmont, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, and Maria Edgeworth. He received his early education from his father, attended Magdalen College School, Oxford, and then became a scholar at New College, Oxford; he obtained a first class in classical moderations in 1878.<br>
<br>David's decision not to take holy orders prompted a bout of ill health which caused him to break his studies and travel to Canada and Australia. In 1880 he graduated in the pass schools, being particularly influenced by John Ruskin and the geologists Joseph Prestwich, Charles Tanfield Vachell, and his relative William A. E. Ussher. He continued to study geology at the Normal School of Science and Technology (later the Royal College of Science), under John Wesley Judd. In 1882 he was appointed assistant geological surveyor in New South Wales, under the direction of Charles S. Wilkinson. While travelling to Australia he met his future wife, Caroline Martha (Cara) Mallett (1856&#150;1951), whom he married in Sydney on 30 July 1885. David remained with the Geological Survey for nine years and produced highly praised reports and maps on tin mining, fossil occurrences, petrology, underground water, and particularly coal deposits of the Hunter River region; the last ensured that a source of gas-coal was kept in government rather than private control.<br>
<br>In 1891 David was appointed to the chair of geology at the University of Sydney, where he quickly became famous for his teaching ability, especially on his field excursions. Above medium height, he was tough and wiry, good at ice skating and skiing, and untiring in the field. With Thomas Anderson Stuart, David became involved in the preparations for the first expedition (1896) of the Royal Society to Funafuti in the Ellice Islands. When this proved unsuccessful he gained support for two further expeditions; he led the second (1897), accompanied by his wife, and planned the third (1898). The drilling to a depth of more than 1000 feet on the island went a long way towards supporting Darwin's theory of the origin of coral atolls. For this work David received the Bigsby medal of the Geological Society of London, and was elected FRS in 1900. He was known as Tavita by the inhabitants of Funafuti, a name he used for some publications in 1897 and 1898.<br>
<br>David's interest in glaciation, initiated in Wales, and the subject of his first publication, was stimulated with the recognition of late Palaeozoic glaciation in Australia. He pursued this matter in India in 1906, <i>en route</i> for Mexico for a meeting of the International Geological Congress, and continued to publish on this subject until his death. In 1907 he seized the opportunity to visit Antarctica with Ernest Shackleton's expedition, having used his influence to obtain Australian funding for it. He then applied retrospectively for university permission to remain in Antarctica and led the successful expeditions to the summit of Mount Erebus and to the south magnetic pole. These exploits and the popular lectures he gave around Australia to pay the expenses of the expedition made him widely known, and he was appointed CMG in 1910. David was instrumental in gaining funding and personnel and advising for various Antarctic expeditions up to 1930.<br>
<br>During the early years of the First World War, David gave patriotic lectures, and in 1915 persuaded the Australian government to use Australian miners by raising a battalion of Australian tunnellers. He enlisted, aged fifty-seven, and in 1916, with the rank of major, travelled to France, where he used his expertise in underground water and drilling with great success. He was particularly responsible for the great mining operation under Messines Ridge, which destroyed a German vantage point on 7 June 1917. Despite a fall down a mine shaft he remained active, and was mentioned in dispatches three times. In June 1917 he was appointed chief geologist and attached to the inspector of mines at general headquarters, British expeditionary force. He was awarded the DSO in 1918 and promoted lieutenant-colonel. In 1920 he was appointed KBE, but rather against his will.<br>
<br>After returning to Sydney, David began a serious attempt to compile a comprehensive <span class="italic">Geology of the Commonwealth of Australia</span>, which he had begun some years earlier. His offer to resign in 1922 to concentrate on the book was rejected by the university, which obtained funding to allow him to take leave for several years. He travelled widely in Australia to check important localities and discuss material with colleagues, but was deflected from his writing by involvement in the Pan-Pacific Congress held in Australia in 1923. He retired in 1924.<br>
<br>Despite travelling to England in 1925&#150;6 to write, David continued to be deflected from his proposed book by other interests, notably Precambrian life. He believed he had found evidence of both small and large forms in Precambrian rocks near Adelaide and worked on these until his death, but was particularly disappointed when the Royal Society rejected his paper on the subject.<br>
<br>David's <span class="italic">Geological Map of the Commonwealth of Australia</span> was published in 1931 (and reprinted in 1932 with accompanying notes) to general acclamation. The notes summarized his knowledge and ideas about Australian geology. Written in just a few weeks, it was an extraordinary achievement, and the culmination of an outstanding career. David realized he would never complete his much larger proposed work, which was taken over after his death by W. R. Browne and finally published in 1950, being essentially Browne's work rather than David's.<br>
<br>After a fall when he was alighting from a tram at Sydney University, David collapsed and died, on 28 August 1934 at the Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. His death produced an extraordinary reaction around Australia. The commonwealth and state governments moved unprecedented acts of sympathy and provided a state funeral at Sydney (Church of England) Cathedral on 30 August, which was attended by thousands. He was cremated at the Northern Suburbs crematorium, Sydney. He was survived by his wife, his son, and two daughters.<br>
<br>From his earliest days in Australia, David was heavily involved in the scientific societies, particularly the Royal and Linnean societies of New South Wales and the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science. He was first president (1921&#150;2), and councillor until his death, of the independent Australian National Research Council, the forerunner of the Australian Academy of Science, which supported the development of the government-sponsored Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and later Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). He received many awards, including the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London (1915), the patron's medal of the Royal Geographical Society, and honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Manchester, Cambridge, Wales, Sydney (all DSc), and at St Andrews (LLD).<br>
<br>Despite these activities and awards, David had contacts with farmers and railway navvies as well as premiers and generals, and his word was highly regarded by all. He combined in a rare way aspects of the romantic and the practical, but was essentially an interpretative rather than a creative genius. Although he contributed nothing original to the principle or method in geology, he saw order in complexity and the relations between things unlike or far apart, which led him to support the theory of continental drift of Alfred Wegener.<br>
