</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Denman,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Denman  (1779&#150;1854), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 23 February 1779 in Queen Street, Golden Square, London, the only son and youngest of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7494/', "Thomas Denman (1733&#150;1815)")</script>, a distinguished physician whose textbook on midwifery was an eighteenth-century best-seller, and his wife, Elizabeth (1747&#150;1833), daughter of Alexander Brodie, an army accoutrement maker. Denman remained close to his parents and twin sisters throughout their lives. His moral rectitude, the hallmark of his character, owed much to his mother's stern example and training  (Arnould, 1.8). His biblical knowledge was built on his promise to her to read one chapter of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> each day, a promise which he fulfilled even during the busiest period of his life. It was she who inspired his love of music and literature. His letters reveal him constantly turning to such favourites as Shakespeare, Dante (in a translation by his son-in-law, Ichabod Wright), Byron, whose obscene conversation repelled him however, and Wordsworth. Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Emma</span>, by contrast, he dismissed as a &#145;very silly book&#146;  (ibid., 1.114).<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Denman's love of the classics was just as great and his knowledge as profound. His classical education was a traditional one. From the age of three he was at Mrs Barbauld's school at Palgrave, Suffolk, and from seven at Dr Thompson's, Kensington. At the age of nine he was sent to Eton College where he remained until he was sixteen. At Eton he first expressed his ultra-liberal views, and was consequently bullied by most of his peers who were vehement Peelites or anti-Jacobins. But this ragging did not dilute his regard for the school; he sent three sons, Thomas, Joseph, and Richard, there, and presided at its 400th anniversary festival.<br>
<br>Denman's health was indifferent, and his father concluded that he should spend a year with his uncle the Revd Peter Brodie, rector of Winterslow, Wiltshire, before going up in 1796 to St John's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he read &#145;classics and general literature&#146;. For pure mathematics he had nothing but contempt; so, unable to take the mathematical tripos, he was debarred from competing for such major classical prizes as the chancellor's medals and left Cambridge with an ordinary degree. But unlike most &#145;ordinaries&#146; he did not give himself over to idleness and pleasure. His Cambridge companions were the intellectual &eacute;lite and he contributed a translation of the song of Callistratus to their <span class="italic">Collections from the Greek Anthology</span>, which Byron said was &#145;the best English translation&#146;  (Byron, <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span>, III.20). Cambridge strengthened his liberal views; like his father Denman venerated Fox and remained a Foxite until he died.<br>
<br>The Denman who left Cambridge in 1800 was no longer a sickly youth.<blockquote>His countenance was very expressive; the features high and strongly marked, but well formed and handsome, the whole face conveying an expression of sweetness combined with power. He was about five feet eleven inches in height, spare and strong in frame, capable and fond of vigorous exertion, as is proved by his having more than once while at Cambridge walked thence to London &hellip; in little more than twelve hours. (Arnould, 1.25)</blockquote>He had intelligence, presence, and a mellifluous voice, which have been the hallmarks of many a successful barrister, as he was determined to be.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsatthebar"></a>Early years at the bar</h2>Success at the bar came slowly. From 1800 Denman spent three years in London as a pupil successively to Charles Butler, the eminent real property lawyer, Henry Dampier, who became a judge of the king's bench, and the special pleader, William Tidd, whose pupils included John Singleton Copley (later Lord Lyndhurst), Christopher Charles Pepys, and John Campbell, all future lord chancellors. In 1803 he began practising as special pleader and a year later, on 18 October 1804, married the sister of a college friend, Theodosia Anne Vevers (1779&#150;1852), &#145;a young lady rich in virtues and graces &hellip; but with little or no fortune&#146;  (Arnould, 1.42). They lived modestly on an allowance of &pound;400 from Denman's father and on Denman's occasional articles for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, a whig magazine. Their marriage was an exceptionally happy and united one; of their fifteen children, five sons (among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7496/', "Thomas Aitchison Denman, second baron")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7493/', "George Denman")</script>) and six daughters survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Denman was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn on 9 May 1806, the same year as Campbell and two years after Copley, and joined the midland circuit and the Lincolnshire sessions. Denman claimed that on circuit he and Copley were drawn together by their &#145;sentiments &hellip; of extreme political Liberalism&#146;  (Arnould, 1.62). When Copley became solicitor-general in the Liverpool administration in 1819 Denman publicly accused him of apostasy, but Copley always denied ever having held radical views. Thereafter their relationship was formal&#151;Greville once saw them shake hands &#145;with much politeness and grimace&#146;  (Greville, 2.331). Denman &#145;never could forget or forgive this dereliction of principle&#146;  (Arnould, 1.63).<br>
<br>Denman was never without a certain amount of practice but, like many young barristers, he had to find other means of financial support, so he turned to literary journalism; for example, he reviewed John Marshall's <span class="italic">Life of Washington</span>. However, he rejected his father's suggestion that he become, like Copley and Campbell, a law reporter; Campbell's <span class="italic">Nisi prius Reports</span> proved wrong his prediction that &#145;the office of reporter is much oftener a bar than an introduction to general business&#146;  (Arnould, 1.69&#150;71). During these years his family was growing and on occasions his wife found herself &#145;distressed for money&#146;. Generous to a fault, he did not number prudence and economy among his many virtues. He enjoyed the social pleasures of circuit life which first brought him into contact with Brougham, who was to become an intimate friend. His uncle, Dr Joseph Denman, died in 1812 leaving him estates in Lynn, Norfolk, and Stoney Middleton in Derbyshire. This munificent device did not immediately relieve him of his financial worries since his interest was a reversionary one. But these did not deter him from leaving 5 Queen Square in Bloomsbury and moving to 50 Russell Square, then in &#145;point of residence, the &#147;ne plus ultra&#148; of a successful barrister's ambition&#146;  (Arnould, 1.58).<h2>
<a name="EntryintoparliamentandQueenCarolinestrial"></a>Entry into parliament and Queen Caroline's trial</h2>After five years Denman's practice began to increase, but at the bar he never earned the large fees which Campbell, Scarlett, or Pollock commanded. It was his eloquent defence in 1817 of Luddites, charged with high treason, which first brought him to the attention of the whig grandees who had few able lawyers in the House of Commons. His political views were well known, and in 1818 he was brought in as the member for the close borough of Wareham in Dorset, taking his seat on 14 January 1819. But he was never a committed parliamentarian and his interventions in debate were ponderous and uninspiring, disappointing his political patrons. In 1820, in the election following the death of George III, he was compelled to incur the considerable expense of contesting the open borough of Nottingham which, although he won the election, threw him further into debt.<br>
<br>1820 was for Denman a momentous year. Brougham and he were appointed respectively Queen Caroline's attorney- and solicitor-general. They were then made benchers of Lincoln's Inn, but Eldon, who never forgave them for attacking his court of chancery, refused to make either of them a king's counsel. Denman believed the queen to be &#145;the most wronged and insulted of womankind&#146;  (Arnould, 1.137). But, following Brougham's example, he forbade his wife to call on her, a decision which he later regretted. Soon after the queen's arrival in England Denman urged the House of Lords select committee to delay its report on the queen's conduct until the witnesses called by the Milan commission arrived in England. This was refused, and Lord Liverpool introduced a bill of pains and penalties in the House of Lords. Copley led for the crown and Brougham for the queen. Denman was the most prominent of Brougham's juniors. His final speech (24&#150;25 October 1820), which lasted ten hours, made him a popular Liberal hero. It was histrionic, passionate, emotional oratory which moved everyone who heard it but which does not have the same impact in print. Denman made two tactless aspersions. His sarcastic parallel between Caroline and the innocent Octavia, the wife of Nero, whose servants were tortured in an attempt to prove her adultery with a slave, enraged George IV who would not hear Denman's name spoken and refused him a silk gown. It was only after Denman's memorial, denying that he intended to compare the king to Nero, and Wellington's personal intervention at the insistence of Lyndhurst, that the king relented in 1828. The future William IV, who did not conceal his belief that Caroline was an adulteress, was equally incensed by Denman's famous apostrophe addressed to him, &#145;Come forth, thou slanderer&#146;; but, more magnanimous than his brother, he did not oppose Denman's appointment either as attorney-general (1830) or as lord chief justice two years later. The public loved what they saw as Denman's Hanoverian jibes, and Carlton House became known as Nero's Hotel. What passed unnoticed at that time in the packed and emotional House of Lords was his inapposite appeal to their lordships to imitate &#145;that Divine Authority&#146; who would not condemn the woman taken in adultery but said &#145;Go and sin no more&#146;&#151;which prompted the epigram<blockquote>
<div>Most gracious Queen we thee implore<br>
</div>
<div>To go away and sin no more;<br>
</div>
<div>Or, if that effort be too great,<br>
</div>
<div>To go away at any rate.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Politicalviews"></a>Political views</h2>Denman's popular success led to his election in 1822 as common serjeant of the City of London, defeating Bolland, later a baron of the exchequer. He was still a junior, so the stipend of &pound;1200 as common serjeant was a most welcome addition to his income. Among Denman's papers there is an autobiographical fragment which recorded his political credo while a member of the House of Commons. He opposed the policy of repression in Ireland, and was committed to the interest of &#145;freedom, justice and truth&#146;, to free trade, political and legal reform, to the purgation of corruption and abuse, and above all else to the abolition of slavery in every corner of the world. Between 1818 and 1826, in a hostile House of Commons, he introduced a motion for black emancipation, supported Brougham's motion for an inquiry into slavery in the West Indies, and spoke feelingly of the plight of individuals who had fallen foul of the repressive legislation forbidding seditious meetings and blasphemous libels, two of the infamous <span class="roman">Six Acts</span>. Both he and Campbell supported whig motions condemning Eldon's steadfast opposition to any proposal to remove the chancery arrears or to the reform of common-law procedure. He was very anxious to soften the rigour of the bloody criminal law, attempting to secure the abolition of the death penalty for forgery and counsel for those accused of felonies. Both proposals were later to be adopted.<br>
<br>Denman's campaign for legal reform was conducted outside the house as well as within it. It was probably he&#151;speaking fluent French as he did&#151;who wrote the critical, if complacent, review-essays in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (40, 1824, 169&#150;207) of Dumont's French edition of Bentham's <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; des preuves judiciares</span> advocating the adoption of the French system of investigation and interrogation of witnesses. For Denman, as for Blackstone, it was a matter of pride that an Englishman enjoyed the security of trial by a lawful jury of his county. Interrogation, he argued, was unfair to the prisoner: &#145;the mere fact of being accused is, in itself, an overwhelming calamity to an innocent man&#146;  (<i>O'Connell v. R.</i>, House of Lords appeal, D. Leady). Moreover, in France the &#145;keen encounter of wits between judge and culprit &hellip; have a direct tendency to degrade the dignity of justice, because they always disturb its calmness and serenity&#146;.<h2>
<a name="AttorneygeneraltheReformBill"></a>Attorney-general: the Reform Bill</h2>In the election of 1826 Denman decided not to stand; his finances were not equal &#145;even to an undisputed election&#146;  (Arnould, 1.204). However, after he became a king's counsel his practice increased; so in 1830 he stood again, and was elected for Nottingham. Denman was saddened that Wellington, whom he personally respected, remained obdurately opposed to parliamentary reform. But Wellington soon resigned, to be succeeded by Grey. In 1831 the cabinet resolved to introduce the first <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, and Denman, who had been appointed attorney-general in the previous November, was instructed to draft its complex provisions. In his speech following the introduction of the first <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> he took the opportunity to confess &#145;some sense of shame that he had not had virtue&#146; to refuse the invitation to stand for the rotten borough of Wareham in 1818  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 2, 2 March 1831, 1247). His speeches, on the second reading, were largely devoted to the refutation of the special objections to its clauses. On the dissolution of parliament, after Grey's defeat on Gascoyne's motion against the bill, Denman was returned for Nottingham unopposed.<br>
<br>When the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> was reintroduced the considerable burden of defending its schedules in committee fell on Denman. Like Campbell, Denman considered that the paramount question was parliamentary reform. But, also like him, he was no republican, describing himself as a &#145;Conservative reformer&#146;  (Arnould, 1.393).<blockquote>For to hazard all the secured benefits of an established order, from a distaste for those forms which fools alone contest; to reject the freedom which may be enjoyed under a constitutional monarchy for the purpose of an experiment &hellip; this is a course which would no doubt deserve many other names, but certainly that of folly in a pre-eminent degree. (ibid., 1.389)</blockquote>He reflected on the impact of the bill in a letter to his close friend Merivale:<blockquote>For my part I could have been well pleased to follow the great work of Parliamentary Reform with a long repose, that we may set our House in order, not as on the eve of dissolution, but to ensure its being safely and comfortably and socially inhabited. (ibid., 1.394)</blockquote>In March 1832 the bill passed the Commons, only for the Lords, led by Lyndhurst, to resolve to postpone discussion of the disenfranchising clauses until the enfranchising clauses had been debated. Grey immediately resigned and Wellington was invited to form an administration. Denman's prospects were now bleak. But he wrote cheerfully to his eldest daughter that, despite the loss of the common serjeantship, which he had resigned on becoming attorney-general, and the fact that the etiquette of the bar prevented him going on circuit again, he could not doubt that he should &#145;hold a good station at the Bar&#146;; his wife was not so optimistic, being a &#145;little hard to pacify just at first&#146; but was now &#145;a very Portia&#146;  (Arnould, 1.362). Denman's fears were not realized. Wellington found it impossible to form a government, and Grey once more became prime minister. On 4 June the House of Lords passed the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, the majority of tory peers having accepted Wellington's advice to give up the struggle.<br>
<br>It was not until early September 1832 that the parliamentary session ended and Denman was able to escape to the grange (or small manor house) at Stoney Middleton, near Bakewell, Derbyshire, which he had lovingly improved over the years. Some thought it unprepossessing; Wensleydale said that Denman &#145;must be very fond of ancestral property to like such a house&#146;  (Arnould, 1.384 n.). Denman was very tired. The <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> debates had been prolonged. Moreover, he had the burden of prosecuting the agrarian and Bristol rioters and was induced to issue <i>ex officio</i> informations against William Cobbett and Richard Carlile, the atheistic publisher, who were, he considered, more guilty than the rioters, having encouraged them to violence. But he resisted royal pressure to initiate further <i>ex officio</i> informations for libels on the royal family. Shocked as he was by their content and tone, he concluded that further prosecutions might be seen by juries as an attack on the freedom of the press.<h2>
<a name="LordchiefjusticeofEngland"></a>Lord chief justice of England</h2>The execution of rioters in Nottingham in January 1832 led to Denman's being vilified at a public meeting in August that year. However, at the general election following the <span class="roman">Reform Bill's</span> enactment he was again elected, having refused an invitation from the county of Derby. On 3 November 1832 Lord Tenterden died. On Brougham's suggestion, Grey proposed Denman as his successor and, &#145;after a short struggle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 3.224), William IV assented to the appointment which was enthusiastically greeted by the profession and the press. Denman was sworn in as lord chief justice of England on 9 November 1832, and presided over that most influential common-law court for the next seventeen years.<br>
<br>As an advocate Denman could not be compared to Scarlett, and as a lawyer he was much inferior to Campbell and Parke. Nor was he as intelligent as his contemporaries, Lyndhurst and Brougham. But his tenure as a judge was a successful one. His relationship with the other judges was one of &#145;uninterrupted harmony&#146;  (Arnould, 1.420&#150;21), the bar respected him, and the public regarded him as the personification of judicial dignity. When he took office there was a substantial volume of business in arrears in the king's bench. The exchequer was relatively moribund and the work of the court of common pleas was restricted by the fact that only serjeants-at-law could practise before it. Denman resolved to destroy what he called &#145;that gigantic monster called Arrear&#146;  (ibid., 1.423). He did so by working &#145;like a dragon&#146;  (ibid.) and requiring the court to sit from early in the morning until late in the evening; remarkably he did so without alienating either the profession or their clients. Denman was a distinguished trial judge. Although he quickly reached a decision, he had the capacity &#145;[to wind himself] up to the state of patience and quiet which alone can guide [him] through [the heavy calendar] with the least possible annoyance&#146;  (ibid., 2.140). He was impartial and unfailingly courteous. Like Lyndhurst, Denman was a judge for the parties, fair, scrupulous, and temperate.<br>
<br>Greville's judgement was very different. He wrote in his journal that Denman was a &#145;very bad judge but much respected&#146;  (Greville, 2.331). It is true that he left few memorable judgments. Denman thought that his reputation as a lawyer would depend on his judgment in <i>Stockdale v. Hansard</i> in 1839, which the distinguished American judge and jurist Joseph Story had praised  (Arnould, 2.110&#150;11). The court of king's bench held that the existence of a privilege claimed by either of the houses of parliament and, in particular, the House of Commons was a matter of law for the courts and was not determined by a resolution of either house. To decide otherwise would make the judge &#145;an accomplice in the destruction of the liberties of his country, and expose every individual who lived in it to a tyranny no man ought to submit to&#146;. &#145;In truth, no practical distinction can be drawn between the right to sanction all things under the name of privilege, and the right to sanction all things whatever, by merely ordering them to be done&#146;. Denman never forgave Campbell, then attorney-general, for his intemperate expression of disapproval and portrayal of Denman as a vainglorious champion of the people.<br>
<br>In <i>O'Connell's case</i> Denman joined Cottenham and Campbell in quashing O'Connell's conviction for conspiracy and sedition. They upheld two objections to the validity of the sentence, rejecting the advice of the great majority of the judges. Some of the counts in the indictment were bad. Moreover, the omission of names from the list of jurors was fatal. If this latter objection were rejected, &#145;trial by jury itself, instead of being a security to persons who are accused, will be a Mockery, A Delusion and a Snare&#146;. The reports contain other well-known judgments: for example, <i>Eastwood v. Kenyon</i> (1840), which established that moral consideration was not consideration necessary to found a binding contract; and <i>Williams v. Carwardine</i> (1833), which held that the motive for an act which amounts to an act of acceptance in law of an offer to contract is immaterial.<h2>
<a name="Denmanasalawreformer"></a>Denman as a law reformer</h2>In 1834 Brougham persuaded Grey to strengthen the judicial membership of the House of Lords. Denman was the obvious candidate; on 22 March his title was duly gazetted as Baron Denman of Dovedale. His belief in the rights of the individual was one of the moral principles central to his life. Unlike Lyndhurst, Denman was not a man who would sacrifice principle for party dogma. After the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, he wrote:<blockquote>The greatest of all political evils I have always thought was this&#151;injustice deliberately perpetrated or wilfully persisted in by the State. My own opinion has uniformly been that injustice and wrong, whenever detected, ought to be instantly swept away. Like everything that prevails, it will by degrees strengthen itself by inveterate habits and factitious interests &hellip; Let, then, the first moment be taken when you can bring a sufficient force to bear upon mischief. Shake off the bad principle while you may, and scan not too nicely the inconsistencies or even dangers that may result from the success of your exertions. (Arnould, 1.388&#150;93)</blockquote>He was alive to the connection between ignorance and crime, and &#145;doubted how far the State was justified in inflicting punishment for offences against which it had taken no means to guard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 27, 21 May 1835, 1335). In order to &#145;shake off bad principle&#146; he was ready to support tory bills for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> and the passing of the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Denman and Lyndhurst persuaded the House of Lords to pass, despite the opposition of most of the judges, Campbell's <span class="roman">Prisoners' Counsel Act</span> of 1837 which allowed counsel for a person accused of felony to address the jury and the accused to inspect and take copies of the deposition against him. Its &#145;practical execution&#146; was essential for &#145;the honour of the laws, for the due administration of justice, for the realisation of truth, and for the protection of innocence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 34.760&#150;78); and in the same year a bill abolishing the death penalty for all cases of forgery passed through both houses&#151;two measures which he had fought for when first elected to the House of Commons. In 1838, this time supported by his fellow judges, Denman unsuccessfully sought to persuade the house to allow witnesses to affirm instead of taking the oath; he thought a witness should be sworn according to the form which was binding on his conscience. The <span class="roman">Law of Evidence (Amendment) Act</span> of 1842 which Denman introduced embodied the Benthamite principles that all interested persons should be allowed to give evidence, leaving it to the jury to estimate its value. In 1841, moved by the appeal of Caroline Norton, Denman supported the <span class="roman">Custody of Infants Bill</span> which gave a wife separated from her husband access to her children. Denman was one of the few whig peers to attack the government over its treatment of Mazzini, who was said to be a dangerous foreigner, spreading sedition. His letters had been opened at the Post Office under the warrant of Peel's home secretary, Sir James Graham. In the debate in 1844 Denman condemned that so-called right as &#145;new, and &hellip; dangerous and utterly unknown to the people of England&#146;. It is no surprise that Denman supported every Liberal measure. What is surprising is that he regarded his successful proposal that the courts could sit <i>in banco</i> outside the brief legal terms as so significant that he asked for it to be recorded on his tombstone.<h2>
<a name="Campaignagainsttheslavetrade"></a>Campaign against the slave trade</h2>The abolition of all manifestations of the slave trade was, for Denman, the most important of reforms. Slavery was &#145;the foulest stain that ever rested on the character of the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 3, 1831, 1408&#150;96). His first major speech in the House of Lords was in the debate on the <span class="roman">Bill for the Better Suppression of the Slave Trade</span> of 15 August 1839. Before speaking he was in a &#145;state of the utmost anxiety&#146;  (Arnould, 2.101), as he always was when he spoke on slavery. The bill gave the crown power to seize vessels suspected of engaging in the slave trade. Denman dismissed fears that this would lead the country into war with France. Suppression of the slave trade must be a fact as well as a name: &#145;There must be a right of visitation and search&#146;. It was true that mistakes would inevitably be made by raiding parties; therefore it was necessary to &#145;indemnify the officers of Her Majesty in the discharge of the duty imposed on them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 50.331&#150;4). The judgment in <i>R. v. Serva</i> in 1845 shocked him. The <i>Felicidade</i> was a slave-trading vessel, whose crew had killed a boarding party from a Royal Navy cruiser and had been convicted of murder. But the judges gathered to consider crown cases concluded that their convictions could not stand. Denman and Baron Platt dissented. The majority gave no reasons for their decision, and in a pamphlet Denman proposed that in future they should do so.<br>
<br>Denman's son, Joseph, became the captain of a similar cruiser on the west African coast. He had released slaves from, and set fire to, barracoons where they had been incarcerated. Captain Denman was unsuccessfully sued for the loss suffered by the slave owner. The court of exchequer held that, although the slave owner had property in his slaves and could sue in trespass for their seizure, the ratification by the ministers of state of Captain Denman's act rendered it an act of state, for which the crown alone was liable. Denman bitterly commented that it was the first time that the claim of an owner of slaves had been recognized in an English court of justice.<br>
<br>Denman sensed with alarm that many politicians and members of the public were becoming antipathetic to the anti-slavery movement. The <span class="roman">Sugar Duties Bill</span> of 1846 proposed to equalize the duties on British colonial and slave-produced sugar. Denman spoke fervently against it, arguing that its enactment would increase the slave traffic. But the appeal to free trade prevailed and the bill reached the statute book. In 1848 a committee of the House of Commons, chaired by William Hutt, who had slave-trading interests, concluded that the posting of naval squadrons was ineffectual and counter-productive, increasing the suffering of black people. The slave trade should be left to itself. On 22 and 28 August Denman made two powerful speeches in the house which swayed public opinion and significantly contributed to the decision not to withdraw the squadrons. Denman's speeches on the slave trade were highly emotional, and he admitted that it was &#145;utterly impossible to talk of slavery and the Slave Trade with any degree of moderation,&#151;or indeed with any other feeling than that of the most perfect abhorrence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 88, 1848, 511). Anxious to appeal to the country, he published a number of pamphlets, including <span class="italic">The Slave Trade and the Press</span>, published anonymously in 1847, and <span class="italic">Letters to Lord Brougham on the Extinction of the Trade</span> (1848).<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>In 1849 Denman was seventy. On circuit and in London he sat very long hours in court; twelve-hour sittings were frequent. The strain was great and he suffered his first stroke the day before the beginning of the Easter term. But, ignoring medical advice, he was determined to sit in the Trinity term and to speak in the house, not only on the slave trade (which his doctors knew would excite him), but also on the motion to enable witnesses who had religious scruples to affirm rather than to take the oath. But the house again rejected the motion. In July 1849 Denman suffered his second stroke. He could now barely sign his name. Friends, including Brougham, and the eminent physicians, Sir Benjamin Brodie and Dr Thomas Watson, urged him to resign. But the prospect of Campbell succeeding him increased his determination to struggle on. Campbell's bitter attack on his motives in deciding <i>Stockdale v. Hansard</i> still rankled ten years later. But Denman was mollified by the letter of Russell, the prime minister: &#145;No one can be more persuaded than I am that in the decisions given on Privilege, as in all other cases, none but a conscientious sense of duty was allowed to prevail&#146;. Russell concluded with an assurance that Denman's name stood as a<blockquote>model of uprightness and independence in the judicial office. If, as I infer, you are about to resign, it would surely be better to carry an undivided homage with you into retirement than to raise a question as to your successor, in which many may think you right, but many others may think you wrong. (Arnould, 2.290&#150;91)</blockquote>In March 1850 Denman resigned.<br>
<br>For a short period Denman's health improved. In a letter to Brougham, later published in the <span class="italic">Law Review</span>, he chided his judicial brethren for their reluctance to embrace reform and their belief in the perfection of the legal system, &#145;whereas in truth the existing system is for the most part the neglected growth of time and accident&#146;  (Arnould, 2.319&#150;21). His final speech in the house, in May 1852, supported Truro's <span class="roman">Common Law Procedure Bill</span>. The &#145;one subject and one subject only, beyond the limits of his private grief [the death of his wife]&#146; which &#145;had still power to move him deeply &hellip; was the terrible, ever-haunting subject of slavery and the slave trade&#146;  (ibid., 2.332). The publication in England of Harriet Beecher Stowe's <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> aroused Denman's pity and horror. It led him to attack bitterly, through a series of articles in <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, his old friend Dickens, for his caricature of philanthropy run mad, personified by Mrs Jellaby in <span class="italic">Bleak House</span>, which he believed would undermine the anti-slavery movement. Dickens realized that Denman was a sick man, and wrote to his daughter, Margaret (Mrs Cropper), to say that he had &#145;cleared [his] mind of Lord Denman's last opinions of me&#146;  (ibid., 2.333).<br>
<br>Denman never recovered from his wife's death on 28 June 1852, and his final stroke occurred in Nice in early December of the same year. He comprehended what was said to him, but he would never speak again and could copy only what others had written. Denman died on 22 September 1854 at Stoke Albany, Northamptonshire, and was buried in the churchyard there.<br>
