<span class="headword">Nevill, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1705), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second of the three sons (there were at least three daughters) of Henry Nevill of Bathwick in Somerset. Admitted to Gray's Inn in 1650, he was called to the bar in 1658, and became an ancient of that inn in 1676. By the mid-1670s he had embarked upon a career of loyal service and advancement under the Stuarts. The king appointed him deputy lieutenant of Nottinghamshire on 28 July 1675, on the recommendation of the earl of Ogle. He was knighted in June 1681 on the occasion of an address he delivered to the king in his capacity as the recorder of Bath. Nevill was created serjeant-at-law on 21 January 1685, and James II appointed him king's serjeant upon his accession later that year. On 11 October 1685 James further promoted him to the position of baron of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Nevill was dismissed from this position on 21 April 1686 for refusing to uphold James's broad interpretation of the dispensing power. When the Convention Parliament of 1689 asked him to describe the circumstances of his dismissal, he stated that the king had sought his opinion on four separate occasions on his claim to have the authority to repeal all penal laws against religious dissenters. In his first three interviews he gave his opinion that the king had no such powers of dispensing, and he maintained this position during his fourth interview despite the chancellor's open threat of dismissal. Nevill received his dismissal eight days later, a casualty of James's purge of the courts.<br>
<br>Nevill returned to public life during the deliberations of the Convention Parliament in the role of expert legal counsel. On 30 January 1689 he was invited to appear before the House of Lords to give his opinion on the constitutional question of whether there existed an original contract between king and people upon which royal government is based. Like the other judges consulted, Nevill affirmed the existence of an original contract, although there was no mention of it in the law books. In his opinion contracts <i>per se</i> originated in man's first submission to government, a fact not mitigated even by conquest: &#145;In conquests the government puts the laws upon them [the governed], yet in a little time that becomes an original contract. It must of necessity be implied by the nature of government&#146;  (<span class="italic">House of Lords MSS</span>, 2.1689&#150;90). In this way he contributed to the growing consensus that kings held their titles not from God immediately but from God mediately with the community's sanction.<br>
<br>On 18 March 1689 Nevill was again sworn in as baron of the exchequer under King William's settlement of the courts. His patent was renewed on 20 April 1689, changing the condition of his tenure from the king's pleasure to good behaviour. Thereafter all barons of the exchequer held their office on condition of good behaviour. On 30 October 1691 he was translated from the exchequer to the court of common pleas, where he took his place above justices Rokeby and Powell due to his seniority in the bench. Nevill continued in this position under Queen Anne, who reappointed him on 23 June 1702. During these years he assisted in several of the state trials, where he &#145;seems to have acted an honest and independent part on the bench&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 399). Nevill died on 8 August 1705 and was buried in Hammersmith Chapel, Fulham, Middlesex, on 11 August. His wife, Frances, is named in his will, dated 1 July 1703, but nothing else is known of her; they had no heir.<br>
