<span class="headword">Copley <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Luttrell]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1577&#150;1662), <span class="occ">protestant convert and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Louvain in the Spanish Netherlands, the fourth and youngest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6273/', "Thomas Copley (1532&#150;1584)")</script> of Gatton, Surrey, and Roughay, Sussex, a coheir of Lord Hoo and Hastings, whose title he used, and of his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Luttrell (<i>d</i>. in or after 1590), whose family had lands in East Anglia; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6268/', "Anthony Copley")</script> was his elder brother. His family had fled England as recusants but John was taken back there at nine days old to be nursed and educated. He stayed with a conformist uncle named Southwell, worshipping as an Anglican, but from his seventh year was also taught the Roman Catholic faith. When he was nine he and his mother went to Li&egrave;ge. The following year he started at King's College, Douai; then he continued his education successively at Valenciennes, the English College, Douai, and the Jesuit English College at St Omer, where he was one of the first to enter in 1593 and remained until about 1595. His mother returned to England, where in May 1596 she conformed.<br>
<br>About this time, while on a voyage, Copley and five fellow students were captured by an English ship near Calais and taken to London, where his relation Lord Howard of Effingham, as lord admiral, and Archbishop Whitgift entertained them. Copley was handed over to Bishop Aylmer and instructed in Anglican doctrine, but was soon freed on his friends' surety, and described himself as indulging in worldly pleasures while continuing to receive the Roman Catholic sacraments. However, in October 1599 he was admitted to the English College in Rome, and ordained sub-deacon, deacon, and priest in 1602. In September he left for England via Douai. He worked diligently as a seminary priest, sometimes under the name Luttrell, in the Roman Catholic London district, befriending many and initially with a strong conviction that he was serving God.<br>
<br>The Gunpowder Plot was a watershed for Copley. Convinced that the priests connected with it, whose guilt he assumed, would not have acted without papal authority, he was deeply disillusioned, considering that the pope would rather be the vicar of hell than the vicegerent of Christ. In July 1606 he was banished, with twenty-three other priests, and arrived at Douai. He was shocked by the acquiescence of the Jesuits abroad in the plot, regarding Roman Catholic teaching on the pope's power to depose rulers as totally unacceptable. He soon returned to England, but in May 1607 was arrested at Flushing; in October was indicted for hearing mass in Newgate gaol.<br>
<br>By this time Copley had read extensively in protestant polemic, the better to refute it. This stirred up doubts, fuelled by his reading of Bellarmine's <span class="italic">Controversies</span>. Some protestants challenged him to satisfy them on disputed points from scripture, the early fathers, or natural reason, which he was unable to do: his studies convinced him that the Anglican position was right. This led to a spiritual crisis in which &#145;my poore soule [was] environed with perplexed assaults of flesh and bloud&#146;  (Copley, 10). His struggle &#145;to overcome these conflicts between truth and falsehood&#146; was aggravated by ties with numerous friends and recusant relatives, and by the thought of the distress apostasy would cause his converts. Once released from prison he became a chaplain to his kin the Cottons, but had to leave in 1610 owing to friction within the household. In 1611 his inner turmoil led to a spiritual Damascus experience, and Anglicanism. He was then chaplain to the Sussex-based Anthony Maria Browne, Viscount Montague. While in his service Copley fell in love with his future wife, Rebecca Moone, and they were married in St Margaret's, Westminster, on 10 December 1611. Commentators as different as John Chamberlain and archpresbyter George Birkhead concluded that it was a woman's love which had enticed Copley from Catholicism.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Doctrinall and Morall Observations Concerning Religion</span> (1612) Copley argued his new theological position moderately, with much reference to Roman Catholic works and those of the early fathers supporting his view, as well as personal testimony. In July, James I pardoned him for activities regarded as treasonable under the 1586 <span class="roman">Act against Seminary Priests</span>. Birkhead had already concluded four months previously that Copley had betrayed to the government all he knew of the activities of Catholic missionaries. Although he averred he would not inform against priests, it seems that Copley did subsequently inform against lay Catholics. In October, Archbishop Abbot, on whom he had attended following his conformity, presented him to Bethersden vicarage in Kent, which he resigned when Abbot collated him to the rectory of neighbouring Pluckley in 1616. Rebecca Copley died, and was buried there on 10 March 1623. Copley married again, on 9 February 1624 at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, Alyce Boucher, a widow, who died in 1638: on his death he left a third wife, Martha. All marriages were apparently childless.<br>
<br>In the 1630s Copley repeatedly conflicted with Sir Edward Dering at Pluckley over alleged wrongful appropriation of tithes and other rectorial matters. Dering's petition to Archbishop Laud in 1637 that Copley be removed to another living was fruitless, apparently owing to Copley's own obstruction. On 29 March 1642, together with Dr Richard Sheldon and Mr Higgins, Copley was summoned to the House of Commons accused of supporting a Kentish petition initiated by Dering which favoured the prayer book, royal control over the militia, and a synod of divines, but he denied any connection, and the Commons took no further action in the case. However, in September 1643 his benefice was sequestrated. Copley was restored to Pluckley in 1660, but may never have returned there as he died in Ashford, Kent, where he was buried on 3 June 1662. By his will, dated 19 September 1658, he left what he termed his &#145;small estate&#146; (valued at &pound;91 8<i>s</i>., including debts) to his wife, Martha  (Canterbury Cathedral Archives and Library, DC6/PRC 17/71/246).<br>
