<span class="headword">Burney,  Frances</span>  (1776&#150;1828), <span class="occ">governess and poet</span>, was born in London in January 1776, the fourth child and second daughter of cousins Esther (Hetty) Burney (1749&#150;1832) and Charles Rousseau Burney (1747&#150;1819), and niece of the novelist and diarist Frances Burney, Madame D'Arblay. Her parents were both talented musicians: Esther had been a child prodigy and had made her musical d&eacute;but playing the harpsichord before a select audience at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, in 1760, while Charles Rousseau was an acknowledged virtuoso of both the harpsichord and the violin. Despite their talent, the couple&#151;and their eight children&#151;were dogged by poverty, and in 1794 Frances was obliged to take up her first post as governess in the household of Lord Beverley. Thereafter family connections helped her to secure positions in a number of eminent households, her employers including the attorney-general Sir Thomas Plumer (1753&#150;1824) and Sir Henry Russell (1751&#150;1836), chief justice at Bengal.<br>
<br>In spite of the gruelling nature of her work and chronic ill health, Burney pursued her education and gradually acquired a library that included books in French, German, Latin, Greek, and Italian. In 1818 she published <span class="italic">Tragic dramas; chiefly intended for representation in private families: to which is added, Aristodemus, a tragedy, from the Italian of Vincenzo Monti</span>. The tragedies themselves, &#145;Fitzormond, or, Cherished Resentment&#146; and &#145;Malek Adhel, the Champion of the Crescent&#146;, are overblown and melodramatic, and the style and tone can be gleaned from a short quotation from &#145;Fitzormond&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Lady Fitzormond: &#145;My taper's spent, yet I am loth to quit<br>
</div>
<div>The deep'ning gloom of this sequester'd scene&#146;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>It is telling that the very title of these plays assures readers that they are meant for private performances only&#151;Frances had clearly been affected by the concerns of her grandfather Charles Burney (1726&#150;1814) about the potential impropriety of the stage, particularly for female dramatists. Burney's preface to <span class="italic">Tragic Dramas</span> similarly recalls her aunt's preface to <span class="italic">Evelina</span> (1776) in expressing feminine diffidence at publishing:<blockquote>Various motives &hellip; having combined to induce the Writer of the following pages to bring them before the public, she is desirous, by stating a few of them, to obviate as much as possible, the imputation of temerity to which the publication of them may subject her. (p. 1)</blockquote>Burney suffered attacks of jaundice throughout her life, and on Friday, 28 March 1828, &#145;wasted to a skeleton&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals and Letters</span>, 11.712), she succumbed to the disease at her mother's home in King Street, Bath. She was buried on 4 April at Batheaston church, where her father's remains were also interred. Though a letter to Esther from Frances Burney, Madame D'Arblay, in 1824 had rather petulantly complained of what she saw as her niece's neglect: &#145;I once thought I had caught a bit of her heart&#151;&amp; I <i>tried</i> for it, 3 or 4 years ago&#151;but I see, &amp; am sorry to see, my mistake&#146;  (ibid., 11.566), Burney's pupils evidently loved their old governess who was a regular visitor and guest  (ibid., 11.371). As her aunt observed, in spite of an onerous profession and repeated illness, &#145;her spirits seem never failing&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
