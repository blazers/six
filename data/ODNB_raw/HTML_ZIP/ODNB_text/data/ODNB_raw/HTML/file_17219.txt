<span class="headword">Luttichuys,  Simon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> 1661), <span class="occ">painter</span>, son of Barent Luttichuys, was born in London and baptized at the Dutch church, Austin Friars, London, on 6 March 1610. His parents presumably returned to the Netherlands when he was young; his brother Isaack's first dated portrait betrays a Dutch training. Simon, however, is not recorded in the Netherlands until 1649, when he and his sick wife, Anneke van Peene, made a joint will at Amsterdam. In 1655 he was married at Amsterdam for a second time, to Johanna Cocks of &#145;Naerfick&#146; in England. He worked mainly as a still-life painter, and influenced the celebrated Willem Kalf, who finished one of Luttichuys's pictures after his death. In 1660 at Breda he painted portraits of Charles II, James, duke of York, and Henry, duke of Gloucester, which were engraved by Cornelis van Dalem. He died in Amsterdam, where he was buried on 16 November 1661 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>. An inventory of his effects was drawn up in January 1662.<br>
<br>Luttichuys's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_17218"></a><span class="headword">Isaack Luttichuys</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> 1673), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was baptized at the Dutch church, Austin Friars, on 25 February 1616. In 1638 he signed and dated a portrait of Anne Blaeu, mother of the Dutch poet P. C. Hooft, and a resident of Amsterdam. In 1643 he married Elisabeth Winck at Amsterdam, but she soon died, bequeathing their baby daughter 1000 guilders in October 1645. He had remarried by 21 January 1647 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>; his second wife was Sara Gribert (or Grabey or Grelant). Isaack was principally a portraitist, though he occasionally made still lifes. He seems to have encountered financial difficulties in his last years; in 1668 he had to pawn twenty-one paintings and some household effects to honour a debt of 793 guilders. He was buried in the Westerkerk at Amsterdam on 6 March 1673 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>.<br>
