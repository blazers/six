<span class="headword">Birch,  Eugenius</span>  (1818&#150;1884), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Gloucester Terrace (later Pitfield Street), Shoreditch, on 20 June 1818, the son of John Birch, corn dealer, and his wife, Susanna. An elder brother, John Brannis Birch, was born in 1813. Birch showed considerable mechanical and artistic talent at an early age. Educated in Brighton, and then at Euston Square, London, he was enthralled by the works on the London&#150;Birmingham railway. He was trained in a succession of London's engineering works&#151;Samuel Wright, J. and G. B. Blyth, and R. A. and O. Robinson&#151;as well as attending a mechanics' institute. In November 1835 the London and Birmingham and Great Western railways offered a prize for first-class carriage design. Although he was unsuccessful in the competition, his method of putting the wheels under the carriages was adopted by the London and Greenwich Railway. In 1837 he received a silver Isis medal from the Society of Arts for his drawing of a marine steam engine, and in 1838 the Institution of Civil Engineers' Telford medal for his drawings and description of Huddart's rope machinery. In 1839 Birch was elected a graduate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. At that time he and his brother were working for Rowland Macdonald Stephenson (1808&#150;1895). On 10 February 1842 Birch married Margaret, daughter of Charles Gent, of Moss Side, Manchester, a manufacturer. There were no children.<br>
<br>In 1843 Stephenson left for Calcutta in connection with the East India Railway which he had been promoting, and meanwhile Birch entered into partnership with his elder brother. They were engaged in various unsuccessful railway schemes in the years of the &#145;railway mania&#146; including the Leek and Mansfield, Manchester and Rugby orient and Salisbury and Swindon railways. Birch designed the Kelham and Stockwith bridges in Nottinghamshire and many of the bridges on the East India Railway between Calcutta and Delhi. The Birch brothers had an office at 3 Cannon Row, Westminster, from 1841 to 1856, and at 43 Parliament Street from 1858 to 1864. From 1864, after the death of his brother, Birch occupied offices at 7 Westminster Chambers, Victoria Street, London SW1.<br>
<br>Birch's fame rested mainly on the fourteen seaside piers he built around the coasts of England and Wales. The longest surviving were Aberystwyth (shortened), Birnbeck (Weston-super-Mare), Blackpool's North Pier, Bournemouth, Eastbourne, Hastings, and the West Pier, Brighton. Experts consider his finest achievement to be the West Pier, with its elegant cast-iron kiosks, railings, and windscreens. Birch's piers were noteworthy for their screw-pile method of construction, which he pioneered at Margate. This method, based on Alexander Mitchell's patent, involved screwing the cast-iron columns into the sea-bed, sometimes by means of a winch mounted on a barge. Birch was also a great believer in the corrosion-resistant qualities of cast-iron columns, and this confidence was fully vindicated by time. Apart from his piers, he carried out the Devon and Somerset Railway, Exmouth docks, Ilfracombe harbour, and Eastbourne, Margate, and west Surrey waterworks.<br>
<br>Birch was also a talented artist. Apart from his early technical drawings, he painted over a hundred water-colours during a visit to Italy, Egypt, and Nubia in the winter of 1874&#150;5. He died at his home, Laurieston Lodge, West End, Hampstead, on 8 January 1884.<br>
