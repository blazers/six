<span class="headword">Pinnock,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1782, <em>d.</em> 1843), <span class="occ">publisher and compiler of educational works</span>, was born in Alton, Hampshire, and baptized there on 3 February 1782, the son of John Pinnock and his wife Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall. Little is known of his early family life except that they lived in humble circumstances. After a period as a schoolmaster Pinnock became a bookseller in Alton and wrote and published his first works in 1810&#150;11: <span class="italic">The Leisure Hour: a Pleasing Pastime Consisting of Interesting and Improving Subjects</span>, with explanatory notes, and <span class="italic">The Universal Explanatory Spelling Book</span>, with a key and exercises. Expanding reading audiences in the early nineteenth century created significant new markets for educational works. Such markets, combined with improvements in printing technology, presented opportunities for entrepreneurial writers and publishers like Pinnock to make a living from literary projects for &#145;popular&#146; audiences. Pinnock moved his business to Newbury, Berkshire, in 1811 and then in 1817 to London, where in partnership with Samuel Maunder (whose sister, Ann, he had married on 1 December 1814) he bought the premises of the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> at 267 Strand and took shares in that publication.<br>
<br>Pinnock and Maunder ceased to print the paper after number 146 and began to publish a series of highly successful short catechistic manuals, constructed in the form of questions and answers and sold under Pinnock's name. It is unclear how much of the literary work he did himself, and how much came through the networks of publishers, writers, and schoolteachers in the London area. The catechistic method of instruction, used to inculcate Christian truth, became secularized in Pinnock's period and was deployed as an educational device to lead the reader to memorize &#145;matters of fact&#146;. Such a technique was seen by many as an appropriate way of educating the lower orders. Pinnock issued eighty-three &#145;catechisms&#146; in series at 9<i>d</i>. each, covering such eclectic topics as chess, conchology, sacred geography, history, agriculture, and algebra, of which many were translated into German, French, and Arabic.<br>
<br>Pinnock produced educational texts in varied subjects but he also designed texts to appeal to specific audiences based on age, gender, and social position. He produced new works but also marketed &#145;improved and updated&#146; established educational &#145;trade&#146; works such as Joyce's <span class="italic">Scientific Dialogues</span> (1800) and Mangnall's <span class="italic">Historical and Miscellaneous Questions</span> (1800). He had considerable success with several literary projects, and his abridgements of Goldsmith's histories of England, Greece, and Rome, which went through many editions, were highly profitable. The quality of the history they contained, however, is questionable, as the historical facts selected as important&#151;such as the large cost of George IV's robes&#151;tend towards the sensationalist and novel. His series of county histories, which were compiled largely from the work of other writers, were collected into the <span class="italic">History and Topography of England and Wales</span> (1825) and were also successful.<br>
<br>Despite such success, Pinnock was in perpetual financial distress owing to the costs and failings of his speculations in the businesses of wood veneering and manufacturing pianos, and he was eventually forced to sell most of his copyrights to various other publishers. He died at his home, Broadley Terrace, Blandford Square, London, on 21 October 1843.<br>
<br>Pinnock's son <a name="cosubject_22305"></a><span class="headword">William Henry Pinnock</span>  (1813&#150;1885) was a <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>. Educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, he was ordained in 1843, and graduated LLB in 1850 and LLD in 1855. He followed his father in compiling elementary textbooks and engaging in revising and improving previously established works&#151;notably his father's abridgement of Goldsmith's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (46th edition, 1858). His considerable literary output was largely devoted to ecclesiastical laws and usages. He died at his vicarage at Pinner, Middlesex, on 30 November 1885, and was survived by his daughter Agnes Alicia Pinnock.<br>
