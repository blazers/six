<span class="headword">Macdonnell,  Alexander</span>  (1798&#150;1835), <span class="occ">chess player</span>, born in Belfast, the son of Alexander Macdonnell (<i>d</i>. 21 April 1843), a Belfast physician, was intended for a career in commerce, and carried on an extensive business at Demerara between 1820 and 1830. He became a vigorous propagandist for the slave-owning sugar planters in the West Indies, publishing an account of the condition of slaves in Demerara (1824), a defence of the corn laws, navigation laws, and commercial protection generally (1826), and a justification of the West Indian legislatures' handling of the slavery question (1826). Soon after 1830 he was appointed secretary to the West India Committee of Merchants, his duties being to watch the parliamentary progress of bills connected with the West Indies, notably the emancipation of slaves.<br>
<br>Macdonnell was trained as a chess player by William Lewis, but, once he had got over the odds of &#145;pawn and move&#146;, Lewis refused to meet him on equal terms, and from the foundation of the Westminster chess club in 1831 Macdonnell was tacitly admitted to be the best English player.<br>
<br>In June 1834 Louis Charles Mah&eacute; de Labourdonnais, secretary of the Paris chess club, and a pupil of the old French champion Alexandre des Chapelles, visited Britain and challenged Macdonnell's supremacy. Then commenced at the Westminster club in Bedford Street a match that was &#145;a landmark in the history of the game &hellip; analysed by leading masters to an extent not previously known&#146;  (Hooper and Whyld, 56). Labourdonnais spoke no English and Macdonnell no French, and the only word that passed between them was &#145;check&#146;. The struggle began with three drawn games of great length, thanks to Macdonnell's frequent agonized pondering of a single move over an hour and a half. Slowly, however, the Frenchman obtained the advantage, and of some eighty-five games he won about forty-four, thirteen games being drawn (accounts of the details vary slightly). Commentators have generally criticized Macdonnell's openings, which in fact were so habitually dangerous that he generally lost when playing white. He gained, however, a period of advantage by adopting the Evans gambit, of whose inventor, Captain William Evans, he had been an early victim, probably in 1825 or 1826. The fiftieth game of the series &#145;may be called the greatest game ever won by a British player&#146;  (Matthews, 19). The duel was at length interrupted by Labourdonnais's recall to Paris. Before the antagonists could again meet, Macdonnell&#151;who was suffering from Bright's disease&#151;died, at the boarding-house in Tavistock Square where he had long lived, on 14 September 1835. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, where five years later his great opponent was also interred. Macdonnell was unmarried. The first great British player, he had scaled the heights after only a few years' serious acquaintance with chess, lending credence to George Walker's belief that a little more experience would have made him a match for Labourdonnais in what was effectively a world championship contest. The time, however, was not afforded him.<br>
