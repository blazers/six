<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nelson,  George Horatio</span>, first Baron Nelson of Stafford  (1887&#150;1962), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and company manager</span>, was born at 102 Church Road, Islington, London, on 26 October 1887, the eldest child in the family of two sons and one daughter of George Nelson, textile merchant, of Muswell Hill, Middlesex, and his wife, Emily Walsh Lewis. He was educated at City and Guilds Technical College, where he worked under Silvanus Thompson. After gaining a diploma and the Mitchell exhibition, he moved on, with a Brush studentship, to the Brush Engineering Company at Loughborough. He then joined the British Westinghouse Company in Manchester, becoming chief outside engineer at Trafford Park in 1911, and chief electrical superintendent in 1914. In 1913 he married Florence Mabel 
    (Jane; 1888&#150;1962)
  , only daughter of Henry Howe JP, for Leicestershire. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>At Westinghouse, Nelson was responsible for the manufacture and installation of steam and hydro-electric power equipment and electric traction equipment in various parts of the world. He remained with the same company when it joined the Metropolitan Vickers Group, becoming manager of the Sheffield works of Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company in 1920, and stayed at the works, which specialized in electric traction, for ten years. Sir Holberry Mensforth, who had been works manager at Trafford Park, and who had subsequently joined the English Electric Company, then persuaded Nelson to become English Electric's managing director. When Mensforth retired in 1933 Nelson was appointed chairman and managing director.<br>
<br>Nelson set the English Electric Company on its feet, expanding the work force, handling men and contracts with great skill, and fully understanding the engineering aspect of his company. In &#145;clearing the decks&#146; he made some bold, far-ranging, and usually correct decisions which were to alter and broaden the whole concept of the business. When the rearmament programme began he spent many months trying to persuade service chiefs of the contribution his organization could make, and finally won a contract for seventy-five Hampden bombers. These were followed by 2470 Halifax bombers and 2730 tanks. By the end of the war, English Electric was undertaking the production of the Canberra bomber to its own design, which was one of the most successful of its time.<br>
<br>In 1942 Nelson went to the United States and Canada as chairman of the United Kingdom tank mission to discuss a joint policy for tank production. He served on the heavy bomber group committee of the Air Ministry from 1939 to 1945, on the reconstruction joint advisory council in 1943&#150;4, on the higher technological education committee in 1944&#150;5, and was chairman of the census of production committee in 1945. He was president of the Federation of British Industries in 1943&#150;4, a most difficult period.<br>
<br>After the war, English Electric acquired Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company, which increased Nelson's responsibilities. He also found time to develop his interest in technical education. His own companies provided much technical training, and he served on the governing body of the Imperial College of Science and Technology, on the court of governors of Manchester College of Science and Technology, and on the governing body of Queen Mary College, London. He was president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1955, and of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1957&#150;8. He served as prime warden of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1960. In 1955 Imperial College made him an honorary fellow and granted him an honorary diploma. In 1957 he received an honorary LLD from Manchester. The previous year he received the freedom of Stafford.<br>
<br>Nelson received a knighthood in 1943, a baronetcy in 1955, and was raised to the peerage as first Baron Nelson of Stafford in 1960. Nelson died at the premises of the English Electric Company, in Stafford, on 16 July 1962 and was succeeded by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58036/', "Henry George Nelson (1917&#150;1995)")</script>, who became chairman of the General Electric Company Ltd from 1968, chancellor of Aston University, and a member of the court of the Bank of England.<br>
