<span class="headword">Aveling,  James Hobson</span>  (1828&#150;1892), <span class="occ">obstetric physician</span>, was born in Cambridgeshire, the son of a local landowner. He studied medicine at Aberdeen University, where he graduated MB in 1856 and MD in 1857. He had settled in Sheffield in general practice soon after qualifying MRCS in 1851 and in a very short time managed to gain a prominent position in the profession locally. Having devoted himself especially to the treatment of the surgical diseases of women, in 1863 he founded the Sheffield (later Jessop) Hospital for Women, one of the first of its kind in England. In 1868 he decided to leave Sheffield, apparently on account of his wife, Charlotte Jane's, ill health; such was his reputation that, on leaving the town, he was presented by the mayor with a public testimonial, at a special dinner held in his honour. After a period of residence in the country, Aveling moved to London and in 1868, with the help of Robert Barnes and Thomas Chambers, he established the Chelsea Hospital for Women. He was senior physician to that hospital for many years, and on retiring from his post he was made consulting physician. In 1891 he took a prominent role in the opening of the convalescent home at St Leonards, Sussex.<br>
<br>Aveling was an inventive and innovative practitioner. He devised a midwifery forceps and an appliance for the treatment of uterine inversion, as well as pioneering the use of chloroform in childbirth; a firm believer in the treatment of uterine tumours by electricity, he adopted Georges Apostoli's method for dealing with them. Aveling was a founding member of the Obstetrical Society of London (1859) and of the British Gynaecological Society (1884). He was for many years the editor of the <span class="italic">Obstetrical Journal</span> and contributed numerous original articles to medical literature. His most important monographs include <span class="italic">Memorials of Harvey</span> (1875), <span class="italic">The Influence of Posture on Women in Gynecic and Obstetric Practice</span> (1878), <span class="italic">The Chemberlens and the Midwifery Forceps</span> (1882), and <span class="italic">On the Inversion of the Uterus</span> (1886).<br>
<br>Aveling was greatly interested in the question of midwives, and devoted much time and attention to the improvement and regulation of their practice. He believed that suitably trained midwives, who at that time were still subservient to the male medical practitioner, could do useful work both in the hospital and the wider community. One of his main reasons for establishing a women's hospital in Sheffield was the desire to avoid the suffering caused by untrained midwives. He considered that as it was working-class women who were most in need of trained midwives it was important to encourage poorer women to become midwives, rather than rely on middle-class women, who would be in a position to compete with general practitioners for middle-class confinements. He embodied his views in <span class="italic">English Midwives: their History and Prospects</span> (1872), which he characterized as &#145;A sad story of indifference and neglect, of petty jealousies and sordid interests, of murdered innocents, lost mothers and bereaved families&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Midwives</span>, 168). He was for some time chairman of the board for examining midwives of the Obstetrical Society of London.<br>
<br>Aveling was a cultured and well-educated man, who took a considerable interest in antiquarian matters. He was an active member of the Literary and Philosophical Society and wrote a <span class="italic">History of Roche Abbey (Yorkshire) from its Foundation to its Dissolution</span> (1870), which was highly regarded at the time. His book <span class="italic">Fables</span>, published in 1886, was dedicated to Princess Frederica. Aveling died at his home, 1 Upper Wimpole Street, London, on 12 December 1892, of enteric fever, survived by his wife, and was cremated at Woking on 15 December.<br>
