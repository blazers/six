<span class="headword">Vickris,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1700), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was born in Bristol, the son of Hester (<i>d</i>. 1722?) and Robert Vickris (<i>d</i>. 1684) of that city. His father was a puritan merchant and local politician whose family came from Bewdley, Worcestershire. Like his own father, Richard Vickris the elder (<i>d</i>. 1668), sheriff in 1636, Robert Vickris was a prosperous merchant who served as master of the Merchant Venturers' Society. Both men opposed the growing Quaker presence in Bristol.<br>
<br>Richard Vickris received a gentleman's education. Probably following the example of his mother, who was a member of the Bristol Quaker meeting from at least 1669 or 1670, young Richard Vickris began an association with the Quakers. Aiming to rid him of his new beliefs, Robert Vickris sent his son to France. There he continued his education and encountered the ideas of Nicolas Malebranche, who had been employing a modified Cartesianism to formulate a &#145;search for truth&#146;. The ideas that eventually found their way into Malebranche's <span class="italic">Recherche de la v&eacute;rit&eacute;</span> (1674) provided Vickris with a metaphysical explanation for the central Quaker tenet, the inner light of Christ. Consequently, Vickris left France intellectually as well as spiritually engaged with his beliefs.<br>
<br>After his return to England, Vickris married Elizabeth Bishop (1655&#150;1724), daughter of Elizabeth Bishop, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Canne (<i>d</i>. 1658), and the Bristol Quaker organizer and writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37195/', "Captain George Bishop (d. 1668)")</script>. Their marriage, on 25 March 1672, took place at a Bristol Quaker meeting. Richard and Elizabeth Vickris left Bristol in 1684 and raised their eight or more children at Firgrove, the family estate at Chew Magna, Somerset. There Vickris hosted Quaker meetings, was involved in their administration and the enforcement of discipline, and opposed the schismatic William Rogers. He aided George Fox and William Penn to record Quaker history and &#145;sufferings&#146;.<br>
<br>Before the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689 Vickris publicized the violence and persecution of Quakers that had increased under the prescription of the Restoration settlement. He was detained and fined on several occasions for attending Quaker meetings. Refusing to retract his beliefs and attend the services of the Church of England, he was made an example of when the authorities indicted him under the 1670 <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> (22 Chas. II c. 1) and subsequently tried him under the Elizabethan act of 35 Eliz. I c. 1, against recusants and sectaries, which carried the death penalty for those who refused to abjure their beliefs or depart the realm. This harsh action was instigated by the sheriff of Bristol in 1681&#150;2, Sir John Knight, and may have been propelled by a fanatical hatred of Quakers so extreme that he had once threatened personally to hang Vickris's father-in-law for attending their meetings. Vickris was sentenced to death on 23 August 1684. He and his lawyer used a number of legal tactics to postpone any action that would curb his freedom. Backed by the substantial support of their co-religionists, and in particular of the influential William Penn (a friend of the family whose marriage certificate was to be witnessed by Vickris's brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28380/', "Nathaniel Wade")</script>), Elizabeth Vickris travelled to London and met James, duke of York. The duke used his influence and the case, removed for trial to London under a writ of habeas corpus because of alleged errors in the original indictment in October 1684, was quashed by Sir George Jeffreys the following month. Vickris was the only English Quaker who was threatened with the death penalty for his refusal to conform, though during the reign of Charles II some Baptists also faced death under the act of 35 Elizabeth (and at least 450 Quakers did actually die in disease-ridden gaols or from being beaten up by arresting officers). The Quakers' response to the Vickris case has been cited as a prime example of their legal sophistication in the later Stuart period. In December 1681, in an effort to reconcile Robert Vickris with his son, William Penn wrote an inspirational letter, commending Richard's father for &#145;the sincere love thou hast shown to thy son and his troubles&#146;  (Penn to Robert Vickris, 4 Oct 1681).<br>
<br>Vickris wrote several tracts which, in comparison with those of Quaker contemporaries, are notable for the moderation of their polemics. His most important work, <span class="italic">A Just Reprehension</span> (1691), counters the attack on the Quakers made by the Anglican clergyman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20277/', "John Norris")</script>. Norris, the chief proponent of Malebranche's ideas in England, had dismissed the inner light as &#145;a gross notion&#146;. Vickris died at Chew Magna in April 1700, leaving substantial holdings, including property in Chew Magna and Bristol and elsewhere in Somerset and Gloucestershire. His wife, Elizabeth, lived until 1724. A daughter married into the Dickinson family of Somerset, themselves wealthy members of the gentry, and continued the Quaker beliefs which remained in the family until at least the fourth decade of the eighteenth century.<br>
