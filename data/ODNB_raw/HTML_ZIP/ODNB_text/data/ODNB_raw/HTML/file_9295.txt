<span class="headword">Fenton,  Elijah</span>  (1683&#150;1730), <span class="occ">poet</span>, son of John Fenton, attorney and coroner for the district, and Catherine Maere, was born at Shelton, near Newcastle under Lyme in Staffordshire, on 10 May 1683. His father died in 1694 and evidently left his family in excellent circumstances, for Fenton, the eleventh child of the marriage, entered Jesus College, Cambridge, as a sizar on 1 July 1700, after having attended grammar school at Newcastle under Lyme. He matriculated in 1701 and was awarded the degrees of BA in 1704&#150;5 and MA twenty-one years later in 1726.<br>
<br>Fenton had been intended for the church, but he refused to sign the oaths, probably for religious rather than political reasons. Instead he took employment as assistant to the nonjuror Ambrose Bonwicke the elder, a well-known schoolmaster, at Headley in Surrey. He was with Bonwicke in 1706 and 1707 and left some time before the autumn of 1708 to become headmaster of the grammar school at Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1708, remaining there until the end of the 1711 term. At about this time Bolingbroke suggested he leave Sevenoaks with the promise of better employment. This came to naught. From December 1711 until 1720 he was secretary to Charles Boyle, fourth earl of Orrery, whom he accompanied to Flanders in 1713. From 1714 to 1720 he was tutor to Lord Broghill, the earl's son.<br>
<br>While it is probable that a manuscript poem, or a transcript of it, entitled &#145;Cleopatra&#146;, dated 1700 and signed Elijah Fenton, is indeed by him, Fenton's first publication was &#145;An Ode to the Sea, for the New Year&#146;, a slim volume of thirteen pages (1707), written in praise of Queen Anne and the duke of Marlborough. A more important and extensive publication appeared two years later. The <span class="italic">Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany Poems</span> (1709), edited by Fenton, contained three signed poems by him, as well as a number of others of his, unsigned. The rest of the miscellany was made up of earlier poems by a number of writers, including, among others, John Milton, John Dryden, Thomas Otway, and Matthew Prior. One of Fenton's poems was a pastoral elegy, &#145;Florelio&#146;, a eulogy on the marquess of Blandford, a son of the duke of Marlborough, who died in 1703. Fenton's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>, dedicated to Charles Boyle, fourth earl of Orrery, was published in 1717, and shows the poet trying his hand at various genres, typical of so many other collections with the same title. In 1720&#150;21 he helped Alexander Pope with his edition of Shakespeare, and with the notes on Pope's <span class="italic">Iliad</span>.<br>
<br>At the end of his tenure as tutor to Lord Broghill, Fenton was recommended by Pope to James Craggs the younger, a secretary of state, as one who could make up for any of Craggs's deficiencies in literature. When Craggs died on 16 February 1721, Fenton was again at a loose end. With the translation of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> behind him, Pope had turned his thoughts to the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span>, and enlisted the aid of Fenton and of William Broome. By February 1722 the translation was well under way, but fears that the public knowledge of the collaboration would harm sales of the translation resulted in the issue of proposals as late as 1725. Fenton translated books i, iv, xix, and xx, for which Pope paid him &pound;200. He evidently did not want his share in the translation known; later critics of his part are agreed that his was the worst part of the translation. He had earlier translated the eleventh book of the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span>, &#145;In Milton's Style&#146;, although he did not claim that book as part of his share in the translation. During the period from 1721 to 1725 he was busy working on the tragedy <span class="italic">Mariamne</span>, and on an edition of Edmund Waller's works, started in 1724 and published in 1729.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Mariamne</span> was Fenton's most popular and profitable work. It was begun as closet drama, but, with the encouragement of his friend Thomas Southerne Fenton sought out Colley Cibber, manager of the Drury Lane Theatre, who rudely rejected it. It was, however, accepted at the Lincoln's Inn Theatre in 1723, the <span class="italic">British Journal</span> of 3 March noting that there was present &#145;the greatest Audience ever known at either Theatre&#146; on the occasion of the usual third-night benefit, 25 February 1723. The prologue, by &#145;A Friend&#146;, was by Broome. The play went through many performances and brought Fenton in excess of &pound;1000. It was printed in 1723, with second and third editions in 1726 and 1729. In 1725 he revised the punctuation of several of Milton's works, including <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, with a brief life of the poet, a work that went through a number of editions, the life being translated into French in 1729. He, with Broome, had projected the re-annotating of Dryden's translation of Virgil. Also projected were a translation of Oppian and a tragedy, <span class="italic">Dion</span>.<br>
<br>Partly through Pope's influence, Fenton had in January 1724 become tutor to the son of Lady Trumbull, and remained with the family until his death, brought on by gout, on 16 July 1730 at Easthampstead, Berkshire, where the Trumbulls usually spent the summer and where he was buried. Samuel Johnson praised Fenton as a versifier and poet; other critics were less kind.<br>
