<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pollitt,  Harry</span>  (1890&#150;1960), <span class="occ">political organizer</span>, was born on 22 November 1890 at 14 Wharf Street, Droylsden, near Manchester, the second of six children of Samuel Pollitt (1863&#150;1933), blacksmith's striker, and his wife, Mary Louisa (1868&#150;1939), a cotton spinner, daughter of William Charlesworth, joiner. Pollitt's parents were socialists and freethinkers and it was his mother, a member of the Independent Labour Party, who provided the youngster with his first induction into the principles and local networks of socialism. Theirs was an especially close relationship and Pollitt found in his mother both a confidante and a model of working-class dignity in the face of affliction. His own sense of injustice at family poverty, as three of his siblings died in infancy, was likewise fundamental to the visceral identification with his class that lay at the root of his political philosophy.<br>
<br>Pollitt's formal education, at the local British school, ended when he was thirteen, after a final year spent as a half-timer in a cotton mill. In 1905 he began his apprenticeship at the Gorton Tank locomotive works, also attending evening classes for his City and Guilds qualification. In January 1912 he was admitted as a time-served member of the Boilermakers' Society. This was among the most conservative and exclusive of craft unions, and Pollitt was to remain deeply affected by its traditions of skill and respectability. Nevertheless, his earliest years as a craftsman were ones of acute labour unrest which had a formative influence on so many of his generation. Already Pollitt was an active figure in the Openshaw Socialist Society, and on the outdoor speaking pitches of northern England he had begun to establish his own reputation as one of the finest orators of his generation. Moving from home during the First World War, he had his first real blooding as an industrial militant in the Southampton Boilermakers' strike of 1915. By the time of the Bolshevik revolution two years later, he had moved to east London with its vibrant and heterodox movement of syndicalists and revolutionaries. Through Sylvia Pankhurst and the Workers' Socialist Federation he became heavily involved in the Hands Off Russia movement, briefly as its full-time organizer, as well as holding positions in his union and the River Thames shop stewards' movement.<br>
<br>It was as a leader of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) that Pollitt came to national prominence. A member of the party from its foundation in mid-1920, he remained for some time primarily an industrial activist, but with the expanded range of contacts and organizational resources that communism provided. In June 1921 he made the first of his many trips to Russia as a delegate to the founding congress of the communist-organized Red International of Labour Unions (RILU). The impact of the visit was vividly described in his memoirs, as was that of his fourth visit some two and a half years later, which coincided with the death and obsequies of Lenin. That early loyalty to the Soviet state and leadership was never to waver.<br>
<br>During the 1920s, as secretary of the RILU-affiliated minority movement and as Boilermakers' delegate to labour and TUC conferences, Pollitt was generally recognized as the communists' most effective labour movement figurehead. His wider prominence was further secured in 1925&#150;6, first by his kidnapping by fascists, a brief <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, and then by his sentencing to a year's imprisonment as one of twelve communists charged with sedition. His credibility as a mass leader must greatly have assisted his advancement to the secretaryship of the Communist Party in 1929, though his penchant for plain-speaking also made him a somewhat unpredictable instrument of Moscow's control. Riven by internal disputes and following the Comintern down crazily sectarian paths, the CPGB was at this time at its lowest ebb and Pollitt evinced a robust and sometimes outspoken pragmatism in reorientating it towards the realities of British working-class politics. He also knew better than most how to take Comintern instructions with a pinch of salt. His party's recovery during the 1930s to a position of considerable influence on the British left was due in no small part to these qualities. Well connected with such left-wing luminaries as Harold Laski, Victor Gollancz, and Stafford Cripps, Pollitt succeeded better than any of them in articulating the passionate anti-fascism most famously attested by the communists' efforts for republican Spain. Himself five times a visitor to the British volunteers fighting in Spain, Pollitt's intense commitment to the anti-fascist cause had a sequel in his last and most memorable conflict with the Comintern when in September 1939 it instructed the CPGB to oppose the British war with Germany. With a call to &#145;smash the fascist bastards once and for all&#146;, Pollitt defied both his own comrades and his superiors in Moscow, and for his recalcitrance on this occasion&#151;almost without parallel among his counterparts elsewhere&#151;he was inevitably removed from his position as party secretary  (Morgan, 109).<br>
<br>Instead of breaking with his party, as several non-communist associates hoped or expected, Pollitt in due course issued the recantation demanded of him and gave his voice to the anti-war policy he found so repugnant. It was a defining moment of communist discipline, and in this respect the episode may be said to have broken him. Restored as party secretary with the Russians' entry into the war, he did enjoy a new lease of life as an anti-fascist tribune of the left. Having stood unsuccessfully on several occasions as a Communist parliamentary candidate (Seaham, 1929; Stepney, 1930, 1931; Clay Cross, 1933; West Ham, 1940), he came very close to wresting from Labour its parliamentary stronghold of Rhondda East at the 1945 general election. Nevertheless, what Pollitt now lacked was the ability to finesse the &#145;international line&#146; when it took the British party into the disastrous backwater of cold war Stalinism. After a period of remarkable wartime growth, the CPGB now entered an apparently inexorable cycle of decline which Pollitt could neither arrest, understand, nor even acknowledge. Seemingly a permanent fixture at the margins of British politics, he needed the shock of Khrushchov's 1956 secret speech before at last he stood down as party leader.<br>
<br>It was not however because of the crimes of Stalinism which Khrushchov revealed. For Pollitt more than most British communists, it was not entirely news that all had not been right with Stalin's communism. Most poignantly, he had several times in the 1920s proposed to a communist research worker called Rose Cohen, who was sucked instead into the maelstrom of Stalin's terror through her ill-fated preference for the Comintern representative Petrovsky. Her sentencing by the Soviet authorities, though not her death, was made known to British communists in 1937, but even in the case of a woman he had loved, Pollitt's private representations were not accompanied by any public protest or disavowal. Having maintained his discipline in these most testing of circumstances, he was barely to waver when news or rumours reached him of similar outrages after the war. Morally he was inured to Stalinism, and Khrushchov's revelations disillusioned him not in Stalin but in Khrushchov himself for telling the story of his crimes. &#145;He's staying there as long as I'm alive&#146;, he said of the portrait of Stalin that hung in his living room, and stay there he did  (Morgan, 176).<br>
<br>Personable and well-liked by non-communists, Pollitt somehow linked the open, generous socialist culture of the industrial Britain of his youth with the harsher disciplines of international communism and the sheer brutal cynicism of the Stalin era. In his tastes and in his famously down-to-earth demeanour he was the &#145;true son of the British working class&#146; that communist propaganda claimed, but no less true in his devotion to Stalinism. His private life, on the surface, was less complex. In 1925, rejected by Rose Cohen, he married Marjory Edna Brewer (<i>b</i>. 1902), a communist schoolteacher, and they had a son and a daughter, the first of whom alone inherited his father's communist convictions. Harry Pollitt died of a cerebral haemorrhage, after years of worsening health, while returning on SS <i>Orion</i> from a speaking tour of Australia on 27 June 1960. He was cremated at Golders Green on 9 July, and was survived by his wife.<br>
