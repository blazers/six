<span class="headword">Jearsey,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1690), <span class="occ">merchant and East India Company servant</span>, was the younger son of John Jearsey (<i>d</i>. 1653), brewer of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1661).<br>
<br>Little is known about Jearsey's early career. In 1650 he served on board a privately owned ship on a voyage from the Indian port of Masulipatam to Pegu in Burma. That there is no mention of him in the East India Company's records suggests that Jearsey was not a company servant at his departure, but probably worked his way out to Asia. Furthermore he is not mentioned in his father's will (15 October 1652), indicating a possible break between father and son.<br>
<br>Between 1653 and 1655 Jearsey served the East India Company at Siriam in Burma and was probably head of the English factory there. When the directors decided to close the factory and recall its personnel, he refused to leave. He delayed his departure until 1657, apparently using the company's money in his private trading ventures. His conduct led to conflicts with the directors in London as well as with the council at Fort St George. He was dismissed and lived for some time as a free merchant in Madras. About 1658 Jearsey married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1688), a Dutchwoman about whom further details are unknown aside from her abilities as a merchant in her own right.<br>
<br>In 1662 Jearsey was reconciled with the East India Company and was appointed chief of the factory in Masulipatam, at that time the second most important English settlement on the Coromandel coast after Madras. Devoting himself to his work, Jearsey became a prominent merchant in Masulipatam and a leading figure in the promotion of English private trade in Asia. His mercantile adventures were extensive and directed towards markets in the Bay of Bengal and Persia. Hitherto, historians have claimed that Jearsey obtained his investment capital from embezzling the company's funds, but he had an additional source of income. Between 1662 and 1669 he played an important part in establishing the Anglo-Indian diamond trade. As the leading English commissioner in India, he administered substantial amounts of money and bought diamonds on behalf of merchants in the City of London, charging a 7 per cent commission. In the late 1660s he appears to have run into financial difficulties, prompting him to cheat the London merchants by using their money in his private trade before purchasing diamonds and taking 12 per cent in commission instead of the normal 7 per cent (letter-book of John Chomley, 31 January 1668). Owing to their ensuing mistrust, the diamond merchants stopped using him as commissioner in 1669. The same year he was dismissed from the company's service and charged with embezzlement. Both were fatal blows to his private situation and substantially reduced his private trading activities. On the arrival of his successor Richard Mohun in July 1670, Jearsey refused to hand over the factory's account books. In November, suspecting that Jearsey was attempting to conceal his embezzlement, Mohun warned him to produce the accounts immediately or have his estate seized in order to meet the company's claims. When he did not comply, some of his ships were seized and goods confiscated. In March 1671 he left Masulipatam and began his journey towards Madras, &#145;with his Colours flying, Drum, Trumpets, Pipes and Horns sounding&#146; as if he still had the esteem of the company. Although he lived in Madras as a free merchant for the following twenty years and was regarded as a man of substance, he never recovered his leading position among the English private merchants. In spite of ongoing requests from London, Jearsey never furnished the accounts from Masulipatam; instead, he sued the company for having illegally seized his property. This case lasted several years and ended in October 1685, when the council at Madras, unable to prove his embezzlement, offered him a compensation of 3000 pagodas.<br>
<br>During his life in India William Jearsey acquired a mixed reputation. He was a skilful merchant, but also insubordinate with a fiery temperament, capable of any action in order to protect his position. Upon his being appointed chief of the factory in Masulipatam in 1662, the directors praised his honesty and abilities, but the diamond merchant John Chomley claimed &#145;by Mr. Jearsey's own friends&#146; to have learned that &#145;he will promise you faire but perform little&#146;  (letter-book of John Chomley, 27 Dec 1665). During Sir Edward Winter's usurpation of the government in Madras in 1665, Jearsey actively supported the rightfully appointed agent George Foxcroft. His actions impressed the directors and probably contributed to Jearsey's being allowed to remain in India after his dismissal. His wife, Catherine, died in September 1688 and was buried in St Mary's churchyard in Madras. Jearsey died a little over two years later, in December 1690, and was buried beside her. The couple had no children and there is no record of a will. He left no fortune although he lived more than forty years in India.<br>
