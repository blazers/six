<span class="headword">Wells,  Henry Lake</span>  (1850&#150;1898), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of Thomas Bury Wells, rector of Portlemouth, Devon, and his wife, Catharine Frances, daughter of the Revd William Stockdale (fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge), was born on 8 March 1850. After attending the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich he was commissioned lieutenant into the Royal Engineers on 2 August 1871, was captain in 1883, major in 1889, and lieutenant-colonel on 6 November 1896. He was specially employed in the War Office in 1873 and 1874, and went to India in 1875.<br>
<br>Wells served in the Afghan campaign of 1878&#150;9, raised a corps of Ghilzai labourers, and constructed a road across the Khojak Pass, and was for some time in sole charge of the public works department at Quetta. He commanded detachments of Punjab cavalry and Sind horse in an engagement near the Khojak, where he was wounded. He accompanied General Biddulph's force down the Thal-Chotiali route, took part in the action at Baghao, served with the Khyber line force, was present at the action of Majina, and had charge of the positions at the crossing of the Kabul River. He was five times mentioned in dispatches, Sir Donald Stewart recommending him &#145;for conspicuous gallantry and bravery&#146;.<br>
<br>Wells surveyed routes in 1879&#150;80 in Kashmir and Gilgit for a telegraph line, and in the latter year was appointed to the government Indo-European telegraph service in Persia as assistant director. During many years spent in Persia he surveyed routes between Dezful and Shiraz, and contributed papers to the Royal Geographical Society, the Society of Arts, and to the Royal Engineers' professional papers. He was repeatedly thanked for his services, especially for those rendered in the delimitation of the Afghan frontier in 1886, the army remount operations for India in 1887, in the cholera epidemic, and during the revolt in Shiraz in 1893. Wells married, on 15 January 1885, in London, Alice Bertha, daughter of the Revd Hugh Bacon.<br>
<br>Wells became director of the Persian telegraph service in 1891. He was presented by Shah Nasir al-Din with a sword of honour, and by Shah Muraffer with a diamond ring. On 1 January 1897 he was made CIE. He died suddenly at Karachi on 31 August 1898.<br>
