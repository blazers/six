<span class="headword">Hollingsworth,  Dorothy Frances</span>  (1916&#150;1994), <span class="occ">nutritionist and civil servant</span>, was born on 10 May 1916 at 15 Honister Avenue, Newcastle upon Tyne, the daughter of Arthur Hollingsworth, pharmacist, and his wife, Dorothy Coldwell. After secondary education at Newcastle upon Tyne Church High School she entered King's College, Newcastle (Durham University), where she achieved a second-class BSc honours degree in chemistry in 1937. She dropped her original intention of becoming a teacher and, at the suggestion of her general practitioner who regarded nutrition as an up-and-coming field, decided to take the diploma of dietetics at the school of dietetics in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, under the pioneer dietician Sister Ruth Pybus. This course involved three months at the domestic science college at Atholl Crescent, as well as some teaching by members of Edinburgh University's biochemistry department, and some nursing experience.<br>
<br>Hollingsworth qualified in 1939 and three months later obtained a temporary unpaid summer locum post in the Royal Northern Hospital, London. After the outbreak of war, however, she stayed on, becoming the senior dietician running the hospital's dietetics department, before successfully applying for a job with the Ministry of Food in 1941. She joined a group in the ministry's statistics division, working on the Wartime Food Survey, based at Colwyn Bay in north Wales. The aim of the survey, begun in July 1940, was to find out how well the population was coping with wartime food rationing. Hollingsworth learned about statistics and economics from her colleagues in the ministry and was initially responsible for working out, from the survey findings, the nutritional composition of the food consumed and the implication of the results. The data were collected by the London Press Exchange on behalf of the ministry, and at first only urban working-class households in seven cities were included. In 1945 the exercise was continued as the Family Food Survey, and in 1950 it was extended to a national sample of the population, becoming the National Food Survey. The survey was used to assess the effects of the end of rationing in 1954, and gave rise to some concern about the deterioration of the diet of poorer and larger families. It became a valued resource not only for government, but also for scientists and the food industry. Hollingsworth was associated with the survey throughout her period in government service, and later continued to be a member of and consultant to the National Food Survey Committee.<br>
<br>In 1945 Hollingsworth and the nutritional part of the food survey were transferred to the scientific adviser's division of the Ministry of Food under Sir Jack Drummond. In 1949 she succeeded Magnus Pyke as principal scientific officer in the division in charge, and took charge of its nutrition bureau. She remained responsible for a range of nutrition-related work for the next twenty-one years, during which time there was a series of divisional reorganizations. Other administrative changes included the merger of the Ministry of Food with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to form the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1955. Latterly Hollingsworth's title was head of food science advice branch. Her remit covered all aspects of scientific information in nutrition, and aspects of food science, statistics, and education. Her responsibilities varied over time but included a laboratory concerned with the nutritional value of food, an experimental kitchen and taste-panel studies, an experimental factory in Aberdeen which made dehydrated foods, and food defence work. In 1958 she was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>In 1970 Hollingsworth left the civil service and was appointed director of the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF), an organization which aimed to emulate a body funded by the food industry in the United States. The BNF had been founded in 1967 on the initiative of Alastair Frazer, professor of medical biochemistry and pharmacology at Birmingham University, who was the first director-general. Hollingsworth succeeded Frazer after he died in 1969, and she remained in the post until 1977. The BNF hoped to disburse funds for nutritional research donated from industry, on the basis of the advice of an independent scientific committee. However, insufficient money was forthcoming for this objective to be pursued on any scale. The organization then began to concentrate on educational activities. Hollingsworth had to keep up to date with knowledge while responding to enquiries from the press and other sources and organizing events on behalf of the foundation. With only a small staff she found this frustrating and tiring.<br>
<br>Hollingsworth edited two volumes based on BNF conferences, <span class="italic">Nutritional Problems in a Changing World</span> (1973) and, with Elizabeth Morse, <span class="italic">People and Food Tomorrow</span> (1976). Earlier, in 1957, she published the revised edition of a work by Jack Drummond and Anne Wilbraham, <span class="italic">The Englishman's Food: a History of Five Centuries of English Diet</span>. This had first been published in 1939, and Hollingsworth added a chapter updating the book. In 1969, with Hugh Sinclair, she published <span class="italic">Food and the Principles of Nutrition</span>, a revised edition of Robert Hutchison's <span class="italic">Food and the Principles of Dietetics</span>.<br>
<br>Hollingsworth was a member of many professional and scientific organizations. She served as chairman of the British Dietetic Association (1947&#150;9) and as honorary secretary of the Nutrition Society (1962&#150;5). She was a member of the dietetics board of the Council for Professions Supplementary for Medicine (1962&#150;74), and the joint Agricultural Research Council and Medical Research Council committee on food and nutrition research (1970&#150;74). She was a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Biology, and the Institute of Food Science and Technology. After her formal retirement she served as secretary-general of the International Union of Nutritional Sciences. Her recreations as given in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> included talking to intelligent and humorous friends, appreciation of music, theatre, countryside, and gardening&#151;interests reflected in her membership of the University Women's Club and the Arts Theatre Club. She died at Bromley Hospital, Bromley, Kent, on 16 February 1994. She was unmarried.<br>
