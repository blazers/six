</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bax, Sir  Arnold Edward Trevor</span>  (1883&#150;1953), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 8 November 1883 in Heath Villa, Angles Road, Streatham, London, the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844&#150;1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen Lea (1860&#150;1940). His father was a barrister of the Middle Temple, though having a private income he never practised. His youngest brother, Clifford Lea Bax (1886&#150;1962), in his day was a celebrated playwright and essayist. In 1896 the family moved to a Hampstead mansion, Ivy Bank, whose gardens and ambience coloured the teens and early twenties of the children.<h2>
<a name="Earlymusic"></a>Early music</h2>In his autobiography, <span class="italic">Farewell, my Youth</span> (1943), Bax could not remember the time when he was not able to read music at the piano, and he showed an easy musical facility from an early age, encouraged by his mother. He attended the Hampstead Conservatoire (from 1898), and in September 1900 entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he remained until the summer of 1905. At the academy he was a composition pupil of Frederick Corder and a piano pupil of Tobias Matthay. He won the Battison Haynes prize (1902) and a Macfarren scholarship (1902). Later he won the Charles Lucas medal with his <span class="italic">Variations for Orchestra</span> (1904), rehearsed at the Royal College of Music under the Patron's Fund scheme, in May 1905, an occasion vividly described in Bax's autobiography. The work was otherwise never performed, but survives. Later he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy of Music (1911) and a fellow (1927).<br>
<br>In 1902 Bax discovered the poetry of W. B. Yeats, and under its influence explored the west of Ireland, where the remote Donegal coastal village of Glencolumcille became a constant refuge from the world. Here he learned the Irish language and wrote &#145;Celtic twilight&#146; poetry, short stories, and plays, influenced by Yeats, J. M. Synge and A. E. (George Russell). Bax used a variety of Irish pseudonyms which evolved into &#145;Dermot O'Byrne&#146;, under which name he published such work from 1909 (and in the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span> in 1913).<br>
<br>Bax's financial independence freed him from ever taking a paid position, and he was able to travel. Soon he visited Germany, and at Dresden in 1906 attended an early performance of Richard Strauss's <span class="italic">Salome</span>. His early travels, vividly evoked in his autobiography, ended when he visited St Petersburg and the Ukraine in the spring of 1910 in pursuit of a Ukrainian girl. But on 28 January 1911 he married Elsa Luisa Sobrino (<i>b</i>. 1885/6), daughter of a pianist, Carlos Sobrino, and his wife, Luisa, a well-known singer of the day; they set up house in a suburb of Dublin. They had two children, Dermot (1912&#150;1976) and Maeve Astrid 
    (later Rosenberg; 1913&#150;1987)
  . Here Bax became well known in literary circles, publishing vivid stories, verse, and a Synge-like play, all reflecting a first-hand knowledge of the language, customs, legends, and history of the west of Ireland. His particular friends were Padraig and Mary Colum, who had started the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span> in 1912.<br>
<br>Bax made his reputation with a succession of vivid orchestral tone poems, largely on Irish and nature themes, which first came to general notice when Sir Henry Wood conducted <span class="italic">In the Faery Hills</span> at the Promenade Concerts in 1910. This had been preceded by a number of other similar orchestral scores. The first of these was <span class="italic">Cathaleen-ni-Hoolihan</span>, a student work first written as the slow movement of an early quartet in E, later reworked as a tone poem for two violins and piano, and then revised as an orchestral tone poem. It remained unperformed until 1970, but is now revealed as already exhibiting many of the elements of his later works in the form.<br>
<br>In an autobiographical radio talk (recorded on 6 May 1949) Bax described the influence of Ireland in finding his style: he began &#145;using figures of a definitely Celtic curve, an idiom which in the end was &hellip; second nature to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Farewell</span>, 165). In his mid-twenties Bax tended to be a musical magpie, celebrating his latest discoveries in new compositions, in which his musical personality was so strong that any influences instantly became his own. Thus he assimilated Wagner, Strauss, the Russian &#145;Five&#146; (Balakirev, Borodin, Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov), Glazunov, Debussy and Ravel, Sibelius and early Stravinsky. Many of these influences were probably first encountered at the keyboard: Bax was so commanding a pianist, fluently reading full scores on the keyboard at sight, that he was called in for piano rehearsals of all manner of new works, which were instantly grist to his mill. Along with many others, Bax was dazzled by the brilliance of the Diaghilev ballet, first seen in the summer of 1911. By the outbreak of war in August 1914 the music of Debussy, Ravel, and the young Stravinsky had provided the examples for a significant development of his musical language, first seen in the five-movement tone poem <span class="italic">Spring Fire</span> (1913).<br>
<br>In 1911, emulating what he had seen during Diaghilev's first London season, Bax had written his own Russian ballet, &#145;a little-Russian fairy tale in action and dance&#146; which he called <span class="italic">Tamara</span>. It survives only in piano score, and its thirty numbers would have run for about two hours. It was never orchestrated or produced, for when the summer ballet season of 1912 was announced, the appearance of Balakirev's <span class="italic">Thamar</span> made all competitors redundant. However, the music was to inform other later scores, and a suite, orchestrated by Graham Parlett, demonstrates how at the time Bax had swallowed his Russian models whole. When after the war he wrote spoof Russian ballet music for J. M. Barrie's whimsical play <span class="italic">The Truth about the Russian Dancers</span>, as a vehicle for the ballerina Tamara Karsavina, he used some of the music of <span class="italic">Tamara</span>, including its most romantic tune.<h2>
<a name="TheFirstWorldWarandtheEasterrising"></a>The First World War and the Easter rising</h2>During the First World War, Bax was a non-combatant. A heart condition, which troubled him intermittently all his life, kept him from the trenches. This meant that at a time when many of his contemporaries were serving overseas, he was able to produce a remarkable body of music as he found his technical and artistic maturity in his early thirties. In addition to piano music, this included his large-scale piano quintet, two violin sonatas, songs, and orchestral tone poems such as <span class="italic">The Garden of Fand</span>, <span class="italic">Nympholept</span>, <span class="italic">November Woods</span>, <span class="italic">Tintagel</span>, and the fifty-minute <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span> for piano and orchestra.<br>
<br>While living in Dublin, Bax had many republican friends, and although he returned to England in August 1914, the Easter rising in April 1916 and the execution of the leaders on 3 May came as a tremendous shock. This event was reflected in a variety of Bax's music, most notably in the orchestral <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> (&#145;In memoriam Padraig Pearse&#146;), which remained largely unknown until recorded by Vernon Handley in 1998. More love song than elegy, this is a remarkably passionate piece, dominated by a tune which Bax later reused in his music for the 1948 film of <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>; but this was not his only elegy for Irish friends. Various chamber works, such as the <span class="italic">Elegiac Trio</span> for flute, viola, and harp (1916), the harp quintet (1919), and the sextet for cor anglais, harp, and strings called <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> (1917), were also elegiac. Other pieces which contemporary commentators viewed as &#145;war&#146; works, such as the stormy first symphony, first performed in 1922, and the second, given four years later, should also appear in this category.<br>
<br>As well as music reflecting the Irish tragedy, there was a pamphlet of verse written under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne, <span class="italic">A Dublin Ballad and other Poems</span>, that was banned by the British censor in Ireland. The middle verse of the poem &#145;Shells at Oranmore&#146;, dated April 1916, was later chosen by the Irish department of external affairs as the motto for the issue of its weekly bulletin marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter rising in 1966.<h2>
<a name="Creativematurity"></a>Creative maturity</h2>After the First World War, Bax was able to write new works in rapid succession. He produced two piano sonatas; starting work on a third in 1921, he found he had conceived a symphony, and the work was orchestrated, and first performed in December 1922. The fiery character of the music seems to suggest conflict, and while contemporary commentators associated it with the First World War, it is now generally felt to reflect events in Ireland. A similarly epic second symphony followed and was in short score by October 1924, though not completed in full score until 1926. It was first performed in Boston in December 1929, but was not heard in London until May 1930, two months after the premi&egrave;re of the third symphony. The fact that at one point it alludes to <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> of 1916 suggests that it too may have had an Irish genesis.<br>
<br>Bax was at his musical peak for a comparatively short time, and his fame as a symphonist really dates from the 1930s, when his reputation was soon overtaken by Vaughan Williams and Walton. But in the 1920s he was widely considered the leading British composer of his generation, and between the wars he produced most of his mature works. In a magazine interview in 1928 he described himself as a &#145;brazen romantic&#146;. Strangely enough he did not take the opportunity in the 1930s to bring forward what subsequently became known to be his large number of pre-war works, and they remained unperformed until after his death.<br>
<br>Bax's third symphony was completed in 1929 and after its first performance in 1930 was championed as one of his most frequently heard major works; it was his first symphony to be recorded (1943). Four more symphonies followed: the fourth (1931, first performed in San Francisco in 1932), the fifth (1932, first performed in 1934), the sixth (1935), and the seventh (1939, but not performed in England until a broadcast in 1941 and a Promenade Concert in 1943). Other works written in the 1930s include the popular <span class="italic">Overture to a Picaresque Comedy</span>, a variety of chamber works for larger groups, including a nonet, a string quintet (1933), the third string quartet, and an octet for horn, piano, and strings. Bax's violin concerto was completed in 1938 but not performed until 1943, when Eda Kersey played the solo part.<br>
<br>Bax was always indifferent to formal honours, but during the 1930s he received the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society (1931), the Cobbett medal for chamber music (1931), and honorary doctorates from the universities of Oxford (1934) and Durham (1935) and the National University of Ireland (1947). He was knighted (June 1937) and appointed KCVO (1953). After the death of Walford Davies, he was appointed master of the king's music in 1942.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Bax developed an increasingly passionate affair with the pianist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32480/', "Harriet Pearl Alice Cohen (1895&#150;1967)")</script>, and in 1918 he left his wife and children and found rooms at Swiss Cottage, London, where he lived until the onset of the Second World War. His relationship with Harriet Cohen cooled, though he wrote many works for her; her name remained coupled with his, and she became identified with his piano music during his lifetime. In 1926 Bax met Mary Gleaves (1904&#150;1995), who although unmusical formed another emotional thread for the rest of his life; it was she who accompanied Bax in the 1930s to his winter retreat in Morar, Inverness-shire, where he orchestrated works written in London. Bax kept Mary's existence from Harriet Cohen, who found out only in 1948.<h2>
<a name="Neglectandrevival"></a>Neglect and revival</h2>At the outset of the Second World War, Bax stopped composing, moved to Sussex, and produced his autobiography, which presents his life only to the age of thirty. During the war he was persuaded to turn to film music and wrote the score for <span class="italic">Malta, GC</span>, from which extracts were promoted on the radio and in the concert hall. After the war he wrote a number of further works, including the popular music for David Lean's film <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> (1948) and the short <span class="italic">Morning Song</span> and concertante for piano (left hand) and orchestra, all three for Harriet Cohen. It was at this time that he wrote the concertante for three winds and orchestra, consisting of three movements that feature successively cor anglais, clarinet, and French horn, followed by a finale combining all three.<br>
<br>Bax died on 3 October 1953 at Glen House, Ballyvolane, Cork, Ireland; he was there as a visiting examiner at the University of Cork. He was buried at St Finbarr's cemetery, Cork. After his death his reputation was kept alive by just one work, the orchestral tone poem <span class="italic">Tintagel</span>. This neglect was compounded when his publisher, Chappell &amp; Co., suffered a disastrous fire in 1964, which destroyed the printed stocks of most of his music. The gradual revival of Bax's music started with Vernon Handley's performances of the fourth symphony and other works at Guildford, and with the pioneering recordings by Lyrita Recorded Edition of the first, second, fifth, sixth, and seventh symphonies. This movement was developed with the exploration of the unknown and early orchestral works by the conductor Leslie Head in the 1970s and by the monographs by Colin Scott-Sutherland (1973) and Lewis Foreman (1983). The Bax centenary in 1983 was celebrated by twelve BBC programmes, which revealed to a wide audience the richness of the less well-known scores, and with the establishment of the Sir Arnold Bax Trust in 1985 the mechanism was in place for promoting the Chandos Records cycle of Bax's music conducted by Bryden Thomson, Vernon Handley, and Martyn Brabbins, which has promoted Bax to a world audience.<br>
