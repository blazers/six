<span class="headword">Coffey,  Aeneas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1780&#150;1852), <span class="occ">exciseman and inventor of a still</span>, was born probably in Dublin (though one source gives his birthplace as Calais), the son of Andrew Coffey, the city engineer of Dublin, who was employed in the Dublin city waterworks from 1774 to 1832. He is thought to have attended classes at Trinity College, Dublin, but there is no record of his having graduated from there.<br>
<br>Coffey entered the service of the excise in 1800 as a waiter, gauger, and searcher. In 1808 he married Sussana Logie. They had four sons. Coffey was appointed surveyor of excise for the city of Dublin in 1809, and in the following year was transferred to co. Donegal, where he was put in charge of operations against illicit distilling. The excise laws were widely regarded by the Irish as unnecessarily strict, and they resulted in harsh repressive measures being taken by excise officers, often in conjunction with military forces, although there is ample evidence that both sides resorted to violence at times. The Revd Edward Chichester published a pamphlet in 1818 entitled <span class="italic">Oppressions and Cruelties of Irish Revenue Officers</span>, in which he described how, in 1810, a detachment of the army led by Coffey was set upon and disarmed by the country people near Culdaff in Inishowen. Coffey was beaten &#145;until he was supposed to be dead&#146;. That same year Coffey, by then acting inspector-general of excise, published his <span class="italic">Observations</span>, on Chichester's pamphlet, in which he restated the official policy but did not produce any very convincing arguments or evidence in its justification.<br>
<br>In 1821 Coffey began a series of experiments at Carrickfergus distillery on the design of a new type of still, which allowed the distiller to check the strength of the spirit without requiring access to it, while securing the still against any abstraction of the contents. Coffey's objective was to reduce illicit distilling, but his apparatus had obvious commercial advantages over the traditional pot still; it produced whisky more quickly and cheaply, in larger quantities, and in a continuous process. In 1824 he resigned from the excise and four years later established the firm of Aeneas Coffey &amp; Co. at the Dock Distillery, South King Street, Dublin. The patent for his &#145;apparatus for brewing and distilling&#146; (no. 5974) was granted (for Ireland only) for fourteen years from 1831.<br>
<br>Initial production problems and the conservatism of Irish distillers meant that Coffey had little success in introducing his apparatus in Ireland, and in 1835 he moved his business to St Leonard's Street, Bromley by Bow, Middlesex. From the 1840s his patent still gained in popularity, notably in Scotland. During his tour of 1887 Alfred Barnard found Coffey stills in all the major Scottish distilleries. Improved versions are widely used in the manufacture of grain whisky, gin, and other potable and industrial spirits.<br>
<br>Coffey's four sons all entered their father's business, three of them after studying at Trinity College, Dublin. Coffey died at St Leonard's Street, Bromley by Bow, on 26 November 1852, his eldest son, Aeneas Coffey, having died a few months earlier.<br>
