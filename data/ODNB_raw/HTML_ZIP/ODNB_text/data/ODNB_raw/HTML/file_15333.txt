<span class="headword">Kemp <span class="st"> [Kempe]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1601), <span class="occ">writer on education</span>, was the son of Walter Kempe of Devon or Cornwall. He is not to be confused with another William Kempe, master of Colchester grammar school between 1598 and 1637. Kemp the writer was very probably educated at Plymouth grammar school under William Minterne. In June 1578 he matriculated as a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, but migrated to Trinity Hall, where he graduated BA in 1580/81 and MA in 1584. From 1581 to 1601 Kemp acted as master of Plymouth grammar school, where he was paid a salary of &pound;20.<br>
<br>Kemp is remembered chiefly as the author of pioneering works on the theory and practice of education. He was an apostle of the systems of Ramus, fashionable at Cambridge in the 1560s and 1570s, and his work also bears the influence of Plutarch. It has been very plausibly supposed that William Minterne, himself a graduate of Christ's, had brought Ramism from the college to Plymouth and that it was he who introduced Kemp to the doctrine even before the boy went up to his former college. Kemp's most notable book was <span class="italic">The Education of Children in Learning</span> (1588), dedicated to the mayor and corporation of Plymouth. He was concerned for the education of boys (not girls) from yeoman and merchant, as well as landed backgrounds. Kemp was extremely keen that schooling should be both accessible and challenging, and hoped his book &#145;may teach the unlearned with some delight and not be tedious to those that are learned&#146;  (Kempe, <span class="italic">Education</span>, sig. A3). But he also believed, as in the book of <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>, that &#145;Foolishness is tied in the heart of the child, but the rod of discipline shall drive it away&#146;  (ibid., title-page).<br>
<br>There are several indications of Kemp's preference for broadening the traditional curriculum, though classical studies remained central. &#145;What is music in sounds, in harmony, and in their spaces, concords and divers sorts, but only arithmetic in hearing?&#146;, he asked, though music found no more place in his school curriculum than anywhere else  (Watson, 212). He recommended that for three years from the age of twelve boys should study logic and rhetoric. The bulk of their time, however, should be spent not on learning theoretical systems but in reading such authors as Cicero, Virgil, and Horace. Kemp was unusual in recommending the intensive study of arithmetic and geometry for six months, at the age of fifteen. He produced the only contemporary translation of Ramus's arithmetical texts into English, enthusiastically describing the author as &#145;that worthy ornament of arts and all good learning in our time&#146;  (Kempe, <span class="italic">Art of Arithmetic</span>, A3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In addition to his works on education Kemp produced <span class="italic">A Dutiful Invective Against the Moste Haynous Treasons of Ballard and Babington</span> (1587), which contains a preface addressed to George Barne, lord mayor of London, inveighing against &#145;the treacherous dealing of that ungodlie disposed woman, the Scottish queen, with the sentence pronounced against her at Fotheringhay and confirmed by her majesty&#146;. His patriotism was of a deeply Calvinist colour, full of confidence that (as he wrote in his will) God &#145;hath beautified me with the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so made me an heir of thy blessed life to come&#146;. Kemp acquired several properties in Plymouth and furnished his executors with an inventory of his estate, which, after payment of his debts, he estimated to be worth &pound;540. Dividing it into seven parts, he left two parts to his wife and five to be held in trust for his children, to be allocated when they reached adulthood, with no distinction of age or gender. In the meantime, careful provision was made for &#145;the good education of my children in the fear of God&#146;. Kemp died between 24 July 1601, when he signed his will, and the grant of probate on 18 November; his wife, whose name was Joan, and five of their children survived him.<br>
