<span class="headword">Brooke, Sir  William  O'Shaughnessy</span>  (1808&#150;1889), <span class="occ">doctor and promoter of telegraphy in India</span>, was born William O'Shaughnessy at Limerick in October 1808, the son of Daniel S. O'Shaughnessy of Limerick and his wife, Sara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boswell. His uncle was dean of Ennis and his great-uncle Roman Catholic bishop of Killaloe.<br>
<br>O'Shaughnessy graduated MD from Edinburgh University in 1829. In 1831, at the request of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, he made a study of blood samples from cholera patients in Newcastle upon Tyne, concluding that patients in the early stages of cholera should be given copious amounts of tepid water infused with neutral salts. In 1830 and 1831 he also published a series of reviews on the detection of poisons in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and a translation of Lugol's <span class="italic">Essay on the Effects of Iodine in Scrofulous Diseases</span>. It was probably around this time that he married his first wife, Isabella (1805/6&#150;1834); they had at least one child. In August 1833 he joined the Bengal army as an assistant surgeon and shortly after arriving in India was appointed professor of chemistry and medicine at the Calcutta medical college. For a time he was also employed as first assistant in the government's opium factory at Bihar and as physician to Sir Charles Metcalfe.<br>
<br>O'Shaughnessy was a creative and imaginative scientist. In 1837, when it was widely held that India's terrain and climate would defeat electric systems of communication, he laid 30 miles of wire at his own expense to prove that the telegraph would work there. He published his results in the journal of the Asiatic Society, but, at the time, was unable to arouse any official enthusiasm in his experiments. In 1841, in connection with his duties at the medical college, he published a <span class="italic">Manual of Chemistry</span> designed to put the latest European practice and laboratory techniques within financial reach of Indian students. He followed this work with <span class="italic">The Bengal Dispensatory</span> (1842) and <span class="italic">The Bengal Pharmacopoeia</span> (1844), and by 1843 was sufficiently respected by his peers to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In the same year he obtained a position in the refinery of the Calcutta mint and while there devised a new, more economical means of parting and refining gold coin. Unhappily, however, the coveted job of assay master eluded him and by 1849 he was desperate for more lucrative employment. His first wife, Isabella, had died at Calcutta on 30 August 1834, but he had remarried in the following year; his new wife was Margaret, daughter of Francis O'Shaughnessy of Curragh, co. Clare, and by 1849 was father to a large and expensive family.<br>
<br>Aware of Lord Dalhousie's keenness to establish the telegraph in India, O'Shaughnessy asked his principal patron, H. H. Wilson, to bring his 1837 experiments to the attention of the court of directors. Dalhousie leapt at the offer of O'Shaughnessy's experience and in March 1850 authorized him to proceed with an experimental line. In 1852 he succeeded in establishing communication between Calcutta and Diamond Harbour, 80 miles distant, whereupon Dalhousie sent him to London to win the court of directors' approval for an all-India network. Upon his return, Dalhousie appointed him superintendent of electric telegraphs. Work commenced in November 1853. In spite of the lack of trained staff (because of manpower shortages, O'Shaughnessy was forbidden from hiring covenanted civil servants or soldiers), the first telegram from Agra reached Calcutta, 800 miles away, on 24 March 1854. By the following February, Calcutta was linked to Agra, Bombay, Madras, and Attock on the north-west frontier, a remarkable technological feat involving the laying of over 3050 miles of wiring through jungles, across deserts, and over unbridged rivers. Soon after, O'Shaughnessy was to hear both Indians and Britons acknowledge the telegraph as a key factor in Britain's victory over the rebels of 1857.<br>
<br>In 1856 O'Shaughnessy was knighted and in 1859 promoted to surgeon-major. He retired to England in 1861, in which year he assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Brooke. He died at 4 Clarence Parade, Southsea, Portsea, Southampton, on 8 January 1889 and was survived by his third wife, Julia Greenly, daughter of Captain John Sabine of the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers.<br>
