<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pakington <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Russell]</span>,  John Somerset</span>, first Baron Hampton  (1799&#150;1880), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Slaughter's Court, Powick, Worcestershire, on 20 February 1799, the second son of William Russell (<i>d</i>. 1812) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1813), daughter of Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington, seventh baronet. Orphaned in his early teens, after attending Eton College Russell was admitted at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1818. On the death of his elder brother, William Herbert Russell, in 1819, however, he became heir to the family estates and left the university without a degree to take up the life of a country gentleman. In his young manhood he adopted the style of a dandy and was nicknamed Mr Brummell. On 14 August 1822 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1843), only child of Moreton Aglionby Slaney of Shifnal, Shropshire, with whom he had a son (born in 1826). He fought a duel in 1827, reputedly the last such event in Worcestershire. On 14 March 1831 he assumed the name of Pakington in lieu of Russell, having inherited in the previous year, jointly with his maternal aunt, the estates of his uncle, Sir John Pakington, eighth baronet. These included Westwood Park, near Droitwich, Worcestershire, which became his seat.<h2>
<a name="Intoparliament"></a>Into parliament</h2>After three failed attempts to enter parliament&#151;for East Worcestershire in December 1832 and for West Worcestershire in May 1833 and January 1835&#151;at the general election in July 1837 Pakington was elected Conservative MP for Droitwich, the seat he was to hold until 1874. He made his first Commons speech the following January (1838). Its subject, Canada, marked the beginning of a long interest in colonial issues: in 1841 he secured a select committee to inquire into the state of Newfoundland; the following year he chaired the select committee appointed to investigate the depression in the sugar plantations of the West Indies; and in 1848 he sat on Lord George Bentinck's select committee which examined the grievances of the colonial planters.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, on 4 June 1844 Pakington married Augusta Anne (1817&#150;1848), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19609/', "George Murray")</script>, bishop of Rochester. During their short marriage they had a son and daughter. On 5 June 1851 he married his third wife, Augusta (1799&#150;1892), daughter of Thomas Champion-de-Crespigny and widow of Thomas Henry Hastings Davies of Elmley Park, Worcester. On 3 July 1846, shortly after the fall of Robert Peel's ministry, he was created a baronet.<br>
<br>Pakington began his parliamentary career as a supporter of Peel, though he was never quite a consistent one. Although he voted with Peel on the second reading of the <span class="roman">Maynooth Bill</span> in April 1845, he voted against corn law repeal in 1846, and opposed reductions in sugar duties in 1848. &#145;All his liaisons are with Peel's party, whilst all his votes have been with yours&#146;, Disraeli was told  (Stewart, 138). Nevertheless, he did not become clearly identified with protectionist Conservatism until he joined Lord Derby's government in February 1852, as secretary of state for war and the colonies. He had expected only a minor post, but such was the paucity of administrative talent on the protectionist side that he was &#145;pitchforked into the vacant place&#146;. His appointment was the occasion of the duke of Wellington's famous remark, applicable to the ministry as a whole, &#145;Who is he? I never heard of him&#146;  (Vincent, 71&#150;2); he had no experience of office, and spoke only occasionally in parliamentary debates. Pakington himself thought the 1852 government &#145;not strong enough numerically to be quite comfortable and independent&#146;  (Pakington to Disraeli, 9 Aug 1852, MS Hughenden B/XX/P/6). He was also perhaps somewhat hostile to Disraeli personally.<br>
<br>Pakington's only major legislative act during the 1852 administration was successfully to carry through a bill, which he had inherited from his predecessor Sir George Grey, granting New Zealand a representative constitution. The <span class="roman">New Zealand Act</span> (1852) &#145;was not unjustifiably claimed to be the most liberal colonial measure since the American Revolution&#146;  (Morrell, <span class="italic">Policy in the mid-Victorian Age</span>, 338). Other concessions which he made to colonial reformers included granting the Australian colonies control of lands and land revenues, and an undertaking to abolish the transportation of convicts.<h2>
<a name="Educationalreform"></a>Educational reform</h2>It was in the following six years, when the Conservatives were in opposition, that Pakington developed the most distinctive side of his political identity with a very public espousal of radical reform of working-class education. This was not a completely new departure, for it drew on his long experience of county government. From 1834 to 1858 he was chairman of the Worcestershire quarter sessions, where he formed an interest in penal policy and the roots of crime. He was one of the Conservatives who campaigned against beerhouses, introducing a <span class="roman">Sale of Beer Act</span> in 1840. The link between ignorance and crime particularly impressed him. His <span class="roman">Juvenile Offenders Act</span> (1847) reflected a long-standing concern about young offenders, which led him to support Mary Carpenter and Matthew Davenport Hill in their proposals for industrial schools. He was a member of the Worcester diocesan board of education, and helped to found in 1852 the teacher training college at Saltley.<br>
<br>Although Pakington stressed the importance of religion in education, he took a less rigid denominational line than the leaders of the National Society, the body which ran most Anglican schools. He was the only member of Derby's cabinet in 1852 to voice disapproval of the proposed management clauses for elementary schools receiving government grants, on the decidedly unorthodox grounds (for a tory) that it would give too much power to the local clergy. In religious matters generally he was more liberal than the rest of his party, voting in favour of a bill (1857) to permit Jews to take their seats in parliament, and proposing (1858) a settlement of the contested issue of church rates by exempting dissenters from payment. He supported the work of the Church of England Education Society, founded in 1853 on a broader basis than the National Society, in that it did not restrict instruction to members of the established church, or require every pupil to be taught the catechism.<br>
<br>Pakington's knowledge of the state of elementary schooling convinced him that schools supported by rates were needed to supplement the existing schools run by the churches. James Prince Lee, the Birmingham headmaster and subsequently bishop of Manchester, was an important influence. In October 1853 Pakington was approached by Manchester educational reformers, led by Lee, and asked to take charge of their <span class="roman">Local Rating Bill</span> during the 1854 parliamentary session. Having consulted Lord Derby, Pakington refused, partly for political reasons and partly through doubts about some of the bill's religious provisions. But he made it clear that had time allowed he would have brought forward his own bill in 1854, and in 1855 he did so.<br>
<br>In January 1855 Pakington gave notice of a bill which foreshadowed many of the features of the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, and which was indeed in some respects more radical. He believed he could promote educational reform in an independent and private capacity while, if the bill were successful, political advantage could accrue to the Conservative Party. His proposal was to allow ratepayers to elect school committees which could both build new schools and aid existing ones. New schools would be free. Existing ones would be aided only if they granted all pupils a conscience clause (that is, a declaration allowing parents to withdraw their children from denominational religious instruction), and gave up any power to refuse attendance on religious grounds. Religious instruction would be Anglican unless a majority of inhabitants were dissenters, in which case the privy council would decide. Undoubtedly Pakington expected some support from his front bench colleagues, if not official endorsement. Instead Derby and Disraeli believed they had been placed in &#145;an inconvenient and embarrassing position&#146;  (Disraeli to Pakington, 5 Jan 1855, Hampton MSS, 3835/7). The bill threatened the unity of the Conservative front bench&#151;Lord Stanley, a crucial figure, supported it, though with reservations&#151;at a time when the leadership anticipated the disintegration of the Aberdeen government. They urged Pakington to abandon the bill.<br>
<br>Ignoring the pleas of Derby and Disraeli, Pakington introduced his bill on 16 March 1855. He depended on the Liberal government for parliamentary time, however, and Palmerston would only give him enough to keep the issue alive as an embarrassment for Derby, not to pass the bill. It was eventually abandoned in June. In the meantime Pakington had on 23 February 1855 been appointed to the committee of inquiry into the condition of the army before Sevastopol.<br>
<br>In 1857 Pakington introduced another, slightly less radical, education bill. This time he had the support even of the Cobdenite radicals, represented by the National Public School Association, who were willing to back a measure aimed at satisfying both moderate Anglicans and dissenters. In 1856 he delivered an address on national education to the members of the Manchester Athenaeum; it was one of his few publications. As in 1855 he unsuccessfully tried to get party support for his bill, and after resisting strenuous efforts by Derby and Disraeli, the party leaders, to &#145;stave off the measure&#146;  (Vincent, 149), he introduced his bill in February 1857. It was lost in the dissolution, however, and never got a second reading. Nevertheless his espousal of educational reform, acknowledged by his appointment as president of the education department at the first congress of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, held in 1857, was not without result. It was his resolution of 11 February 1858 which secured the appointment of the Newcastle royal commission on elementary education which he later referred to as &#145;my child&#146;  (Pakington to Disraeli, 10 April 1862, MS Hughenden B/XX/P/67).<h2>
<a name="FirstlordoftheAdmiralty"></a>First lord of the Admiralty</h2>In March 1858 Palmerston's government fell and Pakington became first lord of the Admiralty in Lord Derby's second administration, having turned down the Home Office. Like that of his colleagues, much of Pakington's energy was taken up with the parliamentary reform issue, which it was widely recognized would make or break the administration. That aside, perhaps his most significant act was the announcement in February 1859 that the navy was to build its first two iron-clad battleships, the <i>Warrior</i> and the <i>Black Prince</i>. Pakington was later president of the Institution of Naval Architects, and took part in establishing the Royal College of Naval Architecture. He left office on the government's fall in June 1859, and was created GCB.<br>
<br>In 1862 Pakington's involvement in educational reform resumed when he stepped into the controversy surrounding the Liberal government's revised education code, which was their response to the report of the Newcastle commission. He attempted to move resolutions widening the narrow political debate about the technicalities of the code to the principles upon which state support for education should be based. He particularly advocated giving power to local agencies&#151;the county and borough boards of education proposed by the royal commission&#151;as opposed to the centralizing authority of the committee of the privy council. But although he secured support from educationists such as Kay-Shuttleworth, and for once from other leading Conservatives such as Henley Walpole and Manners, Disraeli and Derby again acted to suppress the initiative.<br>
<br>In February 1865 Pakington did secure the appointment of a select committee, which he chaired, into the structure of the education department. His motion attracted the support of many tories hostile to the general approach of the department, with its strong emphasis on securing access for children of all denominations to state-aided schools. But the committee's approach disappointed these tories. Pakington was perceived to have packed the committee &#145;with his own friends to the prejudice of genuine Tory principles&#146;  (Lygon to Disraeli, 9 Feb 1866, MS Hughenden B/XX/L/43); and the committee's draft conclusions were liberal in tone and noticeably wider in scope than originally envisaged. However, before the committee finalized its report the Russell government fell, and while the committee's draft report was published, no final recommendations were made.<br>
<br>Embarrassment on the education issue having been duly avoided, in June 1866 Pakington was appointed first lord of the Admiralty for the second time, in Derby's third government. However, his second spell at the Admiralty was brief. In March 1867 resignations over the Conservative <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> forced Lord Derby to reshuffle his cabinet, and Pakington moved to the War Office. His speech on re-election at Droitwich (13 March 1867) was to become famous for revealing the hastily constructed nature of the cabinet's initial reform proposals, which as a consequence became known as the <span class="roman">Ten Minutes Bill</span>. Pakington left office for the last time following the Conservative defeat at the general election of 1868.<br>
<br>Pakington remained in the Commons throughout the 1868 parliament. He was generally supportive of the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, although he disliked the compromise Cowper-Temple clause which introduced broadly undenominational religious education in board schools. In the summer of 1871 he embarked on a brief flirtation with the new social movement&#151;an alliance of working-class leaders and aristocratic Conservatives designed by John Scott Russell, the naval architect with whom Pakington had a previous association, to find common ground on social issues. Pakington, Derby noted on 26 July 1871, was &#145;intoxicated with the prospect of being one of the regenerators of society, and reconciling the people with the aristocracy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 86). His address later that year as president of the Social Science Association congress at Leeds was similarly criticized for &#145;giving encouragement to wild theories&#146; of a socialist tendency  (ibid., 90&#150;1). In the general election of February 1874 he suffered the humiliation of losing his Droitwich seat to a Liberal, a result which may have come as a relief to the Conservative leadership. Disraeli related to the queen Pakington's self-deprecatory remark that &#145;Providence had disposed of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, ed. A. C. Benson and Lord Esher, and G. E. Buckle, 2nd ser., 1926&#150;8, 2.321).<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>On 6 March 1874 Pakington entered the Lords as Baron Hampton. In his first speech in the upper house he moved a resolution in favour of appointing a minister of education, something he had long favoured and for which he pressed strongly when in 1868 the Conservatives sought, unsuccessfully, to construct a passable <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>. In November 1875 he was appointed first civil service commissioner, with a salary of &pound;2000 a year, which he needed to alleviate his financial problems. But in view of his age the appointment was regarded as inappropriate in some quarters, and it was said to have contributed to the Conservative government's defeat on a vote on patronage in July 1877. Hampton died at his London home, 9 Eaton Square, on 9 April 1880. He was buried in the family mausoleum at Hampton-Lovett church, Worcestershire, on 15 April.<br>
<br>Pakington was described as being &#145;of the middle size, with a pale face, and rather a hooked nose&#146;. His dress and bearing gave &#145;indications of correctness and finish, rather than of greatness or genius&#146;  (J. E. Ritchie, <span class="italic">British Senators</span>, 1869, 40). Although never a serious candidate to lead his party&#151;and regarded by his colleagues as prone to muddled thinking&#151;Pakington was a front-bench political figure for almost twenty years. Known as a competent and an orthodox administrator when at the colonial, naval, and War offices&#151;and disapproving of Liberal policy in those areas&#151;he was in many respects representative of orthodox squirearchical Conservatism. However, he had a definite eccentric streak. A Peelite who nevertheless voted against corn law repeal, he was later attracted to the idea of fusion with Palmerstonian Liberalism. Above all he persistently promoted Liberal, indeed radical, educational reform. In retrospect that was the most distinctive aspect of his political identity.<br>
