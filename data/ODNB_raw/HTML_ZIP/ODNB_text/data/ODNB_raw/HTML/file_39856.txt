<span class="headword">Ross,  William</span>, Baron Ross of Marnock  (1911&#150;1988), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Ayr on 7 April 1911, the third of four children and only son of William Henry Ross, locomotive driver, of 7 Kirkholm Avenue, Ayr, who became senior bailie of Ayr town council. For the whole of his life his home was in Ayr, where his schooldays were at Ayr Academy. From there he went on to Glasgow University on a Carnegie scholarship and graduated MA in 1932. He then became a primary schoolteacher in Glasgow. The general strike of 1926, when his father was unemployed, and the depression of the 1930s intensified the political ideas he imbibed from his parents.<br>
<br>In 1936 Ross was selected as Labour candidate for Ayr constituency. He continued teaching until 1940, when he enlisted in the Highland light infantry, training in the Shetlands and Wales. He served in the north-west frontier of India until seconded to signals general headquarters India in Delhi. In 1944 he became cipher officer to Lord Louis Mountbatten, supreme commander, south-east Asia, in Ceylon and accompanied him on flights to Burma and Singapore for the signing of the peace treaty with the Japanese. He was appointed MBE (military) in 1945 and demobilized in the rank of major.<br>
<br>At the 1945 election Ross unsuccessfully contested the Ayr burghs constituency, but at a by-election in 1946 he was elected Labour member for Kilmarnock, Ayr, and Bute, which he continued to represent until he retired in 1979. His first government appointment was as parliamentary private secretary to Hector McNeil, secretary of state for Scotland, a post he held until the defeat of the Labour government in 1951. From the back benches he worked as an aide to Douglas Houghton on pensions, insurance, and health. In 1962 he became shadow secretary of state for Scotland, and his energies were directed to changing public policy and narrowing the gap between the Scottish economy and that of the south of England.<br>
<br>In 1964 Ross became secretary of state for Scotland, the office he most desired. Carrying as it did responsibility for functions which in England are exercised by ministers for the Home department, education, health, agriculture, electricity, and local government, it gave great scope to his boundless energy and gave him the opportunity to put into practice the policies for which he had fought with such zeal in opposition. Openly at Westminster and in Scotland, but also behind the scenes, he campaigned vigorously to achieve his aim of shifting industry from the south to Scotland and, under the auspices of the Scottish development department, he had much success in this. His creation of the Highlands and Islands Development Board changed for the better many aspects of life and work in the highlands. He gave full support to the activities of the Scottish new towns, which were particularly successful in attracting new enterprises both from England and the USA. Relinquishing his position at the fall of the Labour government in 1970, Ross resumed as secretary of state for Scotland in the following Labour government elected in 1974. However, when Harold Wilson resigned in 1976, Ross lost the Scottish Office because he was not in favour of devolution, which was then in vogue. He accepted a life barony in 1979.<br>
<br>In 1978&#150;80 Ross was lord high commissioner to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, an appointment for which his strong religious beliefs and lifelong membership of the church made him highly suitable. He was fiercely loyal to everything he loved and believed in&#151;family, friends, the Labour Party, the church, and Scotland. He was of medium height, with light red hair, strong features, cleft chin, and piercing grey eyes. He was unsympathetic to the ideals of the &#145;permissive society&#146;. He was passionately fond of the works of Robert Burns, of which he had an extensive knowledge. His rich Ayrshire voice made him a welcome speaker at numerous Burns suppers, where his proposal of the &#145;immortal memory&#146; was unforgettable. In his speeches, both in parliament and elsewhere, he made some of his most telling points by an apt quotation from Burns. His main leisure interest was watching association football, and he was very proud when the Scottish Football Association made him honorary president in 1978.<br>
<br>Ross became an honorary LLD of the universities of St Andrews (1967), Strathclyde (1969), and Glasgow (1978), and a fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland (1971). In 1948 he married Elizabeth Jane Elma, daughter of John Aitkenhead, marine engineer and hotel owner. They had two daughters. Ross had a happy marriage and family life, and was a kind and loving husband and father. He died at home at 10 Chapelpark Road, Ayr, of cancer, on 10 June 1988.<br>
