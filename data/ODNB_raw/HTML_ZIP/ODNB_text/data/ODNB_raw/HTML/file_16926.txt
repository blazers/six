<span class="headword">Loe,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, may have been born in Kent. He graduated BA from St Alban Hall, Oxford, on 5 November 1597 and proceeded MA on 14 June 1600, at which time, Anthony Wood records, he &#145;was much in esteem for Latin, Greek and human learning&#146;. On 8 June 1618 Loe graduated BD from Merton College, and he was awarded his DD on 8 July. In 1598 he was presented to the vicarage of Churcham, Gloucestershire, and in 1600 was appointed master of the college school in Gloucester. It may be that about this time Loe married, but nothing is known of his wife.<br>
<br>On 3 September 1602 Loe was presented by the queen to a prebend of Gloucester in succession to Samuel Proctor; he was installed on 30 September 1602. It was as the holder of this dignity that he preached <span class="italic">The Joy of Jerusalem</span>, a sermon at Paul's Cross on 18 June 1609. On 26 November 1611 he was presented to the rectory of Stoke Severn, Worcestershire, and in 1614 published four sermons preached in Gloucester Cathedral. However, this smooth progress did not continue for long. In 1617 William Laud, newly appointed dean of Gloucester, ordered the removal of the communion table in the cathedral to the high altar; there was strong opposition, and a protest or &#145;libel&#146; was issued against Laud in which Loe appears to have been implicated. Perhaps it was this which helped earn the enmity of an unnamed powerful public man, later complained of. Yet Loe's reputation still stood high. Appointed chaplain to James I, he delivered a series of seven sermons at St Michael Cornhill and in the published version dedicated to the king was bold enough to suggest the need for moderate reform of &#145;the apparent errors and abuses crept into the church&#146;  (W. Loe, <span class="italic">The Mysterie of Mankind</span>, 1619, preface).<br>
<br>In 1618 Loe was appointed pastor of the English company of Merchant Adventurers at Hamburg, though his departure was delayed for almost a year. Yet the procedure was, on his own account, given in <span class="italic">The Merchant Reall</span>, a sermon published at Hamburg in 1620:<blockquote>both civil and honest. First by free election of your own fellowship. Secondly by approbation of the state whence I came. Thirdly by recommendation of his sacred majesty under his own hand, who pleased to grace me his unworthy servant with his royal letters, and of the most reverend archbishop of Canterbury &hellip; Fourthly with attestation from the famous university of Oxford, under their seal, and from the cathedral church.</blockquote>Armed with such impressive credentials, Loe did not hesitate to give advice on matters of a political nature. He warned his audience to ensure the orthodoxy of their apprentices: &#145;Their hearts are alienated, so are their actions, their intendments, their purposes. Unite them once in religion, they are yours absolute, present or absent; sleeping or waking, by sea or land&#146;; most unusually, he did not disown the label puritan but sought to distinguish between &#145;puritans in action &hellip; to whom all things are pure, altogether busy in honest action&#146; and &#145;puritans in faction&#146;, that is, &#145;all papists, anabaptists, brownists, separatists, and all singularists whatsoever&#146;  (Loe, <span class="italic">Merchant Reall</span>, 1&#150;2).<br>
<br>Loe remained in Hamburg almost a year, until at least 24 January 1620, when <span class="italic">Songs of Sion, Set for the Joy of God's Deere Ones</span> was signed &#145;from my study within the English house at Hamborough&#146;. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_16926"></a><span class="headword">William Loe</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1679), may have followed him in acting as a <span class="occ">preacher</span> to the Merchant Adventurers, issuing from Trinity College, Cambridge (from where he graduated in 1626 and of which he was a fellow), on 30 October 1627 <span class="italic">The Merchants Manuell</span> (1628), dedicated to the governor and members of the company. Loe records that the young William, having proceeded MA in 1629 and BD in 1636, was in Paris about 1638, where he was involved in discussions with leading Jesuits; he became vicar of Kirkby Masham, Yorkshire, in 1639.<br>
<br>Shortly after his own return to England, Loe senior issued his <span class="italic">Vox Clamantis: a Still Voice to the Three Thrice Honourable Estates of Parliament</span>, entered in the Stationers' register on 12 March 1621. In his epistle dedicated to George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, the author claimed that this work had &#145;lain suppressed some years, by means of a certain great one&#146;, recalling the &#145;aspersions of faction and sedition &hellip; which it pleased that great one mentioned to cast upon me at that time in an honourable assembly&#146;. Loe also hinted darkly that this opponent would have had him put him to death:<blockquote>if some reverend fathers of the church, the blessed beau-peers of divinity, had not stayed that enraged fury against me: but not long after, the hand of almighty God surprised that greatness, clipped it, restrained it, that it might doe no more harm, and so it remains to this day.</blockquote>Loe survived and prospered&#151;he was again a chaplain to the king by 9 October 1622, when he preached at Theobalds <span class="italic">The Kings Shoe</span> (1623)&#151;but he continued to take risks. In January 1623, in <span class="italic">The Kings Sword</span>&#151;a sermon before James and Prince Charles, newly returned from his abortive expedition to Spain&#151;Loe was careful to deny presuming to advise the king, but did actually urge him to the defence of the true religion by the sword, counselling military support for the Palatinate.<br>
<br>It was perhaps about this time that Loe was instituted to the vicarage of Putney, where he caused to have the entries from earlier registers of the parish copied into a new register, according to his statement on its flyleaf dated 17 January 1624 and signed &#145;William Leo, DD&#146;  (Bannerman, iii). He is also known to have been vicar of Wandsworth in 1631: a story is told of him that in a &#145;parish near London&#146;&#151;perhaps Wandsworth&#151;at morning service, in the absence of a colleague named Adams, he preached on the text &#145;Adam, where art thou?&#146; to which the missing cleric responded in the afternoon with an exposition of the words &#145;Lo, here am I!&#146;  (Chester, 140). In 1632 he published <span class="italic">The Incomparable Jewell</span>, a marriage sermon celebrating the virtuous wife. Loe is last heard of in connection with the death in April 1645 of the controversial figure Daniel Featley, whom he attended in his last sickness, and at whose funeral on 21 April he gave the oration, published later that year. Loe himself also died that year and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 21 September 1645.<br>
