<span class="headword">Carr,  Ralph</span>  (1711&#150;1806), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born on 22 September 1711, the eldest son of John Carr (1667&#150;1739), of Whickham and Newcastle upon Tyne, and his wife, Sarah (1679&#150;1733), daughter of William Wynne of Newcastle. Carr was apprenticed to a Newcastle merchant at the age of seventeen, serving out the last year of his time with one of his master's correspondents in Amsterdam, an experience which proved advantageous when he returned to Newcastle in 1738 to set up in business on his own account. He soon built up an extensive network of correspondents in coastal ports throughout Europe, dealing principally in grain, but gradually extending his interests to a wide range of other goods, from grindstones to groceries, and usually trading on his own behalf, but sometimes acting as shipping agent for other merchants. Trading networks of this kind depended on a complicated subsidiary trade in bills of exchange, and within a few years he had become convinced that opening a bank in Newcastle to handle this business would yield a handsome profit, a conviction that was strengthened during the 1745 rebellion when he became involved in transmitting funds as well as provisions to the army in Scotland. However, Carr was a deeply cautious man, unwilling to take even moderate risks, an attitude that prevented him from developing his potentially lucrative contacts with merchants in Boston and New York. The banking project therefore hung fire until 1755, when he entered into a partnership with three other Newcastle merchants, each of whom contributed &pound;500 to the initial capital of the enterprise that became known as the Old Bank. The venture, which Carr described as his &#145;hobby horse&#146;, yielded its founder a handsome profit, not least because he channelled his own business through the bank free of charge. In 1786 he used some of the proceeds to purchase an estate at Hedgeley in Northumberland and shortly afterwards retired from active trade.<br>
<br>Like his father before him, Carr had prudently delayed marriage until he was well established in the world, and it was not until 29 November 1758 that he married Isabella (1727&#150;1797), the daughter of Henry Byne, vicar of Ponteland, Northumberland. They had six children. He died on 7 May 1806 and was buried at Ponteland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, John Carr (1764&#150;1817), who in 1802 had married the granddaughter and eventual heiress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48032/', "William Cotesworth (c.1668&#150;1726)")</script> of Gateshead.<br>
