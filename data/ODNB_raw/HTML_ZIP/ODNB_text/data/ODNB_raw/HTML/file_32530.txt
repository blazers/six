<span class="headword">Connard,  Philip</span>  (1875&#150;1958), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Southport, Lancashire, on 24 March 1875, the son of David Connard, house painter, and his wife, Ellen Lunt. After elementary school he was briefly apprenticed to his father, but, having wider ambitions, he attended evening classes and eventually won a national school scholarship in textile designing which took him to the National Art Training School, South Kensington, in 1896. With a prize of &pound;100 from the British Institute he went next to Paris where he spent a few months studying under Jean-Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant. On his return to London he found small jobs as an illustrator and soon afterwards became a master at the Lambeth School of Art.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Connard had begun to submit work to open exhibitions. His d&eacute;but at the New English Art Club caught the attention of Henry Tonks and P. Wilson Steer who proposed him for membership in 1909. He staged his first solo exhibition at the Baillie Gallery, London, in 1904 and this was generally praised. That year he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of Archdeacon Collyer, with whom he had two daughters. A further solo exhibition of Connard's work was held at the Leicester Galleries, London. His next line of work was portraiture, and he joined the National Portrait Society. His portraits, though sound, were not especially distinguished; until the thirties his chief reputation derived from Romantic and decorative landscapes in oils. Throughout this period Connard's work was compared with that of his mentors. Marion Hepworth Dixon observed for instance that in decorative pictures of picnics and masquerades Connard adopted costumes of the mid-Victorian era, &#145;like many of his Chelsea brethren&#146;  (Dixon, 276). In these stylized compositions, harlequins, pierrettes, and exotic birds appear, the last being derived from careful sketches which he produced at London Zoo. Important decorative commissions included murals in the royal doll's house room at Windsor Castle. He painted two panels for the main ballroom at Delhi, and for the liner <i>Queen Mary</i> he executed a decorative panel 26 feet by 14 feet on the subject of England. Examples of his work were acquired by many public galleries including the Tate Gallery, London, and the Luxembourg Gallery, Paris.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Connard served in the Royal Field Artillery as a captain, but was invalided out after the battle of the Somme in 1916 and at the end of the war became an official artist to the Royal Navy. There are more than forty of his works in the Imperial War Museum.<br>
<br>Between the wars Connard developed new strands in his work, painting a series of monumental river scenes with semi-classical nude bathers of which <span class="italic">Summer</span> (1922; Tate collection) was purchased under the terms of the Chantrey Bequest. A further example of this type, <span class="italic">Apollo and Daphne</span> (RA), was accepted as his diploma picture in 1925 when he was elected Royal Academician. Jessica Walker Stephens, referring to his work at this time, described Connard's attempt to revive the era of Watteau as a &#145;forceful aesthetic&#146;  (Stephens, 308).<br>
<br>Painting expeditions with Steer encouraged Connard to take up watercolour and he was elected to the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1934. Though perhaps more highly appreciated in his lifetime than now, his watercolours form an elegant and lyrical contribution to the English watercolour tradition. By this time he had purchased Cholmondeley Lodge, overlooking the Thames at Richmond, Surrey, and there he painted many riverside scenes which were unlike his earlier works, being far more realistic in style. His evocative landscape <span class="italic">Winter at Richmond</span> (Tate collection) was the subject of another Chantrey purchase in 1939. He became keeper of the Royal Academy Schools in 1945, a post he held until 1949, and he was made CVO in 1950. In 1933 he had married secondly Georgina York, of Twickenham, who figured in many of his later interior paintings.<br>
<br>Connard was a man of equable and pleasant disposition though on certain issues his friends were apt to find him obstinate and pig-headed. He was a faithful member of the New English Arts Club, where he often met friends such as Sir William Orpen and F. Derwent Wood. An excellent raconteur, he could set the table in a roar with his Lancashire stories.<br>
<br>Connard continued to paint silvery grey landscapes of the river at Richmond up until his death at the Nightingale Nursing Home, Twickenham, on 8 December 1958.<br>
