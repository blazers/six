<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Allingham,  Margery Louise</span>  (1904&#150;1966), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 20 May 1904 in Ealing, London. She was the eldest of three children of the journalist and writer Herbert John Allingham (1867&#150;1936), editor of the <span class="italic">London Journal</span>, and his wife, Emily Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hughes (1879&#150;1960). Both parents, who were cousins, produced pulp fiction for serialization in popular magazines and journals. Margery's literary apprenticeship began on her seventh birthday, when she was assigned her own office in the family home at the Old Rectory in Layer Breton, Essex. While her beloved father's encouragement probably influenced Allingham's writerly development most significantly, her conventional education was not neglected, despite an illness which kept her from school for some years. She attended Endsleigh House School in Colchester from 1915 to 1918, then moved to the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge from 1919 to 1920, and completed her education at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London (1921&#150;23), where she studied speech and drama and lost her childhood stammer.<br>
<br>Although her hope for a career in the theatre was disappointed, Allingham was already launched in what would be her lifelong professions of journalism and writing fiction. By 1922 she had published reviews, stories, and film synopses in the <span class="italic">Picture Show</span> and the <span class="italic">Girl's Cinema</span>, fan magazines edited by her maternal aunt, Maud Hughes, the first of their kind in Britain. Her first novel, <span class="italic">Blackkerchief Dick</span>, an adventure story, appeared in 1923. She met her future husband, Philip (Pip) Youngman Carter (1904&#150;1969), an art student at the polytechnic, in 1921. The couple married on 29 September 1927. Their amiable, childless marriage was funded by Allingham's increasingly successful fiction. And, although Youngman Carter assisted his wife as a sounding board for plot design, and by producing covers and illustrations for her work, he found it difficult to sell his art. Allingham supported his increasingly expensive tastes until after the Second World War, when Pip came into his own writing society columns for <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, which he edited from 1954.<br>
<br>While the couple retained a base in London, from 1931 their main home was in rural Essex, a region with which Allingham always felt a deep affinity. In 1937 they took up permanent residence at D'Arcy House at Tolleshunt D'Arcy just 5 miles from Allingham's childhood home at Layer Breton. Aside from her affection for her garden, and her first aid and air raid precautions work during the Second World War, Allingham's was a writer's life. During her long career she published twenty-five novels, as well as the posthumous <span class="italic">Cargo of Eagles</span> (1968), completed by her husband. In addition she produced four novellas, sixty-four stories, a wartime book on England for American readers, and a great number of reviews and other articles for such publications as <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, and <span class="italic">Homes and Gardens</span>.<br>
<br>Despite her sunny character, and her success as a novelist, the last part of Allingham's life also contained difficulties and disappointments. The thyroid condition from which she had suffered since her polytechnic days, and which was the reason for her corpulence, was finally diagnosed in 1940. By the 1950s she was increasingly ill, and her condition led to episodes of confusion and depression, for which she was hospitalized. Discovery of Pip's infidelity, and problems with the Inland Revenue caused her distress for many years. In the end, she suffered from breast cancer, and died at Severalls Hospital, Colchester, on 30 June 1966. She was buried at Tolleshunt D'Arcy five days later, in the graveyard of the fourteenth-century church of St Nicholas, and remembered for her warmth, vitality, and humour.<br>
<br>The significance of Allingham's contribution to the development of detective fiction becomes clearer as time passes. She is rightly judged to be one of the four queens of crime of the golden age of mystery writing along with Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Ngaio Marsh. Her contribution to the genre is the foregrounding of the kinds of psychological interest which would lead later in the twentieth century to the psychological crime fiction of such exemplary practitioners as Ruth Rendell, P. D. James, and Minette Walters. Allingham's fiction displays a keen sense of place, and in this comparisons are often made between her work and that of Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson. Her representation of houses and architecture is deft and resonant. She also shares a particular sense of fun and gaiety with P. G. Wodehouse, who is sometimes mentioned in discussions of her dialogue, with its breezy and often zany 1920s English taste for eccentricity, wit, and absurdity. Most of all, however, she is praised for her set of memorable recurring characters, who grow in depth as her career proceeds. The most important of these, her detective Albert Campion, made his first appearance in <span class="italic">The Crime at Black Dudley</span> (1929), her second mystery novel after her d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">The White Cottage Mystery</span> (1928). The diffident, languid, aristocratic Campion, with his sensitivity to evil and his passion for justice, becomes an increasingly complex figure over time. Campion's comic manservant, Magersfontein Lugg, an earthy former burglar, and Campion's associate, the earnest policeman Stanislaus Oates, both first appear in <span class="italic">Mystery Mile</span> (1930). Lady Amanda Fitton, who later marries Campion and who is one of Allingham's characteristically strong female characters, is introduced in <span class="italic">Sweet Danger</span> (1933) as a young woman who combines high spirits with high intelligence and, most unusually, electrical and engineering skills. Another interesting young policeman, Charlie Luke, appears in <span class="italic">More Work for the Undertaker</span> (1948). Allingham deploys her ensemble of characters to make intricate observations regarding political, class, gender, and family relations, as well as using them in more conventional ways in the service of her always entertaining mysteries.<br>
<br>Opinion differs as to Allingham's best book, though there is general consensus that her finest fiction appeared after the Second World War. Her own favourite was <span class="italic">The Beckoning Lady</span> (1955), which contained autobiographical elements. <span class="italic">More Work for the Undertaker</span>, featuring one of Allingham's absorbing eccentric fictional families, is also well regarded. However, it is <span class="italic">The Tiger in the Smoke</span> (1952), which has attracted the most critical esteem, with its killer on the loose in fog-bound London, its surreal touches, and its intense drama of good and evil.<br>
<br>Allingham's work has been adapted for audio cassette, radio, and television. The BBC television series based on her novels in 1989 and 1990 was particularly successful and brought her many new readers.<br>
