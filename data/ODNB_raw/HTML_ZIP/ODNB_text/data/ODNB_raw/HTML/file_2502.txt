<span class="headword">Blackadder,  John</span>  (1615/1623?&#150;1686), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was perhaps born in December 1615 or in 1623, the son of John Blackadder of Inzievar, of the families of Blackadder of Blairhall and Tulliallan, and his wife, Helen, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22507/', "Robert Pont (1524&#150;1606)")</script>, minister of St Cuthbert, near Edinburgh. In 1640 or 1646 he married Janet (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter of Homer Haining, merchant of Dumfries. He was a distinguished student at the University of Glasgow, where his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26632/', "John Strang (1583/4&#150;1654)")</script> was principal, and from where he graduated MA in 1650. Unanimously called to the parish of Troqueer, near Dumfries, in 1652, he was ordained on 7 June 1653. Blackadder is said to have worked hard to restore church discipline and reform his flock during this turbulent period. However, following the restoration of episcopacy in 1662, he was deprived of his charge and temporarily imprisoned in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Blackadder then retired with his wife and family to Glencairn, Dumfriesshire, and other places. As one of the deprived ministers who believed that the civil government could not revoke their right to preach, he strove to maintain presbyterianism by preaching at conventicles together with other respected preachers, such as John Welsh, Alexander Peden, and Donald Cargill. The records of the privy council show that letters for his apprehension were issued four times between 1666 and 1677, but Blackadder remained at large. On one occasion, when he delivered a sermon at Kinkell, near St Andrews, the people crowded to hear him, notwithstanding the absolute commands of Archbishop James Sharp (himself a former presbyterian). When the irate archbishop ordered the provost to march out the militia to disperse the congregation, he was told it was impossible, as the militia had gone there as worshippers.<br>
<br>Outlawed, and with a reward offered for his body, in 1678 Blackadder fled to Rotterdam, where he apparently helped to heal differences between the presbyterian incumbents of the Scottish kirk, the moderate Robert Fleming and the more extreme Robert McWard. He was back in Edinburgh in June 1679, though he seems to have returned briefly to the Netherlands, where in 1680 his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2504/', "William Blackadder (1647&#150;1696)")</script>, enrolled at the University of Leiden. On 5 April 1681 he was seized in Edinburgh, examined before the privy council, and sent to the Bass Rock. After four years of rigid imprisonment his health finally gave way. In December 1685 the privy council gave permission for him to leave, on condition of his confining himself to Edinburgh, but it was too late, and he died on the Bass in January 1686. He was buried in the churchyard at North Berwick, where a dedicatory tombstone was erected in the nineteenth century. He was survived by his wife, who died on 9 November 1688 and was buried the next day at Greyfriars, Edinburgh, and by at least four of his five sons and two daughters: William, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2501/', "Adam Blackadder (b. 1659, d. in or after 1696)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2503/', "John Blackadder (1664&#150;1729)")</script>, and Elizabeth, who in 1687 married James Young, writer, of Edinburgh.<br>
