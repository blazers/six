<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Worlock,  Derek John Harford</span>  (1920&#150;1996), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Liverpool</span>, was born at 7F Grove End Road, St John's Wood, London, on 4 February 1920, the second of three children of Captain Harford Worlock (1883&#150;1956), journalist, civil servant, and Conservative Party agent, and his wife, Dora Dennis Hoblyn (1881&#150;1953), daughter of Charles Dennis Hoblyn, of Newlyn, Cornwall, a London stockbroker. His paternal grandfather was Thomas Worlock, civil servant; his mother was an organizer for the women's suffrage movement. His parents both became Catholics in July 1913, prior to their marriage in 1914. He was baptized on 12 February 1920, with his twin sister, in the family house, the ceremony being registered at Our Lady's Catholic Church, St John's Wood, on 27 March. He first attended Priory House preparatory school in Swiss Cottage (1926) and then Oakland House preparatory school in Blackheath (1927). In 1929 the family moved to Winchester, as his father, who had fought at the battle of the Somme, became Conservative Party agent for that constituency. There he attended Winton House School until 1934, when he was accepted in Douglass House, at St Edmund's College, Ware, Hertfordshire, as a junior candidate for the priesthood for the diocese of Westminster. From an early age he had shown determination to be a Catholic priest and in this was encouraged by his parents. After studies of philosophy and theology he was ordained to the priesthood in Westminster Cathedral by Archbishop Bernard William Griffin on 3 June 1944, three days before D-day. During his student days he was captain of Douglass House and of the college rugby team, the writer and producer of plays, senior warden responsible for air-raid and fire precautions, and an industrious student. At one point his ordination was in question because of ill health, which also prevented him from pursuing further studies at Cambridge University.<h2>
<a name="EarlyministryandVaticanII"></a>Early ministry and Vatican II</h2>After ordination Worlock's first appointment, in July 1944, was as a curate in the parish of Our Lady of Victories, Kensington, where he was engaged in ministering to victims of the war bombing. In July 1945 he was appointed under-secretary to Archbishop Griffin and thereby involved in much contact and negotiation with the newly formed Labour government, especially in matters of health, welfare, and education. In 1947 he became first secretary to Cardinal Griffin and, in August 1949, was made a monsignor at the age of twenty-nine. He accompanied Cardinal Griffin on trips to Europe, Canada, and the United States, which were aimed at the social and spiritual rebuilding taking place in the post-war period. From the early 1950s he had virtual responsibility for the administration of the diocese, because of Griffin's ill health. After the death of Cardinal Griffin on 20 August 1956, Worlock became secretary to the new archbishop, William Godfrey, in December 1956. As a former papal diplomat, Godfrey enjoyed good contacts in the Holy See, and personal friendship with Pope John XXIII. When in 1958 the pope announced the holding of the Second Vatican Council, Cardinal Godfrey was made a member of the central preparatory commission. For Worlock this meant numerous journeys to Rome, in support of the cardinal, who at that time was recovering from a cancer operation. By the time of the opening of the Second Vatican Council in October 1962, Worlock was well known in Rome and given advisory and administrative tasks in support of the bishops from England and Wales attending the council.<br>
<br>On 20 January 1963 Cardinal Godfrey died. John Carmel Heenan was appointed to succeed him that September. During the second session of the council, in the autumn of 1963, Worlock continued his work as an adviser (or <i>peritus</i>), but on his return to London his nineteen years' work in Archbishop's House, Westminster, came to an end. In March 1964 he was appointed parish priest of St Mary and St Michael, Commercial Road, east London. There he combined pastoral duties and innovations with his continuing involvement in the work of the council. He attended the third and fourth sessions of the council during the autumns of 1964 and 1965, helping to draft sections of the council documents, particularly the decree on the apostolate of the laity (<span class="italic">Apostolicam actuositatem</span>) and the pastoral constitution on the church in the world of today (<span class="italic">Gaudium et spes</span>). At this time he first made the acquaintance of many leading bishops and theologians from around the world, including Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II. He also kept frank and detailed diaries of the events of the Second Vatican Council. In 1965 he published <span class="italic">English Bishops at the Council</span>, an uncontroversial account of aspects of the work of the council.<h2>
<a name="BishopofPortsmouth"></a>Bishop of Portsmouth</h2>In the course of the final session of the Second Vatican Council, on 18 October 1965, Worlock was appointed sixth bishop of Portsmouth, at the age of forty-five. With the ending of the council on 7 December, he was able to return to England and take up these new duties, with episcopal ordination on 21 December. During his ten years as bishop of Portsmouth, he worked endlessly to implement the conclusions of the council in all aspects of the life of the church, its liturgy, education, social mission, in relation to other Christian churches, and in relation to public and political life. Some of his thoughts about this reform were expressed in a book, <span class="italic">Give Me Your Hand</span> (1977). During this time he was appointed episcopal secretary of the bishops' conference of England and Wales. As president of the laity council for England and Wales, and as a member of the pontifical council for the laity, he promoted the responsibilities and roles of the Catholic laity. He also became a regular member of the international synod of bishops, a body newly established by the council, which met every few years. He was elected to this task by the bishops' conference of England and Wales.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofLiverpool"></a>Archbishop of Liverpool</h2>On 7 February 1976 Worlock was appointed to succeed Archbishop George Andrew Beck as the tenth archbishop of Liverpool, at the same time as Abbot Hume of Ampleforth was appointed archbishop of Westminster. Derek Worlock took up his new appointment on 16 March, and thus became responsible for one of the largest Catholic dioceses. He was, shortly afterwards, elected vice-president of the bishops' conference which led to the enduring and fruitful partnership between himself and Cardinal Hume. Although different in temperament and talent, with Hume intuitive and charismatic, and Worlock methodical and far-sighted, this partnership gave particular character to Catholic life in England for twenty years.<br>
<br>Worlock's arrival in Liverpool also established the partnership he enjoyed with Bishop David Sheppard, the Anglican bishop of Liverpool. Throughout the next twenty years they worked closely together on all major issues of concern to the city and their church communities. Often in partnership with the leader of the free churches, they gave a new profile to the Christian presence and gospel in the north-west of England. Together they published two books about their ministry in Liverpool: <span class="italic">Better Together</span> (1988) and <span class="italic">With Christ in the Wilderness</span> (1990). Together they were able to welcome Elizabeth II on her silver jubilee visit to Liverpool in the summer of 1977, including her attendance at services in both the Anglican and Catholic cathedrals.<br>
<br>In 1979 Worlock went to Latin America in order to visit some of his priests who were working there. On his return he established the Liverpool archdiocesan missionary project (LAMP) which ensured that the resources of the archdiocese were shared with the poorest parts of the church in Latin America. His skills as a diplomat and organizer were crucial in two major Catholic initiatives at that time. In 1980 the national pastoral congress was held in Liverpool. This major gathering undertook a review of Catholic life and put forward recommendations for the future. Worlock was essential in its planning, execution, and follow-up. He also played a central role in the visit of Pope John Paul II to Britain in May 1982, the first ever visit a pope had made to Britain. With the outbreak of the conflict in the Falklands, the visit came under threat of cancellation, but Worlock played a crucial role in ensuring that it went ahead. The visit of the pope to Liverpool was remembered as a turning point in relationships between the churches in these islands.<br>
<br>In response to the Toxteth riots of 1981, Worlock became more directly involved in the public life of Liverpool. He took significant steps, at some personal risk, to foster better relationships between the local community and the police, and worked hard for the establishment of the Liverpool 8 law centre. During these years, the well-established church leaders group was involved in a number of important industrial disputes in and around Merseyside, always with the intention of effecting reconciliation between conflicting parties. Worlock and Sheppard were also members of the Merseyside enterprise forum, and, after the successful international garden festival held in Liverpool in 1984, they took the initiative of establishing the Michaelmas group, a forum for up to twenty leaders of industry and enterprise at which ways of revitalizing the city could be explored. At this time Liverpool politics were dominated by the Militant Tendency group, and all Worlock's political skill was required in his attempts, with Sheppard, to foster understanding between the city and central government. In the autumn of 1984 he also took steps to see if there was any scope for further discussion when the national miners' strike had become deadlocked. Although his efforts were not successful, and open to misinterpretation, they were typical of his determination to apply his vision of Christian reconciliation to the most complex of social problems. He also took particular interest in housing issues, sustaining detailed and challenging dialogue with successive government ministers.<br>
<br>In May 1985 a major disturbance at the Heysel football stadium in Brussels before a match between Liverpool and Juventus caused the death and injury of many people from Turin. Worlock and Sheppard took a major role not only in bringing consolation to many but also in attempting to repair the damaged relationships. They went to Turin with a delegation of Liverpool city councillors, and Worlock celebrated a mass of reconciliation in the cathedral of Turin. A further tragedy occurred on 15 April 1989 at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, in which ninety-six Liverpool supporters died. At the mass held the following evening in the Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, attended by almost 8000 people, Worlock exercised a unique ministry to a city in a moment of shock and horror.<br>
<br>Throughout the period after the Second Vatican Council, Worlock also sought to promote better understanding and greater visible unity between the Christian churches, through his tireless work for the establishment of the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland. The inaugural ceremonies for that new council took place in the two cathedrals of Liverpool in 1989. Earlier, he had worked with the six Merseyside church leaders to establish a covenant to unity, entitled &#145;Called to partnership&#146;, signed on 26 May 1985 in the Anglican cathedral. Growing out of this, the Merseyside and region churches ecumenical assembly (MARCEA) was established as a forum for ensuring Christian partnership wherever possible. From 1973 until 1994 he attended the annual meetings of the national conference of priests of England and Wales. Appointed to this task by his fellow bishops shortly after its establishment, he guided and defended the conference through many difficulties. In this he demonstrated characteristic dedication and loyalty to the priests, courage and astuteness in the advice he gave, and willingness to see through a task once undertaken.<br>
<br>In July 1992 Worlock was first diagnosed as suffering from cancer. Intensive treatment gave him sufficient remission to continue a public ministry. In January 1995 he and Sheppard were made freemen of the city of Liverpool, a rare honour. In July 1995 he undertook his last public engagement: characteristically the ordination of a young man to the priesthood. In the new year's honours list of 1996 he was made a Companion of Honour, but was unable to travel to receive the award. He died at Lourdes Hospital, Mossley Hill, Liverpool, on 8 February 1996, and was buried in the Metropolitan Cathedral, Liverpool, on 15 February 1996.<br>
