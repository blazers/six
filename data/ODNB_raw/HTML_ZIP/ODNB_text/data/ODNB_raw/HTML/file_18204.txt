<span class="headword">Martin,  Peter John</span>  (1786&#150;1860), <span class="occ">doctor and geologist</span>, was born on 26 March 1786 in Pulborough, Sussex, the son of Peter Patrick Martin (1750&#150;1840) of Edinburgh, who had set up in medical practice in Pulborough in 1774 and married Mary Backshell in 1778. The second-born in a family of nine children, Martin had five sisters and three brothers. Thomas (1779&#150;1867), the eldest son, together with his father, were largely responsible for Peter Martin's early education. When Thomas entered medical practice in Reigate, Surrey, Martin moved with him, prior to taking up his own studies in medicine at the united hospitals of Guy's and St Thomas's in London and later, from 1805 to 1807, at the University of Edinburgh medical school. After completing his studies (MRCS 1813) Martin joined his father in practice in Pulborough, where he married his cousin, Mary Watson of Dunbar, in 1821. A family of four daughters and one son were born between 1822 and 1831; the son, Robert (1827&#150;1891), became a physician at St Bartholomew's.<br>
<br>Martin was reputed to have gained his interest in geology during his residency in Edinburgh, where he became partial to the &#145;Huttonian theory&#146;. In any event, once he had joined his father in practice, he began to study the land around his native Pulborough. Between 1829 and 1857 he contributed several papers to the Geological Society of London (of which he was elected a fellow in 1833) and to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>. His most important publication was, however, produced privately in 1828&#151;<span class="italic">A geological memoir on a part of western Sussex with some observations upon chalk-basins, the Weald-denudation and outliers-by-protrusion</span>. This thin quarto volume brought Martin into a county already investigated by other eminent geologists, including William Henry Fitton (whom Martin acknowledged in his preface) and in particular Gideon Mantell (1790&#150;1852), the &#145;wizard of the Weald&#146; and discoverer of the dinosaur <i>Iguanodon</i>. It was a thinly disguised &#145;attack&#146;  (Martin to John Hawkins, 26 May 1828, London, Geological Society Archives) on Mantell in Martin's book which attracted some attention from contemporaries such as the Wernerian John Hawkins (1761?&#150;1841), who regarded Martin as &#145;a sort of heaven inspired geologist&#146;  (Hawkins to Mantell <i>c</i>.1832, in Steer). Yet Martin's work was also criticized for relying too heavily on the works of others, particularly Mantell's 1822 <span class="italic">South Downs</span> and later publications.<br>
<br>Mantell himself hoped to chastise &#145;the over-weening vanity and dogmatism&#146;  (Mantell to Hawkins, 3 Jan 1832, Hawkins MSS, W. Sussex RO) which he unearthed in Martin's book. Ironically, one of Martin's lasting achievements was the coining of the term &#145;Wealden&#146;, describing certain strata in Sussex which Mantell had first determined as being of freshwater origin. In later years, as evidenced in Mantell's own journal, the two men became friendly despite these early quarrels, often exchanging visits, specimens, and letters. Ultimately however, Martin's own writings refer to the Huttonian school of thought for explanations of Wealden geology too frequently to be regarded as seminal by modern workers. His strengths as a geologist stemmed from his detailed and accurate local observations, rather than grander deductions and theories.<br>
<br>Martin's interests extended far beyond geology. He contributed papers on tumuli and Roman roads to the <span class="italic">Sussex Archaeological Collections</span>, and on gardening to the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> (mostly between 1841 and 1845 and often under the initials &#145;P. P.&#146;), as well as lecturing on literature to the Philosophical and Literary Society of Chichester (1833&#150;4). He was a capable musician and was noted by obituarists as having great powers of memory and knowledge of the arts, and a delightful style of conversation. As a doctor, Martin was very popular and with a career spanning over forty years was much sought after for consultations and opinions. He published one medical paper, &#145;Case of hereditary ichthyosis&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Medical and Chirurgical Society</span> in 1818. He died at Pulborough on 13 May 1860.<br>
