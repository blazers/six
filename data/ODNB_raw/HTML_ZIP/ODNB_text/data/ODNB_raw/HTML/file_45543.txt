<span class="headword">Bottome <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em> Forbes-Dennis]</span>,  Phyllis</span>  (1882&#150;1963), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 31 May 1882 in Rochester, Kent, the third of four children of William MacDonald Bottome (<i>d</i>. 1913), an American clergyman, and Margaret Leatham of Yorkshire. She was educated largely at home, except for a brief period from 1890 to 1895 when she attended a Catholic girls' boarding-school in New York, where her family had temporarily relocated. Returning to England in 1896, Bottome studied acting in London, but pneumonia kept her from her stage d&eacute;but. As a young woman Bottome enjoyed reading nineteenth-century women's fiction. In 1899 she wrote her first novel, <span class="italic">Life, the Interpreter</span>, published in 1902, a story of independent womanhood and an attack on class. Soon afterwards she learned she was afflicted with tuberculosis, and she began a lifelong pattern of travelling in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland for her health while still writing and publishing fiction in Britain and the United States. From 1904 to 1917 Bottome published a series of &#145;social romances&#146; that were serialized in American magazines. Just before the First World War she was living in London and was part of the literary circle which included Ezra Pound, H. D., and May Sinclair. Her novel <span class="italic">The Dark Tower</span> (1916; published in England as <span class="italic">Secretly Armed</span>) was a popular American publication.<br>
<br>In 1917 Bottome married Captain Alban Ernan Forbes-Dennis (<i>d</i>. 1972), who was also tubercular (they had met some years previously at St Moritz and had been engaged in 1904 before Bottome broke it off because of her health). While Forbes-Dennis was at the front, Bottome worked as a writer for the Ministry of Information under John Buchan, and as a relief worker for Belgian refugees. Forbes-Dennis's role as a diplomatist after the First World War required that the couple travel widely in Europe where, in Vienna in 1920, Bottome helped the social worker Valerie Adler and her husband the psychiatrist Alfred Adler with relief work.<br>
<br>Between 1917 and 1924 Bottome published seven more novels building on the themes of social ills and women's struggle with identity and success in a patriarchal society. <span class="italic">Old Wine</span>, released in 1926, brought Bottome critical acclaim for its description of post-war Austria. Bottome was analysed by Alfred Adler in the 1930s before moving to Munich, where she witnessed the Nazi rise to power. She produced a pamphlet in tribute to Stella Benson in 1934, but her next significant publication was <span class="italic">Private Worlds</span> (1934), a novel about mental illness which was made into a film in 1935 starring Claudette Colbert and Charles Boyer. In 1936 Bottome returned to England and wrote articles warning against the Nazi threat. While these generated little response, her novel <span class="italic">The Mortal Storm</span> (1937), which explored the same ideas, was an instant best-seller, particularly in America. It was filmed in 1940 with James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan in the leading roles. In 1939 Bottome published a biography of Adler, for which she conducted primary research in Austria, narrowly avoiding Hitler's entry into that country at the start of the Second World War. <span class="italic">Within the Cup</span> (1943) was also successful for Bottome, who incorporated Adlerian psychological theories, and presented sensitive portrayals of characters in conflict with themselves and society.<br>
<br>In 1947 Bottome published the first of her three autobiographies, <span class="italic">Search for a Soul: Fragment of an Autobiography</span>. This was followed by <span class="italic">The Challenge</span> in 1952 and <span class="italic">The Goal</span> in 1962. These three books provide most of what is known about Bottome. She continued to write and publish novels at a rate of one or two a year between 1940 and 1960.<br>
<br>Bottome died on 22 August 1963 at her home, Little Greenly, 95 South End Road, Hampstead, London. Her friend Daphne Du Maurier edited her collected stories in 1963. In her long career Bottome wrote on a wide range of subjects in several genres, producing popular, feminist novels and, in her non-fiction, raising the public's awareness of political dangers; her recurring theme was personal freedom. Her works were translated into many European languages.<br>
