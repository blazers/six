<span class="headword">Preston,  John, of Penicuik</span>, Lord Fentonbarns  (<em>d.</em> 1616), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of John Preston (<i>fl</i>. 1533&#150;1585), burgess and dean of guild of Edinburgh, and his wife, Marion Nicoll. He matriculated at St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1564, and graduated BA in 1566 and MA in 1568. Admitted advocate in 1575, his first judicial appointment was in 1580 to the commissary court of Edinburgh, which had jurisdiction in testamentary and consistorial causes. He was elected a senator of the college of justice on 8 March 1596 on James VI's nomination, and took his seat in the court of session on 12 March. He took his judicial title of Lord Fentonbarns from a property in East Lothian he had acquired in 1579, and continued to use it after his purchase of the barony of Penicuik, Midlothian, in 1604. Exceptionally he continued as one of the four commissaries until 1599. Appointed to the privy council in 1596, he became one of its most active members, serving on numerous commissions and committees.<br>
<br>In 1598 Sir George Home of Wedderburn, the comptroller, had severe problems in financing the royal households. On 31 October he entered into a contract with Preston by which the latter agreed to take on Home's offices of collector-general of the thirds of benefices and treasurer of the new augmentation. Any surplus from the revenue, which derived from ecclesiastical benefices and temporalities, was to be applied towards furnishing the households. Preston may have owed his formal appointment a month later to the friendship of John Erskine, eighteenth earl of Mar. In February 1599 James was reportedly angered by the refusal of the treasurer, the comptroller, and the collector, all of them Mar's friends, to give surety for the price of diamonds purchased from George Heriot, goldsmith. In July 1600 he was again said to be angry with the treasurer and collector &#145;for that they give him not money enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 1597&#150;1603, 673). Nevertheless, Preston was nominated on 2 October 1601 as one of eight commissioners to assist the new treasurer, Sir George Home of Spot.<br>
<br>Preston also had a supporting role in James's ecclesiastical policy, beginning with his appointment in March 1596 as one of the king's two commissioners to the general assembly. In December 1596 James empowered him to make overtures to the ministers of Edinburgh following the riot there, and on 6 January 1597 he was appointed to advise the magistrates on the trial of those involved. Over the next ten years he represented the king at various synods and provincial assemblies. In January 1606 he was an assessor at the trial of the ministers accused of convoking an illegal general assembly at Aberdeen, dissenting from two rulings by the justice-depute. At the convention of estates in December 1606 he made &#145;a large discourse of the paines and travells which his majestie had tane in the effaires of the kirk&#146;, ending &#145;with exhortatioun to give his Hienesse satisfactioun&#146;  (Calderwood, 6.605). He was appointed to the new courts of high commission in 1610.<br>
<br>On 23 December 1607 the lords of session elected Preston to be vice-president in Lord President Balmerino's absence. He was an assessor at Balmerino's trial for treason in March 1609, and following his conviction the lords of session elected Preston as best qualified to succeed him, on 6 June 1609. By then Preston's financial offices were of diminished importance, owing partly to the restoration of temporalities to the bishops in 1606 and partly to substantial grants of former church lands and revenues. Preston himself had pensions amounting to &pound;1087 10<i>s</i>. Scots and 24 &#145;bolls&#146; of meal from various abbacies for his own and his eldest son's lifetimes. On 15 November 1610 George Home, earl of Dunbar, was appointed to the combined offices of treasurer, comptroller, collector, and treasurer of the new augmentation. Though requiring Preston to demit his offices, thereby ceasing to rank as an officer of state, James preserved his status by stipulating that he was to continue as a member of the privy council and its president in the lord chancellor's absence. Preston was also one of the seven assessors nominated to assist the treasurer-depute in Dunbar's absence. After Dunbar's death he was one of eight commissioners, known as the New Octavians, appointed in April 1611 to manage the royal finances. Later that year, when told that the king expected to have some surplus revenue from Scotland, Preston commented: &#145;I wald thai[r] wer money, but it must not go to England&#146;  (Laing, 1.282). The treasury commission terminated in December 1613, but Preston retained his presidencies of the court of session and privy council until his death on 14 June 1616.<br>
<br>Preston had three wives, each the widow of an advocate. He married first, in 1583, Elizabeth Fawside, widow of Clement Little, who died in the same year after giving birth to his eldest son, John. About 1588 he married Lilias Gilbert, widow of Alexander Mauchan, who was the mother of his other children, Michael, George, James, and Catherine. She had died by 1609, when he married Margaret Collace, widow of Sir John Shairp of Houston, who survived him, dying on 25 September 1617. Margaret owned the estate of Muirtown, near Forres, Moray, which passed to the son of her first marriage to Walter Reid, commendator of Kinloss. Though Penicuik had been destined for Preston's second son, Michael, he had agreed with his elder brother in 1612 to exchange it for Fentonbarns. It thus passed to Sir John Preston of Airdrie, who sold it in 1647. He had acquired the estate of Airdrie in Fife by marrying Elizabeth Turnbull, the heiress, and was created a baronet in 1628. Sir Michael Preston of Fentonbarns married Marion, daughter of John Hay of Kennet, in 1616. Catherine, who married Robert Nairn, advocate, was the mother of Robert Nairn of Strathord, first Lord Nairne (<i>d</i>. 1683).<br>
