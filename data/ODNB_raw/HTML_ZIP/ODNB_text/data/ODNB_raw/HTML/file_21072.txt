<span class="headword">Packe,  Christopher</span>  (1686&#150;1749), <span class="occ">physician and cartographer</span>, was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 6 March 1686 and was probably the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21071/', "Christopher Packe (b. in or before 1657, d. in or after 1708)")</script>, chemist. Little is known of his life, but he was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 11 September 1695; received the degree of doctor of medicine at Cambridge in 1717, <i>comitiis regiis</i>; and was admitted as a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1723. In January 1726 he presented an organ to St Peter's Church, St Albans. On 30 July of that year he married Mary Randolph of the precincts, Canterbury, in Canterbury Cathedral and from about that date settled with her in Canterbury, where he practised medicine until his death.<br>
<br>In 1726 and 1727 Packe was embroiled in a heated controversy and pamphlet war with Dr John Gray of Canterbury. The dispute concerned the treatment of one Robert Worger of Hinxhill, Kent, who died of &#145;concussion of the brain&#146; after falling from his horse. Worger had at first been treated by Packe, but his relatives, not satisfied with Packe's methods, called in Gray and two surgeons, who, Packe argued, caused Worger's death by excessive bleeding and trepanning.<br>
<br>As well as contributing several papers to <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, Packe published two cartographical works: <span class="italic">A dissertation upon the surface of the earth, as delineated in a specimen of a philosophical-chorographical chart of East Kent</span> (1737) and <span class="italic"><i>Ankographia</i></span> (1743, by subscription), an expanded version of the former. Cartography occupied Packe's thoughts during &#145;many otherwise tedious journeys&#146; around his Kent practice  (Jarcho, 52), and both works endeavoured to describe and explain the topography around Canterbury by using charts which Packe had made by taking bearings from the tower of Canterbury Cathedral. They also indicate that Packe considered the structure of the human body to be a microcosm of the natural world, for when writing of the River Stour he claimed that its<blockquote>minute Division and Graphic Portrait of the Vallies and their Waters &hellip; differ[s] but little, if at all, from the Anatomical Descriptions of the several Systems of the Arteries, Veins, or Nerves, that are with such exquisite Art distributed all through our bodies. (Jarcho, 50)</blockquote>Packe died on 15 November 1749. He was buried in St Mary Magdalene, Canterbury, and left a son, Christopher, who also became a physician (graduating bachelor of medicine from Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1751); who also practised in Canterbury; and who, after his death on 21 October 1800, aged seventy-two, was buried in St Mary Magdalene, alongside his father.<br>
