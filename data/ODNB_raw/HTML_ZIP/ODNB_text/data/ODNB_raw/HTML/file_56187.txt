<span class="headword">Gaisberg,  Frederick William</span>  (1873&#150;1951), <span class="occ">recording engineer and record company executive</span>, was born on 1 January 1873 in Washington, DC, the second of four children of Wilhelm Gaisberg and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Klenk. His father was the son of German &eacute;migr&eacute;s and worked at the United States Federal Printing Office. His mother encouraged the young Gaisberg to learn the piano, for which he had a natural talent. Gaisberg was educated in Washington, DC, until the age of sixteen, and was a chorister at St John's Episcopal Church.<br>
<br>The piano remained Gaisberg's first love, and as a schoolboy he earned pocket-money playing piano accompaniments for singers, comics, and others making cylinder records for the Columbia Phonograph Company. His name was announced on these records as &#145;Professor Gaisberg&#146;. In 1889 he met Charles Sumner Tainter, who had invented the cylinder graphophone, and through his influence he was sent to the American Graphophone factory at Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he was trained as a precision engineer. Returning to Washington, Gaisberg worked for the Columbia Phonograph Company, recruiting performers and accompanying them at recording sessions.<br>
<br>In 1894 Gaisberg met Emile Berliner, inventor of the gramophone, which used disc records. Upon first hearing a Berliner record Gaisberg was, in his own words, &#145;spell-bound by the beautiful round tone of the flat gramophone disc&#146;, which was, even in its infancy, far superior to the cylinder records. Gaisberg joined Berliner initially as an impresario and accompanist, but later as a Berliner-trained sound engineer, a training that formed the basis of his later career and achievements.<br>
<br>In 1898 Berliner sent Gaisberg to London where he established a recording studio making the first European disc records for the Gramophone Company, Berliner's British and European licensees. In 1899 this business was reconstructed and expanded. As a consequence, Gaisberg went on the first of his many European tours making records for the various distinctive local markets. As the company's principal recording engineer, he then travelled further afield, capturing on record the music of artists in Russia, India, and the Far East. However, Gaisberg's most important contribution to the Gramophone Company's success came in 1902, when he recorded the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso in Milan. These recordings not only enhanced Gaisberg's own reputation but also established the gramophone as an important means for spreading art and culture around the world. This was how Gaisberg viewed the gramophone record itself: as a means to an end. Years later, he told a colleague that he saw his task simply as one of making as many sound photographs or gramophone disc sides as possible during each recording session. Thus, Gaisberg did not view the recording process as an art form in itself, nor, modestly, did he view himself as an artist.<br>
<br>When Gaisberg made his first recording of Fyodor Chalyapin, the great Russian bass, he began a lifelong friendship which was to see him help Chalyapin escape Russia after the Bolshevik revolution. In the decades after the first Caruso recordings, Gaisberg built up the HMV label's classical catalogue, signing and recording important international performers such as Beniamino Gigli, Nellie Melba, John McCormack, and Fritz Kreisler. Gaisberg briefly considered quitting the business in 1918 after the death of his brother William from influenza after a recording expedition to the western front, but his determination kept him going. In 1921 Gaisberg became HMV's artistic director in the newly formed international artistes department, and, after the introduction of electrical recording in 1925, he abandoned recording in favour of artiste and repertoire management. Electrical recording nevertheless provided Gaisberg with the opportunity to both re-record many artistes and extend the range of music available on record. He remained artistic director after the formation of Electric and Musical Industries (EMI) in 1931, a depression-led merger between the Gramophone and Columbia Graphophone companies, and supervised the international artistes department during the dark days of the great depression, keeping faith in the viability of the recording industry even as the company's American affiliates RCA Victor and American Columbia were dissolving their catalogues and allowing Gaisberg to sign their artistes to the HMV and Columbia labels. Throughout the 1930s Gaisberg continued to develop newer artistes like the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, and deepened his working relationship with established performers, particularly the British composer and conductor Sir Edward Elgar.<br>
<br>At the age of sixty-six, in 1939, Gaisberg retired, allowing the men he had trained&#151;Walter Legge and David Bicknell&#151;to pick up the baton. Gaisberg remained a consultant to EMI for the rest of his life, and continued to have an important influence on the recording industry as a whole. In particular, in the late 1940s he argued in favour of long-play and stereophonic recording, both of which were introduced the following decade. Gaisberg never married and, apart from war enforced moves, he lived out the remainder of his life with his sister Carrie in London. During this time he wrote his memoirs, published in London as <span class="italic">Music on Record</span> in 1946, and he continued to travel extensively, particularly to his native USA.<br>
<br>The enormous regard and affection in which Fred Gaisberg was held was displayed at a banquet held at the Savoy Hotel on 21 April 1939 to honour his fifty years in the recording business and to mark his formal retirement. It was appropriately attended by figures from the world of recorded music which Gaisberg had helped to create, such as Sir Thomas Beecham, Gracie Fields, Richard Tauber, and Artur Rubinstein. Throughout his career, Gaisberg combined an artistic sensitivity with a friendly, modest, diplomatic nature which won him the respect and friendship of many. His dedication to and ingenuity within the recording industry remain legendary.<br>
<br>Gaisberg died in his sleep in the early hours of 2 September 1951 at his home, 42 Crediton Hill, Hampstead, London, and was buried in London later that month.<br>
