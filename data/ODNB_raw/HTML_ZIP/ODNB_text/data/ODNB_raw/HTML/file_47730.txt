<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peach,  (Clement) Blair</span>  (1946&#150;1979), <span class="occ">schoolteacher and victim of police brutality</span>, was born on 25 March 1946 in New Zealand. He was educated at the Victoria University of Wellington, where he was co-editor of a literary magazine, <span class="italic">Argot</span>. Following graduation he took a series of jobs (including as a hospital orderly) before emigrating to London in 1969. Soon after arrival he became a teacher at the Phoenix School in Bow, east London, a school for children with special needs, where he remained until his death. He joined the Socialist Workers' Party and was active in the Socialist Teachers' Association and, within the National Union of Teachers, the East London Teachers' Association, of which he became president in 1978. Meanwhile he formed a relationship with Celia Stubbs, which endured until his death.<br>
<br>Peach was particularly active in the anti-racist movement of the 1970s. In 1974 he was tried but acquitted on a charge of threatening behaviour after challenging a publican's refusal to serve black customers. The late 1970s saw the rise in visibility of far-right organizations such as the National Front, and Peach joined counter-demonstrations organized by the Anti-Nazi League. On 23 April 1979 he took part in a demonstration outside the town hall in Southall, west London, to protest against a meeting being held there by the National Front. The latter had few members in the area, and memories were still fresh of the murder of Gurdip Singh Chaggar by racist thugs in 1976. A petition signed by 10,000 residents seeking to have the meeting cancelled was ignored. On the day itself all the major local factories were closed by strikes. Some 2500 police were deployed to protect the few hundred National Front members from the protestors, estimated at between 3000 and 6000. When police cleared the area in front of the town hall the scene became violent; missiles were thrown, more than 40 people were injured (including 21 police), and there were more than 300 arrests. In a police raid on the Peoples Unite building, which was being used as a makeshift headquarters by the anti-racist demonstrators, Clarence Baker, manager of the band Misty in Roots, was beaten by police truncheons and left in a coma for five months.<br>
<br>Following the break-up of the demonstration Peach was sheltering on the corner of Beachcroft Avenue and Orchard Avenue, Southall, when about 8.30 p.m. a police carrier arrived, disgorging six members of the police's Special Patrol Group. Peach was beaten about the head, causing skull fractures. He was taken in by a local family, who called an ambulance, but he died early the next day at Ealing Hospital, Southall. His funeral, on 13 June, was attended by over 10,000 people. The inquest conducted from 28 April to 29 May 1980 by John Burton, coroner for Greater London (western district) was controversial: Burton made clear early on that he did not believe Peach had been killed by a policeman, and he was dismissive of the evidence of the fourteen witnesses, both other protestors and local residents, who, he said, &#145;did not have [the] experience of the English system&#146; to be reliable witnesses  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 22 Jan 2010). The inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure. Meanwhile, an internal Metropolitan Police inquiry was conducted by Commander John Cass. Peach's partner, Celia Stubbs, campaigned for the inquiry's findings to be made public, but it took thirty years to achieve her goal. Meanwhile the graffiti &#145;Who killed Blair Peach?&#146; became familiar on many London railway bridges and walls, and the police cover-up over his death was said by Lord Scarman to be a contributing factor to the Brixton riots of 1981.<br>
<br>Though some details had been leaked earlier, the Cass report and ancillary documents were finally published on 27 April 2010. It was clear that Cass had been reluctant to come to this conclusion, but the report stated that Peach had almost certainly been killed by one of six members of Special Patrol Group carrier U11 with an unauthorized weapon, such as a lead-weighted cosh or a rubberized police radio. Cass also reported that a raid on lockers at the Special Patrol Group headquarters had uncovered a variety of unauthorized weapons, including several coshes and illegal truncheons, knives, crowbars, and a 3 foot wooden stave, as well as in one locker a collection of Nazi regalia. Cass concluded that it was impossible to know with certainty which particular officer killed Peach, since the officers involved had refused to co-operate and evidence had been tampered with (all six officers' uniforms had been dry-cleaned before being handed over for inspection); nevertheless he strongly recommended that three officers should be charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. In the event no charges were ever brought.<br>
