<span class="headword">Davies,  Hugh</span>  (1739&#150;1821), <span class="occ">botanist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 3 April 1739 in Llandyfrydog, Anglesey, the youngest of six children of the Revd Lewis Davies, rector of Llandyfrydog, and his wife, Mary Knight. Only Hugh and two sisters survived their childhood. The father also died early, in 1750, but nevertheless the son was well educated at the free grammar school at Beaumaris and followed his father to Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1757 and gained his BA in 1762. He took holy orders, being ordained deacon in 1763 and priest in 1764. From 1763 to 1787, he was a cleric in Anglesey. He served curacies at Llangefni (1763&#150;6), Llan-faes and Penmon (1766&#150;75), and Penmynydd (1775&#150;8). At Llan-faes and Penmon he also held the post of usher at his old school at Beaumaris. In 1778 he was inducted rector of Llandegfan with Beaumaris. Even when he left Anglesey in 1787, he did not stray very far, merely crossing the Menai Strait to take up his ultimate appointment as rector of Aber, Caernarvonshire. About 1801, suffering from a nervous condition, he returned to live at Beaumaris, though he did not resign his benefice at Aber until 1816.<br>
<br>Davies's interest in natural history is first noted through his association with Thomas Pennant. Their friendship dated at least from the period when he was a young curate at Llan-faes and Penmon, sending specimens to his fellow naturalist. In 1774 he accompanied Pennant on his tour of the Isle of Man and returned the following summer to make a second review of the plant life on his behalf. From 1776 onwards Davies regularly helped authors, supplying them with details of the natural history of north Wales, particularly the botany of Anglesey and Caernarvonshire. He provided data for Pennant's <span class="italic">British Zoology</span> (4th edn, 1776&#150;7), for the same author's <span class="italic">Journey to Snowdon</span> (1781), and for William Hudson's <span class="italic">Flora Anglica</span> (2nd edn, 1788). In 1790 the second edition of Pennant's <span class="italic">Indian Zoology</span> was published; Davies made a considerable contribution to this volume, compiling most of the &#145;Indian faunula&#146; included therein. Other contributions were to <span class="italic">English Botany</span> by James Sowerby and James Edward Smith (1790&#150;1814) and to Smith's <span class="italic">Flora Britannica</span> (1800&#150;04), as well as to <span class="italic">The Botanist's Guide through England and Wales</span> (1805) by Dawson Turner and Lewis Weston Dillwyn.<br>
<br>In 1790, Davies was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society. He was an active member and four of his papers were read at its meetings and subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. Undoubtedly his main achievement was the publication of <span class="italic">Welsh Botanology</span> in 1813. This volume is important in several respects. It was the first published correlation of Welsh plant names with their binomial equivalents. The first part, a flora of Anglesey, has further importance as the first detailed flora of any of the Welsh counties. The second part (&#145;Llysieuaeth Gymreig&#146;) is also of special significance as it is considered, even today, as the most complete listing of Welsh plant names.<br>
<br>Specializing as he did in the detailed accumulation of the plant records of one area&#151;Anglesey&#151;Davies's achievements marked a big step forward from the random plant-hunting expeditions which so characterized botany in eighteenth-century Wales. He died, unmarried, at Beaumaris on 16 February 1821, and was buried in Beaumaris churchyard on the 21st. The genus <i>Daviesia</i> (Leguminosae), named by J. E. Smith in 1798, commemorates his services to botany.<br>
