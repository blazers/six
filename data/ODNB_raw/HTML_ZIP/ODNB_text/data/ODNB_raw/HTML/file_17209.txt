<span class="headword">Lushington,  Stephen</span>  (1782&#150;1873), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in London on 14 January 1782, the second of five children of Sir Stephen Lushington (1744&#150;1807) of South Hill Park, Berkshire, a director and later chairman of the East India Company, and his wife, Hester (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of John Boldero of Aspenden Hall, Hertfordshire. His father was created a baronet in 1791, the title passing to his older brother, Henry, in 1807.<br>
<br>Lushington was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took degrees in civil law. He matriculated in 1797, at fifteen, and graduated BA in 1802, MA in 1806, BCL in 1807, and DCL in 1808. He was elected a fellow of All Souls College in 1801 and held the fellowship until 1821, resigning it on his marriage as was then required. His marriage, on 8 August that year, was to Sarah Grace (<i>b</i>. 1794), daughter of Thomas William Carr (1770&#150;1829) of Frognal, Hampstead, Middlesex. She died in 1837 after a harrowing illness, by which Lushington was deeply moved. There were ten children, of whom one, Edward Harbord Lushington (1822&#150;1904), became a senior Indian civil servant, another, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53968/', "Vernon Lushington (1832&#150;1912)")</script>, a county court judge, and another, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38727/', "Godfrey Lushington (1832&#150;1907)")</script>, Vernon's twin, permanent under-secretary in the Home Office.<br>
<br>Lushington was called to the bar in 1806 (Inner Temple), and in 1808 he was admitted as a member of Doctors' Commons, the society of civil lawyers who, until 1858, constituted an independent branch of the English legal profession. The civilians had a monopoly in the practice of Admiralty law and of ecclesiastical law, which then included matrimonial disputes and the probate of wills.<br>
<br>Lushington had a distinguished career as a civilian, becoming judge of the most important diocesan court (the consistory court of London) in 1828, judge of the high court of Admiralty in 1838, and judge of the court of arches (the court of appeal for the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury) in 1858. As dean of the arches (as the judge was called) Lushington was also president of Doctors' Commons, attaining that office, however, only to preside over the dissolution of Doctors' Commons, because the law reforms of 1857, transferring jurisdiction over matrimonial cases and over the probate of wills to secular courts, effectively put an end to the separate profession of civil law. As Admiralty court judge he became a member of the judicial committee of the privy council, which was the final court of appeal from the English civilian courts, and from colonial courts throughout the British empire.<br>
<br>Lushington was a member of parliament in 1806&#150;8, and in 1820&#150;41 (with a short absence in 1830&#150;31). After the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832 he sat for the populous London borough of Tower Hamlets until his retirement from parliament in 1841. He was a consistent supporter of the whigs and described himself at the close of his parliamentary career as still a party man and strongly attached to party principles. However, Lushington voted independently where whig policy on sugar duties conflicted with his anti-slavery sentiments, and he did not hesitate to praise political opponents when he considered that they had embraced sound policies, as, for example, Peel on Catholic emancipation. He was described by a contemporary observer as a reformer, between the categories of whig and radical reformer. He was a forceful and effective speaker, who had the ear of the House of Commons. Lushington supported most of the liberal reforms of his era, including parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation, full civil rights for Jews and dissenters, and reform of the criminal law. He favoured the secret ballot, and triennial parliaments, but not universal suffrage&#151;not even universal adult male suffrage. He was one of the founders of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and spoke at the laying of the foundation stone of London University. Above all else he was constantly active, in and out of parliament, in the cause of anti-slavery.<br>
<br>The anti-slavery campaign was directed first at the abolition of the slave trade, which was achieved in 1807, and only later at the prohibition of slavery itself, which occurred in 1833. Lushington spoke and voted for the abolition of the slave trade in 1807. He was chiefly responsible for an act of 1824 to abolish the transfer of slaves between British colonies, a kind of intercolonial slave trade. He was extremely active in securing the emancipation act of 1833, working very closely with T. F. Buxton, Wilberforce's successor as leader of the anti-slavery movement. Buxton admired Lushington's diligence and judgement and relied on him heavily: Buxton's son, Charles, wrote that &#145;every idea, and every plan, was originated and arranged between them&#146;  (C. Buxton, <span class="italic">Memorials of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton</span>, 1850, 133). On the monument to emancipation erected in 1866 by Charles Buxton, Lushington's is one of the six names inscribed (the others being Buxton, Wilberforce, Clarkson, Macaulay, and Brougham). For many years after 1833 the slave trade was carried on under the flags of other nations, and Lushington played an active and important role in the campaign to suppress this trade, presiding over a committee in 1842 to draw up a code of instructions for British naval officers, and negotiating a treaty with France on this question in 1845.<br>
<br>The reason for Lushington's retirement from parliament in 1841 was a statute (the <span class="roman">Admiralty Court Act</span>) disqualifying the judge of the high court of Admiralty from membership of the House of Commons. Lushington himself saw no incompatibility in the two roles. Ten years later he was offered an opportunity to re-enter parliament as a life peer. There was an urgent need at the time for reform of the House of Lords in its role as a supreme judicial court. One solution canvassed was that distinguished judges might be appointed as life peers. The suggestion, however, was controversial because it altered the political balance between the government and the House of Lords, and, in the end, the idea was abandoned. Lushington was offered a life peerage in 1851, and the offer was repeated in 1856, but he, accurately foreseeing the political controversy that would ensue, declined both offers.<br>
<br>Lushington had a successful practice in Doctors' Commons until his appointment as Admiralty court judge. In 1816, as adviser to Lady Byron, he was largely instrumental in securing for her a separation from Lord Byron, the poet, a result for which Lady Byron was grateful throughout her life. In 1820 there occurred an enormous political sensation when a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to deprive the queen (Caroline of Brunswick) of her title and to dissolve her marriage with the king (George IV) on the ground of the queen's alleged adultery. The proceedings in the House of Lords were conducted as a trial, and Lushington was one of the counsel for the queen. He spoke in her defence forcefully, and, according to contemporary accounts, effectively. The defence was successful, and the bill (though it passed by a narrow margin) was dropped by the government. Lushington kept in close touch with the queen, who made him an executor of her will. He was present at her death, and accompanied her body for burial in Brunswick.<br>
<br>Lushington's judicial philosophy preceded the scientific school of thought that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century. The traditions of Doctors' Commons, where law reports only came into use at the beginning of the century, did not lend themselves to a theory that every point of law was objectively determinable. Nor did Lushington lean towards such a view: his decisions in the consistory court and in the Admiralty court show his determination to retain a large measure of flexibility, even at the cost of certainty and predictability. He gives the impression of a judge who has selected his own destination. The style of his judgments is confident, forceful, and persuasive, with frequent references to general considerations of justice. In matrimonial cases he showed himself very sympathetic to the interests of women, not because he favoured political rights for women (he did not) but because he thought that the wife was the weaker party and required the protection of the court for that reason. In the prize cases that came before him during the Crimean War, which he himself described as &#145;political&#146; cases, he showed himself very sympathetic to the interests of the British crown, and most impatient with technical arguments in the opposite direction. His judgments in instance (non-prize) cases in the Admiralty court were highly respected and widely influential, and continue to be cited throughout the English speaking world, well over a century after Lushington's death.<br>
<br>The mid-nineteenth century was a period of high controversy in the Church of England, and Lushington was at the centre of several disputes. One of the most politically controversial questions of the time was that of church rates, which were taxes levied on the whole population of a parish to support the fabric of the parish church. Rates were vigorously opposed by many of those who dissented from the Church of England. Lushington was pulled in two directions on this question. Politically his sympathies were with the dissenters, and he had spoken in parliament against church rates. But as an ecclesiastical court judge it was his duty to enforce the law, and in that capacity he caused the committal to prison of a conscientious objector to church rates, John Thorogood. In a case on a crucial legal point (the Braintree case) Lushington decided against the validity of the rate.<br>
<br>Other controversial ecclesiastical cases arose out of the revival of Catholic doctrine and ritual in the Church of England, and out of the beginning of a critical study of the scriptures. On these issues Lushington's decisions show him to be as conservative in theology as he was liberal in politics. He was himself a loyal churchman, and an attender at services in the parish church at Ockham, where he occupied the principal pew as one aspect of his role as conscientious and generous village squire. He had no sympathy whatever with the changes in church furnishings associated with the Gothic revival, nor with the introduction into the Church of England of what he saw as alien Catholic doctrines and practices. On the other hand he was not an evangelical, and his friends in the anti-slavery movement regretted that he was not &#145;truly religious&#146;. On the question of critical study of scripture Lushington had to judge an important book of essays published in 1860 (<span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>). He condemned two of the essayists, who, however, subsequently appealed successfully to the privy council.<br>
<br>After an illness in 1867, at the age of eighty-five, Lushington resigned his judicial offices but retained the administrative office of master of the faculties until his death in 1873, hearing disputed cases at his house in his ninety-first year. In December 1872 he travelled from Ockham in Surrey to Oxford in order to vote for A. P. Stanley in a controversial election for the office of select preacher. He returned the same day, fell ill, and died four weeks later, at his home, Ockham Park, Surrey, on 19 January 1873, just after his ninety-first birthday. A. P. Stanley was the generally acknowledged leader of the broad church party, who had been invited to contribute to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>, and whose views Lushington might be said to have condemned in his judgment, which Stanley had reviewed in a courteous, but critical, article. The journey to Oxford and back therefore suggests a gesture, and it was so perceived at the time. Stanley reciprocated by officiating at Lushington's funeral in Ockham church, and at his burial in the churchyard, on 20 January. Two weeks later Stanley paid handsome tribute to Lushington, describing him as:<blockquote>the venerable judge whose career was fired from first to last by a generous sympathy with human suffering, by noble indignation against wrong, [and] by a firm persuasion of the indissoluble bond between what was highest in religion and what was greatest in morality. (Waddams, 347)</blockquote>Lushington's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_17209"></a><span class="headword">Charles Lushington</span>  (1785&#150;1866), born in London on 14 April 1785, <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was secretary to the government of Bengal, 1823&#150;7. On returning to England he was elected to parliament for Ashburton, 1835&#150;41, and then for Westminster, 1847&#150;52. He was a reformer, favouring the ballot, triennial parliaments, and the extension of the suffrage. He opposed all religious privileges, and published three works on religious questions. He married, first, in 1805, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1839), daughter of General Joseph Gascoigne, and second, in 1844, Julia Jane, widow of Thomas Teed of Stanmore, Middlesex, who died in February 1866. Charles Lushington died at 118 Marine Parade, Brighton, Sussex, on 23 September 1866.<br>
