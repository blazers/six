<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perrins,  (Charles William) Dyson</span>  (1864&#150;1958), <span class="occ">book and porcelain collector and benefactor</span>, was born in the parish of Claines, near Worcester, on 25 May 1864, the only son of James Dyson Perrins (1823&#150;1887) and his wife and cousin, Frances Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1918), daughter of Charles Perrins. His grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39633/', "William Henry Perrins")</script>, was one of the original partners in the firm of Lea and Perrins, makers of Worcestershire sauce, from which the family derived its wealth. Educated at Charterhouse School (1878&#150;80) and the Queen's College, Oxford (where he matriculated in 1882), he served from 1888 in the 4th battalion of the Highland light infantry, but retired in 1892 with the rank of captain and began to devote himself to the family business and to public service.<br>
<br>On 16 October 1889 Perrins married Catherine Christina, daughter of Allan Gregory, corn merchant of Inverness. She died of a stroke in 1922 after suffering bad health for many years. They had two sons and two daughters. His second marriage, to Florence Winifred Midwood Milne, known as Frieda (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1882), took place on 6 September 1923. They had no children.<br>
<br>Perrins served as mayor of Worcester in the jubilee year 1897, and high sheriff of Worcestershire two years later. His benefactions went hand in hand with his services to public life and to education; after twenty-six years as a member of the governing body of the Worcester Royal Grammar School, in 1916 he became its chairman, a post he held for the next thirty-four years, and built for the school the Perrins Hall, in memory of his father, who had been a governor before him, and a science laboratory. He maintained a continuing interest in education as a life governor of Birmingham University and a member of the council of Malvern College. To Malvern, where he lived, he presented Rose Bank house and gardens on his retirement in 1918 from the chairmanship of the urban district council, and also gave the town its hospital (himself providing the site, buildings, and equipment) and its public library, in conjunction with the Carnegie Trust. His own university received from him a large gift of money to foster the study of organic chemistry, and a further sum for the construction of the laboratory named in his honour, which was opened in 1916 and for which Oxford expressed its gratitude in 1919 by making him an honorary DCL.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Perrins's name had begun to become familiar in the world of the arts and of book collecting. His father had collected pictures&#151;among them the great painting <span class="italic">Palestrina</span> from the middle period of J. M. W. Turner, which Dyson Perrins was to bequeath to the National Gallery&#151;but his own tastes were as wide, as were his means to gratify them, while his choice was as sure as his generosity was public-spirited in buying treasures and presenting them to appropriate national institutions. Always a discriminating benefactor, he gave or bequeathed objects of the highest artistic value and historic interest to, for example, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, and the British Museum, which received by bequest two of his most splendid manuscripts, to which his heir allowed a further eight to be added by purchase at a specially reduced price. The main period of his book collecting lay in the two decades from 1900 to 1920, when he boldly took opportunities, the like of which will hardly recur, to acquire manuscripts and printed books of the finest quality from a series of great auction sales such as those of the libraries of Lord Amherst, Bishop Gott, and A. H. Huth. He was no less inspired in his purchases by private treaty: in 1906 he bought thirty-three manuscripts from Charles Fairfax Murray, and in the same year acquired en bloc, on the eve of its dispersal by public auction, the great collection of early woodcut books formed by Richard Fisher of Midhurst.<br>
<br>Perrins's prowess as a collector was recognized in 1908 by his election to the Roxburghe Club, and though he wrote nothing himself his patronage and his collections led to the publication of a notable series of volumes written by scholars who enjoyed his friendship. First among these was the monograph on the Gorleston psalter, published in 1907 by Sydney Cockerell, on whose advice Dyson Perrins had bought the manuscript in 1904, under the very nose of his friend and rival Henry Yates Thompson. His own presentation volume to the Roxburghe Club followed in 1910, the <span class="italic">Epistole et evangelii &hellip; in lingua toscana</span>, reproducing more than 500 Florentine woodcuts from an all but unique 1495 edition which he owned. This was edited by A. W. Pollard, who went on to publish in 1914 <span class="italic">Italian book-illustrations and early printing: a catalogue of early Italian books in the library of C. W. Dyson Perrins</span>, which has remained an important work of reference. In 1916 the Roxburghe Club members jointly issued <span class="italic">Topographical Study in Rome in 1581</span>, edited by Thomas Ashby from a manuscript in Dyson Perrins's library. Four years later came the sumptuous <span class="italic">Descriptive Catalogue</span> of his illuminated manuscripts, the work of Sir George Warner, in two volumes, describing in detail what has proved to be almost the last, and certainly one of the finest, gatherings of illuminated manuscripts formed by a single individual of the golden age of private collecting. The end of the series inspired by the Dyson Perrins collections came with a volume published in 1927 devoted to another single manuscript, the <span class="italic">Apocalypse in Latin</span>, described by M. R. James.<br>
<br>Only a few additions were made after the issue of the 1920 catalogue of Perrins's manuscripts, but one such purchase, made from a Yates Thompson sale, was the finest of the three surviving mid-twelfth-century bindings executed at Winchester; this he later presented, with characteristic generosity, to Winchester Cathedral Library. In 1946 Dyson Perrins decided to sell his printed books, in order to spend the proceeds on what had always been one of his special interests, the Royal Worcester porcelain factory. His own collection of Worcester china, probably the best in existence, and as strong in everyday pieces as in special ones, he eventually presented to the china works, which he had so long befriended and supported. After the First World War, when the factory was in economic difficulties and closure would have added to local unemployment as well as ending a historic enterprise, Dyson Perrins himself had for a time taken over the management and kept the china works in operation at his own expense. After the Second World War he determined to re-equip the factory to resume production up to the highest standard of the past, and the money raised by the auction of his printed books at four sales during 1946&#150;7, which totalled &pound;147,627, was earmarked for this purpose. After his death his illuminated manuscripts, with a few outstanding printed books, were dispersed in three auction sales during 1958&#150;60, at which foreign national libraries competed with booksellers from all over the world to pay a record sum for only 154 lots. Including the earlier printed book sales and the British Museum's private purchases, the Dyson Perrins library brought nearly &pound;1,100,000, the largest amount fetched to that time by a single individual's collection.<br>
<br>Despite the fame of his possessions and the publicity attendant on his numerous benefactions Dyson Perrins was personally extremely modest and deliberately shunned the limelight. Besides his various fields of collecting he enjoyed pursuits such as photography, and was a keen sportsman, for whom an estate in Ross-shire provided the stalking, fishing, and shooting in which he delighted. However, the estate was sold in 1937 when his other financial commitments meant he could no longer afford its upkeep. Perrins died at his home, Davenham, Malvern, on 29 January 1958. His second wife survived him.<br>
