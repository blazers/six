<span class="headword">Jermy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Withers]</span>,  Louise Jane <span class="st"> [Louisa]</span></span>  (1877&#150;1952), <span class="occ">domestic servant and autobiographer</span>, was born on 30 January 1877 at Howe Lane, Romsey, Hampshire, on the Broadlands estate where her maternal grandmother, Sarah Medley, was laundress to the &#145;great house&#146;. Her mother, Selina (<i>c</i>.1844&#150;1879), died when Louise was eighteen months old. Her elder sister Amy lived with their paternal grandparents in Romsey, while Louise was brought up by Sarah Medley in Kents almshouse in Romsey. Widowed at twenty-three, their father, St John Withers (<i>c</i>.1856&#150;<i>c</i>.1923), a labourer twelve years younger than his first wife, remarried and went with his second wife, Mary, to London, where he worked in a variety of small businesses.<br>
<br>Louise Withers was taken out of school at eleven to help in her stepmother's home-based laundry business. The heavy labour, as well as severe physical abuse from her stepmother, caused Louise to be partially disabled when she was thirteen. She was sent in 1890 to her stepmother's aunt and uncle in Radwinter, Essex, to recuperate; in January 1891 she was sent back to Broadlands to live with her widowed paternal grandfather in Ashfield. There she knitted socks which were sold by a Romsey shop. She returned to London in September 1891. Not fit enough for laundry work, she opted for dress making. She was also expected to help look after two stepbrothers, and was again beaten by her stepmother. She was hospitalized after regular fainting fits and the onset of severe headaches, and then sent back to her paternal grandfather for four months' recuperation. Though unable to complete her two-year apprenticeship, Louise had become a proficient dress maker by 1893. By then she was attending Sunday school, where she confided in and was supported by the teacher. She also wrote verse, in which she expressed her bitterness about the ill treatment she suffered from her stepmother. At sixteen she confronted her stepmother when the stepmother tried to prevent her from reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. On her seventeenth birthday her father presented her with her own <span class="roman">Bible</span>, his first birthday present to her. She was forced from her first dress making job (1893&#150;4) by her stepmother, who thought she was not earning enough.<br>
<br>Louise decided, despite her disability, to go into service. Though she found more freedom in domestic service, her stepmother again prevailed upon her to leave her first position with a Roman Catholic brother and sister in Kensington because of low wages (&pound;7 a year, with board and lodging). In her second position her health suffered. Her next position (1895) led to a move to Birmingham in 1897. She was encouraged by her employer, a suffragist, to improve her education. Recurring problems with her hip led her to leave that position, and after a series of live-in jobs she returned in 1901 to London, where she found work as a cook with a Jewish family called Klein from 1903.<br>
<br>She moved with the Klein family about 1910 to Wroxham, Norfolk, and there met her future husband, John Jermy (1862/1863&#150;<i>c</i>.1922), a farm labourer, the son of John Jermy, a gardener. Her father objected that John earned too little (13<i>s</i>. a week) and had poor health, but her stepmother, with whom she was now reconciled, supported her choice of marriage partner. They married at Wroxham parish church on 25 February 1911, and their first son was born on Christmas eve 1911. A second son was born in 1916. John Jermy died about 1922. Louise then worked on the land, and when that work gave out she worked as her maternal grandmother had done, as a laundry worker for the lady of the manor. Her father died about 1923, leaving everything to his third wife and their son.<br>
<br>Louise Jermy was unusual for a working-class woman in writing an autobiography, <span class="italic">The Memories of a Working Woman</span>, published in Norwich in 1934 with a foreword by Ralph Hale Mottram, who commented that it was &#145;said to be the first autobiography written by a Women's Institute member&#146;, though the Women's Institute is not mentioned in the memoir itself. Her branch at Hoveton held an official reception on the book's publication, at which she read a letter of congratulations from the queen, who had purchased a copy. Structured around a conventional working-class chronology (birth, childhood, family, work, illness, death, though precise dates are often lacking), the memoir is descriptive not just of events but of emotions. It is a powerful story of a life of struggle and suffering, from which domestic service offered not only an escape but also opportunities to improve her education (through a reading class and piano lessons). The memoir shows how strong the ties of family were, even for someone removed through work and marriage from the parental home. Louise Jermy died at her home, 23 Hoveton St John, Hoveton, Norfolk, on 28 October 1952.<br>
