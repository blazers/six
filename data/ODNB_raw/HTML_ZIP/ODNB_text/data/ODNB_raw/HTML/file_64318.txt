<span class="headword">Mocatta,  David Alfred</span>  (1806&#150;1882), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 17 February 1806, the son of Moses Mocatta (1768&#150;1857), bullion dealer, and Abigail Lindo (1775&#150;1824). A pioneer of Jewish entry into the artistic professions, he was from February 1821 a pupil of Sir John Soane for a period of six years. He was awarded the medal of the Society of Arts in 1825, and afterwards travelled in Italy, exhibiting paintings of Rome at the Royal Academy in 1831&#150;2. His training, influences, and artistic inclinations were classical. He worked on the drawings for the Bank of England (1826&#150;7) and submitted designs in the competition in 1839 for the Royal Exchange, London. He designed several London synagogues: the Reform in Bruton Street (1841), the West London Synagogue in Great St Helen's Street (1851), which congregation he and his father helped to found, and the Montefiore in Ramsgate (1833). One of the first fellows of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), he was elected in 1837 and eventually became a vice-president of the institute. In 1835 he married Knendal (Ann) Susskind (1814&#150;1896) at the Spanish and Portuguese Jews' synagogue in Bevis Marks, London.<br>
<br>It was perhaps in his designs for the railway that Mocatta made his most important contribution to British architecture. He designed Brighton Station and several others for the London and Brighton Railway. His drawings in 1840 and 1841 for stations at Croydon, Redhill and Reigate Road, Horley, Crawley, Haywards Heath, Hassocks, and Brighton survive in the drawings collection of the RIBA. The intermediate stations were all built with white Suffolk brick and Yorkshire stone cornices. The internal layout was practical and well designed, and the exterior style was usually single-storeyed, with an Italianate or Doric appearance, but Horley was a two-storey design with a Tudor feel. The Brighton station was designed in 1839&#150;40 and housed the railway company's headquarters, offices, and board-room. The buildings were in a dignified Italianate style, three storeys high, with an arcaded entrance. The platforms were covered by a saw-toothed roof 250 feet long. This is the only one of his stations still in use at the end of the twentieth century, but extensions have since obscured the original building.<br>
<br>Mocatta worked with the engineer of the London and Brighton Railway, John Urpeth Rastrick (1780&#150;1856), on his greatest work, the Ouse Valley Viaduct, north of Haywards Heath. This otherwise monotonous brick structure, 491 yards long and 96 feet high, and consisting of thirty-seven semicircular arches each spanning 30 feet, was ennobled by Mocatta's embellishments. He designed eight stone and brick pavilions, placing four at each end, two on each side of the line, and a stone balustrade which runs from end to end, punctuated every 30 feet with a safety refuge projecting beyond the balustrade. The design is simple yet exuberant and triumphant. Mocatta ceased to work for the railway in 1843, though in 1845 he made detailed drawings for a central London terminus in Farringdon Street (RIBA). He won the competition for the design of the London Fever Hospital, although his design was set aside in favour of a lesser one. He designed offices for Whiteknights Park, Reading (1844), Stowlangtoft Hall, Suffolk (1845), and the Imperial Insurance Company (1846).<br>
<br>On inheriting a fortune from his father in 1857 Mocatta retired from architectural practice and busied himself with philanthropic work, particularly for hospitals. He was a leader in the struggle for Jewish emancipation, a most active promoter of the Architects' Benevolent Society, a senior trustee of Sir John Soane's Museum, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He died on 1 May 1882 at his home, 32 Prince's Gate, South Kensington, London, and was buried at the Kingsbury Road Jewish cemetery on 5 May.<br>
