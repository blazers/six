<span class="headword">Marshall,  (James) Norman Hamilton</span>  (1901&#150;1980), <span class="occ">theatre director</span>, was born at Rawalpindi, India, on 16 November 1901, the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel Daniel Grove Marshall of the Indian Medical Service and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackie). He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and at Worcester College, Oxford, where he gained a second in English in 1925. After a false start as a journalist in London and a brief spell as an actor in a touring company, he found his real&#151;and lifelong&#151;niche when appointed &#145;stage director&#146; (&#145;stage manager&#146; in later terminology) by Terence Gray at the Cambridge Festival Theatre in 1926. After less than a year he was promoted one of the resident directors of the theatre, his first production there being C. K. Munro's <span class="italic">The Rumour</span> in 1927. In the next six years the Festival Theatre gave Marshall, in his late twenties, play-producing opportunities that were then unique. A selection of the plays produced there illustrates the kind of theatre that Marshall and the brave, celebrated but short-lived Cambridge Festival Theatre were excited about: <span class="italic">The Insect Play</span> (&#268;apek), <span class="italic">Beggar on Horseback</span> (Kaufman and Connelly), <span class="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</span> (Beaumont), <span class="italic">The Emperor Jones</span> (O'Neill), <span class="italic">The Shoemaker's Holiday</span> (Dekker). They were different, both from each other and&#151;especially when put together in a single programme at one theatre&#151;from the great mass of plays produced at other theatres at the time, and established Marshall as a pioneer of non-commercial theatre.<br>
<br>Marshall's first London production was in June 1928, a single Sunday-evening performance for the Stage Society, the play being Franz Werfel's <span class="italic">Paul among the Jews</span>. In his book <span class="italic">The Other Theatre</span> (1947), Marshall himself says:<blockquote>The actual performance went off without mishap but as a production it did not make much impression on any of the critics except St. John Ervine, who in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> advised me to abandon forthwith all hopes I might have of ever becoming a producer [director]. He helpfully suggested the profession of a nonconformist minister as more suitable.</blockquote>Fortunately, the alternative profession was never needed because from 1932 onwards he was continuously in demand as a director of plays in London, New York, and elsewhere (including Israel and South Africa). Especially notable is his work as the artistic director at the Gate Theatre, London, throughout the 1930s where, among many other things, he introduced London audiences to the plays of Jean-Jacques Bernard (for example, <span class="italic">Martine</span>, <span class="italic">The Unquiet Spirit</span>, <span class="italic">The Springtime of Others</span>).<br>
<br>From 1940 to 1942 Marshall served in the army. In December 1942 he was discharged from the fighting forces and formed his own theatre company, in association with the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (the forerunner of the Arts Council of Great Britain). The company toured extensively in England for the rest of the war. From 1943 to 1949 he directed no less than fifteen London productions, following these with a production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> which toured the British, French, and American zones of occupied Germany. In 1950 he directed <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> at the Florence festival and in 1952 Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span> at the Cameri Theatre in Israel. His long string of London productions continued until 1972. Some of these, so far as choice of play is concerned, show a distinct decline of his formerly artistically adventurous spirit; he was, in many cases, content to ride the easy waves of current commercial success.<br>
<br>Norman Marshall wrote two highly regarded books: <span class="italic">The Other Theatre</span> (1947) and <span class="italic">The Producer and the Play</span> (1957). He also published an edition of Congreve's plays (1959). He was the head of drama for Associated Rediffusion Ltd from 1955 to 1959, chairman of the British Council's drama committee (1961&#150;8), chairman of the British Theatre Association (1961&#150;4), and joint chairman, with Sir Laurence Olivier, of the National Theatre building committee. He served for a number of years as one of the governors of the Old Vic and was Shute lecturer on drama at the University of Liverpool, for the academic year 1953&#150;4.<br>
<br>Marshall was enormously sensitive to what he saw as a developing danger in British theatre. Particularly in the latter part of his career he often referred to it both in his lectures and in private conversation, and he included a trenchant reference to it in the 1975 edition of <span class="italic">The Producer and the Play</span>:<blockquote>Seventeen years ago I finished this book by declaring my belief in the Director's Theatre as the healthiest form of theatre. Now I have my doubts. It is all too possible, as John Barbour [Barber] warned in an article in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, that we may be approaching the days when directors are richer, cleverer, more famous and more in demand than authors&#151;or indeed actors. &#145;I find it&#146;, says Barbour, &#145;a disturbing thought&#146;. So do I. (p. 344)</blockquote>There were no distractions from his continuous, incessant theatre work, and no digressions; scarcely any recreations or &#145;hobbies&#146;. Over the luncheon table or the dinner table he was silent until the theatre was mentioned. Instantly he would become quietly animated, illustrating his often-challenging views with a wealth of remembered incidents and instances. &#145;Go to the theatre all the time&#146;, he would say: &#145;Even if some of the plays are awful, still go: it's the only way to learn. Don't just <i>talk</i> about it. Go to the theatre.&#146; Although invariably the most knowledgeable person present, he presented that vast range of learning and experience with charm, almost with diffidence. On one occasion he turned to his nearest neighbour at table and said &#145;Do just remind me&#151;how does <span class="italic">The Man with a Load of Mischief</span> end?&#146; This was in 1978: the play in question (written by Ashley Dukes) was last played in London in 1924 and the rest of the luncheon party had either long forgotten it or had never even heard of it.<br>
<br>Marshall was appointed CBE in the birthday honours list of 1975. He never married. He died at St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, after a brief illness, on 7 November 1980.<br>
