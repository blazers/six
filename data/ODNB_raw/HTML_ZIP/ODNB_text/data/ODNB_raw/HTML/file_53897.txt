<span class="headword">Carroll,  Walter</span>  (1869&#150;1955), <span class="occ">music educationist and composer</span>, was born on 4 July 1869 at 156 Bury New Road, Manchester, the only son and last of the five children of Robert Carroll (<i>bap</i>. 1829), a commercial traveller, and his wife, Fanny Wormald, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Flinn (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1832). The Carroll family had no privileges of birth, money, or schooling nor any special musical interest. After leaving Longsight high school at fourteen Carroll started work as a textile warehouse clerk. At the same time he attended evening classes in piano, organ, and music theory, and joined the choir of St Chrysostom's Anglican church, Victoria Park, Manchester. The development of pericarditis at seventeen left him with a permanently damaged heart but also with a determination to succeed in his musical training.<br>
<br>In 1891 Carroll was among the first to graduate with the external MusB degree from the University of Durham and was appointed singing master to the Manchester Day Training College. On 3 October 1893 he gave the inaugural lecture at a new conservatory, the Royal Manchester College of Music. He took up a lectureship there in harmony and composition at the invitation of Charles Hall&eacute;, the first principal. In 1894 he was awarded the degree of MusB by the University of Manchester, and in 1900 he was the first to gain its degree of MusD by examination. He was appointed lecturer in music at the same university in 1904, and served as dean of the faculty of music in 1909&#150;11 and 1917&#150;19.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1896 Carroll married Gertrude Southam (<i>b</i>. 1868). They had two daughters, Elsa and Ida (1906&#150;1995). The latter, like her father, pursued a musical career; she became principal of the Northern School of Music, Manchester, in 1956, and was elected president of the Incorporated Society of Musicians in 1976.<br>
<br>In 1906 Carroll established lectures in the teaching of music at the Royal Manchester College of Music. A year later he founded a training class for music teachers in Manchester, which ran until 1919. Hundreds of teachers benefited from lectures and demonstrations. He lectured throughout England, Scotland, and Wales at the invitation of education authorities and professional associations. Prominent among these was the Incorporated Society of Musicians, of which he was a member from 1896 to 1911, holding the highest regional and national offices.<br>
<br>In 1909 Carroll was appointed as the first professor in a new department&#151;the art and practice of teaching&#151;at the Royal Manchester College of Music. His overriding aim was stated in 1910: &#145;Gradually to substitute the trained teacher for the untrained is a work full of glorious possibilities for the art of music&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester City News</span>, 2 April 1910, 8). In 1918 he renounced his academic posts serving the musically talented to devote himself to under-privileged elementary schoolchildren, on his appointment as the first music adviser to Manchester education committee. When his post was made permanent in 1920 he was the first full-time music adviser in Britain.<br>
<br>Carroll's pioneering work in schools, which included lectures and practical sessions with children and teachers, was inspirational. In 1919 an innovatory scheme of teaching music appreciation was established. He organized concerts for children and founded both a children's orchestra and the Manchester Elementary Schools' Choir. The culmination of his efforts came on 4 June 1929 when 250 schoolchildren made a gramophone recording with the Hall&eacute; Orchestra conducted by Hamilton Harty in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester. This Columbia recording&#151;a unique event in British music education&#151;of Purcell's <span class="italic">Nymphs and Shepherds</span> and the dance duet from Humperdinck's <span class="italic">Hansel and Gretel</span> has no parallel and remains a permanent legacy.<br>
<br>By the time of his retirement in 1934 Carroll had given some 1200 specimen lessons in Manchester schools, and 11,187 schoolteachers had attended his courses of lectures. In 1934 alone 12,000 children were taught music appreciation. When his career began the concept of education was limited. Little time was allotted to the teaching of music or to the training of teachers. Forty years later his pioneering work had brought about a change of emphasis. The importance of music within the curriculum had been recognized. Education authorities and advisory staff, at home and abroad, as well as thousands of teachers and several generations of schoolchildren, came under his influence.<br>
<br>Carroll was director of music at St James's Church, Rusholme, Manchester, from 1916 until 1938. His choral music is rarely performed. He lives on in his piano music for children. From 1912 to 1953 he composed a series of descriptive and imaginative piano works, integrating music, poetry, and design, commencing with <span class="italic">Scenes at a Farm</span>. For later volumes such as <span class="italic">Forest Fantasies</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">River and Rainbow</span> (1933) Carroll employed the foremost illustrators of the day, including Arthur Rackham and William Heath Robinson. Leading a new era in the education of child pianists Carroll ranks among the finest twentieth-century composers for children.<br>
<br>In his retirement Carroll continued composing for children, producing essays and booklets on music education and lecturing throughout the country. He died at his home, Glenluce, Lapwing Lane, Didsbury, Manchester, on 9 October 1955.<br>
