<span class="headword">Man,  James</span>  (1700?&#150;1761), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, was born at Whitewreath, Elgin, Moray, the son of John Man, an impoverished small farmer. He was educated at the parish school of Longbride, Elgin, and King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA on 15 April 1721. He was licensed to preach but, being unable to obtain a church, was never ordained as a minister. He became schoolmaster of Tough (Kirkton-on-Tough), Aberdeenshire, before being appointed master of the poor's hospital in Aberdeen on 11 December 1742.<br>
<br>In 1741 Man advertised his projected <span class="italic">Memoirs of Scotish Affairs from 1624 to 1651</span>, collected from unpublished manuscripts, to be published in parts at three-halfpence per sheet; but it seems that only the first part was printed, consisting of Man's introduction and four pages of memoirs, mostly extracted from a manuscript &#145;History of Scots affairs&#146; by James Gordon (1615?&#150;1686), borrowed from Gordon's grandson. However, two volumes of Man's extracts from seventeenth-century manuscripts survive in the National Library of Scotland.<br>
<br>Other uncompleted projects were an edition of the Latin poems of Arthur Johnston (1587&#150;1641) and a history of the Church of Scotland in which Man was encouraged by the general assembly of the church and for which he was qualified &#145;by learning and diligence, and above all by his zeal of Presbytery and ardour of Whiggism&#146;  (Chalmers, 263&#150;4). He did, however, complete <span class="italic">A censure and examination of Mr Thomas Ruddiman's philological notes on the works of the great Buchanan</span> (1753), a learned but abusive work, 574 pages long, attacking what Man, like other vocal presbyterian scholars before him, believed was anti-protestant bias and poor Latinity in an edition of George Buchanan's works (1715) by Thomas Ruddiman (1674&#150;1757). Ruddiman responded with only marginally less scurrilous attacks on Man in <span class="italic">Anticrisis</span> (1754) and <span class="italic">Audi alteram partem</span> (1756).<br>
<br>Man died in October 1761, bequeathing &pound;60 to his relations and &pound;95 to the hospital of which he was master. His own edition of Buchanan's <span class="italic">Rerum Scoticarum historia</span> was published in 1762 and proved to be textually inferior to Ruddiman's. It was said that Man &#145;had from nature a vigorous intellect, and a peevish temper, with a small stature, and a mean look&#146;  (Chalmers, 248).<br>
