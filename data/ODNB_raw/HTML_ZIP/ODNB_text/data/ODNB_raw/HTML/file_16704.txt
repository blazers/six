<span class="headword">Lindsay,  John</span>, fifth Lord Lindsay of the Byres  (<em>d.</em> 1563), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of John, master of Lindsay (styled Sir John Lindsay of Pitcruvie), and Elizabeth Lundie, eldest daughter of Sir John Lundie of Balgonie. He had a charter in liferent from his grandfather Patrick, fourth Lord Lindsay, to the lordship and barony of Byres on 30 March 1524, and on 8 March 1526 was served heir to his father, who had died the previous year. On the death of his grandfather shortly afterwards, John was entered fifth Lord Lindsay of the Byres. In addition to the lands and title, he inherited the sheriffship of Fife, granted to his grandfather by parliament in July 1525. He married Helen, second daughter of John Stewart, second earl of Atholl, and they had ten children&#151;three sons and seven daughters, their eldest child being born in 1521.<br>
<br>In September 1526 Lord Lindsay was among those lords who attempted to rescue the young King James V from the Douglases. As a result he found himself imprisoned and his goods forfeited and gifted to Archibald Douglas. When King James escaped in 1528 Lord Lindsay was among those whom he summoned to support him as he established his personal rule.<br>
<br>In June 1529, following allegations that he had been negligent and abusive in the exercise of the office, Lindsay lost his position as sheriff of Fife to the fourth earl of Rothes. In June 1538 King James considered reappointing Lindsay and even drew up a letter to that effect, but it was never acted on, and in 1540 Rothes and his heirs were confirmed in the office. Lindsay resented the loss, which for some time remained a bone of contention between his family and the Leslies. When the master of Rothes was forfeited in 1563, Queen Mary reinstated Lindsay in the sheriffship. The dispute was finally settled in 1573, when the sixth Lord Lindsay was bought out by the fifth earl of Rothes.<br>
<br>Lindsay was made an extraordinary lord of session in 1532, and in 1540 sat on the assizes that tried and condemned Sir James Hamilton of Finnart for treason, and Sir John Borthwick for heresy. He may have hoped that service on these assizes would help him to recover the sheriffship of Fife.<br>
<br>Pitscottie reports that Lindsay was present at the death of James V at Falkland on 14 December 1542. On account of his presumed neutrality between the competing factions, Lindsay was appointed one of the custodians of the infant Queen Mary. However, the English ambassador Sir Ralph Sadler recorded that Lindsay would gladly have left the queen's household for the party of the earl of Arran, the governor of Scotland, in August 1543, but that the queen mother, Mary of Guise, halted the removal of his baggage in order to stay his departure. He was one of the commanders of the Scottish army which defeated the English at Ancrum Moor on 27 February 1545, and about that time was acting as curator to David Lindsay, master and later tenth earl of Crawford (the so-called &#145;wicked master's&#146; son).<br>
<br>In June 1545 Lord Lindsay sat with the privy council. He served regularly until May 1547, but then his attendance ended abruptly, and his career in public life seems to have ceased. Perhaps because he &#145;favoured religious reform from an early date&#146;  (Lord Lindsay, 1.267), he found it safer to maintain a low profile. His daughter Isobel had married Norman Leslie, master of Rothes, in 1541, and the latter's association with other known advocates of protestantism, not to mention his part in the murder of Cardinal David Beaton in 1546, may have brought Lindsay under suspicion at court.<br>
<br>Although no longer active in public life, Lindsay continued to take part in litigation, pursuing his adversaries and ensuring the maintenance of his children. By June 1559 he was described as being &#145;a very aged man&#146;  (Lord Lindsay, 1.269), but despite his age it was he who negotiated a compromise between the regent, as Mary of Guise now was, and the lords of the congregation, which averted a pitched battle at Cupar Muir.<br>
<br>Lindsay was present at the Reformation Parliament in August 1560 and gave his approval to the change of religion. A sympathetic eyewitness, who described him as &#145;as grave and goodly a man as ever I sawe&#146;, recorded his speech:<blockquote>I have lyved maynie yeres, I am the eldest in thys compagnie of my sorte, nowe that yt hathe pleased God to lett me see thys daye wher so maynie nobles and other have allowed so worthie a work, I will say with Simion, <i>Nunc dimittis</i>. (<span class="italic">CSP Scot. ser.</span>, <i>1509&#150;89</i>, 467)</blockquote>Lindsay also served as a lord of the articles, but although Knox claims that the fifth lord was present to subscribe the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> in January 1561, he does not appear among the signatories.<br>
<br>Lord Lindsay's last public act, early in 1562, was to sign a letter to Queen Elizabeth requesting safe passage through England for Lord James Stewart, going to meet his half-sister Queen Mary in France. Randolph noted in a letter to Cecil of 21 December 1563 that Lord Lindsay had died within the last four days, while the precept of <i>clare constat</i> recognizing his eldest son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16712/', "Patrick Lindsay")</script> as his father's heir, dated 13 March 1564, records that the fifth lord had died three months previously. He is reported to have died at Struthers in Fife. His widow lived until May 1577.<br>
