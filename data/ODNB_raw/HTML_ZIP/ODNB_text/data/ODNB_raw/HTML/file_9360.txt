<span class="headword">Ferrers,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1579), <span class="occ">courtier and poet</span>, was born about 1510 in St Albans, the first son of Thomas Ferrers of St Albans and his wife, Alice, the daughter of John Cockworthy of Cockworthy, Devon. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 22 November 1534; he was a frequent litigant, and praised by John Leland for his oratory at the bar, yet he is not known to have followed a legal career.<br>
<br>Ferrers's literary interests were initially legal and antiquarian. About 1533 he seems to have been responsible for the editing and translation of <span class="italic">The Great Boke of Statutes</span> covering the period from the first year of Edward III's reign to the twenty-fifth of Henry VIII's: the work was reprinted in an updated edition about 1542. His translation of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and other statutes was printed in 1534 and reprinted in a revised form about 1541 and again in 1542. He may be the George Ferras and the Mr. Ferrares who supplied Leland with information about the poet John Gower and a judge of the same name in the time of Edward II.<br>
<br>By 1538 Ferrers had become, with Thomas Chaloner, a servant of Thomas Cromwell; the following year he attended the reception of Anne of Cleves, and by 10 December 1541 he had married Elizabeth, the widow of his friend Humphrey Bourchier of Markyate, Hertfordshire. On Cromwell's fall in 1540 Ferrers was taken into the king's service, and from at least 1542 to 1547 he was a page of the chamber; in 1544 he attended Henry VIII in France. The king remembered him in his will. Ferrers was member of parliament for Plymouth in 1542 and 1545 and for Cirencester in 1547. He may have owed his first parliamentary seat at Plymouth to Sir John Russell, Baron Russell, and later first earl of Bedford: Ferrers accepted a satin doublet worth 24<i>s</i>. in lieu of wages. Thomas Seymour, the lord admiral, probably arranged his return for Cirencester, perhaps with the help of Thomas Sternhold.<br>
<br>The most notable episode in Ferrers's political career was his arrest for a debt of about 200 marks while on his way to the House of Commons in 1542. He was placed in the Counter in Bread Street and the serjeant-at-arms was able to secure his release only on a second visit. The man to whom he owed the debt, Weldon, with the city sheriffs Rowland Hill and Henry Suckley, and others, were summoned to appear before the house on 28 March 1542 to answer charges of breach of privilege: they were committed to the Tower for two days. The matter was referred to the privy council and the king claimed privilege for his own but also for his servants' attendance upon the business of parliament: the affair, which established the immunity of members of the House of Commons from civil arrest during session and the right of the Commons to release members arrested in this way, became known as Ferrers's case.<br>
<br>In 1546 Ferrers married Jane, the daughter of John Southcote of St Albans, with whom he had a son, Julius. On 29 July 1548 he received the extensive lands of Markyate Priory once held under lease by his first wife's late husband. He acted as a commissioner for transport in the Scottish campaign of 1547, and according to one contemporary witness was instrumental in the suffocation of some Scots who were hiding in a cave near Leith. In the campaign he was described as &#145;a gentleman of my lord Protectors&#146;  (W. Patten, <span class="italic">The Late Expedicion in Scotlande</span>, 1548, sig. D5<i>r</i>); nevertheless, he survived Somerset's fall in October 1549 and execution in January 1552. The king gave him a manuscript copy of the account of the 1547 expedition to Scotland written by Jean, le sieur Berteville, which Ferrers annotated and inscribed &#145;Liber Georgij Ferrers ex dono Regis Edouardi&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Cleopatra A. XI). It was printed for the Bannatyne Club in 1825.<br>
<br>Ferrers served as a justice of the peace for Hertfordshire from 1547 to 1554, as MP for Barnstaple, and then, through the influence of Sir Thomas Knyvett, as the member for Brackley in 1554&#150;5. The decision to appoint Ferrers&#151;hitherto known as a lawyer, courtier, MP, and servant of Somerset&#151;to preside over the Christmas festivities of 1551&#150;2 at Greenwich, which John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, in part intended to divert attention from the fall of Somerset, has not been convincingly explained. Nevertheless, Ferrers is reported by Grafton to have eclipsed the efforts of his predecessors:<blockquote>in shew of sundry sightes and devises of rare invention, and in act of divers enterludes and matters of pastime, played by persons, as not onely satisfied the common sorte, but also were very well liked and allowed by the counsayle and other of skill in the like pastimes. (Anglo, 303)</blockquote>The nature of the entertainments can be only partially reconstructed, but some important material relating to their preparation survives among the revels accounts in the Loseley manuscripts (now in the Folger Shakespeare Library) and in other documents. The master of the revels, Sir Thomas Cawarden (who, like Ferrers, had been a page of the chamber to Henry VIII), was told by Northumberland of Ferrers's appointment as lord of misrule and instructed to assist him promptly. Further correspondence relates to the provision of garments and furnishings for the devices. The entertainments, especially the visit to the city of London, were clearly of great importance to the authorities, and Cawarden had to be pushed into making them as spectacular as possible: the visit &#145;was not of our device&#146;, Ferrers told him, &#145;but of the Counseills appoyntement&#146;  (Anglo, 305). The success of the events can be judged by an entry in the acts of the privy council recording a payment of &pound;50 from Northumberland to Ferrers. The whole entertainment cost around &pound;500.<br>
<br>Ferrers presented himself at court by coming &#145;oute of the mone&#146;  (Anglo, 306), and his entourage was extensive. There was a play on Christmas day; on 2 January 1552 the lord of misrule was involved in a &#145;dronken Maske&#146;  (ibid.), and on the next evening took part in a mock midsummer-night revel, which probably included jousting on horseback. The visit to the city took place on 4 January, when Ferrers was accompanied by a great number of young knights, many on horses, and all wearing yellow and green baldricks around their necks: among his attendants were &#145;Counseilloures&#146;  (ibid., 305), among them Sir Robert Stafford and Thomas Wyndham. They landed at Tower wharf and proceeded by way of Tower Hill to a large scaffold by the cross at Cheapside. The lord was accompanied by music and morris dancers, as well as a guard of a hundred men in red and white. At the scaffold the lord of misrule's office and progeny were proclaimed, wine was distributed, and Ferrers rode to the lord mayor, with whom he had dinner: later they visited the lord treasurer at the Austin Friars, went to Bishopsgate, and returned to Greenwich from Tower wharf. The revels accounts reveal that the entertainment involved gaolers, manacles, locks, stocks, a pillory, a gibbet, an executioner's axe and block, and other items for imprisonment and punishment. This was no doubt all related to the execution of the duke of Somerset, which took place on Tower Hill on 22 January. After a play or interlude performed at Epiphany (6 January) there was a dialogue, <span class="italic">Youth and Riches</span>, which may have been by Ferrers's friend Thomas Chaloner, with whom he collaborated on <span class="italic">A Mirror for Magistrates</span>; the dialogue was followed by barriers, masques for men and women, and a banquet.<br>
<br>Ferrers's role as lord of misrule in the entertainments and in the visit to the city appears to be without precedent, and was sufficiently successful for him to be appointed to the position again the following year. This time he intended to come &#145;oute of a place caulled <i>vastum vacuum</i>&#146;  (Anglo, 309), where he was supposed to have been since last year, in a blue costume. On Christmas day an ambassador and interpreter would prepare the king for his arrival with his even more exotic entourage on the next day by ship at Greenwich. Again there was jousting and a mock midsummer show on new year's day and a visit to the city on 4 January: it reprised the theme of imprisonment and execution. Over the holidays there were various masques, including one of &#145;covetus men with longe noses&#146; and of &#145;women of Diana hunting&#146;  (ibid., 311). On twelfth night there was a triumph of Cupid, Venus, and Mars, devised by Sir George Howard, master of the henchmen in the royal household, whose realization seems to have been left to Ferrers. A list of those involved in the masque includes &#145;Ydelnes&#146; and &#145;Dalyance&#146;, &#145;two Ladies straungely attyred&#146;, and &#145;The herault cuoeur ardant&#146; among the classical roles: the show also involved two dozen tennis balls  (Anglo, 313).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Beware the Cat</span> (1570) William Baldwin refers to &#145;certain interludes, which for the King's recreation we had devised and were in learning&#146;. These almost certainly relate to the revels of this Christmas, and included a &#145;play of Aesop's Crow&#146; which the king's players were learning and which Baldwin did not like  (W. Baldwin, <span class="italic">Beware the Cat</span>, ed. W. A. Ringler jun. and M. Flachmann, 1988, 5). Baldwin and John Heywood wrote plays for Candlemas (2 February) and Shrovetide (14 February), but what part, if any, Ferrers had in them is not known: they were anyway postponed on account of the king's illness. Despite this, Ferrers was rewarded with an estate at Flamstead for his activities over the Christmas of 1552&#150;3 and reappointed by Mary for the following Christmas of 1553&#150;4. Later that year he was rewarded with &pound;100 for his loyalty to the crown during Wyatt's rebellion.<br>
<br>In spring and early summer 1555 Ferrers, with John Prideaux, accused John Dee and his associates, including Sir Thomas Benger, auditor to Princess Elizabeth and a future master of the revels, of conjuring, casting nativities, plotting on behalf of Elizabeth against the king and queen, and bewitching Ferrers's children. On or about 26 May 1555 Dee was held under arrest at Hampton Court, the week before Elizabeth was taken there from Woodstock; subsequently he and his co-conspirators were imprisoned. Ferrers went on to seek &#145;thapprehension of oone Stanney&#146;, but on 4 June the privy council in turn sought information concerning Ferrers's own whereabouts and ordered that, if not found, he should be sought &#145;into the counties of Oxon, Stafford, Warwick and Wigorn&#146;  (L. B. Campbell, &#145;Humphrey duke of Gloucester&#146;, <span class="italic">Huntington Library Bulletin</span>, 5, 1934, 147).<br>
<br>After this episode Ferrers largely disappears from sight; he held no crown office under Queen Elizabeth and was not restored to the commission for the peace. He was appointed escheator for Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire in 1562&#150;3 and for Essex and Hertfordshire in 1566&#150;7.<br>
<br>William Baldwin was instrumental in the creation of Ferrers's largest surviving literary work, his contributions to <span class="italic">A Mirror for Magistrates</span>, in which he was also associated with Thomas Chaloner and Thomas Phaer. Ferrers probably wrote several of his pieces for the suppressed edition of about 1554 which survives only in fragments. When the work was published again in 1559 it included his tragedies of Tresilian and Thomas of Woodstock, but those of Elianor Cobham, Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and Edmund, duke of Somerset, were suppressed. The last of these was printed in the edition of 1563, for which Ferrers also brought, among other tragedies, Churchyard's about Jane Shore, written during the reign of Edward VI. The poems about Elianor Cobham and Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, were not printed until 1578. In C. S. Lewis's judgement, &#145;Ferrers is no poet but he is of curious interest as a metrist&#146;  (C. S. Lewis, <span class="italic">English Literature in the Sixteenth Century Excluding Drama</span>, 1954, 241).<br>
<br>Little is known of Ferrers's later literary work. According to John Stow, he was the author of the part of Grafton's chronicle (1568&#150;9) recording the events of the reign of Queen Mary: Grafton denied this, but Stow insisted it was the case. In his will, made in August 1560, Thomas Phaer appointed Ferrers to choose passages of scripture for his tomb in Cilgerran church, Pembrokeshire. Ferrers contributed verses to the earl of Leicester's Kenilworth entertainment of 1575 for Queen Elizabeth: he wrote a speech by the Lady of the Lake and verses for the device of her delivery in which his contribution was probably another speech by her.<br>
<br>In 1569 Ferrers married, thirdly, Margaret Preston, a widow of St Albans, with whom he had at least three sons and two daughters. In 1571 he was returned as MP for St Albans. He supported the claim to the succession of Mary, Queen of Scots, and corresponded with John Lesley, bishop of Ross, who believed he had written a Latin work on her claim. He was not popular with his neighbours and tenants, and died intestate at Flamstead, Hertfordshire, where he was buried on 11 January 1579. He appears to have kept the protestant faith throughout most of his life.<br>
<br>Describing the poets of the reign of Edward VI, George Puttenham called Ferrers &#145;the principall man in this profession&#146;, and comparing him with his contemporaries said he was &#145;a man of no lesse mirth &amp; felicitie &hellip; but of much more skil, &amp; magnificence in his meeter&#146;. Puttenham went on to say that he &#145;wrate for the most part to the stage, in Tragedie and sometimes in Comedie or Enterlude, wherein he gave the king so much good recreation, as he had thereby many good rewardes&#146;. Later on he praises Buckhurst and Ferrers as writers of tragedy &#145;for such doings as I have sene of theirs do deserve the hyest price&#146;  (Puttenham, <span class="italic">The Arte of English Poesie</span>, ed. G. D. Willcock and A. Walker, 1936, 60, 63). Unfortunately, on both occasions Puttenham refers to Ferrers as &#145;<i>Edward Ferrys</i>&#146;, a confusion perpetuated by Francis Meres in his <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> and repeated by later historians until it was ended by Sidney Lee in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
