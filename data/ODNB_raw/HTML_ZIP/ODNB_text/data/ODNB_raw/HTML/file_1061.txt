<span class="headword">Baillie, Lady  Grisell</span>  (1665&#150;1746), <span class="occ">heroine and business woman</span>, was born on 25 December 1665 at Redbraes Castle, Berwickshire, the eldest survivor of the eighteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14150/', "Sir Patrick Hume (or Home) of Polwarth, later first earl of Marchmont (1641&#150;1724)")</script>, and Grisell Kerr (<i>d</i>. 1703), daughter of Sir Thomas Kerr of Cavers. The daughter of staunch Presbyterians, she occupies a prominent place in the martyrology of the covenanting movement. Her father's opposition to Lauderdale's policies led to his imprisonment in the 1670s; his close friend Robert Baillie of Jerviswood suffered similar treatment. In 1676 the young Grisell was entrusted by her father with the delivery of a letter to Baillie, at that time in custody in Edinburgh. She not only gained admittance to his cell, but also smuggled out a message. It was probably on this occasion, too, that she met the prisoner's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64094/', "George Baillie (1664&#150;1738)")</script>, whom she was later to marry.<br>
<br>Grisell had shown intelligence, courage, and initiative, and thereafter her parents placed increasing reliance on her. In the early 1680s both Robert Baillie and Hume were caught up in the aftermath of the Rye House plot. Baillie was hanged for treason; Hume, fearing similar treatment, concealed himself in the family vault at Polwarth church. For a month Grisell kept him supplied with food and drink, putting food from her own plate at dinner into her lap in case the servants should suspect. When it was thought best to move Sir Patrick's place of concealment, it was Grisell who, with the assistance of a trusted servant, excavated a hiding place beneath the family house. It was actions of this sort that led Henry Grey Graham to bracket Grisell Baillie with Flora Macdonald in his pantheon of Scottish heroines.<br>
<br>Hume escaped to the continent and eventually, after a return to Scotland in the abortive Argyll rebellion, made his way to Utrecht, whence he sent for his ailing wife and ten surviving children. In the Netherlands Grisell displayed her burgeoning managerial abilities in organizing a large household bereft of servants except for &#145;a little girl to wash the dishes&#146; and frequented by &eacute;migr&eacute; Scots (including George Baillie) and other &#145;well-wishers to the Revolution&#146;  (Murray, 46&#150;7). When the revolution came in 1688, Hume accompanied William of Orange's expedition; its success assured his family's prosperity. Grisell, who went over to England with the Princess Mary, was offered the post of maid of honour. However, this &#145;well made, clever &hellip; very handsome&#146; person, with &#145;life and sweetness in her eyes &hellip; and great delicacy in all her features&#146;, with chestnut hair and &#145;the finest complexion&#146;  (ibid., 56), preferred to return home to Scotland and to marry, on 17 September 1691, her childhood love, George Baillie, now restored to the Jerviswood estates.<br>
<br>It was a long and happy marriage. Three children were born: a son, who died in infancy, and two daughters, Grisell (1692&#150;1759), who married Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope, and Rachel (1696&#150;1773), who married Charles, Lord Binning. George Baillie followed a successful career, becoming a lord of the Treasury in 1717. His wife provided shrewd political assistance to him and to her father, lobbying for support on their behalf and keeping them apprised of the situation in Scotland when they were at court. The business skills acquired in Utrecht were now applied in a broader context. George Baillie gave her a free hand; the only question he ever asked was &#145;if his debt was paid&#146;  (Murray, 72). On hearing of the selection of a certain politician, of whom he disapproved, for a Treasury post, he suggested to the earl of Roxburghe, perhaps only half in jest, that the government should rather have &#145;put my Lady there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 109). As her father aged, Grisell took over the management of his estates, once spending two months, working from five in the morning to twelve at night, sorting out the accounts. She also managed her brother's affairs while he was abroad and supervised the education of his children and of her own grandchildren, living some years at Oxford for the purpose.<br>
<br>Grisell's <span class="italic">Household Book</span> shows her hard at work. Servants were either diligent or dismissed; eight cooks came and went in 1715. She did not bear incompetence patiently, as when she noted the price paid for young trees by her gardener, &#145;which was a perfit cheat&#146;  (<span class="italic">Household Book</span>, 253). When the family removed temporarily to Italy for the sake of Lord Binning's health, Grisell learned Italian, the better to bargain with the tradespeople. As the inscription on her monument noted, &#145;unwearied application&#146; and &#145;happy economy&#146; went hand in hand in her management of affairs; she amassed an immense fortune. In her rare leisure moments she wrote poems and songs; the most famous is &#145;Werena my heart licht I wad dee&#146;.<br>
<br>&#145;Full of years and of good works&#146;  (monument), Grisell died in London on 6 December 1746, after a brief illness. On her deathbed she had asked for the last chapter of <span class="roman">Proverbs</span> to be read to her. It was an accurate description of this remarkable woman, who most certainly had never eaten &#145;the bread of idleness&#146;  (<span class="roman">Proverbs</span> 31: 27) and whose worth was indeed &#145;above rubies&#146;  (ibid., 31: 10). According to her own instructions she was buried (on 25 December 1746) beside her husband at Mellerstain, whose modest buildings were soon to be enlarged by the hand of Robert Adam and which came into the possession of her descendants the earls of Haddington.<br>
