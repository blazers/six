<span class="headword">Tichborne,  Robert</span>, appointed Lord Tichburne under the protectorate  (1610/11&#150;1682), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was born in London, the eldest son of Robert Tichborne (<i>d</i>. 1644/5) of St Michael-le-Querne, London, and Cowden, Kent, a gentleman free of the Skinners' Company, and his wife, Joan, daughter of Thomas Banks, gentleman, a London merchant. He was married twice: first by licence dated 27 April 1638, when aged twenty-seven, to Mary Priest (<i>b</i>. 1614); they had two sons. His second wife was Anne, eldest daughter of William Johnson of Ingham, Norfolk, gentleman; they had two more children.<br>
<br>Tichborne followed his father into the Skinners' Company, from apprentice in 1631 to his freedom in 1637, and on to common council in 1643, as a member for Farringdon Within. Having joined the Honourable Artillery Company in 1636, by 1642 he was also serving as a captain in the Yellow regiment of the London trained bands. Already well established as a wealthy Cheapside linen draper, he benefited substantially from his father's will. On the outbreak of civil war he was quick to display a militant parliamentarianism in opposition to peace campaigners in the capital and in 1643 he became lieutenant-colonel of a regiment of London auxiliaries. His militancy earned him notoriety in royalist circles as one of seven rebellious citizens believed to be chiefly responsible for London's disaffection from the king. In the spring of 1643 he joined other City militants on a London subcommittee established at Salters' Hall to raise a volunteer citizens' army. This brought him into close contact with other emerging leaders of political Independency in the City as well as a future Leveller leader, William Walwyn. When the City decided to reassert its control over the subcommittee Tichborne was one of seven Salters' Hall nominees added to the London militia committee in July 1643 as a conciliatory gesture. In the following September he saw service with his militia regiment at the first battle of Newbury.<br>
<br>By the closing stages of the war Tichborne was busy establishing himself as a leader of political Independency in the City. He spoke out in common council against presbyterian attacks on the anticlericalism of the October 1645 ordinance appointing lay triers; led protest against the political presbyterian City remonstrance of May 1646; and, the next month, was a principal supporter of the London Independent petition to the Commons. City presbyterians retaliated during the attempted counter-revolution of 1647, when Tichborne and other leading Independents were purged from the militia committee, only to be subsequently restored to it after the army's intervention. When the latter occupied London in August, Fairfax paid tribute to Tichborne's political reliability by appointing him lieutenant of the Tower and colonel of a new regiment to guard it. He subsequently participated in both the Putney and Whitehall debates of 1647&#150;8 within the council of officers, adopting a relatively radical stance on the question of the power of the king and Lords to veto legislation and that of the civil magistrate over religion, but stopping short of an endorsement of the Leveller's platform. After the second civil war, however, he took part in the Nag's Head tavern discussions held between leading City Independents and Levellers and was a member of the committee of sixteen which drew up the second <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>.<br>
<br>Tichborne was an active supporter of the king's trial and execution, attending all but three of the high court's seventeen meetings and signing the death warrant. He also helped organize a common council petition in mid-January 1649, calling for the execution of justice upon Charles and others responsible for the recent bloodshed [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. The ensuing political transformation in London saw Tichborne elected alderman for Farringdon Within in July 1649 and a London sheriff and master of the Skinners' Company in 1650. His religious Independency had already brought him into close acquaintance with other prominent radicals who similarly gained commanding positions in the City after 1649. A member of George Cockayn's influential Independent congregation at St Pancras, Soper Lane, he was also on friendly terms with members of John Goodwin's church in Coleman Street. He wrote two lengthy works of spiritual devotion in early 1649, <span class="italic">A Cluster of Canaan's Grapes</span> and <span class="italic">The Rest of Faith</span> (dedicated to Fairfax and Cromwell respectively), and established a lectureship in St Olave, Silver Street.<br>
<br>Appointments to major positions of responsibility followed from 1649 onwards, including membership of the indemnity committee, probate judge, and commissioner of customs, a post he was removed from in 1656 amid suspicions of fraud. In addition Tichborne was named a commissioner to the high courts of justice of 1650 and 1654 and, in 1651&#150;2, was one of eight commissioners sent to Scotland to prepare for its union with England. In 1653 he was appointed to the nominated assembly, becoming one of its most active MPs, and was a member of the two councils of state elected by it. His politics now moved in a more moderate direction: he clashed with radicals over proposals for the abolition of tithes and lay patronage and was accused of having helped bring the assembly to its early end. He enjoyed further favour under the protectorate and in 1656 was elected lord mayor of London and knighted by Cromwell. A contemporary print of Tichborne on horseback wearing his full mayoral regalia is to be found in the Guildhall Library. He was made a member of the new upper house in 1657, taking his seat as Lord Tichburne; other distinctions included a directorship of the East India Company and, in 1658, appointment to the presidency of the Honourable Artillery Company. The restoration of the Rump in 1659 did not bring immediate political eclipse; this was to happen finally as a result of his brief service on the committee of safety set up by the army when it again interrupted parliament in October.<br>
<br>At the Restoration he surrendered in obedience to the proclamation of 16 June and was tried for regicide in October 1660. Despite pleas of ignorance and repentance, he was formally sentenced to death, yet his life was spared as a result of the combined benefits of the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> and reports that he had previously saved some royalists from execution. He spent the rest of his days in prison, although his wife and children were permitted to live with him during his imprisonment in Dover Castle in 1664&#150;74. He died in the Tower on 6 July 1682 and was subsequently buried with the utmost privacy in Mercers' Chapel; he was survived by his second wife, Anne. Administration of the little that was left of his estate was granted to his eldest son, John, in September 1682.<br>
