<span class="headword">Windus,  William Lindsay</span>  (1822&#150;1907), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Liverpool on 8 July 1822, the grandson of William Windus, vicar of Halsall, near Ormskirk, and the son of John Windus and Agnes Meek, a Scotswoman. He is said to have received his early education at Mr MacMorran's private school in Liverpool. When he was about sixteen he received some lessons from William Daniels, who painted his stepfather's portrait. He studied at the Liverpool Academy and attended a life class run by a brother of John Rogers Herbert; the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, holds several life studies dating from the early 1840s. Among his earliest pictures were <span class="italic">The Black Boy</span> (1844) and a self-portrait (both Walker Art Gallery); other early works are at the Williamson Art Gallery, Birkenhead. Windus painted mainly romantic historical paintings or illustrations of the works of Sir Walter Scott and Shakespeare, with religious or moralistic overtones. His first exhibited work, <span class="italic">Falstaff Acting King Henry IV</span>, was shown at the Liverpool Academy in 1845.<br>
<br>In 1847 Windus was elected an associate of the Liverpool Academy, and in 1848 he became a full member. He exhibited there until 1864, but was partially responsible for its demise in 1867. As a member of the Liverpool Academy he initiated the invitation to the Pre-Raphaelites to exhibit their works in Liverpool in the 1850s. They won successive annual prizes (1851&#150;3 and 1856&#150;7), provoking an outcry from other artists, the press, and the public, and precipitating a split into rival factions, financial loss, and eventual collapse. Windus became acquainted with the Pre-Raphaelites in 1850 when he visited London to study new trends in painting at the suggestion of John Miller, an art collector and one of his chief patrons. He was particularly influenced by Millais's <span class="italic">Christ in the House of his Parents</span> (&#145;The Carpenter's Shop&#146;; 1849&#150;50; Tate collection), exhibited that year at the Royal Academy. Windus was a member of the Pre-Raphaelites' short-lived Hogarth Club in London and exhibited with them in 1857.<br>
<br>In 1856 Windus exhibited <span class="italic">Burd Helen</span> (1855&#150;6; Walker Art Gallery) at the Royal Academy. It was his first painting with a landscape background. The work, though &#145;skied&#146;, attracted the attention of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who thought it the &#145;finest thing of all in the place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</span>, 187), and &#145;forced Ruskin to go with him in a cab instanter because he had not noticed it in his pamphlet &amp; extorted the promise of a postscrip [<i>sic</i>] on its behalf&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Ford Madox Brown</span>, 173). In the postscript to his 1856 <span class="italic">Academy Notes</span>, Ruskin called it &#145;the second picture of the year; its aim being higher, and its reserved strength greater than those of any other work except [Millais's] &#147;<span class="roman">Autumn Leaves</span>&#148;&#146;. He continued: &#145;the work is thoughtful and intense to the highest degree&#146; and &#145;of the grandest imaginative power&#146;, and cited only &#145;quite minor defects&#146; in the horse's bearing and pebbles in the water  (Ruskin, 86&#150;7). In a letter to the Edinburgh <span class="italic">Witness</span> on 27 March 1858, he wrote: &#145;The worst Pre-Raphaelite picture has something <i>in</i> it; and the great ones, such as Windus's &#147;<span class="italic">Burd Helen</span>&#148;, will hold their own with the most noble pictures of all time&#146;  (ibid., 330). On 30 July 1856 Windus wrote to Rossetti in &#145;the knowledge of the kindness you have done me&#146;, asking him to approve a drawing on wood of <span class="italic">Burd Helen</span> that was to be engraved for the <span class="italic">National Magazine</span>. Rossetti apparently did, for Windus thanked him on 3 August, adding: &#145;I assure you that you and Mr. Ruskin were the two persons in the world whose approbation I most ardently wished and scarcely dared to hope for&#146;  (Rossetti, 138).<br>
<br>Windus's other major Pre-Raphaelite work, <span class="italic">Too Late</span> (1857&#150;8; Tate collection), was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1859. He regarded this painting as his masterpiece, but Ruskin considered it unfinished and condemned it, saying, &#145;Something wrong here; either the painter has been ill, or his picture has been sent in to the Academy in a hurry; &hellip; There is great grandeur in the work; but it cannot for a moment be compared with &#147;<span class="roman">Burd Helen</span>&#148;&#146;  (Ruskin, 233&#150;4). He acknowledged in a postscript that he may have hurt &#145;the artist's feelings deeply, just when all discouragement is most dangerous to him&#146; and assured him of his &#145;conviction that, with returning strength, he may one day take highest rank among masters of expression&#146;  (ibid., 239). Ruskin's criticism had a devastating effect on Windus, who was prone to depression, and he never submitted another work to the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>In 1858 Windus married a sister of Robert Tonge, a fellow artist. A son, Robert, was the subject of <span class="italic">Study of a Dead Child, the Artist's Son</span> (1860; Tate collection). On 2 August 1862 his wife died, after a long illness, leaving a fifteen-month-old daughter. The deaths, the strain on Windus's health and nerves, and Ruskin's criticism are the traditional explanations why Windus gave up painting, but there is also a domestic explanation alluded to by William Michael Rossetti:<blockquote>he promised his late wife that he would never part from their daughter, which prevents his entering into any arrangement that would allow of his pursuing his profession advantageously. He has lost all power of setting to work, or of resolving to do so; yet whenever he does attempt anything he finds he paints better than ever. (Ruskin, 87)</blockquote>He was fortunate to have an independent income, which enabled him to give up painting except for pleasure and to leave Liverpool with his daughter to live quietly with his wife's parents at Walton-le-Dale, near Preston.<br>
<br>During the early 1860s Windus spent summers with the artist Daniel Alexander Williamson, painting in the Lake District, and while there probably painted <span class="italic">The Baa Lamb: View on a Tributary of the River Duddon</span> (&#145;The Stray Lamb&#146;; <i>c</i>.1864; Walker Art Gallery). In 1862 he sent <span class="italic">The Outlaw</span> (1861; Manchester City Galleries) to the Liverpool Academy. These two paintings are in the Pre-Raphaelite style, with the focus primarily on the landscape setting. In 1879 or 1880 Windus left Lancashire for London, and is said to have destroyed most of his sketches and studies. In 1888 Ford Madox Brown wrote, &#145;I saw him a few months ago at Hampstead, where he lives almost wholly by himself. He will not paint: he sometimes begins to do so in the morning, but he invariably rubs out his work in the evening&#146;  (&#145;Progress of art&#146;, 122). Windus lived in Hampstead for nearly twenty years before moving to Denmark Hill, where he died, at 13 Champion Park, on 9 October 1907.<br>
<br>Windus was practically forgotten until the spring exhibition of the New English Art Club of 1896, which included three watercolours by him: <span class="italic">The Flight of Henry VI from Towton</span> (<i>c</i>.1860&#150;70; Tate collection), <span class="italic">The Second Duchess</span> (before 1866; Tate collection), and <span class="italic">A Roman Patrician, AD 60</span> (<i>c</i>.1865&#150;86; Walker Art Gallery); two untraced paintings were exhibited in 1899. They excited great interest among artists and connoisseurs. His work, which is relatively scarce, was greatly valued as that of one of Liverpool's most poetical and imaginative figure painters. The year after his death forty-five of his pictures were exhibited at the Historical Exhibition of Liverpool Art at the Walker Art Gallery.<br>
