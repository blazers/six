<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Watson,  Thomas</span>  (1555/6&#150;1592), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, has been identified as the boy who entered Winchester College in 1567, aged eleven  (Eccles, <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 130). This Thomas Watson was born in the city of London parish of St Helen, Bishopsgate, according to the school admissions register. It is not known who his parents were; several Watson families lived in London at the time.<h2>
<a name="Youthandtravel"></a>Youth and travel</h2>After acquiring a reliable facility in classical languages and literature, Watson seems to have attended Oxford University briefly (without obtaining a degree) in the early 1570s. His friends at Oxford included the poets John Lyly and George Peele, the antiquarian William Camden, William Beale, a preacher of Westminster, and others who were about the university at that time. Wood says that he neglected his proper studies for &#145;poetry and romance&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 3.601), a habit continued during the next seven years while travelling in France and Italy; there, Watson says, although he was supposed to be studying law, he visited the camps of Apollo and the Muses whenever he could. He absorbed the culture and language of both countries thoroughly, making contact with poets, and writing and translating poetry; but neither this nor the French religious wars in which he was sometimes caught up prevented him achieving proficiency in civil and canon law, as he was pleased to advertise. Opportunities for travel were no doubt helped by his acquaintance with Sir Francis Walsingham, from whose Paris embassy he would have embarked on his long tour, and from where he seems finally to have left for England in August 1581, carrying official letters from the secretary to William Cecil. Four entries in the diary of the English College at Douai, and witness statements made in 1587  (Eccles, <span class="italic">Christopher Marlowe in London</span>, 128&#150;44, 151) may possibly indicate earlier journeys home. After Walsingham's death he expressed his gratitude to him for offering comfort in some unspecified sadness which affected him at this time.<br>
<br>Although still in his early twenties, Watson had translated Petrarch's <span class="italic">Canzoniere</span> into Latin and written two Latin poems (all these only surviving as excerpts in other of his works), and fashioned what was probably the first Latin translation available to the Tudor reader of Sophocles's <span class="italic">Antigone</span>, printed in London in the summer of 1581 by John Wolfe, who became his regular printer. The dedication (to Philip Howard, first earl of Arundel) provides information on Watson's travels, and the preparatory material includes support in verse from his Oxford friends, and encouragement from the German jurist Stefan Broellmann. The work itself establishes what became Watson's lifelong intention&#151;to inform and instruct as well as enlighten. A prologue presents the moral arguments, and added after Sophocles's text are original dramatic sections called &#145;pompae&#146; and &#145;themata&#146; which examine the issues further. This is an edition appropriate for acting in the university or the inns of court, and Camden's line &#145;tu pompis Latiis nostra theatra quatis&#146; (&#145;your Latin pomps make our audience tremble&#146;) suggests a previous staging. The work was much approved by Gabriel Harvey.<h2>
<a name="SettledinLondon"></a>Settled in London</h2>Back in London in 1581 Watson took up lodgings again in St Helen's. At this time English lyric poetry writing was quite impoverished, a fact emphasized by several later writers, and strong puritan factions attacked the activity; little was being published except anthologies. The two poets who had made genuine attempts to incorporate in their verse the lessons of the long traditions of Italian and French literature, Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, were dead long since, and the only significant lyric poet of recent times, George Gascoigne, was of a decidedly English inspiration.<br>
<br>Watson, however, was keen to present the fruits of his foreign experiences in concentrated form, and to the general reader (rather than to a limited group of &eacute;lite admirers). As a Latinist marching into the field of English lyric verse he was being bold and showed some apprehension, but he received much encouragement, this time from a literary coterie based around John Lyly in Holborne. <span class="italic">The <i>Hekatompathia</i>, or, Passionate Century of Love</span> was printed in the spring of 1582, and in dedicating it to Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford, who had already seen a manuscript (BL, Harley MS 3277), the author modestly apologizes for his temerity in offering English verse, for the &#145;trifling&#146; nature of its subject, and for his own lack of skill. It became his best-known and most quoted English work and Watson was hailed as a Petrarch who had brought the Muses to live in England, enriching his native tongue (as Harvey noted) and giving intellectual respectability to love poetry. Each &#145;sonnet&#146; (of eighteen lines) is provided with a heading which explains the nature of the poem, points out rhetorical devices, narrates mythological references (mainly from Homer, Ovid, and Propertius), and acknowledges, or quotes, literary sources (altogether some thirty-two classical authors and twenty-five from Renaissance Italy and France). Each poem confronts an aspect of a lover's suffering, and although Watson says it is merely imagined on his part, he shows considerable insight and humour, and some depth, and deals efficiently with metrical and structural aspects. In the opening protrepticon he imagines the volume's reception at the court, and several of the poems appear to be addressed to Elizabeth herself. The later poems examine feelings once &#145;love is past&#146;.<h2>
<a name="EarlyLatinworks"></a>Early Latin works</h2>Watson thought of himself primarily as a Latin writer, and his next three works were in this language. The first, a prose treatise, called in manuscript &#145;Artificios&aelig; memori&aelig; libellus&#146; (1583; BL, Sloane MS 3731) and in print <span class="italic">Compendium memoriae localis</span> (1585), is a simple exposition of the theory and practice of the classical art of memory training. Interest in the subject was current due to the presence in London of Giordano Bruno, a champion of the magical element in memory systems, and a contender in the controversy raging in the universities over the replacement of Aristotelian methods with those of the French philosopher Pierre Ramus (<i>d</i>. 1572). Watson intended his manuscript for Albert Lasko, a visiting prince of Poland and another hermeticist, who was specially invited to the reader's banquet in the Middle Temple hall, but it seems that he did not turn up for the event. So two years later the published <span class="italic">Compendium</span> was dedicated to Henry Noel, one of Elizabeth's gentleman pensioners and a close friend.<br>
<br>Watson's next work (and eventually his most famous) was a set of eleven Latin verse lamentations called <span class="italic">Amyntas</span> (1585), dedicated again to Noel, in which an Arcadian shepherd mourns the death of his companion, Phillis, on the banks of the Thames. There is much rustic sentiment and earthy nostalgia, but the laments become more intense as the eleven days progress, the final day culminating in the shepherd's suicide, the only way in which he can rejoin his lover. His corpse is metamorphosed into an amaranthus plant, and Amor (Cupid) gives it the property of staunching bleeding, an ironic twist since it was Cupid's arrow which first injured his heart. But fame did not come for this work until Abraham Fraunce's unacknowledged translation of it into &#145;high-witted&#146; English hexameters (1587), made for his patron, Mary Herbert, countess of Pembroke, as an offering of consolation on the death of her brother (Sir Philip Sidney). Later Fraunce published a different edition in which the translation (now acknowledged) was joined on to another, Tasso's <span class="italic">Aminta</span>, his &#145;Sylvia&#146; changing her name to Watson's &#145;Phillis&#146; to preserve continuity.<br>
<br>Last in this group is a translation (1586) of the fifth century Greek poem of Paris and Helen by Colluthus, which Watson made for Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland. That he may have been an intimate of the earl's group is suggested by the fact that he also dedicated to him a treatise on the collection and preservation of fresh water for domestic purposes (formerly a Petworth MS, now Harvard, Houghton English 707), translated from the French of Bernard Palissy, the Huguenot potter. Much work was being done on the gardens of Petworth House at this time.<h2>
<a name="Theatreandmusicallyrics"></a>Theatre and musical lyrics</h2>About 1587 Watson moved lodgings to Norton Folegate, in which year he is described as &#145;a man very well learned&#146; being &#145;late of St Helen's&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 53/79, 162&#150;3). The thrust of new theatrical activity was happening in these &#145;liberties&#146; outside Bishopsgate, and among the playwrights were Watson's friends Lyly and Peele, as well as the youngsters Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, and Robert Greene. Watson addressed a commendatory hexasticon to Greene in 1589, and in September of that year he intervened in a brawl in Hog Lane (now Curtain Road), Finsbury, between Marlowe and William Bradley, who was attacking Marlowe with sword and dagger, apparently over a money problem. Earlier Bradley had petitioned for an injunction against Watson and John Alleyn, an actor, to keep the peace. Watson suffered serious injury to his thigh before killing Bradley in self-defence; the trial gave a verdict of manslaughter and Watson was kept in Newgate prison until pardon the following February. Although no plays by Watson are extant, his employer William Cornwallis wrote later that devising &#145;twenty fictions and knaveryes in a play&#146; was his &#145;daily practyse and his living&#146;  (Hall, 256), and in <span class="italic">A Knight's Conjuring</span> (1607) Thomas Dekker imagines the actor John Bentley in heaven near Watson and Kyd, because &#145;he had bene a Player molded out of their pennes&#146;. There is also textual evidence to suggest that Watson may have written some speeches for the entertainment given to Elizabeth by Sir Edward Seymour in 1591.<br>
<br>Before his imprisonment Watson made the acquaintance of both William Byrd, the composer, and Thomas Este, his music printer, in 1589 writing a lyric for a vocal piece by Byrd, published on broadsides. This extolled the virtues of the Oxford divine John Case, who had recently been railing in print against the ill effects of the puritan ethic on music, church music particularly; Byrd had often suffered from such restricting invasions. Watson's introduction to Este had far-reaching consequences, for following on from the success of Este's production in 1588 of an anthology of (mostly) Italian madrigals with lyrics translated into English, the idea was conceived of Watson writing English lyrics to some newer Italian madrigals, so as to demonstrate more effectively that the madrigal form relied on the very instant interdependence of words and music. Watson had shown his sensitivity to music in earlier poems, and he perceived (with his eye set again on instruction) that as yet neither England's composers nor her poets had applied themselves to understanding the Italian method completely.<br>
<br>The result was <span class="italic">The first sett of Italian madrigalls Englished, not to the sense of the originall dittie, but after the affection of the noate</span> (1590), in which was printed the music of twenty-six madrigals in four, five, and six parts, mostly by Luca Marenzio, whose music was already a favourite with English singing-groups through illegally imported foreign prints and home-made copies (often without words), and the earlier anthology. Watson's lyrics show hardly any translations, the new content being determined by the flow of the melodies and harmonies, and by the overall spirit of the original. Byrd himself illustrated the method with two examples of his own.<br>
<br>The way in which the book for the &#145;medius&#146; part is collated suggests that at first there were to be only twenty-four madrigals, all in five parts, but that the death of Watson's mentor Sir Francis Walsingham in April 1590 necessitated a rearrangement to include several lyrics praising his life and regretting his death, set to the greater sonority of six vocal parts; included in these is also an account of his imagined astral meeting with his son-in-law, Sidney. This anthology and its predecessor soon involved native composers in active participation in madrigal writing, the first of the eventual large school being Thomas Morley in 1593.<h2>
<a name="LastworksandtheCornwallisaffair"></a>Last works and the Cornwallis affair</h2>Watson further marked the secretary of state's death with a pastoral eclogue in Latin, dedicated to Thomas Walsingham, Sir Francis's first cousin, of Scadbury Manor in Kent, whom (as he notes in the poem) Watson had known since their youthful days together in the Paris embassy (<span class="italic">Meliboeus Thomae Watsoni</span>, 1590). An English version soon followed (<span class="italic">An Eglogue upon the Death of &hellip; Sir Francis Walsingham</span>, 1590), dedicated to Lady Frances Sidney, the secretary of state's daughter, which Watson translated himself in order to avoid what happened to his earlier epic. The poem is in the form of a conversation (Latin, 445 lines; English, 426) between the poet and Thomas Walsingham in which they rehearse the virtues and achievements of Sir Francis (called Meliboeus, the title of the Latin version), invoke angry responses from the universe around (which here is still Ptolemy's), pity his abandoned country, and console the family. Watson seems to present himself as a sort of national laureate in this, for Elizabeth's sadness is also imagined, and her favourite poet, Spenser, is invoked to remind her of all those devoted state servants who are still in office.<br>
<br>From time to time Watson may have been used by Sir Francis Walsingham as a political agent; perhaps even his position with William Cornwallis, as tutor to the son, was organized so that he could be Walsingham's ears during the official inquiries into the recusancy of the father, Sir Thomas Cornwallis of Brome in Suffolk, who was under surveillance from 1587. It was about this time that Watson took up his duties at Fisher's Folly opposite St Botolph without Bishopsgate, which the Cornwallises had just taken over from the earl of Oxford; John, aged fifteen, was soon to enter the then openly Catholic Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>One of Watson's colleagues in the household was Thomas Swift, a Norwich-born musician, sheltered in the family since boyhood. Watson had married his older sister, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1564), at St Antholin, Budge Row, London, on 6 September 1585. About 1589 Swift conceived the notion that William Cornwallis had been &#145;miserable towards him&#146;, and, &#145;by the advice of the said Watson, whom he &hellip; confessed the plot-layer of this matter&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 97, fol. 29), he began a blackmail worthy of presentation at a nearby playhouse. The scheme was to lend ten gold angels to Cornwallis's fourteen-year-old daughter, Frances (not an unusual event, for Swift was &#145;in love&#146; with her, and it was a miser's house), in return for her signature to a document which promised repayment with interest on her wedding day. The signing was hurriedly effected before morning lessons in front of witnesses, but the document (drawn up by Swift's brother, the attorney Hugh Swift) actually concealed a contract to marry the musician. Watson doubtless thought that he would never dare use it, and attempted later to get it away from him; but use it he did on Frances's betrothal, setting a blackmail price. Cornwallis's fury at this calumny and his daughter's besmirchment knew no bounds, and as a relative of Burghley through his wife, he managed to get a hearing in the Star Chamber in 1593, at which (the late) Watson's involvement was exposed by John, Frances's honour restored, and Swift very severely punished.<br>
<br>Watson wrote two other significant works, both published posthumously. In the ambitious (and speedily written) 2000-line Latin pastoral <span class="italic">Amintae gaudia</span> (which Marlowe saw through the press in November 1592) he narrates the earlier relationship of his lovers, Phillis now alive and so virtuously addressed that it seems almost that she is the dedicatee, Mary Herbert. The epistolary form is derived from Propertius, there are several well-crafted erotic incidents of an Ovidian nature, and a long epyllion narrates the installation by the immortal gods of Sidney on his star. Also included is a description, based on Virgil, of the defeat of the Armada, and several episodes of an apparently autobiographical nature.<br>
<br>The second work, a sixty-sonnet sequence printed in 1593, was no doubt intended by its publisher to take advantage of the current fashion of sonnet sequences, many of which, though stimulated by the publication of <span class="italic">Astrophil and Stella</span> (1591), reflected Watson's direct style more than Sidney's subtleties. The author of <span class="italic">The Tears of Fancie</span> is shown only by the initials T. W., but Watson is a strong candidate, for the poems exhibit characteristics of his style (but less Petrarchan) and cover similar amatory concerns, and there is a final line to sonnet 59 which balances the final couplet of <span class="italic">Hekatompathia</span>; sonnet 60 has been shown to be by the earl of Oxford. The sonnets are frequently based on Gascoigne and seem to be tentative experiments in the English quatorzain form (14 lines, resembling a sonnet), perhaps not for publication; only one badly printed and mutilated copy is extant (Hunt. 32085).<br>
<br>Throughout his poetry Watson creates a sort of imaginary universe, and many repeated references to subjects, characters, and events, fictional and autobiographical and national, lead to an appreciation of his sense of the unity of things, and a clearer understanding of his pioneering efforts in improving the language, and of his intellectual control of form and content, tempered often by a humorous detachment, even self-parody. &#145;One can only wonder what he would have achieved, had his life not been cut short at a relatively young age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 2.192).<br>
<br>Watson's burial, during the plague year of 1592, is registered at St Bartholomew-the-Less inside the purlieus of the hospital, under 26 September, ten days before that of Hugh Swift in the same place. Through references to him by many authors (usually by the name Amyntas or to the amaranthus plant), through the praises of critics, and through reprintings of his poems in anthologies (some of which, however, are mere bogus copies of his style), his considerable reputation remained for a decade after his death.<br>
