<span class="headword">Butler, Sir  (George) Geoffrey Gilbert</span>  (1887&#150;1929), <span class="occ">historian and politician</span>, was born at 55 Harrington Gardens, Kensington, London, on 15 August 1887, the ninth son of Spencer Perceval Butler, conveyancing counsel of Lincoln's Inn, and his wife, Mary Kendall. He belonged to a distinguished academic family: he was a nephew of Henry Montagu Butler, George Butler (1819&#150;1890), and Arthur Gray Butler. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32215/', "Sir Montagu Sherard Dawes Butler")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32218/', "Sir (Spencer) Harcourt Butler")</script> were his brothers. Educated at Clifton College, where he later became a school governor, Butler matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1906, taking first class in both parts of the historical tripos, and was elected to a major college scholarship in his third year. He won the chancellor's medal for English verse, edited the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span>, and was president of the union in his fourth year. In June 1910 he was offered a fellowship at two colleges simultaneously. He chose that at Corpus Christi College where, as college lecturer and director of studies in history, he &#145;set out to make the teaching of that subject a vital factor in the college as a whole&#146;  (Bury, 241). In 1912 he became librarian, taking charge of the college's inestimable collection of manuscripts and incunabula created by Matthew Parker at the dissolution of the monasteries.<br>
<br>In 1913 Butler published an edition of the Edmondes papers and in 1914 a series of lectures, <span class="italic">The Tory Tradition</span>. He was, however, first and foremost a historian of international relations and of modern diplomatic history. According to his friend Sir William Spens, &#145;He regarded a European war in the near future as highly probable &hellip; [and] he did his best to ensure that the undergraduates of his college should have some idea of what war would mean&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). When the First World War broke out he was prevented by disability from military service. In the spring of 1915 he went to the Foreign Office, where he joined the news department, which was at the forefront in presenting the British perspective to the new media of foreign neutrals, especially to the United States. Here he had the advantage of knowing America, for in 1913 and 1914 he had been a visiting lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1916 he returned to lecture at the same university, and while there he married, on 17 November 1916, Elizabeth Levering Jones (<i>b</i>. 1892), eldest daughter of Joseph Levering Jones, a corporate lawyer of Philadelphia. They had no children. In 1917 he returned to America as part of the foreign secretary Arthur Balfour's mission. He remained in New York until 1919 as director of the British bureau of information, a post in which he fostered Anglo-American relations and for which he was made KBE (1919).<br>
<br>Butler returned to Cambridge in 1919, and was soon afterwards appointed praelector in diplomatic history at Corpus. He devoted himself to three things: &#145;to his duties as librarian of Corpus, and in particular to rearranging and cataloguing the incunabula and making the manuscripts more accessible; to his historical teaching; and to promoting conservative principles, as he understood these, among the undergraduates of the university&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). During these post-war years Butler published a number of books: <span class="italic">Studies in Statecraft</span> (1920); <span class="italic">Guide to an Exhibition of Historical Authorities of British History</span> (1920), derived from the college manuscript collection; <span class="italic">A Handbook to the League of Nations</span> (1925); and in 1928 <span class="italic">The Development of International Law</span>, written in conjunction with one of his former pupils. The first-named expounded to a wider audience his views on international relations and international law, particularly on the developing League of Nations. In it he argued strongly that the league should move cautiously and not to try to do too much before it had established its influence and authority.<br>
<br>A convinced Conservative, Butler saw that the coming of representative democracy at the end of the First World War had transformed the British parliamentary system, and realized that in order to meet these new challenges his party had to embrace a reformist platform. An obituarist described him as a &#145;Conservative of the new school&#146;  (Bury, 242). Within the university Butler tried to ensure the political education of like-minded undergraduates by developing the then new Cambridge University Conservative Association (CUCA) into &#145;a regular school for young Conservatives of ever growing value to the party&#146;  (Bury, 242). At the general election of 1923 he was returned as the Conservative MP (burgess) for the university. His talents were quickly recognized, and in 1925 he joined the Conservative ministry as parliamentary private secretary to Sir Samuel Hoare, the secretary of state for air. Butler introduced Hoare to his college, which quickly became his intellectual base. Butler's skills were also put to use in a number of other ways. He was a member of a Home Office committee on legal aid and a prominent member of the 1927 Donoughmore commission, which investigated the constitution of Ceylon. During these years Butler served on the council of the Royal Historical Society, as a syndic of the Cambridge University Press, and as secretary of the university's newly created board of research studies. His government and university duties came together with the formation of the Cambridge University air squadron, the first ever at a British university and one that trained many of the fighter pilots who later distinguished themselves in the Second World War.<br>
<br>Butler's health failed in the late 1920s, and after a business trip to the United States he died of cancer of the liver and of the stomach at 21 Bentinck Street, Marylebone, London, on 2 May 1929. He was commemorated by Corpus Christi College through several benefactions, and what was then the new students' library was named after him. Family members presented the college with his portrait together with a tankard with his chancellor's medal inset.<br>
