<span class="headword">Whitley,  Percival Nathan</span>  (1893&#150;1956), <span class="occ">cotton spinner and educationist</span>, was born on 1 October 1893 at Brantwood, Stafford Road, Halifax, the eldest of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36875/', "John Henry (Harry) Whitley (1866&#150;1935)")</script>, cotton spinner and politician, and his first wife, Marguerita Virginia 
    (Margaret; 1872&#150;1925)
  , daughter of Giulio Marchetti of Halifax and his wife, Anne. His maternal grandfather had fought with Garibaldi before settling in Halifax and marrying the daughter of the Halifax carpet manufacturer and philanthropist John Crossley. His paternal grandfather, Nathan Whitley, had acquired the cotton spinning firm of S. Whitley &amp; Co., Hanson Lane Mills, Halifax, in 1881, and twice served as mayor of Halifax. His father in turn became managing director of S. Whitley &amp; Co., served as Liberal (later Coalition Liberal) MP for Halifax from 1900 to 1928, and was speaker of the House of Commons from 1921 to 1928. He subsequently served as chairman of the board of governors of the BBC from 1931 until his death in 1935.<br>
<br>Whitley was educated at Rugby School and New College, Oxford, where he graduated with a pass degree before entering the family cotton spinning firm on the eve of the outbreak of the First World War. He had been introduced at an early age during school and college vacations to the pioneering youth work initiated by his father in Halifax, and after his father's death assumed responsibility for the management of the recreational gymnasium and annual summer camp at Filey for socially deprived Halifax boys (and later girls), which his father had founded. In 1914 he suffered considerable personal abuse and narrowly avoided imprisonment as a conscientious objector, but was twice mentioned in dispatches during the First World War for his distinguished voluntary service with the YMCA. He travelled to France with the British expeditionary force in April 1915 and then to Salonika, where he remained until June 1919, apart from a period of convalescence from malaria in Halifax.<br>
<br>After the war, Whitley returned to the family business and resumed his voluntary social work in Halifax. In 1921 he commenced a long period of office with the Boy Scout movement, ultimately serving as district commissioner from 1931 to 1943. He was also elected as a Liberal to the Halifax town council, following in his father's footsteps, and served on the borough's education committee for thirty years, becoming its youngest chairman in 1932. He shared both his father's preference for local rather than national politics and his unconventional disregard for the honours system. Indeed, his father's declining for personal reasons in 1928 of the hereditary viscountcy traditionally conferred on retiring speakers of the House of Commons was widely thought to have been out of sensitivity to his son's commitment to youth work in Halifax. Questioned by the press about how he felt about his father's unprecedented action, Whitley declared that he had &#145;never been more proud of his father than then&#146;  (Whitley, 10). As chairman of the Halifax education committee, he initiated a major school and college building programme following the recommendations of the Hadow Report and as a result of the need to provide new schools for the council estates created as a result of slum clearance schemes, and he was also responsible for the reorganization of secondary education under the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. He became a magistrate in 1933, an alderman in 1934, and mayor of Halifax in 1941&#150;2. During his mayoral year he wrote over a thousand letters to servicemen and servicewomen, and often used the civic car to ferry teams of young footballers across the town on Saturday afternoons. He also publicized the need to provide air raid precautions by plunging suitably attired into freezing cold water at the inauguration of a new static water tank as an emergency firefighting resource in April 1942. After the Second World War he led a party of young Halifax apprentices to Aachen to help repair bomb damage to the German city, laying the foundation for a highly successful programme of cultural exchanges between the twinned towns.<br>
<br>Whitley had a lifelong association with Park Congregational Church, Halifax, becoming a member at the age of eighteen and later serving as a deacon. He never married, and combined his extensive public service with his role as managing director of the family business. Although often pressed to stand as a parliamentary candidate, he always declined because of his business responsibilities and his commitment to voluntary work in Halifax. Apart from his penchant for pipe tobacco, which ultimately had disastrous consequences for his health, he had an ascetic lifestyle. Fair-haired, with a neatly trimmed moustache, he displayed in photographs a kindly, relaxed countenance and a slim, athletic build, which prompted Mary Trevelyan, the daughter of the historian George Macaulay Trevelyan, to remark that he had &#145;much of the look of a mediaeval saint&#146;  (Mary Trevelyan to P. N. Whitley, 5 Jan 1955, Whitley family MSS). Despite an innate shyness, he displayed a ready wit in dealing with hecklers at political meetings and a great sense of fun within his family circle. After contracting cancer of the tongue and enduring uncomfortable radium treatment, he confided to a family friend shortly before his death that he &#145;still went to the mill and Town Hall&#146; to reassure himself that he was &#145;still a little use to somebody&#146;  (Nora Dickin to Phyllis Bowman, 4 April 1956, Whitley family MSS). He died at his home, Brantwood, Rawson Avenue, Halifax, on 26 March 1956. Following a private cremation Eric Treacy, the archdeacon and vicar of Halifax, at a memorial service at Park Congregational Church, Halifax, on 29 March 1956, paid tribute to Whitley's &#145;gentle&#146;, good-humoured disposition, his &#145;outstanding ability&#146;, his &#145;strong convictions&#146;, and his decision &#145;to give himself without stint to the life of Halifax and to remain therefore comparatively unknown in the wider sphere&#146;  (Whitley, 11). His distinguished public service within the locality was recognized by his appointment as OBE, an honour which he was reluctantly persuaded to accept in the year before he died, and by the naming of extensions to the town's college of further education after him in 1957 and the construction of a new sports hall in his memory in 1959.<br>
