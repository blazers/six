<span class="headword">Barrington,  John</span>  (1764&#150;1824), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born on 9 October 1764 in Dublin, the first of three children of John Barrington (1723&#150;1784) and his second wife, Mary Anne (<i>fl</i>. 1763&#150;1789), daughter of William Plummer of Enniscorthy, co. Wexford. He was brought up in the Quaker faith to which the Barringtons had adhered since the seventeenth century. Following his father's death Barrington carried on the family business as a chandler in partnership with his mother. He later entered into a succession of other partnerships before he joined with his sons to form John Barrington &amp; Sons, wholesale soap and candlemakers, a firm which endured through several generations.<br>
<br>In 1787 Barrington married Thomasina (<i>c</i>.1767&#150;1788), daughter of Thomas and Eleanor Burton; she died on 15 July in the following year. His second wife, whom he married on 7 November 1792, was Margaret Manliffe (1773&#150;1869) of Edenderry, King's county, and they had thirteen children, eleven of whom survived to adulthood. Over time, his business built up and the company moved to progressively larger premises. Barrington lived in a succession of houses&#151;firstly alongside the factory at Bellview, by Dublin's Grand Canal Harbour, then in suburban locations outside the city at Rathfarnham and Blackrock. Finally, in 1808, he acquired about 150 acres at Glendruid, near Cabinteely, 9 miles south of Dublin, and built a substantial house with outhouses and a viewing tower.<br>
<br>As Barrington's fortunes increased he became involved with a number of charitable or philanthropic projects. The earliest of these was the fever hospital in Dublin's Cork Street, which opened in 1804 and for which he was active in fund-raising. Over its nearly one and a half centuries the hospital always had a number of Quakers, including John Barrington and his son Edward, on its board. In 1808 John Barrington was among those who established the Dublin Free School in School Street, close to his business premises in Bellview. This establishment was founded to give instruction to poor children of both sexes and was largely supported by subscriptions. Three years later, in a further attempt to foster the intellectual growth of the citizens of Dublin, Barrington and others established the Dublin Institution, operating from a house in Sackville Street, where there was a library and a lecture room. The aim of this foundation was to promote science, literature, and the arts, and it was funded by shares held by a group of individuals who also subscribed a small sum each year. Finally, at the close of his life, Barrington became a founder member of the Patriotic Assurance Company, a body which, like the others in which he was involved, included a substantial Quaker element among its promoters.<br>
<br>Though born and brought up as a member of the Religious Society of Friends, Barrington (according to the family biographer) left the society about 1801. However, he continued to attend the society's meetings, and his affiliations to organizations in which there was Quaker involvement show that he remained close to the society. Barrington's philanthropy also earned him an esteemed reputation beyond Quaker circles. According to his son Richard:<blockquote>my father, indeed, was no common man. I scarcely think I exaggerate when I give it as my opinion that he was very highly respected, not only by those in his own mercantile class, but also by those other classes with whom his activity in furthering objects for the common good brought him into contact. His well-known integrity and independence of opinion &hellip; were highly appreciated. (Barrington, 177)</blockquote>John Barrington died of typhus fever on 2 April 1824 and was buried in the ancient churchyard of Tullagh, close to his home at Glendruid. In 1846 the Barrington family established a private burial-ground within the grounds of Glendruid, and Barrington's remains were exhumed from Tullagh and reburied in the family plot.<br>
