<span class="headword">Morton,  Alastair James Fagan</span>  (1910&#150;1963), <span class="occ">textile manufacturer and abstract painter</span>, was born on 12 February 1910 at Home Acres, Brampton Road, Carlisle (now Cumbria College of Art and Design), the elder son and fifth of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48074/', "Sir James Morton (1867&#150;1943)")</script> and Beatrice Emily Fagan (1871&#150;1958). Both his father and grandfather Alexander Morton (1844&#150;1923) were textile manufacturers.<br>
<br>Morton was educated at St George's School, Harpenden, but his attendance was dogged by illness, which permanently impaired his heart. In 1929&#150;30 he studied mathematics at Edinburgh University before going to Balliol College, Oxford, where he spent a year. On 17 September 1931 he married Flavia Birrell (1910&#150;2001), whom he had met at school. They had three children: Alec (<i>b</i>. 1932); Joslyn (<i>b</i>. 1934), a sculptor who married the artist Joe Tilson in 1956; and Rachel (<i>b</i>. 1938).<br>
<br>Morton joined Morton Sundour Fabrics Ltd, an offshoot of the family firm of Alexander Morton &amp; Co., in 1931. In 1932 he moved to Edinburgh Weavers, a research unit established by his father in 1928 to pioneer fabric design in keeping with contemporary architecture and interior decoration. Morton emerged as a designer of considerable talent, and was appointed the unit's artistic director. Edinburgh Weavers became the most innovative textile producers in Britain, as Morton commissioned leading artists and designers to design fabrics of outstanding originality and quality. Perhaps the high point of its pre-war production was the range of &#145;constructivist fabrics&#146; of 1937, featuring designs by, among others, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, and Ashley Havinden.<br>
<br>Morton began painting in 1936, and is best-known for his abstract work in the modernist style. He was one of a small group of artists in pre-war Britain who championed the new movement, and showed in exhibitions such as &#145;Living Art in England&#146; at the London Gallery, London (1939), &#145;Abstract Paintings by Nine British Artists&#146; at the Lefevre Gallery, London (1939), and &#145;England Today&#146;, a touring exhibition shown in Melbourne and Sydney in 1940. His work was shown alongside that of artists who included Piet Mondrian, Naum Gabo, Barbara Hepworth, and Henry Moore. After the war he began to create exquisitely rendered botanical drawings (examples of which are in the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester). His commitment to modernist architecture was shown in 1936, when he commissioned Brackenfell, near Brampton, Carlisle, a house designed by Leslie Martin and Sadie Speight into which he moved with his family in 1937.<br>
<br>Delicate health prevented Morton from fighting in the war, and he worked as a photographer for the National Buildings Record before studying handweaving and spinning with Ethel Mairet in Sussex during the winter of 1943&#150;4. In 1945 he and Flavia divorced, and in July he married (Mary Isabella) Cherry Lawson (1907&#150;1998). They moved to the Lake District, where they lived until Morton's death and where he set up a handweaving studio to produce striking ranges of fabrics and rugs. They had one child, Alison (<i>b</i>. 1946), a handweaver and designer. Between 1947 and 1954 Morton designed a popular and critically acclaimed series of dress prints for Horrockses Fashions Ltd, of Preston, while restrictions after the war led him to experiment with ramie fibre, as well as cowhair and wool. In 1946 he launched his &#145;unit prints&#146;, a system of screen prints that could be mixed and matched at will.<br>
<br>Morton became increasingly concerned with teaching design, and during the 1940s regularly wrote articles and lectured on the subject to bodies such as the Design and Industries Association and the Cotton Board, who commissioned him to enquire into the state of textile design in 1944. He also became assessor for textiles for the four central Scottish art schools. He led a renaissance at Edinburgh Weavers between 1955 and 1963 as a new generation of artists including William Scott, Victor Vasarely, and Marino Marini designed fabrics for him and allowed their images to be used for production. At the same time his professional responsibilities grew, culminating in his appointment as chief executive director of Morton Sundour Fabrics Ltd in 1962. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists in 1947, was made an honorary designer of the Royal College of Art in 1954, and became a royal designer for industry and a member of the Council of Industrial Design in 1960. In 1961 Edinburgh Weavers received the royal warrant of appointment, with Morton as warrant-holder. His hobbies included hill farming (in particular the breeding of Belted Galloways), photography, natural history, and music. He died of heart failure at his home&#151;Hollows, Dockray, near Penrith&#151;on 30 June 1963, and was cremated at Carlisle crematorium on 3 July.<br>
<br>Morton was a pioneer of modernism in Britain. His innovative textile designing and weaving, his enlightened commissioning of other artists, his practical knowledge of textile manufacture and willingness to experiment, and his work as a painter have secured him a permanent place in the history of twentieth-century design. Edinburgh Weavers changed the face of the European textile industry, while Morton's achievements as a painter have been recognized more recently in various exhibitions, including those at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, and Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal. His work, both as a painter and as a textile designer and weaver, is represented in many public collections, most importantly those in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester; the Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal; and the Craft Study Centre at the Surrey Institute of Art and Design.<br>
