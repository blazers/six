<span class="headword">Procter,  Jane</span>  (1810&#150;1882), <span class="occ">headmistress and temperance campaigner</span>, was born on 2 November 1810 in Worsell in the parish of Kirklevington in Yorkshire, the first of the four children of James Procter (1766&#150;1816), merchant, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Thurnam of Osbaldwick in the North Riding of Yorkshire and his wife, Elizabeth. Both her parents were members of the Religious Society of Friends and on her father's side she could trace her Quaker ancestry back to the last quarter of the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>As a child, Jane lived initially in the Yorkshire town of Yarm, near Stockton-on-Tees, before her family moved to Blackburn in Lancashire. After her father's death in 1816, her mother took her and her three younger sisters back to Yorkshire where they went to live with her father's cousins in the small town of Selby. Here she enjoyed a relatively comfortable existence and in 1821 was sent to Ackworth School, a co-educational boarding-school near Pontefract in the West Riding of Yorkshire, which had been founded in 1779 on the initiative of the Quaker physician, John Fothergill.<br>
<br>Jane Procter could have stayed on at Ackworth to train as a teacher, but after four years she decided to go and work in a private Quaker school in Doncaster. She returned to Selby after the death of her mother in 1828. Although only eighteen at the time, she automatically assumed responsibility for the welfare of her sisters but was apparently given considerable assistance by the Quaker meeting in Selby which arranged for a couple to live with the girls until Jane was able to prove her competence in running a household. She decided to establish a girls' school of her own and with her sisters' help set up a modest institution under the shadow of the abbey. This proved a successful venture which lasted for twenty years. But as the prosperity of Selby declined with the collapse of the cottage linen industry, Jane and her two unmarried sisters, Barbara and Elizabeth, eventually decided to move to the expanding town of Darlington in co. Durham to set up a new school. A property was duly purchased in July 1848 and a new boarding-school was opened shortly afterwards at 11 Houndgate under the name of Selby House.<br>
<br>At Selby House, Jane Procter offered the daughters of the more prosperous Quaker families a &#145;liberal and useful education&#146; which emphasized the &#145;practical utility of literary and scientific pursuits&#146; and thus included such varied subjects as astronomy, botany, Latin, and Greek. Despite the rather daring nature of the venture, the school proved a success and after six years was moved to larger premises on a nearby estate where it became known as Polam Hall. As a headmistress, she showed herself to be a woman of commanding presence who, although not physically imposing, was able to inspire great respect and devotion from her pupils. An enthusiastic and skilful teacher, she had the capacity to make learning enjoyable and, despite her own rather austere lifestyle, was renowned for her kindness and generosity. Indeed, it was said of her that she possessed the rare quality of commanding respect without severity and of influencing and guiding her pupils to aspire to the highest ideals without apparent effort on her part.<br>
<br>As a member of the governing committee of the British and Foreign School Society's Training College for Mistresses in Darlington, Jane Procter helped to promote teaching as a profession among working-class women in the north of England following the introduction of compulsory elementary education under the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870. But Polam Hall nevertheless remained the focus of her existence and under her direction it became a thriving educational institution, as well as a meeting place for the local Friends' Essay Society. It also became a centre for temperance activity: Jane and her sister Elizabeth had established the Darlington Women's Temperance Association in 1850 and over the years the school played host to a series of fund-raising activities, while its pupils were entertained by a steady stream of visiting temperance lecturers who came to enjoy the sisters' hospitality.<br>
<br>Jane Procter remained headmistress of Polam Hall for thirty-four years, running the school with the help of her sister Elizabeth following the death of Barbara Procter in 1859. Although a strong, independent-minded woman, she relied heavily on Elizabeth for support and was greatly shocked by her sudden death during a holiday in Frankfurt in 1881. Jane Procter herself died suddenly while on a visit to Rome, on 5 January 1882, less than five months after the loss of her sister. She was buried in the city's protestant cemetery, where a group of her former pupils had a marble monument erected to mark her grave.<br>
