<span class="headword">Oliver,  Thomas</span>  (1791&#150;1857), <span class="occ">architect and surveyor</span>, was born on 14 January 1791 at Over Crailing, near Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, the second son of Adam Oliver (1749&#150;1793), weaver, and his wife, Elizabeth Bell (1762&#150;1829). He was educated at Jedburgh School before working for his future father-in-law, James Lorimer (or Lorrimer), a Kelso stonemason. He moved to Newcastle in or just before 1814, when he married Margaret Lorimer (<i>d</i>. 1838), with whom he had two daughters and four sons. He married secondly, in 1840, Elizabeth Best, with whom he had a son, Charles William (1847&#150;1855). In 1821 he began independent practice as a &#145;land surveyor and architect&#146;; this was after six years as pupil and assistant to his more illustrious and slightly older contemporary John Dobson, by whom Oliver tended to be overshadowed throughout his career.<br>
<br>In fact, the number of buildings which can be ascribed to Oliver is comparatively small. His principal contribution is perhaps the series of superb engraved maps of Newcastle which he issued in 1830, 1844, 1849, 1851, and (posthumously) 1858, and his topographical works <span class="italic">A New Picture of Newcastle upon Tyne</span> (1831) and <span class="italic">The Topographical Conductor: a Descriptive Guide to Newcastle and Gateshead</span> (1851). In addition, he undertook a number of more specific surveys for the corporation and between 1824 and 1825 worked as a surveyor for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company.<br>
<br>Oliver was also a noteworthy planner in his own right. He put forward several unexecuted schemes for new streets which would have considerably improved Newcastle's inadequate communication routes; some of these are indicated on his 1830 <span class="italic">Plan of Newcastle upon Tyne</span>. However, claims that he was the real author of the entrepreneur Richard Grainger's redevelopment of central Newcastle between 1834 and 1839 cannot be sustained. Oliver's ideas were concerned mainly with the periphery of the town, and his <span class="italic">Plan of Building Ground, Together with Proposed and Projected Improvements in Newcastle upon Tyne</span> of July 1834 indicates that he was summarizing rather than initiating events; it shows not only Grainger's proposals but also those of other developers (including one planned by Dobson) and was almost certainly produced for public sale rather than for Grainger himself.<br>
<br>Oliver's architecture lies within the classical tradition of late Georgian and early Victorian Newcastle. Here his main work was Leazes Terrace, an extended stone-faced block, built for Grainger between 1829 and 1834, together with the elegant but more modest Leazes Crescent; he also designed the West Clayton Street Congregational Chapel (1850&#150;51; dem.). Earlier he had designed for Dr John Baird in 1824 a pair of fashionably stone-fronted houses on the west side of Northumberland Street (dem.), and prepared for the corporation plans for Blackett Street and Eldon Square. The latter two developments were, however, ultimately financed by Grainger and built (1824 and 1825&#150;31 respectively; now mostly dem.) largely to the designs of Dobson. Between 1836 and 1848 he laid out for George Tallantire Gibson a development of neat two- and three-storey streets &#145;suited to the wants of the humble yet respectable classes of the community&#146;  (J. Collingwood Bruce, <span class="italic">Handbook to Newcastle upon Tyne</span>, 1863, 116). It contained the Gibson Street Methodist (New Connexion) Chapel of 1837 and the Victoria Bazaar (1836&#150;7), a triangular shopping arcade at the junction of Buxton, Gibson, and Melbourne streets which was possibly the prototype for Grainger's prestigious central arcade (<i>c</i>.1836&#150;8) in Grey Street. &#145;Gibson Town&#146; (dem. 1962&#150;8) would, with additional parts of east Newcastle, have been conveniently linked to the quayside had an improvement scheme by Oliver of 1855 been implemented. Oliver died on 9 December 1857, at his home, 3 Picton Place, Newcastle, and was buried in Jesmond (formerly Newcastle general) cemetery. Of his sons by his first marriage, two were civil engineers, while Thomas jun. (1824&#150;1902) became a noted architect in Sunderland and, after his father's death, founded in 1881 the Newcastle partnership of Oliver and Leeson (later Oliver, Leeson, and Wood).<br>
