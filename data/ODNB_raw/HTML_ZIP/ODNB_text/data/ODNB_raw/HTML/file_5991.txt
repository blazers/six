<span class="headword">Colquhoun,  John Campbell</span>  (1803&#150;1870), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was born at Killermont, Dunbartonshire, on 23 January 1803, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5986/', "Archibald Campbell-Colquhoun (c.1754&#150;1820)")</script>, lord clerk register, and his wife, Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1833), daughter of William Erskine, Episcopalian minister of Muthill. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and Oriel College, Oxford, where he matriculated in March 1820 and took his BA, with first-class honours, in 1823. On the death of his father in 1820 he inherited Killermont, and in 1821 he also inherited estates at Garscadden from his kinswoman Jean Colquhoun. On 10 September 1827 he married Henrietta Maria Powys (1799&#150;1870), eldest daughter of Thomas Powys, second Baron Lilford. She was to be a strong influence on him, particularly in reinforcing his evangelical inclinations. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Colquhoun began his political career as an advocate of moderate reform. He was first returned to parliament in 1832, representing Dunbartonshire and sitting as a radical. Over the next few years, however, his evangelical convictions led him to join the growing rally in defence of the established churches and hence to change his political loyalties. Between 1834 and 1836 he played a major part in extra-parliamentary agitation in defence of the Church of Ireland, and subsequently campaigned in favour of the maintenance of church rates in England. He did not contest the 1835 general election, but in 1837 was returned for the Kilmarnock burghs, as a tory.<br>
<br>In the late 1830s Colquhoun was admitted to the inner counsels of the Conservative Party, where his staunch protestantism was found consistent with the mood of the moment. At the same time Thomas Chalmers saw him as the potential leader of &#145;a religious party in Parliament&#146;  (Colquhoun MSS, bundle 85, 26 June 1841). Although himself an Episcopalian, Colquhoun supported the causes of evangelicalism and non-intrusion in the Church of Scotland. In the 1841 general election campaign, however, he refused demands to make his support for Peel conditional on the latter agreeing to further the cause of the church's independence. He accordingly lost his seat and, subsequently, desiring above all to see the Church of Scotland strong and united, he was to regard the Disruption in 1843 as a calamity. Thereafter he distanced himself from his Scottish roots.<br>
<br>Although Colquhoun was shortly to be back in the Commons, returned for Newcastle under Lyme at a by-election in 1842, Peel failed to reward his loyalty and left him on the back benches at a juncture when his views were becoming politically less convenient. In 1845 the Maynooth question was the spark which ignited Colquhoun's feelings of personal betrayal and outraged principle. He moved to open revolt against the prime minister, not only opposing him in the house, but also publishing pamphlets denouncing the government's record. In addition he organized the National Club as a rallying point for those who sought a stronger protestant and Anglican basis for politics. Nevertheless, despite his evident ambition, he lacked a sufficiently credible and broad basis of support to become a major player in the post-Peel Conservative Party.<br>
<br>In 1847 Colquhoun, suffering from failing health and political disappointment, decided to take &#145;refuge in religious politics&#146; and rule &#145;supreme in Exeter Hall&#146;  (Disraeli MSS, A/X/A/13). He retired from parliament and over the next two decades took a prominent role in the National Club and in other Anglican societies committed to the maintenance of protestant interests, notably the Irish Church Missions and, in the 1860s, the Church Association. He also developed his literary and historical interests. As well as several pamphlets on contemporary political and religious questions, he published a historical volume on France and Italy, and a number of biographical works.<br>
<br>Colquhoun was devastated by his wife's death in January 1870, and himself died at home at 8 Chesham Street, London, on 17 April 1870. He was buried at Crockham church, Kent. In his youth he had seemed to be a man with outstanding prospects, but he eventually showed himself lacking in the toughness and breadth of outlook requisite for a successful secular politician. His most significant role was as a key lay leader of Anglican evangelicalism in the generation after the death of William Wilberforce.<br>
