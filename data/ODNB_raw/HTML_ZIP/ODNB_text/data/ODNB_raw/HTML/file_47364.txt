<span class="headword">Heywood,  Abel</span>  (1810&#150;1893), <span class="occ">newsagent and publisher</span>, was born on 25 February 1810 in Prestwich, Lancashire, the youngest son of the four children born to Betty and John Heywood, whose second marriage it was. John Heywood, a &#145;putter out&#146; for weavers, died in 1812. In 1819 his widow moved to Manchester and the nine-year-old Abel began working for a local manufacturer, Thomas Worthington, at the weekly wage of 18<i>d</i>. The energy and application which were to distinguish his long life were already evident and by fourteen he was in charge of sixty other boys and attending the Lion Hill Sunday school in Bennet Street. He left the Sunday school over a perceived injustice but continued his self-education by becoming one of the first members of the mechanics' institution.<br>
<br>In 1831, having been summarily dismissed, Heywood took the bold step of opening a penny reading-room for the working class in Oldham Street. This was rapidly followed by his setting up as a wholesale newsagent and acquiring the agency for the <span class="italic">Poor Man's Guardian</span>. Because this paper refused to pay the government stamp duty designed to make newspapers too expensive for the working class, its sale was deemed illegal and Heywood was duly charged and sentenced. He was fined &pound;54, which he refused to pay because he believed the charge unjust. He was, therefore, sent to the Salford New Bailey for four months. His mother and family kept the business going and, when released, he returned to selling the illegal paper, incurring two further fines in 1834 and 1836, both of &pound;18&#151;which this time he paid. His commitment to cheap newspapers for the working class and resistance to the &#145;taxes on knowledge&#146; continued unabated. In 1834 he printed almanacs on cotton handkerchiefs to avoid the tax and in 1838 he was selling 18,000 copies weekly of the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>, the Leeds-based radical paper.<br>
<br>Despite selling what one contemporary described as &#145;insurgent literature &hellip; for sans culottes&#146;  (Manchester City Library, cuttings file), Heywood's business prospered and the rental of his shop was enough to make him eligible for the post of a commissioner of police to which he was elected in 1836. He claimed that this&#151;and all his subsequent public work&#151;was undertaken in the interests of the working class who &#145;knew of my sympathy with them&#146;  (ibid.). He took a leading role in the bitter struggle for incorporation of the city and was elected to the new city council when it was finally created in 1843.<br>
<br>For the rest of his life, Heywood was active on that council, as alderman in 1853 and twice as mayor, in 1862&#150;3 during the cotton famine when he was on the Lancashire Relief Committee, and in 1876&#150;7. In 1859 and 1865 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament as a Liberal. His major public work was, therefore, as a member of Manchester city council, particularly on the paving, sewering, and highways committee which he chaired for forty-seven years. His concern for the conditions of the poor was a motive force in overseeing Manchester's ambitious waterworks and sewage building programme and the later development of its tramway system.<br>
<br>Heywood's other major achievement was in initiating and seeing to completion the building he hoped would symbolize Manchester's greatness, the new town hall, opened in his second period as mayor. The queen's refusal to attend the opening and to give Heywood an honour led to a storm of rumours about his publishing past which were indignantly refuted by his friends. Instead of a royal visit, there was a procession of trades in his honour and, at his invitation, citizens paraded through their new town hall. On 28 November 1891 he was given the freedom of the city, the third man to be so honoured.<br>
<br>Despite his other activities, Heywood kept a close hold on the running of the Oldham Street business, which by 1851 was the largest wholesale newsagency in the country, as well as a general bookshop and publishing house, with a subsidiary interest in paper-making. When the 1851 parliamentary select committee on newspaper stamps met, Heywood provided detailed accounts of the sales of cheap periodicals in the Manchester region which his firm supplied. He handled probably 10 per cent of the national sales of the cheapest papers. Defending the quality of this press to the committee, he argued not only that the remaining tax on news should go but that the working class wanted good papers and would choose them in preference to immoral or seditious publications, if they could. Here the radical politician and the print entrepreneur were at one.<br>
<br>With his publisher brother, John, Heywood also played a crucial role in regional culture, publishing local writers, both in standard English and dialect, and producing local periodicals including <span class="italic">Ben Brierley's Journal</span>. Heywood took his son, also named Abel (<i>b</i>. 1840), into partnership in 1864 (and later his grandson), thus ensuring the family control of the business he had built up from his penny reading-room.<br>
<br>Throughout his life, Heywood was a supporter of a range of social and political causes, a ready speaker at public events where he would be found on his legs, and notable for his fluency or long-windedness, depending on the nature of the debate. In private conversation, however, he was more taciturn, a trait which offended those who believed their status merited more regard. A rationalist, with an interest in the ideas of Robert Owen, Heywood promoted the Hall of Science at Campfield and was treasurer of the Rational Sick and Burial Club.<br>
<br>Heywood was married twice, first to Ann Shelmerdine, and then to Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Goadsby, his fellow alderman. He had four children. A tall, somewhat gaunt though handsome man, Heywood was careless of his appearance and often looked dishevelled at public events. One contemporary described him as like some horses who are &#145;bad at grooming&#146; but have plenty of &#145;go&#146; in them  (<span class="italic">City Jackdaw</span>). In the 1870s Heywood moved out from Manchester to the suburb of Bowdon in Cheshire. He died of heart disease at Summerfield, Rosehill, his home there, on 19 August 1893, leaving a reputation in the city as a true &#145;Manchester Man&#146;.<br>
