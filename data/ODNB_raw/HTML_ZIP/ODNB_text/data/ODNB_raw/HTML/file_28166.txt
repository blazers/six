<span class="headword">Vaux,  William Sandys Wright</span>  (1818&#150;1885), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in Oxford on 28 February 1818, the only son of William Vaux (1783/4&#150;1844), Church of England clergyman, who was prebendary of Winchester from 1831. He was educated at Westminster School from 1831 to 1836, when he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford (where his father had held a fellowship); he graduated BA in 1840 and proceeded MA in 1842. On 13 April 1841 he entered the department of antiquities of the British Museum as a first-class assistant. When the department was split on the retirement of the keeper, Edward Hawkins, he became on 21 January 1861 the first keeper of coins and medals. He married, on 11 July 1861, Louisa, eldest daughter of Francis Rivington of Harley Street, London.<br>
<br>Vaux's administration of the department was criticized following the abrupt departure of Frederic Madden junior in 1868. In July 1870 he appears to have had a breakdown and disappeared without warning, only to be located at Portsea. He was subsequently obliged to appear before a trustees' committee investigating losses from the collection, but was cleared of blame and allowed in October 1870 to resign with a pension. From 1871 to 1876 Vaux was engaged in cataloguing the coins in the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>From 1846 Vaux was a member of the council of the Numismatic Society. In 1852 he became one of the secretaries, and for some time assisted John Yonge Akerman in editing the first series of the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span>, in which he himself wrote twenty-five papers. He was president of the society from 1855 to 1874. For many years the society met in Vaux's rooms in Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. On 4 June 1868 he became a fellow of the Royal Society. From November 1875 to his death he was the secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and for many years he was secretary to the Royal Society of Literature and was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was also connected with the early development of the Oxford Movement in London, and his rooms were a frequent place of meeting for the subcommittees connected with the London Church Union and the foreign chaplaincies. He died at his home, 102 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, on 21 June 1885.<br>
<br>Vaux's knowledge was large and varied, more especially in all that related to oriental antiquities. His <span class="italic">Nineveh and Persepolis</span> (1850; 4th edn, 1855) is still of interest and did much to popularize the discoveries of Layard and others. He was responsible for <span class="italic">Inscriptions in the Phoenician Character &hellip; Discovered on the Site of Carthage, etc</span> (1863; lithographed facsimile), a transliteration into Hebrew characters with Latin translation. In 1864&#150;5 he worked with A. W. Franks revising Hawkins's <span class="italic">Catalogue of British Medals</span>, which eventually appeared in 1885. He also wrote: <span class="italic">Handbook to the antiquities in the British Museum: a description of the remains of Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian, and Etruscan art</span> (1851), <span class="italic">Ancient History from the Monuments: Persia from the Earliest Period to the Arab Conquest</span> (1875; rev. edn by Prof. A. H. Sayce, 1893), and <span class="italic">Ancient History from the Monuments: Greek Cities and Islands of Asia Minor</span> (1877). In 1854 he edited for the Hakluyt Society <span class="italic">The World Encompassed by Sir F. Drake</span>.<br>
<br>Vaux's contribution as a numismatist is not now regarded as of great significance. Little cataloguing took place during his keepership and he wrote relatively few articles. He is described as &#145;kind-hearted and unselfish&#146; with &#145;a large circle of friends and acquaintances&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 145).<br>
