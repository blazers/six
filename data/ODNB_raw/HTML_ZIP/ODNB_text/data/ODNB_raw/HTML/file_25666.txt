<span class="headword">Skene,  Felicia Mary Frances</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Erskine Moir]</span>  (1821&#150;1899), <span class="occ">writer and philanthropist</span>, born on 23 May 1821 at Aix-en-Provence, France, was the youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25668/', "James Skene (1775&#150;1864)")</script>, lawyer, of Rubislaw, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Jane Forbes (1787&#150;1862), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9848/', "Sir William Forbes")</script> of Pitsligo, sixth baronet. She spent much of her early childhood in Paris. When the family moved to Edinburgh, she played with the grandchildren of the exiled Charles X of France at Holyroodhouse and was, on occasion, the preferred companion of her father's friend, the ailing Sir Walter Scott (&#145;he felt unequal to any society but that of his friend's youngest child, who would amuse him with her merry <i>bavardage</i>&#146;; &#145;Glimpses of some vanished celebrities&#146;, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, 158, 1895, 2). The family lived at Athens between 1838 and 1845, where she became acquainted with Greece's Bavarian king, Otho (and was amused by his use of &#145;broad Scotticisms&#146;). From Athens the family visited Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, British ambassador at Constantinople. Skene's years spent on the continent rendered her an accomplished linguist. After 1845 the Skenes divided their time between Scotland and Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, where they settled after several years. There Skene met Thomas Chamberlain, vicar of St Thomas's, Oxford, and through him his cousin Marian Hughes, the Anglican nun. Skene became drawn to the religious and intellectual life of Oxford and influenced her family's move to 28 Beaumont Street, Oxford, in 1849; they moved to Frewin Hall in the early 1860s.<br>
<br>It was with Oxford that Skene's subsequent career was most intimately associated. Here she became acquainted with E. B. Pusey and his biographer, Henry Liddon, became a sympathetic proponent of the Oxford Movement, and taught at Marian Hughes's school. She also won the active support and admiration of Sir Henry Acland and Benjamin Jowett, as, during the cholera epidemic in the city in 1854, she organized a band of nurses, some of whom were later sent to the Crimea to work with Florence Nightingale. She maintained a correspondence with Nightingale throughout the Crimean War, admiring &#145;beyond measure her admirable care and accuracy&#146;  (&#145;Some episodes in a long life&#146;, <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, 159, 1896, 543). She also supported the antivivisection work of her friend Frances Power Cobbe. Skene took much interest in rescuing girls from prostitution, and from 1878, with Home Office sanction, she dedicated herself to prison-visiting at Oxford gaol. Some of her experiences were described in a series of five unsigned articles published in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> from November 1888 to August 1889 (reprinted in 1889 as <span class="italic">Scenes from a Silent World, or, Prisons and their Inmates</span> under the pseudonym Francis Scougal), in her study <span class="italic">Penitentiaries and Reformatories</span> (1865), and in her article &#145;Prison visiting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, Dec 1880). Her interest in the &#145;eminently unsatisfactory existence&#146; of vagrants is evident in her &#145;Ethics of the tramp&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, May 1898, 688).<br>
<br>Skene's earliest published volumes, <span class="italic">Isles of Greece and other Poems</span> (1843) and <span class="italic">Wayfaring Sketches among the Greeks and Turks on the Shores of the Danube</span> (1849), drew on her seven years' residence in south-east Europe. Her popular devotional work, <span class="italic">The Divine Master</span> (1852), which went to several editions, was followed in 1854 by <span class="italic">The Ministry of Consolation</span>, in 1883 by <span class="italic">The Shadow of the Holy Week</span>, and by memoirs of her cousin Alexander Penrose Forbes, bishop of Brechin (1876), and of Alexander Lycurgus, archbishop of the Cyclades (1877). She was also the editor of the <span class="italic">Churchman's Companion</span> (1862&#150;80). Her first novel, <span class="italic">Use and Abuse</span> (1849), follows the careers of two rivals, Raymond and Arabyn. It was succeeded by <span class="italic">The Tutor's Ward</span> (1851) and <span class="italic">Hidden Depths</span> (1866; repr. 1886), the latter a fictional exposure of prostitution in Oxford (&#145;Greyburgh&#146;) which, the author claimed, drew on scenes that she had personally witnessed. Her later fiction includes <span class="italic">A Strange Inheritance</span> (1886), the story of a gentlemanly emigrant's return to Scotland, and <span class="italic">The Lesters: a Family Record</span> (1887). In the mid-1870s she also serialized novels, in <span class="italic">The Quiver</span>: <span class="italic">Still and Deep</span> in 1875, <span class="italic">Raymond</span> in 1876, and <span class="italic">More than Conqueror</span> in 1878. Under the pseudonym Erskine Moir she published <span class="italic">Through the Shadows: a Test of the Truth</span> (1888) and felt this to be her most important religious work. Apart from her contributions to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, she also published articles in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>. Skene died, unmarried, of bronchitis at her home, 34 St Michael Street, Oxford, on 6 October 1899.<br>
