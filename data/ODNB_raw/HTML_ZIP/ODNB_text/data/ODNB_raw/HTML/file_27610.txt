<span class="headword">Townsend,  George Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1869), <span class="occ">compiler of reference works and journalist</span>, was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27612/', "John Townsend (1757&#150;1826)")</script>, and nephew of George Townsend (1788&#150;1857). Townsend was a prominent tory journalist. He edited <span class="italic">The Herald</span> during the minority tory government of 1858&#150;9, being dismissed, despite tory protests, about November 1859. As editor, he had close contacts with Lord Malmesbury, the foreign secretary  (Earle to Disraeli, November 1859, MS Hughenden B/XX/E177). Townsend then recommended the foundation of a joint-stock company to develop the tory press in London, a proposal too adventurous even for Disraeli. He was editor and manager of <span class="italic">The Press</span> from about 1865. He worked consistently for his party and understood that following the general election in 1868 he would receive some preferment&#151;perhaps a civil-list pension&#151;as his reward. However, Disraeli resigned without finding anything for him and Townsend, deeply disappointed, committed suicide at Kennington, London, on 23 February 1869 by stabbing himself.<br>
<br>Townsend wrote <span class="italic">Shakespeare not an Impostor</span> (1857), but his chief literary contribution was as a compiler and editor. He produced an epitome in 1857 of William Russell's <span class="italic">History of Modern Europe</span>, and edited several literary volumes. His <span class="italic">Manual of Dates</span> was published in 1857 and, in its fifth edition, by Frederick Martin (1877), remains useful, though largely superseded by Haydn's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Dates</span>. Townsend edited the seventh edition of <span class="italic">Men of the time</span> in 1868.<br>
<br>Besides these works, Townsend between 1860 and 1866 wrote several pamphlets containing selections of madrigals and glees for John Green, the proprietor of Evans's music and supper rooms, 43 Covent Garden. As these pamphlets purport to be compiled by John Green, confusion arose, and Green was sometimes regarded as a pseudonym of Townsend. The two were, however, entirely distinct. <a name="cosubject_11390"></a><span class="headword">John <span class="st"> [Paddy]</span> Green</span>  (1801&#150;1874) was an <span class="occ">actor at the Old English Opera House, London, and at Covent Garden</span>. He became manager of the Cider Cellars in Maiden Lane, the Strand, and took part as a singer in the entertainments there. In 1842 he became chairman and conductor of music at Evans's Hall, and in 1845 succeeded W. C. Evans (<i>d</i>. 1855) as proprietor. In 1865 he sold the concern to a joint-stock company for &pound;30,000. In 1866 he gave evidence before a parliamentary committee on theatrical licences. He died in London at 6 Farm Street, Mayfair, on 12 December 1874. His collection of theatrical portraits was sold at Christies on 22 July 1871. The Cider Cellars and Evans's Hall were the originals of W. M. Thackeray's &#145;Cave of Harmony&#146;.<br>
