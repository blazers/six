<span class="headword">Waldman,  Ronald Hartley</span>  (1914&#150;1978), <span class="occ">television executive</span>, was born at 32 Gore Road, South Hackney, London, on 13 May 1914, the second of three sons of Michael Ernest Waldman, chief clerk with a firm of wholesale merchants supplying mineral water, and his wife, Bloema Greenberg. Born into a Jewish family, he grew up in London. Waldman was educated at Owen's School and Pembroke College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in history and was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society.<br>
<br>Waldman learned his craft as an actor and a producer with the Brighton Repertory Company and he wrote and composed theatrical reviews. He joined the BBC in 1938 as a variety producer and under the tutelage of Harry S. Pepper he became skilled in the creation of such radio programmes as <span class="italic">Monday Night at Seven</span> (later <span class="italic">Monday Night at Eight</span>). His voice became familiar through &#145;Puzzle corner&#146;, a popular part of the programme. His career was interrupted by the Second World War: he served in the RAF and produced variety shows for the armed services. He returned to BBC radio in 1945 and moved to BBC television in 1950. On 23 February 1953 Waldman married an actress, Lana (1930/31&#150;1998), daughter of Sydney Morris, a skirt manufacturer. They had a son.<br>
<br>Waldman joined in the BBC television pioneering days at Alexandra Palace when television was the junior partner to radio. By the time competition arrived on 22 September 1955 in the shape of ITV, Waldman, now head of light entertainment, was responsible for 450 programmes a year. There were variety programmes like <span class="italic">Caf&eacute; Continental</span>, <span class="italic">This is Show Business with Vic Oliver</span> (Sir Winston Churchill's son-in-law), and <span class="italic">Face the Music</span> with Henry Hall. Comedy programmes starred Arthur Askey, Benny Hill, Frankie Howerd, Norman Wisdom, and Terry-Thomas. Panel programmes made household names of Gilbert Harding, Barbara Kelly, and Eamonn Andrews.<br>
<br>Within the television service light entertainment was not as highly regarded as drama and current affairs; but as Waldman welded his producers into a firmer unit, more programmes became successful, some outstandingly so. His visits to the United States taught him that the foundation of good programmes was to build series. He recruited the best comedy writers like Frank Muir and Denis Norden, who wrote <span class="italic">Whacko</span> for Jimmy Edwards, and he ensured that <span class="italic">Hancock's Half Hour</span>, starring Tony Hancock and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, was transferred triumphantly from radio to television. His support for the writers ensured that they stayed loyal to the BBC.<br>
<br>Among other successful programmes launched during Waldman's time were such landmarks in the television schedule as <span class="italic">The Billy Cotton Band Show</span>, <span class="italic">Dixon of Dock Green</span> with Jack Warner, and <span class="italic">This is your Life</span>. After the twenty-first anniversary of BBC television in November 1957, Waldman summed up his role: &#145;This is Our Life &hellip; to entertain 95 per cent of the people 95 per cent of the time&#146;  (Briggs, 4.139).<br>
<br>After more than seven years of leading light entertainment Waldman was appointed in 1958 to a new post dealing with buying, making, and selling telefilms. His energy and vitality, coupled with a shrewd business sense, led to a growing role for the BBC as an exporter of programmes. Waldman was well regarded as a BBC ambassador: he was a man of medium height, a warm smile, and always well dressed. He was promoted to general manager, TV Enterprises, in 1961 and was congratulated by the director-general, Hugh Carleton Greene, for his tenacity and cheerfulness in a pioneering task.<br>
<br>Waldman made his final career switch in 1963 when he was asked to head the British Commonwealth International Newsfilm Agency (BCINA). This was a BBC venture which brought together like-minded public service broadcasters from Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (and in addition the Rank Organization) to create a company which would bring about the fast flow of film (later videotapes) covering news events around the world. After an uncertain start BCINA became VisNews, and when the world-wide news agency Reuters joined, success followed. Waldman was a hands-on managing director and when he retired, aged sixty, in 1974, he had laid the foundations of a major international company that was to become Reuters Television.<br>
<br>Waldman died from cancer, aged sixty-three, at his home, 60 Wolsey Road, Moor Park, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, on 10 March 1978. He was survived by his wife and son, Simon (who also worked for BBC television, in the news department).<br>
